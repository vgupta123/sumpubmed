BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria produce a wealth of bioactive peptide derivatives with a broad range of biological activities and pharmacological properties  <cit> . many of these are synthesized on nonribosomal peptide synthetases . these megaenzyme complexes typically have a modular architecture. a typical module contains specific functional domains for activation, thioesterification, and condensation of amino acids  <cit> . additional domains for the modification of activated amino acids such as epimerization, heterocyclisation, oxidation, formylation, reduction or n-methylation may also be present  <cit> . nrps gene clusters in some cyanobacteria can occupy up to  <dig> percent of the genome  <cit> .

the modular design of nrps gene clusters promotes homologous recombination, including recombination within a gene cluster and intragenomic recombination between different gene clusters within the same genome or intergenomic recombination with dna introduced from other cyanobacteria  <cit> . the cellular consequences of recombination will depend on several factors, including the phenotypic effects, if any, of the introduced dna segment. in order to be successful, the new gene variant should at least not be detrimental to the host. for nrps systems, important factors will be whether the novel peptide can fulfil the biological role of the original peptide or provide new benefits to the host. nonetheless, recombination within and among nrps gene clusters potentially could constitute a mechanism for continuous alteration of the synthetases and peptide products.

among cyanobacterial nrpss, the microcystin synthetase gene clusters  have been extensively studied. microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides with common structure cyclo-d-ala1-x2-d-measp3-z4-adda5-d-glu6-mdha <dig> where d-measp is d-erythro-β-methyl-aspartic acid, adda is 3-amino-9-methoxy- <dig> ,8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-, -decadienoic acid, d-glu is d-iso-glutamic acid, and x and z are variable l-amino acids . complete gene cluster sequences are available from strains within the anabaena, microcystis and planktothrix genera  <cit> . recombination in the mcy gene clusters has been reported to involve equivalent modules, i.e. modules with the same position in similar gene clusters  <cit> , but also modules in different positions in similar gene clusters or from different gene clusters  <cit> . although most strains can produce a range of microcystin isoforms there is a single mcy gene cluster in the genome  <cit> , indicating that recombination events involving equivalent domains must be intergenomic.

the substrate specificity of the adenylation  domain is considered to be the primary determinant of substrate selection . recombination events involving a domains might lead to changes in substrate specificity and subsequently in the microcystin profile  <cit> . the a domains of modules mcyb <dig>  and mcyc recognise and activate the amino acids that are incorporated in the variable positions x and z of microcystin . these a domains have been extensively studied within microcystis  <cit> , and planktothrix  <cit> . within microcystis, recombination has lead to the presence of two types of a domains in different strains  <cit> : a mainly leu-activating a domain and a mainly arg-activating a domain that has a high sequence similarity to the arg-activating a domain in mcyc . recombination involving a domain coding regions of mcyb <dig> and mcyc has been detected in microcystis  <cit>  and anabaena  <cit> .

here, we compare mcyb <dig> and mcyc a domains in strains from the three main microcystin-producing genera: anabaena, microcystis and planktothrix to investigate the role of genomic processes in the reshaping of microcystin genes, enzyme complexes and corresponding peptides. we have looked for signs of recombination, both between equivalent and non-equivalent modules, as well as mutations and selective forces acting on these a domains.

RESULTS
in the present study, we have compared a domains of microcystin synthetase modules mcyb <dig> and mcyc from altogether  <dig> strains including  <dig> anabaena,  <dig> microcystis and  <dig> planktothrix strains with characterized microcystin-isoform profiles, including two non-producers . the profiles made it possible to identify the amino acid residue incorporated by each of these modules.

microcystin isoforms produced by different genera
in total, we identified  <dig> structural variants , mainly differing in the methylation status of d-asp <dig> or dha <dig>  but also the amino acid present at position x . seven different amino acid residues were found at position x, mainly leu, arg and homotyrosine , but also phe, homoisoleucine , homophenylalanine  and tyr, while only arg was found at position z .

the anabaena strains mainly produce mc-lr variants, but also several other isoforms, e.g. mc-rr and mc-htyr . nine microcystis strains produce mc-rr, either as the only isoform or together with mc-lr and/or mc-yr. one strain produces only mc-yr isoforms, while seven strains produce mc-lr isoforms  . two of the microcystis strains examined here have a partial deletion of the mcy gene cluster and do not produce microcystin  <cit> . within planktothrix,  <dig> of  <dig> strains produce mc-rr, either as the only isoform , together with mc-lr  or together with mc-lr and mc-htyr . the remaining three strains produce mainly mc-htyr, one of them together with mc-lr .

adenylation domain-encoding sequences of mcyb <dig> and mcyc
analysis of the mcyb <dig> sequences from anabaena and planktothrix revealed the presence of a single type of a domain with a high degree of sequence similarity to the a domain of mcyc. among microcystis,  <dig> strains were found to possess a b-type  and  <dig> strains a c-like  a domain in mcyb <dig> . phylogenetic analyses of cyanobacterial a domains have shown that the mcyb <dig> sequence from microcystis strain pcc  <dig>  does not cluster with mcyc a domain sequences as do mcyb <dig> sequences from anabaena and planktothrix, but clusters with other leu activating a domains  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> mcyb <dig> and mcyc a domain sequences aligned with the remaining mcy adenylation domains from microcystis, anabaena and planktothrix  showed also that mcyb <dig> b-type a domains of microcystis form a clade separate from other mcyb <dig> and mcyc sequences . therefore, in the comparisons below of mcyb <dig> sequences from all three genera, only the c-like mcyb <dig> sequences of microcystis were included.

the variation measured as percentage divergence and nucleotide diversity  within the mcyb <dig> sequences was similar in anabaena  and microcystis  and slightly lower  in the planktothrix data set. the sequence variation within mcyc was low in anabaena  and planktothrix  and similar to that of mcyb <dig> in the microcystis data set  . when c-like a domain encoding sequences in mcyb <dig> were compared with the mcyc sequence from the same strain, genus-specific differences in the genetic variation were observed:  <dig> – <dig> %  in anabaena strains,  <dig> – <dig> %  in microcystis strains and  <dig> – <dig> %  in planktothrix strains . interestingly, the sequences from the non-producing microcystis strains did not diverged from the rest, suggesting insufficient time for any divergence or that the selective constraints still are the same.

variation in evolutionary rates between genera and between mcyb <dig> and mcyc
phylogenetic analyses of the amino acid sequence alignment of the  <dig> mcyb <dig> and mcyc a domain sequences yielded a similar tree topology for all methods used . five well-supported main clades were observed: mcyb1/mcyc of anabaena, mcyb <dig> of microcystis, mcyc of microcystis, mcyb <dig> of planktothrix and mcyc of planktothrix. all clades were genus-specific. the mcyb <dig> and mcyc sequences from microcystis formed two separate clades, as did the mcyb <dig> and mcyc sequences from planktothrix, but the a domains of planktothrix were separated on longer branches. interestingly, within the anabaena clade, no distinct, well-supported mcyc clade was inferred. almost all anabaena mcyb <dig> sequences formed a clade with moderate support , except for the sequences from strains  <dig>  n-c 267/ <dig> and 18b <dig>  the mcyb <dig> sequence from strain 18b <dig> clustered with the mcyc sequence from the same strain with moderate support .

mutation rates and recombination within- and between mcyb <dig> and mcyc adenylation domains
the mutation rates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , being lowest in mcyc of anabaena and planktothrix . moderate recombination levels   were detected in all data sets except for mcyc from planktothrix. low recombination levels were estimated for this data set, but all three permutation tests indicated that recombination rate was not statistically significant different from  <dig>  recombination rate/mutation rate ratios below  <dig> in the microcystis and planktothrix data sets  suggest that point mutations are the main cause of genetic variation in mcyb <dig> and mcyc a domains from these genera. in contrast, a recombination rate/mutation rate ratio higher than  <dig> in the anabaena data sets indicates that recombination has had a major impact on these a domains.

recombination events were also suggested in all data sets by the mosaic structure of informative sites, with the exception of mcyc from planktothrix . the reticulate phylogenies revealed by the split decomposition analysis  were supported by phi test  in all data sets except mcyc from planktothrix. recombination detection programs  identified several recombination breakpoints along the entire mcyb <dig> sequences in anabaena and planktothrix strains, while only one single putative recombination event was detected within the microcystis mcyb <dig> and mcyc data sets . no recombination events were suggested by recombination detection programs within the mcyc alignments of anabaena and planktothrix. the analyses of the combined mcyb1c data sets  suggested recombination events between mcyb <dig> and mcyc in anabaena and microcystis, but not in planktothrix.

substrate specificity of mycb <dig> and mcyc adenylation domains
mcyb <dig> and mcyc a domain sequences were aligned with the phe-activating a domain of grsa  <cit>  to identify the binding-pocket residues. the binding pocket signatures of mcyc a domains  were more or less identical within the genus, while only five residues are identical in binding pocket signatures from all three genera . binding pocket signatures are more diverse in mcyb <dig> a domains, reflecting the diversity of amino acid residues incorporated in position x . some mcyb <dig> modules with identical binding pocket signatures incorporate a somewhat different set of amino acid residues , indicating that other residues in the a domain or other domains, such as the condensation domain influence substrate specificity. a role of the condensation domain in substrate selection has been suggested by several studies .

*according to isoforms produced

adenylation domains and selective forces
an excess of synonymous over non-synonymous substitutions   was observed in all data sets, indicating that the a domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc overall are under purifying selection in all three genera. small fractions  of codons under positive selection were detected in all data sets except for mcyc from planktothrix . the number of potential sites under positive selection with statistical support  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and their positions in the a domain alignment are shown in figure  <dig>  interestingly, in both anabaena data sets as well as in the planktothrix mcyb <dig> data set, the binding pocket residue  <dig>  appears to be under positive selection. in the microcystis mcyc data set, this is also the case for the amino acid residue between binding pocket residues  <dig> and  <dig> . among residues not present in binding pocket signatures, site  <dig> in the mcyc alignments in both microcystis and anabaena and site  <dig> in both microcystis data sets  were suggested to be under positive selection.

discussion
this study is so far the most extensive comparative analysis of microcystin synthetase adenylation domains for the modules mcyb <dig> and mcyc. the phylogenetic trees of the  <dig> adenylation domain sequences showed clustering according to module and genus . our data set revealed no signs of recombination between genera, in agreement with previous studies on mcy genes  <cit>  and similar studies from other nrps gene clusters  <cit> . this also is in line with other studies that show that the rate of successful homologous recombination rapidly is reduced with increased genetic distance  <cit> .

the evolutionary history of the mcyb <dig> a domain
it is not clear at present which of the two types of a domains in mcyb <dig>  was present in the ancestral microcystin synthetase. a b-type ancestral a domain implies that after segregation of the genera, some microcystis strains and all anabaena and planktothrix acquired a c-like type of a domain in mcyb <dig>  most likely through intragenomic recombination between mcyb <dig> and mcyc, as suggested for hapalosiphon hibernicus and anabaena strain 18b <dig>  <cit> . if the ancestral mcyb <dig> a domain was c-like, some microcystis strains must have obtained a novel mcyb <dig> a domain, presumably through recombination with a different nrps gene cluster. recently, the presence of a leu-activating, b-type mcyb <dig> a domain was reported in two nostoc strains  <cit>  and this may in contrast strengthen the hypothesis that the ancestral a domain in mcyb <dig> was b-type. however, the b-type a domain sequences from microcystis and nostoc seem to be separated by rather long phylogenetic distances, suggesting that these a domains were introduced in the mcyb <dig> module by two independent recombination events  <cit> . clearly, further studies are needed to clarify the evolutionary history of the mcyb <dig> a domain.

genomic processes reshaping the adenylation domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc
our results suggest that recombinations as well as point mutations contribute to variation in the a domains of modules mcyb <dig> and mcyc. within anabaena and microcystis, frequent recombination was suggested both within and between mcyb <dig> and mcyc sequences . the low sequence variation  within planktothrix mcyc sequences makes it difficult to detect recombination, since for the majority of methods, a minimum sequence variation of 5% is necessary to obtain substantial power  <cit> . the large sequence divergence between planktothrix mcyb <dig> and mcyc sequences might prevent homology-driven recombination, which requires a relatively high level of sequence similarity between the donor and recipient dna. in planktothrix, the longest identical dna segment shared by mcyb <dig> and mcyc  may be too short for initiation of reca-mediated recombination  <cit> . within anabaena and microcystis, the high sequence similarity between these gene segments appears to be maintained by frequent recombination events. recombination between different domains, such as mcyb <dig> and mcyc, has in some cases lead to replacement of a nearly entire a domain  and in others to replacement of a functionally important part of the domain in mcyb <dig>  . in both cases this has resulted in a change of functionality  and subsequent production of microcystin-rr.

our results, together with previous reports  <cit> , indicate that various types of recombination lead to a continual restyling  of the adenylation domains of microcystin synthetase. recombination within a single domain appears to be frequent and may have little impact on the type of amino acid activated. recombination between mcyb <dig> and mcyc appears to be frequent in some genera and may result in changes in the microcystin profile of the recombinant strains. successful recombination between a domain regions from different nrps gene clusters  <cit>  were found to be infrequent in the strains investigated here.

positive selection in the adenylation domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc
overall, the adenylation domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc seem to be under purifying selection, as shown previously for other segments of the mcy gene cluster  <cit> , indicating that mutations that affect the amino acid sequence of these domains generally are deleterious. however, the ω-values  observed in this study are relatively high compared to ω-values reported for several cyanobacterial house keeping genes   <cit> , implying a relaxation of selective constraints.

amino acid residues in the a domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc that seem to be under positive selective pressure are located throughout the entire analyzed sequence . among the positively selected amino acids, residues included in binding pocket signatures are particularly interesting, since they may influence the active site selectivity  <cit> . the amino acid change phe→cys in binding pocket position  <dig>  in the mcyb <dig> sequences of anabaena is an example of this. according to the peptide profiles of the anabaena strains , this change is associated with the incorporation of hty/leu, rather than only leu . also, the leu→phe exchange at the binding pocket position  <dig> in the mcyb <dig> sequences of planktothrix  is associated with a change in incorporation from hty to arg. one could hypothesize that positive selection of these and other residues in the synthetases reflect selection of a particular peptide profile produced by the corresponding strains. such a causative relationship between these specific genetic changes and phenotypic effects remains to be demonstrated.

interestingly, a binding pocket residue under positive selection is also present in the mcyc sequences of anabaena . since all mcyc modules studied here mainly incorporate arg, the selection seemingly does not concern gross substrate specificity. other properties, like nrps catalytic efficiency or the ability to produce minor variants, might be the properties selected for. also in mcyb <dig> sequences from all genera there are several positively selected amino acid residues not associated with substrate selectivity, indicating that some other property is selected for in these a domains. this could for instance again be changes in the catalytic efficiency or in the interactions between neighboring domains and modules.

sequence comparisons show that the a domain of mcyc is more conserved than the mcyb <dig> a domain – also reflected by the lack of amino acid variation in position z of the produced peptides. within planktothrix, a lower recombination rate and stronger purifying selection compared to anabaena and microcystis indicate stronger functional constraints.

CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed no clear indications of recombination across the genera, while frequent recombination events both within and between mcyb and mcyc sequences were detected between strains from same genus, except for mcyc from planktothrix. we demonstrate remodelling of mcyb and mcyc genes including evidence for positive selection acting at some sites, indicating that the microcystin variant profile of a given strain is likely to influence the ability of the strain to interact with its environment.
