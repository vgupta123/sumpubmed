BACKGROUND
optically pure 2-hydroxycarboxylic acids are important intermediates in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries  <cit> . --mandelic acid is one of the important 2-hydroxycarboxylic acids, which is widely used for the production of semisynthetic cephalosporins  <cit> , penicillins  <cit> , antitumor agents  <cit> , and antiobesity agents  <cit> . it is also used as a universal acidic chiral resolving agent for the resolution of racemic alcohols and amines  <cit> .

several methods have been proposed for the production of optically pure --mandelic acid  <cit> . among these methods, nitrilase-mediated pathway is increasingly popular because of its lack of cofactor involvement, cheap starting material in the form of mandelonitrile, high enantioselectivity, and theoretically 100% of the product  <cit> . however, these reported nitrilases either have low enantioselectivity or low specific activity toward mandelonitrile  <cit> . furthermore, some also produce a byproduct in the form of mandelamide  <cit> . therefore, an ideal nitrilase that can efficiently hydrolyze mandelonitrile to optically pure --mandelic acid without the unwanted byproduct is needed.

several approaches have been developed to discover novel nitrilases toward mandelonitrile  <cit> . among these approaches, an enrichment culture  <cit>  and the metagenome approach  <cit>  have been used successfully. however, these methods require screening a large number of clones, and are thereby time consuming. considering that the number of genes increases exponentially based on an automated genome annotation in the database, genome mining has become increasingly popular in the recent years. researchers can easily find many genes with a defined function, such as nitrilase, from databases, such as genbank, pfam, and brenda. nitrilases of interest can be discovered more efficiently by combining the existing methods with substrate specificity prediction. zhu et al.  <cit>  discovered a mandelonitrile hydrolase  by combining traditional mining with the functional analysis of the flanking genes around this nitrilase. this nitrilase was organized in a mandelonitrile metabolic pathway and displayed high activity toward mandelonitrile. seffernick et al.  <cit>  also discovered a nitrilase and another mandelonitrile hydrolase from burkholderia xenovorans lb <dig> using computational methods. however, these two nitrilases exhibited no or only slight enantioselectivity in producing --mandelic acid.

in our study, phylogeny-based enzymatic substrate specificity prediction  was introduced for the efficient discovery of an ideal nitrilase to solve the problems of unwanted byproduct production, low enantioselectivity, and specific activity. a novel nitrilase  was discovered from burkholderia cenocepacia j <dig>  bcj <dig> could efficiently hydrolyze mandelonitrile to --mandelic acid with high enantioselectivity. no byproduct was observed in the hydrolysis process. bcj <dig> was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli m <dig>  and its catalytic properties were investigated by analyzing its substrate specificity and kinetic parameters. the catalytic efficiency of the recombinant e. coli m15/bcj <dig> was also tested in the hydrolyzing mandelonitrile biotransformation to --mandelic acid to investigate the potential of bcj <dig> further.

RESULTS
discovery of a predicted mandelonitrile hydrolase subgroup through pessp
based on the screening criteria mentioned in database mining and sequence analysis section, a total of  <dig> proteins were chosen for the mandelonitrile hydrolase activity assay . these proteins were annotated as nitrilase, putative nitrilase, aliphatic nitrilase, and unnamed protein products. among the  <dig> proteins,  <dig> were experimentally determined to have a nitrilase activity with different substrate specificities. for example, the nitrilase from rhodococcus rhodochrous j <dig>  <cit>  was designated as an aromatic nitrilase. the nitrilases from synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  <cit>  and acidovorax facilis 72w  <cit>  were specific to aliphatic nitrile. the nitrilase from pseudomonas fluorescens pf- <dig>  <cit>  had a regioselective activity toward aliphatic dinitrile. the nitrilases from alcaligenes faecalis jm <dig>  <cit> , pseudomonas fluorescens ebc <dig>  <cit> , bradyrhizobium japonicum usda <dig>  <cit> , burkholderia xenovorans lb <dig>  <cit> , and an uncultured organism   <cit>  were characterized as mandelonitrile hydrolases. finally, a cluster containing all the defined mandelonitrile hydrolases was found based on the phylogenetic analysis . seven proteins were not characterized experimentally within this cluster, and their functions remained unclear. based on the substrate specificities of the defined nitrilases, this cluster was designated as the predicted mandelonitrile hydrolase subgroup. the uncharacterized seven proteins in this subgroup were further studied.

a blastp was performed by comparing the amino acid sequence with that of the mandelonitrile hydrolase  from bradyrhizobium japonicum usda  <dig> 

b the enzymes were experimentally characterized to harbor nitrilase activity.

identification of bcj <dig> from the predicted mandelonitrile hydrolase subgroup
the respective genes of the seven proteins were cloned and overexpressed in e. coli to verify whether these uncharacterized proteins in the predicted mandelonitrile hydrolase subgroup have a mandelonitrile hydrolase activity. the resulting recombinant histidine -tagged proteins were all soluble and purified to homogeneity for the catalytic activity assay. all the seven enzymes were active toward mandelonitrile and have relatively high enantioselectivity . among these enzymes, bcj <dig> from burkholderia cenocepacia j <dig> exhibited the highest specific activity  and enantioselectivity . only the sa <dig> produced amide as a reaction byproduct. the sequence analysis of bcj <dig> showed 52%, 59%, 56%, 60%, and 66% identities with the nitrilases from alcaligenes faecalis jm <dig>  <cit> , pseudomonas fluorescens ebc <dig>  <cit> , bradyrhizobium japonicum usda <dig>  <cit> , burkholderia xenovorans lb <dig>  <cit> , and an uncultured organism   <cit> , respectively. the highest identity was 71% compared with nitrilase  from an uncultured organism discovered by robertson et al.  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first report of nitrilase bcj <dig>  bcj <dig> was chosen for further study because it had the highest activity and enantioselectivity toward mandelonitrile.

the rest of the uncharacterized genes outside the predicted mandelonitrile hydrolase subgroup in the phylogenetic tree were also cloned and overexpressed in e. coli  so that any other nitrilases with good characteristics toward mandelonitrile would not be missed. after optimizing the expression conditions  concentration, and expression vector/host), all the enzymes were expressed in a soluble form and showed activity toward at least one of the four assayed nitrile substrates . the recombinant his-tagged proteins were purified for the mandelonitrile hydrolase activity assay. little to no activity was observed in the high-performance liquid chromatography  analysis after  <dig> h of hydrolysis . this result further proved the accuracy of the prediction based on phylogenetic analysis.

properties of the purified bcj2315
the molecular weight of the purified native bcj <dig> estimated by conducting a gel filtration chromatography was about  <dig> kda. bcj <dig> showed one single band on the sds-page with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda . this result indicated that the native bcj <dig> consisted of  <dig> subunits with identical sizes, which is in agreement with most nitrilases reported with  <dig> to  <dig> identical subunits that self-aggregated to form active enzymes  <cit> .

the optimum temperature and ph of the purified bcj <dig> were determined. the optimum temperature was 45°c, as shown in figure 3a. when the temperature was above 45°c, the activity of bcj <dig> decreased sharply. this behavior is similar to the nitrilases reported from mesophilic organisms, having optimum temperatures ranging from 30°c to 50°c  <cit> . bcj <dig> showed the highest activity at ph  <dig>  . only small changes in activity were observed between ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . these variations suggested that bcj <dig> had a relatively broad optimum ph in contrast to other arylacetonitrilases that have a rather narrow optimum ph at neutral or slightly alkaline ph values  <cit> .

the catalytic activity of bcj <dig> toward  <dig> different nitriles with structural diversity was investigated. table  <dig> lists the relative activities determined by quantifying the amount of ammonia released during the hydrolysis. a clear preference of bcj <dig> for arylacetonitriles as substrates indicated that this enzyme is an arylacetonitrilase. a lower activity was also observed with the aliphatic and heterocyclic nitriles. no detectable activities were observed with the aromatic nitriles. bcj <dig> showed the highest activity toward mandelonitrile , indicating that bcj <dig> is a highly active mandelonitrile hydrolase. moreover, the activities of other arylacetonitrilases, such as alcaligenes faecalis atcc  <dig>  <cit> , alcaligenes sp. ecu <dig>  <cit> , alcaligenes faecalis zjutb <dig>  <cit> , alcaligenes faecalis jm <dig>  <cit> , and pseudomonas putida <cit> , toward mandelonitrile are only 12% to 50% of that for phenylacetonitrile.

a nitrilase activity against various nitriles was measured under standard assay conditions. the activity toward phenylacetonitrile was defined as 100%.

the kinetic parameters of bcj <dig> were determined using mandelonitrile as substrate. the obtained km and vmax were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  μmol/min/mg, respectively. the low value of km indicated that bcj <dig> had high affinity toward mandelonitrile. the km-values of other highly enantioselective mandelonitrile hydrolases were one to three orders of magnitude higher  than that of bcj <dig>   <cit> . the kcat and kcat/km were  <dig>  s- <dig> and  <dig> × <dig> m-1s- <dig>  respectively. bcj <dig> also had a high catalytic efficiency, comparable with that of the nitrilase  from bradyrhizobium japonicum usda <dig>   <cit> .

bcj <dig> exhibited a relatively high specific activity  among the reported mandelonitrile hydrolases. it has the 2nd highest activity of all known highly enantioselective nitrilases in literature . the highest specific activity toward mandelonitrile was observed with nitrilase i  from an uncultured organism discovered by robertson et al. nitrilase i also has an excellent enantioselectivity toward mandelonitrile , 98%) and mandelonitrile derivatives  <cit> . strangely, these two nitrilases only shared a 66% identity in the amino acid sequence, probably because of the method we used . the pessp method discovered new enzymes based on their substrate specificity toward mandelonitrile, other than the sequence identity. therefore, despite the low identity between these two nitrilases, they were successfully clustered together into the predicted mandelonitrile hydrolase subgroup. pessp exhibited an advantage in searching for enzymes with similar characteristics, although these enzymes may be quite different in the amino acid sequence. a higher specific activity was also observed with the nitrilases from pseudomonas fluorescens ebc <dig>  and bradyrhizobium japonicum usda <dig> . however, these two nitrilases had lower ees, and the nitrilase from pseudomonas fluorescens ebc <dig> also produced amide as a byproduct. the other highly enantioselective mandelonitrile hydrolases from alcaligenes sp. ecu <dig>  alcaligenes faecalis jm <dig>  aspergillus niger cbs  <dig> , neurospora crassa or74a, pseudomonas putida and alcaligenes faecalis atcc <dig> exhibited a relatively low specific activity . thus, when the specific activity, enantioselectivity, and production of unwanted byproducts were taken into account, bcj <dig> demonstrated a great potential for the industrial production of optically pure --mandelic acid.

conversion of mandelonitrile by the recombinant e. coli m15/bcj2315
whole cell biocatalysis was performed using the recombinant e. coli m15/bcj <dig> as biocatalyst to estimate the potential of bcj <dig> for mandelonitrile hydrolysis further. an optimization of the reaction conditions for m15/bcj <dig> was performed by evaluating the effect of ph, temperature, cell concentration, and mandelonitrile concentration in a reaction system of  <dig> ml. the optimal reaction system consisted of wet cells  and mandelonitrile  in  <dig> ml of phosphate buffer  . although the optimal temperature was 45°c, we conducted the reaction at 30°c to consider the thermal deactivation of the enzyme. the reaction process is shown in figure  <dig>  considering that mandelonitrile can be decomposed into benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide in aqueous solution at ph  <dig>  and above, the benzaldehyde concentration was also plotted into the figure to help understand the mechanism of the mandelonitrile hydrolysis mediated by m15/bcj <dig>  the mandelonitrile  could be hydrolyzed completely by m15/bcj <dig> within  <dig> h. no mandelamide was detected during the reaction. the ee value for the --mandelic acid was constant at  <dig> % during the whole hydrolysis process. finally, the --mandelic acid was recovered with a total yield of  <dig> %. the ee of the production was determined as  <dig> % after the recrystallization in benzene through hplc. the product was characterized as follows: d <dig> = − <dig>     <cit> ; 1h nmr : δ <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   ppm.

among the reported nitrilase-mediated hydrolysis of mandelonitrile, only the nitrilase from alcaligenes sp. ecu <dig> could enantioselectively hydrolyze mandelonitrile in a high substrate concentration  <cit> . when  <dig> mm of mandelonitrile was used, the yield of the --mandelic acid reached 100% with wet cells  in  <dig> h and the ee was as high as 99%. in the current study, we used less biocatalysts  to realize the hydrolysis of the same mandelonitrile concentration  with a high enantioselectivity  in  <dig> h of reaction time. this result may be due to the high specific activity of bcj <dig> and the high soluble expression in e. coli. the biocatalyst preparation accounts for a great part of the total cost of an enzymatic process. therefore, using m15/bcj <dig> for the production of --mandelic acid is beneficial in two ways, i.e., the processing time is shorter and require less amount of biocatalyst , thereby significantly reducing the production cost compared with other reported systems.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel mandelonitrile hydrolase bcj <dig> was discovered from burkholderia cenocepacia j <dig> through pessp. bcj <dig> took mandelonitrile as its optimal substrate and exhibited great advantages in the production of optically pure --mandelic acid. these advantages include a high enantioselectivity and activity, strong substrate tolerance, and having no byproduct. these advantages make bcj <dig> more efficient in the hydrolysis of mandelonitrile. thus, bcj <dig> has a great potential in the practical production of optically pure --mandelic acid.
