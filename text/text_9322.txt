BACKGROUND
genetic variations contribute to normal phenotypic variation  <cit> . for human, it is estimated that there are more than  <dig> million snps  with an observed minor allele frequency of â‰¥ 1% in the population  <cit> . recent advances in sequencing technologies  <cit>  have enabled rapid discovery of other types of variations, including mutations expected to have very large effects on protein function such as frame shifting insertions and deletions  and nonsense mutations . amazingly, insertions and deletions are also abundant in the human genome with sizes ranging from single to several million base pairs   <cit> . for example, in  <dig> human genomes there were  <dig>  million short indels identified  <cit>  indicating an estimate of  <dig> million indels per human genome . similarly, recent studies have revealed a surprising number  of nonsense mutations per genome observed  <cit> . consistent with these data from humans, recent studies in model organisms such as yeast have also revealed an abundance of variants that would be expected to have large effects on phenotype  <cit> .

large-effect mutations  are often assumed to have significant functional impacts, and therefore are likely to cause disease. however, discovery of a large numbers of these variants suggest that many of them might in fact have no  impact on function  <cit> . a quick survey of dbsnp  <cit>  reveals that of  <dig> nonsense mutations  and  <dig> frame-shifting  indels have been identified in humans, of which only  <dig>  nms and  <dig>  fs indels have been clinically studied . thus, identification of the fraction of these variations that contribute to diseases from those with little effect on function is a great practical challenge  <cit> .

even in cases where the variations are detected in individuals with diseases, identification of the causative variations is a major challenge. for instance, there are  <dig> structural variants  catalogued in the cosmic project  <cit>  that are potentially associated with lung cancer. similar observations can be made at the level of individual important disease genes: studies of tp <dig>  have identified  <dig> somatic,  <dig> cell-line and  <dig> germline fs indels  <cit>  as well as  <dig> somatic,  <dig> cell-line and  <dig> germline nms. similarly, there are  <dig> fs indels as well as  <dig> nms identified in cftr . in all these cases, the identification of causative variations in the list of potential candidates remains a challenge.

as the number of observed mutations increases, it quickly becomes infeasible for researchers to manually assess the impact of each one in laboratory. it is therefore becoming absolutely essential to rank the effect of these variations in terms of their impact to define priority in clinical research as well as to weight their effects in association analyses.

there is a wide range of computational methods that predict the effect of snp on protein function . despite existing interest, to the extent of our knowledge, none of these methods are able to deal with indels and nms. here we propose to use evolutionary conservation principles to rank the effect of these variations on genetic information.

evolutionary conservation has been previously used for predicting the effect of snps on protein function  <cit>  as well as on non-coding dna  <cit> . in sift  <cit>  the conservation of amino-acid residues are measured using protein sequence homology. in this method, a non-synonymous snp  that substitutes a highly conserved residue  is predicted to have a more deleterious effect. similarly, in the case of non-coding dna, in the so-called lr test  <cit> , a snp is predicted to have more deleterious effect if it causes greater change in the rate of evolution of the dna site that it alters.

we argue that the underlying ideas used in these methods, i.e. using the evolutionary conservation context  <cit>  of the sequence that harbours the mutation for assessing the mutation impact, can be extended to rank the net effect of indels and nms. in particular, for the protein coding sequences, we propose a scoring scheme that measures the amount of the loss of protein "information content"  <cit>  caused by a nm or fs indel. we expect the variations that interfere with conserved residues of a protein to a larger extent to have more deleterious effects. for the non-coding dna, we propose to use a likelihood-ratio scoring scheme to measure the conservation of the dna bases that harbour the indels. we argue that indels that fall in highly conserved dna sites are expected to have more deleterious effects.

to evaluate our hypothesis, we study the effect of indels and nms in a population of saccharomyces cerevisiae  yeast  <cit> . we provide evidence that mutations that disrupt the most highly conserved regions segregate at significantly lower allele frequencies. the paucity of variations in lower allele frequencies suggests that highly deleterious mutations have been removed from the population  <cit> .

next, we assess the effects of fs indels as well as nms on human proteins  <cit> . we show that variations with no disease association tend to cause less information loss than those associated with disease, suggesting that variations not associated with disease are likely to have less deleterious effects. we further show that nms that cause higher information loss in human proteins segregate significantly in lower allele frequencies suggesting that not all nms have the same deleterious effects. we argue that the scoring scheme that quantifies the information loss can be used to rank the effect of mutations in human population.

RESULTS
large-effect mutations in protein coding dna
sift  <cit>  predicts a non-synonymous snp to be deleterious if it disrupts a highly conserved amino acid residue in a protein sequence, where the conservation of any residue is measured using an alignment of homologous protein sequences.

we propose that the same principle applies to variations that affect more than one amino acid residue. we know that a fs indel changes the translated amino acid residues from its position to the end of the protein, and a nm causes a premature termination of the amino acid sequence. thus, in order to extend the approach taken in sift, we simply add up the effects of each residue affected. in doing so we are assuming that changes in amino acid residues contribute independently to the overall function of the protein, obviously an over-simplification .

scores used in sift are based on a "normalized" transition probability matrix  that is built using an alignment of protein sequences homologous to the target protein. the tpm is not suitable for adding the effect of mutations on multiple residues because each column is normalized such that for any residue, the most likely transition is normalized to  <dig>  since the absolute maxima of the observed probabilities are lost in the normalization, the scores cannot be used to compare the residues or, in our case, to add the effect of substitutions for a number of residues together.

therefore, we modify the scoring method used in sift by using the conventional definition of information carried by biological sequences  . according to this definition, protein residues that are important for the species are evolutionarily conserved and therefore have a statistically different distribution compared to the freely evolving residues that are under no selection. biological information corresponds to the difference between the distribution of conserved and non-conserved  sequence. we quantify this difference as follows.

let us consider a multiple alignment of n protein sequences with length w . we define the position weight matrix , f, as follows:  

where, for instance, f1a represents the relative frequency of amino acid residue "a" in the 1st column of the alignment covering all the  <dig> protein amino acids. for a freely evolving set of sequences, this matrix is close to the so-called background distribution g of the genome . however, when the sequence alignment is conserved, the pwm, f, is different from the background distribution. for any residue xi in a given protein sequence, x, we measure the information content by the ratio of the likelihood that the residue is generated according to the distribution fi and the likelihood that it is drawn from a background distribution g  <cit> :  

where, for instance, xia  =  <dig> if the residue at ith column is amino-acid residue "a". the score s shows how likely is that the residue xi is generated from the distribution fi . this score is closely related to the relative information and hence our interpretation of information carried by xi  <cit> . the total score of a sequence, s, is defined as the sum of information carried by individual residues.

now suppose that the residue xi is substituted by a residue yi. the amount of change in the information carried at site i is given by:  

when di >  <dig> we say that the residue i has lost information compared to the original sequence. in rare cases that we observe an increase in the score, i.e. di <  <dig>  we conclude that the genetic event has increased the information content of the residue, i.e. it has a beneficial effect for the gene. the total loss of information, d, of the sequence is defined as a normalized sum of information losses due to individual residues:  

by combining the effects of change in individual residues we assume that residues contribute independently to the information loss  of the sequence. we normalize the loss of information to the total score, s  sequence), to obtain a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the information loss between protein sequences.

our predictions are based on the information loss score d which defines a normalized ratio of the information content s of the protein without  and with the mutation . the larger the score d is the greater is the information loss due to the mutation. we use this score to rank the effect of mutations.

as an example, consider the human proteins nf <dig>  <cit> . a nm at dna base  <dig>  of nf <dig> is associated with neurofibromatosis type-i  <cit>  . the premature stop codon caused by this mutation cuts short the protein at residue  <dig>  the information loss due to this mutation is proportional to the sum of information that was carried by residues that are not a part of the translated amino acid sequence any more. similarly, a fs deletion at site  <dig> of the human protein pten  <cit>  has been shown to be associated with a type of skin cancer  <cit> . the amino acid residues after the shift caused by the deletion are different from their original wts . the information loss, in this case, is a normalized difference between the s scores of the mutant and the wt sequences. for the case of the nm of g to t at the base  <dig> of the tp <dig> tumour repressor protein  <cit> , the score of the mutation is considerably lower, consistent with the location of the mutation at the c-terminus of the protein. table  <dig> shows corresponding scores for these three genes.

information loss due to mutations on human genes

effect of mutation in non-coding dna
it is widely accepted that the non-coding dna harbours many functional elements  <cit>  and that variations in these regions can have phenotypic effects and cause disease  <cit> . we use conservation of bases in the non-coding dna to assess the impact of these variations. while in principle, a similar approach used for computing the information loss in coding regions could also be applied to the non-coding dna, building sequence alignments of homologous non-coding dna from distantly related species is infeasible due to the relatively fast rates of evolution.

we must therefore use an approach based on sequence alignments from closely related species, where conservation of functional elements in non-coding dna is detectable  <cit> . we hypothesize that mutations that fall into most conserved sites have more deleterious effects compared to others that do not disrupt conserved regions  <cit>  .

consider  <dig> base-pair  wide regions of non-coding dna upstream of genes. given an alignment of dna sequences of width w, we measure conservation of a dna site by the log-likelihood ratio   <cit> :  

whereÎ»synis the average rate of evolution of synonymous mutations in the coding dna of the protein and  is the maximum likelihood estimate of the rate of evolution of the non-coding dna site. here t is the evolutionary tree of the species being used in building the dna alignments. the llr measures how fast a dna site is evolving compared to the synonymous rate of evolution of the protein coding dna. slowly evolving sites  give larger llr values. for these sites, the likelihood  that the site is evolving according to the rate Î»*  is significantly greater than the likelihood that the site is evolving as fast as the synonymous rate of protein coding region. alternatively, the dna sites that evolve at a rate similar to the synonymous sites in the coding region are not conserved and therefore give a lower llr scores.

the results of our analysis provide evidence that llr score can also be used to measure the effect of indels that disrupt the conserved dna sites. a similar approach was previously used in  <cit>  to assess the effect of snps in non-coding as well as the protein-coding regions  <cit> .

genome-wide population analysis with mutations in yeast protein coding regions
we sought to test whether our scores for large-effect mutations reflected their functional impact. more deleterious variants are expected to segregate at lower frequencies in the population and occur at lower densities that would be expected of neutral variants  <cit> . therefore, in a natural population, we expect mutations with larger predicted effects to segregate at lower frequencies and be found at lower densities than mutations with smaller predicted effects.

using sequence data from a population of  <dig> strains of s.cer  <cit> , we identified genes that contain single nm as well as genes with a single fs indel. we first computed the derived allele frequency spectrum  and tested for a shift towards lower dafs   <cit> , which is expected under purifying selection  <cit> . we confirmed that fs causing indels segregate at significantly lower frequencies  test, p < 10-6) than do in-frame indels  . similarly, we found a significant skew to the left for nms  suggesting that they segregate at much lower frequency in the population than do synonymous polymorphisms .

in order to test whether our information-based score differentiates fs indels that are likely to be deleterious from those that are likely to be neutral, we computed the fraction of high frequency alleles defined as daf >  <dig> . we compared this fraction between genes with higher score, i.e. d >  <dig> , which we considered to have a greater deleterious effects, and genes with score less than  <dig>  .

we found, for the case of fs indels  that the fraction of high frequency alleles for the genes with d >  <dig>  was significantly less than the fraction of high frequency alleles for genes with for the genes with d <  <dig>   . for the nms, the results were inconclusive because we did not observe mutations with high allele frequency . the paucity of high frequency alleles is consistent with stronger purifying selection on the mutations we predicted to be more deleterious .

to test for the effects of selection on the density of variations, we compared the distribution of scores to that expected if the mutations were randomly placed. for this purpose, we generated  <dig> sets of variations randomly placed on genes in our dataset and computed the information loss scores for them. we then compared the distribution of the scores from the  <dig> random datasets to the distribution of scores obtained from our yeast dataset. as can be seen from figure 4a and figure 4b, these distributions are significantly different  such that there is a great enrichment of mutations with very small scores, d <<  <dig> . this suggests that purifying selection has acted to remove mutations with greater score d from the population.

genome-wide population analysis of indels in yeast non-coding dna
we identified indels that fall within the promoter regions  of genes in a population of  <dig> strains of s.cer budding yeast  <cit> . for each identified indel, we computed the conservation of surrounding dna site  using an alignment of non-coding dna sequences of orthologues genes from  <dig> closely related yeast species .

we sought to test whether indels that fall in highly conserved dna sites segregate at lower dafs compared to those that do not disrupt conserved dna sites . for this purpose, we define a llr score threshold thr =  <dig>  for dividing indels into two sets: those that fall into highly conserved dna sites  and those that fall in less conserved dna site . the threshold thr =  <dig>  is estimated such that the difference between the selection coefficients of the two classes is maximal .

to test for the effects of selection on the density of indels, we compared the distribution of dna sites with respect to their llr scores with what is expected if the indels were placed randomly. for this purpose, we generated  <dig> sets of indels distributed randomly in the  <dig> bp upstream of all genes in the reference s.cer and computed the llr scores for the corresponding dna sites in which they fall. figure 4e shows that the distribution for dna sites in our dataset is significantly different than the random dataset , such that there is a great enrichment of sites with lower llr scores. this suggests that indels at highly conserved dna sites have been removed from the population by purifying selection.

ranking of mutations in yeast
our method identifies candidates for new deleterious variations in a pool of genes with mutations. we ranked the mutations in our yeast dataset in terms of their deleterious effects on the corresponding proteins. in the following, we study the top ranked fs indels and the nms with lowest scores.

a sample of ranked genes in terms of their information loss score d.  the top  <dig> genes with fs indels with highest scores  the bottom  <dig> genes with nms with lowest scores.

one of the other top ranked indel predictions was in tfb <dig>  a reduction in the function of the gene tfb <dig> is associated with an increase in resistance to the same drug  <cit> . interestingly, we observed the expected effects in the  <dig> individuals that carry the fs indel . specifically, the  <dig> individuals were among the  <dig> individuals that had res > - <dig> . because of the small number of individuals that carry the putatively deleterious fs indel alleles  we were not able to test the significance of these phenotypic observations. however, these examples show the practical uses of the proposed methods.

we further studied the bottom  <dig> genes with nms with lowest scores in our dataset. table  <dig> shows that while it is possible to observe nms in essential genes   <cit> , our method predicts that these mutations have no substantial effect on the function. these mutations are located in the c-termini of these genes.

variations in the human population
to test whether our methods can be applied to the variations in the human population we examined genes with fs indels and nms reported in dbsnp  <cit> . we categorized the variations into two classes: variations that have records of diseases association in omim  <cit>  and lsdb  <cit>  and variations with no such records. we expect that the latter class  to contain mutations with less harmful effects.

we then sought to study the allele frequency spectrum of these variations. heterozygousity information was only available for the nms with no disease association. we used the heterozygousity to compute the minor-allele frequency  of the nms that were used in the following maf spectrum analysis. we studied the segregation of nms in the human population by comparing the spectrums of maf of the nms that cause greater information loss  and the nms with lower effects . as for the non-coding indels above, we computed d =  <dig>  as the optimal threshold using the poisson random fields method . we found that the spectrum of maf of nms with higher information loss  is significantly skewed to left  indicating that these variations segregate significantly at lower allele frequencies. thus, these mutations appear to have more deleterious effects in the population.

to study the effects of selection on mutation' density, we compared the observed distribution of scores with that expected if variations were randomly placed. to do so, we computed the score d for a large number of fs indels as well as nms placed randomly on the human genes in our dataset. figures 4c and 4d compare the distribution of these scores for fs indels and nms, respectively, with variations in our dataset divided into two classes: with and without disease associations. the insignificant different between distributions for variations with disease association compared to randomly generated variations  suggests that these variations are distributed randomly throughout human genes. on the other hand, there is a significant difference between the distributions of variations that have no disease association compared to randomly placed variations . similarly, there is also a significant difference between the distributions of variations with and without disease association . the significant abundance of mutations with lower deleterious effects in the data with no disease association, or in other words, the paucity of variations with higher information loss scores, indicates that purifying selection had acted on highly deleterious variations.

an example for the application of the method to study human genes
the abundance of variations in genes associated with diseases as well as a wide range of information loss they cause is overwhelming. as an example, consider the tumor repressor gene p <dig> and its protein product tp <dig>  <cit> . there are  <dig> somatic,  <dig> cell-line and  <dig> germline nms as well as  <dig> somatic,  <dig> cell-line and  <dig> germline fs indels reported to have association with different types of cancer. these mutations have wide ranges of effects on protein conservation . while it is difficult to determine which mutations cause these diseases  <cit> , different effect of these mutations on protein conservation suggests different roles they potentially play in damaging the protein function. for instance,  <dig> nms as well as  <dig> fs indels of these sets with lowest score  are positioned in residues after  <dig> in tp <dig> associated with the exons 9- <dig>  consistent with the prediction that these have little impact on protein function, these regions are not part of the so-called "hot spots" in this protein   <cit> .

discussion
our proposed methods are useful for practical purposes to sort a huge number of fs indels, nms, as well as indels in non-coding dna in terms of their deleterious effect. it is important to note that our methods do not seek to classify variations into deleterious and non-deleterious but rather to rank their effect for further analysis and laboratory experiments.

for the variations in the protein-coding dna, the proposed score is built upon the principle assumption that the effect of nonsense or fs indel mutations on protein can be computed as sum of effects due to individual residues. this is obviously an over-simplification that is widely accepted in statistically modeling the individual columns of an alignment independently. a more complex method that considered correlations between each residue was also implemented using a profile-hmm based on a generative hidden-markov model  <cit>  . the score s were computed as the likelihood of the sequence given the profile-hmm  <cit> . similar prediction results were observed, i.e. sequences with mutations in more conserved regions resulted in lower scores.

we observed a strong correlation between the position of the nonsense or fs mutations and the loss of information they cause . we were not able to demonstrate that the d score outperforms the percentage of the protein that is truncated . when we compare the distribution of the length lost to the random expectation  we find that the length-lost score appears to show less deviation from the random expectation than the d score for the human data . this is consistent with the hypothesis that the d score captures more information than the length lost. while simply considering the number of residues affected provides a reasonable guess at the impact of mutations "on average", there are cases for which the position of the mutation does not reflect its effect on evolutionary conservation . furthermore, we believe that the d score represents a more principled approach to quantifying the importance of these variants because it directly measures evolutionary information, and because it is consistent with previous approaches to quantify the effects of variants, such as sift. however, if multiple sequence alignments are not available, the length lost might also provide a reasonable substitute to quantify the effect of a fs indel or nm.

CONCLUSIONS
identification of causative mutations for diseases remains a challenge even for the case of single genes, let alone in cases where mutations are studied in a network of genes and regulatory elements . due to the overwhelming abundance of variations, the information loss score, that captures the evolutionary conservation context of the sequences harbouring mutations, seems to be a good candidate for weighting variations in large-scale association analyses  <cit> .
