BACKGROUND
biotrophic plant fungal pathogens cause dramatic yield losses in many crop species worldwide. graminaceous powdery mildew and rust diseases are particularly serious because of the extensive cultivation of their hosts, wheat, barley and maize. however, sorghum, rye, oat and a number of forage grasses also commonly suffer from attack by these pathogens. the importance of powdery mildew has motivated pietro spanu, imperial college, uk to release preliminary genome sequence data of the barley powdery mildew fungus  as model organism for this unique group of pathogens at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. in recent years, major outbreaks of wheat stem rust epidemics, caused by a new aggressive fungal isolate , have led to very significant losses in africa  <cit> . this has spurred genome sequencing of the wheat stem rust fungus . see http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/puccinia_graminis.3/home.html.

biotrophic plant pathogens live in intimate contact with their hosts and are dependent on an ability to transfer effector proteins into cells of the host. we define effectors as proteins and other compounds that enhance disease development by targeting host processes, but are otherwise redundant to basal growth processes in the pathogen. a primary role of effectors is to inhibit host defense mechanisms  <cit> . the filamentous powdery mildew and rust fungi, as well as many oomycete pathogens, all develop haustoria within the lumen of the host cell, where they serve to take up nutrients. in parallel with the growth of the haustorium, the host cell generates a membrane of unknown origin, which surrounds the haustorium. many bacterial pathogens use the "type three secretion system"  to inject effectors into plant cells  <cit> . however, it remains unsolved how haustoria-forming fungal pathogens transfer effectors into the host cell, where some of these proteins confer their function. it is known that oomycete effectors are dependent on n-terminal signal peptides for secretion from the haustoria, via the default secretory pathway. furthermore, these effectors carry an amino acid double motif  required for them to cross the plant-derived extrahaustorial membrane . this motif is located a few amino acids downstream of the signal peptide cleavage sites  <cit> . the rxlr-deer double motif has been used to screen genome sequences and allowed identification of approximately  <dig> phytophthora  <cit>  and  <dig> hyaloperonospora effector candidates  <cit> . based on bacterial genome sequences and the t3ss target signal, inventories have been obtained each with a few dozen bacterial effector candidates  <cit> . effector candidates generally are small proteins in their mature form, and they rarely have homologues in more remotely related microbial species  <cit> .

very few effectors and effector candidates have been identified from haustoria-forming fungal pathogens. two effectors have been identified from the barley powdery mildew fungus, bgh  <cit> , and a number of effectors and effector candidates have been identified from rust fungi  <cit> . bgh and other powdery mildew fungi are highly suitable for haustoria est sequencing, since they only attack the above ground plant epidermal cell layer, which allows specific sampling of tissue highly enriched with haustoria. this led us to conduct est sequencing in an attempt to identify new bgh effectors. in the present study, we identified more than  <dig> effector candidate proteins, all sharing a "y/f/wxc"-motif in the n-terminal, downstream of signal peptides. subsequent studies of other pathogen genomes revealed that the wheat stem rust and wheat leaf rust fungi also have large sets of genes encoding proteins of similar structure as the bgh effector candidates.

RESULTS
highly expressed bgh haustorial genes encode novel effector candidates with signal peptides
bgh establishes the first haustorium in the barley leaf epidermal cells from approximately  <dig> hours post inoculation . conidia that fail to generate haustoria die. after day  <dig>  colony formation starts, and during the first week, hyphal growth and formation of new conidia will occur unhindered. secondary haustoria are established from day 2- <dig>  and by the late stage of infection at day 6- <dig>  very large numbers of haustoria are present in the host epidermal cells, as seen in figure  <dig>  aiming to obtain plant tissue with the highest possible content of fungal haustoria, we chose to collect epidermal material at this late stage of infection . surface fungal hyphae and spores were removed prior to tissue sampling. this material was used to generate a cdna library, of which  <dig>  est reads were made. cluster analysis was followed by blast searches against public databases to predict whether the sequences were of fungal or plant origin. this revealed that approximately two-thirds of the ests, representing fungal transcripts expressed in the bgh haustorium, clustered into approximately  <dig>  unigenes. approximately 90% of these were present in the preliminary bgh genome sequence data at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. the cluster analysis showed that the most frequently occurring fungal est sequence appeared  <dig> times. this est contig encodes a 109-amino acid protein, bghefc <dig>  with a predicted n-terminal signal peptide. the 88-amino acid mature protein has no homologues outside b. graminis. we then listed the fungal contigs according to their number of est sequences. interestingly, at the top of the list, where the contigs were assembled from  <dig> to  <dig> ests, approximately 40% of them encoded small, novel proteins with predicted n-terminal signal peptides. using this approach, we initially identified  <dig> contigs with these characteristics, encoding proteins of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . expression analysis of  <dig> transcripts from this group demonstrated that all were expressed predominantly in haustoria . the haustoria expression and the predicted signal peptide allow us to term these  <dig> proteins that are unique to b. graminis, "effector candidates" or bghefc's.

effector candidates share a y/f/wxc-motif
inspired by the rxlr-deer motif required for ehm transfer of oomycete effectors, we searched for a motif downstream of the predicted signal peptide in the  <dig> bgh effector candidate proteins. an alignment of these mature proteins revealed a "y/f/wxc"-amino acid motif within  <dig> amino acids of the predicted signal peptide cleavage sites . in the majority of the proteins , the first amino acid of the motif is tyrosine , to a lesser extent  it is phenylalanine  and in a few cases  it is tryptophan . these three amino acids constitute the group of uncharged aromatic amino acids, which share considerable structural similarity.

we subsequently examined all fungal proteins that could be identified from the est library and found in total  <dig> est clusters and singletons that predominantly encode short , b. graminis-specific proteins that have a predicted n-terminal signal peptide, and importantly have the y/f/wxc-motif within the first  <dig> amino acids of the n-terminal methionine. in all cases, the y/f/wxc-motif is located within  <dig> amino acids downstream from the predicted signal peptide cleavage site. of these  <dig> est clusters and singletons,  <dig> were not full-length. for  <dig> of those, we were able to identify the complete coding sequences by help of the partial bgh genome sequence at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. additional file 1: table s <dig> lists all  <dig> bgh proteins identified using this approach. it appears that the y, f and w at the first position occurred in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the proteins, respectively, that the central amino acid of the y/f/wxc-motif never is cysteine , and that the last amino acid always is c . figure  <dig> illustrates the distribution and nature of the y/f/wxc-motif along the n-terminus of the mature effector candidates. this shows that the motif starts in position  <dig> in  <dig> of these  <dig> proteins, suggesting this to be the optimal position of the motif relative to a protein n-terminus. in most cases  the bgh effector candidates only have one y/f/wxc-motif. however, two and three copies of the motif are present in  <dig> and two of the sequences, respectively . the total number of ests encoding y/f/wxc-effector candidates sums up to  <dig> . this is as much as 19% of all haustorial ests in the library, emphasizing the importance of these proteins for this fungal structure. the  <dig> ests of bghefc <dig> alone constitute  <dig> %.

only three of the proteins encoded by these highly expressed transcripts, bghefc <dig>  bghefc <dig> and bghefc <dig>  were found among  <dig> fungal proteins identified in the haustorial proteome . this suggests that even though many of the  <dig> y/f/wxc-genes are highly expressed, the proteins in general are secreted from the haustoria . furthermore, five short, unknown proteins with signal peptide, found in a proteome study of haustoria-containing epidermal tissue  <cit> , are represented within the  <dig> y/f/wxc-effector candidates . in this study a total of  <dig> bgh proteins were identified  <cit> . the five proteins were not identified within the haustoria proteome  <cit> , suggesting they are secreted.

the bgh y/f/wxc-effector candidates are highly diverse, yet they do share a conserved gene structure
blast searches against the ncbi nr/nt database could not identify homologues outside of b. graminis. when compared to each other, their relationship is also poor. in a multiple alignment of the  <dig> mature proteins, the y/f/wxc-motif aligns in  <dig> of the sequences . no other sequence structure reaches this level of conservation. however, based on shared sequence identity,  <dig> of the  <dig> full-length bgh effector candidates group into  <dig> clusters. the clusters, ranging in size from two to  <dig> proteins, are based on the criteria that all members have at least one blast hit  to another member of the cluster . the remaining  <dig> are singletons which do not have a significant blast hit   to any other of the  <dig> bgh effector candidates. an unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis of these  <dig> protein sequences  supports the existence of small families of proteins.

in order to further address the relationship of the y/f/wxc-genes, we studied their intron structure revealed by comparison of the est sequences and the genomic data available on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. intron position is an ancient conserved genomic character that is highly useful for phylogenetic analyses of genes  <cit> . the study was conducted on the  <dig> genes in which both a full-length est contig and a full-length genomic sequence could be established for the entire open reading frame . fifty-one of these had an intron approximately two-thirds into the coding sequence. closer inspection of these  <dig> y/f/wxc-genes demonstrated that the intron is always positioned between  <dig> to  <dig> nt from the translation start codon . since introns in unrelated genes occur randomly, this narrow window suggests that these  <dig> genes could be related. substantial support for this hypothesis came from the finding that the introns in all  <dig> genes are located in phase  <dig> positions; i.e. between the first and the second nucleotide of a codon. generally, introns can occur in all three phases, but predominantly in phase  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this finding of phase  <dig> positions in 100% of the genes appears to be highly non-random. another character to consider is intron length, which also is highly variable in unrelated genes. meanwhile, these  <dig> introns had lengths only varying from  <dig> to  <dig> nt . forty-five of them occurred in groups, of two or more sequences, with the exact same length varying from  <dig> to  <dig> nt. these results strongly suggest that the genes encoding the y/f/wxc-effector candidates originate from a single ancient gene and that evolution has favored numerous tri-nucleotide insertions and deletions, while preserving the y/f/wxc-coding sequence and the intron.

expression of bgh effector candidates is linked to haustoria formation
the identification of the y/f/wxc-effector candidates in our est library, prompted us to analyze the expression of  <dig> of the most abundant y/f/wxc-effector candidates in different fungal tissues. in order to execute this experiment, we extracted rna from the bgh fungal material at the leaf surface, and from barley epidermal tissue, containing a high density of haustoria. y/f/wxc-effector transcript levels were analyzed in these samples by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. as internal controls, we analyzed the transcript level of bghhistone h <dig> and bghβ-tubulin showing similar expression levels in the two samples. for all effector candidates analyzed, we detected a significantly higher transcript level in haustoria-containing epidermal tissue than in the surface fungal spores and hyphae .

to further characterize y/f/wxc-effector candidates during infection, we conducted a time-course experiment where barley leaves were colonized by bgh for up to  <dig> days. within the first day, limited fungal growth occurs, since this requires functional haustoria which are established within  <dig> day post inoculation . after day  <dig>  colony formation starts, and within the time-course the fungus grows unhindered with many haustoria present in the host epidermal cells by day  <dig> 

to analyze the relative transcript level of the y/f/wxc-effector candidates, we first established bghβ-tubulin as reference gene to monitor the fungal growth in our time-series. this was done by normalizing the bghβ-tubulin transcript levels to the barley hvgapdh transcript expressed in the leaf. within the first day, the bghβ-tubulin transcript did not increase. from day  <dig>  a linear increase in transcript level occurred through-out the time-course . this bghβ-tubulin transcript profile reflects the maturation of the first haustoria between day  <dig> and  <dig>  and the subsequent fungal growth. thus, the bghβ-tubulin transcript can be used for normalizing gene expression in the fungus during infection. we then selected to analyze the transcripts of the three y/f/wxc-effector candidates for which the highest number of ests occurred. qpcr analysis showed that the bghefc <dig> and bghefc <dig> transcript levels gradually increased relative to the β-tubulin transcript between day  <dig> and day 4- <dig> . thereafter, bghefc <dig> and bghefc <dig> transcript levels declined. the bghefc <dig> transcript showed a different profile, with a slow but gradually increasing level through-out the time-course . all together, the results indicate that these y/f/wxc-effector candidates are expressed in haustoria predominantly during late stages of infection.

y/f/wxc-proteins in rust fungi
the discovery of y/f/wxc-effector candidates in bgh prompted us to search the genome data of the serious wheat stem rust pathogen, pgt, another haustoria-forming biotrophic fungus attacking members of the grass family, gramineae. using the pgt genome, it was possible to analyze whether the general occurrence of the y/f/wxc-motif is random. in the  <dig>  pgt encoded proteins, y, f, w and c occur at frequencies of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. in an unbiased distribution, the y/f/wxc-motif should occur once every  <dig> amino acid. however, the motif occurs on average every  <dig> amino acids, suggesting positive selection for the y/f/wxc-motif in the pgt proteins. further analysis revealed that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  pgt encoded proteins have a signal peptide. we then turned to study the n-termini of the mature forms of these  <dig>  proteins . in these  <dig>  n-termini, the y/f/wxc-motif occurred on average once every  <dig> amino acids. this led to the identification of  <dig> y/f/wxc-proteins, in all of which the y/f/wxc-motif occurs within the first  <dig> amino acids from the signal peptide cleavage site .

we then analyzed how these  <dig> pgt y/f/wxc-proteins were size-wise distributed relative to all the  <dig>  proteins with a signal peptide. as shown in figure 6a, there is a striking over-representation of these y/f/wxc-proteins within the smaller proteins. twenty percent of the proteins between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids long are y/f/wxc-proteins, while this number is  <dig> % for the rest of the proteins.

blast searches against the ncbi nr/nt database revealed that 94% of these  <dig> pgt sequences had no homologues outside of puccinia. seventy-eight of these sequences do not have a significant blast hit  to any other of the  <dig> pgt y/f/wxc-protein . however, the remaining  <dig> pgt proteins group into  <dig> clusters, ranging from two to  <dig> proteins  . accordingly, most of these  <dig> pgt y/f/wxc-proteins have the same sequence characteristics as the  <dig> bgh effector candidates, namely that they have signal peptides, they have the y/f/wxc-motif, they are short, and they are found to be unique to puccinia .

compared to three other fungi that do not form haustoria, ustilago maydis, podospora anserina and magnaporthe grisea, and the oomycete phytophthora infestans that does form haustoria, there was an obvious over-representation of genes encoding this effector candidate-type proteins in pgt. this is clear when plotting the number of all proteins with signal peptide, and a y/f/wxc-motif within  <dig> amino acids from the n-terminal methionine, cumulatively against their length . in addition, this result demonstrated that the other four pathogens do not encode high numbers of y/f/wxc-proteins. the bgh effector candidates  were also plotted in figure 6b, and showed a distribution very similar to the signal peptide-y/f/wxc-proteins from pgt. furthermore, the other fungi investigated had low numbers of this kind of protein, and in summary, we suggest that the wheat stem rust fungus has a collection of proteins with characteristics similar to that of the powdery mildew y/f/wxc-effector candidates.

an est library of p. triticina , another wheat pathogen that causes leaf rust, was searched for presence of y/f/wxc-effector candidate-type proteins. using the same criteria as for bgh and pgt, we managed to identify  <dig> such proteins from pt, ranging from 59- <dig> amino acids in length . blast searches against the ncbi nr/nt database identified no homologues . using the criteria that all members of a cluster must have at least one blast hit  to another member,  <dig> of these proteins group into  <dig> clusters, ranging from two to  <dig> proteins . the remaining  <dig> proteins do not have a significant blast hit  to any other of the  <dig> pt y/f/wxc-protein . the  <dig> pt y/f/wxc-proteins are also plotted in figure 6b, which reveals a length vs. number distribution similar to those from bgh and pgt. like the wheat stem rust fungus, the wheat leaf rust fungus also appears to have a collection of proteins with the same characteristics as the powdery mildew y/f/wxc-effector candidates .

y/f/wxc-effector candidates are shared between closely related pathogens
effectors proteins are predicted to have evolved in response to appearance of new defense pathways in the host plant, and therefore it is interesting to examine how ancient these effectors are. whether or not the y/f/wxc-effector candidate-type proteins are shared between pathogens might shed some light on this issue. although there is no sequence similarity of y/f/wxc-effector candidates between powdery mildew and rust pathogens , homologues within powdery mildew and rust fungi can be identified.

while no genome sequence data can be found for other b. graminis powdery mildew fungi, there are est libraries available from leaves that were inoculated with these pathogens. blast searching primarily the "est_others" database on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> bgh y/f/wxc-effector candidates shared homology  to proteins encoded by est sequences generated from powdery mildew-infected wheat . these blast analyses resulted in  <dig> b. graminis f.sp. tritici  ests, and in all cases, where the sequence was complete at the n-terminal , these ests encoded unique proteins with a predicted n-terminal signal peptide and a y/f/wxc-motif. a high level of conservation of the amino acids in the y/f/wxc-motif between the bgh and bgt homologues was observed. ten of the homologous pairs shared all three amino acids of the motif. of the remaining pairs,  <dig> shared the amino acid at the "y/f/w" and "c" position, while two only shared the "c". in those cases where the bgt sequences were complete at the n and c-terminal, their lengths ranged from 73- <dig> amino acids.

even though pgt and pt both are rust pathogens on wheat, they have rather different life-styles, and they are predicted to be more distantly related than bgh and bgt. still, we were able to find conserved y/f/wxc-proteins between pgt and pt . in fact, there are two groups of conserved proteins between the pgt and pt y/f/wxc-effector candidates. in group  <dig>  consisting of two pt sequences  and four pgt sequences , the y/f/wxc-motif "fgc" is completely conserved. in this group the highest e-value was 7e- <dig>  however, in group  <dig>  the three pt sequences  have "ftc", whereas the pgt sequence  has a "ytc".

furthermore, through blast searches against est sequences in the currently available databases, we have identified homologues  of the pgt and pt y/f/wxc-effector candidates in a third rust species which infects wheat, the stripe rust fungus, puccinia striiformis . ten of the pgt y/f/wxc-effector candidates shared homologies with seven y/f/wxc-proteins encoded by ps ests. one of the ps y/f/wxc-proteins belong the pgt/pt group  <dig> above .

discussion
our discovery of the n-terminal y/f/wxc-motif within a specific position of secreted proteins only from haustoria-forming fungi attacking gramineae represents the first potential molecular "landmark", specific for this group of pathogens. we propose that the y/f/wxc-proteins serve effector functions, essential for haustoria-forming fungi. this is supported by the fact that 19% of the bgh haustorial transcriptome encode this type of proteins. furthermore, the finding of conserved bgh y/f/wxc-gene structure, including intron position and size, contributes to establishing the bgh y/f/wxc-effector candidates as a protein super-family.

initially,  <dig> bgh y/f/wxc-proteins were discovered from our haustoria est-library. a bioinformatics approach was subsequently taken to define a further  <dig> and  <dig> proteins, with comparable sequence characteristics to the bgh y/f/wxc-effector candidates, from pgt and pt, respectively. we have evidence from blast searches of genomic sequence data on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov that more than the  <dig> bgh genes encoding y/f/wxc-effector candidate can be found . in comparison, the pgt y/f/wxc-proteins are genome-based, and therefore expected to include all of the y/f/wxc-proteins for this pathogen; although it is important to note that automatic gene annotation is often less precise for small genes. meanwhile, the  <dig> pt sequences are from an est-library of only approximately  <dig>  clones. as such, this collection is only expected to include a subset of the y/f/wxc-sequences in this rust pathogen. these numbers of largely dissimilar proteins are reminiscent of the numbers of rxlr-deer proteins identified in oomycetes  <cit> . the finding of y/f/wxc-proteins in both powdery mildew and rust fungi raises the question whether the y/f/wxc-motif have a common origin. these fungi have specialized within ascomycota and basidiomycota, respectively, most likely reflecting that the y/f/wxc-motif has evolved convergently in these two fungal phyla. furthermore, the fact that the y/f/wxc-proteins within individual pathogens are highly diverse could suggest that the motif has evolved multiple times. on the other hand, there is a striking similarity in the intron positions in most of the y/f/wxc-genes in bgh, despite the sequence dissimilarity, which points towards the existence of a common gene ancestor. to this end, it is relevant to stress that homologous y/f/wxc-proteins could be found between different b. graminis powdery mildew pathogens and between different puccinia rust pathogens. this provides additional support for the notion that some of the y/f/wxc-proteins are ancient and have evolved before separation occurred within these two types of pathogens.

moreover, the highly diverse nature of both the powdery mildew and rust y/f/wxc-proteins suggests that many different targets exist in their host plants. this agrees with the fact that the regulation of defense is controlled by a highly complex signaling network  <cit> , in which a large number of relevant targets can be envisioned. when these signaling elements evolved during plant evolution, new pathogen effectors may have coevolved. similar dramatic impacts are believed to have driven other gene amplifications and diversifications resulting in superfamilies with conserved intron-exon structures, but poor sequence similarities  <cit> . generally, the y/f/wxc-effector candidates identified are short and unique to their class of pathogen, suggesting that they are unlikely to have enzymatic activity, but rather interact with host defense components to manipulate their activity.

the highly conserved nature of the bgh y/f/wxc-motif leads us to speculate that it is involved in a common mechanism shared by the y/f/wxc-effector candidates. the n-terminal rxlr-deer double-motif in haustoria forming oomycete plant pathogens has been documented to confer transfer across the ehm  <cit> , a function required by some haustoria secreted effectors. while it is tempting to envisage a similar function for the y/f/wxc-motif, further studies investigating the y/f/wxc-function are required. bioinformatic analyzes of all the powdery mildew and rust y/f/wxc-proteins have not revealed consistent evidence for other conserved amino acid sequence patterns surrounding the y/f/wxc-motif.

the importance of the y/f/wxc-motif, is supported by its presence in several powdery mildew and rust fungi. in bgh, it most frequently occurs at amino acid  <dig> of the mature protein. such a position is albeit less pronounced in the rust fungi. on the other hand, the rust y/f/wxc-effector candidates often have more y/f/wxc-copies. the preferred first amino acid of the motif is the aromatic amino acid tyrosine  in bgh. interestingly, the aromatic phenylalanine  is the first amino acid in the motif in rust fungi. this could indicate that yxc and fxc serve separate purposes. however, this is most likely not the case, since there are examples where closely related proteins have yxc and fxc, respectively. this was seen for seven homologues of bgh proteins in bgt  and for homologues of one pgt proteins in pt. tryptophan  occurs rarely as the first amino acid in all four fungi, suggesting that this aromatic amino acid is less desirable. it is noteworthy that we do not find that histidine can take the first position. histidine is non-aromatic, but space-wise similar to phenylalanine and tyrosine. at the same time histidine is quite similar to tryptophan without the aromatic group. this underlines that the aromatic group appears to be essential the function of the motif.

we predict that some of the y/f/wxc-proteins suppress defense manifested in the host cell when haustoria actively mobilize nutrients to the fungal structures outside the host cell. there are evidences in the literature that the defense mechanisms are suppressed in host cells containing haustoria. this is obvious from microscopy of certain types of multicellular hypersensitive response  lesions in barley attacked by bgh. while neighboring epidermal and mesophyll cells undergo hr in such cases, epidermal cells containing haustoria often evade this defense response  <cit> . this suppression of defense has also been visualized in double inoculation experiments. when a spore from a first inoculation with a virulent bgh genotype establishes a haustorium, then the epidermal cell that contains it looses its ability to exhibit penetration resistance and hr in response to later attacks  <cit> .

the y/f/wxc-type effector candidates are in several ways distinct from the previously identified avrk <dig> and the related avra <dig> effectors also expressed by bgh  <cit> . no sequence similarity could be found between avrk <dig> and any of the y/f/wxc-type effector candidates. in addition, there are indications that avrk <dig> homologues and genes for y/f/wxc-type effector candidates are expressed dissimilarly. y/f/wxc-type effector candidate genes are primarily expressed days after inoculation and primarily in haustoria . only a single est corresponding to a y/f/wxc-effector candidates could be identified in publically available bgh est libraries of  <dig>  clones from germinated and ungerminated conidia  <cit>  and of ~ <dig> clones from leaf surface hyphae . on the other hand, no avrk <dig> homologous transcripts were identified among the more than  <dig>  bgh ests in our haustoria library from  <dig> dpi. even though avrk <dig> and avra <dig> have been demonstrated to confer their function in the host cytoplasm  <cit>  it remains unknown how they are transferred from the fungus to the plant cells. they do not have classical signal peptides or other recognizable elements that can be involved in conferring such a transfer. a possible background for the distinct features of these proteins can be that the avrk <dig> homologues are secreted from the penetration hyphae and early haustorial structures in accordance with the observation that they suppress penetration resistance in barley  <cit> . meanwhile, the y/f/wxc-type effector candidates appear to be secreted from mature haustoria.

our bioinformatics analysis of the pgt proteome indicated presence of large numbers of small secreted proteins besides those having the y/f/wxc-motif . with very few exceptions, these proteins have no annotated homologues . we would therefore not be surprised if also they will turn out to be effectors. rust fungi endure a significant part of their life in the intercellular space in the host tissue, and it can be envisioned that they need a much wider palette of effectors. powdery mildew fungi to a large extent live outside the leaf with less direct contact to the plant tissue, and despite our finding of many effector candidates, they could be few relative to rust effectors.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest the y/f/wxc-proteins are a new class of effectors, highly expressed in haustoria of powdery mildew fungi. the y/f/wxc-motif is predicted to serve a general and essential function, possibly in transfer of the effector proteins across the ehm. in addition, more than  <dig> small, y/f/wxc-proteins with signal peptides were identified from rust fungi infecting gramineae. since rust and powdery mildew fungi both are specialized forms within basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, respectively, it is conceivable that the y/f/wxc-motif has evolved convergently in these two types of pathogens. despite poor sequence identity between these y/f/wxc-proteins, the encoding genes in bgh have a conserved exon-intron structure, pointing towards a single gene-origin within the powdery mildew fungi. this provides further support for these proteins to have related and crucial roles for the biotrophic lifestyle.
