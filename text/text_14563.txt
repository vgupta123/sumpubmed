BACKGROUND
lpch population and habitat declines
the lpch is a prairie grouse found in upland shrubland and grassland habitats of the great plains. except for the gunnison's sage-grouse , the lpch has the most restricted distribution and smallest population size of any native north american grouse species. distribution has declined by over 90% since the 1800s  <cit> . significant reductions in population size and distribution during that time have been attributed to excessive grazing of rangelands, conversion of native rangelands to croplands, drought, and chemical control of sand sagebrush  and shin-oak . as a consequence, populations are now fragmented across its range  <cit> .

status and conservation efforts
the us fish and wildlife service classifies the lpch as a candidate for protection under the endangered species act. in january  <dig>  representatives of state and federal agencies, ranchers, the oil and gas industry, and conservation organizations formed a working group to create a conservation strategy for two candidate species, the lpch and sand dune lizard  in shinnery oak and sandsage grassland communities in new mexico. we follow terminology in peterson and boyd  <cit> , where the term "sand shinnery" refers to the dunal vegetation community dominated by "shin-oak" shrubs, quercus havardii.

the working group participated in a series of strategic planning meetings over a two-year period and produced a planning document in august  <dig>  <cit> . for the creation and implementation of the strategy, it was essential to understand the distribution of occupied, suitable, restorable, and unsuitable lpch habitat. the working group requested some habitat analyses for conservation planning; others grew from our questions and ideas. here we report on the habitat analyses we performed and their implications for lpch conservation.

habitat analysis needs and objectives
the lpch occurs in habitats dominated by shin-oak or sand sagebrush with tall grass or mixed-grass species, in five states within the southern shortgrass prairie ecoregion  <cit> : southeastern colorado, southwestern kansas, western oklahoma, eastern new mexico, and the texas panhandle and portions of texas contiguous with the new mexico range . this study focuses on occupied habitats in new mexico.

lpch typically nest on the ground under sand sagebrush or shin-oak shrubs, or in residual bunchgrasses   <cit> . predation is the primary cause of nest failure. nest depredation and abandonment rates and adult survivorship have been associated with vegetation height, cover, and density  <cit> . although residual tall grass appears important for nesting cover, lpch hens prefer to nest in pastures containing a mixture of grass and shin-oak over pastures in which shrubs have been eliminated  <cit> . lpch in new mexico prefer shin-oak for brood rearing, due to the cover, acorns, and abundant insects it provides  <cit> . although limited use of herbicides is sometimes recommended to achieve a balance of shin-oak and grass, large-scale conversion of shin-oak/grass communities to grasslands is considered detrimental  <cit> .

the minimum habitat patch size required to support lpch is unclear, but research has focused on two patch sizes: ~ <dig>  ha and ~ <dig>  ha . taylor and guthery  <cit>  proposed an area of suitable habitat with radius of  <dig>  km centered around a lek  as the minimum patch size for maintenance of a "lek population," because 90% of activity occurred within this limit. this distance was consistent with earlier studies  <cit> . giesen  <cit>  found that the mean distance from lek of capture to nest site was  <dig>  km . although pitman et al.  <cit>  found some nests located further from the capture lek, for most years mean distances were consistent with those listed above. thus, a  <dig>  km radius can be considered an estimate of the minimum breeding-season patch size around a lek site needed by the majority of lpch hens attending that lek.

in addition, taylor and guthery  <cit>  proposed  <dig> km <dig> as the optimum patch size needed for maintaining healthy lpch populations, based on the observation that virtually all detections of lpch were within  <dig>  km  of the display ground. this observation was corroborated by giesen  <cit> . the  <dig> mi/ <dig>  ha patch size was subsequently used by woodward, fuhlendorf and co-authors, who found that landscapes in which lpch populations declined were characterized by greater rates of landscape change and greater rates of shrub loss within  <dig>  km of leks than landscapes in which populations did not decline  <cit> . an investigation of the scale-dependent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on lpch populations found that general landscape changes, amount of cropland, and number of trees impacted lpch populations at the  <dig>  km  scale  <cit> .

both of these frequently cited patch sizes have biological significance, but both are based on distances smaller than observed dispersal distances . thus, they represent only minimum requirements, and conservation planning based on even the  <dig>  ha patch size will not guarantee lpch population stability. the analyses we performed using these two patch sizes should therefore be considered useful primarily to identify areas where minimum-sized patches of suitable lpch habitat remain.

fragmentation and conversion of sandhill landscapes have occurred throughout eastern new mexico. mechanisms that fragment the landscape are scale-dependent  <cit>  and differentially impact lpch populations at local and regional scales. in one study, regional scale  landscape impacts included conversions to cropland and tree encroachment. changes in edge density and largest patch size were important variables at small spatial scales   <cit> . braun et al.  <cit>  suggested that the short dispersal distances and specialized food habits of grouse may make them relatively intolerant of extensive habitat fragmentation.

to manage for conservation of lpch, it is necessary to understand the abundance and distribution of suitable habitat on the scales at which management action occurs. for example, individual ranchers participating in habitat conservation agreements and nm department of game biologists managing fish prairie-chicken conservation areas operate locally. regional managers include federal agencies such as the blm. the purpose of this project was to perform gis analyses of lpch habitat in the study area. objectives were to identify and quantify:  <dig>  suitable habitat,  <dig>  conversion of native habitats,  <dig>  potential for habitat restoration, and  <dig>  unsuitable habitat available for oil and gas activities.

RESULTS
land conversion
to identify herbicide-treated areas, we used the normalized differential vegetation index  image in conjunction with blm environmental assessment decision documents indicating the boundaries of areas treated with herbicide from  <dig> to  <dig> . the land conversion analysis revealed that  <dig>  ha  were treated with herbicides, which converted shrubland to grassland vegetation types. based on the ndvi, we classified  <dig>   additional hectares as potentially treated. we classified  <dig>  ha  as converted to agriculture, and  <dig>  ha  as unknown conversion . the total area apparently converted from native vegetation types was  <dig>  ha, 17% of the study area.

considering all categories of land conversions, private lands accounted for 60% and blm lands 32%. the majority of agricultural conversions occurred on private lands, while most herbicide treatments occurred on blm rangelands, . potentially treated areas were also found primarily on blm lands, with smaller areas on private and state land. unknown conversions occurred primarily on private land . based on known land use nearby, these unknown areas probably represent mainly agricultural conversion.

habitat suitability and patch size
we found  <dig>  ha of group a habitats, suitable habitats dominated by shin-oak or sand sagebrush , covering 41% of the study area. habitats defined as seasonal use or transitional areas  covered  <dig>  ha  and included mixed grasses with some shin oak . most of the potential restoration habitat  occurred in the south, and unsuitable habitat  occurred throughout the study area.

group a – occupied and suitable, group b – seasonal and transitional use, group c – potential restoration areas. areas calculated using erdas imagine.

the analysis revealed  <dig>  ha of group a map units  distributed in  <dig> patches of at least  <dig>  ha . we found  <dig>  ha  distributed in only four patches over  <dig>  ha. the largest patches were contained in two areas, one of which is south of us  <dig> in the sparse and scattered population area  <cit>  and outside the ppa designated by the working group. all other patches of group a mus were smaller than  <dig>  ha, comprising a total of  <dig>  ha. thus, 74% of "suitable" lpch habitat occurred in patches too small to support lpch, as defined by current literature, leaving only 26% of suitable habitat and 11% of the study area suitable for lpch. patches of at least  <dig>  ha occurred primarily on private land , followed by blm  and state  land. patches of over  <dig>  ha also occurred primarily on private land , followed by blm , and state  land.

the analysis revealed  <dig>  ha  of the highest-quality habitat  distributed in patches of  <dig>  ha or larger . blm manages the majority of these large, high-quality habitat patches , followed by private landowners  and the state . although the high-quality patches are smaller in size than the optimal patch size of  <dig>  ha suggested by several authors  <cit> , they offer opportunity for habitat improvement through expansion of patch size. we therefore chose to use the smaller patch size in our analysis, to include substantial areas of moderately sized patches of the best lpch habitat.

restoration habitat
we identified  <dig>  ha  of habitats with reasonable restoration potential . habitats with the highest restoration potential occur primarily in the southern portion of the study area, with little restoration habitat in the central portion. the largest share of restoration habitats occurs on blm land . the restoration habitats on blm lands in the south are largely due to honey mesquite invasions into shin-oak habitats, while restoration areas in the north would require re-introduction of shin-oak into areas where it has been destroyed. eighty-one percent of potential restoration areas would require removal of honey mesquite in shin-oak habitats.

ppa analysis/oil and gas development
we performed separate gis analyses to map occupied, suitable, potentially suitable, and unsuitable habitat types within the ppa and to determine how conservation actions might impact the oil and gas activities . the ppa is a  <dig>  ha area defined by the working group in n lea, s roosevelt, and ne chaves counties that contains the highest concentrations of lpch in nm. the analysis revealed  <dig>  ha of occupied habitat  and  <dig>  ha of suitable habitat . within the ppa,  <dig>  ha  were deemed potentially suitable and  <dig>  ha  were unsuitable lpch habitat. using this analysis, industry representatives were able to evaluate proposed strategies for restrictions on new mineral leasing on the ppa.

future analyses
gis habitat analyses will be instrumental to implementing conservation actions such as mesquite reduction or eradication on rangelands or limited use of herbicides to achieve vegetation standards for quality habitat. herbicide use is recommended only in small blocks, away from dune areas, and over  <dig>  miles away from active lek sites. restoration priorities must consider connectivity, proximity, and patch size. ongoing gis analyses will be necessary to identify sites that meet these and other recommendations of the conservation plan.

discussion
map units
the map has twenty-one mus . because of the focus on lpch habitat needs, some mapping units  appear "lumped" and others "split," relative to more standard vegetation classification systems. for example, mu  <dig>  shin-oak-mixed mid-grass and tall-grass duneland, and mu  <dig>  shin-oak- mixed mid-grass and tall-grass shrubland, have similar species composition. the primary difference between these two mus is topographical rather than vegetative. we define these separately for several reasons. first, sdls occur in dunes  <cit> ; thus, differentiation of dune areas is potentially useful for sdl management. second, lpch have been reported to preferentially nest in dunes  <cit> . finally, several previous vegetation classifications of the sand shinnery community have differentiated dunes from areas lacking dunes .

the map also differentiates habitats that differ in overall vegetation cover and shrub versus grass density. nest success has been shown to correlate with height, density, and abundance of residual grasses, especially bluestem , near nests  <cit> . brood foraging sites have been described as having taller shrubs, greater canopy cover, and greater shrub density than surrounding areas  <cit> . thus, it is useful to differentiate habitats that differ in overall vegetation cover and shrub versus grass density. mus designated as "sparse"  contain lower grass cover than corresponding mus not so designated.

in contrast, mus  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  each contain several grassland associations that might be grouped differently using a more traditional vegetation mapping methodology such as the international terrestrial ecological systems classification  <cit> , a mid-scale classification system, or the hierarchical, community-scale approach of the us national vegetation classification  <cit> . because none of the plant associations individually contained in mus  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> constitutes preferred habitat for lpch, the map combines structurally similar but compositionally different grassland associations. structural components rather than affinity to specific species dictate the use of these grasslands by lpch.

land conversion
pasture-scale treatment with the herbicide tebuthiuron occurred on public lands in the study area from the 1980s until the early 1990s and is still occurring on private lands. treated areas contain substantially lower shin-oak cover than untreated areas and were therefore relevant to the mapping effort  <cit> . twenty years after treatment, the ndvi showed that areas known  to be treated still differed markedly in shrub composition from untreated areas. persistence of the effects of treatment provides further rationale for distinguishing shrub-dominated from grass-dominated habitats.

the effects of treatment varied with timing of treatment, quantity of herbicide used, and subsequent management practices. thus, identifiable digital signatures representative of all treatment areas were not evident on the imagery, and treatment areas were not readily seen in the initial map. we therefore created a separate layer of the treatment areas . over half of the existing tall-grass grassland  and 47% of the mid-grass grassland resulted from herbicide treatments. our analyses demonstrate that 17% of the study area has been converted by human activities from native vegetation types into agricultural fields, shrub-free grasslands, or other types of disturbance. only 5% of the study site shows good potential for restoration. this layer will be useful for analyses of the effects of herbicide treatment on habitats of lpch, sdl, and other wildlife.

habitat suitability, patch size, and restoration
within the mapped area, only three areas contain large patches of suitable habitat, and one of those is south of us highway  <dig>  where lpch populations are sparse and scattered . the gis analyses also indicate that most high-quality habitat occurs in patches smaller than  <dig>  ha , rendering them by most definitions below the minimum size required by lpch.

the presence of infrastructure that either kills or at least deters lpch arguably alters habitat quality  <cit> , but it is not immediately obvious if and how patch size requirements are expected to vary with infrastructure density. our analyses are concerned with minimum patch sizes of suitable habitat; increasing infrastructure density would change suitability. because lpch are known to avoid infrastructure  <cit> , we would expect them to move longer distances in habitat with more infrastructure, in an attempt to find infrastructure-free patches. this is apparently the case in oklahoma  <cit> . at some point, however, it would become unprofitable to disperse further and birds should settle for some infrastructure, which they appear to do in oklahoma, possibly altering life history patterns to compensate for the impacts of the infrastructure on survivorship.

honey mesquite has been invading parts of the southwest for decades, likely due to livestock grazing practices  <cit> . honey mesquite mus would require major restoration efforts focused on honey mesquite removal. in contrast, group c restoration habitats in the north  include primarily honey mesquite-shin-oak/short grass shrubland and treated mixed mid-grass and tall-grass grassland, any of which should be easier to restore to suitable vegetation types through shin-oak introduction.

ppa analysis/oil and gas development
nesting and non-nesting lpch have been shown to avoid structures associated with oil and gas activity, such as wellheads, roads, and electric transmission lines  <cit> . the working group was therefore interested in excluding oil and gas activities from suitable and restorable lpch habitat. excluding the areas of occupied, suitable, and potentially suitable habitats available for lpch in the ppa, the gis analyses revealed at least  <dig>  ha of unsuitable habitat with low restoration potential, where the working group could consider allowing oil and gas activities to occur. the potential for identifying areas where human impacts on sensitive species habitats will be lowest is one of the most useful contributions of these analyses.

note, however, that the amount of "suitable" and "unsuitable" habitat depends on how those categories are defined. the habitat quality analysis for the entire study area included only large patches of the most suitable mus and, as a result, it identified only  <dig>  ha of high-quality habitat in the entire study area . because so few large habitat patches exist, to increase the area of suitable habitat, smaller and lower-quality habitat patches would need to be protected and restored, especially in the ppa where the majority of lpch occur. the working group determined that management should be based on a more liberal definition of lpch habitat. for the ppa/oil and gas analysis, lpch habitat was defined to include more vegetation types, smaller patch sizes, and unsuitable vegetation types near active leks. as a result, the ppa analysis performed for conservation planning identified  <dig>  ha  as occupied, suitable, or potentially suitable habitats where oil and gas development should be excluded.

CONCLUSIONS
a detailed habitat map at a scale of 1: <dig> , together with gis analyses requested by the lesser prairie-chicken/sand dune lizard working group, provided:  <dig>  insight into the area, distribution, and quality of available habitat for the lpch,  <dig>  information for stakeholder negotiations, and  <dig>  the basis for creation and implementation of a conservation strategy for the two species.

although suitable lpch habitat appears at first glance to be abundant in southeastern new mexico, consideration of plant community type and patch size revealed that only 26% of the study area was covered in large patches of suitable vegetation types. given the scarcity of habitats with potential to contribute to the species' recovery, it is important to focus the inevitable human impacts in areas of unsuitable habitat and to restore degraded vegetation and small patches of suitable vegetation types. restoration efforts could be focused in two habitat types. in the north, shin-oak could be re-introduced into herbicide-treated areas. in the south, mesquite could be removed from areas where it has encroached.

used in combination with gis analysis and current lpch population data, the map represents a powerful management tool. having participated in the working group, we find it difficult to imagine how such a stakeholder process could be productive without reliance on similar habitat analyses.
