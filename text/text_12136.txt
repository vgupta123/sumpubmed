BACKGROUND
synemin belongs to the intermediate filament  protein family  <cit> . in mammals, the synemin gene is one of the rare if genes encoding three isoforms  achieved by alternative mrna splicing, exon skipping and a shift in the open reading frame  <cit> . the two larger isoforms of synemin  harbor extended c-terminal tails that project from the surface of the filament and provide connecting arms that associate with neighboring proteins  <cit> . in contrast, the small isoform  lacks this tail domain  <cit> .

synemin forms obligatory heteropolymers in order to incorporate into filamentous networks and is associated with desmin and vimentin in muscle and endothelial cells  <cit> . it has been suggested that synemin could function as a linker between different cytoskeletal components based on the fact that it interacts with several proteins involved in the organization of the costameres, neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions within striated muscle cells. these proteins include α-actinin, vinculin, dystrophin, α-dystrobrevin, utrophin, zyxin and talin  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that synemin is an a-kinase anchoring protein , containing a binding region for protein kinase a  in its c-terminal domain which provides temporal and spatial targeting of pka in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . in the nervous system, synemin was found to associate with ruffled membranes of reactive astrocytes and to also co-localize with α-actinin, suggesting a role in cell motility  <cit> . we have shown that synemins h and m were present with vimentin, nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein  in glial progenitors, whereas the small isoform appeared in neurons linked to the nf proteins associated with the membrane compartment  <cit> .

the different expression of isoforms h, m and l of synemin in the nervous system raises several questions about the regulation of synemin gene expression during the determination of glial and neuronal cell lineages in the central and the peripheral nervous system . first, an unexpected finding is the selective synthesis of two high molecular weight synemin isoforms  in cns astrocytes, while the smallest synemin isoform  is present only in neurons  <cit> . this selectivity suggests that the commitment of cns precursor cells to form glia or neuron involves the direct regulation of the single synemin gene. our analysis of mouse development from embryonic day  <dig> to  <dig>  has demonstrated that synemin m mrna is produced at e <dig> as early as nestin and vimentin mrna, prior to the appearance of the h isoform. in toto hybridization at e <dig>  showed synemin m labeling in the embryonic mesoderm and the neuroectoderm  <cit> . we asked if synemin is also expressed in mouse embryonic stem  cells, which can differentiate into a variety of somatic cell types including lineages from three embryonic germ layers? the presence and function of if proteins in es cells are not yet fully understood, only a few members of this family have been studied  <cit> . the mrnas coding for keratins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are present in the 2-cell stage embryo, but only k <dig> and k <dig>  are translated into protein in 4- to 8-cell stage embryos at a low level, which is deposited in aggregates  <cit> . the k <dig> and k <dig> proteins were identified from e <dig>  mouse embryo  <cit> . after differentiation of es cells into neuronal progenitors, k <dig> and k <dig> protein expression decreased  <cit> . the nuclear if protein lamin b <dig> and b <dig> were identified as markers of es cells; however the lamins a/c were activated during es cell differentiation  <cit> .

in this report, we examined the expression profile of synemin isoforms in mouse pluripotent es cells and during their early neural differentiation induced by retinoic acid to answer the following questions: 1) are synemin isoforms expressed in pluripotent es cells? 2) how are synemin isoforms expressed during neural differentiation of es cells? we detected the expression of synemin m at both mrna and protein levels in pluripotent es cells, as early as oct-3/ <dig> and keratin  <dig>  synemin h was produced only in neural precursors when the neural differentiation started, along with synemin m, nestin and gfap.

RESULTS
synemin m expression in mouse pluripotent es cells
to investigate which synemin isoforms are expressed in es cells, two mouse es cell lines were used. we first analyzed the pluripotent state of the cells by pcr-array. we identified the expression of transcription factors maintaining "stem-ness" as nanog, nr6a <dig>  utf <dig>  pou5f <dig> , and signaling molecules required for pluripotency and self-renewal genes such as ifitm <dig> and pten. no expression of embryonic stem cell differentiation genes was detected in the es cells . expression of synemin mrna in es cells was analyzed by rt-pcr. as shown in figure 1a, we detected the synemin m mrna in es cells. in contrast, neither synemin h nor nestin mrna was found. the e <dig>  mouse embryos containing synemin m and h were used as a positive control .

the presence of synemin m protein, but not synemin h, was confirmed by western blot analysis in es cells . in the positive control, both synemin m and h isoforms were identified in the adult mouse bladder. the presence of oct-3/ <dig>  a marker of the pluripotency of es cells, was also confirmed by western blotting . two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  followed by western blotting was used to further analyze the synemin profile from es cells extracts. this experiment showed two spot trains  of synemin m with an apparent molecular weight of 148- <dig> kda and isoelectric point   <dig> - <dig>  in each es cell line , corresponding to its theoretical pi , in agreement with its high content in glutamic acid and glutamine , aspartic acid , and rich in serine  and poor in cysteine . we could observe that the quantity of spot train-a of synemin m was more abundant than spot train-b. in order to investigate the possible post-translational modifications of synemin, we analyzed the phosphorylation of synemin m in es cells with anti-phosphoserine antibody. this result revealed that synemin m was phosphorylated in serine with isoelectric variants .

to determine the synemin localization in es cells, we performed double immunofluorescence staining utilizing synemin, oct-3/ <dig>  cytokeratin  <dig> , and ssea- <dig> antibodies. in order to study specifically the expression of the synemin h isoform, we produced a polyclonal antibody with a polypeptide corresponding to the exon 4a of human synemin, a specific fragment for synemin h  <cit> . western blotting analysis with proteins extracted from the mouse bladder showed that this antibody recognized specifically one band of  <dig> kda, corresponding to the synemin h isoform . the immunocytochemistry study clearly showed the presence of the synemin m protein in pluripotent es cells expressing oct-3/ <dig>  and k <dig> . however, synemin h was never detected in undifferentiated es cells  expressing the pluripotent es marker such as ssea- <dig> . it is remarkable that neither synemin nor keratin was organized in filamentous if networks in pluripotent es cells due to the absence of their partners.

change of synemin expression profile during neural differentiation of es cells
since synemin isoform expression during the mouse embryo development is complex  <cit> , we decided to study the possible change of synemin isoform expression profile during es cell neural differentiation. to achieve this, cultured embryoid bodies  were treated with retinoic acid , an inducer of neural differentiation  <cit> . the characteristics of differentiated es cells were then analyzed by rt-pcr, western blotting and immunochemistry. the expression of synemin h mrna as well as synemin l mrna was detected in differentiated es cells along with synemin m, nestin, a specific marker of neural precursor cells  <cit> , and gfap, a specific marker of the glial cell lineage  <cit>  . however, the accumulation of synemin h mrna was less abundant than synemin m . the appearance of these neural markers  in ra treated ebs was also confirmed by western blotting . as shown in figure 3b, the induction of synemin h and synemin l was observed in differentiated es cells after ra treatment as well as an increase of synemin m.

when ra was added to ebs cells, the distribution of synemin h and m was limited to the inner cells of the eb and to a subpopulation of cells that migrated from it, presumably radial glia cells. differentiated es cells presented an evident heterogeneity. we observed that almost all of the neural precursors  expressing synemin h and synemin m are nestin positive . the expression of synemin h in differentiated es cells was always associated with synemin m. during glial cell differentiation, synemin h and m were expressed in the immature astrocytes cells harboring low level of gfap . in contrast, synemin h/m expression became extinct when astrocytes express high level of gfap .

the neuronal differentiation in ebs was also observed after ra treatment. these neuronal cells positive to β-iii tubulin did not contain the synemin h/m . however, the antibody directed against synemin l reacted with the neurons expressing β-iii tubulin .

our in vivo analysis in the adult mouse brain also confirmed the expression of synemins h and m in multipotent neural stem cells. these synemin isoforms were detected only in multipotent neural stem cells, particularly in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle , a neurogenic germinal site in adult mice  <cit> . however, gfap was present in these neural stem cells as well as in mature cortical astrocytes .

synemin knockdown in mouse es cells by shrna lentiviral particles
to test whether synemin expression is functionally required in es cells, we carried out a synemin knockdown experiment in mouse es cells by shrna lentiviral particles transduction. the transduced mouse es cell clumps were selected via puromycin dihydrochloride selection, and then analyzed by qrt-pcr, western blot and immunocytochemistry. this study showed that knocking down synemin  decreased the expression of keratin  <dig> by  <dig> % at mrna level . a similar decrease was also detected by western blotting  and immunocytochemistry analyses . blast program  analysis indicates that three synemin sirna sequences used in this experiment do not share any homology with other genes, so k <dig> decrease in this study is unlikely due to the direct inhibition of synemin sirna. the relationship between synemin and k <dig> in es cells remains to be studied. synemin knockdown in mouse es cells did not influence the expression of oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig> . this result was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry study . in order to determine whether synemin knockdown can affect the growth ability of mouse es cells, mtt assay was used to test the changes of cell growth ability. as seen in figure  <dig>  there is no significant modification of cell proliferation in the shsyn group when compared to the control group.

discussion
the exact mechanisms underlying the developmental changes in stem cell and precursor population are not understood. the adult vertebrate cns consists of four major differentiated cell types: neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells. how these differentiated cell types are generated during early embryogenesis remains mostly unknown due to the complexity of cell structure in this system, the lack of specific cell surface markers to identify distinct cell types and the presence of numerous amplifying cell population in transit that rapidly generate early progenitors. we demonstrated here that synemin expression is characteristic of mouse es cell lines in the undifferentiated state and the neural stem cells at both mrna and protein levels. our experiment showed that mouse pluripotent es cells expressed synemin m, prior to nestin, which is considered as a marker of neural stem cells  <cit> . moreover, this expression was associated with a common transcriptional signature that is shared by stem cells. this signature includes the expression of stem cell markers, such as homeobox protein nanog, a transcription factor that functions in concert with other factors such as oct <dig> and sox <dig> to establish the self-renewal of undifferentiated es cells  <cit> , oct <dig>  a transcription factor restricted to totipotent and pluripotent cells  <cit> , and ssea- <dig>  an es cell surface biomarker  <cit> . it has been reported that there is a strong correlation between oct <dig> gene expression and synemin regulation. knocking down oct <dig> by rnai resulted in a dramatic decrease of synemin m  <cit> . synemin knockdown in mouse es cells by shrna lentiviral particles did not modify the expression of oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig>  showing that synemin can not influence these transcriptional factors. as oct <dig> is required to maintain the pluripotentiality and self-renewal of es cells and since synemin m expression is under its regulation, this suggests that synemin m could be implicated in es cell maintenance. synemin knockdown did not influence the es cell growth. the exact nature of how synemin is implicated in the maintenance of mouse es cells remains to be studied.

cytoskeletal proteins play important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, migration and differentiation. among the three types of cytoskeletal elements, two are clearly present in mouse oocytes: microtubules and microfilaments, the presence of ifs being more controversial. the organization and role of the cytoskeletal networks  during oogenesis, fertilization and pre-implantation development of the mouse are described given the importance of cell-cell interactions and of the subcellular organization in events leading to the formation of the first two lineages of the mouse embryo  <cit> . in recent years, ifs have attracted much interest, largely because their constitutive polypeptide units are specifically expressed in various cell types and thus represent excellent differentiation markers  <cit> . however, the presence of ifs in es cells is not clear, and there is no evidence supporting a role for if proteins in es cell. cytokeratins seem to be the first ifs expressed in embryogenesis  <cit> . our findings represent the first evidence that synemin m could be a novel characteristic of stem cells. our functional study demonstrated that synemin knockdown in es cells by shrna lentiviral particle transduction also decreased keratin  <dig> expression. however, their correlation in es cells is still not clear. in addition, our protein analysis showed that pluripotent es cells contain two spot groups with isoelectric variants of synemin m . these isoelectric variations of synemin m may reflect differences on its phosphorylation level. in fact, we have observed that two spot trains of synemin m were phosphorylated . it is known that ifs are among the most abundant cellular phosphoproteins, their physiologic phosphorylation is typically heterogeneous and implicated in the structural organization of ifs  <cit> . early studies indicated that synemin provides temporal and spatial targeting of protein kinase a  in adult and neonatal cardiac myocytes  <cit> . pka targeted to ifs could phosphorylate its substrates and it was previously reported that the synemin avian ortholog is phosphorylated by pka  <cit> . moreover, synemin itself may be regulated through phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of pka  <cit> . it is also noteworthy that the camp/pka pathway plays an important role in murine es cell self-renewal pathways. directly inhibiting pka activity in the presence of lif causes a decrease in oct <dig> expression; however, in the absence of lif, there is increased oct <dig> expression  <cit> . the further investigation may be particularly attractive to identify the mechanism by which the post-translational modification of synemin protein is taken place during stem cell differentiate.

during neural differentiation of es cells evoked by ra-treatment, the expression of synemin h was induced in neural stem cells along with synemin m, nestin and gfap expression, which characterizes synemin h as a potential marker of the neural stem cell differentiation. our in vivo analysis also confirmed the expression of synemins h and m in multipotent neural stem cells in the subventricular zone of the adult mouse brain, a niche of the neural stem cells  <cit> . furthermore, in agreement with our previous data, synemin l is expressed only in mature neurons  <cit> . this selectivity suggests that the commitment of neural precursors to form astroglia or neuron as early as stem cell differentiation involves the direct regulation of the single synemin gene. we therefore believe that the production of synemin proteins is closely associated with the early specialization of es cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here demonstrates a complex regulation of synemin gene expression and a developmental stage specific production of each isoform in es cells and during their neural differentiation. the expression of synemins is characteristic of mouse es cell lines in the undifferentiated state and the neural stem cells. synemin m was present in pluripotent es cells, together with oct-3/ <dig> and ssea- <dig>  prior to nestin, a known marker of neural stem cells. synemin h is up regulated during retinoic acid induced neural differentiation and allows a distinction between an es cell state and a neural committed stage. during neural differentiation there was also a distinct expression of synemin h, m and l. synemin h and m are specific for the glial lineage during neural differentiation, whereas synemin l characterized only neuronal cells. the synemin knockdown in es cells has no influence on expression of oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig>  but decreased keratin  <dig> expression. taken together, the findings herein represent the first evidence that synemins might offer potentially novel and useful markers for distinguishing multipotent es cells from undifferentiated neural stem cells and more committed progenitor cells.
