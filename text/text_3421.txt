BACKGROUND
sphingosine-1-phosphate  is a biologically active lysophospholipid that is involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation, migration, cytoskeletal reorganization, and apoptosis  <cit> . s1p is produced by sphingosine kinase  <dig> and  <dig>  from sphingosine in response to various cellular stimuli, including vascular endothelial growth factor , platelet-derived growth factor , tumor necrosis factor-α , transforming growth factor-beta , epidermal growth factor  and cytokines  <cit> . after release from cells, s1p acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner through its cell surface receptors to influence cellular processes.

s1p receptors  are g protein-coupled receptors  critical for s1p action; five subtypes have been described s1p1-5r  <cit> . three s1p receptor subtypes  are expressed in the adult cardiovascular system, each with a unique pattern of expression  <cit> . s1p1r is strongly expressed in cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelium  <cit> . s1p2r is the dominate receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> . s1p3r is highly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts  <cit> .

in the developing embryo, s1p <dig> , <dig> r expression is detected in the murine heart from embryonic days   <dig> - <dig>  by reverse transcriptase  pcr  <cit> . s1p5r expression is not detected in the developing heart by either rt-pcr or in situ hybridization  <cit> . s1p1r is the only s1p receptor detected in the heart from e <dig>  to e <dig>  by in situ hybridization  <cit> . s1p1r is exclusively expressed in the heart at e <dig> -e <dig>  and is strongly expressed in the heart and developing vasculature throughout the embryo from e <dig> - <dig> , as well as other tissues including branchial arches, limb buds, and brain  <cit> .

s1p action is implicated in the regulation of numerous cardiovascular processes including angiogenesis, vascular permeability, arteriogenesis, cardiac function, vascular development, and vascular tone  <cit> . in fish, deletion of s1p2rs  results in cardia bifida, which is caused by a failure of the myocardial precursor cells to migrate to the ventral midline of the embryo and fuse to form the heart tube  <cit> .

in mice, deletion of s1p1r causes embryonic death between e <dig>  and e <dig>  due to defects in vascular maturation  <cit> . in s1p1r-/- embryos, the failure of vascular smooth muscle cells  to surround and support the developing vasculature results in massive hemorrhaging  <cit> . the bleeding observed in s1p1r-/- embryos results from a loss of receptor expression specifically in the endothelium  <cit> . the loss of s1p2r or s1p3r individually have no adverse affects on cardiovascular development in mice, and null animals are viable  <cit> . however, loss of both s1p2r and s1p3r leads to reduced viability after e <dig> , possibly due to abnormal endothelium formation in microvessels  <cit> . although an important role for s1p in vascular development has been observed  <cit> , our understanding of the role of s1p during cardiac development is limited.

disruptions in cardiac cushion tissue development can lead to septation and valve defects in the heart, which are among the most common congenital heart malformations observed in humans  <cit> . a major component of cardiac cushion development is the transformation of endothelial cells into mesenchymal cells that invade the cushion tissue and contribute to the formation of mature heart valves  <cit> . some signaling molecules, including tgfβ and vegf, that are involved in promoting and inhibiting endothelial to mesenchymal cell transformation  in the heart can also regulate s1p production by influencing sphk  <cit> .

we demonstrated that altered s1p signaling disrupts cell morphology and cell survival in cardiac cushion tissue  <cit> . elevated s1p levels lead to changes in the actin cytoskeleton and cell rounding  <cit> . in addition, s1p inhibits cell migration and prevents endothelial to mesenchymal cell transformation  in atrioventricular  canal cushions  <cit> . in contrast, reducing s1p synthesis by treating with n, n-dimethylsphingosine , an inhibitor of sphk, causes apoptosis of myocardial and endocardial cells in av canal cushions  <cit> .

we now identify s1p1rs as the primary mediators of s1p action in cardiac cushion tissue, and demonstrate that loss of s1p1rs disrupts cardiac development, in part by reducing cell proliferation and reducing fn expression in the heart.

RESULTS
s1p1r is the most highly expressed s1p receptor in the developing heart
to assess relative expression levels of s1p receptors, we performed quantitative real-time pcr analysis with rna isolated from embryonic hearts at e <dig> , the beginning of cardiac cushion development, and at e <dig> , a late stage of cardiac cushion development. please note that specific radiolabeled ligands are not available to directly characterize receptor binding site expression. real-time pcr revealed that s1p1r is the predominate s1p receptor expressed in e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryonic hearts and that s1p2r, s1p3r, and s1p4r are expressed at very low levels compared to s1p1r . using mean normalized expression methods to analyze real-time pcr results, it was observed that s1p1r was expressed at greater than 10-fold higher levels than other s1p receptor subtypes in the developing heart, and that s1p1r gene expression in the rest of the embryo was low compared to the heart at these early embryonic stages .

to localize the expression of s1p1r at the cellular level, we performed immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody against s1p1r. s1p1r protein was localized to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in the heart at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . myocardium of both the ventricle and atrium expressed s1p1r protein at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . in addition, s1p1r protein was detected in vascular endothelial cells throughout the embryo . these patterns of s1p1r expression are similar to that observed in the adult  <cit> . these data show that s1p1rs are the primary receptor subtype expressed in the early developing murine heart.

as detailed above, we demonstrate that s1p1r is highly expressed from e <dig>  to e <dig> , stages that span an important developmental period for the heart. during these stages, there is expansion of the cardiac cushions and the beginning of their refinement into cardiac valves  <cit> . in addition, the myocardium undergoes differentiation and development of the compact outer layer of the heart as well as formation of trabeculae  <cit> . our gene expression results were consistent with in situ hybridization analysis  <cit> , which demonstrated that of the five s1p receptor subtypes, only s1p1r was detected in the developing heart at the stages we examined. here, we expand on earlier analysis and demonstrate that s1p1rs are expressed at the protein level in both myocardial and endocardial cells during early heart development. taken together these data indicate that s1p1r is expressed at the right time and in the right cells to influence multiple aspects of cardiac development.

s1p1r mediates effects of s1p treatment on av canal cultures
to identify the s1p receptor subtype that mediate s1p action, agonists and antagonists to specific s1p receptors were applied to av canals grown in culture. the doses used were previously validated to either block or activate specific s1p receptors  <cit> .

fty <dig>  an agonist for s1p <dig> , <dig>  when converted to fty720-p by sphk <dig>  caused similar effects on av canal cultures as s1p in a dose-dependent manner . treatment of av canals with  <dig>  μm fty <dig> inhibited cellular outgrowth from the explants by 15%, and inhibited emt by 72%. treatment with  <dig>  μm fty <dig> caused a 40% decrease in cellular outgrowth and a 79% inhibition of emt . these two doses of fty <dig> induced changes in cell morphology, including cell rounding and actin cortical stress fiber formation . this cellular phenotype was in contrast to the fusiform shape of vehicle-treated cells that have many cellular processes extending from the cell body, indicating cellular migration over the surface of the collagen gel . at the highest dose of  <dig>  μm, fty <dig> completely inhibited cell migration and emt . in addition,  <dig>  μm fty <dig> treatment caused explant death, as measured by beating. only 42%  of  <dig>  μm fty720-treated explants were still beating and alive at the end of  <dig> hours of incubation, compared to 100% for vehicle ,  <dig>  μm fty <dig> , or  <dig>  μm fty <dig>  treated explants.

we next tested the s1p1r-specific agonist krp <dig>  <cit> . krp <dig> inhibited cellular outgrowth and emt in a dose-dependent manner. treatment with  <dig>  μm krp <dig> inhibited outgrowth from the av canal explants by  <dig> % and blocked emt by  <dig> % .  <dig>  μm krp <dig> inhibited cellular outgrowth by  <dig> % and inhibited emt by  <dig> % in av canal cultures . krp <dig> caused changes in cell morphology, similar to s1p and fty <dig> treatment, which included cell rounding, fewer filapodia extending from the cells, and the formation of actin stress fibers . at a higher dose of  <dig>  μm, krp <dig> inhibited outgrowth by  <dig> % and completely blocked emt . as with the highest dose of fty <dig>   <dig>  μm krp <dig> caused av canal explant death. only  <dig> %  of  <dig>  μm krp203-treated explants were alive and beating after  <dig> hours as compared to 100% of explants treated either with vehicle  or  <dig>  μm krp <dig> .

since higher doses of fty <dig> and krp <dig> caused explant death, we tested whether the lower doses of fty <dig>  and krp <dig>  caused an increase in cell death in either endothelial cells or cardiomyocytes of av canal explants, without causing complete explant death. using a cell viability assay, we determined that s1pr agonist treatment affects cell morphology and cell migration independent of cell toxicity. the calcein am  staining clearly marked the majority of the muscle cells in the explant and numerous endothelial cells on the collagen gel surface, regardless of treatment . the ethidium homodimer- <dig>  staining showed minimal dead cells in the muscle explant and some dead cells on the surface of the gel with each treatment . however, it did not appear that either fty <dig>  or krp <dig>  treatment increased cell death significantly above what was observed in vehicle-treated cultures .

another s1p receptor expressed in adult cardiac tissue is s1p3r  <cit> . although the level of s1p3r expression in the developing heart was much lower than s1p1r in our real-time pcr experiments, we tested whether it could mediate s1p effects in our av canal cultures. we treated cultures with cay <dig>  a specific s1p3r antagonist  <cit> . cay <dig>  treatment alone had no adverse effects on the av canal cultures . pretreatment of av canal cultures with cay <dig> was unable to prevent cell rounding or inhibition of cellular outgrowth caused by s1p treatment .

as we reported, s1p action can directly effect cardiac development and differentiation in an in vitro culture system  <cit> . in our current studies, we used agonists and antagonists to specific s1p receptors to determine which receptor subtype mediates s1p action in the developing heart. the s1p1r specific agonist  had similar effects on cell morphology and migration as s1p, which indicates that s1p1rs are the critical s1p receptors in the embryonic heart. fty <dig> does not bind s1p2rs  <cit> , thus we can eliminate s1p2rs as the predominate mediators of s1p signaling in av canals because fty <dig> treatment leads to similar changes in cell motility and morphology as s1p. s1p3rs do not appear to be the primary mediators of s1p action either since an s1p3r-specific antagonist could not prevent s1p from inhibiting cell migration and emt. s1p4r is only minimally expressed in the heart as detected by rt-pcr, and s1p5r is not at all expressed in the heart, as previously reported  <cit> , both of which suggest that they are not critical for s1p action in the av canals. taken together, these data indicate that s1p1rs are the primary mediators of s1p action in cardiac cushion tissue. these experiments, however, do not eliminate the possibility that other receptors like s1p2r and s1p3r, both of which have a low level of expression in the embryonic heart, could also mediate s1p signaling in the developing heart, especially if s1p1r expression is lost. the notion that s1p receptor subtypes can compensate for the loss of other subtypes in the cardiovascular system is supported by data showing that gene knockout of multiple s1p receptor subtypes leads to more severe phenotypes and younger embryonic lethality  <cit> .

loss of s1p1r expression disrupts cardiac development
to complement pharmacological studies assessing the role of s1p1r during heart development, we examined the morphology of s1p1r-/- embryonic hearts at two embryonic stages e <dig>  and e <dig> . examination of e <dig>  hearts was chosen for two reasons. first, cardiac cushion development is well underway at this stage and we could thus compare in vivo cushion development with that observed in our in vitro av canal culture system. second, e <dig>  embryos do not show signs of hemorrhage. e <dig>  was selected because s1p1r-/- embryos are alive at this age and are represented at the correct mendelian ratio, where as s1p1r-/- embryos begin to die at e <dig> . although e <dig>  s1p1r-/- embryos have some intra-embryonic bleeding and their limbs are underdeveloped, their overall size is similar to s1p1r+/+ littermates  <cit> .

e <dig>  s1p1r-/- embryos were not significantly smaller than s1p1r+/+ or s1p1r+/- littermates. the crown-rump  lengths of e <dig>  embryos were s1p1r+/+  <dig>  mm ±  <dig>  mm, n = 5; s1p1r+/-  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, n = 12; s1p1r-/-  <dig>  mm ±  <dig>  mm, n =  <dig>  however, the hearts of s1p1r-/- embryos had reduced myocardial tissue, with ventricular myocardial area reduced by 27% compared to s1p1r+/+ littermates . the heart walls in the s1p1r-/- primitive ventricle were thinner and the trabeculae were less developed compared to s1p1r+/+ and s1p1r+/- littermates . no differences in the sizes of the outflow tract  or av canal cushions were observed at e <dig>  .

no differences in embryo sizes were observed between s1p1r genotypes at e <dig> . the cr lengths of e <dig>  embryos were s1p1r+/+  <dig>  mm ±  <dig>  mm, n = 6; s1p1r+/-  <dig>  mm ±  <dig>  mm, n = 19; s1p1r-/-  <dig>  mm ±  <dig>  mm, n =  <dig>  s1p1r-/- hearts, though, were smaller with a shortened long axis and reduced overall ventricular tissue . the average length of s1p1r-/- hearts was 21% less than s1p1r+/+ hearts when measured from the av canal to the apex of the heart . s1p1r-/- hearts had 21% less ventricular myocardial tissue than s1p1r+/+ hearts . cardiac cushions in e <dig>  hearts did not show differences in size among the different s1p1r genotypes .

to assess the myocardial structure of s1p1r-/- hearts, immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the myocardial marker sarcomeric α-actin was performed. this analysis revealed disrupted morphology in e <dig>  s1p1r-/- hearts, they displayed a thickened and more disorganized ventricular myocardial wall and trabeculae compared to the tightly compacted ventricular wall and well-organized trabeculae of s1p1r+/+ hearts . in addition, the apexes of the s1p1r-/- hearts were blunted and rounded as compared to s1p1r+/+ hearts, which exhibited a v shape that tapers to the apex .

to characterize the cardiac cushion tissue and extra-cellular matrix  structure in s1p1r-/- hearts, we performed immunohistochemistry against fibronectin , an important ecm component in the heart during development. this analysis identified disruptions in the pattern of fibronectin protein expression in the heart at e <dig>  . in s1p1r+/+ hearts, there was strong staining for fn in the subepicardial layer, discrete fn deposition in the myocardium, and strong fn deposition in the cardiac cushions . in contrast, s1p1r-/- hearts showed reduced fn expression throughout the myocardium of the ventricular wall and trabeculae, as well as reduced fn deposition in the cardiac cushions . although s1p1r-/- hearts displayed fn expression in the epicardial layer, this expression revealed a less cohesive epicardial layer with areas detached from the underlying myocardial layer .

to determine if the reduced size of s1p1r-/- hearts was due to increased cell death or decreased cell proliferation, we performed tunel analysis or immunostained for the proliferation marker phospho-histone h <dig>  we observed a very low rate of cell death in e <dig>  hearts of all s1p1r genotypes examined. throughout the entire heart, including the ventricle, atrium and cardiac cushions, there were no more than  <dig> tunel-positive cells per section, and often there were no tunel-positive cells in a particular heart section. to quantitate the amount of cell death, myocardial cells were analyzed, as they were the most numerous cell type. the rate of cell death as determined by tunel analysis in the myocardium was not significantly different among the three s1p1r genotypes. the cell death rates were s1p1r+/+  <dig> % ±  <dig> , n = 3; s1p1r+/-  <dig> % ±  <dig> , n = 3; s1p1r-/-  <dig> % ±  <dig> , n = 3; . in contrast to cell death, a decrease in the cell proliferation rate was observed in the myocardial cells of e <dig>  hearts. s1p1r-/- myocardial cells had a reduction in cell proliferation of 33%, the rates were s1p1r+/-  <dig> % ±  <dig> , n =  <dig>  and s1p1r-/-  <dig> % ±  <dig> , n =  <dig> .

examination of s1p1r-/- embryonic hearts revealed two distinct problems associated with the loss of s1p1r expression. first, s1p1r-/- hearts were disproportionately smaller than the rest of the embryo. second, the overall morphology of the hearts was disrupted at each embryonic stage examined. the decrease in cardiac size is in part due to the reduction in cell proliferation in myocardial cells and not an increase in cell death. s1p has been shown to be a potent stimulator of cell proliferation, especially in cardiovascular cells  <cit> .

the explanation for the disrupted cardiac morphology is less clear. at e <dig>  the myocardial layer was thinner in s1p1r-/- hearts compared to s1p1r+/+ littermates. at e <dig> , s1p1r-/- hearts displayed an irregular outer myocardial layer of uneven thickness, possibly due to altered cell proliferation rates observed in s1p1r-/- hearts.

another possible explanation for the malformed myocardium in s1p1r-/- hearts could be a disruption in the epicardium. similar defects in cardiac development have been observed when epicardium formation was defective, resulting in thin ventricular myocardium, disrupted compact layer formation, and malformations in cardiac cushion development  <cit> . an important component of the epicardial layer is the extra-cellular matrix molecule fibronectin, which is critical for the migration of epicardial cells over the myocardium  <cit> . in addition, it was reported that s1p stimulates fn matrix assembly and that inhibition of sphingosine kinase  <dig> leads to decreased fn expression  <cit> . this idea that altered s1p signaling disrupts fn expression and leads to cardiac malformations is supported by our immunohistochemical analysis of fn. we observed reduced levels of fn in the cardiac cushions and throughout the myocardium of s1p1r-/- hearts. in addition, our analysis of fn revealed a disruption in the epicardial layer, including portions of the layer that have delaminated from the underlying myocardium. this disrupted epicardial layer may explain the disorganized myocardium observed in the compact layer of s1p1r-/- hearts; however, further analysis of the role of s1p during epicardial development will be needed to investigate this possibility.

other than reduced fn expression, there are no major differences in the cardiac cushions of s1p1r-/- and s1p1r+/+hearts. it is difficult to directly compare the in vitro and in vivo cardiac cushion results because the alterations in s1p signaling are different. in vitro, the loss of s1p signaling, due to a block in s1p production, results in cell death, whereas only s1p1r signaling is lost in the in vivo transgenic model, which results in reduced cell proliferation. in the in vivo model, it is possible that other s1p receptors expressed in the heart may compensate for the loss of s1p1r, which is not possible in the in vitro model since all s1p signaling is blocked. as for the effects of s1p and s1p1r agonists, their treatment causes increased s1p signaling, which is opposite to the in vivo model where s1p1r signaling is lost. these opposite effects on s1p signaling may explain why the in vitro system shows a dramatic effect on cell morphology and migration, where as no gross morphological differences in the cardiac cushions are observed with the in vivo model.

s1p1r-/- embryos die at e <dig>  due to a failure in the maturation of the vasculature, which leads to hemorrhaging and death  <cit> . these previously reported data support the idea that effects on cardiac development observed in the s1p1r-/- embryos could be secondary to vascular defects. however, data in this report indicates that loss of s1p1r-/- expression leads to direct effects on cardiac growth and morphogenesis at these early stages, specifically: 1) s1p1rs are highly expressed in the heart, 2) altered s1p signaling in isolated heart tissue causes cell morphology and cell migration defects, 3) s1p1r-/- embryos are alive and not smaller than s1p1r+/+ littermates, 4) s1p1r-/- hearts are smaller than s1p1r+/+ littermates, 5) s1p1r-/- myocardial cells have reduced cell proliferation rates compared to s1p1r+/- myocardial cells in vivo. 6) s1p1r-/- hearts have reduced fn deposition in the heart compared to s1p1r+/+ littermates.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings identify s1p1rs as the predominate mediators of s1p action in developing av canal tissue and demonstrate that loss of s1p1rs disrupt normal cardiac development. these findings identify s1p acting via s1p1rs as an important mediator of cardiac development through the regulation of cell morphology, cell proliferation and fibronectin expression. identifying factors that influence cardiac development is critical for increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease, with the ultimate goal of decreasing disease morbidity and mortality. further studies are required to determine whether factors that alter s1p levels during embryonic development can also influence cardiac development.
