BACKGROUND
advances in the methodology of qpcr contributed significantly to a widespread use of this method for dna genotyping, gene expression analysis and mutational scanning. several different systems have been developed for continuous monitoring of the production of pcr amplicons and characterization of their properties. widely used are sequence-specific probes which facilitate a highly sensitive detection of specific pcr products. however, these probes are difficult to prepare and are relatively expensive  <cit> . an alternative to the probe-based methods is the use of dna-intercalating dyes which at concentrations compatible with pcr-mediated dna amplification exhibit enhanced fluorescence after binding to double-stranded dna. these dyes are less expensive, but they are also less specific because they bind to all dsdnas present in pcr mixtures, including nonspecific products and primer-dimers. although some of these unwanted dna species can be distinguished by analysis of the melting curves of pcr amplicons, their presence reduces the sensitivity of qpcr and requires a proper adjustment of pcr conditions. biophysical studies showed that dna dyes bind to dsdna by intercalation and external binding, and that these interactions could interfere with pcr  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that the dyes also react with single-stranded dna oligonucleotide primers  <cit>  and that this binding could inhibit annealing of the primers to the template during pcr  <cit> . this could account for some difficulties in amplifying certain dna fragments, which are otherwise easily amplified in the absence of the dyes.

in initial studies, real-time accumulation of pcr amplicons was evaluated with ethidium bromide  <cit> . this dye was later substituted with sgi  <cit> , which quickly became the most-widely used dna dye for qpcr monitoring. recently, several other dna dyes have been introduced giving a strong fluorescence signal with dsdna at concentrations not inhibiting pcr. these include yo-pro- <dig>  <cit> , bebo  <cit> , lcgreen  <cit> , syto- <dig>  <cit> , evagreen  <cit> , syto- <dig>  syto- <dig>  <cit>  and lightcycler  <dig> resolight dye  <cit> .

we have found that sgi inhibits amplification of medium-size genomic dna fragments and that this inhibitory effect can be reduced by using a pcr mix, denoted here as mix iv, with modified salt composition  <cit> . in this study, we compared qpcr performance of seven dna dyes  in the mix iv and three other widely used pcr mixes of different salt composition. we found that amplification in the presence of sgi was optimal in mix iv, whereas all other dyes performed better in a mix marked here as mix ii. to find out conditions which would allow efficient amplification of difficult-to-amplify dna templates, such as those in whole blood and/or gc-rich and compatible with various dna dyes, we tested various additives and their combinations. excellent performance was found when pcr mix ii was supplemented with pt enhancer. extensive testing showed that pt enhancer-containing mix ii could be used for efficient amplification of various dna templates known to resist amplification under various routinely used conditions. the data have implications for a more rational design and routine use of qpcr assays.

RESULTS
pcr with difficult-to-amplify templates
in our previous study we showed that amplification of the  <dig> base pairs  genomic fragment of mouse thy- <dig> can be achieved only in a pcr mix denoted here as mix iv  <cit> . in this study, we first tested whether the mix iv was also optimal for qpcr analysis with other dna dyes. we compared amplification of thy- <dig> genomic dna fragment in mix iv and in three other widely used pcr mixes combined with seven dna dyes. properties of all dna dyes and composition of all pcr mixes used are shown in table  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. when sgi was combined with pcr mix iv, amplification was observed at all dilutions of the template dna with reasonable regression coefficient  and efficiency . in all other mixes amplification of the fragment was either absent  or poor . these data were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis . poor amplification in pcr mixes i - iii was obviously caused by the presence of sgi, since thy- <dig> was reproducibly amplified in its absence . changing the mg2+ concentration or optimizing the annealing temperature failed to improve the reaction in mixes i - iii. it should be noted that the amount of thy- <dig> amplicons in mix iv was similar regardless of the presence or absence of sgi , indicating that the salt composition of pcr mixes has a decisive role on the inhibitory effect of sgi.

when the same fragment was amplified in syto-9-supplemented pcr mixes, a different profile was obtained: strong amplification  was observed in mix ii, but only week and variable amplification, as detected by melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis, was observed in mixes i, iii and iv . mix ii was also optimal for other dna dyes . interestingly, inhibition of pcrs by different dyes varied in different mixes. in mix i, for example, amplification of thy- <dig> dna fragment was only observed at high concentrations of the template in the following order: syto- <dig> > syto- <dig> = syto- <dig>  in mix iii, some reactivity was observed with the following dyes: syto- <dig> > sgi = syto- <dig> = syto- <dig>  in mix iv, thy- <dig> amplification was seen in mixes supplemented with sgi > lcgreen > syto- <dig> > resolight > syto- <dig> = syto- <dig>  in several combinations of pcr mixes and dna dyes, complete inhibition of amplification was noted: sgi in mixes i and ii, evagreen in mixes i, iii and iv and lcgreen and resolight in mixes i and iii. this inhibition persisted even when concentration of mgcl <dig> was raised up to  <dig> mm .

fidelity assays
the observed difficulties with amplification of medium-size genomic dna fragments in some pcr mixes might in part reflect an enhanced mutagenesis interfering with the synthesis of dna fragments  <cit> . to find out whether salt composition of pcr mixes and the presence of dna dyes could affect the fidelity of pcrs, we used an assay system based on streptomycin resistance of rpsl mutants  <cit> . data presented in table  <dig> show that in mix i the error rate was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  a similar error rate was observed in mix ii and an approximately two-fold increase in mix iii and iv. to prove the sensitivity of the fidelity assay, we also amplified the template using kod polymerase in a reaction mix of undisclosed composition provided by the manufacturer of the enzyme. as expected, amplification with kod polymerase resulted in substantially lower error rate , which is in agreement with the manufacturer's data. when pcr mix ii was supplemented with syto- <dig>  syto- <dig>  evagreen, lcgreen or resolight, no dramatic changes in mutation frequencies were observed . these findings indicate that different mutation frequencies in different pcr mixes cannot by themselves explain the observed changes in amplification efficiency caused by various dna dyes.

new universal pcr master mix
in an attempt to develop a universal pcr master mix compatible with all the dna dyes and suitable for amplification of dna templates that cannot be readily amplified due to dye interference, presence of inhibitory substances and/or secondary structure formation, we tested several additives combined with mixes i - iv and various dna dyes. as a template we used gc-rich dna fragment of q8n1r <dig> gene  in human heparinized blood which escaped detection under standard conditions using various commercial pcr master mixes such as iq™ sybr green supermix and lightcycler  <dig> sybr green i master . in pilot experiments various mixes were combined with several additives and/or procedures, which have been reported to allow amplification of gc-rich fragments and/or neutralize pcr inhibitory components present in the blood . these included  <dig>  -  <dig>  m trehalose   <cit> ,  <dig> - 15% dimethyl sulfoxide   <cit> ,  <dig>  -  <dig>  m n,n,n-trimethylglycine monohydrate   <cit> , combinations of  <dig> - 15% dmso and  <dig>  m betaine  <cit> ,  <dig> -  <dig> mm tetrapropylammonium chloride  <cit> ,  <dig>  -  <dig>  m  <dig> -propanediol,  <dig>  -  <dig>  m ethyleneglycol  <cit> ,  <dig> -  <dig> μm 7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate  <cit> , pcr-enhancing coctail containing  <dig>  m d--trehalose,  <dig>  m l-carnitine, and  <dig> % nonidet p- <dig>   <cit>  and antibody-mediated hot start pcr  <cit>  combined with "touchdown" procedure  <cit> . yet, none of these additives and/or procedures improved pcr to get specific signal determined by agarose gel electrophoresis . interestingly, specific amplicons were observed in pcr mix ii supplemented with both  <dig> m  <dig> -propanediol and  <dig>  m trehalose ; higher or lower concentrations of these two additives resulted in inhibition of production of the specific amplicons and/or enhanced formation of nonspecific dna fragments .

** primer sets pr.  <dig> - pr.  <dig>  are based on ensembl release  <dig> - sept 2009

mix ii-pt allowed efficient amplification of numerous gene fragments in heparin-treated whole blood, including mouse thy- <dig> and ntal  and, as shown in figure  <dig> , gc-rich fragments of the human genes np_ <dig>  , q8wz <dig> , np_ <dig>  , q8n4x <dig> , np_ <dig>  , and q8n1r <dig> . pt enhancer also allowed efficient amplification of  <dig> bp dna fragment with  <dig> % gc  from whole blood which was resistant to amplification under standard conditions . in its enhancing capacity mix ii-pt surpassed the tcn enhancer  <cit> , which was capable of amplifying only one of the six gc-rich templates tested . similar results were obtained when blood samples were treated with other commonly used anticoagulants,  <dig>  mm edta or  <dig> % sodium citrate .

next we tested qpcr performance of various dna dyes in mix ii-pt during amplification of the gc-rich fragment  of q8n4x <dig> gene in whole human blood. pilot experiments indicated that different dilutions of whole human blood in water, followed by qpcr in mix ii-pt with sgi resulted in poor regression coefficients. this was probably caused by simultaneous dilution of the dna templates and the inhibitory  and/or stimulatory  components present in the whole blood samples. however, when human blood was diluted with mouse blood to keep the concentration of human/mouse blood in pcr constant , reasonable regression coefficients  and efficiencies  were obtained. amplification of nonspecific fragments after  <dig> cycles of pcr was low, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis . under the same conditions other dna dyes also gave satisfactory results in the following order : sgi > resolight > syto- <dig> > lcgreen > syto- <dig> > evagreen . thus, mix ii-pt is unique in its capability to serve as universal qpcr mix for all dna dyes tested.

pcr mix ii-pt could be used with advantage not only for amplification of dna fragments from crude blood samples that are difficult to amplify, but also for routine qpcr analysis of cdna fragments without time-consuming adjustment of qpcr conditions for individual primer sets. data presented in figure 5a show that for amplification of  <dig> bp fragment of actin cdna  mix ii-pt supplemented with sgi gave comparable regression coefficients and efficiencies as the routinely used lc  <dig> sgi. similar results were obtained when gapdh cdna fragment was analyzed . however, when low abundant cdna fragments were amplified, such as ormdl1_fr.a  or ormdl1_fr.b , detectable amplification at all concentrations of template cdna and reasonable regression coefficients and efficiencies were obtained only in mix ii-pt-supplemented samples. interestingly, addition of  <dig> -propanediol and/or trehalose at various concentrations to lc  <dig> sgi containing chemically modified taq dna polymerase did not improve performance of this pcr mix, but instead had an inhibitory effect .

fluorescence measurements and melting temperatures
in our previous study we showed that sgi bound to ssdna primers and suggested that the binding could at least in part contribute to the inhibitory effect of sgi in qpcr assays  <cit> . in further studies we evaluated whether trehalose and/or  <dig> -propanediol could interfere with interaction of various dna dyes with ssdna, as reflected by changes in fluorescence signal. data presented in figure 6a indicate that interaction of various dna dyes  with ssdna oligonucleotide primer for tumor necrosis factor  induced fluorescence in the following order: sgi < syto- <dig> < lcgreen < syto- <dig> < evagreen < resolight. addition of  <dig>  m trehalose had little to no inhibitory effect on this fluorescence. in contrast,  <dig> -propanediol significantly  decreased fluorescence in all dna dyes used, except for sgi. combination of both  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose had a similar effect as  <dig> -propanediol alone. when ssdna primer no.  <dig>  reverse  was used, basal level of fluorescence was increased in all dna dye-enhancer combinations and again trehalose had no significant effect on fluorescence intensity. in contrast to trehalose,  <dig> -propanediol significantly  decreased fluorescence, except for sgi and resolight .

in an attempt to understand the enhancing effect of trehalose and  <dig> -propanediol on qpcr performance, we also evaluated the melting temperatures of short dsdna oligonucleotides. when dsdna of tnf and anti-tnf  was used, the melting temperature depended on dna dye used . the highest melting temperature was observed in control mix ii supplemented with evagreen, followed by sgi > resolight > syto- <dig> > lcgreen > syto- <dig>  addition of  <dig>  m trehalose decreased the melting temperature by  <dig>  -  <dig> °c, whereas addition of  <dig> m  <dig> -propanediol decreased it by  <dig>  -  <dig> °c. when both trehalose and  <dig> -propanediol were used, further decrease by  <dig>  -  <dig> °c was observed. using dsdna oligonucleotide with  <dig> % gc, melting temperature was increased but a similar effect of trehalose and  <dig> -propanediol was observed .

cooperative effect of  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose
the above data suggested that  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose have different roles in promoting dna amplification of gc-rich dna fragments from crude blood samples: trehalose mainly acts by neutralizing the inhibitory components present in blood, whereas  <dig> -propanediol mainly acts by decreasing melting temperature. to prove this, we compared the effect of the enhancers on amplification of gc-rich fragments from whole blood or isolated dna. as expected, efficient amplification of dna template in whole blood, occurred only in samples supplemented with both  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose . in contrast, when isolated gc-rich dna fragment was used as a template, comparable amplification was observed in samples supplemented with  <dig> -propanediol alone or together with trehalose . trehalose alone was not able to promote amplification of the dna templates .

when pcr mix was supplemented with sgi and isolated dna was amplified, a different picture was observed. sgi partially inhibited amplification in  <dig> -propanediol-supplemented samples . this inhibition was caused by sgi as indicated by no inhibition in samples containing vehicle  instead of sgi . pcr mixes supplemented with both  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose exhibited an improved amplification in sgi-supplemented samples  indicating cooperative effect of the enhancers in sgi-supplemented samples.

next we tested the effect of trehalose and  <dig> -propanediol on amplification of isolated dna in samples supplemented with hemoglobin. pilot experiments showed that hemoglobin completely inhibited pcr at concentrations  <dig> μm and higher . data in figure 8a indicate that the inhibitory effect of hemoglobin  was removed by addition  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose together but not by trehalose or  <dig> -propanediol alone.

to understand the effect of the enhancers on amplification in the presence of blood inhibitors, we analyzed melting temperatures of dsdna. we found that hemoglobin at the inhibitory concentration  significantly decreased melting temperature of short dsdna fragments by  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c . addition of trehalose,  <dig> -propanediol or both enhancers to hemoglobin-supplemented samples further decreased tm by  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c,  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c and  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c, respectively . these data suggested direct or indirect interaction of hemoglobin with dna. the direct interaction was however weak, if any, as indicated by similar mobility in agarose gel of dna fragments alone and dna fragments mixed with hemoglobin .

finally, we tested whether blood inhibitors could interfere with enzymatic activity of taq dna polymerase as determined by incorporation of datp into activated salmon testes dna. data presented in figure 8c indicate that blood at the inhibitory concentration  significantly reduced activity of taq dna polymerase. addition of trehalose significantly  decreased the enzymatic activity of taq dna polymerase in control samples , but slightly increased the activity in blood-supplemented samples, leading to statistically non-significant differences between the control and blood-supplemented samples.  <dig> -propanediol decreased enzymatic activity of taq dna polymerase in both control and blood-supplemented samples; the difference between these two groups was statistically significant. addition of trehalose to  <dig> -propanediol-supplemented control samples  further significantly decreased  the activity of taq polymerase. in contrast, in blood-supplemented samples there was small  increase in activity of taq dna polymerase in pt-containing samples compared to samples containing  <dig> -propanediol alone. this led to non-significant differences between control and blood-containing samples with pt. these data indicate that trehalose has a different effect on activity of taq polymerase in control and blood containing samples. this could explain at least in part the enhancing effect of trehalose in samples containing blood inhibitors.

discussion
the aim of this study was to develop new qpcr mixes capable of amplifying difficult dna templates, such as those in whole blood, of medium size and/or gc-rich, in the presence of various dna dyes. first, we assessed the properties of seven different dna dyes in four widely used pcr buffers differing in salt composition. our data indicate that the performance of various dna dyes in qpcr is differently affected by salt composition of the pcr mixes. when genomic dna fragment of mouse thy- <dig>  was amplified, sgi completely inhibited pcr in most of the pcr mixes. the only pcr mix which allowed efficient amplification of the thy- <dig> fragment in the presence of sgi was mix iv, which differed from other mixes by the presence of both kcl and 2so <dig> and the substitution of mgso <dig> for mgcl <dig>  this mix had ph  <dig> , which also contributed to its performance; when ph of this mix was decreased to  <dig> , sgi-mediated inhibition of pcr was noticed . besides ph, salt composition also plays a role because sgi completely inhibited amplification in pcr mix ii, which has the same ph as mix iv. when other dyes were tested, amplification in mix iv was completely  or partially  inhibited or remained unchanged . in contrast to sgi, other dyes allowed amplification of the thy- <dig> genomic fragment when present in pcr mix ii. this mix is unique among others by containing  <dig> mm 2so <dig> instead of kcl, enhanced concentration of tris-hcl  and inclusion of tween  <dig> instead of triton x- <dig> . it should be mentioned that all pcrs were run under identical cycling conditions. optimization of annealing temperature and cycling conditions for individual sgi-supplemented pcr mixes, however, resulted in no substantial improvement of pcr efficiency . neither was any improvement achieved by varying the concentration of mg2+. since the concentrations of deoxynucleotide triphosphates , dna polymerase and anti-taq monoclonal antibody  were identical in all pcr mixes tested, it is likely that an interaction of dna dye with ionic environment is responsible for the observed differences in qpcr performance. both divalent and monovalent cations bind to dna and affect its physical properties  <cit> . thus, ionic environment and dna dyes could affect dna denaturation, annealing of oligonucleotide primers to the dna template and/or activity of taq dna polymerase, including its enhanced mutation frequency which could inhibit pcr  <cit> . our data indicate, however, that error rate was not dramatically affected and therefore it is unlikely that it could contribute to the observed differences in pcr mixes of different salt composition. neither was fidelity of the taq dna polymerase affected by the presence of various dna dyes.

under more stringent conditions, such as amplification of medium-size gc-rich genomic fragments from crude blood samples, no amplification was observed in various commercial and home-made pcr mixes with or without dna dye, and no dramatic improvement was achieved with additives and/or procedures recommended for amplification of gc-rich templates. these included supplementing pcr mixes with dmso, betaine, trehalose,  <dig> -propanediol or 7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate, performing hot-start pcr under "touchdown" conditions, or with recently introduced pcr enhancing coctail containing trehalose, l-carnitin and nonidet p- <dig> . it is likely that pcr product formation under such conditions was compromised by the presence of inhibitors present in blood , concurrently with inadequate strand separation due to higher gc content and/or formation of secondary structures reflecting hoogsteen base pairing between successive guanosine bases. furthermore, dna templates may create intramolecular stem loops formed during initial cycles of amplification, leading to formation of hairpin structures that are resistant to amplification by taq dna polymerase in subsequent cycles of pcr  <cit> .

interestingly, strong and specific amplification was observed when pcr mix ii was supplemented with both  <dig> m  <dig> -propanediol and  <dig>  m trehalose. this mix allowed efficient amplification in the presence of all dna dyes tested, including sgi. trehalose has been previously shown to enhance the yield of the amplified pcr products, and it has been speculated that it acts through its thermostabilizing effect and/or lowering the template melting temperature  <cit> . however, it is unlikely that any of these two factors contributed individually to the observed effect of trehalose. in fact, the enzymatic activity of taq dna polymerase preincubated for  <dig> min at 95°c in mix ii supplemented with  <dig>  m trehalose  was slightly decreased, rather than increased. furthermore, although  <dig>  m trehalose decreased melting temperature, this decrease was only marginal compared to the effect of other additives like dmso or betaine which are routinely used as pcr enhancers.

 <dig> -propanediol at a final concentration  <dig>  m has been recognized as an effective enhancer for amplification of medium-size gc-rich dna sequences  <cit> . although  <dig> -propanediol surpassed  <dig>  m betaine in its ability to amplify gc-rich templates  <cit>  and decreased the melting temperature of dsdna fragments , it was unable on its own to surpass the inhibitory effect caused by the components present in the whole blood. efficient amplification of such difficult-to-amplify templates was only achieved when  <dig> -propanediol was combined with trehalose. it should be noted, that  <dig> -propanediol slightly decreased enzymatic activity of taq dna polymerase. this inhibitory effect was however fully compensated by beneficial effects of  <dig> -propanediol on pcr performance. our finding of significant decrease of taq dna polymerase activity in samples supplemented with blood and even more with blood and  <dig> -propanediol, and removal of this inhibitory effect after addition of trehalose suggest that trehalose acts by protecting the enzyme from negative interference of the blood inhibitors. similarly, trehalose protected against the inhibitory effect of sgi, as indicated by enhanced amplification in the presence of both  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose, compared to  <dig> -propanediol alone.

in our previous study we found that sgi bound to ssdna primers and interfered with annealing of the primers to dna template; in this way sgi could, at least in part, contribute to its inhibitory effect on pcr  <cit> . in the present study we extended these tests to other dna dyes and found that all of them bound to ssdna oligonucleotides, as reflected by enhanced fluorescence. importantly, for most of the dyes this binding was decreased by  <dig> m  <dig>  propanediol. extent of the inhibition depended on a combination of dna dye used and gc content of the primers.

one of the pcr inhibitors present in blood is hemoglobin  <cit> . the inhibitory effect of hemoglobin on amplification of gc-rich dna fragments was counteracted by addition of pt enhancer but not by  <dig> -propanediol or trehalose alone. although hemoglobin decreased melting temperature of dsdna which was further decreased by the addition of  <dig> -propanediol, it was still not sufficient for removal of its inhibitory effect. interestingly, hemoglobin-containing samples supplemented with  <dig> -propanediol or  <dig> -propanediol and trehalose exhibited similar melting temperature, suggesting again that pt enhancer does not increase pcr performance solely by decreasing melting temperature.

zhang and collaborators recently described a tcn coctail which in combination with inhibitor-resistant taq dna polymerase mutants enabled efficient amplification of high-gc content dna targets directly from crude blood samples  <cit> . however, when wild-type taq dna polymerase was used for pcr with tcn, only a fraction of gc-rich dna templates in whole blood was amplified. under identical conditions, pcr mix supplemented with pt enhancer efficiently amplified all fragments analyzed in this study. these data indicate that pt is a superior enhancer for amplification of difficult templates when wild type taq dna polymerase is used. pt enhancer can be used as a universal enhancer suitable for normal targets, gc-rich targets  and/or targets in the presence of pcr inhibitors. pcr mix ii supplemented with pt enhancer is suitable for dna genotyping from whole blood without dna extraction and is compatible with various dna dyes. in order to get reasonable regression coefficients based on qpcr analyses of crude blood samples it is adviceable to dilute dna templates present in human blood with e.g. mouse blood to keep the amount of the blood components in pcr constant. this will eliminate the problems with simultaneous dilution of the inhibitory  and/or stimulatory  components which interfere with pcr performance, and/or recording of the fluorescence signal.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that a combination of  <dig> m  <dig> -propanediol and  <dig>  m trehalose represents a unique enhancer which can be combined with various dna dyes. the enhancer can be used for amplification of various dna templates, including those which are gc-rich and present in crude specimens, where other enhancers such as dmso or betaine fail.
