BACKGROUND
several independent studies have clearly shown that effector functions of recombinant therapeutic igg are directly dependent on the glycosylation of the constant region   <cit> . each heavy chain of igg <dig> fc fragment contains a single n-glycosylation site substituted by a biantennary complex glycan. the minimal core structure is a heptasaccharide  potentially substituted by galactose , bisecting n-acetylglucosamine , sialic acid  and/or fucose  residue α <dig> -linked to the first glcnac attached to asn <dig> of igg heavy chains  <cit> .

igg fc oligosaccharides determine the overall conformation of the fc fragment  <cit>  and modulate the capacity of igg to interact with fcγr  <cit> . therefore, it is clearly established that the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity  is dependent on appropriate glycosylation of the fc region of mabs . the specific role in adcc of each monosaccharide substituting the core structure has been studied in details, showing the key role of the core fucose in cellular toxicity  <cit> . low fucose igg <dig>  exhibit a higher adcc activity compared to highly fucosylated igg  either in vitro  <cit>  or in vivo  <cit> .

the most widely used recombinant antibodies are produced by rodent mammalian cell lines with intrinsic fucosyltransferase activity , mouse myeloma and hybridoma cell lines). therefore, almost all licensed therapeutic antibodies developed to date are heavily fucosylated  <cit> , which results in a non-optimized adcc. reducing the α <dig> -fucose rate of igg fc has been a challenge over the last few years to provide maximum efficiency to recombinant mabs.

in mammals, the gdp-l-fuc: n-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide α <dig> -fucosyltransferase  is the only enzyme able to catalyze the transfer of a fuc residue in α <dig> -linkage to the first glcnac residue of n-glycan chains  <cit> . gdp-fucose, the unique donor substrate of fucosyltransferases, is synthesized in the cytoplasm from gdp-mannose, via three enzymatic reactions carried out by two proteins: gdp-mannose  <dig> -dehydratase  and gdp-4-keto-6-deoxymannose  <dig> -epimerase, 4-reductase   <cit> . the gdp-fucose is then transported into the lumen of the golgi apparatus by a gdp-fucose transporter  located at the golgi membrane  <cit> , where it serves as a substrate in the synthesis of fucosylated glycoconjugates  <cit> . α <dig> -fuct is encoded by the fut <dig> gene and different strategies targeting fut <dig> or other fucose-related genes have been developed to reduce the fucosylation capacity of recombinant mab producing cells. the fut <dig> gene  <cit> , the gmd gene  <cit> , or both  <cit>  have been knockdown in cho cells, generating completely non-fucosylated recombinant mabs. fut <dig> sirna was also used for engineering cho cells to upgrade effector function of produced antibodies  <cit>  and recently, short-hairpin-rna has been developed for the silencing of fut <dig> in cho, resulting in an enhanced antibody immune effector function  <cit> . glycosylation inhibitors were also proposed to enhance cellular toxicity of recombinant igg  <cit>  and lectin-affinity chromatography techniques have been applied to enrich in non-fucosylated species the produced recombinant mabs  <cit> .

alternative cell lines have been tested for the reduction of core fucose on recombinant mabs. the lec <dig> mutant cho cell line, partially deficient in gmd  <cit>  was used to produce human igg <dig> that were deficient in fucose  <cit> . as an alternative, the rat hybridoma cell line yb2/ <dig> was proposed as a good candidate for the large-scale production of low fucose igg  <cit> . thus, this cell line has a very good capacity of igg biosynthesis and its fucose transfer capacity is much lower than the other rodent cell lines commonly used  <cit> . however, important variations of the fucose content has been observed for the producing clones in production culture conditions  <cit> , indicating that a better knowledge of the capacity of the yb2/ <dig> fucosylation machinery is required for optimizing the fucosylation of recombinant mabs at the production level. thus, we have analyzed the fucosylation capacity of yb2/ <dig> and we report here the molecular cloning of the rat fut <dig> cdna, the fut <dig> gene organization including 5'-untranslated exons and transcription start-sites, the number of fut <dig> copies in yb2/ <dig> nuclear genome and the analysis of two promoter regions  governing fut <dig> transcription in these cells. in particular, we identified several potential repressor binding sequences in both minimal promoters and showed that klf <dig> can repress the activity of p <dig> promoter region.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of the rat α <dig>  fucosyltransferase cdna
in order to clone the rat fut <dig> cdna, the putative rat mrna sequence of  <dig> pb  provided by the ncbi genome annotation division http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez was used as a probe for blast analysis of rat genomic and est divisions of ncbi databases. the coding sequence of rat α <dig>  fucosyltransferase was localized on chromosome  <dig>  divided into nine exons and spanning over  <dig> kb . homologous est sequences obtained were conceptually translated and partially overlapping sequences were assembled to build a larger open reading frame  . three ests cb <dig> , cb  <dig>  and cb <dig>  correspond to the 5'-region of the fut <dig> gene, and the sequences fm <dig> , dv <dig>  and cb <dig>  correspond to the 3'-region. these sequences were used to generate oligonucleotide primers located in the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions for pcr cloning. a unique  <dig> pb pcr fragment was amplified from yb2/ <dig> cells cdna library, cloned into the pcr ii-blunt topo vector and entirely sequenced.

the amplified sequence contains an orf of  <dig> bp, showing  <dig> nucleotide changes , + <dig> , + <dig>  and  <dig>  from atg) compared to the putative rat fut <dig> orf sequence , which were also found, at least for two of them, in est sequences of the ncbi databases  and reflect a silent allelic polymorphism in rat fut <dig> gene without change in the amino-acid sequence of the polypeptide. the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the full-length cdna obtained are shown in figure  <dig>  the position of the initiation codon was estimated according to the kozak consensus sequence  <cit> . hydropathy analysis of the polypeptide indicated the presence of a hydrophobic sequence of  <dig> amino acids in the nh2-terminal region, corresponding to the transmembrane domain characteristic of type ii golgi glycosyltransferases. the predicted protein consisted of  <dig> amino acids, containing the three specific motifs of α <dig> -fucosyltranferase in the catalytic domain . comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of the human and pig orthologs, shows 94% and 88% identity, respectively.

in order to conclusively confirm that the yb2/ <dig> cloned fut <dig> cdna encodes an active α <dig> -fucosyltransferase, the cdna was inserted in pcdna <dig>  expression vector. the construction was transiently transfected into cos- <dig> cells.  <dig> h after transfection, the α <dig> -fucosyltransferase activity was measured in cell extracts using asialo-agalacto apotransferrin as acceptor substrate for in vitro assays. the α <dig> -fucosyltransferase activity was  <dig> times higher  in pcdna-fut <dig> transfected cos- <dig> cell extracts than in the control cells , confirming that the cloned cdna encodes an active enzyme.

fluorescence in situ hybridization
copy number of fut <dig> gene was counted on at least  <dig> interphase nuclei of yb2/ <dig> cell line and appropriated controls. results are summarized as percentage and mean copy number in table  <dig> and representative pictures of the different samples are shown in figure  <dig>  it appears that the rat myeloma cell line yb2/ <dig> has a mean copy number of fut <dig> gene of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  whereas the rat primary lymphocyte has only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of the same gene and the negative control with the nrp shows no hybridization. these differences are statistically significant with p <  <dig> .

the number of copies of fut <dig> gene observed by fish is expressed as a percentage of cells.

b: not detected

c: non relevant probe

identification of rat fut <dig> transcription start sites
to determine the transcriptional start sites  of rat fut <dig> gene, the mrna 5'-ends were amplified by rlm-race. to ascertain to only amplify full-length transcripts, we first selected full-length capped mrna from total rna extracted from yb2/ <dig> cells. for that purpose, total rna was first treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase for total dephosphorylation of uncapped rnas, thereafter the full-length mrna was uncapped with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. the generacer rna oligonucleotide was then ligated to the 5'-phosphate of the uncapped mrna using t <dig> rna ligase. reverse transcription was performed with the generacer oligodt primer, followed by a first pcr using the forward generacer5'primer provided and the reverse gene-specific primer 3f8race <dig> located at the 5'-end of exon e <dig>  nested pcr was performed with the forward generacer5'primer nested provided and the reverse gene-specific primer 3f8race <dig> located into the first coding exon e <dig>  as shown in figure 4a, which is representative of at least three independent amplifications, four bands from  <dig> to  <dig> bp were obtained. the pcr products were subcloned, sequenced and blast-aligned http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ against the rat genome. as expected, the amplified products were assigned to rat fut <dig> transcripts  excepted for the  <dig> bp band, which was not specific. three different 5'-ends of fut <dig> mrna were identified, testifying the existence of three transcript isoforms. the t <dig> transcript  corresponding to the  <dig> bp amplified fragment, is extended by  <dig> bp from the atg and composed of  <dig> exons named e- <dig>  e- <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> as shown in figure 4b. twenty different clones from three independent rlm-race were sequenced, defining  <dig> tss for t <dig>  at - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> bp from the atg . the t <dig> transcript , corresponding to the  <dig> bp amplified product, is extended by about  <dig> bp and composed, as well, of the exons e- <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> but the exon e- <dig> is substituted by exon e- <dig>  the sequencing of  <dig> clones allowed the identification of six tss at position - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> bp from the atg . finally, the t <dig> transcript  was the smallest one and corresponded to the  <dig> bp product. the t <dig> transcript 5'-untranslated region was only composed of the 3'-end of exon e <dig>  with  <dig> tss at position - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> from the atg . a schematic representation of the 5'-untranslated region of fut <dig> gene and of the three transcript isoforms identified by rlm-raceis shown in figure  <dig>  similar results were obtained for rat <dig> cells and rat liver rna preparations, excepted for t <dig> transcript, the presence of which was not confirmed in both cases.

quantification of transcripts in cultured cells by duplex taqman™ qpcr
the relative expression of fut <dig> specific transcripts was determined by duplex taqman™ qpcr using hprt as a normalizing gene. for t <dig> transcript, a forward primer hybridizing within e- <dig> and a reverse primer that hybridizes within the exon e-1/e- <dig> junction of fut <dig> cdna sequence were designed . for the t <dig> transcript, the primers pair was designed hybridizing within e- <dig> sequence for the forward primer and in the exon e- <dig> for the reverse primer. taqman™ probes were designed within exon e- <dig> and e- <dig>  respectively. for hprt, primers and probe were designed to hybridize within exon 7/exon  <dig> sequences of the coding region . the relative expression of specific transcripts was determined for yb2/ <dig> and rat <dig> cell lines. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of t <dig> transcript was  <dig> -fold higher than the expression of t <dig>  this pattern of expression was similar in both cell lines .

the direct quantification of t <dig> transcript expression was not possible because the totality of the 5'-utr sequence is common to the sequences of the t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts. moreover, the quantification of the total transcripts of fut <dig> using primers designed in e- <dig> and e <dig> exons didn't allow determining the expression level of t <dig>  nevertheless, the t <dig> transcript appeared to be weakly expressed in both cell lines compared to t <dig> and t <dig> 

promoter activity of the 5'-upstream region of t <dig> and t2
to determine the minimal promoter region of the t <dig> transcript, the  <dig> kb genomic sequence between e- <dig> and e- <dig> was subcloned in the pgl3b upstream the luciferase gene and named pgl <dig>  this plasmid and the 5'- or 3'-deleted constructions pgl <dig>  pgl <dig>  pgl <dig>  pgl <dig>  pgl <dig>  pgl <dig>  pgl <dig> and pgl <dig>  were transfected into yb2/ <dig> and rat <dig> cells for luciferase assays. unfortunately, the luminescence intensity measured in yb2/ <dig> for these different constructions was too weak to allow determining the promoter activity of this region in this cell line. the results obtained for rat <dig> are presented in figure  <dig>  and show a 13-fold increase of luciferase activity for the full length plasmid pgl <dig> compared to pgl3b, whereas the luciferase activity for pgl <dig> and pgl <dig> constructs shows a 38- and 30-fold increased activity, respectively. in parallel, luciferase activity for the pgl <dig> and pgl <dig> plasmids show only a 3- and 4-fold increased activity compared to pgl3b. these data suggest the existence of a minimal promoter region   within the sequence -892/- <dig>  including positive and negative regulation regions in -892/- <dig> and 598/- <dig>  respectively. in addition, the -1205/- <dig> and -451/- <dig> sequences include positive regulation regions, whereas -1104/- <dig> sequence includes negative regulation regions.

we also analyzed the  <dig> kb region located upstream the e- <dig> exon with or without e- <dig> sequence to determine the minimal promoter region controlling the transcription of t <dig> transcript. the full length region with the e- <dig> region was pcr amplified and subcloned in the pgl3b upstream the luciferase gene and named pgl <dig>  this plasmid, or 5'- or 3'-deleted constructions were transiently transfected in rat <dig> cells. all the constructions increase the luciferase activity compared to pgl3b. the results presented in figure  <dig> show a 7- to 11-fold increase of luciferase activity for the constructions without the e- <dig> exon, whereas the luciferase activity for constructs with e- <dig> exon shows a 28- and 36-fold increased activity. no significant differences in luciferase activity were observed between the pgl <dig>  pgl <dig> and pgl <dig> constructions. these results suggest the existence of a minimal promoter region   within the sequence -720/- <dig> upstream the atg and a positive regulation region in the exon e- <dig> 

bioinformatics analysis of p <dig> and p <dig> minimal promoter regions
the putative minimal promoter regions upstream exons e- <dig> and e- <dig> were analyzed with matinspector  <dig>  http://www.genomatix.de using transac matrices  <dig>   <cit> . lymphoid and myeloid cell-specific filters were applied to sort the identified transcription factors consensus sequences and core similarity was fixed at 95%. a particular attention was put on consensus sequences for transcription factors with repressor activity, potentially usable for the control of fucosylation in yb2/ <dig>  results of these bioinformatics analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  in both cases, the analyses did not reveal any canonical tata or caat boxes, but several putative binding sites for general transcription factors and for transcription factors with repressor activity. for the p <dig> minimal promoter region  controlling the transcription of t <dig> transcript, consensus sequences for the putative repressors mzf <dig> , pax <dig> , klf <dig> , irf <dig>  and prdm <dig>  were identified . for the p <dig> minimal promoter region, we identified potential repressor binding sites for helt , cdp , mel <dig> , nkx <dig>  , ikrs  and the zinc-finger transcription factor gfi- <dig> 

effect of klf <dig> over-expression on the p <dig> minimal promoter activity
in order to determine the effect of the potential repressor transcription factors on minimal promoter p <dig> activity, we co-transfected rat <dig> cells with mzf <dig>  pax <dig>  klf <dig>  irf <dig> or prdm <dig> expression vectors and with reporter vector pgl <dig> containing the minimal promoter p <dig> sequence.  <dig> hours after transfection, luciferase assays were performed and showed that only klf <dig> was able to reduce the minimal promoter activity of t <dig> transcript by about 50%, at each concentration of vector tested . these results were statistically significant  and suggested that klf <dig> had repressor activity. a similar repressor effect of klf <dig> was observed on the on pgl <dig> construct . the over-expression of klf <dig> protein was checked by western blot in nucleus and cytoplasm fractions of rat <dig> cells. as shown in figure 10a, the anti-klf <dig> mab revealed two bands at about  <dig> kda, in agreement with the apparent molecular weight of klf <dig> protein in sds-page  <cit> . endogenous klf <dig> was mainly present in the cytosolic fraction  and the amount of klf <dig> protein increased in both in nucleus and cytoplasm fractions with the concentration of transfected vector in a dose-dependent manner. at the lowest concentration of vector, klf <dig> is mainly over-expressed in the nucleus fraction and the repression of luciferase activity for higher concentrations of vector doesn't change in spite of the increase of the protein in both fractions. these data indicate that the smallest quantity of klf <dig> that accumulates in the nucleus is sufficient to observe a maximal repressor effect.

binding of nuclear proteins to p <dig> minimal promoter sequence
to investigate the association between nuclear proteins and the  p <dig> minimal promoter sequence, emsa assay was performed to determine whether rat <dig> cells nuclear proteins could bind this sequence. as shown in figure 10c, a strong band was shifted  when the nuclear extract was incubated with the biotinylated dna fragment. the shifted band was significantly inhibited by a molar excess of unlabeled competitor. in order to further determine if klf <dig> binds to the promoter sequence, super-shift assay was performed using anti-klf <dig> mab but no supplementary band was detected. this result indicates that klf <dig> may not directly interact with the minimal promoter sequence.

discussion
the rat hybridoma cell line yb2/ <dig> is considered as an alternative for the large-scale production of low fucose igg  <cit> . the fucose transfer capacity of yb2/ <dig> is much lower than the other rodent cell lines commonly used  <cit> . however, the amount of fucose-negative antibody produced by yb2/ <dig> significantly decreased with the culture, due to the elevation of fut <dig> expression by the yb2/ <dig> cells  <cit> . important variations of the fucose content are also observed in production culture conditions.

to improve our knowledge of yb2/ <dig> fucosylation machinery, we have cloned rat fut <dig> cdna. fut <dig> gene coding region spans over  <dig> kb of rat chromosome  <dig> and splits into nine coding exons with an organization closely related to that of the human ortholog  <cit> . the rat fut <dig> cdna contains an orf of  <dig> bp, encoding a  <dig> amino acids polypeptide, showing 94% and 88% identity with the human and porcine enzymes, respectively. the amino acids sequence contains the three specific motifs of α <dig> -fucosyltranferase in the catalytic domain . these motifs are shared by α2-fucosyltransferases, α6-fucosyltransferases, and protein-o-fucosyltransferases , indicating that the corresponding genes have originated from a common ancestor by duplication and divergent evolution  <cit> .

interestingly, we identified  <dig> nucleotide changes in the coding sequence of rat fut <dig> cdna when compared to the putative sequence . two of these snp were also found in different est sequences of the ncbi databases, showing the existence of a silent allelic polymorphism in rat gene, but without change in the amino-acid sequence of the polypeptide.

by fish, we were able to determine the copy number of fut <dig> gene in yb2/ <dig>  showing a heterogeneous cell population, 60% of cells having three fut <dig> copies and  <dig> % with  <dig> or more copies, the mean copy number being  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . hybridoma cell lines such as yb2/ <dig> are usually tetraploid but are also genetically instable. depending on the culture medium, continuous cultivation induces chromosome rearrangements and loss of genetic material  <cit>  that can explain fut <dig> heterogeneity. even if other parameters dependent on the culture conditions may also influence fut <dig> expression during the cultivation, the heterogeneity of fut <dig> copy number should also have important consequences in fucosylation capacity of these cells.

rlm-race experiments with capped rnas allowed to define for the first time the organization of the 5'-untranslated region of rat fut <dig> gene and to identify the different tss. the rat fut <dig> gene 5'-untranslated region contains  <dig> exons spanning about  <dig> kb. three mrna isoforms were identified, arising from alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage, as shown in figure  <dig>  the quantification of t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts relative expression was performed by duplex taqman™ qpcr, showing that t <dig> transcript was  <dig> -fold higher expressed than the t <dig>  this pattern of expression was similar in both yb2/ <dig> and rat <dig> cell lines. several tss were identified for each transcript, which is a common attribute for tata-less promoter  <cit> . data concerning fut <dig> 5'-untranslated region and transcripts expression are rather limited. it has been shown that in the human sk-ov- <dig> ovarian cancer cells, fut <dig> expression is controlled by the 5'-flanking region upstream exon  <dig>  however, other 5'-untranslated sequences were found in ests, suggesting the presence of additional exons upstream exon  <dig>  and that the transcription of the gene would be regulated by multiple promoters  <cit> . two additional 5'-untranslated exons were identified upstream human fut <dig> exon  <dig>  which are expressed during embryogenesis as three groups of transcripts, suggesting an expression of fut <dig> regulated by three different promoters  <cit> . from these data, it appears that rat and human fut <dig> genes have a quite similar organization and pattern of expression, with at least three different transcripts encoding the same polypeptide.

the alternative first exons e- <dig> and e- <dig> are located about  <dig> kbp from the first coding exon e <dig> and separated by a  <dig> kbp intronic sequence. the  <dig> kbp rat genomic sequences upstream exons e- <dig> and e- <dig> were cloned in the pgl3b upstream the luciferase gene to determine the minimal promoter regions controlling the transcription of t <dig> and t <dig>  these plasmids and 5'- or 3'-deleted constructions were transfected into yb2/ <dig> and rat <dig> cells for luciferase assays. however, the ratio of luminescence intensity for these different constructions compared to the control pgl3b was too low to allow determining the promoter activity in yb2/ <dig>  nevertheless, we were able to delimitate the minimal promoter regions controlling the expression of both transcripts in rat <dig> cells. we could show that the t <dig> transcript is controlled by a minimal promoter region within the sequence -892/- <dig> from atg with two negative regulation regions within the -451/- <dig> and -1438/- <dig> sequences. the binding of rat <dig> cells nuclear proteins to the p <dig> minimal promoter region was confirmed by emsa analysis. we also showed the existence of a minimal promoter region within the sequence -720/- <dig> upstream the atg for transcript t <dig> and a strong positive regulation region in the exon e- <dig>  few are known about the promoters of fut <dig> in other species. only one study has shown that in human ovarian cancer cells sk-ov- <dig>  luciferase reporter assay indicated that the  <dig> kbp 5'-flanking region of exon e <dig> conferred the promoter activity. this region contains a tata-box, but not a ccaat motif, and potential binding sites for some transcription factors, such as bhlh, cmyb and gata- <dig>  <cit> .

bioinformatics analysis of the promoter regions did not reveal any canonical tata or caat boxes, but several putative binding sites for general transcription factors. absence of tata or caat boxes is a common feature of glycosyltransferase genes  <cit> . it is also in agreement with the presence of several tss for the three transcripts, which is usual for such promoter regions. we also identified in both minimal promoter sequences several binding sites for transcription factors with repressor activity, which could be interesting targets to regulate fut <dig> in yb2/ <dig>  mzf <dig> , pax <dig> , klf <dig> , irf <dig>  and prdm <dig>  consensus sequences have been identified in p <dig> promoter. mzf <dig> is known to regulate transcription of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis of myeloid cells. it is described as a repressor in non-hematopoietic cells and activator in hematopoietic cells  <cit> . pax <dig> is known to down-regulate genes implicated in myeloid or t-lymphocyte differentiation in pro- b lymphocytes  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown that fut <dig> is up-regulated in pax5-/- cells  <cit> . klf <dig> has been demonstrated as a repressor of several important genes such the adrenomodullin gene in adipocytes  <cit>  or the rhodopsin and the irbp  genes  <cit> . irf <dig> is described as a repressor of rxrα, which is a key partner for number of nuclear receptors  <cit> . prdm <dig>  is known to repress several critical genes in b lymphocytes such as c-myc  <cit> . helt , cdp , mel <dig> , nkx <dig>  , ikrs  and the zinc-finger transcription factor gfi- <dig> were also identified in minimal promoter p <dig>  helt was shown to act as a transcriptional repressor in the neuronal development  <cit> . cdp is known to interact with regulatory element from a large number of genes involved in differentiation, cell growth and development. it is acting as a repressor by either a direct repressing effect when stably bound to the promoter, or by competing with activator factors for the occupancy of their binding sites  <cit> . mel <dig> is described to have an essential function in the proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . mel <dig> is also known as a transcription repressor factor in the regulation of calreticulin expression, acting as a competitor with gata <dig> factor  <cit> . nkx <dig>  is a homeodomain transcription factor, described as a transcriptional inhibitor of estrogen receptor activity, acting as a putative repressor in hormone-driven tumors  <cit> . ikrs factors are zinc finger dna binding proteins. six isoforms of ikaros are described that often act as repressors. they seem to have a regulation role in the lymphocyte ontogeny  <cit> . gfi- <dig> is described as a transcriptional repressor in lymphoid cell but its function can change with the cell context in hematopoietic development  <cit> .

these transcriptional repressors can potentially bind to the fut <dig> minimal promoter regions and, in a first approach to control fut <dig> expression, the identified putative repressors of t <dig> transcript were co-transfected in rat <dig> cells with reporter vector pgl <dig> containing the minimal promoter p <dig> sequence. no repressor activity was observed with mzf <dig>  pax <dig>  irf <dig> or prdm <dig>  in particular, we were not able to confirm the repressor activity of pax <dig>  as previously demonstrated in pax5-/- cells  <cit> . however, klf <dig> expression induced a 50% decrease of luciferase activity, whatever the concentration of vector. western blot analysis of transfected cell lysates using anti-klf <dig> mab revealed two bands around  <dig> kda. whereas the theoretical molecular weight of klf <dig> is about  <dig> kda, this is in agreement with the apparent molecular weight of klf <dig> protein previously observed in sds-page  <cit> . the  <dig> kda difference between the two bands could be also explained by a post-translational modification such as sumoylation, as it has been demonstrated for klf <dig>  another transcription factor of krüppel like family  <cit> . western blot showed that klf <dig> is constitutively expressed in rat <dig> cells, mainly in the cytosolic fraction, and increased in both nucleus and cytoplasm fractions with the concentration of transfected klf <dig> expression vector in a dose-dependent manner. at the lowest concentration of vector, klf <dig> is mainly over-expressed in the nucleus fraction. this is enough to observe a maximal repressor effect. this result indicates that a low expression of klf <dig> in the nucleus results in a repression of the p <dig> minimal promoter activity.

CONCLUSIONS
the rat hybridoma cell line yb2/ <dig> is potentially an alternative for the large-scale production of low fucose igg because of lower fucose transfer capacity compared to the other rodent cell lines commonly used. however, nothing was known about the rat α <dig> -fucosyltransferase. our results shed light on the fut <dig> gene organization and expression. even if many other parameters such as gdp-fuc concentration and transport or cell culture conditions can influence the fucosylation capacity of the cells, the heterogeneity of fut <dig> copy number in yb2/ <dig> could explain at least in part the variation of fucose content in igg producing cell populations and impedes efficient gene knockdown strategy. alternatively, the presence of potential repressor binding sequences in the minimal promoter regions of fut <dig> could offer possible alternatives to control the fucosylation of igg produced in these cells.
