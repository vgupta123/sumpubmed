BACKGROUND
paracoccidioides brasiliensis and paracoccidioides lutzii are the etiological agents of paracoccidioidomycosis, an endemic, systemic mycosis in latin america, with the highest prevalence in brazil , where the southeast and south regions report most of the cases  <cit> . it is the eighth highest cause of death among infectious and parasitic diseases and has the highest mortality rate, up to 59 %, between systemic mycosis in brazil in endemic areas .

the infection occurs through the inhalation of conidia of the mycelial form. once inside the host, the fungus undergoes a transition to the yeast form, also known as the parasitic form, via temperature stimulation  <cit> . however, the establishment of the infection depends on several factors, such as the host immune system, the ability of the fungus to evade it and establish itself in the hostile environment provided by the host. in this way paracoccidioides spp. synthesize several substances that may cause damage in the host cells and assist in colonization .

an important feature in the host-pathogen interaction is the adhesion process, which contributes to pathogen colonization, dissemination and evasion of the host immune system  <cit> . several adhesins that allow the fungus to bind the host extracellular matrix  have already been described for paracoccidioides spp.  <cit> . among these, 14-3- <dig> protein plays an important role in paracoccidioides-host interaction.

the 14-3- <dig> protein from p. brasiliensis, termed pb14-3- <dig>  belongs to the 14-3- <dig> protein family, and it is composed of approximately 30 kda acidic dimeric proteins that have already been described in all eukaryotes and are involved in many cellular processes .

the pb14-3- <dig> protein was first described as an adhesin and a laminin ligand  <cit>  and it was identified in p. brasiliensis extracellular vesicles  <cit> . da silva et al.  <cit>  demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo models that during infection, an accumulation of this protein occurred in the fungal cell wall. additionally, the recombinant protein promoted a decrease in the adhesion rate of p. brasiliensis to epithelial cells.

in a study conducted by de oliveira et al.  <cit>  the expression of adhesins genes and adhesion profile of both p. brasiliensis and p. lutzii were compared during interaction with mice and they observed that in both species pb14-3- <dig> gene is up-regulated, showing that this protein plays an important role in the host-pathogen interaction in both paracoccidioides species.

recently, da silva et al.  <cit>  evaluated the pneumocytes response when treated with gp <dig> and pb14-3- <dig>  the cells exhibited the same profile of apoptosis signaling observed during p. brasiliensis infection, highlighting the importance of this protein during the interaction with the host.

saccharomyces cerevisiae has two encoding genes, bmh <dig> and bmh <dig>  for 14-3- <dig> proteins  that are involved in innumerable processes, such as sporulation, ergosterol metabolism-related gene transcription and chitin synthesis .

although advances in the genetic manipulation of p. brasiliensis have been made, saccharomyces cerevisiae is still extensively used for genetic studies, including functional analyses, due its ease of use and the wide range of available information.  thus, we chose this yeast as our model to evaluate the role of the pb14-3- <dig> and its relationship with the pathogenicity of p. brasiliensis.

RESULTS
primary sequence alignment of 14-3- <dig> proteins
as previously described, s. cerevisiae has two 14-3- <dig> isoforms, bmh1p  and bmh2p   <cit> . therefore, using the clustalw <dig> amino acid sequence, an analysis was performed between them and pb14-3- <dig> , and a high identity was found among these proteins: bmh1p and pb14-3- <dig> presented an identity of 76 %, and bmh2p and pb14-3- <dig> presented an identity of 80 % .fig.  <dig> primary sequence analysis. an “*”  indicates positions that have a single, fully conserved residue; a “:”  indicates conservation between groups with strongly similar properties - scoring >  <dig>  in the gonnet pam  <dig> matrix; a “.”  indicates conservation between groups of weakly similar properties - scoring = <  <dig>  in the gonnet pam  <dig> matrix. the code of colors according to their physicochemical properties are as follows: red, small and hydrophobic ; blue, acidic ; magenta, basic ; and green, 



molecular cloning of pb14-3- <dig> gene and bmh1
the heterologous expression of pb14-3- <dig> in s. cerevisiae was carried out using p. brasiliensis cdna to amplify the pb14-3- <dig> orf  , followed by cloning into pyes <dig> vector. as a control, these procedures were performed using bmh <dig> orf  because it is the predominantly expressed isoform in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . after cloning confirmation  and sequence analysis, the obtained plasmids, pyes-14-3- <dig> and pyes-bmh <dig>  and the empty plasmid, pyes, were transformed into wild type , Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae strains using the lithium acetate method for yeast transformation. the positive transformants were selected on sd-ura  plates.fig.  <dig> agarose gel electrophoresis. a confirmation of pb14-3- <dig> orf amplification:  1 kb ladder and  pb14-3- <dig> orf . b restriction diagnosis:  1 kb ladder;  <dig> – pyes-14-3- <dig>   restriction products using bamh <dig> and xhoi , and  restriction products using bamhi and hindiii ,  100 bp ladder



complementation assay
to evaluate the ability of pb14-3- <dig> to complement bmh1p or bmh2p function in the Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae mutants or to improve the functions of these proteins in the wt s. cerevisiae, we performed a spot test using fluconazole  35 μm as described in the materials and methods. the pb14-3- <dig> promoted a decrease in fluconazole susceptibility, and a higher complementation was observed in the Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae mutant, probably due to the higher identity of pb14-3- <dig> with bmh2p from s. cerevisiae .fig.  <dig> evaluation of complementation. a spot assay was used to evaluate susceptibility to fluconazole 35 μm in wt , Δbmh <dig>  and Δbmh <dig>  s. cerevisiae transformants. there was a decreased sensitivity of transformants pyes-14-3- <dig> and pyes-bmh <dig> compared with the empty vector transformant . as a growth control, the transformants were also spotted in sd-ura without fluconazole



in addition, as fluconazole acts in ergosterol biosynthesis, there is evidence that pb14-3- <dig> may be involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, as found with s. cerevisiae bmh1/ <dig> proteins  <cit> .

expression analysis of genes related to ergosterol pathway
in order to test our hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in ergosterol pathway by real time pcr. bmh1p and bmh2p influence in ergosterol pathway have already been described and downregulation of erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig> and hes <dig> genes were observed in s. cerevisiae bmh1/ <dig> mutants  <cit> . in this sense, those genes were chosen to evaluate the possible role of pb14-3- <dig> in ergosterol pathway.

an increase of expression of all evaluated genes was observed in the three s. cerevisiae transformants containing pyes-bmh <dig> and pyes-14-3- <dig> when compared to the s. cerevisiae pyes.transformants . the expression analysis showed an increased expression of all genes in the wt and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae containing pyes-14-3- <dig> when compared to the pyes-bmh <dig> transformants, with a significant increase for erg <dig>  erg <dig> and hes <dig>  in Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-14-3- <dig> a slight increase is observed for erg <dig> and hes <dig> genes. these data demonstrate that pb14-3- <dig> is also involved in ergosterol pathway by altering the expression of these genes.fig.  <dig> relative gene expression of genes involved in ergosterol pathway. relative gene expression of erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig> and hes <dig> in  wt s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-bmh <dig> and pyes-14-3- <dig>   Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-bmh <dig> and pyes-14-3- <dig> and  Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-bmh <dig> and pyes-14-3- <dig>   indicates a statistically significant difference in expression level, p <  <dig> . the graph show the normalized gene expression relative to wt, Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes , respectively



in addition, it seems like bmh1p has a higher influence in this pathway, once erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig> and hes <dig> showed a higher expression in Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae containing pyes-bmh <dig>  which have the bmh <dig> gene and the plasmid, than Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae, which expression of bmh1p occurs only through the plasmid.

adhesion assay
pb14-3- <dig> was identified in our group as an adhesin, hence, we performed an adhesion assay to evaluate the ability of pb14-3- <dig> to induce s. cerevisiae adherence to epithelial cells .

a significant increase in adhesion was only observed in wt s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-14-3- <dig>  showing that pb14-3- <dig> acts as an adhesin even in a non-pathogenic fungus. however, bmh1p did not promote the increase of the adhesion rate, suggesting a differential role of pb14-3- <dig> .fig.  <dig> adhesion assay. a adhesion rate of wt, Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes ,  adhesion rate of wt, Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-bmh <dig> and the  adhesion rate of wt, Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-14-3- <dig>   indicates a statistically significant difference in adhesion rate, p <  <dig> 



in Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformants with pyes14-3- <dig> or pyesbmh <dig> no increase of adhesion rate was observed, although it was unexpected, the pb-14-3- <dig> may be acting in bmh1p or bmh2p primary functions in order to compensate the lack of missing genes, meanwhile wt s. cerevisiae possess both genes and pb14-3- <dig> can be required for secondary functions, as adhesin .

discussion
as with many pathogens, paracoccidioides spp. adhesion to host cells is a crucial event in the establishment of disease and contributes to the colonization and invasion of host cells, as well as evasion from the host immune system  <cit> . therefore, paracoccidioides adhesins are important proteins to be studied because they might promote a better understanding of fungal pathogenesis and provide new targets for antifungals.

several paracoccidioides spp. adhesins have already been described, such as the 43 kda glycoprotein, gp <dig>  which is most studied paracoccidioides spp. adhesin that binds to laminin and fibronectin and is also used as a serological marker ; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase , enolase , triose phosphate isomerase , malate synthase , aconitase  and isocitrate lyase , which, in addition to their primary roles in the metabolism, are found in the fungal cell wall and are able to bind to different components of the ecm ; and the 30 kda protein identified as the 14-3- <dig> protein, which stands out in paracoccidioides – host interaction  <cit> .

the 14-3- <dig> proteins comprise a family of small, dimeric and acidic proteins that are present in all eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the closest relation between 14-3- <dig> protein and fungus virulence was first described by andreotti et al.  <cit> , where they found an increase in the expression of a 30 kda protein after animal reisolation and that this 30 kda protein binds to laminin and it is able to inhibit p. brasiliensis adhesion and invasion in epithelial cells. later, da silva et al.  <cit>  identified this protein as being related to a member of the 14-3- <dig> protein family and demonstrated that pb14-3- <dig> accumulates in the fungal cell wall during infection in both in vitro and in vivo models.

as genetic manipulation of p. brasiliensis are still hard to accomplish  <cit> , we decided to use s. cerevisiae as a model to improve our knowledge about pb14-3- <dig>  the double knockout of bmh <dig> and bmh <dig> genes are lethal  <cit> , then we decided to evaluate pb14-3- <dig> function in single mutant and wild type strains of s. cerevisiae, a strategy successfully used by clapp et al.  <cit> .

as the first description of pb14-3- <dig> was as an adhesin, we performed an adhesion assay to evaluate the ability of pb-14-3- <dig> to promote s. cerevisiae adhesion to pneumocytes. a significant increase in the adhesion rate was observed for wt s. cerevisiae transformed with pyes-14-3- <dig>  but not with pyes-bmh <dig> and pyes. however, this was not observed in any transformed s. cerevisiae mutants .

in this way, as s. cerevisiae is a non-pathogenic microorganism the adhesion process is not required to the yeast, therefore, when Δbmh <dig> and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae express pb14-3- <dig>  the protein is recruited to perform the primary functions of the missing gene, bmh <dig> and bmh <dig>  respectively, as it occurs with the bmh1p and bmh <dig> proteins  <cit> . however, in the wt s. cerevisiae transformants there is no need to supplement any function and the protein expressed through the plasmid perform secondary function and act as adhesin. interesting, only wt s. cerevisiae pyes-14-3- <dig> showed an increase in adhesin rate compared to the wt s. cerevisiae pyes suggesting although the high identity, pb14-3- <dig> may present different functions than bmh1p, such as an adhesin.

although 14-3- <dig> proteins are multifunctional proteins that are involved in several cellular processes  <cit> , which may have influenced the adhesion of s. cerevisiae, the pb14-3- <dig> role in adhesion process during paracoccidioides spp. interaction with host cells in vitro and in vivo have already been demonstrated  <cit> . additional role of conserved proteins in pathogenic organisms, including paracoccidioides spp., during interaction with host cells has already been described. enzymes from glycolytic pathway, tricarboxylic cycle and glyoxylate cycle are found in fungus cell wall during infection and are able to interact with ecm components, assisting in the fungus adherence  <cit> .

in humans, this protein has been widely study as a target for drug development or as a biomarker  because it has been associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as creutzfeldt-jakob disease, alzheimer’s disease  <cit>  and some cancer types  <cit>  .

however, the knowledge of the influence of 14-3- <dig> proteins in pathogenic fungi is still limited. candida albicans encodes a single 14-3- <dig> gene, bmh <dig>  <cit> , which the expressed protein is involved in growth and filamentation that may affect the host-fungus interaction  <cit> . it was also recognized by c. albicans germ-tube-specific antibodies in the detection of invasive candidiasis, highlighting the potential as a biomarker for diagnosis  <cit> .

the 14-3- <dig> proteins of some parasites have also been studied in regards their involvement in infectious diseases  <cit> . in trypanosoma brucei, 14-3- <dig> proteins were related to cell motility, cytokinesis and the cell cycle  <cit> ; the 14-3- <dig> protein from toxoplasma gondii seems to stimulate the host immune system and is a promising vaccine candidate  <cit> . several studies of 14-3- <dig> proteins from the genus ecchinococcus suggest the importance of this protein in host-parasite interactions, where it can be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and invasion, as well as in the modulation of the host immune system . the same behavior was also verified in 14-3- <dig> proteins from the genus schistosoma and studies have been conducted to development of vaccines and diagnostic methods .

in aspergillus nidulans, the expression of 14-3- <dig> protein was also identified and seems to be involved in hyphae morphogenesis as its overexpression promoted defects in the establishment of the germ tube and asexual development  <cit> .

in this study, we also demonstrated that pb14-3- <dig> could partially complement the functions of bmh1p and bmh2p by decreasing the susceptibility to fluconazole at 35 μm, showing a greater complementation in the mutant s. cerevisiae Δbmh <dig>  which was expected because according to the amino acid alignment analysis, we observed a higher identity between pb14-3- <dig> and bmh2p than between pb14-3- <dig> and bmh1p.

in addition, it is well known that in azoles, such as fluconazole, the mechanism of action takes place in ergosterol biosynthesis by interrupting the conversion of lanosterol into  <dig> -dimethylcholesta- <dig> ,24-trienol  <cit> .

thus, we hypothesized if pb14-3- <dig> may be related to ergosterol biosynthesis due to the decreased sensibility of the s. cerevisiae strains transformed with pyes-14-3- <dig>  to verify that, we performed an expression analysis of genes involved in ergosterol pathway, erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig> and hes <dig>  which have already been described to be regulated by bmh1p and bmh2p  <cit> .

the pb14-3- <dig> promoted the up-regulation of all evaluated genes, demonstrating its involvement in ergosterol pathway in this model. in addition, the up-regulation promoted by pb14-3- <dig> was higher than promoted by bmh1p, this was specially observed for the genes erg <dig>  erg <dig> and hes <dig> wt and Δbmh <dig> s. cerevisiae transformants.

ergosterol is the major sterol in fungi and it is an essential structural component of plasma membrane. also, ergosterol acts in membrane permeability and in membrane-bound enzymes  <cit> . in pathogenic fungus ergosterol is a microbe associated molecular pattern and because of the differences between ergosterol and human sterols it is widely study in the development of antifungal compounds .

the currently antifungals used in treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis, itraconazole and amphotericin b, have as target enzymes of ergosterol pathway, such as erg11p, and ergosterol, respectively . the resistance and effect of these antifungals in pathogenic fungi have been studied , da silva neto et al  <cit> , studied the transcriptional profile of paracoccidioides treated with itraconazole and observed an up-regulation of genes from ergosterol biosynthesis.

the ergosterol biosynthesis is performed by genes from erg family. erg <dig> and erg <dig> genes encode essential enzymes in the initial stages of ergosterol biosynthesis, acting in the conversion of squalene into squalene epoxide and of lanosterol into  <dig> -dimethylcholesta- <dig> ,24-trienol, respectively. erg28p seems to be a key enzyme in the ergosterol biosynthesis, once interacts with seven ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes, where the association with erg11p, erg27p, erg25p and erg6p are more closely and with erg1p and erg26p are less associated  <cit> . hes <dig> is related to ergosterol biosynthesis and sterol transport  <cit> .

the role of paracoccidioides spp. in adhesion process and this new role here described, in ergosterol biosynthesis, reinforce the importance of this protein in host-pathogen interactions and its potential as therapeutic target.

CONCLUSIONS
these findings corroborate results presented in previous studies. here, we demonstrated that pb14-3- <dig> acts as an adhesin, even in a non-pathogenic model. this protein has adhesin function unlike bmh1p, despite the high identity between these proteins.

the influence of pb14-3- <dig> in ergosterol pathway was also demonstrated in this model and we believe that also happens in paracoccidioides spp.. further studies should be conducted in order to evaluate this new function of pb14-3- <dig> and its implications in paracoccidioides spp. pathogenesis and virulence. however, this highlights the importance of this protein and its potential as therapeutic target against paracoccidioides spp..
