BACKGROUND
the development of skeletal muscle proceeds through five phases, as follows  <cit> : phase  <dig> , muscle progenitor cells are specified to become muscle cells in somites; phase  <dig> , the muscle progenitor cells migrate to the presumptive places where muscles are formed; phase  <dig> , the muscle progenitor cells proliferate, increase in number, and become myoblasts; phase  <dig> , the myoblasts fuse to become multinucleated myotubes; phase  <dig> , the multinucleated myotubes mature to myofibers, such as fast-twitch myofibers or slow-twitch myofibers.

bone morphogenetic proteins  are members of the transforming growth factor β  super family and comprise a highly conserved and expanding family of  <dig> genes. bmps were discovered as a factor that induced the ectopic formation of cartilage and bone when implanted intramuscularly in adult rats  <cit> . since then, they have been found to play roles in many biological functions  <cit>  including in the development of skeletal muscle.

in vitro studies using the myogenic cell line c2c <dig> demonstrate that bmp- <dig> converts the developmental pathway of c2c <dig> from a myogenic lineage to an osteoblastic lineage by reducing the activity of the myod family, such as that of myod and myogenin, and by up-regulating inhibitor of dna binding/differentiation  <dig>  and runt-related gene  <dig>   <cit> . this conversion of the developmental pathway of c2c <dig> seems to inhibit myogenic differentiation, including myotube formation. in vivo studies using null mutation mice demonstrate that bmps inhibit the specification of the developmental fate of myogenic progenitor cells: bmps from the lateral plate and dorsal neural tube inhibit the specification in the somites and somitomeres  <cit> , and noggin  suppresses the action of bmps  <cit> . we recently reported that bmps and their receptors are expressed in the myoblasts and myotubes of mouse embryonic tongues which are actively differentiating and maturating, implying that bmps play a role in myoblast differentiation  <cit> .

the tongue is a complex muscular organ comprised of several intrinsic and extrinsic muscles, and is involved in several important physiological tasks, such as suckling, swallowing, mastication, respiration, and vocalization. the tongue muscles constitute a subset of the head muscles, but several lines of evidence indicate that the program governing tongue myogenesis is more similar to those for migratory hypaxial muscles, such as the limb and diaphragm muscles, than to the head muscles, such as the masseter and temporalis muscles  <cit> . we have extensively studied the roles of peptide growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor   <cit>  and hepatocyte growth factor  in the development of tongue muscle cells using an organ culture system of mouse embryonic tongue  <cit> . the organ culture system of mouse embryonic tongue seems to be a good model for studying the genetic program governing migratory hypaxial myogenesis and for relating the results of in vivo studies with those of in vitro studies using established myogenic cell lines such as c2c <dig>  however, the roles of bmps in the phases of differentiation and maturation in skeletal muscles have yet to be fully elucidated. the present study attempts to define the functions of bmp- <dig> in the differentiation phase of myoblasts in mouse embryonic tongue using an organ culture system of embryonic day   <dig> mouse tongue in which the differentiation phase of myoblasts is initiated  <cit> .

RESULTS
recombinant bmp- <dig> had neither inhibitory nor proliferative effects on cultured tongue
to identify possible toxic effects of recombinant bmp- <dig> on cultured tongue, we observed the gross morphology of e <dig> tongues cultured for  <dig> days in bgjb medium containing vehicle  or recombinant bmp- <dig> . no significant difference in the shape or size was observed between the vehicle- and recombinant bmp-2-treated tongue. to estimate the whole tissue volume of the cultured tongues, we measured the expression level of the mrna of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , a house keeping gene . no marked difference was found between the expression level of gapdh mrna stimulated by the vehicle and that stimulated by recombinant bmp- <dig>  suggesting that the recombinant bmp- <dig> had no inhibitory effect on the cultured tongues. furthermore, we analyzed the mrna expression levels of cyclin d <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  , markers for the proliferation of cells, and found no significant difference between the vehicle and recombinant bmp- <dig>  suggesting that recombinant bmp- <dig> did not alter the proliferation of cells in the cultured tongues.

recombinant bmp- <dig> suppressed the differentiation of myoblasts in cultured tongue
to identify the role of bmp- <dig> in the differentiation of tongue myoblasts, we supplemented human recombinant bmp- <dig> in the culture medium and analyzed the mrna expression levels of myod, myogenin, and muscle creatine kinase , markers for muscle differentiation, in the cultured tongue . the ratios of myogenin and mck, a marker for the final stages of muscle differentiation, relative to gapdh in the recombinant bmp-2-treated tongues were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, which were approximately  <dig> and 38% lower than those in the vehicle-treated tongues . no significant difference in the expression level of myod was found between the samples treated with the vehicle and those treated with recombinant bmp- <dig> 

the mean ± standard deviation of six vehicle-treated or six bmp-2-treated tongues for each gene is shown. the ratio of each target gene mrna relative to gapdh mrna is shown.

to further verify whether the recombinant bmp- <dig> suppressed the differentiation of tongue myoblasts in cultured tongues, we analyzed the localization and expression level of myogenin and fast myosin heavy chain  proteins in the recombinant bmp-2- or vehicle-treated tongues by immunohistochemical and western blotting analyses . the number of myogenin-positive cells appeared to be lower in the bmp-2-treated tongue  than in the vehicle-treated tongue . elongated myotubes with multi-nuclei were nearly absent in the bmp-2-treated tongues , whereas they were clearly present in the vehicle-treated tongue . the expression levels of myogenin and fmyhc proteins were lower in the bmp-2-treated tongue than in the vehicle-treated tongue .

recombinant bmp- <dig> did not induce the formation of cartilage and bone in cultured tongue
to determine whether recombinant bmp- <dig> induced the formation of cartilage and bone in the cultured tongue, we analyzed the mrna expression levels of runx <dig>  alkaline phosphatase , collagen ii, and collagen x, which are markers for chondrogenesis and osteogenesis . in the bmp-2-treated tongue, runx <dig> mrna was induced, but the ratio of runx <dig> relative to gapdh was extremely low and approximately 1000-fold lower than those of myogenic markers such as myod, myogenin, and mck. there was no significant difference in the mrna expression levels of osteocalcin, alp, collagen ii, and collagen x between the recombinant bmp- <dig> and vehicle-treated tongues. their ratios relative to gapdh were also extremely low, being approximately 1000-fold lower than those of the myogenic markers, and the variations for measurement were also quite large.

to further determine whether recombinant bmp- <dig> induced the formation of cartilage and bone in the cultured tongue, we stained the cultured tongue using alizarin red  and alcian blue . no alizarin red-positive staining was observed in any sample, but a weak, nearly identical alcian blue-positive staining was observed in both the bmp-2- and vehicle-treated tongues.

suppression of bmp- <dig> expression by sirna had neither inhibitory nor proliferative effects on cultured tongue
the addition of bmp- <dig> sirna to the cultured medium induced an approximately 50% suppression of the expression of bmp- <dig> mrna , but no suppression in bmp- <dig> mrna . the result of immunohistochemical and western blotting analyses indicated that bmp- <dig> sirna induced a marked suppression in the expression of bmp- <dig> protein compared with non-target control rna  . the suppression of bmp- <dig> by sirna induced no significant difference in the gross morphology of the cultured tongue . neither was there a significant difference in the expressions of gapdh , cyclin d <dig> , and cdk <dig>  between the samples treated with ntc and those treated with bmp- <dig> sirna, suggesting that bmp- <dig> sirna had neither inhibitory nor proliferative effects on cultured tongue.

bmp- <dig> sirna stimulated the differentiation of myoblasts in cultured tongue
to determine the role of bmp- <dig> in the differentiation of tongue myoblasts, we analyzed the effect of bmp- <dig> sirna on the mrna expression levels of myod, myogenin, and mck in cultured tongue . the ratios of myogenin and mck relative to gapdh in the bmp- <dig> sirna-treated tongues were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, which were approximately  <dig> and 80% higher than those in the ntc-treated tongues . no significant difference in the expression levels of myod was found between the ntc- and bmp- <dig> sirna-treated cultures.

the mean ± standard deviation of six vehicle-treated or six bmp-2-treated tongues for each gene is shown. the ratio of each target gene mrna relative to gapdh mrna is shown.

to further verify whether bmp- <dig> sirna could stimulate the differentiation of myoblasts in cultured tongues, we analyzed the immunolocalization and expression levels of myogenin and fmyhc proteins in the ntc- and bmp- <dig> sirna-treated tongues . the number of myogenin-positive cells appeared to be higher in the bmp- <dig> sirna-treated tongue  than in the ntc-treated tongue . there were more elongated myotubes with multi-nuclei in the bmp- <dig> sirna-treated tongues  than in the ntc-treated tongue . the expression levels of myogenin and fmyhc proteins were higher in the bmp- <dig> sirna-treated tongue than in the ntc-treated tongue .

suppression of bmp- <dig> expression by sirna did not affect the formation of cartilage and bone in cultured tongue
to elucidate the effect of bmp- <dig> sirna on the formation of cartilage and bone in cultured tongue, we analyzed the mrna expression levels of runx <dig>  osteocalcin, alp, collagen ii, and collagen x, which are markers for chondrogenesis and osteogenesis . neither bmp- <dig> sirna- nor ntc-treated tongue induced detectable levels of runx <dig> mrna. further, there were no significant differences in the mrna expression levels of osteocalcin, alp, collagen ii, and collagen x between the ntc- and bmp- <dig> sirna-treated tongues. their ratios relative to gapdh were also extremely low, being approximately 1000-fold lower than those of the myogenic markers, and the variations for measurement were also large.

neither recombinant bmp- <dig> nor bmp- <dig> sirna altered the expression of id1
since bmp- <dig> suppressed the differentiation of c2c <dig> myogenic cells by reducing the activity of the myod family, such as myod and myogenin, via up-regulation of id <dig>  <cit> , we analyzed the effects of recombinant bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> sirna on the mrna expression levels . we found no marked difference in the mrna expression levels of id <dig> between the vehicle- and recombinant bmp-2-treated tongues, or between the ntc- and bmp- <dig> sirna-treated tongues.

the mean ± standard deviation of six vehicle-treated or six bmp-2-treated tongues for each gene is shown. the ratio of each target gene mrna relative to gapdh mrna is shown.

discussion
in vitro studies using the myogenic cell line c2c <dig> demonstrate that bmp- <dig> converts the developmental pathway of c2c <dig> from a myogenic lineage to an osteoblastic lineage  <cit> , whereas in vivo studies using null mutation mice demonstrate that bmps inhibit the specification of the developmental fate of myogenic progenitor cells  <cit> . however, the roles of bmps in the phases of differentiation and maturation in skeletal muscles have remained elusive. in the present study, recombinant bmp- <dig> suppressed the expressions of markers for the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells in cultured e <dig> tongue, whereas the suppression of bmp- <dig> with sirna stimulated them, suggesting that bmp- <dig> functions as a negative regulator in the final differentiation of tongue myoblasts.

bmps were first discovered as a factor that induced ectopic cartilage formation when implanted intramuscularly in adult rats  <cit> . however, in the present study, the formation of cartilage and bone was not observed in cultured tongue treated with recombinant bmp- <dig>  and neither the recombinant bmp- <dig> nor bmp- <dig> sirna altered the expression of markers for the formation of cartilage and bone, such as osteocalcin, alp, collagen ii, and collagen x. collectively, these results suggest that bmp- <dig> functions as a negative regulator in the final differentiation of tongue myoblasts, but not as an inducer in the formation of cartilage and bone in cultured tongue.

in the present study, the transcriptional levels of chondrogenic and osteogenic markers were approximately 1000-fold lower than those of the myogenic markers, implying that the genes involved in myogenesis are in an activation mode, while the genes involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis are in a silencing mode. there may be several candidate mechanisms to regulate the status of gene expression. it was recently reported that epigenetic regulation, such as via the methylation and acetylation of histone, and the methylation of dna, plays essential roles in the development and regeneration of several kinds of tissues  <cit> . additionally, in the development of skeletal muscle, the transcription of myogenin, myod, and mck is reported to be regulated by the methylation or de-methylation of histone during myogenesis  <cit> . the silencing of genes involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis by epigenetic regulation is a good potential candidate mechanism suggesting that bmp- <dig> does not function as an inducer in the formation of cartilage and bone in cultured e <dig> tongue. to fully elucidate this issue, further studies will be necessary.

in vitro studies using myogenic cell line c2c <dig> demonstrate that bmp- <dig> converts the developmental pathway of c2c <dig> via an elevation in the expression of id <dig> which suppresses the activity of the myod family  <cit> . however, in the present study, the recombinant bmp- <dig> or bmp- <dig> sirna did not induce an alteration in the expression of id <dig>  suggesting the existence of a different pathway for the regulation of tongue striated muscle cells from c2c <dig> myogenic cells. the myod family is known to play an essential role in the development of tongue muscle cells, but there is no report on the function of id <dig> in these cells  <cit> , and the molecular mechanism of the interaction between id <dig> and the myod family during the development of tongue muscle cells remains unknown.

we previously reported several different functions of peptide growth factors in the development of tongue muscle cells from limb and cultured myogenic cell lines: tgfα promotes early differentiation of mouse tongue myoblasts  <cit> , whereas it does not affect the differentiation of the c2c <dig> myoblast  <cit> ; and the signal of tgfβ <dig>  but not of  <dig> or  <dig>  plays a role in the early stages in the differentiation of mouse tongue muscle cells through tgfβ receptor i, tgfβ receptor ii, and smad2/ <dig>  <cit> , but tgfβ <dig> inhibits the differentiation of limb skeletal muscle cells  <cit> . in addition to the function of growth factors, there are several studies showing other differences between tongue muscle cells, and limb and cultured myogenic cell lines, such that fmyhc is expressed not only in the myotubes and myofibers of tongue muscles but also in the myoblasts of tongue muscles, although it is not expressed in the myoblasts of trunk and limb muscles  <cit> . our present result offers support for the theory that the program governing tongue myogenesis is more similar to those for limb and cultured myogenic cell lines than for head muscles, although it still differs from the former.

the coefficients of variance for the mrna expression levels of genes related to myogenesis ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, whereas those for genes related to osteogenesis and chondrogenesis ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. the ratios relative to gapdh of the osteogenic and chondrogenic marker mrnas were extremely low, being approximately 1000-fold lower than those of the myogenic marker mrnas. since these values of the osteogenic and chondrogenic marker mrnas appeared at near the detection limit for real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis, the extreme low level of expression may reflect marked variation.

CONCLUSIONS
in vitro studies using the myogenic cell line c2c <dig> demonstrate that bmp- <dig> converts the developmental pathway of c2c <dig> from a myogenic lineage to an osteoblastic lineage  <cit> , whereas in vivo studies using null mutation mice demonstrate that bmps inhibit the specification of the developmental fate of myogenic progenitor cells  <cit> . in the present study, bmp- <dig> functioned as a negative regulator for the final differentiation of tongue muscle cells, but not as an inducer for the formation of cartilage and bone in cultured e <dig> tongue, probably because the genes related to myogenesis are in an activation mode, while the genes related to chondrogenesis and osteogenesis are in a silencing mode.
