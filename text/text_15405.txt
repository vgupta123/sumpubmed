BACKGROUND
species of conservation concern have arguably the greatest need for genomic tools but can present significant challenges to their development and use. sampling large numbers of individuals or obtaining fresh tissue samples is often impossible when working with at-risk species due to their rarity and protected status  <cit> . the species of interest may also be phylogenetically divergent and lack a closely related reference genome, making genomic annotation and assembly difficult  <cit> . in addition, many at-risk populations will have experienced genetic bottleneck effects, small population size, and inbreeding, which can result in low levels of genetic diversity and strong gametic disequilibrium and make discovery of large numbers of independent polymorphic markers challenging. these difficulties initially slowed the development and use of genomic tools for endangered species, and the full application and power of conservation genomics to improve species management is only now becoming evident . at the same time, the field of genomics has placed emphasis on broad evolutionary comparisons rather than on delineating genomic variation within species. genomic studies often deeply sequence one to three individuals of a single species for use in comparisons among orders or families. conservation management, however, occurs at the population level, with a focus on understanding and maintaining genetic diversity within and between species.

transcriptome sequencing allows elucidation of coding gene sequences without the requirement of deep genome sequencing. next-generation sequencing techniques allow for the collection of mrna sequences from small amounts of tissue in parallel across individuals and species  <cit> , at a depth and coverage that allow de novo transcriptome assembly even in the absence of a closely related genome  <cit> . tissue samples can be collected non-lethally from a single tissue type, such as skin, and still contain sequences from large numbers of genes with diverse functions  <cit> . alternatively, samples from diverse tissues can be taken from individuals that have recently died of natural causes, and still provide enough high quality sequence data to build a transcriptome  <cit> . this provides exciting new possibilities for transcriptome assembly and characterization from rare and endangered species, and thus unprecedented possibilities for marker discovery, gene characterization, and comparative genomics of these species as well.

kiwi  are ratite birds endemic to new zealand. they are of great evolutionary interest because they represent the most basal extant avian lineage  and possess numerous biological attributes that are unusual or extreme among birds. these include large egg size, paired functional ovaries, low metabolic rate, strong olfaction, and lack of color vision  <cit>  as well as flightlessness   <cit> , long lifespan  , and nocturnality   <cit> . kiwi are also of great conservation concern, with four of their five species listed as threatened by the international union for conservation of nature  <cit> . kiwi comprise two clades, the brown and spotted kiwi, which diverged from one another approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the rowi  is a brown kiwi and the rarest kiwi species. they comprise a single population of approximately  <dig> birds that rebounded from a population size of approximately  <dig> birds in the mid 1990’s  <cit> . a third of adult rowi do not breed and annual hatching success in the wild is 16% at best  <cit> . the little spotted kiwi  is the second rarest kiwi species. all extant lsk arose from at most five birds placed on kapiti island approximately  <dig> years ago. despite rapid population growth, lsk are depauperate in genetic diversity at important disease resistance genes  <cit> , show signs of inbreeding depression  <cit> , and continue to experience genetic erosion  <cit> . annual hatching success for wild lsk can be as low as 27%  <cit> . reduced fertility and hatching are often the first signs of inbreeding depression in small, isolated avian populations . thus, poor reproductive success may have an underlying genetic basis in lsk and rowi, potentially exacerbated by the strong genetic drift they experienced during recent genetic bottlenecks  <cit>  and subsequent inbreeding due to small population size  <cit> .

intense conservation measures have been taken with kiwi, including captive incubation, translocation, and predator control programs  <cit> . genomics research could greatly enhance these efforts by providing robust pedigrees, assessing levels of hybridization, investigating possible genotype-phenotype correlations and estimating relatedness and inbreeding coefficients. however, few genomic resources have been available for kiwi until recently  <cit>  and none have sequenced more than three birds representing a single species and sex. indeed, all genomic studies of kiwi to date have focused on the relatively common  and widespread north island brown kiwi   <cit>  without regard to the genetic divergence expected between clades or species.

in this study, we used illumina sequencing to assemble transcriptomes of  <dig> kiwi solely from samples of whole blood. our primary objective was to define suites of functional and neutral genetic markers for brown and spotted kiwi in a single sequencing effort and without having to sacrifice any birds. specifically, we sought to identify  markers in genes of known function that display coding dna sequence variation between species and among individuals,  putatively neutral genetic markers that display dna sequence variation between species and among individuals and  markers in genes that show differential expression between species and sexes. for each species, we assembled  <dig> million paired end reads into approximately  <dig> thousand contigs, of which approximately  <dig> thousand contained predicted coding gene sequences with mean open reading frame  lengths greater than 900bp. we were able to annotate more than half of these orf containing contigs by comparison with sequences in the ncbi non-redundant protein database. in addition, we have catalogued an extensive list of sequence variation, found many genes that are differentially expressed between species and sexes, and identified polymorphic markers within genes related to reproduction, growth, development, behavior, and disease resistance. our results will help delineate the structure, function and expression of kiwi genes, and provide a powerful resource for further studies of kiwi ecology, management, and evolution.

RESULTS
de novo assembly and annotation
we sequenced mrna libraries from the blood of eight lsk and eight rowi using an illumina hiseq and obtained more than  <dig> and  <dig> million paired reads from lsk and rowi, respectively. raw hiseq reads are available at the ncbi short read archive under accession number srp <dig>  while a more comprehensive transcriptome could have been obtained from sequencing mrna from various tissues, our non-lethal sampling means that we can continue to monitor our study birds to explore additional genotype-phenotype relationships in the future. a possible limitation of sequencing only blood is the high level of hemoglobin transcripts often encountered   <cit> . however, we found that only 18% of read pairs  in the final data  mapped to hemoglobin , enabling us to still assemble comprehensive transcriptomes from a moderate number  of reads.table  <dig> summary of transcript assembly for lsk and rowi

greater than  <dig> thousand contigs in each of lsk and rowi have a full or partial open reading frame  greater than  <dig> amino acids and thus a predicted protein coding sequence. within species, approximately  <dig> of these contigs show strong homology to chicken protein sequences



after removal of the transcripts mapping to hemoglobin, two hundred million reads from each species were randomly selected for trinity assembly from those remaining, and formed  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs for lsk and rowi, respectively . of these,  <dig>  lsk and  <dig>  rowi transcripts had a predicted full or partial open reading frame  greater than  <dig> amino acids, which we focused our analyses on subsequently. using blastp, we found  <dig> transcripts in lsk and  <dig> transcripts in rowi with strong homology  to the chicken ensemble protein database .

blastn comparison determined that more than  <dig>  contigs containing orfs were shared between the two species with 99% average homology. thus, the lsk composite assembly was used as the master reference in all subsequent analyses . we found strong alignment between our composite lsk transcriptome and the recently published north island brown kiwi genome  <cit> . of our  <dig>  transcripts, 97%  mapped to at least one contig from the genome assembly with 76%  mapping to greater than 90% of the entire contig length with > 99% identity.

sequences were further annotated by searching the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using blastx . of the  <dig>  unique lsk contigs containing an annotated orf,  <dig>   had matches with an e-value of less than 1e− <dig>  most of these matches were to birds and reptiles , but a large diversity of species contributed to functional annotation. the highest number of top hits  were attributed to the mallard , chicken , peregrine falcon  and pigeon . secondly, we used blast2go to assign gene ontogeny  identifiers to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  sequences for which we obtained blastx results, or 53% of the  <dig>  contigs originally blasted. more than half of the annotated genes were associated with biological regulation or cellular, metabolic, or single-organism processes . greater than 80% of sequences annotated with a molecular function were associated with binding or catalytic activity , which is typical of transcriptomic studies regardless of taxa or tissue type sequenced . importantly, we identified numerous sequences associated with growth , reproduction  and development .fig.  <dig> percent of blast hits of kiwi mrna transcripts against ncbi non-redundant  database by vertebrate class. numbers above bars indicate number of species represented within the percentage. amphibians were represented solely by african clawed frogs  and fishes by the african coelacanth

sequence variation between and within species
one of the primary aims of this work was to define a highly confident sequence variant list that could be used for both population monitoring and genotype-phenotype associations in kiwi. to that end, we identified the full cohort of snp variation across all samples by comparison to the lsk reference assembly. we found  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps present in at least one lsk or rowi, respectively. to find markers with high confidence, we filtered for snps present in at least  <dig> reads per individual. this resulted in a total of  <dig>  snps in lsk and  <dig>  snps in rowi. of the snps found in rowi,  <dig>  in  <dig> contigs were exclusive to rowi and differentiate between the two species . a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   snps in lsk and rowi met our criteria for a marker that could distinguish individuals within each species:  placement within contigs where snp density was less than  <dig> per 200bp and  at least one individual with a snp frequency lower than 5% and one with a frequency greater than 35% .table  <dig> summary of snps discovered in lsk and rowi and those predicted to change protein coding sequences

snps that are unique to rowi and differentiate between species have greater than 50% coverage in each bird sequenced, a frequency of greater than 80% among all rowi sequenced, and less than 5% among sequenced lsk. snps that differentiate among lsk and rowi are within contigs with a snp density less than  <dig> per 200bp and have a frequency of greater than 35% in at least one individual and less than 5% in another



we further categorized snps based on their likely effect on the gene coding sequence, finding  <dig> in lsk and  <dig>  in rowi that result in changes to amino acid coding sequences . these potential markers map to genes present in each of the chicken chromosomes  and are candidates for targets of selection. in contrast, many of the snps we discovered are likely selectively neutral because they are positioned in untranslated regions of contigs or cause synonymous substitutions in coding regions.

polymorphism in rowi was more than double that observed among lsk. this pattern is not likely due to differences in sequencing depth as there is little correlation between the number of species specific snps and the total number of reads sequenced for any individual kiwi . more likely, the much greater snp diversity detected in rowi, a pattern that has also been observed in mtdna  <cit>  and among microsatellite loci  <cit> , reflects the differences in demographic history of the two species. lsk were reduced to five birds approximately  <dig> years ago and show numerous intense signs of this recent genetic bottleneck effect  <cit> . in contrast, rowi represent a very old and natural remnant population  <cit>  and though recently bottlenecked, retain greater ancestral genetic variation than lsk   <cit> .

differential gene expression between species and sexes
by mapping reads to the reference and counting the number of reads mapping to each transcript, we found significant differences in patterns of gene expression between kiwi species and sexes . a total of  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed by at least  <dig> fold between lsk and rowi , including  <dig> upregulated in lsk and  <dig> upregulated in rowi . mean upregulation of genes in lsk and rowi was  <dig>  fold  and  <dig>  fold , respectively. biological process go terms were assigned to  <dig> genes upregulated in lsk and  <dig> genes upregulated in rowi. the distribution of genes across go terms  was similar in the two species, with genes involved in cellular processes, localization, and signaling more prevalent among genes upregulated in lsk and genes involved in development and cellular component organization more prevalent among genes upregulated in rowi .fig.  <dig>

we did not use a  <dig> fold threshold in comparing expression differences between sexes as a  <dig> fold male-bias is expected of genes present on the z chromosome  but outside the pseudoautosomal region . we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a β-statistic >  <dig> between sexes . of these genes,  <dig> showed male-biased  and  <dig>  showed female biased expression . male-biased expression ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold with a mean of  <dig>  , while female-biased expression ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold with a mean of  <dig>  . of  <dig> genes differentially expressed between males and females,  <dig>  could be mapped to a chicken chromosome; approximately 95% of these  were syntenic to chrz and none were syntenic to w . the pattern of upregulation was particularly striking in males, with  <dig> genes syntenic to chicken chrz and only two syntenic to other chromosomes. we were able to assign biological process go terms to  <dig> genes showing male-biased expression and  <dig> genes exhibiting female-biased expression. the distribution of genes across go terms was similar between the sexes and to that observed between species.fig.  <dig> 
a heat map and cluster dendogram showing differential gene expression between male and female kiwi. green and red indicate low and high expression, respectively; data are normalized per gene and sample. mean male-biased  and female-biased  expression was  <dig> and  <dig> fold and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  sixty-four of  <dig> genes showing male-biased expression mapped to chicken chrz  distribution of male to female expression ratio  and snp density  across the mapping position of chicken chrz, including genes with significant male-biased expression  and genes equally expressed between sexes . lines represent a moving average across ten genes; yellow shading indicates chromosomal regions with both male-biased expression and snp density and so likely outside the par



expression differences observed between species may reflect differences in the age of birds or their environment. all of our samples came from birds greater than one year of age and well past the timeframe of gonadal differentiation marking the onset of sex specific expression in other ratites   <cit> . however, our lsk samples were largely from adult birds inhabiting three locations, our rowi samples were exclusively from juveniles  inhabiting a fourth location, and gene expression can differ markedly with age and between environments, even after gonad differentiation  <cit> . thus, the transcriptional variance observed between lsk and rowi could reflect physiological differences between adults and juveniles, environmental differences between the islands they occupy, or evolutionary divergence between the brown , north island brown kiwi, and rowi) and spotted  and lsk) clades of kiwi  <cit> . in contrast, age and environmental effects cannot explain the observed sex-biased expression in lsk and rowi, because the sex ratio was equal within each age  and location  sampled. thus, differences in gene expression between the sexes likely reflect evolutionary differences between male and female kiwi.

chickens and ratites exhibit strong chromosomal homology  despite having diverged from a common ancestor  <dig> or more million years ago  <cit> . indeed, highly conserved synteny among avian taxa allows chromosomal locations of kiwi genes to be predicted from that of chicken  <cit> . in contrast, there is a huge diversity among birds in the degree of homomorphy and recombination between their z and w chromosomes. the portions of the chromosomes that recombine define the par, where the same genes are present on both sex chromosomes and their sequences nearly identical  <cit> . many avian lineages, including chicken, have highly differentiated sex chromosomes and a very small par, while more than two-thirds of the emu  and ostrich  z chromosomes recombine with the w defining a very large par  <cit> . this pattern is not common to all ratites however, as the size of the par varies among tinamou species  and can represent as little as 1% of chrz   <cit> . the extent of homomorphy in kiwi sex chromosomes is unknown, and there is considerable scope for kiwi to differ from other ratites in sex chromosome arrangement since they diverged from their nearest extant ratite relatives, the emu and cassowary , approximately 58mya  <cit> .

given that dosage compensation is essentially lacking in birds and females are the heterogametic sex  <cit> , genes on chrz are expected to be expressed in males at equal  to twice  the level observed in females. similarly, snp density is expected to be equal between the sexes at chrz genes within the par, but male-biased in genes outside the par for which females are always hemizygous  <cit> . in line with these expectations, we found clear bimodal expression of genes mapped to chicken chrz , with a minority displaying two-fold male-biased expression  and the majority displaying equal expression in males and females . regions of chrz with male-biased expression also displayed male biased snp density, which is consistent with these regions being outside of the par .

upregulated kiwi genes formed disjunct clusters across the chicken chromosome. this clustering has been observed previously in ostriches and attributed to extensive pars exhibiting strong recombination and homomorphy  <cit>  in conjunction with chromosomal inversions since the evolutionary split of paleognaths and neognaths  <cit> . our data are consistent with these observations, and suggest that kiwi exhibit an ancestral state of sex chromosome differentiation similar to that of the ostrich and emu, with large pars and little differentiation between the z and w chromosomes  <cit> . the much greater mean expression among female-biased genes may be due to sexual antagonism  <cit> . mutations on ratite sex chromosomes are more likely to fall within than outside the par. if these mutations are also sexually antagonistic, they cannot be restricted to the sex they benefit via restricted recombination between the sex chromosomes. strongly sex-biased expression, however, can moderate the influence of these genes via upregulation in the sex they benefit, downregulation in the sex they harm, or both  <cit> .

candidate genes
our data contain numerous functional genes that are potentially under selection in kiwi. for example, we have identified a kiwi gene that is homologous with chicken igf1r  and associated with growth and body size in birds  <cit> , as well as seven forkhead box  genes encoding transcription factors critical to proper development and healthy ageing . the latter includes foxc <dig> which is associated with ocular development and early onset glaucoma  and could be related to the unusually high frequency of cataracts in rowi .

numerous kiwi genes likely associated with disease resistance were also discovered, including ovotransferrin   <cit> , nine toll-like receptor genes   <cit> , and  <dig> tumor necrosis factor genes   <cit> . tf encodes an iron-binding glycoprotein found in avian egg whites, serum, and eggshells that is associated with resistance to a wide variety of infections  <cit> . similarly, tlr genes function in pathogen recognition and innate immune responses  <cit> ; they are targets of episodic and balancing selection in birds and highly polymorphic  <cit> . tnf genes have roles in controlling inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation and have been associated with numerous and varied diseases in vertebrates  <cit> . variation within these genes could be a key component of fitness differences observed among kiwi. the first instances of avian malaria and small pox in kiwi were recently reported and kiwi management provides conditions that could promote the spread of infection via captive rearing of chicks and translocations of adults  <cit> . tf and tlrs exhibit antimicrobial properties that could be critical for kiwi survival as well. kiwi eggs have extremely high levels of antimicrobial proteins relative to other birds, including other ratites . they also exhibit high levels of microbial contamination  with bacteria known to cause embryonic death in kiwi and other birds  <cit> . thus, microbial infection of eggs and embryos could be a major cause of the hatching failure observed in wild kiwi  <cit>  and potentially have a genetic basis among individual kiwi as well.

finally, our data also contain genes associated with important avian reproductive and behavioral traits. for example, gnrh <dig>  is associated with double yolking  <cit> , npy2r  affects age at first lay and induces precocious puberty in chickens  <cit> , igfii  regulates avian ovarian function and egg productivity  <cit> , and opn <dig>  encodes a uv sensitive photoreceptor protein that regulates seasonal reproduction in birds  <cit> . variation in these candidate genes may explain the extreme variation observed in reproductive success among the critically endangered rowi or among kiwi species generally. similarly, exploring patterns of variation at several kiwi genes associated with important avian behaviors may shed light on kiwi ecology and conservation. these include drd <dig> , which is associated with novelty seeking and exploratory behavior in birds and potentially related to colonization success  <cit> , and foxp <dig> , which is hypothesized to be involved in avian song learning and production  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
whole genome studies have been increasingly applied to species conservation since the advent of next generation sequencing  <cit> . for example, whole genome data have been used to determine that red  and great lakes  wolves arose from recent hybridization with other canids due to habitat changes and predator control efforts. this finding will likely shift the focus of conservation management from maintaining the admixed populations to conserving older, evolutionarily independent species  <cit> . whole genome studies also recently found significant genetic population structuring and extensive inbreeding within species of great apes  as well as pervasive hybridization among individuals in captivity  <cit> . these finding will provide the basis for genetic management of wild and captive great apes. studies at the genomic level have also proven powerful for detecting selection and adaptation in endangered species. for example, rapid and positive selection has been shown for traits related to a predatory lifestyle in desert habitats in falcons   <cit>  and to diet shifts and olfaction in endangered giant pandas   <cit> . finally, genomics has contributed to conservation via improving the resolution of historical demography studies. for example, sumatran orangutans  currently have higher genetic diversity than bornean orangutans  despite a seven-fold lower population size. this pattern is apparently due to an exponential expansion of sumatran orangutans and a decline in bornean orangutans after their split ~ <dig> thousand years ago  <cit> .

our study will allow a similar leap forward in conservation genomics of kiwi by providing a genome-wide resource to investigate their evolution and ecology and inform management. the transcriptome provides a critical complement to understanding an organism’s genome. thus, we expect the transcriptome assemblies provided here to be valuable in delineating the structure of rowi and lsk genomes once available. our data contain autosomal and sex linked genetic markers representing both putatively neutral loci and loci under selection. this will vastly improve the current power of population genetics studies of kiwi which to date have been based on  <dig> microsatellite loci at most   <cit> . our new suite of markers will be used to test parentage, build pedigrees, and resolve relationships among birds relative to their mating and territorial behavior, as well as to improve estimates of inbreeding and the frequency of hybridization among kiwi. they will also improve the power of assignment tests for birds and eggs of unknown provenance, such as unlabeled museum specimens and those confiscated from illegal trade. the sex linked markers we have discovered  may prove helpful to sex kiwi eggs, chicks, juveniles and remains which cannot be sexed phenotypically. coupled with nuclear and mtdna markers, they will also advance our understanding of sex specific dispersal patterns among kiwi, pseudoautosomal inheritance, and lack of dosage compensation in birds  <cit> . finally, the numerous functional genes we have identified will allow powerful tests for genotype-phenotype associations in kiwi growth, development, disease resistance, reproduction, and behavior. functional sequence variation in all of these candidate genes can now be assayed in hundreds of individual kiwi, bringing cutting-edge genomic techniques to bear on conservation of this ancient avian lineage.
