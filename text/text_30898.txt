BACKGROUND
comparative genomics allows the transfer of genomic information from a well-characterized species to another that is less well described. it can be applied at all levels from that of the chromosome to the genome sequence. however, despite the recent advances in sequencing technologies, the considerable effort involved in producing a genome sequence assembly is reflected by the small number of vertebrate genomes that have been sequenced to date. in birds, there is only one published genome sequence, that of the chicken  <cit> , with the zebra finch genome due to be published soon.

combining cross-species fluorescent in-situ hybridization  and microarray analysis using resources developed in the chicken provides a powerful tool for the identification of gross genomic rearrangements, gene gains/losses, copy number variants  and gene order in other bird species. these techniques do not require sequence data for any species other than the reference . we have previously successfully used this approach for a genome wide comparison of chromosomal rearrangements and cnvs between chicken and turkey <cit> . this revealed a strong conservation of genome structure over about  <dig> million years of evolution between chicken and turkey <cit> . in particular, our results suggested that, when compared to mammalian genomes, bird genomes contain a low number of cnvs . the latter finding indicates that patterns of cnvs in bird genomes mirror the low number of chromosomal rearrangements in this phylogenetic group <cit> .

following on from the turkey, the pekin duck  is the next obvious target among domestic birds for detailed genomic studies due to its agricultural importance, with worldwide duck consumption being between  <dig> and 5% of the total poultry market <cit> . duck is also an important target for immunological studies because of its resistance to avian influenza <cit> . despite this, genomic information about the duck is limited to a few linkage and physical mapping studies. huang et al.  <cit>  produced a preliminary genetic map based on  <dig> microsatellite loci and assigned  <dig> out of  <dig> linkage groups to ten duck  chromosomes by fish mapping of  <dig> bacs. cross-species chromosome painting and g-banding studies  <cit>  have suggested one interchromosomal difference between the chicken and duck karyotypes – the ancestral chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  fused in the chicken lineage to give gga4q and gga4p respectively, remain separate in duck <cit> . this interchromosomal rearrangement presumably explains the difference in diploid chromosome number between the two species, which is 2n =  <dig> in chicken and 2n =  <dig> in duck. fish mapping of  <dig> chicken bacs revealed small intrachromosomal rearrangements in apl <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and z and confirmed synteny for gga <dig>   <dig>  13– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the duck genome <cit> . however, no molecular markers are available for the remaining microchromosomes, which are indistinguishable by conventional cytogenetics. it is also unclear which duck chromosome corresponds to gga4p . thus, from a molecular cytogenetic standpoint, the duck genome is at present only partially defined, and given the low number of physical markers mapped by fish, it is possible that hitherto undetected intrachromosomal rearrangements exist.

no data are currently available concerning cnvs in duck or indeed any other bird species than chicken and turkey. cnvs have been found to contribute significantly to normal and disease-related genetic and phenotypic variation in humans and other primates <cit> . studies of the evolutionary significance of cnvs have largely focused on primates and revealed numerous lineage-specific gene gains and losses and cnvs .

our previous study of cnvs in chicken and turkey revealed a total of  <dig> cnvs <cit> . five of these cnvs appear to be shared in layer and broiler chickens, and in turkey, at regions dubbed "cnv hotspots" . given that the contribution of cnvs to phenotypic variation is becoming increasingly clear, analyses of this kind of structural variation in organismic groups other than mammals are clearly needed.

here, we present a detailed molecular cytogenetic map for the duck based on comparative fish mapping of  <dig> chicken bacs, which revealed several hitherto undescribed intrachromosomal rearrangements. we also provide an analysis of cnvs in the duck genome by array comparative genomic hybridisation  of duck dna to a commercially available chicken whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling path microarray. the analysis of cnvs supports the hypotheses that bird genomes contain fewer cnvs than mammalian genomes and that some cnvs appear to be consistently shared across species, forming cnv hotspots.

RESULTS
comparative fish mapping between chicken and duck
of  <dig> bacs that successfully hybridized to chicken metaphases,  <dig>  could be visualized with confidence on duck chromosomes. these covered the majority of the karyotype i.e. apl1– <dig> and z . figure  <dig> shows the g-banded ideograms for gga1– <dig> and z and apl1– <dig> and z <cit> , with the positions of the bacs mapped to these chromosomes; the full data are presented in additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows example fish results. only one interchromosomal difference was detected among the macrochromosomes, the retention of the ancestral chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in duck .

fish mapping suggested intrachromosomal rearrangements on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  z and apl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and z. bacs wag24h <dig>  wag30b <dig> and wag36c <dig> clearly showed a rearrangement on gga1p and apl1p. the order of bacs was not completely inverted, suggesting that the underlying rearrangement may be a translocation rather than a paracentric inversion. bacs wag7c <dig> and wag13k <dig>  mapped to gga1p and apl1q, indicating a small pericentric inversion. besides, some bacs mapping to gga1q and apl1q suggested possible rearrangements on these chromosome arms; however, the high standard deviations in the flpter measurements determined for these bacs in duck made it difficult to distinguish artefacts from real changes in marker order.

bacs wag42g <dig> and wag9l <dig> mapped to gga2q and apl2p, providing clear evidence of a pericentric inversion. however, bac wag18g <dig>  which mapped close to the centromere on gga2p, also hybridized close to the centromere in apl2p. this demonstrated that the inversion involves only a small fraction of 2p.

bacs wag13i <dig>  wag23k <dig>  wag21j <dig> and wag22j <dig> clearly demonstrated a paracentric inversion on gga4q and apl <dig> .

the morphological differences between gga <dig> and apl <dig> were reflected in a change in marker order involving bacs wag69p <dig>  wag59h <dig> and wag21p <dig>  however, like in the rearrangement on gga1p and apl1p, marker order was not completely inverted, indicating that this rearrangement may be more complex than a simple pericentric inversion. similarly, our fish mapping results did not provide clear evidence for a pericentric inversion causing the morphological differences between gga <dig> and apl <dig> 

marker order on ggaz and aplz chromosome was largely conserved, with the possible exception of a small inversion involving bacs wag22p <dig> and wag20l <dig>  thus, it seems that the morphological differences between the metacentric ggaz and the subtelocentric aplz are due to neocentromere formation rather than a pericentric inversion.

dual-color fish experiments with bacs mapping to either end of a microchromosome were used to check for conserved synteny among the microchromosomes. this demonstrated conserved synteny for apl <dig>   <dig>  14– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  27– <dig>  the bacs successfully hybridized to the microchromosomes are listed in additional file 2; example results are shown in figure 2e, f.

fish mapping of bacs wag112c <dig> and wag23i <dig> facilitated the identification of the duck orthologue of gga4p. chromosome area measurements suggested that this chromosome should be numbered as apl <dig>  there were no major differences in size order between the remaining microchromosomes and their chicken orthologues.

copy number variation between chicken and duck
hybridisation of genomic dna from two female ducks to the nimblegen chicken whole genome tiling path microarray revealed  <dig> cnvs, of which ten were seen in both individuals . both gains and losses relative to chicken were seen . the mean and median lengths of the detected cnvs were  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb respectively, ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb. the cnv locations were compared with those previously found in turkey and chicken broilers and layers <cit> . six cnvs overlapped with cnvs identified in turkey, and of these five cnvs matched the five potential cnv 'hotspots' described by griffin et al.  <cit>  . three of the 'hotspot' cnvs were seen in both ducks. known or predicted genes were found to be associated with  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvs . in the ten cases where no genes were associated, all were losses, and all except one were found either near to the beginning or end of the chromosome . the exception, cnv# <dig>  covered a sequence gap, which likely contains centromeric repeats. two of the cnvs, # <dig> and # <dig>  were in regions that are potentially involved in rearrangements on gga <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

discussion
comparative cytogenetic map of the duck genome
previous studies of avian genome evolution using cross-species fish have suggested that gross genome structure is remarkably conserved among birds. duck is no exception from this pattern; in fact it appears that the duck karyotype corresponds very closely to the putative ancestral avian karyotype  <cit> . the conservation of ancestral chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  as apl <dig> and apl <dig> are consistent with both the previous studies on duck and with broader patterns of avian genome evolution <cit> . these chromosomes appear intact in almost all birds, and ancestral chromosome  <dig> is seen intact in human chromosome  <dig> as well <cit> . our finding that only 39% of the bacs provided identifiable signals is attributable to the evolutionary distance between chicken and duck ; we achieved a 70% success rate mapping chicken bacs in turkey  <cit>  , and our experience suggests that success rates of cross-species fish with bacs rapidly decrease with increased evolutionary distance. this is also reflected by increased levels of non-specific background hybridisation from repetitive content, especially on the macrochromosomes, accounting for our wider error bars when assigning positions to bacs on these chromosomes.

in agreement with previous studies, no other interchromosomal rearrangements were detected between chicken and duck. however, our bac mapping data are consistent with intrachromosomal rearrangements distinguishing chromosomes gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  z and apl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and z, which confirms and expands on previous findings <cit> . the detection of additional rearrangements on gga <dig> and apl <dig> and gga4q and apl <dig> was due to the much higher number of bacs hybridized in this study compared to previous studies. likewise, higher density mapping demonstrated that the morphological differences between ggaz and aplz are probably due to the formation of a neocentromere rather than a pericentric inversion. this type of chromosomal rearrangement was previously reported in birds only for the red-legged partridge  <cit>  and the japanese quail <cit> . however, despite the good coverage of the duck cytogenetic map presented here, it was not possible to determine unequivocally the nature of all chromosomal rearrangements observed between chicken and duck. it seems likely however that, in addition to peri- and paracentric inversions and neocentromere formation, translocations contributed to avian genome evolution. this conclusion is based on the order of bacs associated with rearrangements on gga <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and apl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which is not entirely consistent with the order expected if the rearrangements were inversions. thus, it appears that while the available data from comparative fish mapping suggest a relatively low frequency of intrachromosomal rearrangements in the evolution of bird genomes, the underlying processes may be more diverse than previously appreciated. undoubtedly, the higher resolution afforded by genome sequencing projects such as that of the zebra finch will help to resolve this question.

the evolutionary direction of intrachromosomal changes could be determined for gga <dig> and apl <dig> only. comparison with the turkey map  <cit>  suggested that apl <dig> likely represents the ancestral state; the order of bacs on turkey chromosome  <dig>  and the morphology of this chromosome is the same as in duck, indicating that the rearrangement has occurred in the chicken lineage. due to a lack of comparative data, it was not possible to determine the polarity of the remaining intrachromosomal rearrangements. if bac positions are compared between this map and the turkey map , the differences fit the patterns expected from the previously described inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements.

among the rearrangements that we detected, the inversion observed in gga4q and apl <dig> is of particular interest. morphological differences in gga <dig> have been described between different chicken breeds <cit> , and the ancestral bird chromosome  <dig>  is also one of the chromosomes most prone to convergent independent fusions in birds   <cit> . this contrasts with the conserved synteny of the ancestral bird chromosome  <dig>  in humans. together, the data suggest that rearrangements in chromosome  <dig> may be more common than has been suspected from previous comparative genomic studies, and analyzing them will prove valuable for understanding avian and other vertebrate genome evolution.

the present study extended the data previously available for conserved synteny among the microchromosomes. fillon et al.  <cit> demonstrated conserved synteny for seven microchromosome pairs ; here we demonstrate conserved synteny for ten microchromosome pairs . the lack of detected rearrangements makes it reasonable to suggest that there are very few, if any, rearrangements among the remaining microchromosomes – including the as-yet unexamined smallest microchromosomes for which no markers exist. indeed, no sequence data from the chicken genome has yet been assigned to these smallest chromosomes, and it is still unclear why, although there is a suggestion that there may be a cloning or sequencing bias against microchromosomal sequences <cit> . data on conserved microchromosomal synteny in other bird species are restricted to the japanese quail  and the turkey <cit> . despite the paucity of data, the emerging picture is one of remarkable conservation among most avian species, with the exception of a few groups where large-scale interchromosomal rearrangements are common .

the detailed cytogenetic map allowed for an improved definition of the duck karyotype. chromosome banding and macrochromosome painting studies had previously shown orthology of apl1– <dig> and z to gga1– <dig>  4q, 5– <dig> and z  <cit> . however, it was not known which duck chromosome corresponded to chicken chromosome 4p; fillon et al.  <cit> suggested that this was approximately apl10– <dig>  in this study we have used a combination of bac mapping and chromosome area measurements which suggest that this chromosome should be numbered as apl <dig>  moreover we found no evidence for rearrangements among the microchromosomes. accordingly, we propose that duck chromosomes be numbered as per chicken for 1–9; that apl <dig> corresponds to gga4p; then gga <dig> onwards correspond to apl <dig> onwards. the successful hybridization of at least one bac from gga1– <dig>  means markers are now available for apl1– <dig>  and z. taken together, these results enabled us to define unequivocally chromosomes apl1– <dig> 

copy number variation between chicken and duck
the purpose of our array cgh experiments was to test two of our earlier hypotheses:  that birds show a reduced number of cnvs compared to mammals,  that genomic cnv hotspots described previously in chicken and turkey  <cit>  are found in the duck as well . the successful hybridizations that we observed, despite approximately  <dig> million years of divergence between chicken and duck <cit> , extend avian cross-species microarray experiments from the sole previous study in turkey <cit> . the present study revealed a total of  <dig> cnvs in the duck when compared to the chicken, which is substantially fewer than the  <dig> cnvs discovered in a comparison of human and chimpanzee <cit> , which diverged only 6– <dig> million years ago <cit> . while this result supports the hypothesis that bird genomes show fewer cnvs than mammalian ones, it should also be noted that we found twice as many cnvs in duck as were found in the comparison of turkey and chicken   <cit> . only ten of these cnvs were found in both duck specimens examined, indicating substantial intraspecific variation. these findings highlight the need for further studies with larger sample sizes and call for some caution when comparing the frequency of cnvs in birds and mammals.

the comparison of cnvs between chicken breeds and turkey revealed five tentative cnv hotspots by virtue of the fact that they contained cnvs of similar size in different chicken lines and in turkey <cit> . of these five hotspot regions, three contained cnvs in both ducks and two contained cnvs in one duck. the hotspot regions contain a number of novel genes including most of the available sequence for gga <dig>  covering the mhc loci. moreover these findings lend support to our avian "cnv hotspot hypothesis" but, of course, need to be confirmed by analysing a wider number of species.

all copy number gains  were located in coding regions. genes in regions of copy number gain relative to chicken included transcription factors, neural proliferation control and neurotransmitter activity, and a predicted mhc class i gene. this is consistent with previously described duplication of the mhc class i locus in the mallard duck, followed by subsequent inactivation of some of the extra gene copies <cit> .

where copy number losses relative to chicken were detected, two possible explanations exist: a true copy number loss, or sequence divergence leading to lack of hybridization on the microarray. if such sequence divergence had occurred, however, the loss might be expected in both individuals. this was only seen for  <dig> cnvs; the remainder are more likely to be true polymorphic copy number differences. however, it is important to note that about two thirds of all apparent copy number losses were observed in coding regions; hence, the observed loss in hybridization efficiency is likely associated with functional consequences, regardless of whether it is due to copy number change or sequence divergence. thus these results highlight genomic regions that are of particular interest for further functional and evolutionary studies.

it has been suggested that segmental duplications are correlated with cnvs, and facilitate chromosomal rearrangements, the lack of segmental duplications in birds therefore explaining the relative paucity of cnvs <cit> . due to the vastly different levels of resolution afforded by cytogenetic mapping and microarray analysis, it is difficult to directly correlate the results of these two methods. nevertheless, it is interesting to note that two of the cnvs revealed in this paper appear to coincide with rearrangements detected from the cytogenetic mapping. these are cnvs # <dig> and # <dig>  on chromosomes gga <dig> and  <dig> respectively. further studies are necessary to examine this link between chromosomal rearrangements and cnvs in more detail.

CONCLUSIONS
the comparative cytogenetic map of the duck presented here highlights the extraordinary conservation seen among the genomes of many bird species, and how little structural genetic variation is readily apparent. the cytogenetic map will allow the transfer of genetic information directly from chicken to duck, expediting mapping studies in the duck and help to target marker development in duck through the prediction of new loci. the combination of area measurements and fish mapping of chicken bacs allowed the identification of markers for chromosomes apl1– <dig> and 26– <dig> which will facilitate further mapping studies in the duck. moreover, we have extended the analysis of cnvs in birds, providing further evidence that birds have low numbers of cnvs when compared to mammals and that bird genomes contain cnv hotspots. while overall we confirm the evolutionary conservation of bird genomes, the intrachromosomal differences and cnvs found highlight areas of future interest for evolutionary and functional studies.
