BACKGROUND
snakes employ a great variety of biochemical compounds to immobilize, kill, and digest their prey  <cit> , although whether venom actually augments assimilation efficiency is a matter of continuing debate  <cit> . biochemical mechanisms employed in prey envenomation involve a complex interplay between venom chemistry and homeostatic mechanisms in the prey; thus, envenomation success depends upon exploiting the prey’s biochemistry  <cit> . venom composition necessarily reflects both the biology of the snake and the nature of its principal prey, factors that change ontogenetically and geographically  <cit> .

biochemical components of a venom participate in one or more of three fundamental envenomation strategies. two of these are prey immobilization strategies and may be denominated “hypotensive” and “paralytic” strategies  <cit> . both serve to limit prey flight, in snake taxa which strike, release, and then track their prey , or to overcome prey resistance, in snakes that seize and bulldog their prey . the third strategy is digestive and commences degradation of prey tissues internally, even before the prey has been engulfed. normally, all three strategies operate simultaneously and many individual venom components participate in more than one of them. each of these three strategies contains interchangeable biochemical constituents. different venomous taxa employ different combinations of constituents, and no single species employs them all  <cit> .

snake venom composition can be studied either at the proteomic or the transcriptomic level. traditionally, snake proteins were sequenced after chromatographic purification, after isolation on polyacrylamide gels, or after cloning cdna from the venom glands. although these approaches are typically necessary for studies of protein function, they are laborious, and they are less quantitative than might be desired. because a relatively small number of individual proteins or clones can be processed at one time, and because techniques vary between labs, comparative analyses of venom chemistry have been difficult  <cit> . wagstaff et al.  <cit>  found 80% of echis ocellatus venom proteins identified with mass spectrometry in the corresponding transcriptome, but 67% of transcripts were not found in the proteome. in a study of bothropoides pauloensis venom, rodrigues et al.  <cit>  reported “a low degree of correspondence” between transcriptome and proteome. the degree of correspondence varied, depending upon the protein family. transcriptome and proteome were in good agreement in regard to bradykinin-potentiating peptides, phospholipases a <dig>  and l-amino acid oxidase, but diverged sharply with regard to metalloproteases and c-type lectin-like components. to date, no study has attempted to perform a rigorous statistical comparison of transcriptome and proteome.

recent technological advances in mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing have greatly simplified both proteomic and transcriptomic studies of snake venoms. snake venom transcriptomes are now routinely sequenced on a variety of platforms, allowing examination of many more components than has been possible traditionally. in particular, illumina sequencing, has allowed more accurate quantification of mrna composition. however, in addition to venom proteins, next generation cdna sequencing also detects many non-venom components, and erroneous assemblies are another possible source of error. the advent of lc/ms-based venom proteomics permits high throughput screening of venom components  <cit> . this approach relies on existing databases of protein sequences, and can be limited by the availability of reference data. lc/ms is not typically used to estimate protein abundance. used together, next generation cdna sequencing and lc/ms have considerable power, since mass spectrometry can validate cdna sequencing. however, relatively few venom studies have combined the two tools  <cit> . here both techniques were used to explore the venoms of two okinawan pit vipers, with the goal of understanding their venom chemistry, and evaluating the performance of lc/ms as a tool for quantifying venom protein composition.

okinawa, japan has two native pit vipers, the okinawa habu  and the himehabu . human activities have introduced the taiwanese habu  and the sakishima habu  as well. the two native species differ in nearly all aspects of their biology. the okinawa habu is semi-arboreal and can reach lengths of  <dig>  m. it is active in the warmer months of the year. in contrast, the himehabu is terrestrial, usually not exceeding 70 cm  <cit>  and is active at temperatures as low as 10°c  <cit> .

most vipers and pit vipers display a well-documented ontogenetic shift from ectothermic prey  to endotherms  <cit> . protobothrops flavoviridis follows the usual pattern. nishimura et al.  <cit>  have documented pronounced ontogenetic dietary shifts in protobothrops. okinawa habus less than 30 cm in length feed heavily on lizards . amphibians comprise only 3% of the juvenile diet, while house mice  and horsfield’s shrews  constitute another  <dig> %. subadult and adult okinawa habus  feed less on amphibians  and lizards , while birds become an important component , and mammals  become more important . habus above  <dig>  m become exclusive mammal feeders  <cit> .

ovophis okinavensis, by virtue of its small adult size, does not exhibit an apparent dietary shift  <cit> . while it is technically a dietary generalist  <cit> , its seasonal activity is strongly correlated with frog abundance. in many ovophis populations, frogs comprise nearly 90% of the food items taken by both juveniles and adults  <cit> .

the present study employed illumina cdna sequencing and lc/ms to investigate the transcriptomes and proteomes of these two native pit vipers. this was done to further illuminate the composition of these two venoms and to ascertain whether the two techniques were congruent.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing, assembly and mapping
after quality filtering,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads remained, as well as  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> single-end reads, in the ovophis and protobothrops libraries, respectively, which were used for the assembly. when re-mapped to the assembly using rsem, which used only paired-end read data,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads were mapped, with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these reads being properly paired in alignment. after filtering low-frequency transcripts , assemblies were reduced from  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts for ovophis and protobothrops, respectively, to  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts.

transcriptomes
the protobothrops transcriptome contained partial and complete transcripts for  <dig> identifiable toxins, representing  <dig> protein families . expression levels spanned nearly six orders of magnitude. in addition, we identified another  <dig> sequences in nine more families that are either known to contribute to venom function ), or which potentially do so. the latter group includes tissue enzymes that have been recruited into some venomes  and purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes  that are extremely important in viperid and elapid venoms, but less so in those of crotalids  <cit> . while  <dig> families were represented by a single sequence , others displayed anywhere from 2- <dig> sequences. metalloproteases  , serine proteases  , and c-type lectins   were the most diversified families in protobothrops venom ; however, the most diversified families are not necessarily the most heavily expressed. forty of the  <dig> sequences were identical or nearly so, to sequences previously published for this species. another  <dig> were most similar to toxins known from other venomous snake taxa. the remaining  <dig> were most similar to sequences from other vertebrate taxa, including amphibians, lizards, and mammals; thus, in total there were an estimated  <dig> new sequences for this species, including the  <dig> that were novel for snakes.

the ovophis transcriptome contained  <dig> transcripts for identifiable toxins belonging to  <dig> toxin families . purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes, acetylcholinesterase, and glutaminyl cyclase comprised another  <dig> transcripts. the range of expression levels was similar to that seen in the protobothrops transcriptome. in the ovophis transcriptome, sps were the most diversified family , followed by mps , and ctls . only one sequence, a phospholipase a <dig>  has been previously published for this species. another  <dig> sequences were most similar to those of other snakes, while  <dig> were most similar to sequences from the iguanid lizard, anolis carolinensis. in total,  <dig> partial and complete sequences reported herein appear to be new for ovophis okinavensis.

the two transcriptomes revealed fundamentally different envenomation strategies . in protobothrops venom glands, phospholipases a <dig>   and metalloproteases  were the dominant constituents, followed by factor ix/x activators , sp transcripts , and l-amino acid oxidase   . thus, these five protein classes accounted for  <dig> % of all transcripts. in ovophis venom glands, sps were the dominant component , followed by mps , pla <dig> , lao , and c-type lectin-like proteins  , . thus, in ovophis, the dominant five classes comprise  <dig> % of total venom transcripts.

significant differences are also evident in terms of minor components . three-finger toxins , paraoxonase, vespryn, and waprin transcripts were found in the protobothrops transcriptome, but were absent in ovophis. five acetylcholinesterase  transcripts and crotasin-like transcripts were found in the ovophis transcriptome, but not in that of protobothrops. glutaminyl cyclase  cdna was detected at lower levels in the ovophis transcriptome. 5’-nucleotidase, crisp, ctl, nerve growth factor , and phosphodiesterase  transcripts were significantly more abundant in protobothrops venom, whereas dipeptidyl peptidase iv  was more abundant in ovophis venom glands .

both transcriptomes also contained numerous transcripts that appear unrelated to envenomation . the majority of these appear to be cellular proteins and were transcribed at very low levels. peptides were also isolated for many of these . whether such constituents make a significant contribution to envenomation is unknown, but it seems unlikely.

proteomes
peptides were isolated from 100% of venom or venom-related transcripts that were more abundant than contaminants  . peptides were also isolated from at least  <dig> transcripts in the two transcriptomes that occurred below contaminant levels .

comparison between proteomic and transcriptomic data sets
although one would expect to find strong correlations between venom gland mrna and protein profiles, such a link has been elusive  <cit> . lack of correlation between the two types of data may be due to biological reasons, such as biased processing of messenger transcripts. alternatively, purely technical reasons may have prevented accurate estimation of cdna or protein abundance, particularly in early studies in which sequencing by the sanger method limited the number of clones. although our measure of protein abundance was relatively crude, we were nonetheless able to detect a correlation  between mrna and venom protein levels .

we were able to confirm the correlation between proteomic and transcriptomic estimates of protein abundance using publicly available data from ncbi . there were no proteins detected in the ncbi data set that were missing from our transcriptome, suggesting that we were able to capture all of the transcriptional diversity. the robustness of the result also argues against a spurious correlation driven by poor assembly and mapping of low fpkm transcripts.

the correlation, although significant, explained only about half of the variance in the data. apparent differences between mrna and protein levels may stem from several factors, both biological and analytical. for example, although tissue and venom samples were taken from the same individuals, they were taken at different times. if venom components are synthesized at different rates the two measurements might not agree. likewise, it is possible that due to extensive post-translational modification of many venom components, not all messenger transcripts have an equal chance of becoming mature proteins. it is also likely that our measure of protein abundance is not sufficiently precise, due perhaps to biased cleavage of proteins or biases in ion detection during lc/ms. proteins differ in their susceptibility to enzymatic digestion. even though three proteases  were used, few proteins were digested equally well by all three. more abundant peptides are much more likely to be detected by mass spectrometry than others. lastly, it is probable that incomplete transcripts stemming from the short read length diminished the strength of the correlations. newer illumina sequencer models  now boast read lengths as great as 500 bp, which may mitigate this problem in future studies.

there are a large number of toxin and potential toxin transcripts that are expressed at near-zero levels . these include 3-finger toxins, ache, acid phosphomonoesterase, crotasin-like proteins, paraoxonase, tissue factor pathway inhibitor , vespryns, waprins, and many mp and sp transcripts. there is no evidence that many of these are actually translated, or, if they are, they are not a substantial proportion of the proteome. this raises the question of what function these transcripts may now have, or may have had previously. are these merely tissue transcripts that have not actually been incorporated into the venome? how high an expression level would be required before novel venom proteins would have selective value, or would be under selective pressure? undoubtedly selective pressure would vary with the biochemical envenomation strategy employed by the taxon in question, and also upon the nature of the contribution made by a given toxin to that strategy. given the massive overkill that most venoms generate, it is likely that a substantial contribution would be required to generate much selective pressure. it also seems likely that there would be more selective pressure to increase prey immobilization efficiency than acute toxicity or assimilation efficiency.

major venom constituents

metalloproteases

snake venom mps are presently classified into four groups, according to domain structure and size: p-i mps possess a metalloprotease domain only and are largely hemorrhagic; p-ii mps are larger, with metalloprotease and disintegrin domains; p-iii enzymes have metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains; and p-iv enzymes have a lectin-like domain linked by disulfide bonds to a p-iii structure  <cit> . the structural complexity of p-iii enzymes has resulted in greater functional diversity. they promote hemorrhage, inflammation, apoptosis, and prothrombin activation, while inhibiting platelet aggregation. as a general rule, p-iii enzymes are more potent hemorrhagins than p-i enzymes  <cit> . in addition to degrading vascular endothelial basement membrane , collectively, mps exhibit diverse and variable combinations of activities. some anticoagulant metalloproteases degrade only the fibrinogen aα chain  <cit> , while others degrade one or more chains of both fibrinogen and fibrin with varying specificity  <cit> . still others release histamine  <cit> , antagonize platelet aggregation by different mechanisms  <cit> , or activate  <cit>  or digest plasminogen  <cit> . some are procoagulant, possessing factor xa-like activity  <cit> . few laboratories have exhaustively assayed mps for potential biological and biochemical activities; thus, inferring such functions from structure is almost impossible. the same may be said of sps.

the protobothrops transcriptome contained transcripts for twelve p-ii mps and nine p-iii mps. one of the p-ii enzymes  constituted  <dig> % of all toxin transcripts and collectively p-ii transcripts accounted for barely ~ <dig> % of the transcriptome . p-iii transcripts were more abundant, comprising  <dig> % of all transcripts. three sequences were homologous to hemorrhagic proteases hr1a and b  <cit> . the ovophis transcriptome included seven p-ii transcripts and three p-iii transcripts. in ovophis, p-ii transcripts represented only  <dig> % of all transcripts . p-iii transcripts added another  <dig> %. thus mps comprised a mere  <dig> % of the ovophis transcriptome, compared to  <dig> % in protobothrops .

of the  <dig> protobothrops mps, peptides were sequenced by mass spectrometry for  <dig>  with coverage ranging from  <dig> - <dig> % of the respective transcripts . peptide coverage of ovophis mps ranged from  <dig> - <dig> % .


phospholipases a


2


the protobothrops transcriptome contained four transcripts for pla2s , including a lys- <dig> myotoxin   and a weak neurotoxin similar to trimucrotoxin  <cit>   . pla <dig>  <dig>  accounted for  <dig> % of all transcripts, while pla <dig>  <dig> amounted to an additional  <dig> % . the ovophis transcriptome contained two pla <dig> transcripts; however, the more abundant transcript, pla <dig>  <dig>  comprised only  <dig> % of the transcriptome  . peptides sequenced by mass spectrometry covered  <dig> % of pla <dig>  <dig>  but no peptides were found for the minor transcript.


serine proteases

of the  <dig> sp transcripts in the protobothrops library , only two   can be confirmed as complete . several transcripts appear to encode dysfunctional sps. for instance, sp <dig> encodes  <dig> residues and is bracketed on both ends by stop codons . given that it was expressed at a very low level and that no peptides were sequenced by mass spectrometry, we think it is unlikely to play any role in envenomation.

sp <dig>  the most abundant sp transcript, corresponds to a protein that appears in the literature under the names of habutobin  <cit>  and flavoxobin  <cit> , a weakly thrombin-like enzyme of  <dig> amino acids that specifically releases fibrinopeptide a from fibrinogen  <cit> . no information is available with regard to possible kallikrein-like activity. however, yamamoto et al.  <cit>  found that flavoxobin is an active c3-convertase that selectively releases c3b and c3a. it remains active in blood containing endogenous protease inhibitors, and promotes massive c <dig> consumption, and to a lesser extent, c <dig> cleavage. a kinin-releasing enzyme, flavoviridiobin, is also known from this venom  <cit> ; however, since no sequence data are available, we cannot identify it among our transcripts. enzymatic digests of crude venom effected with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and glu-c  yielded peptides that accounted for  <dig> % of the primary structure of sp <dig> . reasonable peptide coverage of transcripts as minor as  <dig> %  was achieved .

in contrast to the protobothrops library, the ovophis library contained transcripts for  <dig> different sps . peptide coverage of 36% or above was achieved for  <dig> of these, with coverage above 70% for  <dig> of them. two transcripts  appear to be plasminogen activators, while sp <dig> is most similar to a kinin-releasing enzyme from the venom of bothrops jararaca. serine proteases display numerous amino acid substitutions, and the structural determinants that specifically account for kinin-releasing activity are unknown  <cit> . the difficulty in assigning pharmacological activities to specific sequence variations is immediately apparent upon a cursory examination of additional file 11: figure s <dig> and additional file 12: figure s <dig> 

wu et al.  <cit>  reported a novel class of inactive serine protease homologs  that displayed an arginine substitution for his- <dig> of the catalytic triad. sp <dig> was the only serine protease in our protobothrops library that showed this his → arg mutation ; however, the ovophis library contained eight transcripts with his → x substitutions . two of these, sp <dig> and sp <dig> showed his → lys substitutions; two putative thrombin-like enzymes, sp <dig> and sp <dig> displayed his → asn substitutions, and sp <dig> had a his → ala substitution. numerous other sequence differences appear in that transcript as well . sphs from other sources have been shown to possess diverse activities, so it is possible that inactive sps in venoms have developed other unknown functions, some of which may be specialized for particular prey types.

an inactive catalytic triad is but one of many structural differences manifested by ovophis sphs . almost all of the cysteine residues are in different positions as well , although within the group, most residues are conserved across most sequences. sp <dig> is a marked exception in the latter regard . another oddity among these sequences is that four of them  are truncated c-terminally with stop codons, despite the fact that sp <dig> and  <dig> display expression levels of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. wang et al.  <cit>  reported that a kentucky population of crotalus horridus lacks an acidic pla <dig> because the codon for tyr <dig> has mutated into a stop codon. they concluded that low pla <dig> expression levels in most crotalus horridus venoms can be attributed to translation blockage. at this point, it is difficult to know how widespread this phenomenon might be, but it is apparent that these two ovophis sps are translated effectively since they had ample peptide coverage .


l-amino acid oxidase

the protobothrops transcriptome included two transcripts for l-amino acid oxidase , comprising  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all transcripts, respectively . a single lao transcript was present in ovophis glands , representing  <dig> % of the transcriptome . peptides accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of protobothrops lao  <dig> and lao  <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> % of the ovophis lao transcript sequence was identified by mass spectrometry .

minor venom constituents

cysteine-rich secretory proteins

two crisps were identified in the protobothrops transcriptome . crisp  <dig> ,  for which a complete transcript was obtained, is identical to triflin  <cit> , but crisp  <dig>  aligns best with a crisp bearing an egf-like calcium-binding domain from the venom of crotalus adamanteus <cit>  . however, the putative 39-residue egf domain in the c. adamanteus toxin does not align well with the corresponding region of the protobothrops transcript. the latter contains only four acidic residues, compared with nine in the c. adamanteus sequence. only three of the five c. adamanteus cysteine residues match, and the two sequences require a two-residue gap to achieve even this poor alignment. therefore, we think it unlikely that there is a functional egf-like calcium binding domain in the protobothrops toxin. moreover, no peptides were sequenced for this odd crisp, whereas  <dig> % of crisp  <dig> was sequenced.

a single, complete crisp transcript  was identified in the ovophis transcriptome  , but sequenced peptides accounted for  <dig> % of its primary structure. it was most similar to a crisp from the venom of bothriechis schlegelii .

crisps are generally not abundant components of snake venoms, but they are widely distributed taxonomically. ablomin , triflin  and latisemin  are l-type ca2+ channel antagonists of depolarization-induced arterial smooth muscle contraction, but they do not affect caffeine-induced contraction  <cit> ; thus they promote vasodilation and hypotension. tigrin from “venom” of the japanese colubrid, rhabdophis tigrinus, affected neither. this is probably because rhabdophis venom glands are not secretory in nature. instead, rhabdophis glands sequester toxins from the blood stream that are derived from the toads that rhabdophis eats  <cit> . thus, tigrin is most likely an amphibian toxin, intended for oral or gastric activity, and not a snake toxin, designed for direct vascular action. in contrast, patagonin, a crisp isolated from the venom of the colubrid, philodryas patagoniensis, damaged murine skeletal muscle  <cit> .


nerve growth factor

both habu transcriptomes contained a single, complete transcript for nerve growth factor  . the protobothrops transcript accounted for  <dig> % of all transcripts while the ovophis transcript accounted for  <dig> %. both transcripts are translated and peptides were isolated by mass spectrometry. ngfs function as arginine esterases  <cit> , so they probably contribute to venom hypotensive activity via nitric oxide liberation and histamine release  <cit> . mouse salivary ngfs activate plasminogen, their only known action upon a biologically important, non-neural substrate  <cit> , but it is not clear whether snake venom ngfs can also do this. if so, they would hinder blood clotting.


c-type lectins

snake venom c-type lectins, or snaclecs  <cit>  are commonly found in pit viper venoms. these proteins differ from classical c-type lectins in that they lack the calcium and sugar-binding loop and instead bind to a large variety of proteins and receptors involved in hemostasis, including coagulation factors ix and x and various blood platelet receptors  <cit> . they may consist of one, two, or four αβ heterodimers, and in some cases, the heterodimer is incorporated into a metalloprotease  <cit> . in many ctls, dimers are formed by domain swapping between subunits  <cit> .

ctl pharmacology is quite complex. taniuchi et al.  <cit>  found that flavocetin a actually induces formation of small platelet aggregates, but the dose-dependency is bell-shaped, with a maximum effectiveness at 1-2 μg/ml. clemetson  <cit>  lamented that because so much venom research is now done at the transcriptional level, the protein chemistry and pharmacology necessary to understand ctl diversity has lagged way behind. in reality, the same could also be said of any other toxin family that shows significant diversification, such as 3ftxs, sps, mps, and pla2s.

venom c-type lectins may activate platelets or inhibit platelet activation, but either mechanism serves the function of inducing thrombocytopenia. because c-type lectins are non-enzymatic, a 1: <dig> stoichiometry exists between these toxins and their targets. clemetson  <cit>  noted that for this reason, it is much more efficient to clear platelets by activating them than by inhibiting them. however, different species of snakes employ both strategies, and it is probably necessary to look at all the toxins in a given venom that impact hemostasis, before drawing any conclusions.

twelve protobothrops ctl transcripts included three α-chains and three β-chains homologous to flavocetin a, an  <dig> inhibitor of von willibrand factor-induced, gp1b-mediated platelet aggregation  <cit>  and convulxin, a potent  <dig> inducer of platelet aggregation that binds to gpvi  <cit>  . one of the flavocetin a-like α-chains  and ctl <dig> f ix/x displayed a number of sequence differences, including an unusual c-terminus . whether these have any pharmacological significance is unknown. in addition to toxins that target blood platelets, there were five a chains and one b chain for proteins that bind to coagulation factors ix/x . factor ix/x binding proteins inhibit blood coagulation by blocking the host clotting cascade  <cit> .

seven ovophis ctl transcripts apparently all encode proteins that affect platelet activation . they are homologous to flavocetin a and convulxin. we did not discover any ovophis transcripts that encode anticoagulant factor ix/x-binding proteins. our ovophis cdna library contained one α-chain, ctl1α, similar to the α-chain of flavocetin a  and the convulxin a- and c-chains  . ctl1α is most like crotacetin . together these seven ctls represented  <dig> % of all transcripts.


bradykinin-potentiating peptides

a single bradykinin-potentiating peptide  was sequenced from protobothrops venom using mass spectrometry  , confirming the existence of a bpp proposed by higuchi et al.  <cit> , on the basis of a cdna transcript. a second possible bpp  was also sequenced, but to date, no other bpps have been found with proline immediately after the n-terminal pyroglutamic acid, making this sequence suspect. moreover, the vvv-sequence, n-terminal to the glutamine, and the c-terminal aggtta-sequence are highly questionable. possibly this peptide could be processed to qphesp. this possible bpp is located at the c-terminus of our bpp transcript; however, our bpp transcript is incomplete, since it lacks a stop codon and it does not include the c-type natriuretic peptide-coding region reported by higuchi et al.  <cit>  .

our protobothrops transcript  also contains the second bpp sequence reported by higuchi et al.  <cit> , although this bpp was not identified by mass spectrometry. they posited the existence of two bpps based on the assumptions that such sequences should possess glutamine at the n-terminus and proline at the c-terminus, and should be about  <dig> residues in length. in fact, bpps from three to  <dig> residues have been reported  <cit>  . both the higuchi protobothrops transcript and ours suggest another probable bpp with the sequence qwmpggrpphhipp . the gloydius transcript of higuchi et al.  <cit>  also contains a tripeptide  that occurs in five locations at the end of the bpps that they predicted . two tripeptides from bothrops insularis venom having pyroglutamic acid at the n-terminus  were sequenced by cintra et al.  <cit> , and these peptides were shown to have bradykinin-potentiating activity on guinea pig ileum . it is possible that the peptide qws is likewise biologically active. other tripeptides are found in the higuchi protobothrops and gloydius transcripts and in our ovophis transcript. these have the sequences qer  and qar  . all of these are immediately n-terminal to nonapeptides that could also be bpps . these sequences are as follows: pf, qkwgrmvqp; gb, qnwarmvnp; oo, qkwgrmvpp.

in addition to being truncated on the c-terminal end relative to the higuchi transcript, our transcript displays a significant n-terminal extension, containing three additional possible bpps . these have the sequences qrrvhggeriwp, qsarldstrlgsap, srppslpapaqp; however, additional work will be necessary to determine whether these sequences are actually hypotensive and whether they are actually expressed in habu venom.

our ovophis bpp transcript  displayed a c-terminal stop codon, but was incomplete on the n-terminal end. however, the ovophis transcript did contain a sequence for a c-type natriuretic peptide  that was identical to that reported for gloydius blomhoffii venom  <cit>  . it differed at five residues from the higuchi protobothrops transcript .

when mass spectrometry was used to analyze crude ovophis venom for the presence of bpps, the sequence rppgppipp, and derivative forms thereof  were isolated. this sequence does not occur in our truncated transcript; however, it is nearly identical to a proposed bpp from the n-terminal end of a bpp-cnp transcript from gloydius blomhoffii   <cit>  and from bothrops jararaca venoms  <cit>  .

potency of bradykinin-potentiating peptides  increases ~200-fold if the c-terminal proline residue is doubled  <cit> . while the c-terminal tripeptide of a bpp from gloydius halys venom was shown to be essential for its activity, removal of the n-terminal pyroglutamate residue made it twice as potent  <cit> ; thus, while the n-terminal pyroglutamate common to bpps  may prevent their rapid degradation by prey aminopeptidases, it is actually an impediment to bradykinin potentiation. interestingly, bradykinin-potentiating activity is not correlated with inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme  activity  <cit> , which is much too slow to be relevant to envenomation.

various studies have shown that bradykinin potentiation and inhibition of somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme  by pit viper hypotensive peptides are independent biochemical activities  <cit> . the presence of paired proline residues at the c-terminus and a pyroglutamic acid residue at the n-terminus are not the only requirements for bradykinin-potentiating activity or sace inhibition. guerreiro et al.  <cit>  have shown that argininosuccinate synthetase is activated by a bpp from bothrops jararaca venom, indicating that nitric oxide formation represents yet another means by which bpps promote hypotensive shock to limit prey flight  <cit> .


phospholipase b

phospholipase b  activity was first reported in snake venoms by doery and pearson  <cit> , who confirmed its presence in the venoms of naja naja, pseudechis porphyriacus, and agkistrodon piscivorus. in  <dig>  plb from pseudechis colletti venom was characterized for the first time  <cit> . no venom plb sequences were reported until  <dig>  when transcripts were isolated from venoms of drysdalia coronoides <cit>  and crotalus adamanteus <cit> . while plb accounted for only  <dig> % of all transcripts in those species, it represented  <dig> % of protobothrops , and  <dig> % of ovophis transcripts  . peptides covering  <dig> % of the protobothrops sequence and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the two ovophis sequences, respectively, were isolated by mass spectrometry . to the best of our knowledge, these are the first protein sequence data for any snake venom plb.

feola et al.  <cit>  found that in rabbits, i.v. injections of phosphatidylethanolamine  and phosphatidylserine  caused significant hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, bronchospasm, activation of intravascular coagulation, complement, platelets, and leukocytes with release of histamine, serotonin, and thromboxane at a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg and caused cardiac arrest and death at a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg. all of these effects are consistent with snake venom envenomation strategies  <cit> ; however, it is not clear whether intact pe and ps are released from cell membranes by pit viper venoms. kinoshita et al.  <cit>  found that ps and pe were not released from membranes by purified protobothrops flavoviridis phospholipase a2; however, one would not really expect this, and venoms contain many other components in addition to phospholipase a <dig>  what is more, prey tissue destruction by venom components liberates many endogenous compounds, further complicating the picture. at present, the role of plb in envenomation remains unclear, beyond its generalized hydrolysis of cell membrane phospholipids.


phosphodiesterase

the protobothrops transcriptome contained four phosphodiesterase  transcripts, ranging from  <dig> - <dig> % of all transcripts , which comprised, in aggregate,  <dig> % of the transcriptome . peptides covering  <dig> - <dig> % of the four pde sequences were sequenced by ms. pde was less diversified in ovophis . two pde transcripts accounted for a negligible portion of the ovophis transcriptome . sequenced peptides accounted for only  <dig> - <dig> % of the two pde sequences.


vascular endothelial growth factor-like proteins

five vegf isoforms comprised just over  <dig> % of all ovophis transcripts , while three protobothrops transcripts totaled  <dig> % of that transcriptome  . fourteen unique peptides were isolated for protobothrops vegf  <dig>  accounting for  <dig> % of its sequence. fourteen peptides were also sequenced from ovophis vegf  <dig>  amounting to  <dig> % coverage .

both venomes contain transcripts for several structural subclasses of vegfs, although owing to the great diversification of these sequences, classification is difficult. for instance, ovophis vegf  <dig> possesses a 24-residue insert seen in no other sequence . ovophis vegf  <dig> and  <dig> and protobothrops vegf  <dig> all possess long c-terminal extensions and align well with human vegf-a <dig> . ovophis vegf  <dig> is the most heavily expressed vegf in that venome, at  <dig> % . human vegf-a binds to fms-like tyrosine kinase- <dig>   and to kinase insert domain-containing receptor , but not to vegfr- <dig>   <cit> . vegf-a induces vasodilation mediated by nitric oxide  <cit>  and increases vascular permeability  <dig> -fold more potently than histamine  <cit> . in addition, vegf-a promotes tachycardia, hypotension, and diminished cardiac output when injected i.v. in rats  <cit> . it is likely that ovophis vegf 1- <dig> and protobothrops vegf  <dig> have similar pharmacology, as these symptoms are consonant with snake envenomation strategies  <cit> .

ovophis vegf  <dig>  and protobothrops vegf  <dig>  are homologous to vammin, from the venom of vipera ammodytes. all three of these display short c-terminal extensions of 16- <dig> residues that bind heparin  <cit>  . vammin specifically recognizes vegfr- <dig>  <cit> . both vammin and vr- <dig>  a vegf from daboia russellii venom, enhance vascular permeability with greater potency than does vegf-a <dig> <cit> . additionally, yamazaki et al.  <cit>  have shown that a lys- <dig> pla <dig> without catalytic activity further enhances the vascular-permeability promoting capacity of vammin.

ovophis vegf3- <dig> and protobothrops vegf <dig> comprise a subclass with no c-terminal extension, or an extremely short extension corresponding to the c-terminus of ovophis vegf 1- <dig> and protobothrops vegf <dig> . these are significantly shorter than barietin from the venom of bitis arietans <cit> , and they do not align well with it or with vammin .


5’-nucleotidase

both transcriptomes included a single transcript for 5’-nucleotidase  . in both transcriptomes 5’-nucleotidase was a negligible constituent. mass spectrometry identified  <dig> venom peptides accounting for  <dig> % of the expected sequence of the mature protobothrops protein, while  <dig> unique peptides were detected in ovophis venom, accounting for  <dig> % of the 5’-nucleotidase in that venom.

5’-nucleotidase is ubiquitous in snake venoms  <cit> , suggesting a central role in envenomation. this enzyme is known to cleave a wide variety of ribose- and deoxyribose-containing nucleotides  <cit> . it is most active against amp  <cit>  supporting the central role of adenosine in envenomation proposed by aird  <cit> . 5’-nucleotidase does not cleave flavin mononucleotide, or camp; however, these are hydrolyzed by venom pde.


galactose-binding lectins

in contrast to c-type lectin-like proteins , galactose-binding lectins  possess intact calcium and galactose-binding loops  <cit> . gbls are similar in size to ctl-like proteins and are also dimeric. however, instead of interacting with platelets, gbls aggregate erythrocytes  <cit> . for this reason, most authors, starting with gartner et al.  <cit> , have assumed that the presence of gbls in venom is related to envenomation; however, several lines of evidence raise the possibility of a role unrelated to prey immobilization or digestion  <cit> .

gbls have been shown to be strongly mitogenic  <cit> . their mitosis-inducing effects on lymphocytes were found to be comparable to those of concanavalin a  <cit> . fry and wüster  <cit>  noted that gbls appear to be basal phylogenetically among venomous snakes, whereas ctl-like proteins appear only in the viperidae. unlike ctl-like proteins, gbls display very little sequence variability, suggesting that they are not under selective pressure to diversify, as ctl-like proteins are  <cit> . lectins with similar sugar specificity are found in many tissues  <cit> . in protobothrops and ovophis, gbls are expressed at very low levels  . ogilvie et al.  <cit>  likewise found low expression levels for gbls in bothrops atrox  and dendroaspis jamesonii  venoms, with a somewhat higher level  in lachesis muta venom. lomonte et al.  <cit>  found that the gbl from cerrophidion godmani venom exhibited edema-forming activity in mice, but concluded that with its low potency and low abundance, it probably plays relatively little role in envenomation. the aforementioned data suggest that gbls may exist in venom as mitogens to regulate synthetic activity in the glandular epithelium itself. if this view is correct, hemagglutinating and edematogenic activities would be fortuitous, but of secondary importance. nonetheless, the relative importance of such activities might vary among taxa.


aminopeptidases

aminopeptidase n plays a significant role in preventing hypertension by degrading angiotensin iii to angiotensin iv  <cit> . the role of aminopeptidase a in blood pressure regulation appears to be more complex. apa degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin iii  <cit> . when acting at peripheral sites, angiotensin iii is less potent hypertensive than angiotensin ii  <cit> , but in central sites, angiotensin iii raises blood pressure more effectively than angiotensin ii  <cit> .

various lines of evidence suggest a role for apa in promoting hypotension in situations analogous to envenomation. systemic administration of apa in spontaneously hypertensive rats  <cit>  or hypertensive rats infused with angiotensin ii  <cit>  reduced their blood pressure. administration of amastatin, an apa inhibitor, raised blood pressure in normotensive rats  <cit> .

to date nominal aminopeptidases a and n have been isolated from pit viper venoms, although expression levels appear to be generally low, and many venoms apparently may not contain either. in the present study, ovophis venom contained a complete transcript for aminopeptidase a , while protobothrops venom contained two apa transcripts . however, the ovophis aminopeptidase a transcript comprised only  <dig> % of all transcripts, while the two more abundant protobothrops transcripts together comprised  <dig> %; hence both are very minor venom constituents. ovophis apa and protobothrops apa  <dig> were closely related to that reported from gloydius brevicaudus venom  <cit> , differing at only  <dig> and  <dig> residues out of  <dig>  respectively.

tu and toom  <cit>  found that nearly all venoms hydrolyze l-leucyl-β-naphthylamide, but that there exists great variation in activity levels. aird  <cit>  suggested that the principal function of leucine aminopeptidase   is digestive and that it links the hemorrhagic venom metalloproteases and other venom and endogenous prey peptidases, to l-amino acid oxidase in order to potentiate h2o <dig> liberation, resulting in hypotension and anticoagulation. it is probable that numerous other amino- and carboxypeptidases in plasma also pass free amino acids to lao. clearly the release of leu from circulating peptides is not solely dependent upon venom lap. this may partly explain the variation in lap levels that exists among different venoms  <cit> . if lap is abundant in prey tissues, there may not be great selection pressure governing its level of expression in venoms. in the two transcriptomes, lap was a very minor component  .

the protobothrops transcriptome possessed two aminopeptidases that show similarity to aminopeptidase n  , but some of these did not manifest much similarity to the two gloydius brevicaudus enzymes  <cit> . they also showed similarity to aminopeptidase a, so without careful biochemical analyses it is impossible to classify them precisely. furthermore, it may be that the aminopeptidase nomenclatural system devised for use with human enzymes, may not be applicable to snake venom aminopeptidases.


dipeptidyl peptidase iv

dipeptidyl peptidase iv  was first discovered in venoms of various micrurus species by jorge da silva and aird  <cit> . it was also detected in the venoms of two other elapids, bungarus multicinctus, naja naja, and in that of the brazilian crotaline, bothrops moojeni. dpp iv titers varied by more than 4x among the different venoms. dpp iv is believed to function in envenomation by blunting a hypertensive response on the part of envenomated prey  <cit> . ogawa et al.  <cit>  published the first snake venom dpp iv primary structures, a pair of isomeric sequences derived from cdna libraries of gloydius brevicaudus venom glands. they determined that the signal peptide was not removed from these sequences. later ogawa et al.  <cit> , showed that dpp iv, is actually secreted membrane-bound in exosomes. these micro-vesicles probably account for the “pre-peak” that elutes well ahead of the largest proteins when snake venoms are fractionated using gel filtration chromatography  <cit> . exosomes were later shown to be present in human saliva as well  <cit> . dpp iv is nearly ubiquitous among elapid and viperid venoms, but it exhibits great quantitative variability even among full siblings  <cit> .

the protobothrops flavoviridis dpp iv sequence  comprises  <dig> residues, like those from gloydius, while the ovophis sequence has  <dig> . nonetheless, the protobothrops and ovophis sequences are more similar to each other than to the gloydius sequences . the protobothrops sequence is missing one of a pair of asparagine residues present in the other three sequences, but both the protobothrops and ovophis sequences have a leucine residue that is missing in the gloydius sequences . no dpp iv peptides were discovered with mass spectrometry following enzymatic digestion of protobothrops venom; however, three unique peptides accounting for  <dig> % of the ovophis dpp iv sequence were isolated. venoms were well centrifuged before sample digestion, which probably pelleted the exosomes; thus it is surprising that any ovophis peptides were identified.


glutaminyl cyclase

qc cyclizes, and thereby protects the n-termini of biologically active peptides, such as the bpps  <cit> , some metalloproteases  <cit> , and the b and c chains of the acidic subunit of crotoxin homologs  <cit> . no direct role in envenomation has been suggested for qc to date. however, while cyclization protects these peptides against degradation by prey plasma aminopeptidases, in the case of bpps, bradykinin-potentiating potency is reduced by half  <cit> .

a total of five snake venom qc cdnas have been sequenced to date. two of these belong to colubrids of the genus boiga <cit>  and the other three have been sequenced from crotalids on three different continents .

the present study adds eight additional sequences, of which a couple are distinctly different from those previously published. the protobothrops sample contained four qc transcripts for two pairs of toxins . the two identical long protobothrops transcripts show near identity with other published crotalid sequences . however, as confirmed by the presence of stop codons, two other identical short sequences are missing the n-terminal  <dig> residues of the longer sequences. the next eight residues of the short sequences are unique, but thereafter they are identical to the long sequences . pawlak and kini  <cit>  reported a similar, though less extensive deletion in the boiga dendrophila qc; thus it is clear that this sort of alternate splicing/post-translational modification is characteristic of snake venom qcs. ovophis venom also contains four qc sequences , but because all are incomplete, no conclusions can be drawn regarding their length. the most highly expressed of these four represented only  <dig> % of all transcripts , consistent with an indirect role in envenomation. peptides were isolated for all four protobothrops qcs, but only one of the ovophis isoforms.


hyaluronidase

hyaluronidase is not a major constituent of either venom. a single complete transcript was found in the protobothrops library , while two complete ovophis transcripts were sequenced . no hyaluronidase transcript was more abundant than the cutoff for contaminants and no peptides were isolated from either venom. venom hyaluronidase has been deemed a “spreading factor” because its degradation of the extracellular matrix enables other venom constituents, such as metalloproteases and phospholipases, to attack additional tissues  <cit> . as such, hyaluronidase probably serves primarily to digest the prey.


three-finger toxins

protobothrops venom, but apparently not that of ovophis, contains a three-finger toxin  . this sequence is most closely related to a transcript reported from sistrurus catenatus edwardsi venom  <cit>  and to candoxin isolated from the venom of an elapid, bungarus candidus <cit>  . 3ftxs were not detected in an earlier study of sistrurus catenatus barbouri venom  <cit> , and they have not been observed in many other venomics studies of pit vipers  <cit> . other studies have located 3ftxs by transcriptomic means, but not by proteomics approaches  <cit> . this is not surprising, given their low expression levels in many taxa . while 3ftxs are minor components of most pit viper venoms, relatively high expression levels have been reported in some species. in a study of caribbean pit vipers, using roche  <dig> sequencing technology, durban et al.  <cit>  reported considerable variability .

the protobothrops 3ftx differs slightly in its disulfide bond structure from all known 3ftxs . it shares a cysteine residue in position  <dig> with the 3ftx from sistrurus catenatus edwardsi venom; however, cys- <dig>  which is linked to cys- <dig> in the sistrurus toxin, in the deinagkistrodon acutus short neurotoxin, and in candoxin, occurs at position  <dig> in the protobothrops toxin .


enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis

aird  <cit>  explained the neuromodulatory and hypotensive roles of purine nucleosides in the pharmacology of snake envenomation. a later study quantified purine and pyrimidine nucleosides in a wide variety of elapid, viperid, and crotalid venoms  <cit> . possible roles of uridine and cytidine in envenomation are less clear than those of purine nucleosides. because nucleosides are endogenous regulatory substances in all vertebrates, it is impossible for any prey species to develop resistance to them; thus they represent the perfect predatory biochemical weapon. however, their endogenous nature also means that the enzymes involved in nucleoside biosynthesis would be expected in any venom gland transcriptome, regardless of whether nucleosides are actually secreted into the venom in quantities relevant to envenomation. as a result, no venomics studies to date have specifically looked for the presence of nucleoside biosynthetic enzymes. instead they have been treated as “housekeeping” genes. in fact, only rokyta et al.  <cit>  have reported the sequences of adenylosuccinate synthetase, adenylosuccinate lyase, imp dehydrogenase, gmp synthetase, nucleoside monophosphate kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, or ctp synthetase.

in both transcriptomes, we found transcripts for all four of the enzymes required to synthesize amp and gmp from imp  . the monophosphates may then be dephosphorylated by a variety of non-specific phosphatases or by venom or endogenous prey 5’-nucleotidase. regarding pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes, nucleoside diphosphate kinase  and ctp synthetase  were found in both transcriptomes, but nucleoside monophosphate kinase was detected only in protobothrops . all of these sequences were identical or nearly so to those reported by rokyta et al.  <cit> .

unfortunately, because both species in the present study are crotalids, the confirmation of nucleoside biosynthetic enzymes in the venome was less interesting than it might have been. the crotalid envenomation strategy involves liberation of endogenous prey purine nucleosides, but the venoms themselves have a minimal nucleoside content  <cit> . in contrast, some viperid venoms and mamba venoms may contain nearly 9% purines by dry weight  <cit> . thus in crotalid venomes, nucleoside biosynthetic enzymes probably are largely metabolic in function. it would be interesting to examine the transcript levels of these enzymes in bitis or dendroaspis venoms by comparison. direct analysis of venom nucleoside levels would be required to determine what level of mrna expression corresponds to a departure from metabolic function to envenomation.


acid phosphomonoesterase

acid pme comprised a negligible percentage of all transcripts in both venoms  . the sequences were most closely related to a tissue pme from anolis carolinensis. to the best of our knowledge, these are the first snake acid pme mrna sequences reported.


acetylcholinesterase

the ovophis transcriptome included five acetylcholinesterase  transcripts that collectively amounted to less than the contaminant cutoff for venom gland transcripts, so its presence in the transcriptome may be accidental  . ache activity is considered characteristic of most elapid, but not viperid venoms. ache transcripts have been reported recently in selected colubrid and dipsadid venoms  <cit> . these are the first reported crotalid transcripts.


homologs of crotamine, gap and crotasin

crotamine, a highly basic 42-residue myotoxin was first reported 75 years ago  <cit>  in the venom of crotalus durissus terrificus. homologs were later discovered in various other rattlesnake venoms  <cit> . these proteins display perplexing geographic distributional patterns  <cit>  and individual quantitative variation  <cit> , and they are products of duplicated loci  <cit> . their physiological targets have remained controversial  <cit>  and new biochemical activities continue to be discovered  <cit> . myotoxin a, a crotamine homolog from the venom of crotalus viridis viridis, was shown to undergo temperature-sensitive conformational transitions owing to cis-trans isomerization of pro- <dig>  <cit> . it is unknown whether the isomers bind to different physiological targets.

marquardt et al.  <cit>  patented a crotamine homolog called gap  with mitosis-arresting activity. it was isolated from the venom of crotalus atrox, which, to date, has not been reported to contain a small myotoxin. gap seems to have gone unnoticed by the toxinological community for the past 24 years, but crotasin, a crotamine homolog with some of the structural features of gap was reported by radís-baptista et al.  <cit> .

the present study isolated two gap/crotasin-like transcripts from the ovophis transcriptome  , but no crotamine- or crotasin-like sequence was found in the protobothrops transcriptome. crotasin/gap-like proteins are significantly less basic than the crotamine-like proteins, and they lack a phe-pro dipeptide , as well as the n-terminal tyr of the latter. the two ovophis transcripts differ very significantly from each other and from both gap and crotasin . though the exact location of the n-terminal residue cannot be determined with certainty, they both apparently possess the n-terminal disulfide bond present in crotamine and gap, but absent in crotasin, and they are comparable in length to crotamine and gap. crotasin lacks the n-terminal eight residues of crotamine homologs. however, the signal peptide sequence for various crotamine isomers  <cit>  exactly matches the signal peptide sequences of our ovophis crotasin/gap homologs. both ovophis transcripts manifested near-zero transcription levels, so it seems unlikely that these are functional venom components, but it is clear that the sequence diversification that oguiura et al.  <cit>  reported, applies to these transcripts as well.


waprins

waprins belong to a family of proteins with diverse activities that are structurally related to whey acidic protein  <cit> . other members of the family have anti-bacterial activity and protease inhibitory activity  <cit> . waprins discovered to date are small proteins of about  <dig> amino acids, containing four disulfide bonds  <cit> . clauss et al.  <cit>  identified a segment of human chromosome  <dig>  displaying  <dig> genes for proteins related to whey acidic protein. they postulated that the resulting gene products could potentially serve an anti-microbial function against pathogenic bacteria, or that they might participate in the regulation of endogenous proteases. they also opined that kallikrein-like proteases are of particular interest.

the protease inhibitory capacity of members of this family suggests possible roles in envenomation, though to date, no evidence has been presented for any of these functions. snake venom proteins belonging to the kunitz/bpti family have been modified to serve as ion channel inhibitors  <cit>  and to chaperone neurotoxic pla2s  <cit> . bpps inhibit angiotensin i-converting enzyme to promote hypotension  <cit> , but also may act directly upon other physiological targets to induce hypotension  <cit> . some of the bradykinin-potentiating peptides serve an interesting dual role by inhibiting hemorrhagic metalloproteases in the venom gland  <cit> .

pahari et al.  <cit>  reported the first viperid waprin-like protein in the venom glands of sistrurus catenatus edwardsi. however, the putative sistrurus toxin comprised a waprin domain fused to a kunitz/bpti domain. the function of the encoded protein is unknown. it was represented by only a single transcript, so it is difficult to say whether this toxin is biologically significant. this non-enzymatic toxin was expressed at near-zero levels.

rokyta et al.  <cit>  reported a full-length waprin transcript in the venom of crotalus adamanteus. both the protobothrops and ovophis transcriptomes contained transcripts that were strongly homologous to the crotalus waprin  . interestingly, the ovophis waprin has a c-terminal pro-met, instead of the usual pro-leu/val-pro. one peptide representing 28% of the transcript sequence was isolated .

both venoms also contained sequences that are related to the kunitz serine protease inhibitor domain of the novel ku-wap hybrid toxin from sistrurus catenatus edwardsi venom  <cit>  . all of these transcripts are incomplete and the three n-terminal transcripts show relatively little overlap with the region of fusion in the sistrurus ku-wap toxin; however, all three of the putative ku-wap homologs show the acidic and basic residues  and other features of the kunitz domain of the sistrurus toxin . they do not show strong homology to either α-dendrotoxin  <cit>  or to bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor . they may be additional examples of the ku-wap family; however, they appear to be most closely related to vertebrate inhibitors of the tissue factor pathway.


putative inhibitors of tissue factor pathway

in vertebrates, blood coagulation is initiated by the tissue factor  pathway. this pathway is regulated primarily by tissue factor pathway inhibitor , a kunitz serine protease inhibitor that inhibits factor xa and thrombin at concentrations as low as  <dig>  nm, thus controlling the generation of thrombin and ultimately, of fibrin  <cit> . platelet tfpi is believed to modulate intravascular coagulation  <cit> .

the protobothrops transcriptome contained a single, partial transcript  and the ovophis transcriptome contained two, very short, identical transcripts  that align well with a predicted anolis tfpi, and less well with the ku-wap fusion toxin from sistrurus catenatus edwardsi venom glands and with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor . the protobothrops tfpi transcript aligns well with both the acidic n-terminus and the highly basic c-terminus of human tfpiα  <cit>  .

all three transcripts are expressed at vanishingly low levels  and it seems extremely unlikely that they function in envenomation; however, peptides ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the protobothrops and ovophis sequences were isolated. most likely, these are tissue transcripts related to snake vascular homeostasis. if they serve any additional roles, they might inhibit venom sps in the gland, or they might inhibit prey thrombin, allowing venom sps to clot fibrinogen improperly, resulting in its rapid clearance by the prey's anti-clotting cascade.


paraoxonase

paraoxon hydrolytic activity has been reported only in the venom of daboia russellii to date  <cit> . venoms of naja naja, crotalus adamanteus, and agkistrodon contortrix contortrix showed only trace level activity by comparison. three genes comprise the paraoxonase gene family in humans. pon <dig> is largely associated with high-density lipoprotein, but has organophosphatase, arylesterase, or lactonase activities, and it hydrolyzes a wide array of substrates  <cit> . pon <dig> and pon <dig> are not well studied, but pon <dig> is known to be a widely-distributed cellular enzyme. two transcripts were found in the protobothrops transcriptome, but none in ovophis. both protobothrops transcripts were expressed at near-zero levels, suggesting that paraoxonase is not a venom component in either of these species. the protobothrops paraoxonase isozymes share diagnostic residues with all three human isozymes and are not clearly related to any one of them .


vespryns

pung et al.  <cit>  isolated a novel 12 kda toxin from the venom of the king cobra that acts centrally to induce hypolocomotion and pain in mammalian prey. a toxin from lachesis muta venom  <cit>  was the first crotalid vespryn and a second was sequenced from crotalus adamanteus venom  <cit> . the protobothrops transcriptome contained a partial, 70-residue vespryn transcript , but the ovophis transcriptome had none . no vespryn peptides were sequenced. the protobothrops vespryn is most closely related to that from lachesis, which also displays a four-residue gap from positions 25- <dig>  only three of the first  <dig> residues differ between these two toxins. the three crotalid vespryns are all 28- <dig> residues longer at the n-terminus than the two corresponding toxins from ophiophagus hannah and pseudechis australis venoms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using two distantly related pit viper species with different venom compositions, our study illustrates the power of using next generation sequencing in combination with lc/ms profiling for the study of venom chemistry. we were able to detect a wide variety of venom components in both cdna and in the venom itself. except for the annotation of protein function, the analytic pipeline was entirely self-contained and did not rely on publicly available reference databases. given the decreasing costs of sequencing, and the increasing power of mass spectrometry, this approach will be increasingly useful for poorly studied species that have no previously published reference data, and also for detecting fundamentally new venom components that might have been missed by earlier investigations.

we show, for the first time, that the composition of venom gland mrna is linearly correlated with protein composition of the venom. although this finding is fairly trivial by itself, especially given the amount of unexplained variance observed in our correlation, it has several interesting methodological implications. it appears that peptide detection with lc/ms can potentially be used to quantify individual proteins in venoms. this can allow high-throughput screening of numerous venom samples providing comparative data on the abundance of various components. although probably not as sensitive or quantitative as cdna sequencing, at least without further refinement, this approach permits non-invasive sampling, which will be important for rare or endangered species. crude venom is also easier to collect and store than rna, making it possible to collect numerous samples in the field, or to use archived venom samples. we are currently conducting studies focused on improving the accuracy of lc/ms-based venom peptide sampling and quantification, and on developing better metrics.

we obtained similarly quantitative results using de novo assembled transcriptomes and publicly available data from ncbi for protein identification . this finding makes mass spectrometry useful even for species without custom-made species-specific reference transcriptomes. although using publicly available data prevents the discovery of novel proteins, public data should be particularly useful for comparative studies, and for investigation of snakes for which transcriptomes cannot be obtained for whatever reason.

with regard to the utility of using mass spectrometry for non-invasive, quantitative sampling, another pair of studies report the isolation of intact mrna directly from venoms  <cit> . it remains to be seen how quantitative this technique will prove to be and how useful it will be for archival samples, especially those that have been repeatedly frozen and thawed, but certainly it offers exciting possibilities, especially in combination with mass spectrometry.

the present study reports  <dig> venom or venom-related cdna sequences from the venom glands of protobothrops flavoviridis. of these,  <dig> were previously known from the literature, although this figure includes isomeric forms not previously reported. fifty-one sequences were similar to those reported from other venomous snake taxa, but were new for protobothrops. an additional  <dig> have not previously been reported for any snake. in regard to ovophis okinavensis,  <dig> of the  <dig> cdna sequences reported herein are new for this species, and  <dig> have not been reported previously for any snake. peptides were sequenced from 100% of transcripts that were more abundant than contaminants such as human keratin . peptides were also sequenced from at least  <dig> additional transcripts that occurred below the contaminant level.

to the best of our knowledge this study also furnishes the first peptidyl sequence data  for venom phospholipase b and 5’-nucleotidase, and the first mrna sequence data for a snake acid pme, adenylosuccinate synthase, paraoxonase, and a putative tissue factor pathway inhibitor. novel crotasin/growth-arresting peptide/crotamine-like sequences are reported from the ovophis transcriptome. the protobothrops 3ftx sequence is only the third such sequence reported from a crotalid, but it differs in significant ways from the other two sequences.

dominated by pla <dig>  mps, and lao, adult protobothrops venom strategically promotes hemorrhage, hypotension, incoagulable blood, and prey digestion, consistent with mammalian predation. ovophis venom, by contrast, is composed principally of sps and mps  . its composition is less readily interpreted, owing to inadequate pharmacological data for venom proteases. this venom apparently represents a hybrid strategy optimized for frogs and small mammals, but the contributions of most components cannot be unambiguously assessed at present.
