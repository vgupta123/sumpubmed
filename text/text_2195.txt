BACKGROUND
enterococci are gram-positive commensals of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other mammals. currently, more than  <dig> species in the genus enterococcus have been described  <cit> . the two most studied enterococcal species are e. faecium and e. faecalis, which are genetically distinct as shown by their 16s rrna sequences and the sequences of the housekeeping gene atpa  <cit> . both e. faecium and e. faecalis are an important cause of infections in hospitalized, immunocompromized patients  <cit> . historically, e. faecalis has caused 90% of all enterococcal infections, but since the late 1980s a rapid increase in nosocomial e. faecium infections has occurred  <cit> . this expansion of e. faecium in the hospital environment coincided with the swift acquisition of multiple resistance mechanisms against many antibiotics. resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin are probably the most significant resistance traits that have been acquired by e. faecium since the 1980s and nowadays the majority of e. faecium clinical isolates are resistant to these antibiotics. in contrast with e. faecium, resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin in e. faecalis is still a relatively rare trait  <cit> . treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant e. faecium is currently a clinical challenge and the few remaining therapeutic options are jeopardized by the emergence of resistance to new classes of antibiotics  <cit> . therefore antibiotic-resistant e. faecium, together with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, is currently seen as one of the gravest threats to successful therapy presented by gram-positive bacteria  <cit> .

several studies have shown that the e. faecium strains that cause infections in hospitalized patients are different from the strains that colonize the gastro-intestinal tract of the healthy human host  <cit> . population biology-based studies using multilocus sequence typing  suggested that the large majority of strains isolated from nosocomial infections belong to a distinct genetic lineage termed clonal complex  <dig>   <cit> . in a previous study, in which comparative genome hybridization was used to assay diversity in e. faecium, more than  <dig> genes were found to be enriched in e. faecium cc <dig> isolates. insertion sequence  elements were the most prominent group of genes enriched in cc <dig> but, in addition, genes with a proven or proposed role in e. faecium virulence were also specifically identified in cc <dig> isolates  <cit> .

only two genes in e. faecium have been experimentally verified to contribute to virulence in animal models. these are the large surface protein esp, which has a role in biofilm formation and urinary tract infection  <cit>  and the mscramm  acm, which is an adhesin of collagen and contributes to endocarditis  <cit> . the hyl gene, which was proposed to encode a protein functioning as a hyaluronidase, is primarily found in clinical isolates and is much less common in e. faecium strains from other sources  <cit> . although a hyl deletion mutant has not been described, the conjugative transfer of a plasmid containing the hyl gene made the transconjugant more virulent in a mouse peritonitis model, suggesting a role for the hyl gene in virulence  <cit> . in addition, binding to extra-cellular matrix components of a number of other surface proteins has also been shown experimentally and these proteins may contribute to virulence of e. faecium by acting as adhesins  <cit> . however, animal experiments of deletion mutants in the genes encoding these proteins need to be performed to further characterize the role  of these proteins in e. faecium pathogenesis. the acquisition of genes conferring an infectious phenotype to e. faecium is thought to be a recent phenomenon, and coincides with the global emergence of e. faecium as a nosocomial pathogen since the late 1980s  <cit> .

molecular studies into the biology of e. faecium have so far been hampered by the poor genetic accessibility of this organism. additionally, there has long been a marked lack of genome sequence information for e. faecium and consequently there exists a need for a multi-strain genomic analysis of e. faecium with the aim to describe its fundamental biology and to determine the causes of its emergence as a nosocomial pathogen.

in recent years, alternatives to sanger-based genome shot-gun sequencing have been developed. these 'next-generation' sequencing technologies are characterized by dramatically higher throughputs and lower costs for sequencing than sanger-based sequencing methodologies. pyrosequencing, which is also known as  <dig> sequencing in reference to the company  <dig> life sciences  that markets pyrosequencing platforms, currently appears to be the most widely used next-generation sequencing method for de novo microbial genome sequencing  <cit> . while next-generation genome sequencing methods can be used to rapidly sequence a genome to completion in cases when no or very few repetitive elements are present  <cit> , a more typical outcome is a draft genome assembly consisting of relatively large contigs which essentially cover the entire genome, but where gaps are caused by repetitive elements that are allocated to, generally small, separate contigs  <cit> . pyrosequencing-based genome analyses of several micro-organisms of medical importance have recently been performed and have demonstrated the contribution of genomic islands for the development of pathogenicity and the large genetic diversity that can be contained within a single bacterial species  <cit> .

in this study we use pyrosequencing-based genome sequencing of seven e. faecium strains to quantify the genomic diversity and determine core- and pan-genome size and to identify genomic differences between e. faecium and e. faecalis. the genome analysis of e. faecium also led to the identification of a large pathogenicity island that is associated with the esp gene. this study will provide a starting point for genome-wide studies to develop targeted strategies against this emerging nosocomial pathogen.

RESULTS
genome sequencing of seven e. faecium isolates
four of the sequenced strains  originated from human infections and consequently are referred to collectively as infectious isolates in this study. strains e <dig> and e <dig> were isolated from the faeces of healthy human volunteers. strain e <dig> was isolated as part of a hospital surveillance program in a dutch hospital. this surveillance program was instigated because of an ongoing outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the hospitalized patients. e <dig> was isolated from a patient not suffering from an enterococcal infection and subsequent typing of the isolate showed that it was different from the strain causing the outbreak.

prior to genome sequencing, mlst was used to determine the sequence type  of the selected isolates. mlst is currently widely used for population studies of e. faecium and is based on dna sequence analysis of seven housekeeping genes  <cit> . mlst of the seven selected isolates showed that they all had different sts and represented a sufficiently diverse sample of the species e. faecium. two of the sequenced strains  were assigned to cc <dig>  the sequenced strains were chosen to cover a large period of time, with the most ancient strain being from the year  <dig>  and the most recent from  <dig> . the relevant characteristics of the sequenced isolates are summarized in table  <dig> 

a country abbreviations. nld: the netherlands; fra: france; bra: brazil.

the genomes of the seven selected e. faecium strains were sequenced using pyrosequencing technology  <cit>  on the gs-flx platform. the e. faecium genome sequence data obtained in this project are summarized in table  <dig>  lander-waterman statistics  <cit>  estimate that more than  <dig> % of each genome was sequenced. the genome sequences revealed roughly identical %g+c content, average gene size and %protein coding dna for all strains. the quality of the generated sequences was evaluated using the phred-like quality scores that are linked to these reads. only between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of bases had quality scores lower than  <dig>  which represents a small chance  for a mis-called base  <cit> . thus, we conclude that these draft genome sequences are of good quality and can be used for further analyses. there is considerable variation in the number of assembled bases between the seven genomes, suggesting large differences in the size of the chromosome between strains and/or the variable presence of large plasmids. to determine the presence of large plasmids in the seven isolates of which the genome was sequenced we performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  with s <dig> nuclease digestion of whole genomic dna . this revealed that in all isolates plasmids with sizes > <dig> kb are present. four of the sequenced strains  have mega-plasmids that range in size between  <dig> and  <dig> kb. the variable presence of large plasmids between the isolates is therefore an important cause of the variation in number of assembled bases that was observed in these genome projects.

functional categorization by cog  classification of the predicted proteome of the sequenced strains  revealed a largely identical functional repertoire in the seven sequenced strains with the largest variance between strains in the percentage of proteins assigned to cog functional category l .

identification of antibiotic resistance determinants in the sequenced isolates
we determined antibiotic resistance profiles of the sequenced isolates by broth microdilution and linked the observed resistances to the presence of resistance genes . these data show that strains that have been isolated recently from hospitals  are multi-resistant, while the human commensal strains e <dig> and e <dig> have not acquired broad resistance to antibiotics. practically all observed antibiotic resistant phenotypes could be linked to the presence of one or more different antibiotic resistance genes, most of which appear to reside on plasmids as can be concluded from the presence of plasmid replication or toxin/anti-toxin genes for plasmid maintenance on the same contigs as the antibiotic resistance genes. two strains  were found to be resistant to vancomycin. both these strains carry the vana transposon. in strain e <dig> the vana transposon is of the a <dig> type  <cit> , in which a copy of an is1216v-is <dig> like element has inserted at the left end of the vana transposon, which results in the deletion of the first  <dig> bp as compared to the archetypal tn <dig> vancomycin resistance element described by arthur et al.  <cit> . in addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism  was identified in the vanx gene at position  <dig>  of the vana transposon, resulting in the substitution of a lysine to an asparagine in vanx. in strain e <dig> the vana transposon is essentially identical to the tn <dig> element  <cit>  with only a single snp  occuring at position  <dig> resulting in the substitution of an alanine by a threonine in the vans protein.

in addition, strains e <dig>  e <dig> and u <dig> are high-level resistant  > <dig> μg/ml) to ampicillin and have point mutations that are known to confer resistance to this antibiotic  <cit>  in the pbp <dig> gene. strain e <dig>  which is low-level resistant to ampicillin , does not have these mutations. presumably, other mechanisms, such as an elevated expression of pbp <dig>  <cit>  could play a role here. the two strains  that are resistant to ciprofloxacin both carry point mutations in the gyra and parc genes, which have previously been described to be associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin  <cit> .

on the basis of mlst, the multi-drug resistant strain e <dig> groups with isolates from piggeries and healthy humans in a clonal complex that is generally not linked to human infections  <cit> . genome analysis of e <dig> suggests a possible pig origin of this strain on the basis of two observations. firstly, e <dig> was found to contain the tcr gene cluster, which confers resistance to copper  <cit> . another putative copper detoxification system  was also identified in e <dig>  this finding suggests a porcine origin of e <dig> as resistance to copper in e. faecium is selected for in pigs because this metal is used as a growth-promoting feed supplement  <cit> . secondly, the base pair found at position  <dig> of the vana transposon also suggests a porcine origin of e <dig>  the observed nucleotide t at position  <dig> is associated with porcine isolates while a g at this position would indicate a strain originating from poultry  <cit> . strain e <dig> may therefore be representative of e. faecium strains that can be easily transferred between pigs and humans and may therefore shuttle antibiotic resistance genes between these niches.

cog-based functional comparison between e. faecium and e. faecalis
a more detailed cog-based functional comparison between e. faecium and e. faecalis was performed to identify characteristics that distinguish these two species. a total of  <dig> cogs  were present in all of the e. faecium genomes sequenced in this study, while being absent in six publicly available e. faecalis genome sequences. the reverse analysis, in which cogs were identified that are present in all e. faecalis genomes and absent from e. faecium, showed that  <dig> cogs are specific for e. faecalis .

the cog-based comparison of e. faecium and e. faecalis revealed important differences between both organisms in sugar metabolism, particularly of the pentose sugar arabinose. the ability to use arabinose by e. faecium can be used to distinguish e. faecium from e. faecalis  <cit>  but further characterization of the metabolism of this sugar in e. faecium has not been performed. in other lactic acid bacteria  <cit> , the isomerization of arabinose to ribulose is the first step in the metabolism of this sugar. this reaction is predicted to be catalyzed by the e. faecium protein belonging to cog <dig>  which is not present in e. faecalis. subsequently ribulose can be phosphorylated, after which the resulting intermediate ribulose-5-phosphate is further metabolized through the phosphoketolase pathway in which phosphoketolase  is responsible for the crucial conversion of xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  and acetyl-phosphate  <cit> . gap is then further used as a substrate in the embden-meyerhof pathway. in e. faecalis proteins belonging to both cog <dig> and cog <dig> are absent and this probably explains the inability of e. faecalis to ferment arabinose. e. faecium also has cogs dedicated to the uptake of arabinose  and the degradation of arabinose-containing oligo-saccharides , all of which are absent from e. faecalis.

the presence of cogs in e. faecium that are specifically involved in the metabolism of arabinose suggests that e. faecium has adapted its metabolism to include plant polysaccharides or their degradation products as energy sources since arabinose occurs abundantly in nature as subunits of hemicellulose. the ability of e. faecium to utilize carbon sources from plant origin is also exemplified by the presence in all e. faecium strains of proteins belonging to cog <dig>  which is predicted to be involved in the metabolism of pectin or its degradation products, and to cog <dig>  which is likely to be involved in the breakdown of coumaric acid and other components of lignocellulose as has been shown for a similar protein  in lactobacillus plantarum  <cit> . again, none of these cogs are present in e. faecalis. in contrast, a number of cogs that are unique to e. faecalis are linked to its previously described ability to use ethanolamine as a carbon source during anaerobic growth in the presence of cobalamin  <cit> . ethanolamine is a common head group of phospholipids and is therefore abundantly present in the gut as part of the host's diet.

another metabolic difference between e. faecium and e. faecalis was predicted in the first step of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, i.e. the conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenolpyruvate . in e. faecium, pyruvate can be converted by pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate and subsequently pep is formed from oxaloacetate by the action of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase . in e. faecalis, the latter enzyme is not present and pep is formed directly from pyruvate by the enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase .

the cog-based comparison of e. faecium and e. faecalis also revealed differences in proteins involved in the protection against oxidative stress. in contrast to e. faecalis  <cit> , e. faecium does not have the enzyme catalase, but it has other mechanisms putatively targeted at oxygen detoxification. one of these mechanisms is a peroxiredoxin and a corresponding reductase . while e. faecalis also has proteins with a similar function , the e. faecium proteins are not orthologous to these e. faecalis proteins, but instead are related to a similar and biochemically characterized system in thermus aquaticus with 81% and 61% amino acid identity for the peroxiredoxin and its reductase, respectively  <cit> . another possible defense mechanism to oxidative stress is provided by glutathione , which can be synthesized by both e. faecium and e. faecalis  <cit> . the reduced form of glutathione, together with the enzyme gluthatione peroxidase, can detoxify reactive oxygen species, resulting in the formation of gssg  <cit> . e. faecium has a glutathione peroxidase , but e. faecalis does not have this particular enzyme, suggesting that in e. faecium glutathione may play a more prominent role in the oxidative stress response than in e. faecalis. in contrast to e. faecium, e. faecalis is capable to respire aerobically in the presence of heme due to a cytochrome bd-type respiratory oxidase , which leads to the production of substantial amounts of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . this particular selective pressure may have led to divergent evolution of the oxidative stress response in e. faecium and e. faecalis.

phylogenomic and diversity analysis of the e. faecium genome
phylogenomic trees for the seven e. faecium isolates were constructed based on concatenated alignments of  <dig> orthologous proteins in the genomes  and based on the overall gene content of the genomes . fig. 1a is a maximum likelihood tree based on mutations in conserved proteins among the seven sequenced isolates and is therefore indicative of the evolutionary distance between the sequenced strains. fig. 1b is a neighbor joining tree with shared gene content as distance measure  and represents the differences between the strains caused by gene gain and loss. both analyses resulted in phylogenomic trees of nearly congruent topology and demonstrate that strain e <dig> is evolutionary distinct from the other six sequenced isolates, which are more closely related to each other. while the evolutionary distance between these six isolates  is relatively small, there are considerable differences in gene content between strains. this observation indicates that gene gain and loss, rather than evolutionary descent, appears to be the most important driving force in determining fitness of a given e. faecium strain in a specific environment. there is no evidence for a recent common ancestor of strains which have been isolated from an infection . however, the two strains from cc <dig>  appear to share a more recent common evolutionary history compared to the other isolates. while e <dig> and u <dig> appear to be relatively closely related to each other based on the alignment of orthologous proteins, there is a remarkably large difference  in gene content between these two strains.

to further quantify the intra-species diversity of e. faecium, the coding sequences  predicted from the seven genomes were compared by a highly sensitive all-vs-all sequence alignment. subsequently, the new gene discovery rate was estimated by fitting a least squares power law  = κnew n-α) to the median number of new genes calculated for all strain combinations . the value for the exponent αdetermines whether the pan-genome can be considered to be essentially unlimited in size  or to have a finite size   <cit> . in the case of e. faecium, the estimated value for α is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  signifying an open pan-genome and a high genomic diversity between e. faecium strains. to estimate the total size of the gene pool available to e. faecium , an analysis was performed using the same all-vs-all sequence alignment in which both genes that were shared and genes that are strain specific were counted. a least squares power law  = κpan nγ) was fit to the medians and the resulting γ value of  <dig> , being >  <dig>  is again indicative of an open pan-genome  <cit>  and confirms that new e. faecium genes will continue to be identified as more genomes are sequenced.

the size of the core genome was estimated by fitting an exponential curve to the median number of cds conserved across all the genomes calculated for all strain combinations . the core genome size of e. faecium was estimated to be  <dig> ±  <dig> cds. this value shows that a sizeable fraction of the e. faecium genome is accessory. in e <dig>  which has the smallest genome in our data set, 16% of the genome is non-core, while this quantity increases to 29% in u <dig> 

bacteriophages in e. faecium
analysis of the accessory genome of the e. faecium strains revealed that phage and phage-like sequences contribute significantly to the genomic diversity in e. faecium . cds of predicted phage origins make up between  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total number of cds of the genome. in all isolates a significant fraction of these cds are strain-specific, indicating the unique nature of the phage elements that are present in each genome. no cds of phage origin were found to be specifically associated with infectious isolates. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  consist of short, conserved repeats interspaced by variable sequences and provide immunity against foreign genetic elements. crisprs have been identified in approximately 40% of sequenced eubacterial genomes and are associated with cas genes that are essential for the antiviral function of crisprs  <cit> . in three of the sequenced strains  crispr-loci could be identified but in all strains the crispr locus is located inside a gene. the protein that is encoded by this gene is homologous to plasmid replication initiator proteins in other lactic acid bacteria. it seems unlikely that the gene's internal repeat sequences act as genuine crisprs. in addition, none of the sequenced e. faecium strains contain a homolog of the cas <dig> gene , which is a universal marker for crispr-associated genes  <cit> . thus, there is no evidence to suggest that a functional crispr-cas system is present in the sequenced e. faecium strains and this may explain their diversity in prophage sequences. the fully sequenced e. faecalis v <dig> strain also does not contain the crispr-cas system and its genome contains a number of prophage elements. these findings are in contrast to e. faecalis strain og1rf  <cit> , which has a crispr-locus and associated cas genes. interestingly, the e. faecalis og1rf genome does not contain prophage sequences  <cit> .

a values in brackets denote the percentage of cds relative to the total number of cds in the genome. a cds was scored as unique for a specific genome when the encoded protein did not have a blast-hit with 90% amino acid identity or higher in any of the other sequenced isolates.

in five of the seven sequenced e. faecium strains phages could be activated by mitomycin through observation of phage particles by transmission electron microscopy of the culture supernatant . all these phages had an isometric head with a long non-contractile segmented tail, which is characteristic of the siphoviridae. siphoviridae are a very common family of bacteriophages of the lactic acid bacteria  <cit> . while head-sizes are similar , there is marked variation in the size of the tails, ranging from ~ <dig> nm in the e <dig> phage to ~ <dig> nm in the e <dig> phage.

phage lysates were tested for their infectivity but plaque formation was not observed . this may be explained by a defect in infectivity of the phage particles, but it may also be possible that the prophages that are integrated into the different genomes protect the host against extra phage infection  <cit> .

identification of potential and established virulence genes
to identify other genes potentially involved in virulence or the emergence of e. faecium as a nosocomial pathogen, the proteomes predicted to be encoded by the genomes of the strains that were isolated from human infections  were compared to the predicted proteomes of the non-infectious isolates . this revealed that a group of  <dig> orthologous proteins are conserved in all infectious strains, while being absent in the non-infectious strains . to estimate the relevance of this particular number of shared proteins, we performed a similar analysis to identify proteins shared between all possible four combinations of genomes, while being absent in the remaining three genomes. this analysis showed that the average number of shared proteins in a combination of four strains, while being absent in the three other strains is  <dig> , with a median value of  <dig>  the  <dig> shared proteins between infectious strains and absent from non-infectious strains represent the highest value for all possible combinations. seven of the  <dig> proteins that occur solely in infectious isolates are is elements of different families. these may contribute to the genomic flexibility in e. faecium and thereby facilitate the sequential acquisition of adaptive elements. in addition, an abc transporter with unknown substrate specificity is also found to be specific for infectious isolates. other proteins that are conserved in all infectious isolates have predicted roles in plasmid replication or have a putative function as phage type integrases/recombinases. finally, a number of hypothetical proteins are only present in infectious isolates, two of which are predicted to be located in the cytoplasmic membrane.

the presence of the known virulence genes esp, hyl and acm in the sequenced isolates was also analyzed. the esp gene was found in strains e <dig>  e <dig> and u <dig>  the hyl gene is only present in u <dig>  a full-length acm gene is present in e <dig> and u <dig>  in other strains this gene is either inactivated by insertion of a transposon  or by mutations that introduce a premature stop-codon . this finding is in line with previous research, which has shown that interrupted acm genes are common in strains not belonging to cc <dig> and that an intact acm gene may have contributed to the recent emergence of cc <dig> as a nosocomial pathogen  <cit> .

identification and mobilization of an e. faecium pathogenicity island
three sequenced strains  harbor the esp gene, which encodes an approximately  <dig> kda protein that is anchored to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall through the presence of an lpxtg-type motif. in e. faecium, esp is involved in biofilm formation and urinary tract infection in a mouse model  <cit> . in a previous study, the esp gene was proposed to be carried on a pathogenicity island , but only  <dig> kb of the pai was sequenced in a single strain and the integration site of the pai was not resolved  <cit> . by using the genome sequences of the esp+ strains and after additional sequencing of pcr products that were generated to span gaps between contigs, we were able to complete the sequence of the esp containing pai for all three strains. this revealed that esp is carried on a large pai in e. faecium that is considerably larger than the  <dig> kb of sequence that was previously obtained  <cit>  as it varies in size between  <dig> kb ,  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb  . there is some variation in the %g+c-content of the esp pai . this is  <dig>  to  <dig> % lower than the average %g+c-content over the entire genome of these strains, indicating that the dna of the esp pai is acquired exogenously. in e <dig> and e <dig> the esp pai is flanked by an imperfect 54-bp direct repeat , with the left repeat being the 3' end of the rpsi gene  and the right repeat just upstream of a small gene encoding a  <dig> kda protein with unknown function. in u <dig> the 3' end of the pai is inserted at the same genomic location as in the other strains and is flanked by the repeat sequence, but the 5' end has integrated downstream of the tuf gene. the rpsi gene is present in this strain, but only a small element, which is identical to the 5' part of the e <dig> esp pai, is found downstream. this suggests that the complete esp pai in u <dig> has originally inserted downstream of rpsi, but that since then a genomic rearrangement event has occurred, which finally resulted in nearly the complete esp pai reintegrating downstream of tuf.

the sequence of large parts of the esp pai is conserved between the three strains and diversity within the esp pai is mainly caused by the variable presence of genetic elements. the most striking insertion in the esp pai has occurred in e <dig> and consists of a 7-kb gene cluster near the 5' end of the pai, which encodes a complete pathway for inositol metabolism. of the seven sequenced isolates, only e <dig> is capable of using inositol as a carbon source , suggesting that the metabolic pathway encoded by this element is functional. in all strains, a 10-kb element is present in the 5' part of the pai that is essentially completely identical  to a gene cluster  in the 154-kb pathogenicity island of e. faecalis mmh <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, this e. faecalis pai also carries the esp gene. the presence of these regions of identical dna in both e. faecium and e. faecalis pais suggests a recent transfer of genetic material between these two species or acquisition from a third source. the function of this gene cluster in both e. faecium and e. faecalis is unclear. three cds of the element are predicted to encode ribosomal proteins and among the other encoded proteins are a membrane protein putatively functioning as a multi-drug transporter and membrane proteins that appear to be involved in the uptake of manganese. interestingly, manganese uptake systems have been linked to virulence in various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . another gene which can play a role in host-cell interactions is found on the extreme 3' end of the esp pai. this gene encodes a  <dig> kda lpxtg-type cell wall anchored protein that is 91% identical to the ecba protein from e. faecium do, which was shown to acts as an adhesin to the extracellular matrix components fibrinogen and collagen  <cit> . the 3' end of all three esp pais is closely related  to an element termed efab <dig>  <cit>  in e. faecalis . in its turn, the efab <dig> element is closely related to the conjugation module of tn <dig> 

previously, the esp gene was shown to be transferable by conjugation between two e. faecium isolates  <cit>  but no further analysis of the transfer of the esp gene was performed in this study. our observation that esp is located on a pai led us to reinvestigate the mobilization of esp, to assess if the esp pai is completely or partially transferred and if the esp pai inserts in a site-specific manner. we performed filter mating experiments with e. faecium e1162Δesp  as donor strain and bm4105rf as recipient. transconjugants were picked up with a frequency of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per recipient cell. insertion of the pai in the recipient strains was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   with subsequent southern blotting with a probe for the non-deleted part of esp . this showed that a single fragment in the transconjugant had increased ~ <dig> kb in size and hybridized with the esp probe, which corresponds to transfer of the complete esp pai of e <dig>  to determine the insertion site of the esp pai in the transconjugants, we also probed the blot with a pcr fragment covering the putative integration site and found an identical ~ <dig> kb increase in size of the hybridizing band, showing that the esp pai has inserted at the same chromosomal location  as in e <dig>  these data were also confirmed by performing pcrs with primers that annealed to the flanking regions of the esp pai and the 5' and 3' ends of the esp pai  and subsequent sequencing of the pcr products . our data show that the complete pai can be transferred from an esp pai carrying strain to an esp- strain and inserts in a site-specific manner directly downstream of the rpsi gene. moreover, due to the use of an esp deletion mutant as donor in the conjugation experiment, we can conclude that the esp protein is not essential for this process.

remarkably, in the strains e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  which do not harbor the esp pai, other elements have inserted in the same locus, suggesting that this is an important hot-spot for integration and recombination in e. faecium. these elements are considerably smaller than the esp pai. in e <dig>  a 9-kb element encodes a phosphotransferase  system and a glycoside hydrolase . in e <dig> a deletion of  <dig> genes that form the right flanking region of the esp pai has occurred. in both e <dig> and e <dig>  different elements  have inserted into the putative hot spot. they encode no obvious functions, but the presence of two distinct repa-like genes indicates that these elements are integrated plasmids. in both e <dig> and e <dig> the inserted elements are flanked by the 54-bp direct repeat .

discussion
in the last two decades e. faecium has emerged as a nosocomial pathogen in severely immunocompromized patients. successful treatment is increasingly hampered by antibiotic resistance, and consequently, e. faecium infections are associated with considerable morbidity and high mortality  <cit> . to obtain a better understanding of the basic biology of e. faecium and to estimate the diversity contained within this species we sequenced the genomes of seven e. faecium strains that were isolated from different ecological niches. this is the first study which employs genome sequencing for the study of this important nosocomial pathogen.

resistance to several antibiotics was observed in all sequenced isolates and these phenotypically observed resistances could generally be linked to the presence of previously described resistance determinants in the isolates. isolates from clinical sites were particularly rich in antibiotic resistance genes. the association of the antibiotic resistance genes with mobile genetic elements that we observed in the seven isolates under study here is in line with previous studies  <cit>  and suggests that e. faecium may serve as an important hub for the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to other intestinal bacteria  <cit> .

a comparison between e. faecium and e. faecalis revealed differences in the occurence of several protein families between the two organisms. in particular, e. faecium has several metabolic pathways dedicated to the metabolism of carbohydrates of plant origin, which are absent from e. faecalis. this suggests an evolutionary adaptation to a lifestyle as a gut symbiont of herbivorous or omnivorous animals and may also enable e. faecium to survive on plant surfaces from which it can frequently be isolated  <cit> . the proteins tentatively involved in the protection against oxidative stress in e. faecium are very different from those in e. faecalis. the oxidative stress response of e. faecalis has been characterized in considerable detail and appears to be linked to virulence  <cit> . interestingly, exogenous production of hydrogen peroxide by e. faecium has been identified as an important virulence factor in a caenorhabditis elegans model of infection  <cit> . understanding how e. faecium can protect itself from the reactive oxygen species that it produces itself or to which it is exposed to in neutrophils or macrophages during infection, may provide important insights into the process by which e. faecium can cause disease.

this study also provides novel insights into the population structure of e. faecium, which has so far been defined by mlst. upon analysis of the mlst data using the algorithm eburst, it has been suggested that the large majority of strains isolated from nosocomial infections group in a distinct cluster, termed cc <dig>  <cit> . however, the use of mlst in combination with the eburst-algorithm to describe the population structure of e. faecium has been disputed as high recombination rates in e. faecium, in combination with a relatively low mutation rate, results in unreliable phylogenetic inferences by eburst  <cit> . recently, an analysis of the mlst database for e. faecium using novel and more advanced algorithms than eburst has suggested that the sts constituting cc <dig> have in fact evolved independently from different ancestral clones  <cit> . the phylogenomic analysis presented here  provides a detailed insight into the evolutionary descent of the seven sequenced strains and can be used to further refine our understanding of the evolution of e. faecium. in this study, two of the seven sequenced isolates  have been assigned to cc <dig> on the basis of mlst. our genomic data, combined with the recent insights obtained by mlst, suggest that the cc <dig> isolates appear to have formed a sub-population in the e. faecium species. however, it is also clear that these infectious isolates are not strictly clonally related to each other and have diversified considerably. in addition, the large differences in gene content observed here show that even in strains that are relatively closely related on the level of their core genome, the gain and/or loss of mobile genetic elements is the leading force in determining strain-specific properties.

the pan-genome analysis of e. faecium indicated that the total available gene pool within this species is essentially unlimited. this may be explained by its ability to incorporate foreign dna into its gene pool and by the wide variety of ecological niches, such as the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and foods, that e. faecium can colonize. this allows the organism to come into contact with many pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria and sets the scene for extensive horizontal gene transfer between e. faecium and others. a consequence of the open pan-genome of e. faecium is that it can rapidly acquire genes that have the potential to increase fitness under adverse environmental conditions. this is most obvious in the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes in clinical isolates . in addition, genes that allow for infection of the immunocompromized host may also be acquired and introduced into the e. faecium gene pool, as is exemplified by the esp pai.

lysogenic bacteriophages have so far not been studied in e. faecium, but they make an important contribution to the genomic diversity of e. faecium. it has been hypothesized that lysogenic bacteriophages should confer some advantage to the host, because otherwise they would be lost due to competition with non-infected strains. they may also increase the environmental fitness of the lysogenic host in a process termed lysogenic conversion, which has been described to add to the virulence of several gram-positive pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes and s. aureus  <cit> . it remains to be determined to what extent bacteriophages contribute to niche adaptation and an infectious phenotype in e. faecium, but the wide variety of phages that has been identified in this relatively small sample of strains show that they have a major role in shaping the genome of e. faecium. the absence of a functional crispr-cas system in the sequenced e. faecium isolates may make these strains relatively susceptible to phage attack, resulting in a high diversity of integrated prophages. the crispr-cas system has also been implicated in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes among staphylococci  <cit> . it is currently unknown if the crispr-cas system also acts as a barrier to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in enterococci.

the esp gene of e. faecium is more abundant in clinical isolates than in isolates from food or environmental origins  <cit>  and contributes to biofilm formation and urinary tract infections in an animal model  <cit> . here we show that esp is carried on a large pathogenicity island. also in e. faecalis, the esp gene is harbored on a large pathogenicity island of approximately  <dig> kb in size. this e. faecalis pai also carries the genes needed for the production of cytolysin, an exotoxin that contributes to e. faecalis virulence  <cit> . in e. faecium we have not observed a homolog of the e. faecalis cytolysin and in fact most other genes of the e. faecalis pathogenicity island as described in strain mmh <dig>  <cit>  are absent in the e. faecium esp pai. the exceptions to this rule are the esp gene itself and the 10-kb gene cluster described above, which is completely conserved between the esp pais of e. faecium and e. faecalis. the presence of this conserved element suggests recent horizontal transfer of these genes between e. faecium and e. faecalis or, possibly, the independent acquisition of this element by e. faecium and e. faecalis from another common source. horizontal transfer may also explain the presence of the efab <dig> element on the 3' end of the esp pai in e. faecium. this element is part of a larger family of conjugative and integrative elements in many gram-positive bacteria. exchange of specific modules in these elements appears to be a relatively common event. the esp pai may, therefore, be the result of the serendipitous accumulation of several genetic elements in the hot spot provided by the rpsi gene in the e. faecium genome. interestingly, also in streptococcus agalactiae several mobile genetic elements have been found to be integrated downstream of rpsi  <cit> , suggesting that this gene forms a hot spot for genomic diversity in different gram-positive bacteria.

even though the overall architecture of the esp pai is identical in all sequenced isolates, there are also marked differences between the esp pais in the three different isolates described in this manuscript. these are mainly caused by the independent acquisition of other elements, such as the putative inositol metabolic pathway in strain e <dig>  this shows that recombination in the esp pai is an ongoing process. because the esp pai is mobilizable, as demonstrated here by the conjugative transfer of the pai between the strains e1162Δesp and bm4105rf, the esp gene and the other genes that are carried on the pathogenicity island may spread rapidly through e. faecium, thereby contributing to the ability to infect immunocompromized human hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have performed the first genome-based study of the nosocomial pathogen e. faecium. we found that the isolates originating from the hospital have acquired multiple antibiotic resistance genes and, in addition, have genes that may play a role in the colonization and infection of hospitalized patients. genome sequencing of multiple isolates allowed us to determine a genome-based phylogeny of e. faecium and to accurately quantify the substantial genomic diversity between strains in this species. this analysis showed that the two strains belonging to cc <dig> in our data-set were relatively closely related on the basis of their core genome but still have a large difference in gene content, suggesting that gain and loss of mobile genetic elements, rather than evolutionary descent, is the most important driving force in determining virulence-associated properties in this clonal complex. the variable presence of lysogenic bacteriophages in the sequenced strains was found to be an important contributor to the intra-species diversity of e. faecium. we also identified characteristics that distinguish e. faecium from the related nosocomial pathogen e. faecalis, particularly in the repertoire of genes involved in sugar metabolism and the response to oxidative stress. finally we show that three isolates have acquired a large pai that is associated with the esp gene and we provide evidence that horizontal gene transfer between e. faecium and e. faecalis may have occurred during the evolution of this pai.

while e. faecium currently has a lower virulence potential than other cocci with a low-%g+c content, such as s. aureus and pathogenic streptococci, its resistance to antibiotics has made it one of the most difficult-to-treat nosocomial pathogens. the genomic flexibility of e. faecium allows the efficient integration of additional fitness determinants to the e. faecium gene pool, leading to the rapid adaptation to new environmental niches such as those that are found in hospitalized patients. genome-wide studies, which will be facilitated by the sequence data presented here, are therefore needed to increase our understanding of the basic biology of e. faecium and to identify genes that are essential for colonization and infection of hospitalized patients.
