BACKGROUND
lyme disease is caused by infection with the tick-transmitted spirochete, borrelia burgdorferi. it is currently the most common vector-borne disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring in parts of north america, europe and asia  <cit> . persistent host infection by b. burgdorferi has been linked to the presence of the  <dig> kilobase linear plasmid, lp28- <dig>  which harbors  <dig> open reading frames that are designated bbf <dig> to bbf <dig> . clones lacking lp28- <dig> exhibit an intermediate infectivity phenotype, whereby these spirochetes are able to disseminate to tissue sites but are unable to persist in the murine host . notably, these same clones are capable of long-term survival in severe-combined immunodeficient  mice that lack an effective antibody response  <cit> . studies involving telomere-mediated deletion of a 10 kb region  containing the vmp-like sequence  locus responsible for antigenic variation of a vls-expressed  lipoprotein found that these mutant spirochetes are cleared in immunocompetent mice by day  <dig> post infection, matching the phenotype observed with the complete loss of lp28- <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic of the open reading frames of the b. burgdorferi lp28- <dig> plasmid. genes are flanked by telomeres . double-headed solid arrows show regions that have been previously deleted: a  <cit> , b and c  <cit> . genetic loci bbf19- <dig> or bbf27- <dig> were chosen for mutational analysis, as there is no knowledge for their respective roles in b. burgdorferi persistence. conserved regions ; pseudogenes ; short genes less than 300 bp ; autonomous replication genes 



although numerous studies have been conducted on the importance of the vls locus, it has not been fully determined whether other genes on lp28- <dig> play a role in infectivity and persistence. mutation or deletion of the bbf <dig> gene that encodes for the arthritis related protein, arp, was shown to exhibit a reduced ability to cause joint inflammation, but did not alter infectivity or persistence in immunocompetent mice  <cit> . clones containing a deletion of bbf <dig> to bbf <dig> were found to be fully infectious and persistent following infection in immunocompetent mice  <cit> . however, signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis of lp28- <dig>  <cit>  identified several genes within the bbf1- <dig> region  as having a possible impact on infectivity. region bbf23-bbf <dig> of lp28- <dig> codes for the paralogous family proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these genes are known to be required for autonomous replication of the lp28- <dig> plasmid  <cit> , and have been shown to be required for infectivity  <cit> . in addition to previous mutational studies, work by embers et al. found that regulation of outer surface protein c  is impaired in spirochetes lacking lp28- <dig>  which could also potentially contribute to the lack of persistence exhibited by this strain  <cit> . this disregulation resulted in continued expression of ospc, which has been shown to lead to spirochete clearance by an adaptive host immune response .

to date, with the exception of bbf <dig>  <cit> , two regions containing the orfs bbf <dig> - bbf <dig> and bbf <dig> – bbf <dig> have not been mutated in their entirety. hence, the question addressed in this study is whether loss of the genes within these two regions has an effect on infectivity and persistence by b. burgdorferi. the bbf19- <dig> region encodes one pseudogene , a conserved hypothetical protein , a short gene  and a putative p <dig> protein . region bbf27- <dig> encodes mostly short genes  and one pseudogene   <cit> . to further investigate the role of non-vls genes of lp28- <dig> in disease persistence and potentially the regulation of ospc expression, mutants were generated that lacked either region bbf1- <dig>  bbf19- <dig> or bbf27- <dig>  and their respective impact on infectivity and disease persistence was assessed in immunocompetent c3h mice. results provided here show no significant difference in infectivity and persistence between wild type b. burgdorferi and the generated mutants. in addition, the particular lp28- <dig> regions under study may not be involved in ospc downregulation as a mechanism of immune avoidance, as there was no significant difference in ospc expression levels during host infection between the wild-type and mutant clones.

methods
b. burgdorferi clones and culture methods
borrelia burgdorferi b31-a <dig>  was a kind gift from patti rosa  <cit> . clones described in this study were generated from the above-mentioned b <dig> clone . all b. burgdorferi clones were cultivated in liquid bsk-ii medium supplemented with 6 % rabbit serum  and incubated at 35 °c under  <dig>  % co <dig>  mutant strains were grown in media supplemented with kanamycin . cell densities and growth phase were monitored by dark-field microscopy and enumerated using a petroff-hausser counting chamber. blood and tissue samples were cultured in bsk-ii supplemented with 6 % rabbit serum and containing borrelia antibiotic cocktail .table  <dig> 
b. burgdorferi clones used in this study




generation of lp28- <dig> mutant clones
the mutant lacking regions bbf1- <dig> was regenerated through targeted deletion as described in a previous publication  <cit> . for deletion of bbf19- <dig> and bbf27- <dig> from lp28- <dig> by allelic exchange, a 500 bp sequence upstream and downstream of each region to be deleted was pcr amplified from the annotated lp28- <dig> sequence  using primers listed in table  <dig>  the resulting dna product was then cloned into the pjet  <dig>  plasmid vector . primers annealing within the 500 bp region were then used to amplify the dna vector excluding the regions to be deleted. an insert containing the aphi gene conferring resistance to kanamycin driven by the flgb promoter of b. burgdorferi was then ligated to this pcr product to create the plasmid dna construct for allelic exchange . the resulting plasmid was then transformed into escherichia coli dh5α competent cells. plasmid dna isolated from individual e. coli clones was verified for correct size and orientation by restriction digest before transformation into b. burgdorferi cells.table  <dig> primers used in this study



b. burgdorferi transformation
b. burgdorferi b31-a <dig> wild-type cells were electroporated and cultured as previously described  <cit> . dna from culture-positive wells was extracted using a dneasy blood and tissue kit , and used for pcr analysis to confirm the presence of the antibiotic-resistance gene and the absence of bbf1- <dig>  bbf19- <dig> or bbf27- <dig> utilizing primer sets described in table  <dig>  plasmid content for each verified transformant was determined by pcr using plasmid-specific primers as previously described  <cit> .

southern blot analysis
total plasmid dna was extracted from b. burgdorferi clones using the plasmid midi kit  and separated on a 1 % agarose gel at 80 v for 23 h . dna was then transferred onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with digoxigenin -labeled probes following manufacturer’s guidelines .

infection of mice
three to four week-old male c3h/hen mice  were infected by subcutaneous needle inoculation with  <dig> total spirochetes per dose. b. burgdorferi clones from frozen glycerol stock were passaged no more than two times in vitro prior to use in mouse infection assays. infection was monitored by culturing either blood samples or ear biopsies at the indicated times post infection. after infection, mice were monitored for presence of infection at day seven by blood collection. tissues for rt-qpcr analysis were collected at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two ear punch biopsies of about 2 mm diameter were collected from each mouse and stored in rna later in −20 °c until rna extraction was done.

rna extraction and gene expression analysis by droplet digital pcr
rna was extracted from the tissues using the rneasy® fibrous tissue mini kit  and treated with the rnase-free dnase set  to remove any residual dna. the concentration, purity and integrity of rna were determined electrophoretically and by measuring the absorbance. the reverse transcription reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 μl using iscript advanced cdna synthesis kit for rt-qpcr  following manufacturers guidelines. a quantity of 100 ng total rna was used as template. following generation of cdna, droplet digital pcr was performed using the qx <dig> droplet digital pcr  system . the ospc and flab genes were amplified using primers and probes shown in table  <dig>  the primer probe mixture, cdna and 1x ddpcr supermix were pipetted into the dg8™ cartridge for droplet formation in the qx <dig> droplet generator. droplets were then transferred into a  <dig> well pcr plate and heat-sealed with a foil plate seal  before placement into the c <dig> touch thermal cycler. reactions were performed in biological replicates in a total volume of 40 μl. cycling parameters  were as follows: enzyme activation was done at 95 °c for 10 min followed by a denaturation for 30 s at 94 °c; annealing and extension for 1 min at 60 °c was repeated for 40 cycles. after pcr, the plate was placed in the qx <dig> droplet reader and relative gene expression determined using the quantasoft software.

statistical analysis
sigmaplot  <dig>  software was used for all statistical data analysis. normalized ospc transcript values from mice infected with the mutant clones were compared to transcript levels from mice infected with the wild type clone on respective days tested. results were analyzed by the student’s t-test and p values ≤ <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
generation of lp28- <dig> mutant b. burgdorferi clones
genetic loci of the lp28- <dig> plasmid containing the genes bbf19- <dig> and bbf27- <dig>  were chosen for mutational analysis to assess their respective roles in b. burgdorferi persistence. deletion of each genetic region was achieved using allelic exchange as shown in fig. 2a. deletion constructs  were generated that carried a kanamycin-resistance gene  driven by a b. burgdorferi flgb promoter flanked by 500 bp homologous sequences upstream and downstream of the targeted region. genetic deletion of the bbf19- <dig> and bbf27- <dig> regions was achieved by insertion of the selectable kan marker by homologous recombination to generate the mutant clones, bb∆19- <dig> and bb∆27- <dig>  respectively. transformants were pcr screened for the presence of the kanamycin-resistance cassette, and clones meeting this criterion were then further analyzed for their total plasmid profile. all clones contained the full plasmid profile, with the exception of cp <dig>  the cp <dig> plasmid is normally absent from the parental b31-a <dig> clone, and is not necessary for infection or pathogenesis  <cit> . to confirm the loss of each region, dna was isolated from bb∆19- <dig> and bb∆27- <dig> and subjected to southern blot analysis . a b. burgdorferi mutant lacking bbf1- <dig> was also generated and verified as previously reported  <cit> . this mutant was included because previous infection studies were only carried out for 28 days, and the intention of this study was to prolong infection for 91 days to assess for long-term infection.fig.  <dig> generation and verification of lp28- <dig> mutant clones of b. burgdorferi. a schematic of the construction strategy for the lp28- <dig> mutant clones bb∆19- <dig> and bb∆27- <dig> by allelic exchange is shown. bb∆1- <dig> was generated by targeted telomere deletion as previously described in a published study  <cit> . to confirm the loss of regions bbf19- <dig> or bbf27- <dig>  dna was isolated and subjected to southern blot analysis . all mutant clones provided a positive signal of the expected size  when probed for the kan cassette. the blot also confirmed the absence of the targeted region in the two mutant clones. wt, wild type; m, dna size marker



lp28- <dig> mutant clones are capable of dissemination and long-term infection in immunocompetent mice
to assess the individual infectivity profiles of the newly generated mutants, groups of six c3h/hen  mice each were needle inoculated with either bb∆1- <dig>  bb∆19- <dig> or bb∆27- <dig> clones. two groups of three c3h mice each were infected with wild type or lp28-1-deficient  b. burgdorferi clones to serve as positive and negative controls, respectively. as shown in table  <dig>  blood samples collected at day  <dig> post infection produced positive cultures for spirochetes in all inoculated mouse groups except with the bb∆19- <dig> mutant. positive blood cultures were obtained from only  <dig> out of  <dig> mice infected with the bb∆19- <dig> clone. this pattern was also observed for this same group of mice at day  <dig> after culture of ear biopsies, suggesting a possible delay in dissemination to this tissue site. at day  <dig> post infection, cultures were positive for spirochetes in mice infected with wild type, bb∆1- <dig> and bb∆27- <dig>  as expected, spirochetes could not be detected from tissues collected from day  <dig> onwards from mice infected with the bbΔlp28- <dig> clone due to the lack of lp28- <dig>  <cit> . long-term infection  was conducted to assess whether the bb∆1- <dig>  bb∆19- <dig> and bb∆27- <dig> mutant clones would eventually be cleared in infected mice. ear biopsies were collected at days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection, and mice were sacrificed at day  <dig> to harvest heart, bladder, ear, and joint tissues for spirochete culture. ear biopsies and cultured tissues from all mice were found to be culture positive, demonstrating that the bb∆1- <dig>  bb∆19- <dig> and bb∆27- <dig> clones were fully capable of dissemination and long-term persistent infection .table  <dig> infectivity of b. burgdorferi clones in c3h mice

lp28- <dig> mutants are capable of downregulating ospc expression during host infection
associated with the development of the host-acquired immune response is ospc downregulation and increased synthesis of vlse on lp28- <dig>  <cit> . to determine if the deletion of bbf1- <dig>  bbf19- <dig> or bbf27- <dig> has an effect on ospc expression during infection of a murine host, groups of  <dig> c3h mice each were needle inoculated with  <dig> spirochetes of either bb∆1- <dig>  bb∆19- <dig> or bb∆27- <dig>  two additional groups were infected with wild type or bbΔlp28- <dig> clones to serve as controls. for each group, mice were infected for a duration of either  <dig> or 91 days; these time points were chosen to assess ospc expression levels during early and late stages of infection, respectively. on day  <dig> and  <dig> post infection, heart and bladder tissue samples were collected for rna extraction. ear biopsy tissue was also collected on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for rna extraction as a way to assess the ospc transcription profile during infection without sacrificing mice. expression of ospc was normalized against the flab housekeeping gene and compared to mrna of late log phase in vitro-grown b. burgdorferi wild type.

relative expression levels of ospc transcripts were determined by digital droplet pcr . flab and ospc transcripts were detected at day  <dig> in tissues collected from mice infected with bbΔlp28- <dig> clone, which correlated with culture results . data for this clone was not collected after day  <dig> as all mice successfully cleared infection after this time point. relative levels of ospc expression between tissues infected with the wild type and mutant clones were compared using a student’s t-test. results presented in fig. 3a show normalized ospc expression from spirochetes in bladder tissue relative to flab transcripts. no significant difference was observed between the wild type and mutant clones recovered from bladder tissues at day  <dig>  at day  <dig> post infection, ospc expression by bbΔ1- <dig> spirochetes collected from bladder tissues of mice was significantly repressed relative to that from wild type-infected bladders . no statistical difference was noted with the other clones. spirochetes recovered from heart tissue at both day  <dig> and  <dig> showed no significant difference in ospc expression .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of ospc transcript levels in various tissue sites of infected mice. ospc expression profile of spirochetes recovered from the bladder , heart , and ear tissue  of mice infected with wild type, bb∆1- <dig>  bb∆19- <dig> or bb∆27- <dig> is shown. ospc expression was normalized against flab and compared to mrna of in vitro-grown b. burgdorferi wild-type cells grown to late log phase. asterisks show mutant clones with ospc expression levels that were statistically different from the wild type using statistical analyses described in methods. a) in bladder tissue, no difference in ospc expression was observed at day  <dig>  at day  <dig>  spirochetes from wild type-infected tissues had a statistically significant difference when compared to bb∆1- <dig> infected tissues . b) spirochetes in heart tissue samples showed no significant difference when compared to wild type-infected tissues at both days  <dig> and  <dig>  c) spirochetes in the ear tissue showed a general decline in ospc expression from day  <dig>  which was lowest at day  <dig> and started to rise at day  <dig>  there was no significant difference in ospc expression noted at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  at day  <dig>  spirochetes from mice infected with bb∆19- <dig> had a higher expression of ospc when compared to those infected by the wild type . **flab and ospc transcripts were detected at day  <dig> in tissues collected from mice infected with bbΔlp28- <dig> clone, which correlated with culture results . data for this clone was not collected after day  <dig> as all mice successfully cleared infection after this time point



for ear tissue, normalized ospc expression could be determined from day  <dig> onwards . no significant difference in ospc expression was observed between wild type and the mutant clones recovered from infected ear tissues collected at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  at day  <dig> post infection, the bbΔ19- <dig> clone was found to have a significantly higher level of ospc expression compared to the wild type , while no difference was noted with the other two mutant clones. taken together, the results from the mice infection studies and rt-qpcr analysis suggest that the lp28- <dig> regions targeted for deletion are not important for persistent infection by b. burgdorferi, and have little to no lasting effects on the expression/repression of ospc.

discussion
gene conversion at the vls locus on lp28- <dig> results in antigenic variation of vlse, which has been demonstrated repeatedly to be essential for immune evasion and persistence by the lyme disease pathogen  <cit> . the question remained whether lack of the vls locus alone explains the intermediate infectivity phenotype exhibited by clones lacking the lp28- <dig> plasmid. previous studies have excluded all remaining genes as having an effect on persistent infection, with the exception of the genetic loci bbf19- <dig> and bbf27- <dig>  <cit> . a b. burgdorferi mutant lacking bbf1- <dig> that was previously reported  <cit>  was included in the present study because previous infection studies were only carried out for 28 days, and the intention of this study was to prolong infection for 91 days to assess long-term persistence. the bbf1- <dig> region has several conserved coding regions, short genes, and pseudogenes. in addition, a number of genes in this region  have been identified as potentially important for infectivity  <cit> . the bbf19- <dig> region encodes one pseudogene , a conserved hypothetical protein , a short gene  and a putative p <dig> protein . region bbf27- <dig> encodes mostly short genes  and one pseudogene . by day  <dig> post infection, ospc transcript levels from all tissue samples collected from mice infected with mutant or wild type spirochetes were greatly reduced suggesting that the mutations generated within lp28- <dig> did not affect ospc down regulation. this is indicative of either immune selection against spirochetes that abundantly express this lipoprotein and/or persistence of spirochetes that decrease its expression. moreover, a general increase in ospc expression by both the wild type and mutant clones was observed in infected ear and bladder tissues at days  <dig> and  <dig>  which coincides with the reported decline of anti-ospc antibody  <cit>  .

overall, relatively comparable ospc expression levels were observed for the wild type and mutant clones. the wild type clone generally showed higher levels of ospc expression, with the exception of day  <dig> when bbΔ19- <dig> mutant spirochetes colonizing ear tissue exhibited significantly higher expression levels. initial delay in tissue colonization was also observed with this mutant at days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection. in the end, the higher ospc expression levels did not correspond to clearance of spirochete infection as demonstrated by the long-term mouse infection studies.

from the data presented in this study, the lp28- <dig> regions targeted for deletion are not important for persistent infection by b. burgdorferi, and have little to no lasting effects on the expression/repression of ospc. however, it is conceivable that the regions under study may have a detectable phenotype in mice when given a lower inoculum dose. moreover, it is possible that these regions could play a role in other aspects of infectivity; both possibilities will require further study.

CONCLUSIONS
the data reported herein indicate that regions bbf1- <dig>  bbf19- <dig> and bbf27- <dig> of lp28- <dig> are not involved in persistent infection by b. burgdorferi, and do not critically alter the overall expression levels of ospc during murine infection leading to immune clearance. moreover, along with the previous data involving mutation of non-vls loci on lp28- <dig>  these findings suggest that the vls locus may be the sole genetic element on this plasmid responsible for immune evasion and persistence exhibited by the lyme disease pathogen.
