BACKGROUND
male courtship sounds are an adapted trait for attracting females and increasing reproductive success  <cit> . recently, mice were found to emit ultrasonic vocalizations  in response to females or their urine  <cit> . usvs were shown to be functional in attracting females in play-back experiments  <cit> .

mice are an important model for the genetics of behavior; so mouse usvs have been a focus in studies of genetic mechanisms underlying animal communication. mice knocked out for the foxp <dig>  drd <dig>  or vasopressin receptor genes are known to produce abnormal usvs in terms of the length, frequency, and number of sound emissions  <cit> , suggesting that genetic factors contribute to the development of vocalization pathways  <cit> .

beyond these quantitative traits, recent studies have focused on the qualitative mechanisms underlying the temporal and spectral features of mouse usvs. it was shown that the courtship usv of male mice has a song-like structure, which is composed of syllables in discrete categories where the syllables are arranged in a sequential order with a preferred transition between the syllables  <cit> .

the syllable repertoire of bird song is modulated by environmental factors, but recent cross-fostering experiments indicate that mouse usvs are genetic  <cit> . however, it is not known how genetic mechanisms are involved in the organization of specific usv sequences.

here, we compared the syllable patterns of courtship usvs between  <dig> and b <dig> mice, which are the most common genetic backgrounds used in gene-targeting experiments. we describe the existence of two genetic loci that follow the rules of mendelian inheritance and control the selection of specific syllables, thereby contributing to the diversity of courtship usvs.

RESULTS
different syllable organizations in  <dig> and b <dig> strains of mice
male mice usvs were induced by introducing a b <dig> female at estrus stage. male mice exhibited sniffing, chasing, and mounting behaviors, as previously reported  <cit> . usvs emitted during sniffing behaviors were compared to avoid potentially confounding effects with different behaviors  <cit> .

usv patterns were characterized by visual inspection of sonograms and it was found that <dig> and b <dig> males had mutually exclusive phenotypes. based on previously published criteria for syllable classification  <cit>  it was determined that  <dig> mice frequently repeated chevron-type syllables, whereas b <dig> mice used short-type syllables in their repeats . the chevron-rich repeats are referred to as "chevron-wave" usvs, while the short-rich repeats are referred to as "staccato" usvs. these results suggest that b <dig> and  <dig> mice have different syllable preferences during the generation of courtship usvs.

quantification of syllable composition indicated that chevron-type syllables were infrequently used by b <dig> mice, but they were dominant in  <dig> mice. short-type syllables were significantly more commonly used by b <dig> mice compared with  <dig> mice  =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  for strain × syllable type; for chevron or short, p <  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig>  student-newman-keuls  multiple comparison test), although they had the capacity to generate both syllable types . both strains showed no significant differences in the emission of other syllable types .

average frequencies  and duration  of syllables compared among  <dig>  b <dig>  and f <dig>  overall, b <dig> had a higher average peak frequency than  <dig> males. f <dig> lay in the middle of the two.  <dig> produced longer cv, cx, and os. f <dig> lay in the middle of the two.

furthermore, there were no significant differences in the number of sniffs or syllables emitted, which reflects the motivational effect on usv emission . these results suggest that the chevron-wave and staccato phenotypes of b <dig> and  <dig> mice strains were associated with specific preferences in these strains for selecting chevrons or short syllables, despite their similar responsiveness in females.

f <dig> males produce a b6-like usv
the genetic relationship between the staccato and chevron-wave phenotypes was addressed by generating f <dig> mice using both  <dig> ♀ × b <dig> ♂, and b <dig> ♀ ×  <dig> ♂, matings. interestingly, the proportion of short and chevron usv syllables produced by f <dig> males was similar to that produced by b <dig> males and differ from  <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; short: p <  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig> or f <dig> and p =  <dig>  for b <dig> vs. f1; chevron: p <  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig> and p =  <dig>  for b <dig> vs. f1). the b6-like usvs of f <dig> mice were also unaffected by the paternal genotype . a high proportion of frequently repeated short-type syllables was produced by the f <dig> mice , as found in b <dig> mice . f <dig> mice exhibited a similar amount of sniffing behavior  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and emitted a lower number of syllables during sniffing behavior when compared with their parental strains . these results suggest that staccato is the dominant phenotype, while chevron-wave is recessive.

usv composition was not dependent on the female strain
the different usv patterns of b <dig> and  <dig> males could be attributable to differences in their responsiveness to b <dig> females, i.e., b <dig> males might be exposed to females with the same genetic background, whereas  <dig> males might encounter females of different strains. to address this issue, we compared their responsiveness to  <dig> females. however, the relative syllable composition of each strain was not significantly affected by  <dig> females  =  <dig>  p =  <dig>  two way repeated measures anova; p =  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig> female, snk test; b <dig> male: f =  <dig>  p = 1; p =  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig>  snk test). these results suggest it was unlikely that differences in the usv phenotypes of b <dig> and  <dig> males  were due to motivational preferences associated with female stains.

repetition of a specific syllable in b <dig>   <dig> and f1mice
to compare the degree of repetition of either short and chevron-type syllable among genotypes, we first measure the onset probability of those syllables along usv sequences . strain b <dig> or f <dig> produced more short repeats than  <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; p <  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig> or f <dig>  p =  <dig>  b <dig> vs. f <dig>  snk test;  <dig> ×- <dig> × short repeats, p <  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig> or f <dig>  snk test). chevron repeats were more frequent in  <dig> compared with b <dig> or f <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; p < <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig> or f <dig>  p =  <dig>  for b <dig> vs. f1;  <dig> ×- <dig> × short repeats, p <  <dig>  for  <dig> vs. b <dig> and f <dig>  snk method].

the biased preference for syllables was also found to be expressed in repeated syllables. for example, all b <dig> or f <dig> mice had the capacity to generate more than  <dig> × short repeats, whereas only 17% of the  <dig> mice produced  <dig> × short repeats . in contrast, all  <dig> males had the capacity to produce four or more chevron repeats , while few of the b <dig>  or f <dig> mice produced  <dig> × chevron repeats . these results suggest that the different usv patterns found in  <dig> and b <dig> mice  were associated with different syllable preferences of mice, both in terms of random selection and syllable repetition.

short-rich and chevron-rich phenotypes were segregated in f <dig> generations
usvs of f <dig> mice obtained from the mating of f <dig> mice were analyzed to determine whether the mutually exclusive staccato and chevron-wave usv phenotypes were different alleles at the same genetic locus . b <dig> and f <dig> usvs were exclusively composed of short-type syllables, whereas the chevron-type was preferred by  <dig> mice ; however, f <dig> mice produced a more diverse composition of short-type and chevron-type syllables . many f <dig> mice emitted 129-like usvs , although a larger proportion of f <dig> mice produced b6-like usvs . furthermore, new types of mice were found that produced mixed-type usvs, while others lacked both staccato and chevron-wave repeats  in their usvs. this suggests that at least two separate genetic loci determine the preference for syllable usage, i.e., one for the chevron-wave and another for the staccato repeat phenotypes.

syllable repetition phenotypes were diversified also. only c. 25% of the f <dig> mice exhibited the repetition of chevron syllables more than four times , so the allele for chevron repetition preference appears to be recessive. approximately 75% of the f <dig> mice produced usvs containing short-rich syllables repeated more than four times , which indicates the dominance of this phenotype as also observed in the f <dig> generation.

discussion
our results suggest that at least two genetic loci are responsible for the different syllable patterns of courtship usvs produced by  <dig> and b <dig> mice. analysis of usvs in f <dig> mice showed that the chevron-rich usv repetition is a recessive phenotype, while the short-rich repetition is a dominant phenotype . the appearance of various combinations of those two phenotypes in the f <dig> generation suggests that these phenotypes are generated by two independent genetic loci . the two genetic loci are critical for the organization of syllable sequences in usvs. b <dig> and  <dig> mice share a similar ancestor  <cit> , but allelic variations of genes and homozygosity for these alleles during the breeding of the two inbred strains may have led to the current phenotypes, which are defined by the redundant repetition of specific syllables.

what is the biological role of the two loci? it is unlikely that these loci control the capacity for the generation of specific syllables per se during prenatal development. if this hypothesis was true, adult b <dig> mice that are dominated by the usage of short-type syllables would be physically unable to generate chevron-type syllables. previous reports show that b <dig> pups have no defects in the generation of specific types of syllables  <cit> . the current study also confirmed that adult b <dig> males can generate other types of syllables . gene knockout studies also showed that the syllable repertoire mechanism can be dissociated from structural problems, i.e., muscarinic receptor  <cit>  or vasopressin 1b receptor  <cit>  knockouts resulted in abnormal pitch, amplitude, or emission events when compared with wild-type mice, but there were no reported defects in terms of usv syllable structure.

a second hypothesis could explain the function of the two loci based on a paternal effect theory, which is used to explain the diversity of song patterns in songbirds. it is interesting to note that the syllabic makeup of emitted usvs changed as the mice aged. the usvs of b <dig> pups contained a larger proportion of chevron-type syllables   <cit>  compared with juvenile mice   <cit> , as found in the current study . furthermore,  <dig> mice exhibited an increase to ~30% chevron usage as adults, from only 10% chevron syllable usage as pups  <cit> . the age-dependent differentiation of the usv repertoire was not likely to be attributable to paternal effects, because the usv pattern of f <dig> mice was unaffected by the paternal genetic background .

a third hypothesis proposes that two loci are involved in the selection of syllables in the generation of usvs through an unknown mechanism. the results of the current study suggest that genetic recombination may be responsible for the composition of the usv syllable repertoire. identifying the genetic component might help to understand the development of vocal communication in mice. it is plausible to assume that if selection is directed by multiple genes, then the combination of specific alleles may lead to complex patterns of usvs. this is consistent with the current study's observation of a diverse pattern of usvs in f <dig> mice, resulting from a b <dig> ×  <dig> cross. b6-like and 129-like usv patterns were observed, but novel usv patterns with both or none alleles emerged in the f <dig> generation. this might be due to independent inheritance of the two alleles and reciprocal masking of recessive and dominant alleles by genetic recombination. the results of the current study suggest that genetic recombination might be responsible for the complexity of the usv repertoire, which is known to play a critical role in female choice and reproductive success. it remains to be elucidated whether usvs with repetition of the same type syllable are more efficient for attracting females when compared with usvs containing a complex combination of many syllables.

the f <dig> hybrid of b <dig> and  <dig> is suggested as an ideal genetic background for the study of gene knockout mice, because the effects of homozygous recessive mutations accumulate in the two inbred mice strains  <cit> . however, the current study suggests that f <dig> mice should be used carefully in usv analysis, because dominant mutations in b <dig> mice can produce a short-rich usv phenotype in the f <dig> genetic background . the biased usv phenotype of f <dig> mice due to the dominant mutation produces difficulties when evaluating the effectst of targeted gene on the expression of various syllables. to avoid this problem, various genetic backgrounds should be used in the analysis of mouse usvs with targeted mutations, as previously suggested  <cit> .

the repetition of specific syllables is also seen in human speech disorders. some patients with tourette syndrome  <cit>  or parkinson's disease  <cit>  exhibit palilalia, which is the continuous repetition of a phrase or specific syllables. mechanisms underlying chevron-repeats or short-repeats might be shared by human speech disorders. finally, the characterization of genes underlying syllable selection might provide profound insights into the evolutionary history of sound communication and the mechanism of human speech disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that the selection of specific syllables in courtship usvs is controlled by a genetic mechanism in mice. at least two genetic loci are associated with the staccato and chevron-wave alleles of b <dig> and  <dig> mice, which control syllable preference combinations for these alleles and produce a diverse usv repertoire, even in the f <dig> generation. the diversification of the courtship usv repertoire in these alleles may contribute to the fitness of mice in nature. further playback experiments to females with staccato and chevron-wave songs could help to explain this issue. furthermore, the identification of these two loci will provide insights into the neural pathways that control the organization of syllable sequences and possibly aid the understanding of language disorders in humans.
