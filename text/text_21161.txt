BACKGROUND
retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements present, often in large numbers, in most eukaryotic genomes. they spread through the copying of rna transcripts into dna and the insertion of these dnas into new sites in the host genome. most retrotransposons can be classified into one of three classes  <cit> . the first of these is known as the long terminal repeat  retrotransposons. the integrated forms of these elements are flanked by ltrs. these elements copy their rna into dna within cytoplasmic particles. the completed dna copy is then moved to the nucleus and inserted into the host genome. members of the second major class of retrotransposons, the tyrosine recombinase  retrotransposons  <cit> , contain either inverted repeats or split direct repeats. they are thought to produce circular, extrachromosomal dna intermediates which are integrated into the host genome via the actions of an encoded tyrosine recombinase. members of the third major class  <cit>  lack extensive repeat sequences. these elements copy their rna into dna directly at the targeted insertion site, using a 3' oh exposed by nicking of the target dna as a primer. these elements are variously referred to as non-ltr retrotransposons, poly-a retrotransposons, retroposons or lines . here, we shall refer to them as target-primed  retrotransposons, following the suggestions of curcio and derbyshire  <cit> .

the l <dig> element is the most commonly encountered tp retrotransposon in mammals . in humans, l <dig> is the single most abundant feature in the genome, comprising about 17% of the sequence  <cit> , and being responsible for at least another 11% through providing the replication machinery for processed pseudogenes  <cit> , the abundant alu elements  <cit>  and probably also sva elements  <cit> . l <dig> elements are also likely to have played an important part in the evolution of the structure and activity of the remainder of the genome, by providing dispersed sites of sequence similarity at which recombination can occur  <cit> , by inserting into genes altering their structure and/or regulation  <cit> , and by carrying flanking sequences with them during transposition   <cit> .

an intact l <dig> element is about  <dig> kb in length and consists of two long open reading frames  which are flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions  and separated by a short interorf region  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes a protein with nucleic acid-binding and nucleic acid-chaperone activities  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes a protein with endonuclease   <cit>  and reverse transcriptase   <cit>  domains as well as a c-terminal cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like domain  of unknown function  <cit> . the 5' utr contains an internal promoter that drives transcription of the element  <cit> . the activity of this promoter may be influenced by the upstream flanking sequence  <cit> . the 3' utr contains a poly-adenylation signal and is followed by a poly-a tail which varies in length in different copies.

despite the abundance and importance of tp retrotransposons, many features of their replication are as yet only poorly understood. much of what is known is based upon biochemical analyses of the target-primed r <dig> element from bombyx mori  <cit> . r <dig> inserts at a specific site within the b. mori ribosomal rna gene arrays. it consists of a single long orf flanked by 5' and 3' utrs. the orf encodes a protein with en and rt activities. following translation, the proteins associate with the mrna and the resulting ribonucleoprotein complex then associates with the target site in the genomic dna. here the en domain generates a single-stranded nick in the target site, exposing a free 3'-oh group, which is then used by the rt to prime first-strand dna synthesis, using the r <dig> rna as a template. the latter steps of retrotransposition are not well understood but presumably include the nicking of the second strand of the target site, the synthesis of second-strand dna and the sealing of the ends. this model for retrotransposition is thought to be applicable to all tp retrotransposons  <cit> . in the case of l <dig> , the retrotransposon-encoded proteins have a strong tendency to mobilize the rna that encoded them, a phenomenon known as cis-preference  <cit> . this is likely mediated by the nascent proteins remaining associated with the mrna from which they were translated.

in efforts to further dissect the replication mechanisms of tp elements, several model systems have been developed that permit the retrotransposition of marked elements of defined sequence to be followed in vivo. the most widely used of these are based on human or rodent l <dig> elements. by studying the effects of various mutations within the l <dig> sequence, and by analysing the structures of numerous retrotransposed copies, much has been learned about the l <dig> retrotransposition process and the effect this has on the host genome . nevertheless, despite the advances resulting from these mammalian systems, some aspects of the retrotransposition process, in particular the role played by host genes, might be more easily studied in simpler systems. assays in yeasts such as saccharomyces cerevisiae or schizosaccharomyces pombe, with their small genomes, well understood genetics and relative ease of generating host gene knockouts, would make valuable additions to currently available assays. unfortunately, tp elements are not found in either s. cerevisiae  <cit>  or s. pombe  <cit> , so such a system has not been available to date. in addition, while the tad <dig> tp retrotransposon of the widely used fungus neurospora crassa has been shown to retrotranspose  <cit> , a system permitting detailed analyses of the retrotransposition of this element has not yet been developed.

we recently reported the existence of three families of tp elements in the yeast candida albicans  <cit> . we suggested that one of these, zorro <dig>  might make a useful yeast model for tp retrotransposition as  it is apparently intact ,  it is closely related to the human l <dig> element,  it is similar in structure to l <dig> , with non-overlapping orfs, similar protein domains, and with an ~250-bp 3' utr terminating in a poly-a tail, and  it appears to have transposed recently , which suggests that it has recently been active and may still be so. in this report we describe the development of an assay system for studying the retrotransposition of zorro <dig>  this is the first assay system for studying a tp retrotransposon in a simple microbial model system and it should significantly advance the study of these elements.

RESULTS
defining the structure of a yeast tp retrotransposon
prior to this work only one full-length sequence of zorro <dig> was available , together with a single sequence of a 5'-truncated element, and two partial sequences, one containing a 5' end and the other a 3' end  <cit> . these were all derived from the c. albicans genome sequencing project strain, sc <dig>  <cit> . related empty sites were also available for some insertions  allowing the 5' and 3' ends to be defined. before attempting to develop a retrotransposition assay, we wished to obtain further data as to whether the one apparently full-length sequence was likely to represent a functional version of the element. in particular, we wished to examine the 5' end and the interorf region in more detail. the 5' end is unusual in that it begins with a poly-a sequence and in that there is only a very short distance  between the end of the poly-a sequence and the first available atg codon of orf <dig>  for the interorf region, we wished to check whether the non-overlapping orfs and a poly-a tract found between the orfs are general features of zorro <dig> elements.

the sequences of two additional zorro <dig> 5' ends were obtained by inverse pcr from c. albicans strain atcc <dig> . each of these elements was inserted at a different site to any zorro <dig> insertion in sc <dig>  in agreement with previous results obtained by southern blotting  <cit> . the atcc <dig> elements both have 5' ends identical to those of the two found in sc <dig>  i.e., beginning with a poly-a tract and with only a very short 5' utr. in addition, comparisons between the sequences flanking these elements and the related empty sites in sc <dig> , revealed that both elements had inserted into short poly-a tracts, as have the elements in sc <dig> , suggesting that zorro <dig> elements might preferentially integrate at such sequences.

further sequences of the region between orf <dig> and orf <dig> of zorro <dig> elements were obtained by pcr using dna from ten unrelated isolates of c. albicans. each additional zorro <dig> sequence was found to have an interorf region identical, or very nearly so, to that of the sequenced element from sc <dig>  i.e., in all cases orf <dig> and orf <dig> do not overlap and the interorf region contains an extensive poly-a tract.

in addition, further sequences  of zorro3-like elements were obtained from a close relative of c. albicans, candida dubliniensis, both by pcr and by analysis of data from a c. dubliniensis genome sequencing project  <cit> . comparisons of the elements from two different species assists in the identification of functionally important sequences, as unimportant sequences will have had time to diverge considerably. we found that the c. dubliniensis zorro3-like elements have similar features to the sequenced copy of zorro <dig> from c. albicans, i.e., they begin and end in poly-a tracts, they have only very short 5' utrs, and orf <dig> and orf <dig> are non-overlapping and separated by an interorf region bearing a poly-a tract . furthermore, analysis of related empty sites suggested that these elements had all inserted into short poly-a tracts.

overall, these findings indicate that the sequenced version of zorro <dig> is likely to represent the intact structure of the element, despite its several unusual features.

a retrotransposition assay for zorro3
constructs for studying zorro <dig> retrotransposition were built by sequentially incorporating pcr-derived sequences into bacterial plasmids as described in the methods section. the construct used in much of the work described here, ppz3ta , contains a full-length zorro <dig> element with a retrotransposition indicator gene inserted into its 3' utr. the retrotransposition indicator gene is the same as that used previously to study retrotransposition of the c. albicans ltr retrotransposon tca <dig>  <cit> , and consists of the orf of the c. albicans ura <dig> gene and  <dig> bp of its promoter sequence, with the orf disrupted by an antisense intron. this indicator gene is inserted into the zorro <dig> 3' utr so that the ura <dig> orf is on the opposite strand to the zorro <dig> orfs. the zorro <dig> element in ppz3ta is preceded by  <dig> bp from the c. albicans act <dig> gene promoter region and is followed by  <dig> bp of its natural 3' context, then  <dig> bp from the act <dig> terminator region. the plasmid also contains an allele of the c. albicans imh <dig> gene  <cit>  that confers resistance to the antibiotic mycophenolic acid , for selection of the plasmid in c. albicans, and the orf region of the c. albicans rp <dig> gene  <cit> . the plasmid can be linearised at a unique pin ai site within the rp <dig> orf to target integration to the genomic rp <dig> locus. this site has been suggested as a good site for integration and expression of transforming dna in c. albicans  <cit> .

the strategy by which plasmid ppz3ta can be used to study retrotransposition of the cloned zorro <dig> element  is similar to that used previously for other systems  <cit> . first, the plasmid is introduced into a auxotrophic strain of c. albicans, cai <dig>  <cit> , which has had both copies of its ura <dig> gene deleted, using the mpa-resistance gene for selection. the transformants will initially remain auxotrophs as the marker gene on the plasmid is inactive due to the antisense intron. splicing of the intron from a sense transcript of the marked zorro <dig> element, and retrotransposition of the spliced transcript, i.e., its copying into dna and integration into the host genome, will, however, result in the appearance of a stably integrated, functional ura <dig> gene. expression of this gene would confer a ura3+ phenotype on the host cell. thus, retrotransposition events can be detected by the appearance of ura3+ colonies on the appropriate selective media.

a marked zorro <dig> element retrotransposes in c. albicans
plasmid ppz3ta was introduced into c. albicans strain cai <dig> using selection for resistance to mpa. the resulting mpa-resistant transformants were isolated, grown in liquid culture, then plated onto selective media lacking uridine and incubated at 22°, 27° or 37°c. no colonies arose on the 37° plates, but, after four to five days, colonies, representing potential retrotransposition events, began to appear on the 22° and 27° plates .

to test whether these colonies result from genuine retrotransposition events  the structures of their ura <dig> genes were examined. pcr amplification of dna isolated from the ura3+ colonies using primers that flank the intron insertion site in the antisense ura <dig> gene produced two bands, one of a size expected from the introduced tagged zorro <dig> element and the other slightly smaller . for two independent colonies this smaller band was cloned and sequenced. in both cases a ura <dig> gene from which the antisense intron had been precisely removed was detected. this indicates that the marker gene is derived from a spliced mrna molecule and that the element has therefore been retrotransposed.

eight different ura3+ derivatives, four from each of two independent ppz3ta transformants, were analysed by southern blotting to determine whether the retrotransposed copies of the tagged zorro <dig> element had inserted into different sites in the genome, as expected for genuine retrotransposition events . this was indeed found to be the case. each ura3+ derivative had a single additional band hybridising to a ura <dig> probe relative to their ura3- parents, and these bands were of different sizes in each of the eight strains analysed. this work suggests that the ura3+ cells derived from ppz3ta transformants are a result of genuine retrotransposition events, and furthermore, they show that most, if not all, of these colonies have arisen independently.

the 3' ends of retrotransposed zorro <dig> elements
as a first step towards a detailed examination of the structure of the retrotransposed copies of the tagged zorro <dig> elements, the 3' ends of  <dig> independent copies were amplified by inverse pcr and sequenced . the 3' end was chosen for initial analysis for two reasons: one, it is close to the marker gene, so a primer straddling the insertion site of the intron in the marker can be used, which makes the reaction specific for retrotransposed copies of the element , and two, tp retrotransposons are often variably 5' truncated, leading to difficulties in designing a primer pair capable of amplifying all 5' ends.

a assembly  <dig> contigs generally come in pairs of similar sequence representing portions of putative homologous chromosome pairs. members of the pairs are distinguished by either a  <dig> or  <dig> at the start of the contig number, eg.  <dig> and  <dig>  in the cases where the zorro <dig> insertion site can be assigned to a particular homolog the number of that contig is shown. in cases where the insertion could lie on either of the homologs the first digit of the contig number is replaced by an x. the positions of the insertions within the contigs and their orientations, forward  or reverse , are shown in parentheses.

b the nature of the 5' end of each element is given. for a majority of elements the 5' ends are the same as those of the full-length endogenous insertions . several elements were greater than full-length, i.e., extending back into the act <dig> promoter sequence. the precise lengths of act <dig> promoter sequences in these elements could not be determined as in all cases the similarity between the retrotransposed sequences and the act <dig> promoter sequences ended within runs of a residues. some elements had recombined with endogenous full-length zorro <dig> elements ). some elements had recombined with an endogenous 5' truncated/inverted zorro <dig> element in such a way that the resulting insertion lacks a 5' end ; see text).

c the nature of the 3' end of each element is given. for most elements the 3' ends are the same as those of the endogenous insertions . some end earlier within either the zorro <dig> 3' utr or within the ura <dig> promoter sequence.

d insertion site corresponds to chromosome  <dig> in c. albicans strain wo- <dig>  the chromosomal origin of contigs 19– <dig> and 19– <dig> in strain sc <dig> is not known due to conflicing data.

e the length of the target poly-a tract varies in the two homologs.

f the length of the 5' poly-a tract in each of these insertions is determined by the length of the 5' poly-a tract of the endogenous element that was involved in the recombination event.

g data not conclusive for these two insertions.

h several t residues are found within the 5' poly-a tract of this element. na not applicable.

we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> new retrotransposed copies of zorro <dig> extended to the natural 3' end of zorro <dig>  one ended upstream of the natural 3' end within the zorro <dig> 3' utr, and two ended even further upstream within the promoter region of the ura <dig> marker gene. none of the  <dig> contained any 3' transduced sequence, i.e., the 3' flanking sequence of the donor element  was not retrotransposed. all  <dig> copies  ended in a poly-a tract. these varied in length between seven and  <dig> bp, with  <dig> of the  <dig> being between  <dig> and  <dig> bp long, inclusive.

insertion sites of zorro <dig> elements
sequencing of the inverse pcr products revealed not only the structure of the 3' ends of the elements but also their 3' flanking sequences. the latter could then be used to determine  the nature of the insertion site prior to the retrotransposition event and the context of the insertion site in relation to other genomic features. the insertion sites were found to be distributed throughout the c. albicans genome, with representatives found on seven of the eight chromosomes and more events on the larger chromosomes  than on smaller ones . most elements were found to have inserted at unique sites, although three pairs of elements inserted at the same sites were found . for two of these pairs the same site was certainly targeted independently as the ura3+ colonies were isolated independently from ura3- parents. each of the new insertion sites was distinct from any previously identified zorro <dig> insertion site. the new retrotransposed copies were all found to have integrated at short poly-a sequences, varying in length between  <dig> and  <dig> consecutive a residues, with  <dig> of  <dig> being between  <dig> and  <dig> bp  in length. none of the elements had inserted into an orf, despite coding regions comprising  <dig> % of the c. albicans genome  <cit> . many of the elements, however, had inserted very close to coding regions  and there seemed to be a bias towards locations near the 5' ends of orfs, with  <dig> of  <dig> insertions being between divergently transcribed orfs,  <dig> between those in a head-to-tail arrangement and only one between orfs that are convergently transcribed . no particular association could be identified between the insertion sites and other identifiable genomic features, such as trna genes, subtelomeric regions, or retrotransposon ltrs and other repetitive sequences. the findings suggest that the tagged zorro <dig> elements specifically integrate at poly-a sequences and may be biased towards promoter regions. this is similar to the potential preferences  that have been identified for endogenous zorro <dig> insertions.

the 5' ends of retrotransposed zorro <dig> elements
once the 3' flanking sequence of a particular zorro <dig> insertion was identified we used the c. albicans genome sequence data to predict what the 5' flanking sequence would be. primers designed to this sequence were then used in pcrs in combination with a series of reverse primers along the length of zorro <dig>  to identify the 5' end of the insertion. by this method we identified the 5' ends of  <dig> of the  <dig> insertions . twelve of these are full-length elements, ending precisely at the natural 5' end. six insertions are greater than full-length, i.e., extending beyond the natural 5' end to include up to  <dig> bp of the 3' end of the act <dig> promoter sequence. similar transductions of 5' flanking sequence have been observed for l <dig> elements  <cit> . the 19th insertion is 5' truncated within the orf <dig> region. each element begins with a poly-a sequence, between six and ~ <dig> residues in length. the 5' flanking sequence of each insertion extends to the genomic poly-a tract that appears to have been targeted by the element, i.e., there are no large deletions or duplications at the target sites .

the 5' ends of the remaining eleven insertions could not be identified by the above method. the 5' end of one of these insertions was, however, subsequently identified using inverse pcr and it was found to coincide precisely with the 5' end of one of the endogenous full-length zorro <dig> insertions. this suggested that a recombination event had occurred between the new insertion of the tagged element and the endogenous element. we therefore designed primers to regions upstream of each of the full-length zorro <dig> elements in the genome  and used these primers in pcrs in combination with primers specific to each of the tagged elements whose 5' ends had not yet been identified. an additional five elements  were found to have recombined with full-length endogenous insertions . three had recombined with an endogenous insertion on chromosome  <dig>  one with an endogenous insertion on chromosome r and two with a full-length element on chromosome  <dig> that had been introduced on the transformation vector. in each case the new retrotransposed element and the endogenous full-length element that it had recombined with were located on the same chromosome. the distance between the insertion sites for elements of each pair ranged from about  <dig> bp to about  <dig> kb . five of the six pairs of recombining elements were located in the same orientation and the recombination events presumably resulted in the deletion of the intervening sequences. events very similar to these have been found associated with new l <dig> retrotransposition events in mammalian cells  <cit> . these chimaeric elements were proposed to arise during target-primed reverse transcription by recombination between the single-stranded l <dig> cdnas produced during the initial stages of the reaction and the endogenous elements. a similar process could have given rise to the chimaeric zorro <dig> insertions.

the 5' ends of the remaining five insertions could not be detected by any of the above methods. unexpectedly, however, for several of these elements we could obtain pcr products using single primers located downstream of the 3' ends of the elements. sequencing of these pcr products and additional pcr experiments  indicated that these elements had undergone recombinations with an endogenous zorro <dig> element located on chromosome r that is 5' truncated and also includes  <dig>  kb of inverted zorro <dig> sequence. the recombination events had lead to the duplication of the 3' flanking sequence to each end of the now recombinant 5' truncated/inverted element and the loss of the 5' flanking sequence. none of the 3' flanking sequences of tagged insertions involved in these events were located on chromosome r. the recombination events generating these elements must have resulted from inter-chromosomal recombination and presumably generated dicentric recombinant chromosomes whose resolution would have required chromosomal breakage.

zorro <dig> retrotransposition is temperature-regulated
as alluded to above, strains carrying the tagged zorro <dig> element did not give rise to ura3+ colonies at 37°c, but produced an abundance of ura3+ derivatives at lower temperatures. to analyse this phenomenon in more detail we measured the transposition rate at 22°, 27° and 37°. we did not observe any retrotransposition at 37°, whereas numerous events were observed at 27°, and the rate was increased about a further ten-fold at 22° , suggesting that some aspect of the zorro <dig> retrotransposition pathway is strongly affected by temperature. it is not yet known what this is, but possibilities include some temperature-sensitive aspect of enzyme activity or perhaps the involvement of some temperature-sensitive  rna secondary structure in the process. this fortuitous temperature-sensitivity of zorro <dig> retrotransposition provides a convenient means of regulating the process, i.e., retrotransposition can be inhibited by maintaining the cells at 37°c, then allowed to proceed by moving them to a lower temperature. it is interesting to note that a temperature-dependent affect on retrotransposition was also observed for the c. albicans tca <dig> retrotransposon  <cit> , although in this case retrotransposition was more frequent at higher temperatures. likewise, ty <dig> of s. cerevisiae is temperature-sensitive, with retrotransposition events most frequent at about 24°c and very rare at 37°c  <cit> .

zorro <dig> retrotransposition utilises its own proteins
we next asked whether zorro <dig> retrotransposition is dependent on the orfs of the cloned element or whether it is due to activation in trans by endogenous retroelements or cellular proteins. we made several mutant elements carrying specific alterations in the zorro <dig> sequence. one mutant, ppz3taΔpa, has an extensive deletion that extends from a pst i site at position  <dig> of the zorro <dig> sequence to a pst i site at position  <dig> and removes the last  <dig> bp of orf <dig>  the interorf region and the first  <dig> bp of orf <dig>  a second mutant, pz3bn <dig>  has an inframe stop codon introduced near the start of orf <dig>  downstream of the first conserved domains of the en-coding sequence. a third mutant, pz3bn <dig>  has a frameshift introduced into orf <dig> at the same site as the stop codon in pz3bn <dig> above. these mutant elements were transformed into c. albicans and the associated retrotransposition frequency was measured and compared with that of wild-type elements . cells carrying ppz3taΔpa did not give rise to any ura3+ cells. cells carrying pz3bn <dig> or pz3bn <dig> did produce ura3+ derivatives but at less than 5% the frequency of cells carrying wild-type elements. these results suggest that retrotransposition of a zorro <dig> element, for the most part, requires its orfs to be intact. one potential alternative explanation, however, is that the mutations in the orfs of these elements result in less stable rna molecules, and it is reduced rna levels, rather than an absence of appropriate proteins, that results in the reduced retrotransposition frequency. to test this we measured the zorro <dig> rna levels in cells carrying wild-type and mutant elements . cells carrying pz3bn <dig> or pz3bn <dig> were found to have, on average, higher zorro <dig> rna levels than cells with the wild-type element. the rna levels in cells with the internally deleted element were measured as somewhat lower than those of cells with the wild-type element, but this slight reduction is unlikely to account for the complete absence of retrotransposition in these cells. overall, these results show that most  of the retrotransposition that is observed for the tagged wild-type elements in this system is dependent upon the proteins produced by the tagged element. a low background rate of retrotransposition associated with some mutants might be due to the mutations being slightly leaky or a result of trans-activation by endogenous elements .

a the numbers of ura3+ colonies were counted after  <dig> days incubation at 22°c.

b no ura3+ colonies were ever observed with the parental strain, cai <dig>  under identical conditions.

c the number of independent transformants analysed is shown in parentheses.

analysis of specific mutants of zorro3
one of the main potential uses for a yeast tp retrotransposition assay is the study of the contribution of specific sequences to the retrotransposition process. to begin an analysis of the sequences important for zorro <dig> retrotransposition we made three more mutant elements. in the first additional mutant, pz3bn <dig>  the first atg codon in orf <dig> was changed to acg. this triplet is of particular interest as the means by which orf <dig> is translated in l <dig> and l1-like elements is not well understood. because orf <dig> is the second orf in a dicistronic transcript, its translation is unlikely to be initiated simply following cap-recognition and scanning. in the next mutant, pz3bn <dig>  an extremely a-rich sequence in the interorf region  was replaced with an asp 718i site . in the third, pz3bn <dig>  a missense mutation  was made in orf <dig> converting a highly conserved asn codon in the endonuclease coding region to an ala codon. a similar mutation at the homologous position of the human l <dig> element  apparently eliminates l <dig> en activity and reduces retrotransposition frequency to 1% of wild-type  <cit> .

the mutant elements were transformed into c. albicans and the retrotransposition frequency associated with each measured and compared to that of wild-type elements . the levels of zorro <dig> rna for each were also measured and were all found to be similar to cells bearing the wild-type construct .

a the relative retrotransposition frequency was calculated in the same way as for table  <dig>  but data was taken from only the particular transformants in which rna levels were also measured.

b zorro <dig> rna levels were measured as described in the text. the zorro <dig> rna levels in each rna sample were then normalized against the act <dig> rna levels in the same rna sample and averaged for each set of transformants containing the same plasmid construct.

for cells carrying pz3bn <dig>  the retrotransposition frequency was reduced to less than 5% of that of cells bearing wild-type elements, a similar level to that found with elements bearing stop codons or frameshifts within orf <dig>  this indicates that the first atg codon in orf <dig> is important for zorro <dig> retrotransposition .

the deletion of the a-rich sequence in the interorf region  reduces the retrotransposition frequency to about half that of wild-type elements , suggesting that this sequence is also involved in some way in retrotransposition, but that it is perhaps not as critical as the structure of orf <dig> 

like the orf <dig> nonsense, frameshift and atg mutations, the n17a missense mutation in the en coding region of orf <dig>  reduces the retrotransposition frequency to less than 5% of that of the wild-type element. this suggests that the zorro <dig> endonuclease is involved in the majority of the observed retrotransposition events.

discussion
here we have described a system for studying the lifecycle of a tp retrotransposon in a yeast. this is the first such system in a experimentally tractable microorganism. retrotransposed copies of the marked zorro <dig> element that the system uses resemble endogenous insertions suggesting that the natural retrotransposition pathway is being employed. retrotransposition is dependent on the element's own internal sequence, as the introduction of debilitating mutations greatly reduces the rate of, or eliminates, retrotransposition. retrotransposition occurs sufficiently frequently to allow the process to be studied by comparing the retrotransposition frequencies of wild-type elements and elements carrying specific mutations. this yeast system complements other currently available systems for studying tp retrotransposons, which involve the analysis of tagged elements in mammalian cells  <cit> . for instance, it is simpler to grow and experimentally manipulate yeast cells than cultured mammalian cells. certain experiments can be performed in yeast, such as comparing retrotransposition frequencies in multiple strains with different host genes deleted, that would currently be impractical, if not impossible, to perform in mammalian cells. in addition, the acquisition and interpretation of experimental data should be simpler in a yeast system due to the small size of yeast genomes, the low number of endogenous retrotransposon copies and the possibility than even this small number of endogenous insertions could be specifically deleted. while certain features of the l <dig> system and other tp retrotransposons will only be revealed by experiments performed in their natural hosts, this zorro <dig> assay should make a very useful addition to the currently available systems for studying general features of tp retrotransposition.

the use of this assay system has already uncovered some interesting aspects of zorro <dig> retrotransposition. for instance, we found that zorro <dig> appears to always integrate at poly-a sequences. this preference may represent an adaptation to provide a large number of potential insertion sites, as such sequences appear to be much more common in the c. albicans genome than would be expected by chance: in a random sample of assembly  <dig> contigs containing  <dig>  bp of genomic dna  we identified  <dig> poly-a or poly-t  sequences  <dig> or more bases in length. this  <dig> kb random sample of the genome contained  <dig> % a or t residues, so the number of 10-bp poly-a or poly-t stretches expected by chance can be estimated as about  <dig> . poly-a sequences  <dig> bases in length thus appear about  <dig> times more frequently than expected. assuming that the sample analysed is representative of the genome, we estimate that there are about  <dig> poly-a stretches  <dig> or more bases long in the haploid c. albicans genome. given this number of potential zorro <dig> insertion sites it is interesting that in our sample of  <dig> new insertions we identified three pairs of elements that had independently inserted at the same sites. this finding suggests that additional factors may be involved in target site selection for zorro <dig>  for example, proximity to rna polymerase ii promoter regions .

targeting of poly-a sequences may also be an integral part of the retrotransposition process for zorro3: for minus strand synthesis, the zorro <dig> endonuclease would cleave the strand complementary to the target poly-a sequence, i.e., a poly-t sequence. this poly-t 'flap' could then anneal to the poly-a tract at the 3' end of the zorro <dig> mrna and the 3' oh group of the t residue adjacent to the nick could be used as a primer for minus strand dna synthesis. for plus strand dna synthesis, the target poly-a tract exposed by synthesis of minus-strand dna onto the target's complementary poly-t tract, would anneal to the poly-t tract at the 3' end of the zorro <dig> minus-strand dna  and a 3' oh group exposed by nicking within the target poly-a sequence could be used to prime plus-strand dna synthesis. thus, annealing between sequences at the target and the 5' and 3' ends of the zorro <dig> element could assist in directing the tp reverse transcription reactions to the correct 5' and 3' ends, and thus promote the formation of full-length  progeny elements. interestingly, the apparent target preference for zorro <dig> is similar to that for l <dig>  <cit> , which preferentially integrates at runs of a residues downstream of t residues . zorro <dig> and l <dig> elements may have a similar mechanism for attaching the 3' end of the transcript to the genomic target to initiate the tp reverse transcription reaction.

we also observed a bias against zorro <dig> insertions within orfs  and an apparent bias for zorro <dig> insertions a short distance  upstream of orfs, with  <dig> out of  <dig> insertions being within  <dig> bp of the start of an orf and  <dig> out of  <dig> within  <dig> bp. this may simply reflect the location of poly-a sequences in the genome, or it may correspond to regions with appropriate chromatin structure for endonuclease binding, or it may be a specific adaptation to direct integration to sites where the element is likely to be expressed , while minimising disruption to the host genome.

some interesting aspects of zorro <dig> retrotransposition were also uncovered by the study of elements carrying specific mutations. for example, the finding that zorro <dig> elements with nonsense or frameshift mutations in orf <dig> can still give rise to retrotransposition events at a detectable frequency suggests either that a low level of nonsense suppression or frameshifting is occurring to allow the occasional translation of orf <dig>  or, perhaps more likely, that a lack of orf <dig> translation can be complemented in trans at a low frequency by orf <dig> protein produced by endogenous zorro <dig> insertions. in support of this possibility, previous work has shown that the endogenous zorro <dig> elements are expressed at a readily detectable level  <cit>  and so may be capable of supplying trans-acting proteins. if trans-activation is occurring then it is interesting to consider why rna derived from the zorro <dig> element carrying the large internal deletion is apparently unable to be trans-complemented. one possible explanation is that the extensive deletion in this mutant has removed a sequence which is strictly cis-acting. the most obvious difference in the mutations borne by these elements is that in the internal deletion mutant both orf <dig> and orf <dig> are likely inactivated, whereas only orf <dig> is inactivated in the other two. it may be that the product of orf <dig> can act in trans at some frequency but the product of orf <dig> is strictly cis-acting.

the results for the mutant in which the first atg codon in orf <dig> is changed to acg, which show that retrotransposition is reduced to a similar level as that for the orf <dig> nonsense and frameshift mutants, suggest that this atg codon is required for proper orf <dig> translation. this is of particular interest as the mechanism by which orf <dig> is translated in zorro <dig> and other tp elements with non-overlapping orfs, such as mammalian l <dig>  is not known at present, although mechanisms such as internal initiation or reinitiation have been suggested  <cit> . the results for zorro <dig> appear to contrast with those from mammalian l <dig> elements in that whereas changing the first atg of orf <dig> in l <dig> to a nonsense codon severely reduced the frequency of retrotransposition, changing it to any other sense codon still allowed for high levels of retrotransposition  <cit> .

the zorro <dig> retrotransposition assay system has a number of features which could be improved. in particular, the variability in retrotransposition frequency seen among independent transformants with identical constructs is quite high, and appears to be higher than might be expected simply due to stochastic variation. the source of the variability is currently uncertain, but could arise due to the transforming plasmids integrating into the genome in different copy numbers resulting in different expression levels and therefore different retrotransposition frequencies. if this is the case then the variability might be reduced by expressing the element from an episomal  vector. unfortunately, the currently available episomal vectors for c. albicans  <cit>  replicate at low copy numbers, are very unstable, and are prone to randomly integrating into the host genome at a high frequency anyway. these would probably add to the variation rather than reduce it. another feature of the current assay that might be improved is the zorro <dig> retrotransposition frequency, which is quite low in comparison to that of l <dig> – about  <dig>  events per million cells for wild-type zorro <dig> compared to as many as  <dig> or more per million cells for wild-type l1s  <cit>  . future attempts to optimise the zorro <dig> system may result in increased retrotransposition frequencies.

one possible way of improving the zorro <dig> system would be to transfer it to s. cerevisiae. however, the successful expression of c. albicans genes in s. cerevisiae is often not a trivial matter, due to the nonstandard genetic code used by c. albicans , which may require that all such codons in a c. albicans gene are converted to other serine codons prior to expression in s. cerevisiae. if, however, the zorro <dig> system could be successsfully transferred to s. cerevisiae, then this would allow the many genetic tools developed for this species to be employed in the analysis of the retrotransposon. for instance, the contribution of various host genes to the retrotransposition process could be studied by comparing the frequency of retrotransposition in each strain of the s. cerevisiae knock-out collection  <cit> . the potential of the zorro <dig> system to function in s. cerevisiae is the subject of ongoing research.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a yeast model system for studying target-primed retrotransposition. similar to the way in which the study of specific yeast ltr retrotransposons, such as ty <dig> and ty <dig>  has made an enormously valuable contribution to our general understanding of ltr elements, we hope that this yeast zorro <dig> system will make a valuable contribution to our general understanding of target-primed retrotransposons.
