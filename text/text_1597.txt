BACKGROUND
the orphan carrier slc10a <dig> belongs to the solute carrier family slc <dig>  whose founding members are the na+/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide ntcp  and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter asbt   <cit> . these carriers maintain the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by sodium-dependent bile acid reabsorption in the gut via asbt and sodium-dependent bile acid transport into hepatocytes via ntcp  <cit> . a further member of this carrier family, the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter soat , is expressed in spermatocytes in man and mouse and has transport activity for sulfo-conjugated steroid hormones . the other members of this carrier family, slc10a <dig>  slc10a <dig>  slc10a <dig>  and slc10a <dig>  have been characterized at the molecular and expression level, but still remain orphan carriers .

the slc10a <dig> transcript was first cloned from rat in our group in  <dig> and showed predominant expression in the central nervous system in man, rat, and mouse  <cit> . further expression analyses on the protein level localized slc10a <dig> to cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system as well as to mast cells . in contrast to ntcp, asbt, and soat, the slc10a <dig> protein is not directed to the plasma membrane, but typically showed a vesicular expression pattern in neuronal cells, mast cells, and even in transiently or stably transfected cells lines . based on this expression pattern, it was assumed that slc10a <dig> may represent a novel vesicular carrier for any kind of neurotransmitter or neuromodulator . more recently, in a series of very elegant experiments on slc10a <dig> knockout mice it was shown by the kullander group that these mice are hypersensitive to the psychostimulants amphetamine and tranylcypromine, and have an altered response to cholinergic stimuli at the neuromuscular junction and in the central cholinergic system, suggesting that slc10a <dig> may contribute to the vesicular storage or release of neurotransmitters . therefore, in the present study, we performed systematic transport screenings for slc10a <dig> in transfected neuronal and hek <dig> cell lines as well as in xenopus laevis oocytes and also aimed to identify the vesicular sorting domain of the slc10a <dig> protein. although we have not identified a transported substrate for slc10a <dig> to date, recent descriptions of taurocholic acid and lithocholic acid transport by a thrombin-modified variant of slc10a <dig>  <cit>  encouraged us to present our data to provide a broader basis for further slc10a <dig> transport studies.

RESULTS
endogenous expression of slc10a <dig> in neuronal cell lines
the primary goal of the present study was to identify a transported substrate for the orphan carrier slc10a <dig> with an in vitro approach. as the endogenous expression of slc10a <dig> is exclusively directed to neuronal cells and mast cells  <cit> , neuronal cell cultures were thought to be the most appropriate for this purpose. therefore, we analyzed slc10a <dig> expression in the human neuroblastoma cell line sh-sy5y as well as in the mouse cell line cad  with different slc10a4-directed antibodies.

sh-sy5y cells showed a typical neuroblast-like appearance with small, round cell bodies and occasional short extensions. under incubation with retinoic acid  and the neurotropic factors tumor growth factor beta  and bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> , the cells stopped proliferation and developed neurite-like long extensions, as described previously  <cit> . under both conditions, slc10a <dig> showed a clear vesicle-like expression pattern in the sh-sy5y cells and was detectable even along the long neurite-like outgrowths, indicating sorting of the slc10a <dig> protein to the synaptic direction of the differentiated sh-sy5y cells . at the rna level, slc10a <dig> showed an overall higher expression in the sh-sy5y cells compared with vesicular acetylcholine transporter  and vesicular monoamine transporter  <dig>  , but incubation with tgf-β1 + ra or bmp-2 + ra did not significantly affect the slc10a <dig> mrna expression levels, indicating that slc10a <dig> expression is not regulated by the ra, bmp- <dig>  or tgf-β <dig> triggered signaling cascades . although transient transfection of slc10a <dig> into sh-sy5y revealed an identical expression pattern compared with the endogenous expression, as shown for an slc10a4-rfp construct in figure 1c, the transfection rate of these cells could not be enhanced above 20% by different transfection methods , meaning that sh-sy5y cells overexpressing slc10a <dig> vs. non-transfected sh-sy5y cells could not be used for transport studies. for the same reason, down-regulation of slc10a <dig> expression by transfection of slc10a <dig> sirna prior to transport experiments was also not considered.figure  <dig> expression and subcellular localization of slc10a <dig> in sh-sy5y and cad cells. a relative slc10a <dig> gene expression in sh-sy5y cells after differentiation with tgf-ß <dig> + ra or bmp-2 + ra. values represent mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. b immunofluorescence analysis of the subcellular expression of the slc10a <dig> protein in sh-sy5y cells. cells were either untreated , or were differentiated with tgf-ß1 + ra or bmp-2 + ra over 4 days prior to immunolabeling. the slc10a <dig> protein was detected with the anti-slc10a <dig>  <dig> c antibody  and the cy3-labelled anti-rabbit secondary antibody  and nuclei were stained with dapi . in all cases, the slc10a <dig> protein showed a vesicle-like expression pattern within the perikarya and along the neurite-like cellular protrusions. c even when a fluorescence-tagged slc10a4-rfp construct was transiently transfected into sh-sy5y cells, the slc10a4-rfp protein showed a clear vesicular sorting pattern. d relative slc10a <dig> gene expression analysis in differentiated  and undifferentiated  cad cells. the values represent mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. e endogenous expression of the slc10a <dig> protein in cad cells, cultivated in fcs containing medium  or fcs-free medium . the slc10a <dig> protein was detected with the anti-slc10a <dig>  <dig> c antibody  and the cy3-labelled secondary antibody . for control, the primary anti-slc10a <dig> antibody was omitted  or the antibody was pre-incubated with the immunizing peptide . f immunofluorescence detection of the slc10a <dig> protein was performed with different slc10a4-directed antibodies : self-generated polyclonal rabbit anti-slc10a <dig>  <dig> c antibody, rabbit anti-slc10a <dig> sigma prestige antibody, rabbit anti-slc10a <dig> abnova antibody, and rabbit anti-slc10a <dig> abgent antibody. membrane protein enriched fractions of the cad cells were also subjected to western blot analysis with the same antibodies and revealed specific bands for the slc10a <dig> protein at an apparent molecular weight of 30–32 kda.



similar to the sh-sy5y cells, the slc10a <dig> protein was detected in vesicular structures in mouse cad cells. these cells were differentiated to a neuronal phenotype by serum depletion, as previously reported  <cit> . as shown in figure 1e, under these conditions, long neurite-like extensions were formed which were highly immunoreactive for the anti-slc10a <dig> antibody. however, even in these cells, rna expression of slc10a <dig> was not significantly affected by neuronal differentiation . although cad cells could easily be transfected with different slc10a <dig> constructs with transfection rates above 80%, these cells significantly detached after the transfection procedure and then could not be further subjected to standard transport assays. therefore, overexpression of slc10a <dig> or down-expression by rnai transfection of these cells was not practicable for transport screening assays.

localization of the slc10a <dig> protein in the central and peripheral nervous system of the rat, as well as in rat pc <dig> cells  <cit> , human sh-sy5y cells, and mouse cad cells , was performed by us with a self-generated polyclonal rabbit antibody— <dig> c—directed against the amino acid residues 422– <dig>  of the deduced rat slc10a <dig> protein sequence . in order to further verify slc10a <dig> expression in neuronal cell cultures with different antibodies, we screened mouse cad cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis, and found by all of the used antibodies—directed against the 324– <dig> amino acids of the c-terminus of human slc10a <dig> protein , the 1– <dig> amino acids of the n-terminus of mouse and rat slc10a <dig> protein , and the 377– <dig> amino acids of the c-terminus of the human slc10a <dig> protein —a clear vesicle-like expression pattern. the mouse slc10a <dig> protein consistently showed an apparent molecular weight of 30–32 kda in the western blot . this is below the calculated molecular weight of 47 kda, which has been reported for other members of the slc <dig> carrier family as well  <cit> .

in vitro transport studies on slc10a <dig> with candidate substrates
as these neuronal cell lines were difficult to handle for standard transport experiments, we decided to use transfected human embryonic kidney   <dig> cells as well as slc10a <dig> crna injected x. laevis oocytes, which are both well-established in vitro cell models for transport measurements  <cit> . we previously reported that, apart from its predominant intracellular expression, the slc10a <dig> protein can to a lower extent also be detected in the plasma membrane of transfected hek <dig> cells  <cit> . therefore, we first used hek <dig> cells transiently transfected with the human slc10a <dig> construct for classical uptake measurement in intact cells. as positive controls, the plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters dopamine transporter , choline transporter , and serotonin transporter  were also transfected, and empty-vector transfected cells served as negative controls. whereas dat showed a significant nomifensine-sensitive and sodium-dependent uptake of dopamine, slc10a4-transfected hek <dig> cells tended to accumulate more dopamine compared with the control, but without reaching a level of significance . slc10a <dig> showed no transport activity for norepinephrine, serotonin and choline at all, whereas dat, sert and cht <dig> significantly transported their substrates in a sodium-dependent manner.figure  <dig> transport measurements in transiently transfected hek <dig> cells. hek <dig> cells were transiently transfected with the indicated carriers slc10a <dig>  dat, cht <dig>  or sert, respectively. the uptake of 5 µm dopamine, 5 µm norepinephrine, 5 µm choline, or 5 µm serotonin was measured over the given time periods in the presence and absence of na+ . transport via dat, cht <dig>  and sert was blocked by the specific inhibitors nomifensine , hemicholinium- <dig> , and citalopram , respectively. values represent mean ± sd of representative experiments, each with quadruplicate determinations . *significantly different from control with p <  <dig> . #significantly different from positive uptake, p <  <dig> .



in our previous study, we reported co-expression of the slc10a <dig> protein with vmat <dig> in synaptic vesicles of rat brain preparations  <cit> , so we next intended to analyze the slc10a <dig> transport in direct comparison with vmat <dig>  in this approach, we used hek <dig> cells stably transfected with human slc10a <dig> or human vmat <dig>  which were permeabilized with digitonin in order to facilitate access of the transport substrate to the site of carrier expression in intracellular vesicular structures, as described before  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  vmat <dig> showed significant transport activity for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine which was dependent on the presence of adenosine triphosphate  in the transport buffer as well as sensitive to tetrabenazin  and carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazon . however, in contrast, slc10a <dig> showed no transport activity for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine at all in this vesicular transport assay. we also could not demonstrate a transport of acetylcholine, neither for slc10a <dig> nor for vacht in permeabilized hek <dig> cell lines transfected with the respective construct .figure  <dig> transport measurements in digitonin permeabilized slc10a4-hek <dig> and vmat2-hek <dig> cells. prior to transport measurements, stably transfected human slc10a4-hek <dig> cells and human vmat2-hek <dig> cells were pre-incubated with 15 µm digitonin for 10 min for permeabilization. then the uptake of 400 nm serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine was measured over 10 min in the presence and absence of 5 mm atp in the transport buffer. in addition to atp, 2 µm of the potent vmat <dig> inhibitor tetrabenazine  or 5 µm of the proton ionophore carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazon  were added to the transport buffer as indicated. after 10 min, the cells were washed with ice-cold pbs, lysed, and subjected to scintillation counting. the values represent mean ± sd of one representative experiment  or two independent experiments . *significantly different from control with p <  <dig> . #significantly different from positive uptake, p <  <dig> .



in previous studies at our institute we learned that the transport rates for a particular carrier may be higher in the x. laevis oocytes expression system compared with transfected cell cultures. furthermore, we demonstrated in a previous study that at least the rat slc10a <dig> protein is expressed at the plasma membrane of x. laevis oocytes  <cit> . therefore, we injected slc10a <dig> crna in x. laevis oocytes and screened for transport activity with a series of neurotransmitters and further slc10a <dig> candidate substrates. for these experiments, water-injected oocytes served as negative control and, if appropriate, oocytes injected with crna coding for sert, dat, ntcp, or mouse organic cation transporter  <dig>  were used as positive controls. as shown in figure  <dig>  sert, dat, and oct <dig> showed significant transport activity for serotonin, dopamine, and histamine, respectively, but slc10a <dig> crna injected oocytes were not different from the control. furthermore, the neurosteroids pregnenolone sulfate  and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate  as well as the bile acid taurocholic acid, were not transported by slc10a <dig> in this transport assay, although ntcp showed significant transport activity for all of them. apart from these candidate substrates, slc10a <dig> also showed no transport activity for aspartate, acetate, choline, gamma-aminobutyric acid , norepinephrine, glutamate, acetylcholine, estrone-3-sulfate , lithocholic acid, and atp in the x. laevis oocytes model .figure  <dig> transport measurements in xenopus laevis oocytes. xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with crna coding for human slc10a <dig>  sert, dat, or ntcp as well as mouse oct <dig>  uptake of serotonin, histamine, pregs, dopamine, dheas, or taurocholic acid, each at 1 µm, was measured over a time period of 10–60 min as indicated in the presence of sodium chloride in the transport buffer. sert, oct <dig>  and dat served as controls for the transport of serotonin, histamine, and dopamine, respectively. ntcp was the reference carrier for pregs, dheas and taurocholic acid. afterwards, the oocytes were washed with ice-cold transport buffer, lysed and subjected to scintillation counting. the values represent mean ± sd of one representative experiment with n =  <dig> oocytes each. *significantly different from control with p <  <dig> .

very recently, it was reported that the n-terminal domain of the slc10a <dig> protein could be cleaved by thrombin treatment and thereby transport activity for taurocholic acid and lithocholic acid may be activated  <cit> . although these data were obtained in a neuronal cell culture of te <dig> cells, in the present study, we intended to reproduce these data on the isolated over-expressed slc10a <dig> protein and used hek <dig> cells stably transfected with slc10a <dig> as well as with ntcp for the control. both, slc10a4-hek <dig> and ntcp-hek <dig> cell lines were treated with  <dig> u/200 µl of thrombin for 3 h prior to transport measurements with dheas, taurocholic acid, pregs, and lithocholic acid. as expected, ntcp showed significant transport activity for dheas, taurocholic acid and pregs, and was not affected by thrombin treatment. in contrast, slc10a <dig> did not transport any of these compounds, even after pre-treatment with thrombin . no transport activity could be observed for lithocholic acid at all, neither in ntcp nor in the slc10a4-expressing hek <dig> cells. therefore, transport activity of slc10a <dig> could not be activated by thrombin treatment in the cell model used.figure  <dig> transport measurements in stably transfected slc10a4-hek <dig> and ntcp-hek <dig> cells after thrombin treatment. for the transport measurements, one part of the cells was pre-incubated with  <dig> u/200 µl thrombin over 3 h , before the uptake of dheas, taurocholic acid, pregs, or lithocholic acid  was measured over a time period of 10 min at 37°c. the cells were washed with ice-cold pbs, lysed, and subjected to scintillation counting. the values represent mean ± sd of two independent experiments each with triplicate determinations. *significantly different from control with p <  <dig> ; n.s. not significantly different.



localization of the vesicular sorting domain in the c-terminus of slc10a4
a further aim of the present study was to localize the particular domain of slc10a <dig> that is responsible for the vesicular sorting of this protein. this question was of particular interest, as mutation of this domain might redirect the slc10a <dig> protein to the plasma membrane, which would facilitate further substrate screening. as within the slc <dig> carrier family, ntcp, which is expressed at the plasma membrane, is the most related carrier to slc10a <dig>  we generated several slc10a4/ntcp chimeric constructs in which the c-terminal and n-terminal domains were interchanged between both carriers . furthermore, we generated a 75Δslc10a <dig> mutant which was truncated by the first 75 n-terminal amino acids. all constructs were transfected in neuronal cad cells as well as in hek <dig> cells and used for immunofluorescence analysis of protein localization  as well as for transport experiments with slc10a <dig> candidate substrates . as shown in figure 6b, ntcp showed clear plasma membrane localization in cad cells, whereas slc10a <dig> showed expression in intracellular vesicles. interestingly, both chimeras bearing the c-terminus of ntcp  were detected at the plasma membrane, whereas all chimeric proteins with the c-terminus of slc10a <dig>  were detected in intracellular vesicles. this sorting pattern was basically the same when these constructs were transfected and analyzed in hek <dig> cells . this indicates that the c-termini of ntcp and slc10a <dig> are dominant for the sorting to the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, respectively. in contrast, truncation of the slc10a4 n-terminus  as well as transfer of the slc10a4 n-terminus into the ntcp  did not affect the sorting of slc10a <dig> and ntcp, respectively, indicating that the c-terminus, but not the n-terminus of the slc10a <dig> protein is relevant for the protein sorting. apart from localizing the sorting domains in the slc10a <dig> protein, several of the constructs were of particular interest for transport experiments.  when the n-terminal domain of slc10a <dig>  which was previously supposed to hinder substrate binding to the slc10a <dig> carrier protein  <cit> , were transferred to the ntcp in order to produce a ntslc10a4-ntcp elongated chimera, the transport function for taurocholic acid remained completely intact compared with wild-type ntcp .  furthermore, activation of the slc10a4-mediated taurocholic acid transport by thrombin cleavage of the n-terminus was supposed  <cit> . however, for the n-terminally truncated 75Δslc10a <dig> protein, as well as for the ntntcp-slc10a4-ctntcp chimera, still no transport activity for taurocholic acid could be observed.  just by replacing the slc10a <dig> c-terminal  <dig> amino acids by the corresponding c-terminus of ntcp in the slc10a4-ctntcp and ntntcp-slc10a4-ctntcp chimera, the slc10a <dig> protein was directed to the plasma membrane. therefore, these chimeras represent an interesting tool for slc10a <dig> substrate screening. as the cad cells detached after transfection of the respective constructs when they were further processed for the routine transport assay, the radiolabelled candidate substrates were added directly into the cell culture medium and cell associated radioactivity was analyzed. however, neither slc10a4-ctntcp nor ntntcp-slc10a4-ctntcp showed transport activity so far for taurocholic acid and serotonin  as well as for dheas, pregs, e-3-s, dopamine, glutamate, histamine, acetylcholine, and choline .figure  <dig> localization and transport function of slc10a4/ntcp chimeras in cad cells. a the shown slc10a4/ntcp chimeric constructs were used. all chimeras were generated based on the full length sequences of slc10a <dig>  and ntcp , both with c-terminal v5-tag. potential glycosylation sites were marked by “y”. b all constructs were transiently transfected in cad cells and cellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using rabbit anti-v <dig> antibody and donkey cy3-labelled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. nuclei were stained with dapi. whereas slc10a <dig> showed a clear vesicle-like expression pattern, the immunofluorescence signals for ntcp, ntslc10a4-ntcp, slc10a4-ctntcp, and ntntcp-slc10a4-ctntcp were clearly directed to the plasma membrane. when the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids were deleted in slc10a <dig>  the 75Δslc10a <dig> protein retained its vesicle-like intracellular expression comparable with full-length slc10a <dig>  c the slc10a4/ntcp chimeras were also used for transport studies after transient transfection into cad cells with taurocholic acid and serotonin, each at 5 µm. these measurements were performed by incubating the cells for 60 min at 37°c in 250 µl cell medium with 50 µl sodium transport buffer containing the radiolabeled and non-radiolabeled compounds. ntcp and sert were used as a positive control, and empty-vector transfected cells served as the negative control. after the uptake phase, cells were washed with ice-cold pbs, lysed, and subjected to scintillation counting. data represent mean ± sd of representative experiments each with

discussion
slc10a <dig> is a member of the slc <dig> carrier family commonly referred to as the “family of sodium-dependent bile acid transporters”. the rat slc10a <dig> transcript was first cloned in our group in  <dig>   <cit>  and the human slc10a <dig> sequence was published in  <dig>  <cit> . the slc10a <dig> protein consists of  <dig> amino acids in man, rat, and mouse, and shows a close phylogenetic relationship to the sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ntcp. however, whereas ntcp is specifically expressed at the sinusoidal plasma membrane of hepatocytes  <cit> , the slc10a <dig> protein was localized in cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in pheochromocytoma pc <dig> cells and mast cells . based on its genetic classification, slc10a <dig> first was suggested to be a novel carrier for already established substrates of the slc <dig> carrier family, including bile acids and sulfo-conjugated steroid hormones  <cit> . however, based on its expression pattern, it seems more likely that slc10a <dig> plays a role for the vesicular storage or exocytosis of any kind of neurotransmitter or mediator in neurons and mast cells  <cit> . in previous experiments, the neurosteroids pregs and dheas were already considered to be particularly promising candidate substrates. these neurosteroids can modulate several postsynaptic receptor systems and even interfere with the release of multiple neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin . however, until now, all transport measurements performed with e-3-s, dheas, and pregs have so far failed to show transport function for slc10a <dig>  <cit>  . however, a more systematic transport screening also including classical neurotransmitters as candidate substrates has not yet been performed. therefore, in the present study, we aimed to screen for slc10a <dig> transport function with different transport assays, including transport in intact hek <dig> cells and neuronal cad cells, permeabilized hek <dig> cells and x. laevis oocytes. overall, no transport activity for slc10a <dig> was found for taurocholic acid, lithocholic acid, dheas, pregs, e-3-s, acetylcholine, choline, acetate, glutamate, aspartate, gaba, atp, serotonin, histamine, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the respective transport assay. although we used different kinds of transport assays and cell models, it might be the case that slc10a <dig> has transport function for one of the mentioned compounds anyway. in hek <dig> cells and x. laevis oocytes, an additional factor might have been missed that is only present in neuronal cells. however, overexpression of the slc10a <dig> protein or permeabilization of the cells prior to transport experiments was not practicable in neuronal cell lines as the cells either showed low transfection rates  or promptly detached when the incubation medium was repeatedly changed . furthermore, all transport assays performed in slc10a4-transfected cad cells also failed to show transport activity for slc10a <dig>  nevertheless, further investigations on the slc10a <dig> transport function should focus on vesicle preparations from slc10a4-deleted neuronal cell cultures or may use liposomal reconstitution of the slc10a <dig> protein.

very recently, it was suggested by abe et al.  <cit>  that slc10a <dig> may represent a protease-activated transporter for the bile acids taurocholic acid and lithocholic acid. they used the human medulloblastoma cell line te <dig> in which they localized the slc10a <dig> protein by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis with a commercial anti-slc10a <dig> antibody and showed that pre-incubation of the cells with 1u/200 µl of thrombin for 3 h increased the cellular uptake of taurocholic acid and lithocholic acid  <cit> . however, appropriate controls demonstrating specificity of the antibody were not provided and the authors failed to seriously show saturable transport kinetics for this uptake. furthermore, bioinformatics analysis  indicates that the mouse and rat slc10a <dig> proteins can be cleaved by thrombin at amino acid position  <dig>  but not the human slc10a <dig> protein. nevertheless, in the present study, these experiments were repeated by using hek <dig> cells overexpressing slc10a <dig>  providing a better controllable system, but did not show any transport activity of slc10a <dig> for taurocholic acid after treatment with thrombin. due to these negative data and based on the bioinformatics prediction we did not further analyze whether the human slc10a <dig> protein can really be cleaved by thrombin in our experimental setup. furthermore, when the large n-terminus of slc10a <dig> was deleted by mutagenesis in the ntntcp-slc10a4-ctntcp and 75Δslc10a <dig> constructs, no transport activity for taurocholic acid was detected. this is of particular interest, because it was suggested by abe et al.  <cit>  that the n-terminal domain of slc10a <dig> might hinder substrate binding to the protein. this suggestion can not be supported by data from the present study. it is already known that thrombin starting from  <dig> u/200 µl has a dose-dependent effect on cell viability of neuronal cell cultures  <cit> . furthermore, it was reported that lithocholic acid selectively kills neuroblastoma cells by triggering the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic death pathways via binding to the surface  <cit> . therefore, it cannot be excluded that the suggested uptake of taurocholic acid and lithocholic acid may just have resulted from the combined surface effects of the bile acids and thrombin, but not from carrier-mediated uptake into the cells via a thrombin-modified slc10a <dig> variant.

during the completion of this study, the kullander group published a series of very elegant experiments on slc10a <dig> knockout mice, which provide further intriguing indications of the molecular transport function of slc10a <dig>  in the first study by zelano et al.  <cit> , they analyzed whether the absence of slc10a <dig> may have an impact on the function of the central cholinergic system. injection of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpin induced status epilepticus earlier and more often in the slc10a <dig> knockout mice compared with the wild type mice, suggesting that slc10a <dig> may suppress epileptiform activity. they concluded that absence of the slc10a <dig> protein results in cholinergic hypersensitivity of the knockout mice  <cit> . in a second study by patra et al.  <cit> , the role of slc10a <dig> on the structure and function of the neuromuscular junction was analyzed. although there were no abnormalities detectable at the macrostructure level, the slc10a <dig> knockout mice showed misshapen neuro-muscular junctions with an increased number of isolated acetylcholine receptor clusters and a decreased number of endplate branches. nevertheless, the knockout mice had normal motor behavior. electrophysiological measurements on nerve-muscle preparations then showed that the slc10a <dig> knockout mice had decreased spontaneous endplate potential amplitudes, which could be explained by lower acetylcholine release at the endplates without nerve stimulation. on the other hand, after repeated stimulation, the slc10a <dig> knockout mice revealed an enlarged pool of readily releasable vesicles at the neuro-muscular junction. however, for the interpretation of these data, it has to be considered that the knockout mice may have altered gene-expression in order to compensate for the loss of slc10a <dig>  as shown by an up-regulation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits alpha <dig> and delta in the slc10a <dig> knockout mice. the authors came to the conclusion that the loss of slc10a <dig> may result in reduced vesicular filling with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction  <cit> . in a further study by larhammar et al.  <cit> , the slc10a <dig> knockout mice were not different from their wild-type littermates in a series of behavior tests, but showed a hypoactive phenotype. furthermore, the slc10a <dig> knockout mice were hypersensitive to the psychostimulants amphetamine and tranylcypromine. in the central nervous system, the slc10a <dig> knockout mice had reduced levels of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and choline. although no evidence for the direct transport of these neurotransmitters by slc10a <dig> has been provided, synaptic vesicles from transgenic mice overexpressing the slc10a <dig> protein showed an increased uptake of dopamine, which was probably due to higher synaptic vesicle acidification. based on these data, the authors speculate that slc10a <dig> may transport any hitherto unknown organic anion compound, which would allow the vesicular accumulation of higher amounts of protons, which then would increase the vesicular storage of neurotransmitters  <cit> . this conclusion is in agreement with data from the present study, in which slc10a <dig> showed no transport activity for a series of neurotransmitters. however, even suggested organic anion modulators such as atp or dheas were not transported by slc10a <dig>  meaning that the function of slc10a <dig> as solute carrier is still a matter of speculation.

based on their findings, the kullander group suggested renaming slc10a <dig> as “vesicular aminergic-associated transporter” . however, as the naming of the carriers of the slc <dig> carrier family until now has only been based on their molecular transport function, i.e. na+/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide ntcp , apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter asbt , and sodium-dependent organic anion transporter soat , we strongly suggest not renaming slc10a <dig> before its molecular transport function has been elucidated.

the outstanding role of slc10a <dig> within the slc <dig> family is not only based on its inability to transport bile acids or steroid sulfates. in contrast to ntcp, asbt and soat, which all are sorted to the plasma membrane, slc10a <dig> has a typical intracellular vesicle-like expression pattern in neurons, mast cells and neuronal cell lines. this specific expression pattern of slc10a <dig> was also observed in the present study in untreated and differentiated cad and sh-sy5y cells. to more closely analyze the sorting domains of slc10a <dig>  a series of ntcp/slc10a <dig> chimeras were generated and analyzed in hek <dig> and cad cells. these experiments clearly showed that the cytoplasmic c-terminus of slc10a <dig> must contain dominant signals for its vesicular sorting. previous studies with rat ntcp demonstrated that the tyrosine-based sorting motifs yxxØ within its c-terminus  are involved in membrane delivery  <cit> . although the c-terminus of slc10a <dig> also contains these potential tyrosine-based sorting motifs , slc10a <dig> is obviously not directed to the plasma membrane. in the same way, all chimeric constructs with the c-terminus of slc10a <dig>  showed a vesicular expression pattern and failed to transport typical ntcp substrates such as taurocholic acid and dheas. in contrast, both chimeras bearing the c-terminus of ntcp  were detected at the plasma membrane. further mutagenesis experiments now have to localize the vesicular sorting motifs of slc10a <dig> at the amino acid level.

CONCLUSIONS
slc10a <dig> is expressed in vesicular structures not only in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system, but also in neuronal cell lines such as sh-sy5y and cad. although different kinds of assays were applied to screen for a transport function, slc10a <dig> failed to show transport activity for dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, histamine, acetylcholine, choline, acetate, aspartate, glutamate, gaba, pregs, dheas, e-3-s, and atp, indicating that slc10a <dig> does not seem to be a typical neurotransmitter transporter. when the c-terminus of slc10a <dig> was replaced by the homologous sequence of ntcp, the slc10a4-ctntcp chimera revealed clear plasma membrane expression in cad and hek <dig> cells. vice versa, the c-terminus of slc10a <dig> directed ntcp to intracellular vesicles, indicating that the sorting motifs of both carriers seem to be localized in the c-terminus. further slc10a <dig> transport studies should involve vesicle preparations from slc10a4-deleted neuronal cell cultures or may use liposomal reconstitution of the slc10a <dig> protein. until then, the functional properties of the slc10a <dig> orphan carrier protein still remain unknown.
