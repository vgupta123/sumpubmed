BACKGROUND
streptomycetes are gram-positive soil bacteria that display a complex morphological and metabolic differentiation. streptomyces develop branched hyphae that expand by tip extension to form a vegetative mycelium meshwork. in response to as yet unidentified signals and to nutritient depletion, aerial branches emerge from the surface of colonies and may produce spores. as the aerial mycelium develops, streptomyces colonies produce diverse secondary metabolites and synthesise antibiotics  <cit> . this differentiation cycle can be reproduced in laboratory conditions by growing streptomyces cells on solid media. most streptomyces species do not form aerial mycelium or spores when in liquid media , and antibiotic production occurs in submerged cultures  <cit> .

adpa, also known as bldh, has been identified as a conserved major transcriptional regulator involved in the formation of aerial mycelia in various streptomyces species  <cit> . adpa is a member of the family of arac/xyls regulator proteins that contain a c-terminal domain with two helix-turn-helix dna-binding motifs; these features are strictly conserved in all streptomyces adpas in the strepdb database  <cit> . the n-terminal domain of adpa is responsible for its dimerization and regulation  <cit> . protein/dna interaction experiments identified the following consensus adpa-binding site in s. griseus: 5′-tggcsngwwy-3′   <cit> .

adpa was discovered and has mostly been studied in s. griseus, in which it was first shown to activate expression of about thirty genes directly. they include genes encoding secreted proteins , a sigma factor , a subtilisin inhibitor , ssga which is essential for spore septum formation and the amfr transcriptional regulator involved in production of amfs , a small hydrophobic peptide involved in the emergence of aerial hyphae  <cit> . adpa also plays a role in secondary metabolism and directly activates streptomycin biosynthesis  <cit> .

proteomic, transcriptomic and chip-sequencing analyses revealed that, in fact, several hundred genes are under the control of s. griseus adpa and that adpa acts as transcriptional activator as well as repressor  <cit> . in s. coelicolor, few genes have been identified as being directly regulated by adpa: sti <dig> , ramr , clpp <dig>   <cit>  and wbla   <cit> .

the regulation of adpa gene expression is complex and various mechanisms have been described  <cit> . adpa represses its own gene expression in s. griseus <cit>  whereas it activates its own transcription in s. coelicolor <cit> . in several streptomyces species, the binding of γ-butyrolactones to a γ-butyrolactone receptor represses the adpa promoter  <cit> . in s. coelicolor, bldd represses adpa expression  <cit> . at the translational level, a feedback-control loop regulates levels of adpa and absb  in s. coelicolor <cit> . a positive feedback loop between adpa and blda, the only trna able to read the uua codon present in all adpa mrna, has been demonstrated in s. griseus <cit> . in s. coelicolor, adpa expression is constant during growth in liquid media  <cit>  whereas on solid media, adpa is strongly expressed before aerial hyphae formation and adpa is most abundant during the early aerial mycelium stage  <cit> .

even though adpa plays a major role in development of streptomyces spp., little is known about the pathways it controls in s. lividans, a species closely related to s. coelicolor and whose genome has recently been sequenced  <cit> . we have recently shown that in s. lividans adpa directly controls sti <dig> and the clpp1clpp <dig> operon, encoding important factors for streptomyces differentiation; we also found interplay between adpa and clpp <dig>  <cit> . here, we report microarray experiments, quantitative real-time pcr , in silico analysis and protein/dna interaction studies that identify other genes directly regulated by adpa in s. lividans. finally, in silico genome analysis allowed the identification of over hundred genes that are probably directly activated or repressed by adpa in s. lividans. these findings and observations reveal new adpa-dependent pathways in s. lividans.

methods
bacterial strains, growth conditions and media
s. lividans  <dig> was obtained from the john innes culture collection. in this s. lividans background, we constructed an adpa mutant in which adpa was replaced with an apramycin-resistance cassette  <cit> .

streptomyces was grown on ne plates  <cit>  and in yeme liquid medium  <cit>  in baffled flasks. ms medium was used for sporulation experiments  <cit> . apramycin was added to final concentrations of 25 μg ml- <dig> to solid media and 20 μg ml- <dig> to liquid media as appropriate.

microarray experiments
s. lividans microarrays were not available, so s. coelicolor oligonucleotide arrays covering most open reading frames  of the genome  were used. aliquots of 60 ml of liquid yeme medium were inoculated with about  <dig> spores and incubated at 30°c with shaking at 200 rpm until early stationary phase . samples of 12 ml of culture  were then collected and rna extracted as previously described  <cit> . rna quality was assessed with an agilent  <dig> bioanalyser . rna indirect labelling and array hybridization were performed as described  <cit>  and hybridized microarrays were scanned with a genepix 4000a scanner .

statistical analysis of array data
r software  <cit>  was used for normalization and differential analysis. a loess normalization  <cit>  was performed on a slide-by-slide basis . a paired t-test was used for differential analysis. variance estimates for each gene were computed under the hypothesis of homoscedasticity, together with the benjamini and yekutieli p-value adjustment method  <cit> . only genes with a significant  fold change  were taken into consideration. empty and flagged spots were excluded, and only genes with no missing values were analysed. a few genes which displayed excessive variation were analysed using the vmixt method from the varmixt package  <cit> . we defined our cut-off for microarray data acquisition as fc < <dig>  or fc >  <dig>  with p-value <  <dig> . the genome of s. lividans  <dig> was sequenced only recently  <cit> , so we used the strepdb database  <cit> , and in some cases a basic local alignment search tool , to identify s. lividans orthologs  of s. coelicolor genes. we also used the protein classification scheme for the s. coelicolor genome available on the welcome trust sanger institute database  <cit> .

qrt-pcr analysis
oligonucleotide pairs specific for ccha , cchb , sli <dig>  sli <dig>  ramr , hyas  and hrdb   were designed using the beacon designer software . rna samples were extracted from cultures in yeme liquid medium at od450nm values of about  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . aliquots of 20 μg of rna were treated twice with  <dig> units of dnase i with the turbo dna-free reagent  for 30 min at 37°c. reverse transcription and quantitative real-time pcr were performed as previously described  <cit> . pcrs involved a hybridization step of 55°c, except for ramr, sli <dig> and cchb where a temperature of 58°c was used. each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated with at least two independent rna samples. the critical threshold cycle  was defined for each sample. the relative amounts of cdna for the tested genes were normalized to that of the hrdb gene transcript which did not vary under our experimental conditions . the change  in a transcript level was calculated using the following equations: Δct = ct - ct, ΔΔct = Δct - Δct, and ratio = 2-ΔΔct <cit> . student’s t test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between the expression level of tested genes and that of a reference gene. a p-value <  <dig>  was considered significant.

in silico analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
several adpa-binding site sequences, identified in s. griseus by dnase i footprinting experiments  <cit> , were used with the predetector software   <cit>  to generate a s. griseus matrix  <cit> . this matrix was used with the s. coelicolor genome sequence  to identify putative adpa-binding sites upstream from s. lividans adpa-dependent genes . the strepdb database  <cit>  and blast were used to identify s. lividans, s. coelicolor and s. griseus ortholog gene names.

radioactively labelled dna fragments  corresponding to promoter regions of putative s. lividans adpa-regulated genes were obtained by pcr. primers  were used to amplify the promoter regions of ccha , sli <dig>  sli <dig> , ramr and hyas as described elsewhere  <cit> . purified radiolabelled fragments  were then used with purified adpa histidine-tagged protein  in emsa as previously described  <cit> .

RESULTS
deletion of adpa affects the expression of hundreds of genes during early stationary phase
we had previously inactivated adpa in s. lividans and found that this adpa mutant failed to produce aerial mycelium on rich media and that its growth was comparable to that of the parental strain  <dig> in liquid yeme medium at 30°c  <cit> . expression studies with this s. lividans adpa mutant cultivated in liquid medium identified two differentiation-regulating factors  whose orfs were under the direct control of adpa  <cit> . we used transcriptome analysis of this adpa mutant to identify other adpa-dependent pathways in s. lividans; however, this analysis was performed using s. coelicolor microarrays  <cit>  because the s. lividans genome sequence was not yet available  <cit>  and the two species are very closely related  <cit> . total rna was isolated from s. lividans  <dig> and adpa cells during early stationary phase  because at this growth phase, s. coelicolor adpa is expressed  <cit> ; also the expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism in a s. coelicolor blda mutant  <cit> , a strain defective for adpa translation, starts to diverge from that in the wild-type.

global gene expression in the mutant was compared to that in the parental strain. the expression of more than  <dig> genes was affected in the adpa mutant at early stationary phase :  <dig> genes were significantly down-regulated , and  <dig> were up-regulated  with a p-value <  <dig>  . theses genes encode proteins of several different classes according to the welcome trust sanger institute s. coelicolor genome database  <cit> :  <dig> of the genes are involved in metabolism of small molecules, including seven playing a role in electron transport  ;  <dig> encode proteins involved in secondary metabolism, for example the ccha-cchf gene cluster  involved in coelichelin biosynthesis  <cit>  and the sli0339- <dig> cluster encoding the putative deoxysugar synthase/glycosyltransferase. deletion of adpa in s. lividans also affected the expression of  <dig> genes involved in regulation including ramr , wbla , bldn , hrdd  and cutrs   <cit> . sixty-two genes involved in the cell envelope  <cit>  were differentially expressed in the adpa mutant; they include hyas   <cit> , chpe, chph <cit> , sli <dig> and sli <dig> which were strongly down-regulated in the adpa mutant . thirty-nine genes encoding proteins involved in various cellular processes   <cit>  were also deregulated in the absence of adpa . the expression of  <dig> genes coding for proteins with unidentified or unclassified function was altered in the adpa mutant. thus, deletion of adpa influenced the expression of a large number of genes involved in a broad range of metabolic pathways, and indeed other functions, in s. lividans.

identification of new adpa-controlled genes
to confirm that s. lividans adpa controls the expression of genes identified as differentially expressed in microarray experiments, six genes were studied in more detail by qrt-pcr. the six genes were selected as having biological functions related to streptomyces development or the cell envelope  or primary or secondary metabolism , and for having very large fold-change values . the genes in s. coelicolor and griseus orthologous to sli <dig> and sli <dig> encode secreted proteins  <cit> . the expression levels of these genes in s. lividans wild-type and adpa strains were measured after various times of growth in liquid yeme media , as shown in figure 1a.

the s. lividans hyas gene was strongly down-regulated in the adpa mutant compared to the wild-type   as previously observed for the sco <dig> homolog also known as sti <dig> <cit> . this suggests that hyas expression is strongly dependent on s. lividans adpa or an adpa-dependent regulator. sli <dig>  sli <dig> and ramr, were also expressed at a lower level in the adpa mutant than wild-type, particularly after mid-exponential phase ; cchb seemed to be mostly affected by adpa during stationary phase . the expression of ccha was strongly down-regulated by the absence of adpa at times d and t : note that despite repeated efforts, ccha expression could not be detected in samples corresponding to times a to c for unknown reasons. the findings for gene expression as determined by microarrays and by qrt-pcr were consistent, with the exception of those for ramr. the expression of ramr observed by qrt-pcr at time t differed from that determined in microarray experiments , suggesting that some of our microarray data are flattened. nevertheless, these qrt-pcr experiments confirmed that the expression of the six selected genes is indeed adpa-dependent in s. lividans at every growth time studied.

direct binding of adpa to the promoter regions of s. lividans adpa regulon members
to determine whether s. lividans adpa directly controls these genes, we searched for potential adpa-binding sites in their promoter regions in silico. a consensus adpa-binding sequence  has been established in s. griseus, and adpa can bind up to five sites between positions -260 bp and +60 bp with respect to the transcriptional start point of the target gene  <cit> . blast analysis revealed that the s. griseus adpa dna-binding domain is conserved in s. coelicolor and s. lividans adpas  suggesting that all three species share the same adpa-binding consensus sequence.

the dna sequences upstream from the s. coelicolor ramr and hyas genes and the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed genes ccha/cchb, sco0774/sco <dig> and sco6197/sco <dig> were analyzed using predetector software  <cit>  and a matrix was generated with identified s. griseus adpa-binding sequences  <cit> . between three and nine putative adpa-binding sites were detected within the promoter region of the s. coelicolor genes and by analogy in orthologous s. lividans adpa-dependent genes . during the course of this study, the s. lividans  <dig> genome sequence became available  <cit>    <cit> ) and its analysis suggested that the position and composition of adpa-binding sites were different from those predicted. the putative adpa-binding sites of s. lividans ccha/cchb at -101 nt and -86 nt are gggccggttc and tggctggaac, respectively. the adpa-binding sites located upstream of sli <dig>  sli <dig>  and hyas differ from their s. coelicolor orthologs .

we used emsa to test whether s. lividans adpa binds to predicted s. lividans adpa-binding sequence. recombinant purified adpa-his <dig> bound to the promoter region of s. lividans sti <dig> , an adpa-dependent gene, whereas an excess of adpa-his <dig>  did not bind to the promoter of sli <dig> , a gene that is not controlled by s. lividans adpa. this suggests that the binding of adpa with the promoter of genes tested in our previous study was specific  <cit> . adpa-his <dig> was able to bind to the promoter regions of all s. lividans adpa-dependent genes tested , although with different affinities. for sli6586/sli <dig>  ramr and hyas, displacement of the dna fragment to the slower migrating protein-dna complex was nearly complete with amounts of adpa of less than  <dig> pmoles . for ccha/cchb and sli0755/sli <dig>  larger amounts of adpa were necessary for near complete displacement of the dna probe to a protein-dna complex. in a competition emsa performed on sli6586/ <dig> with an excess of the corresponding unlabelled probe, adpa-binding to the labelled probe decreased . we also tested a hyas promoter in which one  of the three putative adpa-binding sites was mutated : the affinity of adpa for this promoter region was reduced and one protein-dna complex disappeared . these results suggest that one dimer of adpa binds the adjacent sites - <dig> and - <dig> of s. lividans hyas promoter and another dimer binds the - <dig> site resulting in the formation of the two dna-adpa complexes depicted in figure  <dig> 

these emsa experiments demonstrated that s. lividans adpa directly binds to five intergenic regions and confirmed the in silico prediction presented in table  <dig>  s. lividans adpa directly regulates at least the six adpa-dependent genes listed above and identified by microarrays and qrt-pcr analysis. these newly identified targets highlight the pleiotropic role of s. lividans adpa: it is involved in primary  and secondary  metabolisms, in regulation , and in cell development .

discussion
adpa, a transcriptional regulator of the arac/xyls family, is involved in the development and differentiation of various streptomyces <cit> . we report here the first identification of several pathways directly regulated by adpa in s. lividans cultivated in liquid rich medium.

inactivation of adpa in s. lividans affected the expression of approximately  <dig> genes. this large number was expected in the light of the size of the s. griseus adpa regulon  <cit> . although adpa mutant growth was comparable to that of the parental strain in yeme liquid medium, the expression of around  <dig> genes involved in primary metabolism was influenced by adpa deletion. these genes encode proteins involved in the major biosynthesis pathways for amino acids   <cit> , and in energy metabolism  including glycolysis, pentose phosphate, pyruvate dehydrogenase pathways, as well as in electron transport . other s. lividans adpa-regulated genes influence streptomyces development on solid media    <cit> . s. lividans adpa also influences the expression of  <dig> genes involved in secondary metabolism such as coelichelin biosynthesis   <cit>  and also genes described to affect metabolic differentiation    <cit> . consistently with transcriptomic studies in s. griseus, these observations suggest that adpa is a pleiotropic transcriptional regulator in s. lividans.

we demonstrate that s. lividans adpa directly activates cchb, sli <dig> and hyas. as a result of their co-transcription with these genes, the expression of cchcd, sli <dig> and sco7658-ortholog genes is adpa-dependent in s. lividans . sli <dig> is probably a directly adpa-regulated gene because its promoter dna region is shared with sli0755-sli <dig> operon, which is transcribed in the opposite direction and directly regulated by adpa .

adpa directly regulates the genes ramr and sti <dig> in s. lividans   <cit>  and in the closely related species s. coelicolor <cit> . in an s. coelicolor adpa mutant, levels of sti <dig> and ramr expression were lower than in the wild-type strain following growth for 48 h in a minimal agar medium  <cit> . in vitro experiments showed a high affinity of adpa with a s. coelicolor sti <dig> probe  <cit> , consistent with our results with s. lividans sti <dig> <cit> . however, adpa had a lower affinity to s. coelicolor ramr  than s. lividans ramr . when we used a s. lividans ramr probe carrying the promoter region from -201 nt to +66 nt, we observed that less than half the probe was shifted . therefore, the predicted sites for ramr promoter at positions - <dig> and - <dig>  may have the greatest affinity for adpa . of the genes analysed by qrt-pcr, the ramr gene was that for which the observed expression was the least consistent with the microarray findings, even through the same sample was used for these analyses. this suggests that the expression of genes close to the cut-off we applied to the microarray data will need further investigation by qrt-pcr.

among the  <dig> genes identified as direct targets of adpa in s. griseus,  <dig> have no orthologous gene in s. lividans and the orthologous genes of six are not under the control of s. lividans adpa in our conditions. in addition to ramr  and sti <dig> , hyas  is also a directly adpa-regulated gene that is conserved in the s. lividans and s. griseus adpa regulons  <cit> . in s. lividans, hyas affects hypha aggregation and the amount of mycelium-associated undecylprodigiosin  <cit> ; its function in s. griseus is unknown. the expression of all of bldn, sli <dig>  sli <dig> and the sco <dig> ortholog  is influenced by adpa deletion in s. lividans. it remains to be determined whether adpa directly controls s. lividans adpa and blda as described in s. coelicolor and griseus <cit> .

s. coelicolor adpa is one of  <dig> identified tta-containing genes; the production of the proteins encoded by these genes is dependent on blda, encoding the only trna for the rare leucine codon tta  <cit> . our study has revealed that expression of  <dig> tta-containing genes and of  <dig> genes regulated by s. coelicolor blda <cit>  was affected by adpa deletion in s. lividans . we show that ccha, cchb, sti <dig>  hyas, sli <dig> and sli <dig>  previously identified in s. coelicolor as blda-dependent genes, are direct targets of s. lividans adpa  <cit> . of the  <dig> other blda-dependent genes,  <dig> are probable direct s. lividans adpa targets: in silico analysis indicated the presence of putative adpa-binding sites upstream from these genes . by analogy, this suggests that the deregulation of certain genes observed in the s. coelicolor blda mutant may have been the consequence of s. coelicolor adpa down-regulation, as previously suggested  <cit> .

to predict probable direct targets of adpa in s. lividans and contribute to knowledge of the adpa regulon, we carried out in silico analysis of the entire s. coelicolor genome using predetector  <cit> , and also restricted to the s. lividans genes identified as being adpa-dependent . we identified  <dig> genes probably directly activated by s. lividans adpa and  <dig> genes that could be directly repressed . most of the putative adpa-binding sites identified by this analysis are coherent with the findings of yao et al., demonstrating the importance of g and c nucleotides at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . six genes have been identified as directly regulated by adpa in other species   <cit> , and  <dig> more in s. griseus are also probable adpa-direct targets   <cit> . sixty-three of the  <dig> probable direct targets of adpa in s. lividans have no ortholog in the s. griseus genome .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has extended our knowledge of the s. lividans adpa regulon. we identified s. lividans adpa-regulated genes by transcriptomic analysis, and used in silico analysis to identify over a hundred probable direct targets of adpa in s. lividans. most of them are absent from the current predicted s. griseus adpa regulon. discovering new s. lividans genes directly regulated by adpa and that are involved in primary and secondary metabolism will provide valuable information about streptomyces development and differentiation in liquid culture.
