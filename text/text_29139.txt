BACKGROUND
malaria parasites, particularly plasmodium falciparum, impose heavy economic and health burdens on human population worldwide  <cit> . hundreds of millions of people are infected by the parasite each year, leading to 1– <dig> million deaths annually. lack of effective vaccines and emergence of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquito vectors are the main reasons for the failure in controlling the parasites and the associated disease. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, the molecular basis of the host immune response, and the strategies the parasite employs to evade host immunity is critical for vaccine and drug development.

genetic variation in parasites can contribute to drug resistance, immune evasion, and disease manifestation. genetic mapping is one of the powerful approaches for the identification of mutations that cause drug resistance and changes in other phenotypes  <cit> . for efficient mapping of a target gene, it is often necessary to genotype a large number of polymorphic markers. in addition to length polymorphisms such as microsatellites and minisatellites and large-scale sequencing, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been identified from many organisms, including p. falciparum, for genotyping and mapping genes associated with different phenotypes  <cit> . high-throughput snp typing methods have also been developed  <cit> , leading to recent successful identification of candidate genes  associated with various human diseases  <cit> .

one of the high-throughput typing methods is array-based hybridization. in this method, labeled genomic dna is hybridized to microarrays comprising high-density short oligonucleotides designed based on known snp or systematically tiled along all chromosomes to detect potential polymorphisms. high-density arrays have been successfully used to detect variation in copy number  <cit>  and snp  <cit> . the human malaria parasite p. falciparum has a genome with extremely high at content  as well as numerous repetitive sequences  <cit> , making array design and data analysis challenging. hybridizations of p. falciparum genomic dna to both affymetrix genechips® and slides printed with  <dig> mer oligonucleotides have been reported previously  <cit> . kidgell et al. recently used an array with  <dig>  probes to identify  <dig>  single feature polymorphisms  among  <dig> isolates. the results from this study suggest that high-density array could be a promising tool for high-throughput detection of genome variations including snp and copy number variations . however, calling snp based on hybridization signals is a complex process, and many factors can affect snp calling, including array design, gc content of a probe, the position of the snp in a probe, hybridization conditions, and algorithms used to analyze array signals. additionally, methods were developed to call sfp in many previous studies, but the accuracy of sfp calls were not verified with known snp or through dna sequencing. to investigate the influences of these factors on calling sfp in a highly at-rich genome and to develop a reliable method for calling sfp from the p. falciparum genome using commercially available array platforms, we have analyzed data from a high-density 'tiling' array with ~ <dig>  million  <dig> mer probes designed at the sanger institute  to detect genomic variations in five p. falciparum field isolates. genomic dna samples from the five parasite isolates were hybridized to the array, and signals from the parasites were compared with known snp  <cit>  to evaluate snp calling accuracy under different conditions. based on the comparison, we identified factors that could affect probe/dna hybridization dynamics and established a set of conditions that allowed us to call sfp/snp with ≥ 94% accuracy. we also sequenced  <dig> sfp calls that did not agree with known snp and found that ~64% of the 'wrong' calls were actually due to errors in the genome sequences. parameters that provided best snp calling accuracy were used to identify  <dig>  potential snp, including ~ <dig>  new sfp that have not been reported previously.

RESULTS
basic probe statistics and quality control
the array has  <dig>  million perfect-matched probes  with  <dig> , <dig> p. falciparum-specific probes . of the p. falciparum probes,  <dig> , <dig> mapped uniquely to the genome and  <dig>  mapped to more than one location or were not assigned to any chromosomes. among the unique probes,  <dig> , <dig> were in the predicted coding regions ;  <dig> , <dig> probes were within exons;  <dig>  probes were intergenic;  <dig>  were within introns;  <dig>  probes spanned exon/intron junctions, and  <dig>  probes spanned the predicted translation start sites or stop codons.

genomic dna from five different parasites  were labeled and hybridized  to the pfsanger genechip®. after normalization of the hybridization signals across all array chips, an average signal intensity for each probe was calculated from replicates of each parasite. the qualities of the hybridizations were evaluated using various methods including ma plots, scatter plots , and coefficient of variance  tests . good reproducibility was obtained among replicates with the majority of the probes  having cv less than 25% . histograms of signal ratios relative to 3d <dig>  the reference genome, showed similar data distribution among different parasite samples .

probe coverage of known snp
accurate snp calling and detection of insertions/deletions requires optimization of calling parameters. here we evaluated potential factors that might affect sfp calling accuracy by comparing known snp between 3d <dig> and four other parasites  identified in our previous study   <cit>  and hybridization signal ratios. among the  <dig>  niaid snp  identified previously,  <dig>   were covered by  <dig>  probes, including  <dig>  covered by  <dig>  probes in the predicted exons. the majority of the snp were covered by 1– <dig> probes , with a maximum coverage of  <dig> probes/snp . overall, the snp were distributed evenly across the  <dig> mer positions in the probe, with ~94% of probes having one snp .

probe gc content and hybridization intensity
because gc content in a probe is known to affect probe/dna hybridization dynamics, we investigated the influence of probe gc content on hybridization signal intensity. the gc effect is likely exaggerated even more for the at-rich genome of p. falciparum genome. the majority of the probes in the array have gc contents of 15% to 40% . signal intensity was similarly low for probes with gc content <16%, but for probes with gc content of 16% or higher, signal intensity increased with the increase of gc content until ~40%, when signal intensity began to plateau . signal intensity did not change much from 40% to 80% gc in 3d7; however, the intensity began to decrease and fluctuate dramatically after reaching 50% gc content in non-3d <dig> parasites . reduction in signal intensity in non-3d <dig> parasites suggested high levels of polymorphism in these probes. in the parasite genome, the first exons of the var gene family have a relatively high gc content and are highly variable in dna sequence. these high-gc-content probes are therefore likely from the var genes. comparison of the high-gc probes with var gene sequences showed that ~44% of the  <dig>  probes with 50% or higher gc content were from the var genes. these probes likely contributed to the dramatic variation in signal ratio between parasites . these results suggest that probes with gc content <16% and the var probes with >50% might not be reliable for the detection of sfp for genetic mapping of the p. falciparum traits.

substitution positions in a probe and hybridization dynamics
the position of a nucleotide substitution in a probe can also influence probe hybridization intensity. a substitution in the middle of a probe is expected to affect hybridization stability more dramatically than a change at the end positions of a probe. comparison of average signal ratios between 3d <dig> and the other four parasites and snp at known probe positions showed that substitutions at the two end positions  of a probe did not affect probe-target hybridization; and substitutions at position  <dig> and  <dig> had minimal effect on signal intensity . signal ratios  of probes with snp from position  <dig> to position  <dig> increased from both ends, averaging more than  <dig> times of the probes without polymorphism. for all positions in a probe, the average signal ratios were approximately the same  if there was no known polymorphism in a probe. for probes that had known snp, the signal ratio was generally  <dig> or higher if two positions at each end of a probe were excluded . our data showed that substitutions located at probe position 3– <dig>  had a strong effect on hybridization intensity and should be considered for sfp detection .

estimates of correct sfp call rates
we next evaluated different signal cutoff ratios to obtain a value that produced the best sfp calling accuracy realizing that this ratio would balance false positive and false negative calling rates. we found that a signal cutoff ratio of  <dig>  produced the highest overall correct call rates  for dd <dig>  hb <dig>  and 7g <dig> . correct call rates increased slightly after removing probes with high and low gc contents and increased further after excluding calls from single probes and calls with probe vote ratio < 75%. in contrast, correct call rates decreased with the increase of signal ratio cutoff values, likely because of the exclusion of some real sfp with relatively lower signal ratios. even using a signal cutoff ratio of  <dig> , we obtained correct call rates ≥ 85%. after correcting for wrong calls due to sequence errors , we obtained correct call rates ≥ 94% . the call rate for fcr <dig> could not be estimated accurately without known snp information.

to obtain the best correct call rates, we compared msfp calls using three cutoff values . first we called msfp using unique probes and probe position 3– <dig> . we repeated the calls after removing probes with gc contents < 16% and > 50% . we then obtained call rates after removing probes with gc content < 16% and > 50% and excluding calls with single probes and multiple probe calls with less than 75% probe votes . corrected rates were obtained after adjusting for  <dig> % error rate in the wrong calls due to sequence errors, which were calculated using formula

.

a correct call was defined as correct calls over the sum of correct, wrong, and tie calls.

sequencing verification of sfp calls
both false positive  and false negative  calls could be caused by sfp calling errors, sequencing mistakes, or problems in sequence alignment in the databases. to investigate whether the discrepancies between our sfp calls and the known snp were from array sfp calling or sequencing/alignment errors, we sequenced  <dig> fp or fn sfp calls  with different probe coverage and probe vote ratios to verify the calls. our results showed that  <dig> of the  <dig>  initial wrong calls were due to sequence errors in the databases, including four fp calls that did not have polymorphism at the expected sites but had new polymorphic sites nearby, leading to the incorrect fp calls . among the  <dig> true wrong-calls verified by sequencing,  <dig> were called by a single probe,  <dig> had mixed probes calls,  <dig> had two one-sided probe calls, and  <dig> had three one-sided probe calls. if we excluded calls from single probes and mixed probe calls having a probe vote ratio <75% , we would have had only four calls that were incorrect . in other words, 92%  of the calls would have been correct if we had excluded single probe calls and calls with a probe call vote ratio of <75%. if we apply these corrections, we obtain a corrected overall sfp call rate of ≥ 94% even using a conservative cutoff value of  <dig>  .

gene id, gene id or snp id in plasmodb; chr position, chromosomal position of the polymorphic site; mism alle, mismatched alleles of our array calls and known niaid snp between 3d <dig> and 7g8; sfpn, calls not matching known snp, either false positive  or false negative . the numbers in the parentheses are numbers of probes calling for sfp or no sfp. for example, fp indicates three probes called for a sfp and no probe called for no sfp, but there was no known snp in the databases; and fn indicates three probes called for no sfp, but a known snp existed ; 3d <dig>  alleles obtained from sequencing 3d <dig> dna; and 7g <dig>  alleles obtained from sequencing 7g <dig> dna sequences. the gene id in italic indicates snp not confirmed by sequencing  using  <dig>  cutoff ratio and 3– <dig> positions in a probe; and those in bold had additional polymorphisms supporting the array calls. tat in mal <dig>  is a trinucleotide missing in 7g <dig>  forward and reverse are primers used in amplification and sequencing of the pcr products.

use of receiver operating characteristic  curves to estimate call rates
to further test the reliability of our method in calling sfp, we also used a roc curve to evaluate sfp calling accuracy and applied local pooled error  analysis to obtain z-scores for calling sfp  <cit> . lpe generates corrected z-scores that reduce fp, which might result when sample variance happens to be low, by using a 'pooled' variance for all the probes that show similar intensities. the roc curve is a graphic plot of sensitivity vs.  or fraction of true positive vs. the fraction of fp  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  if we allowed a fp rate of approximately 2% , and at a z-score of ~ <dig> , we could obtain a sensitivity of call rate ~81% genome-wide for data from 7g <dig>  dd <dig>  and hb <dig> 

sfp were called using z-scores of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  and compared with sfp called using signal ratio cutoffs of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . results from cutoffs of z-score of  <dig>  and signal ratio of  <dig>  had the best overall matches  and the best positive sfp call matches  for all  <dig> chromosomes. to minimize fp calls  from unknown parasites that might have higher background, however, we decided to use a conservative signal ratio cutoff value of  <dig> . using this cutoff value, almost all  of the positive calls matched a positive call from a z-score cutoff  <dig> .

detection of genome-wide substitutions among field isolates
we used a conservative signal cutoff ratio of  <dig>  and all the parameters discussed above  to call sfp and obtained  <dig>  msfp genome-wide among the five parasites, including  <dig>  unique msfp from 3d <dig>   <dig>  from 7g <dig>   <dig>  from dd <dig>   <dig>  from hb <dig>  and  <dig>  from fcr <dig> . inspection of the calls revealed that the large number of 3d <dig> unique calls was largely from multigene families such as var, rif, and stevor. we therefore flagged msfp from multigene families  and their paralogs. excluding msfp from these genes removed approximately 67% of the sfp and reduced the total number of msfp to  <dig> , including  <dig>  unique msfp for 3d <dig>   <dig>  for hb <dig>   <dig>  for fcr <dig>   <dig>  for dd <dig>  and  <dig>  for 7g <dig> . a list of sfp and msfp in each predicted gene and genes that are highly polymorphic  can be found in additional file  <dig> 

*parasite isolate order is 7g <dig>  dd <dig>  fcr <dig>  and hb <dig>  for example, '1000' indicates the numbers of unique alleles for 7g <dig>  a '0' indicates that a parasite has the same allele as that of 3d <dig> , and '1' indicates a different allele . the numbers in the first row were positions with probes but no sfp were called . these numbers were not counted in the total calculation. the counts were based on a signal cutoff value of  <dig> . note these calls were msfp and were different from those defined previously, where each probe was defined as an independent sfp <cit> .

some chromosomes appeared to have unusually large numbers of msfp calls from some parasites. for example, dd <dig> had  <dig> unique msfp from chromosome  <dig>  whereas the other four parasites had fewer than  <dig> msfp . close inspection of the calls revealed that the majority of the extra msfp was from a deletion at one end of chromosome  <dig> in dd <dig> . similarly, the higher numbers of msfp from chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of hb <dig> were from specific regions either deleted or having highly polymorphic genes in a specific parasite .

genome-wide msfp distribution
sfp and msfp were uploaded into the gbrowse genome browser at the abcc website  <cit>  for genome-wide display of the polymorphic site. probe sequences and locations in predicted exons, introns, and intergenic regions were mapped to chromosomes. snp in the plasmodb and our sfp/msfp calls were also displayed in the browser with allele information from each parasite. as shown in the browser, the majority of our msfp  matched well with the plasmodb snp , including snp in the pfcrt . this comparison identified ~ <dig>  new unique msfp  from the five parasite genomes.

we noticed that many of the plasmodb snp  were located on chromosomal regions that did not have probe coverage . because the majority of the regions without probe coverage were likely in areas of at-rich repetitive and/or noncoding sequences, the observation suggested that relatively larger numbers of snp in the plasmodb could be from repetitive sequences.

we next counted msfp in a window of 10-kb segments and plotted msfp from each segment along the chromosomes to investigate msfp distribution on the chromosomes from each parasite . again, these plots showed clusters of some highly polymorphic regions, mostly at chromosome ends, corresponding to var/rif/stevor clusters. the plots also identified some unique peaks for individual parasite, for example, a unique peak on chromosome  <dig> for dd <dig> and hb <dig>  respectively. these unique peaks were likely due to deleted dna segments or reflected the unique selection and evolutionary histories in an individual parasite .

genome-wide cnv
genome-wide segmentation analyses showed that there were relatively few large-scale amplifications or deletions among the parasites . the  <dig> largest amplified regions were a ~ <dig> kb on chromosome  <dig> of fcr <dig>  a ~80– <dig> kb on chromosome  <dig> of dd <dig> and fcr <dig>  a ~ <dig> kb on chromosome  <dig> of fcr <dig>  a ~ <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig> for hb <dig>  and various sizes  in the middle of chromosome  <dig> for different parasites. the chromosome  <dig> amplified region contained a total of  <dig> unique genes, including  <dig> genes  amplified ~2– <dig> copies in fcr <dig> and  <dig> genes  amplified ~4– <dig> copies in dd <dig>  with a total of  <dig> genes shared by the two parasites. eight of the shared genes were predicted to encode proteins related to ribosomal subunits, atp-dependant helicase, nucleotide binding, s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, mitochondrial processing peptidase, g <dig>  and multidrug resistance homolog protein, pfpgh- <dig>  similarly, segments of different sizes located at the middle of chromosome  <dig> were amplified ~7– <dig> copies in 7g <dig> , ~ <dig> copies in dd <dig> , ~3– <dig> copies in fcr <dig> , and ~2– <dig> copies in hb <dig> . only two genes  were amplified in all of the four parasites, one of which was a gene encoding putative ribosomal protein l <dig>  a large region on chromosome  <dig> from hb <dig> containing  <dig> genes  was amplified 2-3x, four of the genes were predicted to encode ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen, antigen  <dig>  and ser/thr protein kinase. the amplified region on chromosome  <dig> of fcr <dig>  contained genes encoding a putative reticulocyte-binding protein  <dig> and four hypothetical proteins  and was amplified at least five times. this amplified segment may play a role in the higher growth rate for this parasite, because the reticulocyte-binding protein may facilitate parasite invasion.

the majority of the regions with reduced signals  were located on chromosomes ends or regions containing the var/rif/stevor gene clusters, reflecting the highly variable nature of these dna regions . although it is difficult to distinguish highly polymorphic regions from deletions in this haploid genome, we considered several additional restrictions to exclude potential polymorphic loci. a segment was considered not truly deleted if it contained known highly polymorphic genes such as var/rif/stevor  <cit>  or if a segment had reduced signals in all four parasites . for segments with reduced signal ratios occurring only in one or two parasites, they were more likely to be true deletions, which could also be detected in msfp distribution plots . for example, a deletion of ~42-kb segment  on chromosome  <dig> of dd <dig> and fcr <dig> was found to contain a gene encoding knob-associated histidine-rich protein . deletion of kahrp in dd <dig> was reported previously  <cit> . another likely deleted segment was a ~98-kb region on chromosome  <dig> of hb <dig> containing  <dig> genes  including the gene encoding cytoadherence linked asexual protein  and lysophospholipase. again, deletion of this region had been reported  <cit> . a list of chromosome segments and mapped genes potentially amplified or deleted/highly polymorphic, including those reported previously, can be found in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
the pfsanger array, despite having ~ <dig>  million p. falciparum probes, was not designed specifically for snp detection, and whether it was suitable for snp detection was not certain. this study was initiated to investigate the possibility of using the pfsanger array for genetic mapping and population studies. the large number of probes on the chip and their high at content  require critical evaluation of factors that may affect hybridization dynamics before sfp can be reliably called. based on comparison of msfp calls with known snp identified previously  <cit> , we showed that the last two end positions in a probe had limited influence on hybridization signal and that probes with gc contents lower than 16% should be excluded for sfp calling in this genome. we also found that msfp calls based on a single probe were not reliable after resequencing. for a potential msfp call, a conservative signal cutoff ratio of 3– <dig>  and a vote among several adjacent probes  with a majority of the probes  should be applied. we demonstrated that this particular microarray could be successfully employed to detect msfp with high msfp calling accuracy . this work provides important information for calling msfp in the p. falicparum genome using microarrays.

we used a  <dig>  cutoff ratio in calling sfp because for genetic mapping, a high fp rate may lead to misleading results that should be minimized. a higher cutoff value may result in a higher fn rate or missing some calls too. missing some calls will not be a big issue as the array can detect a large number of sfp. the  <dig>  cutoff therefore represents a conservative value for minimizing fp calls, considering potential higher backgrounds that may exist in some field isolates such as fcr <dig> in this study. higher background in fcr <dig> requires further investigations, although signal intensity and distribution from this parasite appeared to be similar to those from other parasites . a sample mixed with a smaller percentage of dna from a different genotype  may increase the hybridization background signal. indeed, typing dna from the fcr <dig> parasite with microsatellites showed that the dna sample appeared to contain a secondary peak in some markers . if this is true, a sample with high background may have to be discarded.

using an array with a much higher density of probes than those published previously  <cit> , we identified  <dig>  msfp from five isolates, including ~ <dig>  new msfp after excluding msfp from multigene families. among the  <dig>  msfp, ~67% were in clusters of highly polymorphic genes such as var/rif/stevor. approximately 89% of our msfp calls that also had probes spanning known snp in plasmodb matched the snp, reflecting relative high accuracy of our msfp calls, although our stringent cutoff values may lead to higher fn rates or "no-calls" . our msfp also provided additional evidence confirming the snp reported previously, which is important because the majority of snp in plasmodb were generated from shotgun sequences and sequence alignments have not been visually inspected or adjusted. for a genome with large number of repetitive sequences, sequence alignment errors can be generated if sequence alignment is totally relied on computer software  <cit> .

distributions of msfp across the chromosomes among the parasites were very similar except for a few unique peaks that may reflect deletion or amplification in each individual parasite. if we exclude the msfp from the multigene families, we obtained  <dig>  msfp or approximately  <dig> bp per sfp in the genome, a frequency that is within the range  of our previous estimates  <cit>  and similar to an estimate of  <dig> bp per snp by another group  <cit> . if we consider 45% of the  <dig>  msfp from five isolates as common msfp, as estimated previously  <cit> , we can expect ~ <dig>  common msfp in the five parasite genomes that will be useful for genetic mapping.

the highly at-rich p. falciparum genome has a large number of repetitive sequences and low complexity regions in protein coding sequences  <cit> . the non-coding regions consist of more than 40% of the genome and generally have at content >90% with large numbers of polymorphic at repeats and polya/t tracts  <cit> . these high-at regions not only present a problem for genome sequencing and dna sequence alignment but also make it difficult to design sequence-specific probes with reliable hybridization dynamics. snp in these regions may not be very useful for mapping purposes because of difficulty in designing oligonucleotide probes or pcr primers for genotyping. indeed, analyses of signal intensity from probes with different gc contents showed that probes with gc contents <16% produced similar low signals, suggesting that these probes might not be practical for calling msfp. of interest, probes with gc content >50% also produced highly variable signals. the majority of high-gc probes from the variable var genes can partly contribute to this variation. we excluded probes with gc content >50% for several reasons: 1) approximately 44% of the probes with gc content >50% were var probes that should be discarded; 2) probes with high gc content would have higher 'affinity' than those with lower gc content during hybridization. a substitution in a probe with high gc content may not reduce the hybridization signal as much as a probe with low gc content; 3) there were only ~ <dig> probes with gc contents >50%. exclusion of these probes should not have significant impact on our sfp calls.

the p. falciparum chromosomes have been shown to be highly variable in size in pulse-field gel electrophoresis   <cit> . genomic segmentation analysis to detect chromosome deletion and amplification showed relatively few amplification/deletion events with segment size >  <dig>  kb. the variation in chromosome sizes seen in pfg gels could be mainly due to chromosome translocation, which is difficult if not impossible to detect using microarrays. one of the amplified regions was a segment on chromosome  <dig> containing the pfmdr <dig> gene in the dd <dig> and fcr <dig> parasites. amplification of the pfmdr <dig> locus has been reported  <cit> , which could be due to drug selection pressure  <cit> . similarly, there were few deletions larger than  <dig> kb; many of the deleted/amplified regions detected in our study matched well with those reported previously  <cit> . two well-known deleted regions on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were detected in our analyses  <cit> . detection of previously reported deletions suggested that our methods for detecting deletion/amplification were working properly. however, using an array with higher probe density than previous studies, we also discovered many deletions/amplifications that have not been described previously . we identified  <dig> amplified and  <dig> highly variable or deleted genes or fragments,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of which, respectively, were reported previously  <cit> . some of the discrepancies were likely due to different filtering criteria used . because of our small parasite sample size, it is difficult to make any functional inferences from the amplifications and deletions found in this study, although amplification at the pfmdr <dig> locus may be associated with responses to some anti-malarial drugs  <cit> , and amplification of chromosome  <dig> in fcr <dig> may contribute to its adaptation to higher growth rates.

CONCLUSIONS
this study developed methods for accurate detection of msfp and cnv in the p. falciparum genome after evaluating factors that can influence dna hybridization dynamics. more than  <dig>  msfp, including ~ <dig>  new and unique msfp, and various chromosomal amplification/deletions were identified from the p. falciparum genome. nearly 70% of the polymorphic sites are in clusters of var/rif/stevor gene families. use of this array to analyze dna samples from large numbers of parasites will facilitate our understanding of parasite diversity and evolution and genetic mapping of important parasite traits.
