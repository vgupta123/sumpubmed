BACKGROUND
in the central nervous system , axons mostly fail to regenerate given the inhibitory environment and the lack of activation of neuronal-intrinsic regeneration-associated pathways. it is, however, possible to stimulate the intrinsic growth capacity of cns axons. when the peripheral branch of a dorsal root ganglia  neuron is injured prior to lesion to its central branch , the central axons can overcome the glial scar inhibitory effect and regenerate  <cit> . although several molecules have been identified as required for the conditioning effect, none was proven to be sufficient and necessary to mimic the conditioning lesion, probably as a combination of various mechanisms is needed.

microtubule organization is crucial for axon regeneration. while cns axons respond to injury by forming a retraction bulb with a disorganized network of microtubules, peripheral nervous system  axons form a growth cone composed by a backbone of stable microtubules and dynamic microtubules in the axon tip  <cit> . pharmacological destabilization of microtubules converts a growth cone into a retraction bulb, and stabilization leads to the formation of growth cone-like structures  <cit>  and increases axonal regeneration in vivo, after spinal cord injury   <cit> . accordingly, histone deacetylase  <dig>  inhibition enhances tubulin acetylation and promotes axon growth on inhibitory substrates  <cit> . in contrast, it has been shown that in the pns, axons have a higher regenerative capacity as they activate a program leading to the activation of histone deacetylase  <dig>  and to a lower microtubule stability close to the injury site  <cit> .

here, we further explored the mechanisms underlying the gain of regenerative capacity in conditioned drg neurons and identified glycogen synthase kinase 3β  as an important player in this process. gsk3β is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates several microtubule-interacting proteins, namely collapsin response mediator protein  <dig> , microtubule-associated proteins , microtubule plus end-tracking proteins ) and the microtubule-depolymerizing factor stathmin  <cit> . the activity of gsk3β is regulated by phosphorylation. under resting conditions, the kinase is constitutively active following phosphorylation of its tyr <dig> residue, located in the kinase domain  <cit> . the mechanism of tyr <dig> phosphorylation has been proposed to correspond to an autocatalytic event  <cit>  although in neurons, kinases such as pyk <dig> and fyn have also been proposed as responsible for this phosphorylation  <cit> . exposure of neuroblastoma cells to the general tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ortho-vanadate led to increased levels of tyr <dig> phosphorylation, raising the hypothesis that a group of yet unidentified tyrosine phosphatases might regulate the phosphorylation of tyr <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, regulation of gsk3β activity is generally seen as resulting from inactivation by phosphorylation of its ser <dig> residue  <cit> . in response to extracellular signals that activate the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase  pathway, protein kinase b  is activated triggering the inactivation of gsk3β by phosphorylation of ser <dig>  <cit> .

the array of gsk3β substrates suggests that it is a key kinase regulating microtubule dynamics and an attractive molecule to study in the context of axon growth. however, controversy exists regarding gsk3β modulation during axonal regeneration as pharmacological inhibition of gsk3β was shown to promote either axonal growth  <cit>  or myelin-dependent axon outgrowth inhibition  <cit> . while most data relating gsk3β and axonal regeneration relied on semi-specific pharmacological inhibitors tested in vitro, to further determine the relevance of gsk3β during axonal regeneration in vivo, we used three gsk3β genetic mouse models with different levels of kinase activity: constitutively active gsk3βser9ala knockin  mice  <cit> , gsk3β knockout heterozygous mice  <cit>  and mice with neuron-specific deletion of gsk3β. our data show that increased microtubule dynamics in the growth cone are achieved following inactivation of the gsk3β-crmp- <dig> pathway, enhancing axon regeneration through the glial scar.

RESULTS
decreased gsk3β activity through downregulation of p-tyr <dig> is related to increased axonal regeneration
we used the conditioning lesion model  <cit>  to identify mechanisms promoting axonal regeneration. for that we analyzed drgs from rats with either sci or conditioning lesion using a phospho-site broad signaling pathway screen  that examines  <dig> phosphorylation sites in  <dig> key signaling proteins. in the cl group, sci was preceded one week by a sciatic nerve transection. as previously described  <cit> , rats with conditioning lesion had an increased number of dorsal column axons entering the glial scar , with some axons being capable of regenerating beyond the rostral border of the scar. as expected  <cit> , the conditioning effect was also observed in vitro as conditioned drg neurons  had an increased neurite outgrowth . the analysis of the phospho-site broad signaling pathway screen revealed that following conditioning lesion increased p-aktser <dig> , increased p-gsk3βser <dig> , and decreased p-gsk3βtyr <dig> were present . no differential phosphorylation of gsk3α was found . combined, these observations indicate that following a conditioning lesion there is an overall decrease of gsk3β activity. validation was performed by western blot in drg  where we also analyzed samples from uninjured animals. after conditioning lesion, increased p-aktser <dig> was found relative to both uninjured drg and drg collected after sci . regarding p-gsk3βser <dig>  although after sci the levels were increased relative to uninjured drg, a more pronounced increase was observed after conditioning lesion . the levels of p-gsk3βtyr <dig> were decreased after conditioning lesion, when compared to both uninjured drg and drg collected after sci . locally at the sci site no differences were found in p-gsk3βser <dig>  while p-gsk3βtyr <dig> was decreased after conditioning lesion . accordingly, in the growth cone of conditioned drg neurons a  <dig> -fold decreased ratio  of p-gsk3βtyr216/gsk3βwas present . the decreased p-gsk3βtyr <dig> levels at the sci site of rats with conditioning lesion correlated with a  <dig> -fold decrease in gsk3β kinase activity  and decreased phosphorylation of crmp- <dig> .

sci, spinal cord injury; cl, conditioning lesion; drg, dorsal root ganglia.

initial gsk3βtyr <dig> phosphorylation occurs through an autocatalytic event  <cit> , although the upstream kinases pyk <dig> and fyn can also target this residue  <cit> . whereas we did not detect pyk <dig> either in the drg or spinal cord, the inactive form of fyn kinase, p-fyntyr <dig>  was increased after conditioning lesion . moreover, drg neurons transfected with fyn kinase dead  had a  <dig> -fold decreased ratio  of p-gsk3βtyr216/gsk3β  in support of a fyn kinase-mediated phosphorylation of gsk3βtyr <dig> under these conditions. besides phosphorylation by fyn kinase, a  <dig> -fold higher phosphatase activity against p-gsk3βtyr <dig> was found in animals with conditioning lesion  further supporting a tight control of the p-gsk3βtyr <dig> levels, probably achieved by dual regulation of upstream kinases and phosphatases.

enhanced axonal growth in conditioned drg neurons is related to increased microtubule growth speed in the growth cone
our results showed a downregulation of gsk3β activity through decreased gsk3βtyr <dig> phosphorylation in conditioned neurons. given the involvement of gsk3β in microtubule dynamics, the microtubule growth rate in naïve and conditioned rat drg neurons was measured. for that, we visualized polymerizing microtubule ends by transfecting neurons with the plus-tip binding protein eb <dig>  when compared to naïve neurons, after conditioning lesion, eb <dig> comets moved with a  <dig> -fold increased speed . increased microtubule growth speed in conditioned neurons  correlated with increased neurite outgrowth . moreover, by extending the imaging periods, increased axon elongation and increased microtubule growth speed were observed in conditioned neurons, when compared to naïve neurons . regarding the number of growing microtubules, no differences were observed between naïve and conditioned drg neurons . moreover, in accordance with an increased microtubule growth speed in the growth cone, we observed that the eb <dig> fluorescence was located within a shorter distance from the growth cone tip in conditioned neurons . this suggests that in conditioned neurons, growth of microtubules into the peripheral domain of the growth cone is promoted. overall, conditioned drg neurons exhibited decreased gsk3β activity through downregulation of p-gsk3βtyr <dig> and increased microtubule growth speed and growth into the peripheral domain of the growth cone.

in vivo, inhibition of gsk3β via ser <dig> phosphorylation is dispensable for gain of axonal regeneration capacity
given that ser <dig> has been widely considered the key regulatory residue of gsk3β  <cit> , we used gsk3βser9ala knockin  mice  <cit>  to further assess its role in vivo during axonal regeneration. in these animals, the endogenous ser <dig> codon of gsk3β was changed to encode the non-phosphorylatable ala residue  <cit> . gsk3β activity in the spinal cord of gsk3βser9ala ki mice was increased  <dig> -fold when compared to wild type  mice , in agreement with the known inhibitory activity of ser <dig> phosphorylation. in vitro, naïve gsk3βser9ala ki drg neurons displayed a similar neurite outgrowth to that of naïve wt neurons and the percentage of longer neurites was increased following conditioning lesion . in vivo, tracing of dorsal column fibers with cholera toxin subunit b  after a spinal cord dorsal hemisection corroborated the in vitro data, with gsk3βser9ala ki axons displaying a similar behavior to that of wt axons . for both genotypes, we observed negligible axonal growth through the glial scar following sci, whereas an increased number of axons entering the glial scar able to regenerate for longer distances were seen following conditioning lesion . neither wt nor gsk3βser9ala ki mice showed axons extending rostrally beyond the glial scar, as the conditioning effect is less robust in mice than in rats  <cit> . these findings demonstrate that modulation of gsk3β through ser <dig> phosphorylation is not required to induce axonal growth. moreover, in the sci site, both wt and gsk3βser9ala ki mice were able to regulate gsk3β activity through reduced phosphorylation of tyr <dig> after conditioning lesion . in accordance with decreased gsk3β kinase activity after conditioning lesion, the levels of p-crmp- <dig> were decreased in the sci site of both wt and gsk3βser9ala ki mice . these results further support that downregulation of gsk3β activity through decreased tyr <dig> phosphorylation represents the primary regulatory event leading to increased axonal growth.

partial reduction of gsk3β activity increases axonal growth through the glial scar
to further demonstrate that decreased gsk3β activity is related to increased axonal growth, we assessed axonal regeneration in gsk3β knockout heterozygous mice )  <cit> . as expected, gsk3β  mice exhibit an approximately 50% reduction of gsk3β kinase activity in the spinal cord . assessment of axonal regeneration of ascending dorsal column fibers after a dorsal spinal cord hemisection by tracing with ct-b  showed that gsk3β  mice have an increased number of axons inside the glial scar  and that these are capable of regenerating for longer distances :  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm; p < <dig> ). the conditioning lesion is a very useful model to understand mechanisms underlying central axon regeneration and several molecules initially identified using this paradigm were later found to increase regeneration of other unrelated tracts. to evaluate whether downregulation of gsk3β activity might promote axonal regeneration of other tracts, regeneration of serotonergic axons was assessed. 5-hydroxytryptamine  immunostaining of descending raphespinal serotonergic axons after complete spinal cord transection  showed that the number of 5-ht-positive axons caudal to the lesion site was increased  <dig> -fold in gsk3β mice . this demonstrates that in a non-sensory tract, lower levels of gsk3β increase axonal regeneration through and beyond the glial scar. of note, the basal levels of 5-ht immunostaining in uninjured spinal cords were similar between wt and gsk3β mice . the increased regeneration of gsk3β serotonergic axons correlated with an improved recovery of open field locomotor activity , as expected given the modulation by serotonergic axons of the activity of spinal motor systems  <cit> . uninjured mice of both genotypes displayed similar maximum locomotor scores. we excluded the possibility that differences in axonal regeneration in gsk3β mice might be related to stimulation of astrocyte migration  <cit>  as the glial scar, assessed by the glial fibrillary acidic protein -negative area, remained similar between the two strains . these results show that partial reduction of gsk3β increases axonal growth following sci.

neuronal deletion of gsk3β promotes axonal regeneration in the cns
to avoid possible confounding effects of gsk3β depleted glia, we used mice with an inducible gsk3β neuronal deletion  generated by crossing gsk3βlox/lox  <cit>  with slick-h mice  under the control of the thy <dig> promoter)  <cit> . in these animals cre-positive neurons are yfp-positive. in the cre+gsk3βlox/lox mice, gsk3β was deleted in 97% of the yfp+ drg neurons , which represented 40% of all drg neurons. we did not observe any compensation by alterations in expression of the gsk3α isoform in the yfp+ cells of cre+gsk3βlox/lox mice . as expected, growth cones of gsk3β depleted neurons had residual levels of p-crmp- <dig> and p-map1b , probably accounted for by phosphorylation by alternative kinases.

in vitro, drg neurons from cre+gsk3βlox/lox mice had increased neurite outgrowth with more neurons extending longer neurites  . in vivo, after dorsal spinal cord hemisection, tracing with ct-b of yfp+ dorsal column fibers corroborated the in vitro findings, as cre+gsk3βlox/lox mice had a  <dig> -fold increased number of ct-b+/yfp+ axons entering the glial scar . moreover, the area of the lesion occupied by yfp+ axons was increased  <dig> -fold in cre+gsk3βlox/lox . since following dorsal hemisection all the dorsal column fibers were transected, ct-b+/yfp+ axons entering the glial scar reflect axonal regeneration. in the case of ct-b-/yfp+ axons, we cannot discard increased collateral sprouting arising from uninjured axons. we did not assess regeneration of raphespinal serotonergic axons as slick-h mice do not express cre recombinase in this tract. although unrelated to an in vivo regenerative effect of drg axons, after complete spinal cord transection, open field locomotor recovery was increased in cre+gsk3βlox/lox mice , further supporting that neuronal deletion of gsk3β promotes regeneration and/or sprouting of other tracts besides the dorsal column tract. uninjured mice of both genotypes displayed similar maximum locomotor scores. these data indicate that total deletion of gsk3β in neurons increases axonal regeneration in the cns within the glial scar.

decreased gsk3β activity leads to increased microtubule growth speed in the growth cone
to establish a causal effect between decreased gsk3β activity and altered microtubule dynamics in the growth cone, we measured microtubule growth speed in gsk3β drg neurons. gsk3β neurons had an increased microtubule growth speed in the growth cone  which correlated with an increased axonal growth as seen by extending the periods of imaging , similar to what was observed in conditioned drg neurons . with respect to the number of eb <dig> comets, no differences were observed . moreover, gsk3β neurons presented eb <dig> fluorescence located within a shorter distance from the growth cone tip , supporting an increased growth of microtubules into the peripheral domain of the growth cone. accordingly, a decreased ratio of acetylated /tyrosinated  microtubules in the growth cones of gsk3β neurons was found . in drg neurons from cre+gsk3βlox/lox mice, increased microtubule growth speed was present in the growth cone  and also correlated with increased axonal growth . moreover, cre+gsk3βlox/lox neurons also presented a decreased ratio of acetylated/tyrosinated microtubules . of note, whereas with gsk3β neurons eb3-gfp was used, with cre+ gsk3βlox/lox neurons eb3-mcherry was employed as cre+ neurons are yfp+. the differences in these constructs , might underlie the differences found among controls  for the parameters assessed. in summary, these results demonstrate that either partial reduction or total deletion of gsk3β increases microtubule dynamics in the growth cone that correlates with increased axon growth.

increased microtubule growth speed in the growth cone of gsk3β depleted neurons is related to decreased phosphorylation of crmp-2
to determine the mechanism underlying the effect of gsk3β in microtubule growth speed, we analyzed the role of key gsk3β substrates, namely map1b, clasp <dig> and crmp- <dig>  in drg neuron cultures, the high percentage of satellite cells and the low efficiency of nucleofection and transduction, preclude a straightforward comparison between endogenous and overexpressed protein levels. to allow the comparison of the relative expression of the different mutants analyzed, transfection  or transduction  of a neuronal cell line was performed and revealed similar levels of expression among different mutants .

phosphorylation of map1b by gsk3β increases microtubule dynamics in non-neuronal cells  <cit> . in neurons, overexpression of either wt map1b or of the phospho-resistant mutant st/aa-map1b had no significant impact in microtubule growth speed or in the ratio of acetylated/tyrosinated microtubules . however, the phospho-mimetic mutant st/dd-map1b increased microtubule growth speed and led to a decreased ratio of acetylated/tyrosinated microtubules . as such, p-map1b in neurons is sufficient but not necessary to increase microtubule dynamics, as in gsk3β depleted neurons, reduced levels of p-map1b  and increased microtubule growth speed co-exist.

clasp <dig> is a microtubule plus end-binding protein that when overexpressed in cos cells, promotes microtubule stabilization  <cit> . gsk3β phosphorylates clasp <dig> at multiple sites in the domain required for microtubule plus end tracking, disrupting clasp <dig> association with microtubules  <cit> . drg neurons overexpressing wt clasp <dig> had an increased ratio of acetylated/tyrosinated microtubules . viral transduction with clasp <dig> followed by transfection with eb <dig> rendered neurons unhealthy for subsequent analyses of microtubule growth speeds. the phospho-resistant mutant 9s/a-clasp <dig> promoted an increase in the ratio of acetylated/tyrosinated microtubules more pronounced than wt clasp <dig>  whereas the phospho-mimetic mutant 8s/d-clasp <dig> showed the weakest effect . these results agree with the function of clasp <dig> in promoting microtubule stability, which is inhibited by gsk3β phosphorylation. as such, the altered microtubule stability in gsk3β depleted neurons is unrelated to decreased p-clasp <dig>  suggesting that an alternative gsk3β substrate is responsible for this effect.

crmp- <dig> binds to tubulin heterodimers to promote microtubule assembly, thereby enhancing axon elongation, and its microtubule-binding activity is decreased upon gsk3β phosphorylation  <cit> . in neurons, overexpression of wt crmp- <dig> or of the phospho-resistant mutant t/a-crmp- <dig> led to increased microtubule growth speed , which was reversed by transfection with the phospho-mimetic mutant t/d-crmp- <dig> . moreover, overexpression of crmp- <dig> decreased the ratio of acetylated/tyrosinated microtubules; this effect being stronger when a phospho-resistant mutant  was used and less pronounced with the phospho-mimetic mutant t/d-crmp- <dig> . these results demonstrate that in neurons, the binding of crmp- <dig> to tubulin heterodimers in the growth cone controls the rate of microtubule assembly and that this effect is negatively regulated by gsk3β phosphorylation. moreover, overexpression of t/d-crmp- <dig> in cre+gsk3βlox/lox neurons reversed their increased microtubule growth speed , which correlated with a decreased axon growth  and a decreased ratio of acetylated/tyrosinated microtubules . combined, these results demonstrate that neuronal deletion of gsk3β alters the microtubule cytoskeleton in the growth cone, specifically by regulating the levels of p-crmp- <dig> 

inactivation of the gsk3β-crmp- <dig> pathway participates in the conditioning effect attenuating the growth repression mediated by cns inhibitors
in conditioned drg neurons, enhanced axonal growth and increased microtubule growth speed in the growth cone are present. at the molecular level, we determined that inhibition of gsk3β activity and decreased levels of p-crmp- <dig> occurred in this model. to further demonstrate that the gsk3β-crmp- <dig> pathway is critical for the conditioning effect, we transfected conditioned drg neurons with the phospho-mimetic mutant t/d-crmp- <dig>  overexpression of phospho-mimetic crmp- <dig> partially reversed the increased microtubule growth speed of conditioned neurons  and this effect correlated with a decrease in neurite outgrowth . a pronounced reversion of the conditioning effect was observed at the level of neurite formation as overexpression of t/d-crmp- <dig> in conditioned neurons led to a decrease in the percentage of cells with neurites to levels similar to those observed in naïve neurons . we next assessed whether reducing the levels of p-crmp- <dig> by overexpression of t/a-crmp- <dig> affected myelin-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth in naïve drg neurons. as expected, purified cns myelin decreased the growth of the longest drg neurite . interestingly, overexpression of phospho-resistant t/a-crmp- <dig> counteracted the inhibitory effect of myelin . together these results demonstrate that inactivation of the gsk3β-crmp- <dig> pathway participates in the conditioning effect overcoming the growth repression mediated by cns inhibitors.

discussion
a conditioning lesion reprograms neurons to a regenerative status. so far, none of the molecules identified as playing a role in this paradigm was shown to be sufficient and necessary to mimic the gain of axonal regenerative capacity elicited, probably as it is obtained through the combination of multiple components. as such, the quest for clinically relevant molecules that contribute to the conditioning lesion effect should be pursued. in this work, we show that the gsk3β-crmp- <dig> pathway participates in this paradigm, with decreased gsk3β activity and phospho-crmp- <dig> levels promoting axonal regeneration and attenuating the growth repression mediated by cns inhibitors. the effect of a conditioning lesion in increasing the microtubule growth speed is more robust than that of gsk3β deletion alone, which supports that other pathways might participate in this effect, as is the case in hdac <dig> activation  <cit> .

at the mechanistic level, we demonstrate that in vivo, both in wt animals and by blocking ser <dig> phosphorylation, gsk3β inhibition occurs through regulation of p-tyr <dig> levels. a dual mechanism for the regulation of phosphorylated gsk3βtyr <dig> is probably in place after sci, as increased specific phosphatase activity and decreased fyn kinase levels are observed in conditions of increased axonal growth. in contrast to our data, after nerve crush injury, both gsk3β p-ser <dig> and p-tyr <dig> have been reported to be increased both in ipsilateral and contralateral nerves, which causes difficulties in the interpretation of the results  <cit> . recently, regulation of axon regeneration through pi3k-gsk <dig> signaling, occurring through induction of smad <dig> expression, was shown to be specific in the soma but dispensable for local axon assembly in the distal axons. interestingly, this suggested the existence of upstream regulators responsible for modulating gsk <dig> signaling in growth cones of adult sensory neurons  <cit> . in this respect, we now show that regulation of p-gsk3βtyr <dig> levels, achieved by the dual action of upstream kinases and phosphatases, is a possible mechanism responsible for modulating gsk <dig> activity specifically in growth cones.

although several studies attempted to understand the role of gsk3β in axon growth and regeneration, as recently reviewed  <cit> , most of the reports used cultured neurons or neuronal cell lines, and semi-specific pharmacological inhibitors, yielding conflicting results ranging from promotion of axon growth to axon growth inhibition. some in vitro studies suggested that reduced gsk3β activity is required for axon formation, elongation or decreased retraction  <cit> , in a crmp-2-dependent mechanism  <cit> . accordingly, in vivo studies using gsk3β inhibitors showed increased axon regeneration following spinal cord injury  <cit> . supporting that in vivo gsk3β inactivation promotes axon regeneration, acutely blocking pi3k signaling or depleting smad <dig> in adult mice prevented sensory axon regeneration  <cit> . along the same line, other studies suggested that increased gsk3β activity leads to neurite retraction  <cit> . however, a second group of studies reported opposite effects supporting that increased gsk3β activity leads to increased axon elongation. in this respect, high phosphorylation of gsk <dig> targets  was shown to increase neurite elongation  <cit>  and pharmacological inhibition or small hairpin rna  blockage of gsk3β activity was reported to induce neurite retraction  <cit> , with participation of crmp- <dig> in the inhibitory effects  <cit> . the discrepancies in the literature were reconciled with the concept that the final outcome of gsk3β inhibition would depend on the extent of inhibition. in this paradigm, partial inactivation of gsk3β in the growth cone would lead to efficient axonal elongation, while strong inhibition would lead to suppression of kinase activity all along the axon, blocking axonal growth  <cit> . however, as recently suggested  <cit> , a complete understanding of the role of gsk3β in axon growth and regeneration required additional experimentation using in vivo genetic models, as was performed in the current work. here, we demonstrate that in vivo not only reduced gsk3β activity results in increased axon regeneration, but also, by using the cre+gsk3βlox/lox mice, we show that total ablation of gsk3β increases axonal regeneration, ruling out the need of a gsk3β gradient to enable axonal growth.

given the wide array of gsk3β substrates, several studies have probed the downstream molecular mechanism by which gsk3β controls axonal growth. as referred to above, one of the working models was that gsk3β activity should be precisely controlled so that activity towards one subset of substrates would be specifically blocked, while activity towards others would be preserved  <cit> . in this model, inhibition of gsk3β activity towards crmp- <dig> would allow its binding to microtubules promoting their polymerization, while maintenance of the activity towards map1b would maintain microtubules in a dynamic state, essential for axon growth. more recently, another model proposed clasps as the physiological target of gsk <dig> to exert control over axon growth  <cit> . in this model, promotion of axon growth occurred via moderate inhibition of gsk <dig> activity leading to the non-phosphorylation of some, but not all, gsk <dig> sites in clasps. this would allow clasps to specifically associate with microtubule plus ends promoting their stabilization  <cit> . both models required partial inhibition of gsk3β to promote axonal growth and regeneration. however, we demonstrate that total gsk3β inhibition promotes axonal growth in vivo with a concomitant increase in microtubule growth speed in the growth cone. in this context, we show that the effects of gsk3β deletion are not mediated by decreased p-clasp <dig> as in wt neurons, a non-phosphorylatable clasp <dig> mutant leads to increased microtubule stabilization. moreover, our results show that phosphorylation of map1b, although being sufficient to increase microtubule growth speed, is unnecessary for this effect. interestingly, after sci, increased levels of phosphorylated map1b have been reported in retraction bulbs of transected axons and in pre-apoptotic axotomized neuronal somata  <cit> . in our settings, overexpression of wt map1b did not influence microtubule growth speed. map1b was recently shown to interact with eb1/ <dig> and to sequester these proteins  <cit> . nevertheless, in that report, microtubule growth speed of map1b knockout hippocampal neurons was unaffected in the growth cone  <cit> . in drg neurons from map1b knockout mice, whereas no differences were found in the overall neurite length, higher branching and impaired growth cone turning were present  <cit> . these data suggest that rather than playing a role in neurite growth, map1b is important for growth cone turning and branch formation during plastic changes in the adult.

more importantly, our results show that crmp- <dig> is the primary downstream target of gsk3β that mediates the regulation of microtubule dynamics in the growth cone as demonstrated by reversion of increased microtubule growth speed of gsk3β-depleted neurons upon overexpression of a phospho-mimetic crmp- <dig> mutant. moreover, we demonstrate that the gsk3β-crmp- <dig> pathway participates in the conditioning lesion effect, as overexpression of the phospho-mimetic t/d-crmp- <dig> mutant partially reversed the increased microtubule growth speed of conditioned neurons leading to decreased axonal growth, and overexpression of the phospho-resistant t/a-crmp- <dig> mutant attenuated the inhibitory effect of myelin in naïve drg neurons. besides being phosphorylated by gsk3β at thr <dig>  <cit> , crmp- <dig> is also phosphorylated by rho-associated protein kinase  but at an alternative residue, thr <dig>  <cit> , downstream of both myelin-associated glycoprotein  and nogo- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, repulsive guidance molecule a  inhibits axon growth by inducing crmp- <dig> phosphorylation via both rock and gsk3β signaling  <cit> . however, in that study, details on which crmp- <dig> phosphorylation  was assessed are lacking, and gsk3β inhibition was performed in cultured neurons using a gsk3β antibody in the media and not a specific cell-permeable gsk3β inhibitor. taken together, our data demonstrate that, irrespective of rock-mediated crmp- <dig> phosphorylation at thr <dig>  inactivation of crmp- <dig> phosphorylation at thr <dig> by gsk3β is sufficient to reverse myelin inhibition in drg neuron cultures. our results point towards modulation of crmp- <dig> activity as a therapeutic target to induce axonal regeneration. further suggesting that crmp- <dig> is a central target to design strategies to achieve release of myelin inhibition, overexpression of the phospho-resistant mutant t555a-crmp- <dig>  counteracts the inhibitory effect of mag on postnatal cerebellar neurons  <cit> . additionally, protein phosphatase 2a promotes axonal growth by dephosphorylating crmp- <dig>  <cit> . the involvement of crmp- <dig> in several neurodegenerative diseases raised the need for developing therapeutic strategies targeting its functions. in this respect, drugs regulating crmp- <dig> levels and activity are currently being tested in the settings of neurodegeneration  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our work shows that microtubule dynamics in the growth cone are higher in conditions of increased axonal growth, such as after conditioning lesion. this alteration is achieved following inactivation of the gsk3β-crmp- <dig> pathway and is accompanied by enhanced axon regeneration through the glial scar. based on the present results, studying the effect of crmp-2-specific drugs, capable of modulating its activity, should be further developed in sci and in other conditions where axonal regeneration needs to be promoted.
