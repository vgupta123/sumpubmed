BACKGROUND
b. thuringiensis, belonging to the bacillus cereus sensu lato group, is a gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium that produces parasporal crystals during sporulation. the proteinaceous parasporal crystals show toxicity against insect larvae. the toxin protein genes, usually insecticidal crystal protein  genes, are mainly located on large conjugative plasmids  <cit> .

b. thuringiensis strains appear to contain plasmid dna in proportion of 10–20% of total cell dna  <cit> . generally, plasmids of different b. thuringiensis strains vary in number and size, with the number between 1– <dig> and the size from  <dig> to >  <dig> kb  <cit> . in addition to harboring icp genes, b. thuringiensis plasmids can also bear insertion sequences and transposons that are commonly associated with crystal protein genes  <cit> , or biosynthesis genes of the heat-stable toxin thuringiensin  <cit> .

these plasmids consist of two groups:  the small plasmids , which perform rolling-circle replication  using a single-stranded  intermediate  <cit> , and  the large plasmids that normally follow a theta-replicating mode  <cit> . theta replicons are currently divided into six groups   <cit> . although there have been relatively few studies focusing on the characterization of gram-positive theta replicons, as opposed to their gram-negative counterparts, plasmids pertaining to the broad-host-range pamβ <dig> family  have been mostly studied from gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . to date, only four plasmids from the b. cereus group have been analyzed and reported to belong to the pamβ <dig> family. of these, p <dig>  comes from b. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki hd <dig>  and a  <dig>  bp replication region of p <dig> has been cloned  <cit> . the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid paw <dig>  has been isolated from b. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki hd <dig>  and a  <dig>  kb replicon of paw <dig> has been characterized  <cit> . pbt <dig>  is the sole plasmid in the pathogenic strain b. thuringiensis subsp. konkukian 97- <dig>  and its replication protein and the predicted origin have been analyzed by sequence comparison  <cit> . pxo <dig>  is the second virulence plasmid of bacillus anthracis, and a  <dig>  bp replication region has been identified  <cit> .

in this study, a dna fragment was shown to contain a plasmid replicon capable of supporting replication and maintaining stability in b. thuringiensis. the location of this replicon was identified as being on pbmb <dig>  the largest detected plasmid  from b. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis ybt- <dig>  sequence analysis revealed that the replicon of pbmb <dig> shared significant homology to the replicons of pamβ <dig> family plasmids, suggesting that pbmb <dig> also belongs to this plasmid family. moreover, the characterization of the replicon region of pbmb <dig> provided additional information on the evidence of genetic exchange, molecular evolution and distribution of these closely related plasmids in their various isolates of origin.

RESULTS
isolation and localization of a plasmid replicon from ybt-1765
the total plasmid dna of ybt- <dig> was digested by ecori. after gel electrophoresis, 2– <dig> kb fragments were separately excised from the gel and purified by dna gel extraction. the purified plasmid fragments were then cloned separately into the ecori site of the replicon cloning vector pdg <dig>  the resulting recombinant plasmids were electroporated into b. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki plasmid-cured strain bmb <dig>  only one kmr transformant was selected and contained a recombinant plasmid designated pbmb <dig> , and then the recombinant plasmid pbmb <dig> was introduced into the cacl2-treated e. coli competent cell for further sequence analysis. on the basis of the above result, it was therefore believed that a plasmid replicon was located within the cloned  <dig> kb ecori fragment. to identify the plasmid harboring the  <dig> kb ecori replication fragment, a southern blot experiment was performed, in which the  <dig> kb ecori fragment of pbmb <dig> was used as probe. the result showed that this replication fragment was located on the largest plasmid detected in ybt- <dig>  named pbmb <dig> .

identification and characterization of the minireplicon
to further pinpoint the location of the pbmb <dig> minireplicon, a series of deletion derivatives was constructed and tested for replication in b. thuringiensis . six of the resulting plasmids, pbmb <dig> , pbmb <dig> , pbmb <dig> , pbmb165-f4a , pbmb165-f5c  and pbmb165-f6a , were able to replicate in b. thuringiensis. in contrast, the three other derivative plasmids pbmb <dig> , pbmb <dig>  and pbmb <dig>  were unable to give rise to recombinant b. thuringiensis .

consequently, the pbmb <dig> mini-replicon  was reduced to a  <dig>  kb fragment with a single intact orf, orf <dig>  encoding a 518-amino acids  rep protein . furthermore, a  <dig> bp fragment  was deleted by pcr amplification with the primer pair orf5- <dig> and orf5- <dig>  which led the rep <dig> protein to be truncated ; and the corresponding construct pbmb165-f1b was unable to replicate in b. thuringiensis .

amino acid sequence comparison showed that rep <dig> displayed similarity to the rep proteins of the pamβ <dig> family of theta-replicating plasmids, such as rep of pbt <dig> , rep63a of paw <dig>  and rep of p <dig>  from b. thuringiensis  <cit> , reps of pxo <dig>  from b. anthracis  <cit> , repe of pamβ <dig>  from enterococcus faecalis  <cit> , repr of pip <dig>  from streptococcus agalactiae  <cit>  and reps of psm <dig>  from streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> .

in addition, the minireplicon of pbmb <dig> was found to carry two cis-functioning regions. one cis-functioning region, located immediately downstream of rep <dig>  displayed significant similarity to the cis-functioning origin of replication harbored in the corresponding locus of the pamβ <dig> family plasmids cited above . moreover, a derivative of pbmb165-f5c , in which only a  <dig> bp stretch remains of the original sequence located immediately downstream of rep <dig> , lost the ability to replicate in b. thuringiensis . based on the above observations, it can be concluded that this region carries the ori sequence  of pbmb <dig> 

taken together, the conservation among these rep proteins and ori regions thus provided significant evidence that pbmb <dig> belongs to the pamβ <dig> family of gram-positive theta-replicating plasmids.

the other cis-functioning region was constituted of iterons. these are sets of repeated dna sequences that have been reported to serve as a binding site for the replication initiation protein and thus to play an important role in the replication and/or the control of replication in other theta-replicating plasmids  <cit> . in pbmb <dig>  a set of  <dig> bp with the consensus sequence at  gtgtaa was found repeated  <dig> times in the direct orientation and  <dig> times in reverse orientation, upstream of rep <dig> and immediately adjacent to orf <dig>  another three repeats were located downstream of orf <dig>  the repeat sets were well conserved among pbmb <dig>  pbt <dig> and pxo <dig>  although their reiterations were different, whereas they lacked any sequence homology to iterons from paw <dig> . it is noteworthy though that the iteron region was located in the equivalent loci on pbmb <dig>  pxo <dig> and pbt <dig>  as well as on the paw <dig> replicon . in addition, there were two conserved at-rich dna regions in the vicinity of the iterons sequences of pbmb <dig>  pbt <dig>  pxo <dig> and paw <dig> .

to assess the involvement of these iterons in the replication of pbmb <dig>  a deletion experiment was performed. the results obtained with pbmb165-f6b, which lacked the iterons, suggested that these repeated sequences are required for replication . in contrast, the iterons sequences present upstream of rep from pamβ <dig> have been shown to be non-essential to pamβ <dig> replication  <cit> .

orf <dig> and orf <dig> are required for plasmid stability
as shown in fig.  <dig>  the recombinant plasmid pbmb <dig> and its derivatives pbmb <dig>  pbmb <dig>  pbmb <dig>  pbmb165-f4a, pbmb165-f5c and pbmb165-f6a were unable to be properly maintained  in b. thuringiensis bmb <dig>  this result showed that the  <dig> kb ecori replication fragment harbored only the factors required for replication and lacked some elements necessary for retaining plasmid stability.

to investigate the missing elements, a random ybt- <dig> plasmid library was constructed by inserting bamhi-partially digested plasmid dna from ybt- <dig> into the vector pbelobac <dig>  in this small library, a recombinant plasmid, designated pbmb165b <dig>  contained a  <dig> kb insert consisting of two bamhi fragments of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb; and further sequence analysis revealed that the  <dig> kb ecori replication region was located on the  <dig> kb bamhi fragment .

at the 3' end of this  <dig> kb fragment cloned from pbmb <dig>  there were two intact overlapping putative orfs, named orf <dig> and orf <dig> , respectively. the same structural organization was also found in the corresponding location  of plasmids pbt <dig> , pxo <dig>  and paw <dig>  .

orf <dig> from pbmb <dig> shared sequence similarity with orf <dig>  from pbt <dig> and repb  from pxo <dig>  as well as copy control protein repb  from the e. faecalis plasmid pad <dig>  <cit> . but while it resembled rep63b  from paw <dig> in terms of location and size, they did not share any significant sequence similarity. these proteins, including rep63b, were all shown to have conserved atpase motif of para protein involved in chromosome or plasmid partitioning.

likewise, orf <dig> from pbmb <dig> displayed similarity to orf <dig> from pbt <dig>  and orf <dig> from pxo <dig> , and although their predicted protein products did not display any sequence similarity to other known proteins, their size and location matched those of repc, a protein involved in the stability of pad <dig>  <cit> , as did those of orf <dig> from paw <dig> 

in order to conclusively identify the region responsible for the plasmid stability, the recombinant plasmid pbmb165-f6d , and its derivatives pbmb165-f6e  and pbmb165-f6g  were constructed. the pbmb165-f6d construct was found to be highly stable in b. thuringiensis , whereas pbmb165-f6e and pbmb165-f6g were not , suggesting that orf <dig> and orf <dig> were both essential for plasmid stability.

interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that repb of pxo <dig> is not required for replication  <cit> . while in contrast, rep63b of paw <dig> has previously been found to be indispensable for replication  <cit> . in this study, orf <dig> and orf <dig> were not essential for replication, but they were important for the stable maintenance of pbmb <dig>  this result was consistent with previous observations on repb and repc of the e. faecalis plasmid pad <dig>  which is a member of another family of theta-replicating plasmids . nevertheless, the mechanism by which orf <dig> and orf <dig> contribute to plasmid stability control remains unclear.

transposable elements or their remnants
three orfs  were found encoding putative transposases in the vicinity of rep <dig> . an is231-like element was identified downstream of rep <dig> and named is231u. it harbored a single open reading frame encoding a 477-aa transposase  that displayed highest similarity to the transposases of is231o-q and f .

intriguingly, orf <dig>  and a downstream  <dig> bp sequence were similar to the transposase  and right-side ir of several class ii transposons from the b. cereus group, such as tnxo <dig>  from b. anthracis pxo <dig>  tn <dig>  and tn <dig>  from b. thuringiensis  <cit> , as well as of an unnamed transposon from pbtoxis  and a novel transposon  from the b. thuringiensis subsp.pakistani strain t <dig>  . these sequence features may be the transposase and right-side ir of a remnant class ii transposon . furthermore, the is231u described above had inserted just before the last bp  of this proposed ir, a peculiar structural association also seen in the case of is231a insertion within tn <dig>  <cit> , is231f within tnbtoxis and is231l within tnbt <dig>  <cit> .

another intact transposable element, designated isbth <dig> was found upstream of rep <dig>  isbth <dig> contained a 289-aa putative transposase  that displayed similarity with putative transposases from various bacterial species. it was tentatively grouped into the is <dig> family of transposable elements  <cit> . it is particularly interesting to note that the replication control center of pbmb <dig> is divided into two parts by isbth <dig> : one part harboring rep <dig> and ori <dig>  the other containing the iterons region and the two proposed stability-control elements . surprisingly, the presence of isbth <dig> in the intervening region between rep <dig> and orf <dig> apparently has little or no disruptive effect on the function of these replication-related factors . an experiment involving the interruption of orf <dig>  showed that it was not implicated in plasmid replication .

finally, upstream of the replication region were two additional insertion sequences, designated isbth <dig>  and isbth <dig> , that were tentatively classified as belonging to the is <dig> and is <dig> family of transposable elements  <cit> , respectively, on the basis of their sequence similarities.

other orfs
in addition to the replication/stability-related and transposable features, other elements were found in this cloned fragment. downstream of the rep <dig> gene, an open reading frame  encoding a 250-aa hypothetical protein  of unknown function displayed similarities with orfs found in pbt <dig>  pxo <dig> and paw <dig> in equivalent locations .

the segment of pbmb <dig> spanning from orf <dig> to orf <dig>  flanked on either side by transposable elements, was found to be remarkably similar to a corresponding segment on pbtoxis . none of the sequences involved were found in pbt <dig>  pxo <dig> and paw <dig> . based on their similarities, several of the genes carried by these segments were related to sporulation genes  <cit> . orf <dig> of pbmb <dig> and pbt <dig> of pbtoxis were homologous to a putative spore coat-associated protein from bacillus. orf <dig> of pbmb <dig> and pbt <dig> of pbtoxis were homologous to the regulatory protein abrb, which has been shown in b. subtilis to regulate sporulation  <cit> , as well as being involved in an important example of chromosome-plasmid crosstalk in the b. cereus group  <cit> . orf <dig> of pbmb <dig> and pbt <dig> of pbtoxis were homologous to members of the transcriptional regulator arsr family.

sequence variability in the pamβ <dig> family replicons
the pamβ <dig> family replicons that have so far been identified from the b. cereus group  have been shown to share the same organization ; however, this organization scheme is distinctly different from the one found in the pamβ <dig> family replicons that are of enterococcal  or streptococcal  origin . the genetic divergence that led to the establishment of these two types of replicon apparently affected all the components upstream of the rep gene, including the iteron region and the stability-control genes of plasmids. it is of significant interest that the same organization of stability-associated genes found upstream of the rep genes in the b. cereus group replicons is also present in the group f family of theta-replicating plasmids  which includes, most notably, plasmids pad <dig> and pcf <dig>  <cit>  from e. faecalis. it would therefore seem reasonable to speculate that a genetic exchange between the theta replicons of the group d family  and those of the group f family may have been responsible for the evolution of the peculiar pamβ <dig> family replicons found in the b. cereus group. for these reasons, we proposed that the pamβ <dig> family replicons should be divided into two subfamilies with those from the b. cereus group forming a subfamily of their own.

the detailed sequence analysis performed on the pamβ <dig> family replicons of the b. cereus group also showed that the iterons region and the two overlapping plasmid stability-associated genes constituted the highest source of sequence variability among these plasmid replicons, and that the major divergence from the general consensus was seen in the replicon of paw <dig>  a result consistent with the recent report of van der auwera et al.  <cit>  which also suggested that these iterons region may act as recombination nodes participating in genetic plasticity.

CONCLUSIONS
the mini-replicon of pbmb <dig> from b. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis ybt- <dig> was determined. this study demonstrated that the determinants rep <dig>  ori <dig> and the iterons region are indispensable for plasmid replication; and that orf <dig> and orf <dig> are involved in stable maintenance of the plasmid.

the exploration of sequence conservation among the pamβ <dig> family replicons led to the suggestion that the pamβ <dig> family replicons from the b. cereus group should be grouped into a subfamily that may have diverged mainly in the iterons and stability control regions. comparative sequence analysis of additional such replicons may yield further insight into the genetic relationship of these divergent groups.
