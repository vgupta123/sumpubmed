BACKGROUND
the evolution of life-history traits in different lineages is a major question in the field of evolutionary biology  <cit> , especially because traits may drive the speciation process  <cit> . indeed, niche-related traits, for example, could diverge, producing reproductive isolation between two populations. as a result, this leads to ecological speciation. coevolution is another interesting topic that determines the process of evolutionary change in a trait triggered by other trait in a lineage. trait evolution among lineages could occur through reciprocal evolution between interacting species, driven by natural selection  <cit> .

analyses of character evolutionary history, such as ancestral state reconstruction  and stochastic character mapping  <cit> , are powerful methods for studying the origin and maintenance of phenotypic diversity  <cit> . moreover, the analysis of character associations may provide important clues regarding the coevolution between life-history traits  <cit> . the bayesian approach to investigating patterns of ancestral states is considered a more powerful method compared to other methods, such as parsimony. parsimony is unable to consider more than a single change along the branch on a cladogram and cannot couple with evolutionary time and amount of character change  <cit> .

in amphibians, the evolution of reproductive features is still not completely understood due to the remarkable diversity of lifestyles, from purely aquatic to arboreal and fossorial  <cit> . anuran reproductive features are classified by reproductive modes based on oviposition, development, stage and size of hatchling, and parental care  <cit> . each reproductive mode classification in frogs is assigned a number according to the dependence on water for reproduction. for instance, mode number  <dig> is associated with frogs that deposit their eggs in water where exotrophic tadpoles develop. frogs presenting reproductive mode number  <dig> lay eggs in excavated nests where tadpoles live in early stages and subsequently complete their development in ponds or streams. direct development frogs present reproductive mode number  <dig> .

shifts from aquatic to terrestrial breeding have occurred repeatedly and independently in many vertebrates  <cit> . traditional knowledge claims that the evolution of terrestrial reproduction in anurans occurred from ancestors that bred in water  <cit> , especially because the aquatic mode is the most representative of exotrophic tadpoles  <cit>  and was probably the ancestral state for anurans  <cit> . in addition, the existence of intermediate stages of water dependency, such as species that lay eggs close to water  instead of inside bodies of water, supports the hypothesis of an ordered and gradual evolution in the direction of a more terrestrial reproduction  <cit> . nonetheless, gomez-mestre et al.  <cit>  has recently challenged this conventional view by demonstrating the lack of intermediate stages in some groups, as well as the evolution of direct development from both terrestrial and aquatic reproductive modes.

in addition, changes between aquatic and terrestrial breeding may occur in conjunction with modifications of morphological and other ecological features  <cit> , providing opportunities for coevolution between traits. even though reproductive modes are frequently studied, the only well-known associations that are commonly tested show:  negative correlations between ovum and clutch size ;  positive correlations between ovum size and hatchling dimensions; and  positive correlations between clutch volume, egg size and female body size within a given reproductive mode . under a cladistic perspective, a recent study shed light on some unexplored associations, such as the correlation of terrestrial reproduction with reduced clutch and adult size, and with parental care  <cit> . however, little is known about other traits that may be correlated with reproductive modes, such as tadpole and adult morphological characteristics, with the exception of body size.

amphibian systematics has undergone pronounced changes over the past decade . the genus leptodactylus, the most diverse of the leptodactylidae, contains  <dig> species distributed throughout north america , as well as central and south america. formerly, the genus was assembled in five groups based on behavioral, morphological and ecological features  <cit> : the leptodactylus ocellatus group, now referred to as the l. latrans group  <cit> , the l. melanonotus group, the l. pentadactylus group, the l. fuscus group and the l. marmoratus group. however, since heyer’s  <cit>  suggestion that the group leptodactylus marmoratus was not closely related to the other groups, the phylogenetic position of the group has been discussed, leading to its placement in a different genus, adenomera  <cit> . recent molecular data confirm adenomera as a natural group with a single common ancestor  <cit> . distributed throughout almost all of south america, the genus is currently comprised of  <dig> species. this number is known to be underestimated, however, due to the occurrence of cryptic species  <cit> .

leptodactylus and adenomera  are good models for understanding the patterns and processes of the evolutionary history of reproductive traits. these foam-nesting species present at least four different reproductive modes, varying in oviposition and biology of the larvae. the diversity of reproductive modes for leptodactylus and adenomera, as well as its association with species in the phenetic groups of leptodactylus and in the adenomera, has led to the prediction of a gradual evolutionary tendency of evolutionary lineages, from a more aquatic to a more terrestrial breeding. this also suggests the presence of obligatory intermediate stages of water dependence to reproduction. heyer  <cit>  hypothesized that the leptodactylus melanonotus and l. latrans groups had the most primitive reproductive modes, with higher water reliance . the leptodactylus pentadactylus group would represent the first step towards terrestriality, with eggs placed in the water accumulated in basins constructed by males , followed by the l. fuscus group, in which eggs are placed inside subterranean chambers that are also constructed by males . finally, adenomera  would represent the most derived reproductive mode, with a lower dependency on water for reproduction, since some species are known to have endotrophic tadpole development in subterranean chambers constructed by males . however, heyer  <cit>  suggested that adenomera was an independent lineage, and postulated that the evolutionary shift to terrestrial reproduction in leptodactylines occurred twice, once in the leptodactylus ancestor and another in the adenomera ancestor. although this hypothesis of a gradual increase of terrestriality in some leptodactylinae frogs has never being tested, it has repeatedly been cited in the literature . recently, some authors have raised questions concerning this hypothesis  <cit> .figure  <dig> schematic drawings representing known reproductive modes in leptodactylinae. mode  <dig> includes species that produce floating foam nests in ponds with exotrophic tadpoles; mode  <dig> also presents exotrophic tadpoles, but with foam nests placed in water accumulated in constructed basins; mode  <dig> groups species that have foam nests that are placed inside a subterranean chamber and after a period of development, the tadpoles float to the bodies of water; mode  <dig> is the most terrestrial one, with endotrophic tadpoles . illustrated by vinícius yano.



here, we studied the evolution of life-history traits among leptodactylinae lineages by reconstructing ancestral states, mapping character changes and testing the correlation among six characteristics. in this study, we tested:  the hypothesis of the tendency towards terrestriality, with shifts from aquatic to terrestrial breeding and the existence of obligatory intermediate stages; and  the association between reproductive modes and morphological and ecological features that are potentially related to water dependency.

RESULTS
phylogeny estimation
the combined dataset alignment consisted of a fragment of  <dig>  base pairs . the third codon position of cytb was excluded from the final alignment due to high saturation . some hypervariable regions with several indels were excluded from the 12s and 16s sequences because of the ambiguous alignments they generated. for both the 12s and 16s datasets, the best evolutionary model was gtr+i+g, whereas for the cytb fragment, it was tim2+i+g. finally, for the rhod fragment, the best evolutionary model was tpm3uf+i+g .table  <dig>

the bayesian analysis resulted in a monophyletic and highly supported adenomera clade with lithodytes lineatus as a sister species . adenomera heyeri and a. lutzi comprises a sister clade of all other adenomera species sampled. the leptodactylus species also formed a highly supported monophyletic group, subdivided into two major clades .figure  <dig> phylogenetic relationships among leptodactylinae, based on the 50% majority rule consensus cladogram reconstructed using the bayesian analysis. numbers inside squares represent clade numbers. numbers above nodes are clade posteriori probability, and below nodes are bootstrap supports for the maximum parsimony analysis. a: adenomera saci ; b: leptodactylus fuscus ; c: l. labyrinthicus ; d: l. podicipinus ; and e: l. latrans . photos: a, pedro peloso, b and d, ariovaldo giaretta, and c and e, antonio sebben.



the maximum parsimony analyses produced  <dig> of the most parsimonious trees with  <dig>  steps. the strict consensus tree had  <dig>  steps  and also showed lithodytes lineatus as a sister species to the monophyletic genus adenomera. the parsimony analyses generated a consensus tree similar to the bayesian analysis, but also presented some polytomies.

ancestral state reconstruction, character mapping, and correlation
the bayesian character state reconstruction indicated that reproductive mode  <dig>  in which eggs are placed in floating foam nests directly on the top of water, was the most probable ancestral state of the most recent common ancestor of leptodactylinae . this reproductive mode was also the inferred ancestral state of lithodytes + adenomera  and of leptodactylus . while reproductive mode  <dig> had one origin, modes  <dig> and  <dig> originated twice and mode  <dig> originated at least three times . reproductive mode  <dig> is characterized by the deposition of foam nests on water that has accumulated in a constructed basin. in mode  <dig>  parents produce foam nests where eggs and early larval stages develop in subterranean constructed nests. subsequently, exotrophic tadpoles finish their development in ponds. similar to mode  <dig>  species with reproductive mode  <dig> reproduce in subterranean constructed chambers. however, the endotrophic tadpoles complete their development in a nest.figure  <dig> ancestral state representation of six life-history traits reconstructed for  <dig> leptodactylinae species using stochastic inferences. pie charts indicate the probability of each character state. clade numbers are indicated at the nodes  of the bayesian cladogram . only the ancestral state probability of the clades in the 50% majority-rule consensus cladogram reconstructed using bayesian analysis are indicated here. see additional file  <dig> for the probability of each character state in each possible clade, as pointed out by the bayesian analysis. a: adenomera genus; b: leptodactylus fuscus group; c: l. pentadactylus group; d: l. melanonotus group; and e: l. latrans group.



in addition, the analysis showed that transitions from aquatic to terrestrial  reproductive modes have occurred at least four times in leptodactylinae: 1) a shift from mode  <dig> to modes  <dig> or  <dig> in the ancestral adenomera ; 2) a shift from mode  <dig> to  <dig> in some adenomera species ; 3) a shift from mode  <dig> to  <dig> in some leptodactylus ancestral ; and a shift from  <dig> to  <dig> in two species of the l. melanonotus group . moreover, transitions from terrestrial to aquatic  reproductive modes were also found: 1) a shift from mode  <dig> to  <dig> in some adenomera species ; and 2) a shift from mode  <dig> to  <dig> in species of the leptodactylus pentadactylus group . besides those, transformation direction in node  <dig> was uncertain because it had equal probability for reproductive modes  <dig> and  <dig> . thus, the reproductive mode may have changed from  <dig> to  <dig> in node  <dig> or from  <dig> to  <dig> in node  <dig> .

while clutch size, tadpole environment, nuptial spines and egg pigmentations presented a clear evolutionary pattern with few independent origins of states , multiple reversals between ‘open areas’ and ‘forest formations’ were found by the habitat reconstruction. the most recent common ancestor of adenomera and lithodytes  produced less than  <dig> eggs per clutch and lacked nuptial spines and melanin on eggs, while the leptodactylus most recent common ancestor  had large clutch sizes, tadpoles in lentic water bodies, presence of nuptial spines and the absence of egg pigmentation.

the character mapping analysis retrieved the estimated number of changes in the ancestral nodes, together with the probable transformations along the branches . the habitat had the highest expected number of changes , being almost the same number from one state to another. the reproductive mode had  <dig> changes, most of them between modes  <dig> to  <dig>  however, nuptial spine presented the lowest number of transformations .table  <dig>

discussion
ancestral state reconstruction
our results showed that the evolution of reproductive modes in leptodactylinae did not follow a linear trend, as heyer  <cit>  predicted, and it did not necessarily happen through intermediate stages, as mcdiarmid  <cit>  suggested. other interesting facts demonstrated here include the monophyletic independent sister lineages of adenomera and leptodactylus  <cit>  and the independent origins of less aquatic modes, occurring in the ancestors of both genus, as suggested by heyer  <cit> .

moreover, we found no indication of a gradual evolution of reproductive traits towards terrestriality through the lineages. transitions were found from the most aquatic mode  to the semi-aquatic mode  and to the terrestrial mode  – both consists in eggs in foam nests deposited in burrows, but while in the first the tadpoles are carried by water to the water body, in the second the tadpoles develops entirely into the burrow. this same situation was demonstrated for other terrestrial modes of reproduction in anurans  <cit> . this shift from mode  <dig> to  <dig> may have happened two times: 1) from the leptodactylus genus ancestor to the ancestor of the l. fuscus and l. pentadactylus groups; and 2) from the lithodytes and adenomera ancestor to the most recent common ancestor of the latter genus. in this last case, even with the confident phylogenetic position of lithodytes lineatus , there is still uncertainty about its ancestor state . its breeding site is uncommon in the leptodactylinae species, with the parent laying eggs in foam nests inside ant nests. besides, it is not clear whether or not the tadpoles subsequently complete their development in temporary water bodies. this reproductive mode does not fit any of those previously assigned to the subfamily.

the absence of a linear evolution from aquatic to terrestrial reproductive modes is confirmed by reversions from mode  <dig> – eggs in foam nests inside burrows and tadpoles subsequently carried to the water body - to mode  <dig> – eggs in foam nests in constructed basins near the water – and also from mode  <dig> – eggs in foam nests and complete development of the tadpoles inside burrows - to mode  <dig> . reversions from terrestrial to aquatic reproductive modes have also been demonstrated in other anuran groups  <cit> . also, the character mapping analysis showed that these transitions occurred not only at the most recent common hypothetic ancestor , but also along the branches. the transitions from a more terrestrial breeding mode to one that is less-so can also be observed by summing up the expected number of transformations in this direction and comparing them to the transformations from aquatic to terrestrial breeding . both presented nearly  <dig> transformations, showing that terrestrial egg laying is not necessarily an evolutionary tendency, but is actually an alternative strategy with no implied directionality.

the analysis of ancestral state reconstruction of clutch size also showed evidence of a clear pattern among lineages. the ancestral state of the leptodactylus species suggested the oviposition of more than  <dig>  eggs per clutch, while adenomera had less than  <dig> eggs . even though a reversion was found from in adenomera from the reproductive mode which tadpoles develops inside the burrows  to the mode that tadpoles are carried from the burrow to the water body , the hypothetical ancestral state holds the oviposition of few eggs. it is unlikely that the exotrophic adenomera tadpoles simply float to the water bodies by chance , because they have functional mouthparts and spiracles  <cit> , implying that they need nourishment provided from the environment to complete their metamorphoses. endotrophic tadpoles do not have mouthparts or spiracles, as they use only the yolk provided by their parents for their development.

character mapping and correlations
a clear association pattern between clutch size and reproductive mode was found, as predicted by heyer  <cit>  and previously demonstrated for many anuran genera  <cit> . the higher dependence on water, which is a more unpredictable environment when compared to a burrow, together with no parental care, favors r-strategists, which may allocate energy to increase the number of eggs per clutch. conversely, species with a low dependency on water, in this case, egg-burrowing species, may allocate energy to parental care  <cit> . the correlation analyses showed that the ancestral state of leptodactylus and adenomera species presents both kinds of reproductive strategies, with the first favoring productivity, and the other favoring parental care.

the construction of the subterranean chambers by males of the leptodactylus fuscus group and the adenomera species is considered a type of parental care, with the parents providing a more suitable microhabitat for offspring development  <cit> . when compared to water environments, subterranean chambers increase the chance of offspring survivorship by reducing predation, desiccation and interspecific competition  <cit> . egg-burrowing species have a limitation regarding the number of eggs due to both the amount of energy spent in the burrow construction, and the limited space inside the chamber  <cit> . thus, space may be an important constraint, since terrestriality in anurans demands increased amounts of yolk to feed the endotrophic tadpoles, consequently increasing egg dimensions  <cit> . the amount of yolk needed in the reproductive mode which tadpoles complete the development inside the burrow  is higher than in mode in which they are carried to the water , because in the first case the tadpole completes the development exclusively using yolk as an energy source. conversely, species with mode  <dig> only depend on the yolk for a brief period of tadpole development, which may lead to contrasting correlations of modes  <dig> and  <dig> and clutch sizes. an opposite relationship was noticed in the more aquatic reproductive mode, with tadpoles using external sources of energy from the beginning of development, leading to a smaller egg dimension and larger clutch size, and consequently, to a correlation of egg size and oviposition.

we found no evidence of a clear association with the phylogenetic hypothesis of leptodactylinae and evolution in their habitat usage , especially since this trait presented the highest number of expected transformations and no significant correlations with reproductive modes. the correlations provide no evidence to support the hypothesis that the evolution of terrestrial breeding is linked to forest habitats due to the high humidity  <cit> . however, air humidity may not limit the development of leptodactylinae because the foam nest may protect eggs from desiccation. although we are aware that the lack of correlation and the high number of transformations may be a consequence of the small number of categories , there is not enough data available to be more specific about the habitat that these species use.

environmental filters seem to have been decisive for the evolution of tadpole environment in leptodactylus, since all species shared the same state: lentic water bodies. this tadpole environment appears in leptodactylinae during almost 70% of the lineage reconstructions . species with aquatic reproduction that involves placing eggs in lentic environments have an adaptive advantage when compared to those that use lotic water bodies because lentic waters facilitate the amplexus, providing a sheltered environment for eggs and the tadpole’s first stage of development, in addition to keeping the nest integrity. consequently, the reproductive modes more related to aquatic breeding  are negatively correlated with lotic water bodies.

our results showed similar evolutionary histories for nuptial spines and egg pigmentation. the presence or absence of these structures occurred together in almost the same species and ancestral nodes, with two major exceptions: the ancestor of leptodactylus and the l. pentadactylus group. both lacked egg pigmentation but had nuptial spines, which help the male anchor to the female. the presence of nuptial spines in leptodactylus’ ancestors was maintained in the ancestors of the leptodactylus latrans and l. melanonotus groups, including l. discodactylus, but is now associated with the presence of melanin on eggs. although leptodactylus discodactylus has not been assigned to any phenetic groups yet, our results suggest that it belongs to the l. melanonotus group . the ancestral state of the leptodactylus pentadactylus group, which had nuptial spines but lacked melanin on eggs, corroborates heyer’s  <cit>  hypothesis. he stated that the presence of spines in the leptodactylus pentadactylus group has evolved because of the large adult body size of this species rather than because of the water dependence.

the species in this group do not place eggs directly in a main body of water. spines are used to facilitate the amplexus between large specimens where eggs are placed in water accumulated in basins constructed by males. the lack of egg pigmentation in the group’s ancestors, which is only needed in eggs exposed to ultraviolet light, also supports heyer’s hypothesis. nevertheless, we found a positive correlation between mode  <dig> , which is common among the leptodactylus pentadactylus group and some species of the leptodactylus melanonotus group, and egg pigmentation. this could be associated with the ability of species in the leptodactylus pentadactylus and leptodactylus melanonotus groups to construct basins where eggs are spawned  <cit> . in many cases, the eggs are exposed to ultraviolet light, and the egg pigmentation helps protect against embryo damage. the correlation analysis also confirmed the association between the presence of spines and egg pigmentation with the more aquatic reproductive mode  and a negative correlation with the more terrestrial breeding .

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed no evidence of an evolutionary tendency toward terrestriality in leptodactylinae. indeed, we found reversals from terrestrial to aquatic tadpole development and no evidence of mandatory intermediate stages. in addition, we also found correlations between morphological and ecological traits driven by water dependence. aquatic reproductive modes are associated with higher clutch sizes, lentic waters, and the presence of nuptial spines and egg pigmentation. no correlation was found between reproductive modes and habitat usage, where multiple reversals of ancestors and descendants living in open and forested areas were found. the robustness of the phylogenetic hypothesis, which confirmed adenomera and leptodactylus monophyly and lithodytes as a sister taxon of adenomera, enabled the study of reproductive trait evolution. furthermore, the present study reinforces the usefulness and power of bayesian stochastic character mapping to better understand the evolution of life history traits.
