BACKGROUND
in recent years, genome-wide association studies  have successfully uncovered single-nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with complex diseases or traits  <cit> . with the rapid development of chip array-based genotyping techniques, thousands of genomic submicroscopic structural variations have been found in the human genome  <cit> . as a main genetic form of submicroscopic structural variation copy number variations  are widely distributed in the human genome and influence gene expression, phenotypic variation and adaptation by disrupting genes and altering gene dosage  <cit> . numerous studies showed that cnvs contributed to both disease susceptibility and phenotypic diversity  <cit> . now, cnv is increasingly considered to be an important and abundant source of genetic variation and phenotypic diversity  <cit> .

investigations on cnvs have been successively carried out in human and other species  <cit> . in the domestic animals, there are involving in cattle  <cit> , dog  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , pig  <cit> , goat  <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and rabbit  <cit> . as for sheep, fontanesi et al.  <cit>  provided a first comparative map of cnvs of the sheep genome referred to the cattle genome using a cross-species array comparative genome hybridization. however, the cross-species analysis based on heterologous hybridization couldn’t identify all detectable cnvrs due to low homology between cattle probes and sheep dna for some regions and doesn’t show the cnvr distributions on the sheep genome. in addition to cgh, another major platform commonly used to identify cnvs is the snp array. in snp array, intensity values of snps derived from each sample are used to detect cnvs in each individual. comparison with two panels, cgh array has excellent performance in signal-to noise ratios, while the snp array based approach is more convenient for high-throughput analyses and follow-up association studies  <cit> . with the development of high density snp arrays, higher resolution of genomic regions can be achieved  <cit> . moreover, due to their low cost and high-density, commercial snp arrays have been widely used for cnv detection in domestic animals, and cnv mapping and functional studies have made important progress. however, there are no reports on cnv detection of sheep based on snp array data.

in this study, we will investigate genome-wide cnv in three sheep populations. to pursue convincing results, we firstly employ the penncnv program to analyze ovine snp <dig> genotyping data, and then use other algorithm program, cnvpartition, to validate cnvrs detected by penncnv. to our knowledge, we will construct the first sheep cnv map based on snp array data. this research will provide useful addition to the sheep cnv maps, and will provide potential genetic markers for further investigation on the roles of cnv in sheep productive traits and evolutionary adaptation.

RESULTS
snp genotyping
the genomic dna of  <dig> individual samples from three sheep breeds  were genotyped using illumina ovinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and the penncnv  software was used to identify the cnvs in the sheep genome . according to the results of penncnv, we defined the cnv call filtering criteria to exclude samples with low quality of signal intensity data. after applying the cnv quality control criteria detailed in the “methods” section,  <dig> samples  remained for further cnv analyses.

a: total samples before quality control by penncnv and cnvpartition.

b: the samples that passed the quality control of penncnv in  <dig> individuals from three sheep breeds.

c: the samples that passed the quality control of cnvpartition in  <dig> individuals from three sheep breeds.

genome-wide surveys of sheep cnvs
after filtering unreliable cnv calls, we discovered a total of  <dig> cnv events , with an average number of  <dig>  cnv events per individual. the average and median sizes of cnvs were  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively . we found that approximately 58% of the cnvs ranged from  <dig> to 500 kb, and 25% ranged from  <dig> to 100 kb in size distribution . smaller cnvs  were not identified in this study.

characteristics of cnvrs identified in sheep
cnv regions  were determined by merging the overlapping cnvs identified in all samples, as reported previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig> autosomal cnvrs were identified, covering  <dig>  mb of the sheep genomic sequence and corresponding to  <dig> % of the autosomal genome sequence  and  <dig> % of the whole sheep genome . more information on cnvrs is also presented in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> 

these  <dig> cnvrs, ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb with mean and median sizes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively , included  <dig> losses,  <dig> gains, and six with both events . loss events were present approximately  <dig> -fold more than gain events, similar to previously reports of other species  <cit> . the majority  of cnvrs ranged from 50 kb to 500 kb . furthermore, of the  <dig> cnvrs,  <dig> cnvrs were found in only one animal , whereas  <dig> cnvrs were found in ≥ two animals and breeds   <cit>  and  <dig> cnvrs had a frequency > 3%,  <dig> cnvrs had a frequency > 5%. . specifically, the cnvr ovis aries chromosome  9:11627386– <dig> had the highest frequency . in the report by mccarroll et al. <cit> , the copy number polymorphism  term was coined when describing  <dig> cnvrs as common cnvrs. in addition, as shown in table  <dig>  the numbers of cnvrs identified by penncnv were large difference among three sheep breeds. in the german mutton, we identified  <dig> cnvrs, which comprised  <dig> % of the total cnvrs detected. in sunite and dorper breeds,  <dig> and  <dig> cnvrs were detected, corresponding to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number, while  <dig> unique cnvrs,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cnvrs were detected in german mutton, sunite and dorper breeds, respectively.

a: cnvrs number means the total number detected in one breed.

b: unique cnvrs means cnvrs only detected in one breed.

construction of copy number variation map
we constructed the map of cnvr distribution on the chromosomes based on the sheep whole genome snp genotyping chips . the results indicated that the cnvs among sheep breeds were non-randomly distributed among the different chromosomes, and that the percentage of cnvrs in the chromosomes varies from  <dig> – <dig> % , with the top three highest percentages of cnvrs located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . this might be due to bias derived by the analysis of the ovine snp <dig> beadchip. chromosome  <dig> had the greatest number and largest length of cnvrs, whereas chromosome  <dig> had the smallest length and number of cnvrs. the most enriched chromosomes for cnvrs in sheep were chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

to verify the cnvs detected by penncnv, we also used the cnvpartition program implemented in illumina genomestudio to analyze the data and detect cnvs. after applying the quality filtering criteria, we identified  <dig> individuals with cnvs, and  <dig> cnvrs were determined by merging overlapping cnvs identified across all samples. it should be noted that all  <dig> individuals were encompassed by  <dig> individuals passed the quality filtering criteria of penncnv. the results of cnvrs distributed on chromosomes were similar to those of penncnv , and the oar <dig> showed the greatest enrichment for cnv , which was consistent with the result of penncnv program. but, chromosomes with more five cnvrs were oar <dig> and oar <dig>  the different results might be due to the different algorithms between penncnv and cnvpartition. in a comparison of the results from the penncnv and cnvpartition programs, we found  <dig> cnvrs identified by the penncnv program  that overlapped with the cnvpartition data, and the ‘losses’ and ‘gains’ of  <dig> cnvrs were consistent with the cnvpartition data. some cnvrs identified by the cnvpartition analysis were larger in size, resulting in overlapping of multiple cnvrs identified by penncnv, thus, we segmented these large cnvrs in the cnvpartition results. in total, we obtained  <dig> cnvrs by cnvpartition analysis .

cnv validation by quantitative pcr
we performed quantitative real-time pcr experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the copy number assignments. ten putative cnvrs were selected for cnv validation, these ten cnvrs represent different predicted status of copy numbers  and cnvr frequencies varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, of which four contained known sheep refseq genes in the ucsc database ; the remaining six cnvrs were selected randomly. we performed  <dig> qpcr assays in  <dig> animals, out of the  <dig> qpcr assays,  <dig> were in agreement with prediction by penncnv. when counting the cnvrs,  <dig> out of the  <dig> cnvrs confirmed the existence of copy number variations in at least one qpcr assay, whereas primer pairs in four other regions did not work .

functional enrichment analysis of cnvrs
we found five sheep refseq genes partially or entirely encompassing four cnvrs. to further analyze the gene content of the  <dig> cnvrs, we used a blastn search for homologous human and cattle sequences using the ucsc table browser tool. there were  <dig> refseq homologous human genes located within or partially overlapping with  <dig> cnvrs of the  <dig> cnvrs and similarly, there were  <dig> refseq homologous cattle genes located within or partially overlapping with  <dig> cnvrs of the  <dig> cnvrs . to assess the functional annotation of these cnvrs, we conducted gene ontology analysis  using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  functional annotation tool. we retrieved  <dig> gene symbols  to load into the david tool. we selected ‘human’ as the background, and the  <dig> corresponding human gene ids were identified in david. go analysis indicated that the genes overrepresented in david were involved in olfactory receptor activity, sensory perception of smell, sensory perception of chemical stimulus, sensory perception, cognition, neurological system processes, g-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway, cell surface receptor linked signal transduction, plasma membrane as well as integral and intrinsic membrane components, protein polymerization and microtubule-based movement. in addition to the above gene functions, the david pathway results showed genes involved in olfactory transduction and pathogenic escherichia coli . we also found that a number of cnvrs overlapped with known disease-related genes in the dgv database. a total of  <dig> disease-related genes reported in dgv were located either wholly or partially within cnvrs in our results .

comparison with other ruminant cnv studies
to compare cnvrs identified by snp platform in sheep genome which were overlapped with cnvrs reported in other ruminants, we migrated  <dig> cnvrs from isgc ovis aries  <dig>  to btau_ <dig>  using ucsc liftover tool  <cit>  and  <dig> cnvrs were obtained on btau_ <dig>  assembly. and then we compared these cnvrs with those previous cnv studies , including four experiments that two were carried out in sheep, goat and two in cattle using acgh platform  <cit>  and other two in cattle using the illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> . comparing sheep cnvrs detected by us and fontanesi et al.  <cit> , we found three cnvrs overlapped. in addition, there were found two sheep cnvrs matched goat cnvrs identified with acgh panel  <cit> . comparing sheep cnvrs with four other cattle cnvrs reported by liu et al.  <cit> . fadista et al.  <cit> . hou et al.  <cit>  and bea et al.  <cit> , we obtained  <dig> of  <dig> cnvrs mapped on btau_ <dig>  assembly overlapped with cattle cnvrs with acgh panel or snp panel.

discussion
in recent years, cnvs have been increasingly recognized as an important source of genetic variation and phenotypic diversity  <cit> . a number of cnvs associated with diseases have been found in human genetic researches, involving autoimmune disorders, schizophrenia, autism, as well as infectious and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . in addition, cnvs have been shown to play a role in pharmacokinetics in terms of drug efficacy and toxicity  <cit> . therefore, the systematic analysis and characterization of cnvs improves our understanding of genetic variation and is an important tool for deciphering the role of cnv in the heritability of complex traits. in the past few years, with the development of high-density genotyping arrays, detection of cnvs using snp genotyping arrays has become a cost-effective and efficient approach. fine-scale cnv maps for human and other species have been constructed and refined  <cit> .

in this study, we used whole genome genotyping based on ovine snp <dig> beadchip arrays to identify cnvs in the sheep genome. after genotyping  <dig> samples using the illumina platform from three sheep breeds, the signal intensity  and allelic intensity  ratio of all samples were exported using the illumina genomestudio software . in order to obtain a higher accuracy, quality control and cnv detection optimization was conducted using the penncnv software when generating cnv calls  <cit> . to identify reliable cnv data, other studies have used different criteria for filtering unreliable cnv calls. jakobsson et al. restricted analyses to cnvs with a minimum of  <dig> markers per cnv to minimize the number of false positives  <cit> . in our study using penncnv analysis, we tested the impact of genomic waves on cnv calls and the filtering parameters with or without the –gcmodel option set. compared with the results from the penncnv using the –gcmodel option, more cnvs were identified without the –gcmodel option  than with the –gcmodel option . this result was similar to that reported by hou et al. <cit> . these discordant calls were likely due to false positives called from the differentiating signal intensities caused by ‘genomic waves’. this further demonstrated that genomic waves have a significant effect on cnv analysis. we also used the ‘filter_cnv.pl’ program to perform sample-level quality control . after this step,  <dig> further samples were excluded because their intensity data failed to conform to the criteria. finally, the remaining  <dig> samples were used for cnv detection. this study focused only on the cnvs in  <dig> autosomes and excluded chrx and chrun from our analysis because the chrx sequence and annotations are still not well-known  <cit> , furthermore, their sequences and snps were uncertain, including the snp mapping.

we identified a total of  <dig> cnvrs in three sheep breeds using the penncnv detection algorithm. of these,  <dig> cnvrs were losses, higher than the proportion of gains . this result might be due to the fact that losses are easier to detect than gains, because the exponential intensity data is linearly correlated with the copy number  <cit> . to exclude the potential false positive signals, we used another cnv detection software, cnvpartition, which detected  <dig> cnvrs. forty-seven regions were consistently identified by both cnv detection software packages. compared to cnvpartition based on other algorithms, such as quantisnp  <cit> , birdsuite  <cit> , and gada  <cit> , penncnv combines multiple sources of information, including the total signal intensity and allelic intensity ratios at each snp marker to generate a hidden state for copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, the distance between neighboring snps, and the allele frequency of snps. penncnv also integrates a computational approach by fitting regression models with gc content to overcome ‘genomic waves’  <cit> .

we compared our cnv length dataset with another sheep cnv study that was based on a cross species cattle-sheep acgh experiment using a tiling oligonucleotide array with approximately  <dig>  probes designed using the bovine genome. because our dataset excluded cnv calls in the chrx and chrun, only autosomal cnvr calls  were compared to the autosomal cnv calls of that study . as in other cnv studies using acgh experiments  <cit> , the number of loss events in our dataset was larger than the number of gain events. however, further validation is required as it is also possible that purifying selection occurred  <cit> . the cnv sizes in our study ranged from  <dig> to 500 kb , which differed from those in the work of fontanesi et al.   <cit> . this cnv size difference was likely due to sampling differences or to resolution and genome coverage differences between the two techniques. the snp genotyping resolution was  <dig>  kb , whereas that of the acgh platform was  <dig>  kb. a snp array lacked non-polymorphic probes designed specifically for cnv identification. thus, only the large cnvrs were identified with the ovine snp <dig> assay. in future experiments, high-density snp arrays combined with improved cnv calling algorithms could remedy these differences. in addition, we investigated the distribution pattern of these cnvrs in  <dig> autosomes and determined whether the cnv region was common in three sheep breeds. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvrs had frequency rates of > 3%, whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvrs had a frequency rate of < 1% in  <dig> individuals. this result might have been influenced by the innate limitation of ovine snp  <dig> arrays, and therefore, many common cnvs could have been missed.

we used ucsc gene annotation  to identify genes that were located within or partially overlapped with cnvrs. initially, we used a database of known sheep genes to annotate the gene content of cnvrs. however, the annotation results showed only four cnvrs overlapping with five known refseq genes in sheep cnvrs . these results are likely attributable to the fact that the sheep genome is not well-annotated compared to the human genome or that of other domesticated animals  <cit> . the current sheep genome version  is incomplete and known related genes are rarely identified in the sheep refseq gene database  <cit> . therefore, we performed a blastn search for homologous human and cattle sequences using the ucsc table browser tool, and identified  <dig> genes homologous to human ids identified in david. we conducted a go analysis to determine the biological effects of the  <dig> copy number variant genes . similar to other results for go analyses, the enriched genes were related to those involved in olfactory receptor  activity, sensory perception of smell, sensory perception of chemical stimulus, sensory perception, cognition, g-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway, neurological system processes, cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction, plasma membrane and integral membrane components. table  <dig> showed that the genes involved in environmental responses were over-represented in the cnvrs. in this study, functional analysis results were similar to those previously reported in cnv studies in human and other mammals  <cit> . this significant  enrichment for or activity might represent the frequent occurrence of cnvs in gene clusters for or  <cit> , as previously observed in cattle  <cit> . in addition, we observed  <dig> human orthologous genes in sheep cnvrs, of which  <dig> genes were previously reported in the dgv database . moreover, we identified cnv regions that may overlap with online mendelian inheritance in man  genes influencing disease susceptibility . notwithstanding, in the great majority of cases, these cnvs encompass genes and thereby directly affect gene dosage by loss or gain in the level of gene expression  <cit> . however, some other reports have suggested that cnvs are located preferably in gene-poor regions  <cit>  or in noncoding regions, and some studies provide evidence that the cnvs are considered nonpathogenic. recent studies have described genome-wide distribution of cnvs in regions that encompass noncoding sequences, thereby affecting the regulation of distant target genes  <cit> . this suggested impact of cnvs in noncoding regions requires further elucidation in future studies. as discussed above, functional analysis studies indicated that the cnv genes possess a wide spectrum of molecular functions. however, since the sheep genome is less well-defined, sheep cnvrs warrant further investigation for their roles in complex traits.

to verify cnv obtained by penncnv, we conducted quantitative pcr  on ten selected cnvrs and compared them with a sample control region known to have no cnvs . we found that  <dig> % of our qpcr assays  agree with our cnvrs predictions in these regions. in total, six regions of these cnvrs were validated in at least one qpcr assay. however, it should be noted that another four cnvrs were not confirmed by qpcr . reasons for this discrepancy between the cnvr analysis of ovine snp <dig> beadchip data and the qpcr experiment may be due to the fact that the low probe density of the ovine snp <dig> beadchip made it difficult to identify the true boundaries of cnvrs, resulting in an overestimation of their actual sizes. in addition, the primer pairs might have been designed outside the copy number polymorphic region.

in this research, only a small proportion of cnvrs identified overlapped with other studies. a similar situation was also encountered in human and other mammal cnv studies  <cit> . this indicated that a vast amount of cnvs existing had not been detected in the ovine genome. furthermore, a comparative analysis of cnvrs identified in sheep, goat and cattle could reveal the evolutionary mechanisms determining cnv formation during the mammalian evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
we firstly constructed a sheep cnv map based on the ovine snp <dig> array.  <dig> cnvrs were totally identified in the sheep autosomal genome, these cnvrs were non-randomly distributed on chromosomes, and 70% of which  were shared in > two animals. we also confirmed  <dig> cnvrs in total of  <dig> selected cnvrs by qpcr method. compared with the results of cnv studies based on acgh, the currently available genome wide snp assays can infer ovine cnv efficiently. however, it should be noticed that smaller size cnvs  were not identified using this snp panel and only  <dig> out of the  <dig> qpcr assays confirmed in this study was likely to be a overestimation of the true number and true boundary of cnvrs in the sheep genome. on the other hand, in this study, we using two detection programs: penncnv and cnvpartition, to identify the sheep genome cnvs, results indicated that  <dig> cnvrs identified by the penncnv  overlapped with the cnvpartition data , which highlighted the differences and commonalities of the two detection methods. follow-up studies for high-resolution cnv mapping require improved snp assay and next-generation sequencing to improve the accuracy of cnv calling. in addition, integration of different algorithms can enhance the detection of genomic structure variations. furthermore, our findings would be of help for understanding the ovine genome and provide preliminary foundation for carrying out the cnvs association studies with economically important phenotypes of sheep in the future.
