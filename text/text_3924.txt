BACKGROUND
a major challenge in current equine genomics is to understand the genetic basis of mutations influencing stallion fertility. in hanoverian stallions, several studies implicated loci that have been shown to play a significant role in stallion fertility. mutations within crisp <dig>  <cit> , spata <dig>  inhba, ace, sp <dig>  fshb, prlr , plcz <dig>  <cit>  and fkbp <dig>  <cit>  were significantly associated with stallion fertility. abnormalities in number of x- and/or y chromosomes have been shown as causes for abnormal sexual development . until now, only few mutations were identified to be associated with sub- or infertility in stallions. fkbp <dig> genotyping was recommended for stallions affected by impaired acrosome reaction . in human, only 20 % of male factor infertility can be diagnosed using genetic testing  <cit> . whole-genome sequencing approaches facilitate a comprehensive identification of high-impact variants with potentially deleterious effects on traits analysed  <cit> . rare genetic variants are more likely to be functionally deleterious and to cause loss-of function of coding proteins  <cit> . recently, whole-genome sequencing was used to uncover the roles of rare genetic variants associated with spermatogenic failure in men  <cit> . to date, no whole-genome sequence screens were performed for stallion fertility. we employed next-generation sequence  data to screen male fertility associated genes in order to unravel the role of genetic variants for which damaging effects on the protein structure were predicted. herein, we employed bioinformatic analysis to identify human and mice genes linked through common gene ontology  male reproductive processes. in order to focus the search for rare high-impact variants within the gene list, we filtered the whole genomes sequence data for variants which were only present as wild type homozygotes or heterozygotes in fertile horses. we assumed that in fertile stallions, variants with deleterious effects on fertility should be restricted to heterozygous genotypes for the recessive alleles or the homozygous wild type genotype for the dominant allele, and the presence of one of these variants may reduce stallion fertility. the objective of the present study was to genotype rare high-impact variants retrieved from ngs-data of  <dig> horses in order to unravel harmful genetic variants in a large sample of stallions.

RESULTS
search for genes involved in stallion reproduction
gene ontology  terms for male reproductive processes and ensembl and ncbi databases were used to search for genes with an effect on male fertility in human and mice. we retrieved a list of  <dig> genes identities . using g:profiler  <cit>  we could convert  <dig> genes to known equine orthologs and had to exclude  <dig> genes due to unknown equine annotation or unknown chromosomal position. using panther classification system  <cit> , the  <dig> male fertility related genes were assigned to  <dig> pathways,  <dig> molecular functions,  <dig> biological processes and  <dig> cellular components.

mutation detection in  <dig> equine genes
we searched the whole genome sequences of all  <dig> horses for genetic variants within the  <dig> male reproduction related genes. the first filter sorted out all genetic variants for which both homozygous genotypes and the heterozygous genotypes were present. this filter left  <dig> genetic variants with influence on the coding sequence and contained only variants for which the mutant homozygous genotype was not present. the second filtering for high impact variants retrieved a total of  <dig> snps within  <dig> genes and  <dig> indels within  <dig> genes . further evaluation was restricted to snp variants only. of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps were located in 15/ <dig> genes for stallion reproduction and three snps  were not obviously related to male reproduction, but located within uncharacterized genes or pseudogenes on the complementary dna strand . the most frequently predicted high-impact effects were donor splice site disruptions  and stop codon gains  . we could assign these  <dig> genes with possibly rare high-impact variants to four pathways,  <dig> molecular functions,  <dig> biological processes and one cellular component. using genemania, we constructed a gene-gene functional network for 13/ <dig> genes based on go annotation .table  <dig> comparison of snps with high effect on protein structure in genes for stallion fertility among breeds using whole-genome sequences of fertile stallions

validation of high-impact snps in fertile stallions
in total, we genotyped  <dig> snps whereof two snps, one in fndc3a and one snp on the complementary dna strand , proved monomorphic in a sample of  <dig> stallions. out of the  <dig> remaining snps genotyped,  <dig> snps were related to male reproduction. two snps  were located within uncharacterized genes/pseudogenes on the complementary dna strand whereas these snps had no high impact within the candidate genes on protein structure. genotyping for the  <dig> polymorphic snps was performed in  <dig> stallions from  <dig> different breeds using pcr-rflp and competitive allele specific pcr  genotyping technique . three snps within neurl <dig>  ghrl and btnl <dig> deviated from hardy weinberg equilibrium  . for all snps, the minor allele was represented by the mutant allele with a mean minor allele frequency  of  <dig>  . for 6/ <dig> variants all three genotypes were found, of which the mutant homozygous genotypes were underrepresented with a mean genotype frequency of  <dig>  . for 9/ <dig> genetic variants, no stallion exhibited the mutant homozygous genotype . the expected number of mutant homozygous genotypes for stallions, calculated as q <dig>  x number of stallions  stallions, revealed two variants within foxp <dig> and ovgp <dig> with expected number of genotypes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the variants within ensecag <dig> and ensecag <dig> were homozygous wild type in all stallions .table  <dig> validation of  <dig> high-impact snps in  <dig> fertile stallions

significant associations of the high-impact variants with the estimated breeding values of the paternal component for the pregnancy rate per estrus  in hanoverian stallions  are indicated by bonferroni-corrected p-values. for each variant, a plus sign indicates the missing mutant homozygous genotype , high and low heterozygous genotype frequencies  and the expected number of mutant homozygous genotypes for stallions e  are given. the number of breeds where the variants were observed is counted and a grouping  by the minor allele frequency  is given



we grouped the genetic variants genotyped into four groups  according to their minor allele frequency . in group i, the mutant allele did not occur , in group ii, the mutant allele occurred in a very low frequency, which were classified as rare variants   <cit> . in group iii, the mutant allele occurred in a low frequency , and in group iv the mutant allele had a moderate frequency . variants in non-male reproduction related genes ensecag <dig> and ensecag <dig> were sorted into group i. variants in cftr, pkd <dig> and spata31e <dig> were classified as rare variants . eight variants were sorted into group iii and four variants into group iv . the distribution of the variants genotyped within discovery breeds and validation cohorts should allow distinguish between private snps and snps shared by several breeds. with the exception of two private icelandic snps within ensecag <dig> and ensecag <dig>  all high-impact snps were shared by 2– <dig> breeds .

association analysis in hanoverian stallions
in  <dig> hanoverian stallions, a nominally significant association with de-regressed ebv-pat was found for the notch <dig> variant g.37455302g>a  using a model fitting the genotypes. accounting for multiple testing of  <dig> snps using bonferroni correction, resulted in a significant association for the notch <dig> variant g.37455302g>a  explaining 11 % of the variation of de-regressed ebv-pat. a mixed model analysis accounting for genomic relationships among stallions gave a p-value of  <dig>  and after bonferroni correction a p-value of  <dig> . hanoverian stallions exhibiting the wild-type for the notch1-associated snp had a de-regressed ebv-pat of  <dig> onto the scale 100 ±  <dig> indicating stallion fertility closely at the population average. the differences among the notch1-homozygotes were  <dig> points of the de-regressed ebv-pat . stallions heterozygous for the mutant notch1-variant had a mean of  <dig> for the de-regressed ebv-pat. other variants failed the nominal significance thresholds . stallions heterozygous or homozygous for the kdr-variant showed a higher mean of de-regressed ebv-pat than homozygous wild type stallion. due to high standard errors and low genotype frequencies, no significant associations, but a tendency among the homozygous and heterozygous genotype means for de-regressed ebv-pat were found for six snps within neurl <dig>  ovgp <dig>  foxp <dig>  notch <dig> , spata31e <dig> and fbxo <dig> .

classification of high-impact variants
based on validation and association results, we distinguished three classes among the high-impact variants . the first class  regards loci with a significant association with ebv-pat and a low to moderate allele frequency. only the notch <dig> variant g.37455302g>a fulfills these requirements for class i loci. the second class  should contain loci which may be considered as putative indicators for fertility. herein, we classified  <dig> variants as class ii loci. the third class  comprises high-impact variants with no obvious significant relation to stallion reproduction. as class iii loci we sorted in two private snps, only present in icelandic stallions and variants with all three genotypes but not significantly associated with de-regressed ebv-pat.table  <dig> most promising high-impact variants in genes contributing to stallion fertility

three classes of high-impact variants with corresponding single nucleotide polymorphism  identities  and gene are given



discussion
screening of whole genome sequences for high-impact genetic variants within gene networks for male fertility in stallions appeared useful to identify variants that may highly influence stallion fertility. all high-impact variants we classified due to stop codon gains, start losses, donor or acceptor splice site disruptions can be classified as loss- of-function  mutations  <cit> . a major effect on fertility by loss-of-function mutations was demonstrated in previous studies . data from this study indicate a high-impact variant as a stallion fertility-associated locus  in notch <dig> and  <dig> high-impact variants as putative stallion fertility-associated loci . genes putatively associated with stallion fertility included cftr, ovgp <dig>  fbxo <dig>  tssk <dig>  pkd <dig>  foxp <dig>  tcp <dig>  spata31e <dig> and notch <dig> . these genes are connected with each other via functional interacting networks based on go male fertility processes.

in mice, notch <dig> gain-of-function resulted in reduced male fertility due to failure of spermatogenesis  <cit> , while immotile spermatozoa and sterility was detected in neurl <dig> null mice  <cit> . the fertile stallions used for validation were frequently uses in artificial insemination, thus sperm motility and morphology are in the normal range in these stallions. fertile stallions that exhibited unfavorable genotypes in notch1-high-impact variants had de-regressed ebv-pat as well ebv-pat below the population mean suggesting reduced fertility due to other unknown damaging mechanism on sperm function. for the kdr high-impact variant g.77472655g>c in kdr, heterozygous or homozygous carriers showed putatively higher de-regressed ebv-pat and ebv-pat implicating a beneficial effect of this variant. the latter is supported by the ‘less-is-more’ hypothesis  <cit>  and an advantageous effect of deleterious variants due to positive selection  <cit> . an advantageous effect on reproduction of deleterious variants alleles due to positive selection was recently demonstrated in buffalo  <cit> . notch <dig>  neurl <dig> and kdr are key factors for male fertility, making their application for stallion fertility highly desirable. notch <dig> is part of the notch signaling network and regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells  <cit> . neurl <dig> is required for axonemal integrity in spermatozoa  <cit> . it functionally belongs to spermatogenesis  and is associated to spermatid differentiation , sperm motility  and spermatid differentiation . kdr is present in spermatozoa  <cit>  and was identified as a regulator of germ cell survival during establishment of spermatogenesis in cattle  <cit> .

based on our hypothesis of missing mutant genotypes in fertile stallions, we detected  <dig> putative loci for stallion fertility defined as class ii variants. these non-private and high-impact variants were only present in very low to or low frequency. the expected frequency of mutant homozygous genotypes for stallions e indicated a low-probability of their occurrence in fertile stallions. as an explanation for the missing homozygous mutant genotypes in fertile stallions one can assume that homozygous mutant genotypes are limited to infertile stallions. this may be further tested in an unselected sample of male foals under the assumption that these mutations are still segregating in very few males with the homozygous mutant genotype may be infertile.

class ii variants within cftr and tssk <dig> indicated high-impact on male fertility, confirmed by several studies in human and mice. in infertile men, high-effect variants at acceptor splice site in cftr were found in non-obstructive azoospermia, oligospermia, asthenospermia and teratospermia men  <cit> . infertility due to spermatogenic impairment was reported in male tssk <dig> knockout mice  <cit>  and in chinese men exhibiting a triallelic snp in tssk <dig>  <cit> . pkd <dig> is required for male reproductive tract development. pkd1-null mice develop multiple organ defects in the male reproductive tract and infertility  <cit> . tcp- <dig> modulates sperm fertilizing ability. it stimulates capacitation and inhibits spontaneous acrosome loss  <cit> . subfertility in human could result from alterations in the structure of tcp- <dig>  <cit> .

validation of class ii high-impact variants within spata31e <dig>  ovgp <dig>  foxp <dig>  fbxo <dig> indicate further putative loci for stallion fertility, however the consequences of mutations on male infertility in human and mice are not yet known. nevertheless, spata31e <dig> functionally belongs to spermatogenesis . ovgp <dig> is linked to single fertilization  via binding to oocyte zona pellucida  <cit> . it enhances sperm viability, motility  <cit>  and capacitation and shows beneficial effects on fertilization and early embryo development  <cit> . foxp <dig> is an androgen-responsive transcription factor that modulates androgen receptor signaling  <cit> . fbxo <dig> place a role in sperm-induced meiotic exit  <cit>  and adjustment of the number of round spermatids  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
out of  <dig> equine genes involved in male fertility processes we identified the g.37455302g>a notch <dig> variant as a high-impact snp with a significant effect on hanoverian stallion fertility. as this detected high-impact-variant only occurs in a rare frequency in fertile stallions of many different breeds we recommend selection against this unfavourable genotype to improve stallion fertility. next, we identified  <dig> high-impact snps in cftr, ovgp <dig>  fbxo <dig>  tssk <dig>  pkd <dig>  foxp <dig>  tcp <dig>  spata31e <dig> and notch <dig>  absent in fertile stallions with putative deleterious effects in fertility of stallions. as a consequence, an early identification of carriers in unselected young stallions should be a beneficial to select only high-quality stallions for future breeding.
