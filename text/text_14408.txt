BACKGROUND
in humans, goal-directed movements to an object in space are improved by foveal vision, namely by gaze anchoring on the object  <cit> . since motor and visual information are encoded in different reference frames, accurate reaching and grasping movements in space require ongoing registration and coordinate transformation of visual percepts with gaze and limb positioning. one essential transformation is to convert the retinal image from eye-centered coordinates in a target location with respect to the head by taking into account the position of the eyes in the orbit  <cit> . single-cell recordings in monkeys revealed that the neural substrate of the visual-to-motor coordinate transformations is a change in the visual or motor response properties according to gaze position in extrastriate visual, parietal, oculomotor, premotor and motor areas . functional magnetic resonance imaging  studies have localized human homologues of such monkey areas and have showed that eye position signals modulate activity of extrastriate visual areas  <cit>  and the parieto-frontal network related to hand-arm movements  <cit> . less is known at the earliest stage of visual processing, namely in the primary visual area . previous electrophysiological  <cit>  and modeling  <cit>  studies described eye position dependent activity in v <dig> neurons to a lesser extent than that reported in parietal and premotor cortex but consistent with the idea that both retinal and eye position signals may also converge at early vision stage. however, the direct influence of eye position on v1-related activity in humans has not been investigated. consequently, we used a specific experimental design based on pattern-onset visual evoked potentials  recordings to study the effect of eye position exclusively on v <dig> activity in humans. thus, we focused our investigation on the first major vep component c <dig>  obtained using pattern-onset stimulation, because its distribution over the scalp and its retinotopic properties indicate an origin from the calcarine fissure that is v <dig>  this issue has been the conclusion of all previous studies over the past  <dig> years regarding the cortical visual areas that generate the early components of pattern-onset vep . the most recent reports even demonstrated in individual subjects a close anatomical correspondence between modelled dipoles for the c <dig> component and sites of activation in the calcarine fissure obtained in fmri in response to the same visual stimuli  <cit> . the purpose of the present report was therefore to investigate the eye position-dependent activity of v <dig> in humans by characterizing the early c <dig> component of vep and testing its properties at different eye positions.

RESULTS
the c <dig> component reverses classically in polarity for upper vs. lower visual field stimulation . consequently, we first characterized the c <dig> component over the  <dig> subjects by observing its polarity inversion for a central eye position. figure 1b illustrates the representative polarity inversion of the c <dig> component on the grand averaged of vep over the  <dig> subjects and in response to stimuli in the upper and lower quadrants of the right visual fields. equivalent vep and c <dig> polarity inversion were obtained in response to stimuli in the upper and lower quadrants of the left visual fields. the polarity inversion of the c <dig> components on the grand average veps in response to upper and lower hemifield stimuli were described previously for occipito-parietal sites using a 10– <dig> system montage with  <dig> scalp sites . it is noteworthy that a similar polarity inversion was measured in our study using only two occipital intermediate sites  of the modified 10–20-system montage .

once the c <dig> component was characterized for both upper and lower quadrant visual fields, the effect of eye position on c <dig> amplitude was measured only for both left and right lower quadrants visual field that is for the most salient c <dig> component which we observed.

mean peak latencies of c <dig> was calculated in each subject in response to both left and right lower visual quadrants and for both in <dig> and in <dig> recording sites. they ranged between  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ms that are consistent with the c <dig> latency range previously observed in numerous studies  <cit> . for each subject, the c <dig> amplitude for five different eye positions  was then measured at these mean latencies for each lower quadrant and each recording site and, with respect to a  <dig> ms pre-stimulus baseline.

we observed that checkerboard presented in the lower visual field elicited veps with modulated amplitudes of the c <dig> component in respect of eye position. grand averaged veps over the  <dig> subjects in response to flashed stimuli in the right lower quadrant of the visual field for three different eye positions  are shown in figure 2a. it is noteworthy that the eye position-dependent modulation of c <dig> amplitude was observed at the in <dig> recording site for a 20° rightward eye position  and at the in <dig> recording site with a 20° leftward eye position .

in other words, the eye position effect was observed at the occipital recording site contralateral to the direction of the eye deviation. equivalent veps but reverse eye-position effects were obtained in response to left field stimuli. a one-way friedman repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted for each recording site and for each visual stimulation revealing a significant main effect of eye position on the amplitude of the c <dig> component. complete data obtained at both recording sites, for each lower visual field are shown in figure 2b. we chose to represent these data using relative amplitude measures that are amplitude for deviated eye position subtracted by the amplitude for central eye position. it means that amplitude zero corresponds to the central eye position situation. a post-hoc dunnett's test  using 0° as reference showed that the amplitude of the c <dig> component measured contralaterally to the deviated eye position was significantly different from 0° except for one situation . conversely, the amplitude of the c <dig> component recorded ipsilaterally to the deviated eye position was not significantly different from 0° excepted for one situation . note that no parametric effect was observed for the c <dig> amplitude between 10° and 20° of eye eccentricity .

the overall result of the present study revealed that the amplitude of first major component of vep elicited by checkerboard  is modulated by the eye position. the previous data linking the c <dig> component to a striate cortex generator, namely v <dig> activity , led us to suggest that eye position influences the earliest cortical stage of visual processing.

one may first suggest that the present results may be explained by the difficulty of maintaining eccentric fixation, which may have altered the pattern of fixational eye movements, such as microsaccades . recent studies have shown that microsaccades modulated neural activity in v <dig>  <cit> , but to our knowledge no study has examined the effect of maintaining eccentric fixation on the occurrence of microsaccades. in the present study, we were able to track spontaneous saccadic eye movements superior to 1°. a one-way friedman repeated measures analysis of variance for each visual stimulation revealed no significant main effect of eye position on the amplitude  and on the frequency  of saccades superior to 1°. we cannot rule out quantitatively a possible role for microsaccades in the eye position-dependent v <dig> activity. regardless of such putative effects, however, one may argue that in case of an increase of the number of microsaccades related to eccentric fixation, a similar effect in terms of magnitude would be observed for both left- and rightward deviation. this was not the case in the present study.

the question also arises if the effects of changing c <dig> amplitude may be due to oculomotor signals and/or retinal disparity that is to the difference in the position of the visual stimulus on each retina related to relative monitor distance. the absence of any parametric effect for the c <dig> amplitude between 10° and 20° of eye eccentricity may indicate that eye position effects are not due to the difference in the horizontal retinal disparity, but one may argue that a putative relationship between the horizontal disparity and the c <dig> amplitude is not linear. we evaluated the difference of both horizontal and vertical disparity between the different eye's deviations in our study . figure 3b shows that the difference between the magnitude of disparity for the central eye position and each deviated eye condition depends on both eye deviation and the distance of the visual stimulus from the fixation point. interestingly, such a difference in terms of horizontal and vertical disparity does not depend on the stimulated quadrant visual field in the range of the present checkerboard's width. in other words, the magnitude of the relative disparity for a given distance from the fixation point and for a given deviated eye condition is similar for both left and right visual field stimulation. since we observed that the c <dig> amplitude varied inversely in function of the hemifield stimulation , the eye-position effect observed on the c <dig> amplitude cannot be simply related to a horizontal and/or vertical disparity effect.

both direct and indirect arguments also suggest that variations in the c <dig> amplitude are not due to attention. firstly, the subjects were instructed to keep firmly visual attention on the fixation point suggesting that the potential degree of attention required fixating binocularly the red fixation dot was similar across the different deviated eye positions. secondly, numerous recent studies gave impetus to an emerging view that v <dig> activity may be modulated by attention through delayed feedback signals  from extrastriate and/or oculomotor structures while the initial c <dig> sensory response  was not modulated by attention  <cit> . our present findings, together with those aforementioned, allow considering that both eye position and attention-related signals may affect the early stage of visual processing in different manner. the former may comes from extraocular muscle afferents and/or corollary discharges while the later is considered as a late top-down process  <cit> .

finally, trotter et al.  have shown that an eye position signal  is involved in the neural modulation process dealing with the eye position-dependent visual response observed in area v <dig> of behaving monkeys. oculomotor signals coming from extraocular muscle afferents and/or corollary discharges are considered as the substrate of such an eye position signal and have been previously described in v <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present results and previous works obtained from neural recordings in monkeys indicate that changes in eye position can modify response properties in v <dig> that is at the earliest cortical stage of visual processing. among the visuo-motor processing allowing accurate reaching and grasping movements in space on the basis of the image seen by the retina, the primary visual area may be therefore one of the first cortical relay to convert the image in eye-centered coordinates into a target location by taking into account the position of the eyes in the orbit. it endorses some recent arguments pointing out that v <dig> could no longer be considered only in relation to the pattern of light falling on the retina but appears to be a cortical area in which contextual influences take place too  <cit> .
