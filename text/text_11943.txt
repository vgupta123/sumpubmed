BACKGROUND
the protein kinase family is one of the largest gene families in the human genome and protein phosphorylation affects more than 30% of all proteins. most kinases are involved in signal transduction pathways that govern cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. protein kinase expression and activities are highly misregulated in cancer, justifying the development of therapeutic strategies that target kinases. inhibitors of protein kinase oncogenes such as gefinitib for egfr
 <cit> , imatinib for bcr-abl
 <cit>  or trastuzumab for her2
 <cit>  have been subjected to clinical assays, but the efficiency of targeting specific kinase oncogenes has been impaired by the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancers. in order to improve antitumor treatment, investigation of the non-oncogene dependency of cancer, combined therapies and multiple-target approaches have been proposed
. these have proven to be highly complex tasks, and an integrated vision of kinome networks is required to optimize for the best combinations of targets. over the past decade, high-throughput approaches have significantly contributed to the global picture of kinase profiles in cancer and cell proliferation, mainly by describing the differential expression and activation of numerous kinases. however, the basis for the dynamic complexity of kinase networks remains unclear. unlike global analyses such as gene-expression array and proteomics, rna interference  technology is a functional approach that has been used both to identify new selective targets and to understand the cell’s response to cancer drugs
 <cit> . using single-well screening, the small interference rna  method was shown to be more suitable for phenotypic analysis and has been successfully employed to investigate genes involved in the cell cycle and in cell proliferation
. taken together, genome-wide rnai screens have led to the identification of more than  <dig>  <dig> genes that are implicated in cell proliferation but basing the rational choice of efficient targets on these data has proven difficult. more recently, integrative screening combining genome-wide rnai screens with multiple biologic data have been developed to filter for high-confidence candidate targets
 <cit> . however combining results from different resources to extract information of interest remains a challenging task. the originality of the work reported here consists in the specific screen of a set of  <dig> kinases and, using integrative data-mining analyses to filter functional kinase groups, constructing kinase interaction networks that successfully identify new biologically relevant targets.

for this purpose, we developed an image-based rnai screen to identify kinases required for cell-cycle progression. the readout of the screen consists in the quantification of mitotic index  after rnai treatment. based on ontology annotations, two groups of kinases leading to either low or high mitotic index  were functionally characterized. by extracting information from phosphopoint, the human interactome and phosphoprotein database, we further generated protein networks that permit the identification of two key kinases as regulators of tumor cell growth that control cell growth, the fer and crkl tyrosine kinases that form a pivotal subnetwork which controls the egfr mitogenic pathway.

RESULTS
protein kinases control the cell cycle and their deregulation has been widely reported in cancers. as a consequence, targeted inhibition of kinases in cancer therapy has been extensively studied but identifying combinations of protein kinase targets is required to improve therapeutic strategies. rnai strategies based on genome-wide screens have been previously used to identify genes involved in the cell cycle and mitosis, but with a low redundancy of identified kinase genes
. less than five kinases have been recovered in at least two studies, with plk <dig> as the only common hit. in the present study, we have focused on genes coding for kinases by screening a sirna library targeting  <dig> kinases . we then developed a robust rnai assay to identify modifications in hela cell proliferation and mitosis. cells were transfected with  <dig> individual sirna duplexes targeting each kinase and cultured for 48 hours. next, cells were fluorescently labeled for dna  and phosphorylated histone h <dig> , a marker for mitotic cells . the mitotic index was calculated as the ratio between the number of dapi-stained cells and ph3-positive cells . on a log <dig> scale, values above or below the median ±  <dig> median absolute deviations  were selected as primary hits. as illustrated in figure 
 <dig> and listed in table 
 <dig>   <dig> primary hits led to significant variations of the mitotic index  when compared to the mean mi of cycling cells . from this analysis, we could identify two groups of kinases whose inhibition leads to low  and high mi . comparisons with data from the literature show that  <dig> kinases had been already identified, as well as  <dig> additional related kinases . note that results from this analysis included data from  <dig> published studies based on whole-genome rnai screens, suggesting that use of dedicated sirna libraries greatly improves the identification of kinases that interfere with cell proliferation.figure  <dig>

lists of protein kinases whose inhibition leads to low and high mitotic index


ontology annotations discriminate between functionally different kinase groups
to better understand the significance of the existence of two distinct kinase groups whose knockdown leads to opposite effects, we investigated their functional annotations using gene ontology analysis. based on a classical hypergeometric test for gene ontology term enrichment, the fatigo tool provides a t-test for cross-comparison enrichment analyses from two gene lists. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the two kinase lists  were characterized by different biological processes. kinases from the rnai assay that induced a high mi are associated with the ontology terms "cell cycle" and "cell proliferation", while kinases from the rnai assay that induced a low mi are associated with the ontology terms "response to external and chemical stimulus". in accordance with these observations, we found that the two groups of kinases were also differentially enriched in cellular component terms compared with the whole-genome annotations . kinases for which sirna treatment induced a high mi were enriched in nucleus-related terms that include "microtubule organizing center" and "spindle pole" , while kinases for which sirna treatment induced a low mi were enriched in cytosol-related terms, with  <dig> kinases annotated with the "cytoplasm" term . taken together, this ontology-based characterization strongly suggests that kinases from each mi group are associated with specific biologic functions.figure  <dig>

based on this ontology analysis, we postulated that an increased mitotic index is associated with cell-cycle arrest during mitosis, which involves kinases related to nuclear processes, while a diminished mitotic index is associated with cell-cycle blockage in early phases , which involves kinases related to cytosolic signaling. kinases implicated in the successful completion of mitosis were present in the high mitotic-index list. these include bub <dig>  which is involved in the spindle checkpoint function, plk- <dig> and - <dig>  critical regulators of cell mitosis and cytokinesis, and nek <dig>  from the nima gene family, which controls initiation of mitosis. we note that nima gene-family neks have been previously implicated in the regulation of various aspects of the cell cycle and that nek- <dig> is physically associated with raf- <dig> and mek <dig>  formation of the three-protein complex being necessary for nek-10-mediated mek <dig> autoactivation
 <cit> .

in contrast, numerous kinases from the low mitotic-index list are involved in signaling pathways. for example, prkce is a serine- and threonine-specific protein kinase activated by diacylglycerol, pik3cb, is a phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and dgke is a diacylglycerol kinase involved mainly in the regeneration of phosphatidylinositol  from diacylglycerol in the pi cycle during signal transduction. similarly, the mapkapk <dig> and mapapk <dig> kinases, which are activated by map kinases such as mapk1/erk, mapk14/p38-alpha and mapk11/p38-beta, mediate the signaling response to cellular stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. in accordance with our data, moffat et al.
 <cit>  reported gene targets involved in signaling pathways for which shrnas induced a decrease in mi, such as diacylglycerol kinase , interleukin- <dig> receptor-associated kinase  <dig>  and glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> beta . however, it is important to note that our approach enriches the list of putative kinases involved in these processes, suggesting that dedicated sirna libraries are more efficient than global-genome approaches to identify signaling kinase targets.

integrative phosphoproteomic approaches identify essential modules
to further understand the contribution of these signaling kinases in the control of cell proliferation, we next built the functional interactome of the two kinase groups. to do this, we first integrated protein and phosphoproteomic interactions into our data by extracting protein interactions that include phosphoprotein substrates from phosphopoint, a comprehensive human kinase interactome and phospho-protein database.  <dig> and  <dig> protein-protein interactions  were identified for kinases from the low-mi and high-mi groups, respectively . we next generated networks where nodes stand for proteins and edges represent biological information including "interacting proteins", "interacting proteins as well as phospho-proteins", "substrates" and "substrates as well as interacting phospho-proteins". as shown in figure 
 <dig> for the kinases from the high-mi group  and figure 
 <dig> for the kinases from low-mi group , both networks exhibit scale-free behavior, meaning that they follow a power law-degree distribution which confers scale-invariance properties and network’s robustness. expandable views of graphs were provided as additional file
1: figures s <dig> and s <dig> and topology analyses were further detailed in additional file
1: table s <dig>  of note, 31/ <dig> and 31/ <dig> kinases from low- and high-mi groups were respectively included in ppi graphs, the remaining hit kinases not being documented in the phosphopoint database. however, ontology-based comparison of the two ppi networks confirmed the differential functions of the two groups. as show in figure 
 <dig>  heat-map visualization of molecular functions showed a significant enrichment in "cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity" for ppi from the high-mi group, while ppi from the low-mi group were significantly enriched in receptor signaling-related functions such as "growth factor receptor binding", "protein serine_threonine tyrosine kinase" and "receptor signaling protein activity". these integrative ppi analyses are in agreement with the notion of specific molecular functions associated with kinases from the low-mi  and high-mi groups .figure  <dig>

visualization of ppi helps to identify local units of the networks, defined as modules which function as essential components of the network. accordingly, ppi from the high-mi group showed a specific "mitosis regulatory module" that includes the polo-kinase  <dig> plk <dig>  the mitotic checkpoint kinase bub <dig>  the membrane-associated kinase pkmyt <dig> and the cell cycle division kinase cdc <dig> . note that plk <dig> phosphorylates and activates bub <dig> to localize it to the kinetochore, phosphorylates and inhibits the negative regulator pkmyti and interacts with the g1/s kinase cdc7p to target it to initiation complexes late in g <dig> 

focusing on signaling kinases from the low-mi group, we identified an unexpected module that includes crkl and fer kinases and three members of the epidermal growth factor  receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases, egfr, erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> . these interactions support a possible role of these two protein kinases as key regulators of g1/s phase progression, which is known to be driven by egfr signaling. to validate this hypothesis, we next investigated the role of these two kinases using direct experimental approaches.figure  <dig>

identification of fer and crkl as pivotal protein kinases involved in mitogenic signaling pathways
while crkl  and fer non-receptor tyrosine kinase have been previously identified using high-throughoutput screening, we demonstrate here that these two kinases work together to control the egfr signaling pathway. indeed, crkl has been described as an "essential cancer-causing gene" in  <dig> cancer cell lines representing diverse cancer types
 <cit> . in agreement with this observation, crkl expression has been correlated with aggressive and malignant behavior of cancer cells, making crkl a potential cancer marker and therapeutic target
 <cit> . similarly, the fer non-receptor tyrosine kinase has been previously associated with cell proliferation and cancer
. fer was initially discovered in studies focusing on the proto-oncogene fes/fps and was shown to play a critical role in cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. fer has been associated with signaling complexes containing insulin receptor substrate- <dig>  igf1r and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
 <cit> . canonical igf-ir/irs <dig> signaling is activated through the binding of irs <dig> to phosphorylated igf-ir, resulting in the activation of the erk/hif-1α/nf-κb signaling pathway
 <cit> . as demonstrated in figure 
 <dig>  irs <dig> and igf1r respectively interact with fer and crkl, providing additional evidence for crosstalk between fer and crkl in the activation of the erk/hif-1α/nf-κb signaling pathway.

to validate and further investigate the effects of crkl and fer, we analyzed cell-cycle progression in two proliferating cell lines: the cervical cancer hela cell line and the huh <dig> human hepatoma cell line. huh <dig> cells are highly proliferating cells in which signaling pathways are strongly activated in response to extracellular stimuli
 <cit> . crkl and fer expressions were silenced using  <dig> different sirnas per targeted gene and progression through the g1/s phase was analyzed by edu  and/or methyl-3h thymidine incorporation in sirna-inhibited vs. control cells. the efficiency of sirna was validated by the 85% and 90% decrease in the expression levels of crkl and fer in hela and huh <dig> cell lines, respectively . as shown in figure 
7c, d and e, crkl and fer silencing induced a strong decrease in edu and methyl-3h thymidine incorporation in both hela and huh <dig> cells, highlighting a decrease in dna replication. in addition, these effects were associated with a decrease in erk phosphorylation  and ki <dig> expression  thereby suggesting the implication of fer and crkl in regulation of cell proliferation through mitogenic erk-dependent pathways. to illustrate the cell cycle distribution with knockdown of crkl and fer, we analyzed the cyclin d <dig> which plays a critical role in late g <dig> phase progression. we showed that cyclin d <dig> expression accumulated in crkl and fer silenced cells while expression of cdk <dig> was not changed compared to controls. these data, together with methyl-thymidine inhibitions, support evidences for the implication of crkl and fer in late g <dig> and g1/s transition .figure  <dig> 
implication of the fer and crkl kinases in s-phase replication of hela and huh <dig> cells. cells were transfected with fer, crkl or control sirnas and analyzed 72 h post-transfection. , western blot analysis of fer and crkl expression in hela  and huh <dig> . , representative fluorescence microcopy images from hela cells . , cell proliferation assay. edu or methyl-thymidine incorporations were performed 72 h  and 96 h  after transfections of hela  and huh <dig>  cells. replication is expressed as the proliferation index  and cpm/μg of protein . the statistical significance was  and  in hela and huh <dig> cells, respectively, relative to the control sirna.



interestingly we further observed a diminished migration of cells silenced for fer and crkl  that confirm and extend previous work showing that crkl and fer could be associated with the metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma  cells. phosphoproteomic techniques based on lc-ms/ms and protein-protein interactions in crosstalk pathways first implicated fer in the invasive ability of metastatic hepatoma cells
 <cit> . more recently, liu et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated that crkl could be a novel prognostic marker in hcc, whereby knockdown of crkl in hcc cells leads to a decrease in cell migration and in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. in addition, high expression levels of crkl and of the crkl-flt <dig> complex  strongly correlate with reduced disease-free and overall survival in hcc patients. together these data demonstrate that targeting fer and crkl might constitute a promising new therapeutic approach.

CONCLUSIONS
unlike previous rnai-based screens, we have developed an original integrative data analysis to identify kinases required for cell proliferation. using ontology annotation, we first identified two functional kinase groups differentially implicated in the control of cell proliferation by regulating either the cell cycle and cell division or, more broadly, signaling pathways. second, we integrated signaling kinases with protein and phosphoproteomic interactions to generate a global view of kinase networks, including substrates and interacting proteins. network analysis then allows for the identification of functional modules that regroup kinases working together. this is the case for fer and crkl, which control mitogenic erk-dependent signaling pathways.

targeting specific signaling kinases that control cell proliferation has been developed as a strategy for cancer therapy, but resistance often emerges as a major impediment to effective chemotherapy. systems biology approaches are necessary to take into account signaling complexity and to implement effective combinatorial therapies. the simple framework proposed in this work should serve as a useful basis to improve our understanding and interpretation of screening data and to facilitate the identification of new kinase functionalities that can in turn be used as part of new therapeutic strategies.
