BACKGROUND
the two major forms of novel immune-type receptors  possess either one n-terminal ectodomain of the ig variable  type, which may contain a joining  or j-like sequence or an n-terminal v domain plus a second c-terminal ig domain of the intermediate  type. most nitrs are predicted to encode type i transmembrane cell surface proteins that possess extracellular immunoglobulin  domains and can be classified as inhibitory or activating. a smaller number of nitr genes lack a transmembrane domain and are predicted to be secreted proteins  <cit> . nitrs are expressed in several different hematopoietic lineages  <cit>  and their overall structure and cytoplasmic signaling resemble the mammalian natural killer cell receptors   <cit> . nitrs have been reported to bind allogeneic cell surface targets, although their precise ligand specificity is not clear . other observations, including upregulation of transcription in response to pathogens, support a role for nitrs in immunity  <cit> .

nitrs were identified initially in the compact genome of the southern pufferfish ; more than  <dig> nitr genes were shown to be encoded in a single gene cluster  <cit> . subsequent analysis of the zebrafish  genome revealed one large nitr gene cluster encoding  <dig> nitrs on chromosome  <dig> and a second smaller nitr gene cluster encoding  <dig> nitrs on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . nitr cdnas also have been characterized from channel catfish , rainbow trout  and japanese flounder   <cit>  and it is assumed that they are present in all bony fish. the majority of nitrs possess cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs ; inhibitory functions have been confirmed in vitro  <cit> . a smaller number of nitrs possess a positively charged residue within their transmembrane domain and have been shown to interact with dap <dig> through which they mediate an activating function  <cit> .

we herein report the identification of  <dig> medaka  nitr genes, which can be classified into  <dig> families including inhibitory and activating forms; this represents nearly twice the number of nitr families that have been identified in any other species. the resolution of this dataset of nitrs along with the previous genomic resolution of nitrs in zebrafish permits a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis as well as the examination of shared synteny. the nitrs emerge as independent families of immune-type receptors in which the evolution of the v regions exhibit considerable similarity to that seen in multigene families encoding ig, tcrs and kirs.

RESULTS
medaka encode  <dig> nitrs on three chromosomes
the reduced levels of protein sequence identity between nitrs found in different species make it difficult to identify genetic orthologs between fish species outside of conserved core residues. in order to identify nitr genes from medaka, we data mined the recently released medaka genome database  <cit> . by using zebrafish nitr sequences as queries, it was possible to identify a number of candidate genes that encode ig domains. by then restricting the queries only to genes that encode an authentic nitr i-type domain  <cit> , nitr gene clusters were identified on medaka chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the search was then directed to include all genes predicted to encode v domains in these genomic regions. in total,  <dig> nitr genes were identified on chromosome 10;  <dig> nitr genes and three pseudogenes  were identified on chromosome 18; and one nitr gene and one pseudogene were identified on chromosome  <dig> . three additional nitr genes  cannot be assigned to a specific chromosome. it is possible that certain genes described here may represent allelic variants and that additional nitr genes may be identified in future releases of the medaka genome.

the  <dig> nitr genes that were identified can be grouped into  <dig> v families, based on >70% predicted amino acid sequence identity . twelve families consist of multiple  members and the remaining families are singletons. each nitr family was assigned a number and for families with multiple members, each member was assigned a letter  as described  <cit> . with the exception of the nitr <dig> family  in which activating potential  served as the basis for assignment to a specific gene family, unequivocal orthologs between the nitrs of medaka and any other species were not identified and the numbering of these genes was arbitrary.

two major classes of nitr gene organization
all of the nitr genes currently described from the southern pufferfish and  <dig> nitr genes from a second pufferfish species, tetraodon nigroviridis , encode two ig domains  in a single exon  <cit> . in contrast, all of the two-ig domain nitr genes described from zebrafish encode the v and i domains in two exons  <cit> . both types of nitr gene organization are present in medaka . the medaka nitr genes encoding two ig domains in a single exon are all located on chromosomes  <dig> and 21; the medaka nitr genes encoding two ig domains in two exons are located on chromosome  <dig> with the exception of the nitr <dig> genes, which are on chromosome  <dig> 

twenty-one full-length nitr cdnas were cloned from medaka kidney and spleen by 3' race using nested primers that include the predicted translational start codon  in order to verify the exon-intron boundaries for the nitrs. the predicted exon-intron boundaries most often were verified; however, in several cases, predicted mrna splice sites were inexact, reflected slight differences in cdna sequence. it is likely that the genome from inbred hd-rr medaka and cdnas from the out-bred orange-red medaka line possess different alleles for certain nitrs. for example, the identification of a nitr <dig> cdna from the orange-red line confirms that the nitr <dig> genes possess a cytoplasmic tail; however, the cdna cytoplasmic sequence is too divergent to confidently predict these exons from the hd-rr genome. in addition the orange-red nitr <dig> cdna encodes additional nucleotide sequences that are not present in the hd-rr genome resulting in a stop codon preventing translation of an itim-like sequence  in the cdna .

structural features of medaka nitrs
the initial search criteria for identifying medaka nitrs was directed to the i domain, which possesses six highly conserved cysteines. nitr <dig> and nitr <dig> lack the sixth and third cysteines, respectively . a joining  or j-like peptide sequence at the carboxyl-terminus of either the v and/or the i domain is a conserved feature of nearly all medaka nitrs . the majority of nitrs in medaka and other species can be classified as inhibitory based on the presence of one or two cytoplasmic itim or itim sequences  as well as by the absence of a charged transmembrane residue, a conserved feature of activating receptors. in medaka, three closely related nitr genes  possess a charged residue  within their transmembrane domain corresponding to activating nitrs in other species such as nitr <dig>  the single activating nitr gene in zebrafish   <cit> .

nitr gene clusters in medaka and zebrafish share conserved synteny
the complete annotation of nitrs in zebrafish and medaka permits the investigation of potential shared synteny. the larger zebrafish nitr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> is adjacent to the map4k2l, men <dig> and rtn <dig> genes  <cit>  and the larger medaka nitr gene cluster is linked to these genes on chromosome  <dig> . the second smaller zebrafish nitr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> is adjacent to the fgfrl1b gene  <cit>  and the medaka nitr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> is tightly linked to fgfrl <dig> within the same contig .  and fgfrl <dig> in medaka). medaka orthologs of additional genes adjacent to the nitr gene cluster on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> are also encoded on medaka chromosome  <dig> . these observations indicate that the nitr gene clusters on medaka chromosome  <dig> and zebrafish chromosome  <dig> share conserved synteny whereas the nitr gene cluster on medaka chromosome  <dig> and zebrafish chromosome  <dig> share conserved synteny. the origin of the third, smaller nitr gene cluster on medaka chromosome  <dig> is not evident, as zebrafish only possess two nitr gene clusters.

orthologous genes were defined by ensembl. zebrafish gene order was determined with version zv <dig> of the zebrafish genome and ensembl.

a bony fish spon2/fgfrl1/nitr locus shares conserved synteny with the spon2/fgfrl1/cd <dig> locus in xenopus and chicken
nitrs have not been identified outside of bony fish and their evolutionary origins remain unresolved. the genomes of human, chicken, xenopus tropicalis and a third fish species stickleback  were queried in an effort to identify genomic regions, which share conserved synteny with the nitr gene clusters. in medaka, zebrafish and stickleback, one nitr gene cluster is linked to spon <dig> and fgfrl <dig> orthologs. in chicken and xenopus the spon <dig> and fgfrl <dig> genes are physically linked to the cd8a/cd8b locus . spon2/fgfrl <dig> and cd8a/cd8b genes are on different chromosomes in human. in medaka, zebrafish and stickleback the cd8a/cd8b locus does not display conserved synteny to human . the observation that spon <dig> and fgfrl are linked to the cd <dig> locus in chicken and xenopus and that spon <dig> and fgfrl orthologs are linked to a nitr gene cluster in medaka, zebrafish and stickleback is consistent with a common ancestry for these immune-type molecules.

medaka nitr <dig> is tightly linked to a ctla <dig> ortholog
the nitr <dig> locus on medaka chromosome  <dig> is separated from the v-domain receptor ctla <dig> by ~ <dig>  mb. a small number of predicted olfactory receptor genes lie between ctla <dig> and nitr <dig> . although mammalian ctla <dig> is tightly linked to cd <dig>  a structurally similar receptor, these genes do not appear to be closely linked in bony fish  <cit> . neither nitr gene cluster in zebrafish is linked to ctla <dig> or cd <dig> 

species-specific expansions of nitr families
in general, most nitrs from a single species lack clear orthologs in other species. the absence of such comparison sets skews multi-species phylogenetic comparisons as not all nitr members from each species  have been identified. three major inferences can be made from the data described here  and other observations predicted previously: 1) the activating receptors, medaka nitr <dig>  zebrafish nitr <dig>  and catfish ipnitr <dig>  group together suggesting a common ancestry; 2) the majority of the nitrs encoding both v and i domains within a single exon  group together, suggesting that they are likely derived from a common ancestral gene; and 3) the majority of the nitrs, which lack an i domain , group together, suggesting that they too may be derived from a common ancestral gene.

multiple species-specific expansions of individual nitr families are revealed by comparing the two complete nitr datasets from medaka and zebrafish . for example, the medaka nitr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> includes expansions of the nitr <dig>  nitr <dig>  nitr <dig> and nitr <dig> families and the corresponding zebrafish nitr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> includes expansions of the divergent nitr <dig>  nitr <dig> and nitr <dig> families. three nitrs are encoded by the zebrafish nitr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> whereas  <dig> nitrs are encoded by the corresponding gene cluster in medaka suggesting either gene loss in zebrafish or gene duplications in medaka.

discussion
interpreting the evolution of nitrs within teleost species
forty-four different nitr genes, the majority of which are inhibitory, are present in the medaka genome. perhaps the most striking observation relates to the high degree of variation between these v domains within medaka and their diversification from nitrs in other fish species. this finding is particularly striking given the exceptionally large number of v families in medaka, i.e., the greater the number of v families present, the higher the expectations of identifying orthologous sequences. the medaka/zebrafish chromosomes 18/ <dig> and 10/ <dig>  which encode the larger nitr gene clusters, exhibit a high degree of conserved synteny  <cit> . medaka chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and zebrafish chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> likely derive from a hypothetical ancestral chromosome termed "f" which was duplicated prior to the divergence of medaka and zebrafish  <cit> . although the nucleotide identity is low between medaka and zebrafish nitr genes , conserved synteny between the two primary medaka and zebrafish nitr gene clusters is impressive.

comparisons of predicted amino acid sequence structures within and between different species indicate that nitrs are undergoing family-specific expansions and individual genes are undergoing birth and death events. as the nitr gene products are highly diverse within a single species  and approximately 10% of the nitrs described in medaka can be classified as pseudogenes , it is less likely that concerted evolution played a primary role in establishing the current nitr sequences  <cit> . birth and death events of nitr genes likely have been occurring continuously after the divergence of medaka and zebrafish ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . similar observations have been made concerning the v gene segments of the ig and tcr genes  <cit>  and the kir genes within primate species . the kir gene family is of particular value in comparative interpretations as they also represent type i, ig domain-containing membrane proteins with potential for inhibitory and activating signalling. kirs are highly polymorphic and polygenic within single species and drastically diverged in gene sequence and number between different primates  <cit> . the nature of diversity in kirs is markedly similar to that observed in the nitrs of medaka and zebrafish. the studies reported here suggest that particularly extensive expansion and diversification of the nitrs have occurred in bony fish. deducing the status of the nitr gene family from the genomes of more basal fish species  will be highly informative regarding the origins of diversity within the nitr family.

possible links between nitrs and mammalian receptors
all evidence to date strongly suggests that nitrs are restricted to bony fish. although nitrs possess authentic v  domains reminiscent of tcr, their overall structure, genomic organization and the presence of both activating and inhibitory forms, has led to the hypothesis that they may be functional equivalents to mammalian nk receptors, resembling in some way kirs. we previously reported that the zebrafish nitr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> shares a limited syntenic relationship with the mammalian leukocyte receptor cluster  that includes the kirs  <cit> . the new data presented here introduces two alternative models in which the nitrs share a common ancestry with cd8a/cd8b or with cd28/ctla <dig>  an expansion of cd8a-like genes was recently described within the chicken cd8a/cd8b locus; the reported structural similarity between the v-like domains of the cd8a-like receptors and nitrs supports the former model  <cit> . although intriguing, the latter model is not as well supported. specifically, in mammals cd <dig> and ctla <dig> effect opposing roles in t-cell stimulation and are encoded by adjacent genes. however, the cd <dig> and ctla <dig> genes are not physically linked in teleosts. linkage of an nitr gene to ctla <dig> has not been identified outside of medaka; in zebrafish the nitr gene clusters are on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . ctla <dig> and cd <dig> genes in zebrafish are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

kirs, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and ctla <dig> are expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes and nitrs are similarly expressed in lymphoid populations including nk-like cytotoxic cells . in general, inhibitory natural killer cells receptors  repress cytotoxicity by recognition of mhc or other markers of "self" on candidate target cells whereas activating nkrs induce cytotoxicity by detecting a loss of "self" or a gain of "non-self" . in at least one case, a nitr specifically engages a non-self determinant , suggesting the possibility that they may be involved in cytotoxic interactions. ongoing efforts to identify nitr ligands and define cell populations that express nitrs in vivo will prove crucial in deciphering their role in immunity. in particular, such studies will determine whether their function is analogous to mammalian processes  or represents a unique adaptation within bony fish.

CONCLUSIONS
the medaka genome encodes  <dig> nitr genes in  <dig> gene clusters. nitr genes in this species are divergent in sequence but structurally similar to those characterized in other fish species and include both inhibitory and activating forms. comparative genomics reveals three possible scenarios in which the nitrs share a common genetic ancestry with cd <dig>  cd28/ctla <dig> or kirs. a comparison of the complete sets of nitrs from medaka and zebrafish indicate that: 1) the two largest nitr gene clusters in medaka and zebrafish are derived from a whole chromosome duplication event, 2) as a gene family, the nitrs have experienced recent, species-specific "birth and death" events and 3) nitr family expansions have led to high levels of sequence variation between fish species.
