BACKGROUND
metals are common in our environment and diet. rocks and soils are the principal and natural sources of metals in the environment. these sources lead to natural background levels in soils, sediments, waters and organisms that are supplemented by many human activities like agriculture  and industrial activities . some metals are essential trace elements, however, many are toxic to organisms. the essential elements are acquired from the environment depending on the necessities and their uptake is strictly controlled by homeostasis. failure of these regulation mechanisms due to metal deficiency or toxicity  results in harmful effects on the organism. mechanisms to resist metals are abundant and widespread in bacteria, with resistance determinants occurring in a few percent in pristine environments to in nearly all isolates in heavily polluted environments  <cit> .

cupriavidus metallidurans is a species characterized by multiple metal-resistances  <cit> . for c. metallidurans type strain ch <dig> a substantial part of the metal resistance mechanisms are carried by its two megaplasmids pmol <dig> and pmol <dig>  <cit> . however, next to these specialized plasmids also chromosomally-encoded metal responsive gene clusters have been identified  <cit> . the c. metallidurans ch <dig> genome  <cit>  hosts in addition a large diversity of mobile genetic elements  including genomic islands , integrative and conjugative elements, transposons and insertion sequence  elements  <cit> . both the number and diversity of genes related to mges is larger in type strain ch <dig> than in related strains from other cupriavidus and ralstonia genera  <cit> . multiple gis, in particular on both plasmids, contain genes for heavy metal resistance  <cit> . its capacity to degrade toluene, to fix carbon dioxide and to oxidize hydrogen is located on tn4371-like integrative and conjugative elements  <cit> .

c. metallidurans strains were often isolated from industrial sites linked to mining-, metallurgical-, and chemical industries  <cit> . next to this, c. metallidurans strains were isolated from environments not typified by metal contamination like, for instance, from different spacecraft-related environments  <cit> , from patients with cystic fibrosis  <cit>  or even as the causative agent of an invasive human infection  <cit> .

in this study, we aimed to gain insight in the dispersion and horizontal transfer of genes and the evolutionary forces shaping this species. therefore, whole-genome oligonucleotide dna microarrays based on the genome of ch <dig> were used to compare  <dig> c. metallidurans strains isolated from diverse metal-contaminated biotopes, from other anthropogenic environments and from human cerebrospinal fluid with type strain ch <dig> 

RESULTS
general comparison
comparative whole-genome hybridization  was applied to compare sixteen c. metallidurans strains  with type strain ch <dig> and showed that all strains shared a core of  <dig> coding sequences , which represents  <dig> % of the  <dig> oligonucleotide probes present on the ch <dig> microarray. this common gene pool represented  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> , pmol <dig> and pmol <dig>  respectively. thus, although the main replicon  carries most of the housekeeping genes  <cit> , only a slightly higher percentage of cds is conserved in chr <dig> compared to chr <dig>  this is different when comparing the sequenced cupriavidus species , for which the percentage of common genes is much larger for chr <dig> than for chr <dig>  <cit> .

within this conserved group  <dig> cds were assigned to a cluster of orthologous groups . the most abundant cog functional categories were function unknown , amino acid transport and metabolism , general function prediction only , transcription  and energy production and conversion , respectively.

cluster analysis based on the pairwise number of overlapping orthologs indicated that all strains can clearly be clustered into two main groups . the strains isolated from the mine tailings in congo  grouped together with sv <dig> isolated from a metal factory in belgium and with kt <dig> from a wastewater treatment plant in germany. this cluster grouped together with a cluster comprising type strain ch <dig> and the other two isolates kt <dig> and kt <dig> from the wastewater treatment plant in germany forming group i . group ii included the strains isolated from the spacecraft-related environments , as well as 31a  and ch <dig>  from metal factories, the clinical strain  <dig> , and strain  <dig> from pharmaceutics . interestingly, type strain ch <dig> did not group with the two other strains  isolated from the same site in belgium.

mobile genetic elements
all strains  carried one or more megaplasmids . concordantly, a good overall conservation of pmol <dig> and pmol <dig> genes was observed. cgh indicated that for pmol <dig> genes in general between  <dig> and 99% of the probes showed a positive hybridization signal except for ch <dig> , 31a ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . for kt <dig>  99% or  <dig> out of  <dig> gave a positive hybridization signal. for ch <dig>  31a,  <dig> and  <dig>  a higher percentage of positive hybridization signals was observed for the genomic islands cmgi-30a and cmgi-30b carried by pmol <dig> than for the plasmid backbone, indicating that the megaplasmid in these strains probably do not carry a backbone similar to pmol <dig>  the pmol <dig> genes are less conserved than those from pmol <dig> but still in general between  <dig> and 95% with the highest number of positive cgh signals for kt <dig>  and kt <dig>  . conservation below 70% was observed for ch <dig> , ch <dig> , ne <dig>  and na <dig> . more positive hybridization signals were found for the gis on pmol <dig> than the plasmid backbone, indicating that their megaplasmids probably do not carry a backbone similar to pmol <dig>  concordantly, strains lacking either the pmol <dig> backbone , the pmol <dig> backbone  or both  have only one or no megaplasmid . strain 31a, which carries two megaplasmids ptom <dig> and ptom <dig>  <cit> , showed only a positive hybridization signal with the pmol <dig> backbone, indicating that one of both has a backbone related to pmol <dig> while the other has a backbone unrelated to pmol <dig>

the strong conservation of the gis on pmol <dig>  and pmol <dig>  which carry all the metal resistance determinants of these plasmids, already indicated a high conservation of the metal responsive clusters .

next to the megaplasmids and their gis, ch <dig> carries  <dig> previously identified gis on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . based on cgh data analysis for the presence of gis, the strains could again be divided into two main groups. one group  carried almost all gis identified in ch <dig>  while these gis were much less abundant in the second group  . this clustering  resembled the clustering based on all oligonucleotide probes , which indicated that the presence of gis is the main source of divergence in these strains. at least  <dig> strains carried cmgi- <dig> . cmgi- <dig> of ch <dig> is a  <dig> kb gi of the pagi- <dig> family and is almost 100% identical to pagi- <dig> c of p. aeruginosa clone c isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient  <cit> . these data are in agreement with the analysis of the kt and ch strains by klockgether et al.  <cit> . the relative occurrence also indicated that cmgi- <dig> and cmgi- <dig> to cmgi- <dig> were highly conserved when present. cmgi- <dig> to cmgi- <dig> belong to the tn <dig> family  <cit>  and were previously designated icetn <dig>  icetn <dig> and Δicetn <dig>  respectively  <cit> . cmgi- <dig>  and cmgi- <dig>  are responsible for ch34's ability to grow on aromatic compounds and to fix carbon dioxide, respectively. the presence of these gis in the c. metallidurans strains is in accordance with their ability to degrade toluene or to grow on hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide . except for ne <dig> that apparently lacks the genes involved in degradation of aromatic compounds but is able to degrade toluene and vice versa for as <dig> that apparently carries the genes but lacked degradation ability. therefore, ne <dig> putatively carries other functional genes, while for as <dig> functionality is probably lost. finally, the presence of other tn4371-like elements in these strains can not be excluded. especially since all strains except ch <dig>  31a and na <dig> displayed good conservation of the partial cmgi- <dig> , which lacks the transfer module  <cit> , and displayed positive hybridization signals related to the transfer module of cmgi- <dig> 

the mosaic structure of the second chromosome of c. metallidurans ch <dig>  but also other cupriavidus, ralstonia and burkholderia strains, made it complicated to clearly identify gis on this replicon. consequently, no gis on chromosome  <dig> of c. metallidurans ch <dig> were defined in a previous study  <cit> . here we took advantage of the clear pattern of gi distribution in chromosome  <dig> over the  <dig> different c. metallidurans strains to scan chromosome  <dig> for similar patterns , which could be an indication for the presence of a genomic island. five different gis could be identified . interestingly, in ch <dig> both cmgi-b and cmgi-d flank a copy of the tn <dig> transposon. it was previously shown that in ch <dig> a chromosomal inversion occurred by recombination between the pair of tn <dig> transposons  <cit> . therefore, cmgi-b and cmgi-d are in fact two parts of the same genomic island of  <dig>  kb with at one extremity multiple genes coding for phage-related proteins  and at the other extremity a cluster of  <dig> genes in synteny with r. solanacearum. accordingly, the relative occurrence of cmgi-b was comparable to that of cmgi-d for each strain, and both were conserved  in  <dig> strains . in ch <dig>  the  <dig> kb cmgi-e carries at one extremity an isrme <dig>  three tn7-related genes  and an isrme <dig> inserted into tnsc. in fact a very small gene cluster  in chromosome  <dig> carried a isrme <dig> and two tn7-related genes . furthermore, for each strain the presence of these genes coincides with the presence of tnsabc. to determine the relation between these distant tn7-related genes, the string database  was used to find genomes where these genes occur as immediate neighbors. this identified with high confidence  orthologous groups of tnsabcd <dig> in anabaena variabilis and of tnsabcd <dig> in hahella chejuensis, shigella sonnei and idiomarina loihiensis. additional blastp searches indicated the presence of this cluster also in strains more closely related to ch <dig> such as burkholderia phymatum and herminiimonas arsenicoxydans . these results evidenced that a putative chromosomal inversion of a very large region  occurred in ch <dig> by recombination between the pair of isrme <dig> elements. in fact, before inversion the region formed a genomic island with a set of tn7-encoded proteins  at one extremity and accessory genes putatively involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds.

the above described observations also encouraged us to scrutinize once more chromosome  <dig> of ch <dig> for putative genomic islands . in addition to the previously identified islands  <cit> , at least two other putative gis could be identified . cmgi- <dig> carries genes coding for hypothetical proteins and is flanked by direct repeats . cmgi- <dig> carries genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, however, no genes putatively involved in mobility could be identified.

the occurrence of insertion sequences in the different c. metallidurans strains followed the same trend as that of the gis. based on cgh the same two main clusters could be derived. one group  displayed positive hybridization signals for  <dig> to 98% of the  <dig> probes related to is elements, while the second group  only displayed  <dig> to 62% positive signals .

the occurrence of transposon tn <dig> displayed the same pattern as for the is elements and gis, however, tn <dig> and the mercury transposons  appear to be present in all strains .

heavy metal resistance genes
the presence of all gene clusters, which are identified in ch <dig> as involved in heavy metal detoxification, was evaluated in the genomes of the other strains . almost all metal responsive clusters where found in the other isolates, however, some clusters did not fully correspond to those from ch <dig>  the metal resistance arsenal of ch <dig> is most conserved in kt <dig> followed by kt <dig>  as <dig>  as <dig> and sv <dig>  these strains also grouped into a separate cluster based on total genome comparison .

aonly genes that did not display positive hybridization signals are shown. bsee ref.  <cit>  for the extensive and descriptive table with metal detoxifications in c. metallidurans ch <dig>  cunderlined genes are regulators; dinsertion , frameshift and truncation are indicated by ,  and , respectively. *complete cluster is copvtkmnsrabcdijgfolqhew; #znic  and znec .

a noticeable phenotypic difference was observed for nickel, chromate and lead resistance compared to ch <dig> . for most isolates, including ch <dig>  the maximum tolerable nickel concentration is around  <dig> mm, however, this concentration is much higher for na <dig>  kt <dig>  kt <dig>  kt <dig> and 31a . for strains 31a and kt <dig>  it has been shown that the nccyxhcban locus is responsible for the resistance to  <dig> mm nickel  <cit> . the ncccba locus in ch <dig> bears a frameshift in nccb indicating that the ncc genes probably are not functional  <cit> . the pmol28-encoded chromate cluster  is almost completely absent in strains ch <dig> and ch <dig> . concordantly, the maximum tolerable chromate concentration for these strains is around  <dig>  mm, while this concentration is around  <dig>  mm for the other strains . similarly, the pmol30-encoded lead cluster  is almost completely absent in strains  <dig> and  <dig> , resulting in a lower mtc compared to the other strains .

strain ch <dig> carries several metal resistance genes that are putatively inactivated by frame shift mutation , truncation or insertion by an is element or transposon . the presence of three different insertions was evaluated for all isolates, specifically  insertion of is <dig> between hmya and hmyb  transporter),  insertion of isrme <dig> in nima , and  insertion of tn <dig> in pbru .

the presence of these insertions followed the same trend as the occurrence of insertion sequences . insertions of is <dig>  isrme <dig> and tn <dig> were present in strains kt <dig>  kt <dig>  kt <dig>  as <dig>  as <dig>  as <dig> and sv <dig> but not in strains ch <dig>  ch <dig>  31a, ne <dig>  na <dig>  na <dig>  na <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the occurrence of an insertion in nimbac, which codes for a rnd transporter putatively involved in the resistance to ni2+ and co2+  <cit> , does not clearly influence the mtc of nickel or cobalt, however, the presence of other  ni2+ and co2+ resistance determinants could mask this. similarly, the occurrence of an insertion in pbru is not univocally related to a lower mtc . finally, it should be noted that potentially additional metal resistance determinants could be present in the other strains, which are undetectable with a cgh array based on the ch <dig> genome.

genes encoding sigma factors and small stress responsive proteins
no less than  <dig> different sigma factors were identified in c. metallidurans ch <dig>  which enable specific binding of rna polymerase to promoters, and are activated in response to different environmental changes  <cit> . generally, the number and diversity of sigma factor genes in a certain genome relates to the environmental variation allowing growth  <cit> , which thus indicates that c. metallidurans ch <dig> is able to respond to a broad range of environmental changes. cgh showed for all c. metallidurans strains positive signals for  <dig> sigma factors . hybridization signals below the threshold were found for the housekeeping sigma- <dig> factors rpod <dig> and rpod <dig> for strain as <dig>  kt <dig> and ch <dig>  and ne <dig>  na <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. sigma factor cnrh carried by plasmid pmol <dig> and encoded by the cnr gene cluster, which is involved in nickel resistance, was only observed for kt <dig>  31a, na <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  next to these, differences were observed for rpor , rpop  and rpoj .

another interesting group of genes in ch <dig> consists of  <dig> homologous genes encoding for putative small  stress responsive proteins in ch <dig>  which are likely to be secreted since all have a distinctive signal peptide and are apparently only found in cupriavidus and ralstonia species  <cit> . ten of these genes were found to be induced in response to different heavy metals  <cit>  like the pmol30-encoded copq  <cit>  and czcj  <cit> , while three others were induced by hydrogen peroxide . cgh indicated that these genes are well conserved among c. metallidurans strains .

discussion
comparative whole-genome hybridization  was used to compare sixteen c. metallidurans strains isolated from different biotopes with type strain ch <dig>  although the nature of these sites differs, ranging from pharmaceutical and space industry to metal mining and metal industries, waste treatment plants and even human infection, at least the oligotrophic aspect is common.

the global comparison indicated that while chromosome  <dig> is the ancestral replicon of the cupriavidus genus, chromosome  <dig> appears to be more specific to and conserved within the c. metallidurans species. these results are in agreement with the study of bavishi and colleagues  <cit> , which indicated that chromosome  <dig> evolves faster than chromosome  <dig>  leading to different conservation on inter- and intraspecies level. this global comparison also indicated that strain ch <dig> is more closely related to strains isolated from congo than with the two other strains  isolated in belgium. this supports an old assumption that strain ch <dig> was transported into belgium by the import of ores from congo, which was a belgian colony from  <dig> until  <dig> 

the incidence of mges showed a clear pattern as well as evident phenotypes carried by them like the degradation of toluene or the ability to grow on h <dig> and co <dig>  no clear correlation was found between the occurrence of some mges and isolation site characteristics and location . however, it was apparent that strains carried either most of the mges or only a few. interestingly, strains isolated from more hygienic settings like clinical, pharmaceutical or spacecraft environments carried almost no mges contrary to strains isolated from sites related to raw materials or environmental sources. this could indicate that either acquisition or loss of these mges was advantageous at one point enabling their spread in numerous environments and locations. for example, the mges related to hydrogenotrophy and degradation of toluene may recall to the volcanic origin  <cit>  and such mges may have been dispensable and lost in technologized environments. whereas mges with a putative link  to opportunistic infection were maintained, such as cmgi- <dig>  which is almost identical to the pagi- <dig> c island identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa clone c , and cmgi- <dig>  which carries fimbrial genes.

the clear presence or absence of a multitude of mges in this group of c. metallidurans strains allowed us to further scrutinize the genome of ch <dig> for mges, especially in the second chromosome. at least five additional regions could be identified with one island formed by a tn7-like transposon carrying accessory genes putatively involved in the degradation of certain aromatic compounds. genomic islands formed by tn7-like transposons have been identified in h. chejuensis, s. sonnei and i. loihiensis, in which tn <dig> inserted into the atttn <dig> site adjacent to a glms gene  <cit> . in c. metallidurans ch <dig> this tn7-like element is not found within the atttn <dig> site and in addition lacks the tnse gene and possesses two distinct tnsd genes. parks and peters  <cit>  showed that the presence of two distinct tnsd genes is common in tn7-like elements that are not found within the atttn <dig> site and hypothesized that one of the tnsd proteins might actually allow non-specific target site recognition.

both the cgh and physiological data indicated that the heavy metal resistance determinants identified in c. metallidurans ch <dig> are well conserved among other c. metallidurans strains. this strong conservation was also observed for genes encoding small stress responsive proteins and sigma factors, of which at least a part are involved in metal resistance  <cit> .

the incidence of these metal resistance determinants could, however, not be directly related to their isolation source  nor location . this indicates that these resistance determinants are probably acquired earlier in evolution, which is consistent with the hypothesis that toxic metal resistance systems are preexistent to the recent anthropogenic activities and arose soon after life began, in a world already polluted by volcanic activities  <cit> . however, taking into account that most of the metal determinants are on the native megaplasmids and the gis thereon, it could be argued that anthropogenic activities and technologized environments provided a selective pressure for the conservation of these determinants or even the acquisition of some, considering both the arsenal of determinants as well as the level of resistance to metals. putatively, these determinants may even render a higher fitness in infections as these megaplasmids, despite their fitness cost, are also present in strains isolated from human infections. the structural and functional characteristics that metal resistance systems share with antibiotic resistance systems could be significant for this  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our comparative study showed that most metal resistance determinants identified in c. metallidurans ch <dig> are common to all c. metallidurans strains irrespective of the strain's isolation type and place. c. metallidurans strains do display considerable differences in the diversity and size of their mobile gene pool, which reflects at least some metabolic properties.
