BACKGROUND
dystrophin, identified nearly  <dig> years ago as the protein deficient in duchenne muscular dystrophy  <cit> , is now recognised as the founder member of a protein superfamily with representatives throughout the animal kingdom <cit> . the ~70-kda signature structure of this family is a compact cluster of domains comprising four ef-hand motifs and a zz-domain, followed by a looser region with a propensity to form coiled-coils. in the case of dystrophin and its close paralogue utrophin <cit> , this structure has a large n-terminal extension of actin-binding ch domains and up to  <dig> spectrin repeats. the use of internal promoters and alternative splicing of genes encoding both of these proteins enables the generation of multiple n-terminally truncated isoforms of varying length. drp <dig> is a further paralogue which retains only two of the spectrin repeats <cit> . dystrophin, utrophin and drp <dig> together constitute the vertebrate members of the dystrophin branch of the superfamily; although their function is not well understood, they each  form the core of a membrane-bound complex comprising dystroglycan, sarcoglycans and syntrophins, known as the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex   <cit> . loss of dystrophin and other components of the dgc causes disorders of the nervous and muscular tissues <cit> . loss of utrophin in mouse gives a very subtle phenotype but exacerbates the consequences of dystrophin loss <cit> . the consequences of drp <dig> deficiency are unknown.

dystrobrevins, also part of the dgc, show ~30% identity to dystrophins, and form the other branch of the superfamily. these lack the long n-terminal extension of the dystrophins, and are little longer than the superfamily signature structure itself. vertebrates have two paralogous dystrobrevins, α- and β-dystrobrevin  <cit> . α-dystrobrevin has a characteristic c-terminal extension and a range of isoforms which rivals dystrophin's; loss of function results in a phenotype similar to that found in dystrophin mutants <cit> . combined loss of α- and β-dystrobrevin results in a combination of skeletal myopathy and behavioural disorders <cit> .

invertebrates, as is the case with many gene families, have a simpler repertoire of proteins; all metazoans so far examined  have a single dystrophin and a single dystrobrevin <cit> . mutant phenotypes so far described tend to be of a synaptic form; loss of dystrophin or dystrobrevin in nematodes results in a hypersensitivity to acetylcholine <cit> , while dystrophin deficiency in flies alters the dynamics of neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction <cit> .

dystrophins and dystrobrevins interact directly with each other via homologous c-terminal coiled coil motifs <cit>  and depend strictly on each other for their localisation and incorporation into the dgc <cit> . it seems apparent that this heterodimeric partnership has arisen through an ancient duplication  of a single gene encoding a simple homodimeric protein <cit> , followed by structural and functional differentiation of the two proteins. the increased complexity of the vertebrate body has brought with it the need for further diversity of the repertoire of dgcs, such that there are three paralogous dystrophins with a combined total of at least  <dig> isoforms, two dystrobrevins with at least eight isoforms, five syntrophins instead of two, and six sarcoglycans instead of three.

we set out to assess the diversity of dystrophin- and dystrobrevin-related sequences throughout metazoa using a combination of bioinformatic analysis and experimental methods. our data enable us to clarify the serial duplication of the single invertebrate dystrophin gene to give rise to the vertebrate dystrophin, utrophin and drp <dig> genes; we also reveal the existence in fish  of a third dystrobrevin gene. we catalogue the extent of alternative splicing and alternative promoter use across vertebrate dystrophins and dystrobrevins, and we find that ascidians have an unexpectedly simplified dgc. perhaps most significantly, we report the discovery of an entirely new branch of the protein superfamily, dystrotelin, which is as distantly related to the dystrophins and dystrobrevins as they are to each other.

RESULTS
starting from known dystrophin- and dystrobrevin-related sequences, our principal approach was to use publicly available genome databases as a starting point from which to establish the likely extent of isoform- and paralogue-based diversity. predictions based on this were then tested experimentally and supplemented by acquiring further data that were not predictable from the databases. confirmed sequences were subjected to further bioinformatic analysis and, in the case of dystrotelin, to preliminary functional and expression analysis.

drp2
drp <dig> is a small vertebrate paralogue of dystrophin and utrophin, whose expression is largely confined to punctate structures in the cns <cit>  and patches between the cajal bands of schwann cells in the pns <cit> . its role in the cns is unknown, but in the pns drp <dig> interacts with l-periaxin via its spectrin repeats, and is reduced in a periaxin-deficient myelination disorder <cit> .

we compiled a set of sequences which is likely to encompass much of the drp <dig> diversity present in extant organisms. much of this was done by blast searches for obvious paralogous exons in available genomic and expressed sequence databases. in addition to this, certain critical sequences had to be obtained experimentally by 5'crace <cit> , namely the 5' end of a bony fish drp <dig> transcript , and the missing 40% of a cartilaginous fish drp <dig> . in order to establish whether the cartilaginous fish was the most divergent organism to possess drp <dig>  we also made extensive unsuccessful attempts to isolate drp2-related sequences from cyclostomes .

comparison of most of the drp <dig> sequence yields the unremarkable findings expected of a highly conserved vertebrate protein . the only point of interest is the drp2-specific elaboration of the n-terminus and its relationship to its paralogues dp <dig> and g-utrophin . an identifiable orthologue of the first human coding exon  was evident in eutherian mammals , a marsupial , a monotreme , a bird  and an amphibian . although the similarity at the genomic level was marginal for the last two species, these were both supported by ests . outside the tetrapod clade, it is striking that drp <dig> sequences only share high homology from human methionine  <dig> . the exonic region immediately 5' of this in three species of fish  also shows a highly conserved  sequence. in order to clarify whether met <dig> is the first in-frame atg in non-tetrapods, we performed 5'crace on drp <dig> rna from both the bony fish d. rerio  and from the cartilaginous fish s. canicula . in each case, met <dig> was the 5'-most in-frame methionine, preceded by at least one in-frame stop codon . this suggests that met <dig> is the ancestral drp <dig> start site, and that the tetrapod-specific 49–78-amino acid n-terminal region is a later acquisition, presumably with a specific function. however, initiator codon usage in any drp <dig> sequence is still to be confirmed experimentally, and usage may be tissue-specific.

clear similarity between the drp2s and other members of the dystrophin family begins at met <dig>  a residue which is conserved in all vertebrate dystrophins, utrophins and drp2s and all known insect dystrophins . drp2s possess two full spectrin repeats  paralogous to repeats  <dig> and  <dig> of human dystrophin, preceded by sequence equivalent to most of the last helix of repeat  <dig>  the gross structural resemblance between drp <dig>  dystrophin isoform dp <dig>  and utrophin isoform g-utrophin has been noted before <cit> , and it is clear from the similar sizes and reading frame phase of drp <dig> exon  <dig> and dystrophin and utrophin exon  <dig>  that this entire exon was duplicated during the ancestral formation of the drp <dig> gene, and that the sequence upstream of the ancestral drp <dig> start site  has subsequently diverged. it is also possible that the first exon of dp116/g-utrophin  was also duplicated in this event, and gave rise to the first coding exon  of the drp <dig> gene, though no similarity is expected to remain. it is notable that there is still some residual similarity at the amino acid level between the first exons of dp <dig> and g-utrophin .

the cyclostome dystrophin/utrophin ancestor
in order to resolve the point of divergence of the three paralogous vertebrate dystrophins , we acquired samples from three cyclostomes . we used the pan-dystrophin degenerate primers described previously <cit>  to perform rt-pcr on total brain rna. this gave a single dystrophin/utrophin-like sequence in each species, despite various attempts to isolate paralogous sequences . these failed attempts included a) use of degenerate rt-pcr primers capable of amplifying most vertebrate and many invertebrate dystrophin-related sequences, b) trying to bias the results of this rt-pcr towards drp <dig> by digesting the cdna with rare-cutting restriction enzymes targeted at the respective dystrophin/utrophin sequences, c) use of degenerate rt-pcr primers designed to recognise sequences specifically present in all vertebrate drp2s, and d) the use of samples from three different cyclostome species . while such negative results are necessarily weak, our widespread success at amplifying much more divergent sequences <cit>  encourages us to conclude that the cyclostomes do not express drp <dig> 

the m. glutinosa and p. marinus sequences were further extended by 3'race, yielding the natural stop codon . the cyclostome sequences were aligned with the most divergent gnathostome sequences , with amphioxus dystrophin <cit>  as an outgroup, and phylogenetic trees were generated . the cyclostome sequences consistently diverge after the duplication leading to drp <dig>  and tend to branch before the divergence of dystrophins and utrophins. this is consistent with the failure to detect a separate utrophin in cyclostomes, and suggests that the gnathostome dystrophin-like molecule is a descendent of the last common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin. all trees strongly support cyclostome monophyly, as has been repeatedly found with molecular data <cit> . we conclude that the possession of distinct dystrophin and utrophin molecules is a specifically gnathostome trait, arising from a duplication that occurred after our divergence from cyclostomes. the duplication which gave rise to the drp <dig> gene occurred before this point in time, but after the divergence from amphioxus; thus the last common ancestor of cyclostomes and gnathostomes had two dystrophin-like molecules, namely drp <dig> and a common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin. we assume that the cyclostomes have subsequently lost their drp <dig> gene .

the cyclostome sequences share an unsurprising set of mosaic ancestral and derived traits. the only features that warrant mention are the presence of exon  <dig> sequence, and the absence of a substantial chunk of the conserved c-terminus. the short exon  <dig> of mammalian dystrophin is alternatively spliced <cit>  and has homologues in all gnathostome dystrophins and utrophins  but not in drp2s or invertebrate dystrophins. its presence in the cyclostome sequences shows that it arose after the duplication that gave rise to drp <dig> but before the last common ancestor of cyclostomes and gnathostomes. the cyclostome dystrophin/utrophin sequences cease to be alignable with other members of the dystrophin family  soon after the beginning of exon  <dig> . this means that they lack not only the 39-residue "Δe78" c-terminus <cit>  that is present in all gnathostome dystrophins and most invertebrate dystrophins, but also a further ~ <dig> residues which are conserved in all dystrophins, utrophins and drp2s. the function of this missing region  is unknown, but clearly dispensable in cyclostomes.

dystrobrevins
most invertebrate metazoan genomes encode a single dystrobrevin-related molecule; the only exception that we found to this was the two ascidians  ciona intestinalis and ciona savignyi, neither of whose genome sequences contains a dystrobrevin-like gene . most vertebrates, on the other hand, appear to have two dystrobrevins, as has been previously described <cit> , named α- and β-dystrobrevin. this distinction is clear down to cartilaginous fish, where there are single examples of each type in sequence databases; torpedo californica sequence   <cit>  is an α-dystrobrevin, while squamus acanthias est  is a β-dystrobrevin. in addition to these two vertebrate dystrobrevins, we note, to our knowledge for the first time, the existence in bony fish of a third dystrobrevin, which we name γ-dystrobrevin.

while examining the public databases for fish dystrobrevin-related sequences, we found that all three completed teleost genomes  showed evidence for three distinct dystrobrevin genes, rather than two. one of these was clearly α-dystrobrevin, while the remaining two seemed superficially to resemble β-dystrobrevin. in phylogenetic analyses, one of these tended to cluster with other β-dystrobrevins , while the other failed to cluster with any known vertebrate dystrobrevins, suggesting that it was a novel paralogue. we verified the transcripts of all three dystrobrevins by rt-pcr and sequence analysis from d. rerio whole animal rna ; this also clarified and confirmed the exon structure. we named the novel paralogue γ-dystrobrevin by extrapolation from established nomenclature; it is well supported in several fish species by ests and is often mis-annotated as β-dystrobrevin .

a more refined phylogenetic analysis  clearly shows γ-dystrobrevin to represent an independent branch of the dystrobrevin family, separating from β-dystrobrevin earlier than the divergence of fish and tetrapods. the formation of three separate clusters  is supported in 100% of bootstrap trials, and branching of γ-dystrobrevin prior to the divergence of β-dystrobrevin and α-dystrobrevin is also robustly supported . this suggests that the last common ancestor of fish and tetrapods also had all three dystrobrevins, and that γ-dystrobrevin has been lost secondarily by tetrapods . like the β-dystrobrevins, the γ-dystrobrevins share the presumed ancestral state in lacking the α-dystrobrevin-specific c-terminal tyrosine-rich tail and exons  <dig> and  <dig>  apart from general sequence divergence, they have no particular features which differentiate them from the β-dystrobrevins. it is intriguing that while the fish β-dystrobrevins have lost exons 10– <dig>  the γ-dystrobrevins have retained the structure characteristic of tetrapod β-dystrobrevins .

in order to assess the gross expression of γ-dystrobrevin, we performed in situ hybridisation of d. rerio probes complementary to the 3'utrs of both dystrophin and γ-dystrobrevin. in  <dig> hours post fertilisation  embryos these two probes showed virtually indistinguishable patterns of hybridisation to the vertical myosepta , a pattern that has previously been reported for dystrophin <cit> . probes to neither α- nor β-dystrobrevin yield this pattern , suggesting that γ-dystrobrevin, like dystrophin, has a specific role in the myoseptum. it also tallies with the fact that a survey of the representation of the seven d. rerio superfamily members in the genbank est database shows that dystrophin and γ-dystrobrevin are by far the most abundant, with  <dig> and  <dig> hits, respectively , reflecting the preponderance of muscle tissue in this animal.

alternative promoter use and splicing
the mammalian dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin genes generate an impressive array of protein isoforms through the elaborate use of alternative splicing <cit> , alternative promoter use  <cit>  and alternative transcription termination <cit> . we set out to determine, by bioinformatics and rt-pcr, whether these isoform-generation mechanisms are conserved across the vertebrate clade .

alternative splicing of dystrophin exons 71–74
exons 71– <dig> undergo complex alternative splicing  in humans and mice  <cit> . this has been proposed <cit>  to regulate the stoichiometry of syntrophins in the dystrophin complex by removing their binding site. when we assessed by rt-pcr whether the same occurs in zebrafish, the only alternative splice event seen in this region was the omission of exon  <dig> . amplification of a product spanning exons 70– <dig> from whole animal rna from different developmental stages of zebrafish showed this to be temporally regulated, such that that the inclusion of exon  <dig> drops from > 90% in early embryos to < 60% in juvenile fish . thus the ability to regulate syntrophin stoichiometry is regulated across vertebrates, but by slightly different mechanisms. surprisingly, given that exon  <dig> is also alternatively spliced in utrophin <cit> , it appeared not to be in zebrafish.

alternative splicing of dystrophin exon 78
alternatively spliced exon  <dig>  is a vertebrate-specific innovation. in its absence , a highly conserved open reading frame, normally in the 3'utr of exon  <dig>  is brought into frame, conferring an amphipathic alpha-helical c-terminus homologous to the constitutive c-terminus of most invertebrate dystrophins <cit> . exon  <dig> itself is poorly conserved, and in bony fish even contains an in-frame stop codon . we tested whether the temporally regulated alternative splicing of exon  <dig> is conserved across vertebrates by performing semi-quantitative rt-pcr  of whole animal rna from different developmental stages of zebrafish. this showed a peak of exon  <dig> omission  in 24-hour embryos with > 90% inclusion in earlier and later samples . this temporal pattern shows a striking resemblance to that described by bies et al <cit> , whereby exon  <dig> is predominantly excluded in 14-day mouse embryos and predominantly included in adult mice . in order to establish potential determinants of such alternative splicing, we obtained publicly available sequences of the introns surrounding exon  <dig>  and also used whole genome vectorette pcr to acquire the equivalent sequence from the  cartilaginous fish, s. canicula . comparison of these sequences shows little significant conservation save in the environs of the exon  <dig> donor splice site, where a conserved motif  surrounds an atypical consensus sequence .

alternative splicing of α-dystrobrevin exons 9–13
studies in human and mouse have found consistent tissue-specific alternative splicing of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of α-dystrobrevin  <cit> , a phenomenon which has been shown to afford a facility for regulating the stoichiometry of syntrophins <cit> , as there are syntrophin-binding sites in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> . we found by rt-pcr between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of α-dystrobrevin from whole animal zebrafish rna that exon  <dig> was present in all products obtained, the tiny 9-bp exon  <dig> was present in most, but that exon  <dig> was missing from the vast majority of transcripts . this pattern seemed not to vary significantly with developmental stage. this shows that, as with dystrophin, the ability to modulate syntrophin stoichiometry is conserved. as with dystrophin exon  <dig>  we observe that all available α-dystrobrevin  exon  <dig> genomic sequences have an unusual pyrimidine at the + <dig> position in the donor splice site . no alternative splicing of this region was seen in zebrafish β- or γ-dystrobrevin at any developmental stage.

the dystrophin dp <dig> promoter
dp <dig> is an isoform encoded by exons 30– <dig> of the mammalian dystrophin gene. it is expressed largely, but not exclusively, in the retina <cit> , and its disruption is associated with electroretinopathy in dmd patients <cit> . the dp <dig> promoter lies just upstream of exon  <dig> of the human dystrophin gene, and we find that the n-terminal sequence which the corresponding first exon contributes to the dp <dig> isoform is highly conserved down to amphibia , as is the adjacent genomic sequence and the size of the isoform-specific intron . the sequence is not conserved in fish, and indeed zebrafish intron  <dig> is only  <dig> bp long. thus the canonical dp <dig> isoform <cit>  seems to be specific to tetrapods and absent from fish. this is at odds with the extremely strong 260-kda band observed by bolaños-jiménez et al <cit>  , which may therefore arise through a distinct but convergent mechanism. we confirmed the existence of an amphibian dp <dig> transcript, predicted from the xenopus tropicalis genome sequence, by rt-pcr from x. laevis rna .

the dystrophin dp <dig> promoter
dp <dig> is a dystrophin isoform expressed throughout the cns <cit> . the dp <dig> promoter lies between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the human dystrophin gene, and although the corresponding first exon splices onto exon  <dig>  the first in-frame initiation codon is not until exon  <dig> . we found that the human, dog, mouse, chick and frog dystrophin genes fulfil the following criteria: a) the first methionine of dp <dig> , together with its adjacent amino acid sequence in exon  <dig>  is conserved, b) there are no in-frame aug codons between the start of exon  <dig> and this methionine, and c) a ~2-kb region of intron  <dig>  including the first exon of the dp <dig> transcript, is conserved. by contrast, the zebrafish dystrophin gene a) has no such methionine codon in exon  <dig> , b) there are multiple in-frame methionines in exons 45– <dig>  and c) not only does intron  <dig> lack the conserved region, but it is only  <dig> bp long. thus, based on sequence homology alone, it seems that the dp <dig> isoform is likely to be conserved down to amphibia, but not fish . we confirmed the existence of an amphibian dp <dig> transcript, predicted from the x. tropicalis genome sequence, by rt-pcr from x. laevis rna .

the dystrophin dp <dig> promoter
dp <dig> is a dystrophin isoform expressed largely in the pns and cns  <cit> . the dp <dig> promoter lies between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the human dystrophin gene, and we find that the n-terminal sequence encoded by the first exon is conserved from mammals down to zebrafish, although different initiation codons may be used in the different species . dp <dig> transcripts are poorly represented in dbest, perhaps because pns as a tissue is underrepresented. we confirmed the existence of a fish dp <dig> transcript by rt-pcr from d. rerio whole animal rna . we note the unconfirmed stop codon in the chicken genomic sequence of dp <dig> exon  <dig> 

the dystrophin dp <dig> promoter
dp <dig> is expressed at high levels in many tissues  <cit> . the dp <dig> promoter lies between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the human dystrophin gene , and the n-terminal sequence which the corresponding first exon contributes to the dp <dig> isoform is conserved from mammals down to cartilaginous fish . the dp <dig> transcript from many species is well represented in dbest, and has been described in mammals <cit>  and zebrafish <cit> . other than noting a single est extending the conservation to cartilaginous fish , we include it here merely for completeness.

the g-utrophin promoter
g-utrophin is a short isoform analogous in structure to dp <dig> and drp <dig>  expressed in the brain and sensory ganglia <cit> . although there are very few transcribed g-utrophin sequences in the databases, the first exon  is exceptionally well conserved across vertebrate genomes. we confirmed the existence of a fish g-utrophin transcript by rt-pcr from d. rerio whole animal rna . there is sufficient residual sequence similarity  between this first exon and that of the dp <dig> transcript to suggest that they derive from duplication of a single ancestral first-exon sequence . we further note the existence in the zebrafish genome  of a g-utrophin pseudogene which comprises counterparts of almost all exons from g-utrophin exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  although many of these exons have aberrant splice sites and have incurred many missense mutations, it is still actively transcribed; there is an est  which contains exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and we were able to amplify a frameshifted cdna containing exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

streamlining in ascidians
genome sequence is available for the ascidians  ciona intestinalis and c. savignyi; in addition we have previously obtained a partial dystrophin-like sequence from c. intestinalis by degenerate rt-pcr <cit> . examination of the urochordate genomes enables a fuller assessment of their complement of dystrophin complex components. the dystrophin sequence is encoded by a single exon in each species, and is highly idiosyncratic . the length is a mere  <dig> residues in c. intestinalis and  <dig> in c. savignyi, these being ~75% identical to each other. these proteins have only two spectrin repeats , followed by the dystrophin-like series of ww, ef and zz domains; in this respect they grossly resemble vertebrate dp <dig> or drp <dig> . however, c-terminal to the zz domain the sequence becomes extremely degenerate, with few recognisable similarities to the vertebrate dystrophins. this is surprising for members of phylum chordata, given the obvious strong homology in this region between vertebrate dystrophins and dystrophins from other phyla .

both ciona species have a second dystrophin-related molecule of a similar size and domain to dystrobrevins and dystrotelins  between species, and on phylogenetic analysis shows a strong tendency to cluster with vertebrate dystrotelins . another ascidian, molgula tectiformis, has a related, albeit shorter, sequence  which also clusters with the dystrotelins.

in line with the degenerate c-terminus of their dystrophin molecules, there is no evidence for dystrobrevin- or syntrophin-related sequences in either ascidian genome, despite their clear detectability in much more distantly related genomes. there also seemed not to be any sarcoglycan-related sequences, though these are much harder to detect at such evolutionary distances. of the core dystrophin complex, therefore, only a severely n-terminally truncated and c-terminally degenerate dystrophin, a dystroglycan, and a dystrotelin-like molecule were detectable. it seems likely that as part of its derived biological streamlining <cit> , the ascidian has dispensed with much of its dystrophin complex. incidentally, the c. intestinalis dystrophin and dystrotelin sequences were identified as "zinc-finger genes" by miwata et al. , and subjected to expression analysis by in situ hybridization on developing embryos <cit> . unfortunately neither gene yielded distinct patterns at any developmental stage.

the dystrotelin family
during this study, we noted the existence in most vertebrate genomes of exons potentially encoding a novel, extremely divergent member of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin family. we name this dystrotelin, after its apparent evolutionary distance from the other members of the family . there were very few ests corresponding to any dystrotelin from any species, and none that are appropriately spliced. in order to confirm the expression and correct splicing of this gene, we concentrated our efforts on human, mouse and zebrafish, and were readily able to amplify full-length dystrotelin cdna from brain mrna of these three species. we present an alignment of known and predicted dystrotelin sequences .

the mouse gene is the best characterised, and will be described in the most detail here. it comprises  <dig> exons, the first of which is non-coding. the remaining  <dig> exons encode a protein of  <dig> amino acids and calculated molecular weight of  <dig> kda . the mouse dystrotelin gene maps to chromosome  <dig>  band c <dig>  although transcripts could be amplified from a broad range of tissues, exon  <dig> appears to be excluded from the majority of transcripts in tissues other than the brain, giving rise to a frameshifted transcript. semi-quantitative rt-pcr of in-frame transcripts containing exon  <dig>  from adult mouse rna samples confirmed this stronger expression in nervous and muscular tissues . in situ hybridization of part of the dystrotelin transcript to e <dig>  mouse embryos showed that embryonic dystrotelin is largely expressed in the brain and neural tube 

the human gene has a very similar structure, except that two of the exons, despite being recognisably conserved, have poor or absent splice sites ; accordingly we find these to be absent from amplified human cdna , resulting in an in-frame loss of  <dig> codons. these apparent splice site defects are also present in chimp and rhesus monkey, where we anticipate the splicing behaviour to be similar. the resulting interstitial deletion may have little functional impact on the protein, however, as exon  <dig> is very poorly conserved and exon  <dig> is very small. the primate dystrotelin genes have also suffered insertion of a dscr <dig> pseudogene in intron  <dig>  the ~70-kb human dystrotelin gene maps to 2q <dig> , just distal to the adam <dig> gene .

the zebrafish gene has an identical structure to its mammalian counterparts. the entire coding region  is readily amplifiable from whole-animal cdna of all developmental stages.

the dystrotelin protein shows significant similarity to dystrophin  and dystrobrevin  over the first  <dig> amino acids, corresponding roughly to the ef hands and zz domain. as there is 32% identity, 53% similarity between dystrophin and dystrobrevin over the same region, the three families of proteins appear to be equally related to each other . this level of similarity is such that the n-terminal region of dystrotelin is expected to form a compact globular tertiary structure grossly indistinguishable from that of the corresponding region of dystrophin <cit> . residues involved directly in dystrophin's interaction with β-dystroglycan <cit>  , however, are not conserved, making it unlikely that dystrotelin interacts with this ligand.

the c-terminal domain of the dystrotelins  is extremely divergent, to the extent that virtually no residual similarity is detectable between the mammalian and fish dystrotelin c-terminal domains, even using a dotplot with lax parameters. despite this, the exon structure  is absolutely conserved, strongly supporting identity-by-descent, and coils predicts that coiled-coil structures are favoured in analogous regions of mammalian and fish dystrotelins . because of the rapid rate of divergence of the dystrotelins, it is not possible to say whether the c-terminal domain was derived from the c-terminus of the dystrophin-like ancestor; there is no residual statistically significant similarity. however, a region predicted to form coiled-coils  contains a motif with striking resemblance to the second coiled-coil region of dystrophins and particularly dystrobrevins , which suggests identity-by-descent or convergent evolution. secondary structure prediction by psipred <cit>  yields surprisingly coherent structures for mammalian and fish dystrotelin c-termini despite the low sequence similarity .

the c-terminal coiled-coil-forming regions of dystrophins and dystrobrevins have been shown to associate with each other <cit> , an association which we have replicated using the yeast two-hybrid  technique . to test whether the c-terminal region  of mouse dystrotelin could associate with either of these proteins, we cloned it into the y2h dna-binding domain vector pbha and co-transformed it into l <dig> yeast with an activation domain construct  encoding the c-terminal domains of mouse dystrophin, mouse α-dystrobrevin or mouse dystrotelin. none of these three combinations resulted in activation of reporter genes, unlike the co-transformation of dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin, which gave strong activation of reporter genes, reflecting the well-known interaction <cit> . we conclude that, at least under the conditions of our y2h assay, dystrotelin is unable to heterodimerise with members of the dystrophin or dystrobrevin families, or to homodimerise.

in order to assess the likely subcellular localisation of dystrotelin, we cloned the entire mouse dystrotelin coding sequence n-terminal to the egfp coding region of pegfp-n <dig>  and transfected it transiently into cos- <dig> cells. egfp fluorescence was then examined using confocal fluorescent microscopy; this showed most of the dystrotelin-egfp fusion protein to be localised to the cytoplasmic membrane and to perinuclear structures . the latter showed substantial overlap with endoplasmic reticulum  staining, but not with mitochondrial staining . collection of a z-stack of confocal images  showed this pattern to apply throughout the vertical depth of the cells. localisation to the er is a common observation during heterologous overexpression in eukaryotic cells, and may be artefactual. egfp expressed from the vector alone showed almost entirely nuclear localisation . we conclude that heterologously expressed dystrotelin localises spontaneously to the cytoplasmic membrane, and possibly to the er.

it is clear that dystrotelin is evolving rapidly compared with other members of the dystrophin family. ka/ks, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations, can act as a measure of the direction and strength of selective pressure acting on a dna sequence via its ability to encode a protein. we compared the ka/ks for vertebrate members of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin/dystrotelin family . this gave ka/ks <  <dig>  within the vertebrate clade and ka/ks <  <dig>  between mammals for dystrophin, utrophin, drp <dig>  α-dystrobrevin and β-dystrobrevin, indicative of strong purifying  selection . in contrast, the overall ka/ks for the full-length dystrotelin coding region was  <dig> – <dig> , an unusually high figure for a protein-coding gene. knowing that the second half of the protein  is more variable than the first half, we divided the open reading frame accordingly and reassessed the ka/ks. while the first half gives a lower ka/ks of  <dig> , the second half gave a ka/ks of approximately unity; this is usually taken to indicate a lack of selective pressure or a mosaic of positive and negative selection. because there are manifestly a number of residues within the c-terminal domain which show strong conservation, we favour the explanation that other residues are conversely under positive selective pressure to change. such pressure is often associated with gene products involved in the immune, reproductive and cognitive systems <cit> .

it is puzzling that whereas human and rhesus monkey  have complete dystrotelin open reading frames, the ensembl sequence for chimp  shows the presence of nonsense mutations in three consecutive exons. the surrounding exonic and intronic sequences are otherwise virtually identical to human. we set out to check whether this was perhaps due to poor local sequence quality in the ensembl sequence by performing genomic pcr on our own chimp and gibbon  dna samples; this confirmed all three nonsense mutations in the chimp , but showed that the gibbon , like human and rhesus monkey, has an intact open reading frame. it therefore appears that, bizarrely, three separate nonsense mutations have become fixed in the chimp dystrotelin gene during the last  <dig> million years. this shows that dystrotelin function is dispensible for at least one vertebrate.

the origin of the dystrotelin sequence is unclear. we attempted to establish this by using the n-terminal region  to perform a phylogenetic analysis against our most diverse sequences. all tree methods used gave the same, well-supported result, namely that all dystrophins  cluster together, as do all dystrobrevins, to the exclusion of the dystrotelin clade. as exon boundaries are slow to change during evolution, we compared the positions of exon boundaries between the alignable region of dystrophins, dystrobrevins and dystrotelins . by this reckoning, dystrophin shares one character uniquely with dystrotelin  and one with dystrobrevin , while dystrotelin and dystrobrevin share the absence of a ww domain. this approach therefore fails to resolve the trichotomy.

the implication of this is that the divergence of dystrotelin pre-dates the divergence of schistosomes from other metazoa, and possibly even pre-dates the ancestral duplication that gave rise to the separate dystrophin and dystrobrevin families. if this is so, then dystrotelins should be detectable in invertebrates. we could find no other dystrophin/dystrobrevin paralogues in the nematode or schistosome genomes, but three ascidians have a paralogue which shows some affinity to the vertebrate dystrotelins . in addition, three insects  have genes encoding dah , which shows a similar range of attributes to the vertebrate dystrotelins and the urochordate paralogues. dystrotelins and dah share the following properties: a) a reasonably well-conserved n-terminal series of domains shared with the dystrophins and dystrobrevins , b) a high rate of sequence divergence , c) a very poorly constrained c-terminus with the propensity to form two coiled-coil structures, d) a fairly tight size-range of 640– <dig> amino acids, e) deep phylogenetic branching outside all known metazoan dystrophins and dystrobrevins . in summary, given the rapid sequence divergence in these proteins, it is conceivable that dystrotelins and dah are orthologues, but rather hard to prove.

discussion
we present here a comprehensive description of dystrophin- and dystrobrevin-related sequences from available metazoan genome sequences, validated in representative organisms by rt-pcr, or acquired de novo by us. the work establishes the breadth of sequence diversity and identifies two novel vertebrate family members . the implications are many.

the alternative splicing that has previously been reported in mammalian dystrophin and α-dystrobrevin serves to determine the presence or absence of the syntrophin binding regions and of the ancestral c-terminus. however it has been unclear whether this is an arcane mammalian feature or a more widespread phenomenon; indeed many alternative splicing events barely seem to be conserved between mammals  <cit> . here we show that the temporally regulated alternative splicing of dystrophin exons  <dig> and  <dig> is conserved in zebrafish, as is alternative splicing of α-dystrobrevin exons  <dig> and   <dig>  these suggest that the need to modulate both syntrophin stoichiometry and the presence of the ancestral dystrophin c-terminus are vertebrate-wide, necessitating mechanisms that have been conserved for over  <dig> million years. a potential basis for the conserved splicing behaviour is noted in a sub-optimal splice donor site at all vertebrate dystrophin exon  <dig> and α-dystrobrevin exon  <dig> sequences ; in each case these splice sites have a pyrimidine at base + <dig>  normally seen in < 4% of vertebrate donor sites <cit> . furthermore, pyrimidine + <dig> was also seen adjacent to all β-dystrobrevin exon  <dig> sequences, which are also alternatively spliced <cit> , but not γ-dystrobrevin exon  <dig>  which is not alternatively spliced . this suggests that either specific mechanisms recognise this unusual splice site in conditions when that exon is to be included or, as has been hypothesised, that alternatively spliced exons tend to have sub-optimal splice sites so that they become more dependent on the binding of exonic splice enhancers by conditionally expressed sr proteins.

similarly, the ability of the vertebrate dystrophin and utrophin genes to generate n-terminally truncated isoforms by the use of internal promoters has only been studied in mammals . in the case of dp <dig>  dp <dig>  and g-utrophin, relatively few studies have been performed, and it was until now entirely conceivable that mammal-specific cryptic promoters are responsible for generating transcripts of incidental significance. we find that on the contrary, dp <dig> and g-utrophin promoters are as broadly conserved as the dp <dig> promoter, with striking levels of conservation throughout vertebrates at the amino acid and nucleotide level. the similarity between dp <dig>  g-utrophin and drp <dig> suggests that there has been a promoter in this intron since before the serial gene duplications which gave rise to the paralogues; indeed the somewhat smaller sea urchin dystrophin isoform sudp <dig> arises within the orthologous intron  <cit> , as does the rather larger drosophila melanogaster dystrophin isoform dp <dig> <cit> , suggesting that the promoter is ancient. the situation regarding the dystrophin dp <dig> and dp <dig> promoters is slightly different; although we here show by their existence in frog that they are probably conserved throughout tetrapods, they are clearly absent in the three available fish genomes, where the corresponding introns, large in tetrapods, are tiny. this tallies with the observation of neuman et al. that intragenic promoters in the dystrophin gene correlate with large introns <cit> . it is possible that the dp <dig> and dp <dig> promoters are more ancient but have been lost in teleosts, which are in many respects highly derived organisms; examining cartilaginous fish might resolve this. it is interesting that wherever the alternative first exon encodes protein, the sequence of the latter is highly conserved , implying specific functional importance rather than merely a means of making a truncated protein.

our studies of drp <dig> show that the unique n-terminus is specific to tetrapod drp <dig> molecules. this n-terminus is encoded by the first coding exon  and the first three-quarters of exon  <dig>  in both bony and cartilaginous fish, translation seems to initiate at a methionine  near the end of exon  <dig>  in the case of bony fish, there is a conserved orf upstream of this point, but the preceding exon has an in-frame stop codon; it is therefore formally possible that a different isoform, using a different upstream exon, might give rise to a longer protein than the one we present here. in cartilaginous fish, on the other hand, there is a stop codon a mere five codons upstream of this methionine, so no longer protein can be produced.

despite the absence of the n-terminal sequence in non-tetrapod drp2s, we note a weak similarity between the n-termini of drp2s, dp <dig> and g-utrophin, including the presence of several conserved cysteine residues and other short motifs. whereas the n-termini of dp <dig> and g-utrophin are almost certainly descended from a single ancestral sequence , it is conceivable that the similarities with the tetrapod drp <dig> n-terminus have arisen by convergent, rather than divergent, evolution. the apparent conserved cysteines  suggest to us the possibility of post-translational modification at the n-terminus of all of these proteins, though there are no recognised consensus motifs for such modification.

cyclostomes, which occupy a taxonomic position intermediate between protochordates and gnathostomes, also show an intermediate elaboration of the dystrophin family, with a single dystrophin/utrophin-like molecule. the point of divergence of this sequence  strongly suggests that the last common ancestor of cyclostomes and gnathostomes would also have had a drp <dig> protein, but we were unable to identify this in the cyclostome descendents, indicating that it may have been lost secondarily. it may be that a dp116/g-utrophin isoform generated from the single dystrophin/utrophin gene has assumed the role of drp <dig> 

the pared-down dgc component repertoire of the ascidians is rather surprising, given their widespread conservation across the invertebrate phyla. we detected only dystrophin, dystroglycan and dystrotelin in the two almost complete ascidian genome sequences. although we cannot rule out the existence of rather divergent sarcoglycan sequences, we are confident that the ascidians, members of phylum chordata, lack both dystrobrevin and the syntrophins . in line with this observation, the binding sites for these proteins on the ascidian dystrophin molecule are highly degenerate, even compared with those from distant phyla. furthermore, the dystrophin is n-terminally truncated, being slightly smaller than vertebrate dp <dig>  this is consistent with hypotheses and observations regarding the "streamlining" of ascidian biology  <cit> , and also demonstrates that loss of some core components of the dgc can be compatible with metazoan life.

the discovery of the novel molecule γ-dystrobrevin is remarkable in several ways. first, its sequence reproducibly diverges before the divergence of fish and tetrapods in both the α- and β-dystrobrevin lineages . the clear inference from this is that the last common ancestor of fish and tetrapods must have had three dystrobrevin paralogues, with our ancestors losing the γ-dystrobrevin gene at a later date. second, in fish, the β-dystrobrevin gene has lost several exons in the central syntrophin-binding region, which the γ-dystrobrevin gene has retained . third, there are, apart from these missing exons, no obvious differences between the β- and γ-dystrobrevins; perhaps the salient differences are in their patterns of expression. an intriguing possibility is that rather than regulate syntrophin stoichiometry by alternative splicing of β-dystrobrevin exon  <dig> , fish could achieve essentially the same end by alternative expression of β- and γ-dystrobrevin. our preliminary analysis of the expression of this fish-specific dystrobrevin in d. rerio shows that its mrna localises predominantly to the vertical myosepta, structures which have been the prime focus for the study of the dystrophin complex in fish  <cit> . full-length dystrophin, dystroglycan, and several sarcoglycans have been shown to localise to the myosepta  <cit> , as has dystrophin mrna <cit> , although the mechanism and significance of the latter is not understood. it has been assumed that the vertical myosepta are homologues of tetrapod myomuscular and/or myotendinous junctions. our finding of a specific gene encoding a myoseptal dystrobrevin may aid targeted manipulation of the dystrophin complex in muscle cells.

dystrotelin was an unanticipated discovery, given the high level of scrutiny of the vertebrate genome sequences. it is likely to have evaded description because the similarity of individual exon sequences to dystrophin is barely significant and it is poorly represented in est databases. there are several features of dystrotelin which prompt immediate interest. first, the existence of a novel distant relative of dystrophin and dystrobrevin, sharing common core structures of these proteins yet differing from them as much as they differ from each other , obviously presents a novel opportunity for understanding the core function of the superfamily. second, while dystrophin and dystrobrevin have been highly conserved throughout metazoan evolution, the more rapidly diverging sequence of dystrotelin bears testament to a very different level of functional constraint. a possible explanation for this lower conservation is that while dystrophin and dystrobrevin form the core of an intricate multiprotein complex, dystrotelin may act alone or in partnership with a smaller number of proteins. ongoing interaction studies may help resolve this issue. it is particularly striking that despite broad conservation throughout phylum chordata , the chimpanzee appears not to have an intact dystrotelin gene. third, it seems probable  that dystrotelin is the vertebrate orthologue of dah, a protein with an intriguing null phenotype in drosophila. dah is involved in the synchronised cellularisation of thousands of nuclei in the syncytial early fly embryo ; in its absence, the invaginating cleavage furrows which ultimately enfold the nuclei are severely disrupted, and development stalls <cit> . dah has been shown to be tightly membrane-associated and highly phosphorylated in a temporally regulated manner <cit> , and seems to be associated with vesicles which convene at the extending cleavage furrow <cit> . its localisation depends on nuf  <cit> , the fly orthologue of vertebrate pericentrosomal and cleavage furrow proteins rab11-fip <dig> and rab11-fip <dig>  a vertebrate counterpart of the drosophila cellularisation process is not obvious, although dystrotelin may be involved in other forms of cytokinesis. there is also the possibility that dah has another function which is masked by the severity and early onset of the cellularisation defect. we surveyed the literature for candidate human diseases which might be associated defects in the dystrotelin gene; its position in chromosomal band 2q <dig>  means that it is heterozygously deleted in several patients with complex but subtle phenotypes  <cit> , and disorders such as early-onset osteoarthritis <cit>  and spastic ataxia <cit>  have recently been linked to markers nearby.

CONCLUSIONS
by way of a summary, we can now sketch a broader picture of the evolution of the dystrophin/dystrobrevin/dystrotelin superfamily .

a. the three branches of the superfamily  originate from a single ancestral gene which had all the signature structural elements still borne by most representatives. we believe that it probably resembled β-dystrobrevins in gross structure. we are not able to resolve this trichotomy by phylogenetic means.

b. the dystrophin branch acquired a large n-terminal extension comprising ch domains, spectrin repeats and a ww domain. although we cannot prove that this is an acquired trait through gene fusion, this explanation is more parsimonious than domain loss in the dystrobrevin and dystrotelin branches. smart architecture analysis <cit>  reveals no extant proteins with this domain architecture from which we might speculate on the nature of the source of this material.

c. the affinity of the dah family is uncertain, hence its emergence from a trichotomy on the tree. however we have advanced a number of circumstantial arguments that it is the orthologue of the dystrotelins, and that this affinity has been masked by the rapid rate of sequence change in this clade.

d. the invertebrate repertoire of single dystrophin, dystrobrevin and dystrotelin genes seems almost universal, except for ascidians.

e. the streamlined genome of the ascidians  lost several core components of the dgc, including dystrobrevin and both syntrophins; it retains dystroglycan, dystrophin and dystrotelin.

f. the dp <dig> region of the single invertebrate dystrophin gene underwent a duplication in an ancestor of all craniates to give rise to drp <dig> and a common ancestor of dystrophin and utrophin.

g. at a similar time, the invertebrate dystrobrevin gene underwent a tandem duplication of exon  <dig> to give the vertebrate-specific exon  <dig>  and the entire gene was duplicated to give rise to γ-dystrobrevin and a common ancestor of α- and β-dystrobrevin.

h. the dystrophin/utrophin gene in an ancestor of all gnathostomes acquired exon  <dig> then underwent a whole-gene duplication to give rise to separate dystrophin and utrophin genes, including paralogous short isoforms dp <dig> and g-utrophin. the dystrophin gene acquired exon  <dig> which allows it to conditionally remove the c-terminus of the protein.

i. drp <dig> and the c-terminus of dystrophin/utrophin were lost in an ancestor of extant cyclostomes.

j. the α/β-dystrobrevin gene underwent a whole-gene duplication in an ancestor of all gnathostomes to give rise to separate α- and β-dystrobrevin genes. the α-dystrobrevin gene gained exons  <dig> and  <dig> and those encoding the novel c-terminus, while the β-dystrobrevin gene of fish lost exons  <dig> and  <dig> 

k. an ancestor of all tetrapods gained novel intragenic promoters for the dp <dig> and dp <dig> isoforms in the dystrophin gene, and lost the γ-dystrobrevin gene.

l. point mutations resulted in the functional loss of exons  <dig> and  <dig> in primate dystrotelin genes and disrupted the orf in chimpanzee.

basal vertebrates therefore have a repertoire of seven superfamily members , with one of these being lost in tetrapods. most invertebrates studied have three members, one from each branch. the basic shared function which is implied by the common architecture of these distantly related proteins remains unclear, but it is our hope that this broadening of the scope of dystrophin biology will afford ever more avenues of investigation to bear on its elucidation.
