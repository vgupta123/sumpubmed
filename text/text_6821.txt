BACKGROUND
perplexing relationships among diseases often go unexplained. how, for example, does obesity contribute to cancer risk? why are patients with certain neurological diseases, like parkinson’s, at lower risk for many cancers? understanding the genetic and environmental factors responsible for these striking risk-specific relationships among diseases may reveal novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease development and lead to better disease prevention and treatment. it has been increasingly recognized that phenotypically-related diseases often reflect overlapping molecular causation  <cit> . recently, disease phenotypic similarity has become another major data source exploited by computational methods in discovering novel candidate disease genes  <cit> . the advantage of this phenotype-driven approach over traditional approaches is that we can hypothesize that similar phenotypes in two diseases may result from genes/pathways that are involved in the same biological processes. for phenotype-driven candidate gene selection, a two-layered heterogeneous data network is often constructed where the phenotypic network layer consists of connections between similar diseases, while the genetic network layer contains molecular data such as protein-protein interaction , pathways, gene co-expression, or shared protein domain. these two network layers are then linked through known disease-gene associations  <cit> . currently, disease phenotype networks are mainly constructed based on disease co-morbidity  <cit>  or text mining of the online mendelian inheritance in man  database  <cit> . for systems approaches to studying phenotypic relationships among diseases, disease-disease phenotypic associations  from multiple heterogeneous sources  are necessary to mitigate the incompleteness and biases inherent to many biomedical networks  <cit> . in this study, we focus on building a disease-risk relationship knowledge base by automatically extracting disease-disease risk pairs from medline.

currently, more than  <dig> million biomedical records are available on medline, making it an excellent source of disease-risk knowledge. for example, searching pubmed for the phrase “is a risk factor for” returns a total of  <dig>  sentences, among which more than  <dig>  sentences are related to cardiovascular disease risks, and another  <dig>  are related to diabetes risks. by the same token, the single sentence “obesity is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, and hyperinsulinemia, a common condition in obese patients, may underlie this relationship”  contains the observed risk relationship among three diseases: obesity, colorectal cancer and hyperinsulinemia. despite the rich disease risk-specific semantic relationship knowledge contained in this corpus of published biomedical literature, the fact that the knowledge is buried in free text with limited machine understandability poses a significant barrier.

automatic extraction of biomedical relationships from medline is a highly active area of research. common approaches for biomedical relation extraction use rule-based, co-occurrence-based statistical approaches or natural language processing  approaches. these have most often been applied to extract relationships between drugs, diseases, proteins, and genes  <cit> . research efforts in disease-risk relationship extraction tasks, however, have been quite limited. recently, liu et al. manually identified environmental etiological factors associated with  <dig>  diseases by searching the mesh annotations of medline articles  <cit> . fiszman et al. extracted risk factors for metabolic syndrome from medical literature by using the mesh heading “risk factors” to retrieve risk-specific sentences  <cit> . while liu’s study is based on manual curation, fiszman’s study falls more under the supervised machine learning approach category since it relies on the semantic relationships available in the unified medical language system  semantic network and only focuses on one type of disease: metabolic syndrome. in addition, studies have shown that using manually assigned mesh terms, as in both the above-mentioned studies, results in limited recall in categorizing biomedical articles  <cit> . currently, no risk-specific disease-disease semantic relationship knowledge base exists that can be leveraged upon in developing computational approaches to both disease gene discovery and drug development.

approach
automatically extracting disease-risk relationships from free text is a challenging task. risk factors for diseases are often complicated and highly heterogeneous, including genes , predisposing diseases , chemicals , life styles and behavior , family history, ethnicity, age, and gender, among many other factors. no specific lexicon of disease-associated risk factors exists, yet such an entity is required by most information extraction systems for relationship extraction. even our current task of extracting risk-specific relationships among diseases is difficult. in general, extracting specific semantic relationships among the same type of entities, such as disease-co-morbidity, disease-manifestation, and disease-disease risk pairs, is more challenging than extracting relationships between two different types of entities, such as drug-disease, drug-gene and drug-side effects.

recent studies in semi-supervised pattern learning approaches are motivated by the use of a very large collection of texts   <cit> . since semi-supervised approaches have the advantage of requiring minimal human annotation of data, they are able to extract broad types of relationships from free text. semi-supervised learning approaches have been used in non-biomedical domains to extract information from the web  <cit> . however, the potential use of semi-supervised approaches to build large-scale biomedical databases that enable systems approaches to disease gene discovery and drug repositioning has not been fully explored.

recently, we developed a series of semi-supervised pattern learning approaches for named entity recognition  <cit> , relationship extraction  <cit> , and medical image retrieval from the web  <cit> . semi-supervised learning approaches depend on the regularity of language and the redundancy of data. a big corpus such as medline is ideal for such tasks. in our current study, we develop an efficient and effective semi-supervised pattern-learning algorithm to extract disease-disease risk relationships from medline. since our ultimate research goal is to develop systems approaches that exploit disease-phenotype relationships for subsequent network-based candidate gene prediction and drug repositioning, the precision and scalability of the relationship extraction algorithms is critical. pattern-based relationship extraction approaches have the advantage of being highly precise and efficient. in addition, since our approach is semi-supervised, it has the advantage of requiring minimal human intervention and no external domain knowledge.

methods
build a local medline search engine
we downloaded a total of  <dig> , <dig> medline citations  published between  <dig> and  <dig> from the u.s. national library of medicine . each sentence was syntactically parsed with stanford parser  <cit>  using the amazon cloud computing service . we used the publicly available information retrieval library lucene  to create a local medline search engine with indices created on both sentences and their corresponding parse trees.

build a clean disease lexicon
a highly accurate and comprehensive disease lexicon is critical for the task of building a high quality disease-phenotype relationship knowledge base, including our current task of building driskkb. we recently built a large clean disease lexicon by combining and manually cleaning all disease terms from umls with the following semantic types: “disease disease or syndrome”, “sign or symptom”, “neoplastic process”, “congenital abnormality”, “mental or behavioral dysfunction” and “anatomical abnormality”, and from the human disease ontology . we used this clean disease lexicon in our recent study of extracting disease-manifestation  <cit>  and drug-disease pairs  <cit>  from medline. the clean disease lexicon consists of a total of  <dig>  disease terms  that appear in medline. the cleaned disease lexicon was manually curated by curators from thintek.com and can be obtained for free academic use by contacting co-author qwang@thintek.com.

semi-supervised disease-disease risk relationship extraction
the semi-supervised relationship extraction algorithm is depicted in figure  <dig> and can be formulated as follows: given:  a seed pattern such as “d <dig> due to d2” where both d <dig> and d <dig> are disease terms from the input disease lexicon;  a text corpus of medline sentences and their corresponding parse trees;  a disease lexicon. do: starting from the seed pattern, which represents a typical expression of a disease-disease risk relationship, iteratively discover new patterns and extract new pairs with newly discovered patterns. when no significant number of new patterns is discovered, rank extracted patterns and pairs.

pair extraction
seed pattern or patterns extracted from previous iterations were used as search queries to the local medline search engine. both sentences and parse trees that contained these patterns were retrieved. we extracted disease-disease pairs from the retrieved sentences if the disease pairs and the pattern followed the restriction: “d <dig> pattern d <dig> ” wherein both d <dig> and d <dig> are disease terms as well as noun phrases in the retrieved sentences. the requirement that both diseases be noun phrases in the sentences was formulated to avoid false positives. for example, without this restriction, the incorrect  d <dig> →d <dig> pair “infection →hypertension” would be extracted from the following sentence: “herpes simplex virus type  <dig> infection is a risk factor for hypertension” , since the disease term “infection” instead of the more specific term “herpes simplex virus type  <dig> infection” is included in the input disease lexicon. the correct d <dig> →d <dig> risk pair in above sentence is “herpes simplex virus type  <dig> infection →hypertension”, not “infection →hypertension.”

pattern extraction
disease pairs  extracted from the previous iteration were used as search queries to the local medline search engine. corresponding sentences and parse trees were retrieved. syntactic patterns between the disease pairs were extracted if d1-d <dig> pairs and their patterns conformed to the following format: “d <dig> pattern d <dig> ” wherein both diseases d <dig> and d <dig> were noun phrases in the retrieved sentences.

pattern ranking
the iterative pair extraction and pattern extraction processes ran until no significant number of new patterns was discovered . we then ranked extracted patterns. each pattern was ranked based on how similar its output  was to the output of the seed pattern. using the output of the seed pattern  as the gold standard, we developed three pattern-ranking algorithms:  precision-based ranking, wherein patterns were ranked based on pattern specificity;  recall-based ranking, wherein patterns were ranked based on pattern generality; and  f1-based pattern ranking, wherein both pattern specificity and generality were taken into account. we define ins to be the set of pairs matched by pattern p, and the intersection ins ∩ ins as the set of pairs matched by both pattern p and seed pattern p <dig>  the precision-based, recall-based, and f1-based ranking scores are defined as below:

  rsprecision=|ins∩ins||ins| 

  rsrecall=|ins∩ins||ins| 

  rsf1=2∗precision∗recallprecision+recall 

pair ranking
extracted pairs were ranked based on both the scores of their associated patterns and their frequency counts in medline. a reliable d <dig> →d <dig> pair is one that is associated with reliable patterns many times. the ranking score  of a pair or a relationship  is defined as follows:

  rs=∑i=0nlog)∗count 

rs is the score of its associated patterns , which is defined in , , or , and count  is the number of times that the pair is associated with the pattern in the entire medline corpus.

pattern selection, database construction and manual evaluation
from the top-ranked patterns , we manually selected a total of  <dig> disease risk-specific patterns that associated with at least  <dig> unique disease-disease risk pairs. these patterns had both high precisions and recalls as determined by how they ranked and by the manual examination. the manual examination of top-ranked patterns took about  <dig> minutes. we then extracted disease-disease risk pairs from medline associated with these patterns. these pairs were used in in building driskkb database.

using each of the  <dig> selected patterns and their associated disease-disease risk pairs as search queries to the local medline search engine, we retrieved sentences that contained these patterns and disease pairs in the format of “d <dig> pattern d <dig> ” from these retrieved sentences, we randomly selected  <dig> sentences for each pattern  for manual curation. two annotators independently curated these sentences. disease-disease risk pairs from these sentences were classified to one of three categories: correct, partially correct, and incorrect. precisions of patterns as well as of pairs were calculated using pairs that were identified as correct by both annotators; these functioned as the gold standard. the kappa statistics that measures the agreement between the two annotators  <cit>  was as high as  <dig> .

systematically analyze extracted disease-disease risk  pairs
analyze the correlation between disease-risk relationships and disease-associated genes
we analyzed shared the genetic components underlying the direct d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs. we also analyzed the shared genes for disease-disease  pairs with overlapping risk diseases  or d1-d <dig> pairs with overlapping effect diseases . we used two complementary sources of disease-gene association knowledge for this analysis. the first one was from the omim    <cit> , and consisted of  <dig>  pairs for  <dig>  diseases and  <dig>  genes. the second was from the nhgri’s  gwas catalog database   <cit>  and consisted of  <dig>  disease/trait-gene pairs for  <dig> diseases and  <dig>  genes. omim is a database that catalogues many mendelian diseases with known genetic components. the gwas catalog database is an online database of snp-trait associations derived from genome-wide association studies. many diseases from the gwas catalog are common complex diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. we first mapped disease terms between the extracted d <dig> →d <dig> pairs and the disease-gene pairs from omim and from the gwas catalog. we calculated the average number of shared genes between disease-disease pairs  and compared the number to all disease-disease pairs for mapped diseases. for disease-disease pairs that shared risk diseases or effect diseases at different cutoffs, we calculated the average number of shared genes at each cutoff.

analyze the correlation between disease-risk relationships and disease-associated drugs
similarly, we analyzed the shared drug treatments for direct d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs, for d1-d <dig> pairs with shared predisposing diseases, and for d1-d <dig> pairs with shared effect diseases. we extracted a total of  <dig>  disease-drug treatment pairs from clinicaltrials.gov , a registry of federally and privately supported clinical trials conducted in the united states and around the world , as the disease-drug association knowledge. these disease-drug pairs consisted of  <dig>  diseases and  <dig>  drugs. we mapped the disease terms between. these disease-drug pairs consisted of  <dig>  diseases and  <dig>  drugs. we mapped the disease terms between disease-drug pairs and disease-disease risk pairs. as in the above genetic correlation study, we calculated the average number of shared drugs between d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs and compared it to that of all disease-disease pairs. for disease-disease pairs that shared risk diseases or effect diseases at different cut-offs, we calculated the average number of shared drugs at each cutoff.

RESULTS
top ranked patterns contain many disease risk-specific patterns
using the typical disease risk-specific pattern “d <dig> due to d2” as a search query to the local medline search engine, we retrieved a total of  <dig>  sentences containing two diseases and the seed pattern in the format of “d <dig> due to d <dig> ” wherein both d <dig> and d <dig> were diseases and also noun phrases in the sentences. from these sentences, we extracted a total of  <dig>  unique d <dig> ←d <dig> pairs . we then used these extracted d <dig> ←d <dig> pairs as search queries to the local medline search engine to find their associated patterns . after two iterations, we stopped the process since not many additional risk-specific patterns with both high precision and high recall were discovered. we then ranked the extracted patterns  using the output associated with the seed pattern as the gold standard . the three pattern-ranking methods are precision-based, recall-based and f1-based. top  <dig> ranked patterns for each method are listed in table  <dig>  and in table  <dig> . the risk-specific patterns associated with at least  <dig> distinct disease-disease risk pairs are highlighted.

risk-specific patterns associated with ≥ <dig> pairs are highlighted.

risk-specific patterns associated with ≥ <dig> pairs are highlighted.

as shown table  <dig>  the precision-based method was able to rank disease-risk-specific patterns highly on the list. for example, all of the top  <dig> patterns as determined by the method precision-based are risk-specific patterns, including “d <dig> owing to d <dig> ” “d <dig> attributable to d <dig> ” and “d <dig> was caused by d <dig> ” however, the majority of these top-ranked patterns were associated with less than  <dig> disease pairs; the exception is the pattern “d <dig> resulting from d <dig> ” which was associated with  <dig>  pairs. on the other hand, top patterns ranked by the f1-based method included more risk-specific patterns with high recalls. for example, the second highest ranking pattern, “d <dig> caused by d <dig> ” was associated with a total of  <dig>  distinct d <dig> ←d <dig> pairs. the third highest ranking pattern, “d <dig> secondary to d <dig> ” was associated with  <dig>  distinct d <dig> ←d <dig> pairs. the recall-based method performed similarly to the f1-based ranking method in ranking many risk-specific patterns with high recalls highly.

using the same  <dig>  d <dig> ←d <dig> pairs associated with the seed pattern “d <dig> due to d2” as the gold standard, we also learned typical patterns that specify risk relationship in the reverse direction , such as “d <dig> causing d <dig> ” and “d <dig> as a cause of d <dig> ” as shown in table  <dig>  all top  <dig> patterns ranked by the precision-based method are disease risk-specific patterns such as “d <dig> is a leading cause of d2” and “d <dig> as a cause of d <dig> ” even though these top-ranked patterns are highly specific, they had limited recalls in that each of them was associated with less than  <dig> d <dig> →d <dig> pairs. both the f1-based and recall-based methods were able to rank risk-specific patterns with high recalls at the top. for example, two additional risk-specific patterns with high recalls appeared in the top  <dig> patterns ranked by the f1-based approach: “d <dig> causing d <dig> ”  and “d <dig> as a cause of d2” .

disease-disease risk pairs extracted using the selected patterns are of high precision
we manually examined a total of  <dig>   randomly selected sentences that contained patterns and their associated disease-disease risk pairs in the format “d <dig> pattern d <dig> ” a pattern is correct for a given sentence if the semantic relationship between its associated disease-disease pairs is disease-risk-specific. as shown in figure  <dig>  all the selected patterns were highly precise, with an average precision of  <dig> .

we then calculated the precisions of disease pairs associated with these patterns. the correctness of the pairs depends on not only their associated patterns but also the underlying disease lexicon and the parsing accuracy of stanford parser. from the  <dig>  sentences, we extracted a total of  <dig>  distinct mention-level disease-disease pairs, among which  <dig>  pairs were correct with a precision of  <dig>  and  <dig>  pairs were partially correct with a precision of  <dig> . the high precision of the extracted pairs reflects that the specificity of the selected patterns, the accuracy of the manually curated input disease lexicon, and the strategy of using parse trees to enforce the rule that disease terms be noun phrases in the sentences. the majority of partially incorrect extracted disease pairs was caused by the way we delineated the noun phrase boundary. for example, from the sentence “sebaceous carcinoma arising from bowen’s disease of the vulva” , the partial pair “sebaceous carcinoma-bowen’s disease” was extracted, rather than the more complete pair ‘sebaceous carcinoma-bowen’s disease of the vulva”. the disease term “bowen’s disease” not “bowen’s disease of the vulva” is included in the disease lexicon. in addition, “bowen’s disease” by itself is a noun phrase in the parse tree of the sentence:  )    ) )   ))))).

in our current study, we learned many patterns after two iterations; however, many of these patterns are similar such as “due to” and “was due to.” one of the limitations of our study is that we did not merge similar pattern since we did not have an automatic way to do this systematically. however, this limitation should not have affected our evaluation results. the majority of the  <dig> selected patterns are distinctive, such as “due to”, “caused by”, and “secondary to”. in addition, the results across these  <dig> patterns are very consistent.

pattern extraction and ranking algorithms are robust in terms of seed patterns
since the performance of many bootstrapping iterative pattern-learning systems may depend on the choice of initial seeds, an important question is whether these different starting points lead to different results. we investigated this issue by starting from five different seed patterns and examined whether the  <dig> selected risk-specific patterns that were selected from top-ranked patterns of the seed pattern “d <dig> due to d2” are also enriched in top ranked patterns when other seeds are used.

the five seed patterns include three typical risk-specific patterns with both high precisions and recalls:“d <dig> due to d2” , “d <dig> caused by d2” , and “d <dig> secondary to d2” , a risk-specific pattern with high precision but relatively low recall: “d <dig> attributable to d2” , and a non-risk-specific general pattern: “d <dig> and d2” . we ran the iterative pattern extraction and relationship extraction for two iterations using each of the five patterns as the seed. after two iterations, we ranked the extracted pattern using the f1-based pattern ranking method and counted how many of the  <dig> risk-specific patterns appeared among top-ranked pairs at  <dig> different ranking cutoffs . as shown in table  <dig>  the outputs  among three seed patterns with both high precisions and recalls  are similar. for example,  <dig> of the  <dig> risk-specific patterns appeared in the top  <dig> patterns for seed “d <dig> caused by d2”. top-ranked patterns for the relatively more specific risk-specific pattern  are also enriched with patterns from the  <dig> selected patterns, however, the enrichment is smaller compared to those for seed <dig>  seed <dig> and seed <dig>  as a negative control, we also used a non-risk-specific pattern “d <dig> and d2” as seed. the enrichment of disease-specific patterns among top ranked patterns for this non-risk-specific seed is much smaller compared to those of other four seeds. in summary, the pattern-ranking algorithm is robust in terms of seed choices as long as the seed is a risk-specific pattern with relatively high precision and recall  is used. we experimented in using more than one patterns as seeds, and found that the algorithm is not sensitive to the number of seed patterns used .

disease-disease risk pairs tend to share both genes and drugs
the f1-based ranking method prioritized many risk-specific patterns with both high precisions and high recalls on the top; however not all top-ranked patterns were necessarily disease-risk-specific patterns. we manually selected  <dig> risk-specific patterns with high recalls from the top-ranked patterns and then extracted disease-disease risk pairs from medline using these selected patterns. examples of these selected patterns are “d <dig> due to d <dig> ” “d <dig> caused by d <dig> ” “d <dig> secondary to d <dig> ” and “d <dig> resulting from d <dig> ” using these patterns, we extracted a total of  <dig>  unique disease-disease risk pairs , representing  <dig>  diseases. we then analyzed the relationships between these  <dig>  disease-disease risk pairs and disease-related genes and drugs .

as shown in table  <dig>  among extracted d <dig> →d <dig> pairs with mapped disease names between d <dig> →d <dig> pairs and disease-gene pairs,  <dig> % pairs shared genes as determined by disease-gene pairs from omim. the average number of shared genes was  <dig> , a significantly higher number than the average of  <dig>  for d1-d <dig> combination pairs . we observed a similar trend when the disease-gene associations from the gwas studies were used. among d <dig> →d <dig> pairs with mapped diseases,  <dig> % shared genes, a much higher percentage than the  <dig> % resulting when the disease-gene association data from omim was used. the average number of shared genes was  <dig> , a significantly higher number than the number of  <dig>  for d1-d <dig> combinations.

we also investigated whether d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs were treated by the same drugs. as shown in table  <dig>  as many as  <dig> % of d <dig> →d <dig> pairs shared drug treatments. the percentage was significantly higher than the percentages of d <dig> →d <dig> pairs that shared genetic components, indicating that two different diseases with risk-specific semantic relationships were treated with the same drugs even though they did not share any common underlying genetic mechanism. the average number of shared drugs between disease risk pairs was  <dig> , significantly higher than the number for all disease-disease combinations:  <dig> .

in summary, disease-disease risk pairs tend to share common genetic components and to be treated by the same drugs. among all  <dig>  observed disease-disease risk pairs, only a very small percentage of pairs shared any genes, indicating that we can leverage on the observed strong disease-disease risk-specific relationships to discover underlying novel genetic mechanisms. similarly, a large percentage  of d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs don’t share any drug treatments yet, indicating the usefulness of the extracted d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs in both drug target discovery and drug repositioning.

disease-disease pairs with similar risk or effect disease profiles tend to share both genes and drugs
in the previous section, we showed that a disease and its predisposing diseases  tended to share both genes and drug treatments. in this section, we investigated whether two diseases with shared risk diseases or effect diseases also shared any genes or drug treatments. as shown in figure  <dig>  a strong positive correlation between shared risk diseases or effect diseases and shared genes was evidenced. for example, the average number of shared genes for all d1-d <dig> combination pairs was  <dig>  . the number significantly increased to  <dig>  for pairs that shared at least six risk diseases and to  <dig>  for pairs that shared at least six effect diseases . in addition, the correlation was stronger for disease-disease pairs with shared risk diseases than pairs with shared effect diseases.

we observed a similar positive correlation between disease-disease pairs with shared risk diseases or effect diseases and shared genes when the disease-gene associations from the gwas studies were used . the average number of shared genes for all d1-d <dig> combination pairs was  <dig>  . the number significantly increased to  <dig>  for pairs that shared at least six risk diseases  and to  <dig>  for pairs that shared at least one effect disease . however, not many d1-d <dig> pairs  shared more than one effect disease.

a strong positive correlation between d1-d <dig> pairs with shared cause or effect diseases and shared drugs was evidenced . the average number of shared drugs for all d1-d <dig> pairs was  <dig> . the number significantly increased to  <dig>  for pairs that shared at least nine risk diseases and to  <dig>  for pairs that shared at least nine effect diseases . similar to the correlations when disease-gene associations from omim were used, the correlation was stronger for d1-d <dig> pairs with shared risk diseases than for pairs with shared effect diseases.

risk graphs for obesity and type  <dig> diabetes
in order to visualize the disease risk relationship knowledge represented in driskkb, we plotted one weighted risk graph for obesity  and one for type  <dig> diabetes  . the edge weight was determined by the ranking scores of pairs . a total of  <dig> diseases caused or were caused by obesity. the top predisposing disease identified for obesity  was hyperphagia, a serious eating disorder defined as an extreme, insatisfied drive to consume food. the second-most predisposing disorder for obesity was identified as overeating. on the other hand, the top five diseases caused by obesity  were determined to be fatty liver, metabolic disorders, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and respiratory failure.

a total of  <dig> diseases were directly linked to t2d in the driskkb . the top one predisposing disease for t2d  was identified as obesity. another predisposing disease for t2d was determined to be chronic pancreatitis. the top five diseases caused by t2d  were nephropathy, hypoglycemia, cardiovascular disease, cognitive deficits, and charcot-marie-tooth disease.

some diseases have more complicated risk graphs than that of obesity or t2d. for example, hypertension is a condition with a total of  <dig> directly linked diseases that either cause or are caused by hypertension .

discussion
we built driskkb, a disease-disease risk relationship knowledge base by developing an iterative, semi-supervised learning approach to extract a large number of disease-disease risk pairs from the over  <dig> million published medline records currently available. diseases in driskkb were linked to their known genes, snps, and drug treatments. we also systematically analyzed the relationships between disease-disease risk pairs and disease-associated genes as well as drug treatments. to the best of our knowledge, driskkb is the first large-scale disease risk relationship knowledge base built from the large corpus of published biomedical literature.

nevertheless, our study has several limitations and can be greatly improved in future studies. first, the  <dig> patterns were selected from top-ranked patterns by manually removing non-disease-risk-specific patterns such as “d <dig> and d2” and “d <dig> or d <dig> ” the limitation is that even though it is obvious that these patterns are non-disease-risk-specific, it is difficult to test it formally. second, even though driskkb is precise and consists of a total of  <dig>  disease-disease risk pairs, one of the major limitations is that we could not assess its coverage due the lack of a gold standard. third, currently, driskkb only contains the risk relationships among diseases. many factors other than disease can contribute to the risk of a disease, including genes , chemicals , life styles and behavior , family history, ethnicity, age, gender, and even microbiome in the human body. automatic extraction of the risk-specific relationship between diseases and these risk factors is a highly challenging task since no specific lexicon of these risk factors currently exists, yet such an entity is required by most information extraction systems for relationship extraction. fourth, the risk relationships among diseases are often context-sensitive. for example, in the sentence “depression is a risk factor for coronary artery disease in men,” the disease-disease-population triple “depression cause coronary artery disease in men,” rather than the disease-disease pair “depression-coronary artery disease,” better captures the context -specific risk relationships among diseases. another example is “hypertriglyceridaemia is a risk factor for coronary artery disease in diabetic populations,” where triple ‘hypertriglyceridaemia-coronary artery disease-diabetic populations’ better captured the risk relationship between the two diseases. in one of our previous studies, we developed a combined machine learning and nlp approach to accurately extract clinical trial participant information, including demographics, trial size, disease, or symptoms and their descriptors from rct abstracts  <cit> . in our future study, we will improve driskdb by automatically extracting patient characteristics from sentences.

the majority of extracted d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs  don’t share any known genes. at least three factors may account for this. first of all, not all disease-associated genes have been discovered so far. the disease-gene associations from omim or gwas may only cover a small percentage of all disease-associated genes. second, we only compared the direct gene overlap. it is possible that common genetic pathway or function modules  are responsible for the observed d <dig> →d <dig> risk semantic relationships. third, non-genetic factors such as environmental factors, diet or socioeconomic status may be responsible for the observed risk relationships among diseases. the facts that d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs shared significantly more genes than all disease combinations and that only a small percentage of the large number of observed d <dig> →d <dig> pairs shared any genes provided both motivation and opportunity for developing phenotype-driven network-based approaches to leverage on the observed strong risk-specific semantic relationships among diseases in discovering novel disease candidate genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present a semi-supervised approach in order to build a large-scale and precise disease-disease risk relationship knowledge base . the newly created driskkb consisted of a total of  <dig>  unique d <dig> →d <dig> risk pairs representing  <dig>  diseases with each linked to its associated genes and drugs. we have shown that diseases and their risk diseases as well as diseases with similar risk profiles tend to share both genes and drugs. this unique driskkb, when combined with existing phenotypic, genetic, and proteomic datasets, can have profound implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in rapid drug repositioning.
