BACKGROUND
polyadenylation including the cleavage of pre-mrna and adding a stretch of adenosines, poly, to the 3'-end is an essential stage of pre-mrna processing, which results in the generation of the mature mrna in eukaryotes. this is an important step for the stability, nucleus-to-cytoplasm export and translation initiation of mrna  <cit> . polyadenylation is also required for the proper and effective transcription termination, splicing of mrna, translation termination, as well as being involved in gene silencing  <cit>  and genomic imprinting  <cit> . although polyadenylation is a common modification of pre-mrna, it is achieved by different mechanisms in different organisms  <cit> . moreover, another type of rna polyadenylation processing with a different set of proteins has been identified recently in eukaryotes, which has been implicated in rna degradation  <cit> .

mrna polyadenylation involves  a specific endonucleolytic cleavage at the poly site and  subsequent addition of a poly tail. in mammals the poly region contains various cis acting elements that interact with the corresponding proteins of the mrna polyadenylation machine, as the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor , the cleavage stimulation factor , the cleavage factors i and ii , and the enzyme poly polymerase . all components of this machine appear to act cooperatively. in particular, the cpsf and cstf interact with each other and bind to the aauaaa hexamer  and its downstream counterpart, u/gu-rich element, respectively  <cit> .

the pas is one of the well-studied key elements, which have been shown to be involved in the regulation of mrna-polyadenylation  <cit> . the optimal  pas consists of the aauaaa motif and most base substitutions in this sequence, except the auuaaa variant, have been shown to have a significantly reduced cleavage and polyadenylation efficiency . however, the aauaaa element is not as universal a signal as it has previously been considered to be. for example, in human, only ~70% of the 3' expressed sequence tags  contain one of the two optimal pas sequences, aauaaa or auuaaa  <cit> . these findings suggest that no consensus sequences of the main cleavage and polyadenylation signals exist, but rather the cooperative action of these sequences and their binding factors results in the pre-mrna maturation. indeed, in addition to pas and the u-/gu-rich elements, a number of auxiliary elements appear to play an important role in the regulation of this process. comparative studies of the human and drosophila melanogaster polyadenylation regions show that the pas is highly conserved in these two species. however, as opposed to this, the u-rich downstream sequence element  shows a higher divergence between the two species. such a variation of the maturation process of the pre-mrna elements seems to be related to alternative polyadenylation of the same transcription unit  <cit> .

a growing line of evidence indicates that most pre-mrnas undergo alternative polyadenylation and this mechanism, altogether with alternative transcription initiation and splicing, are used by eukaryotic organisms to produce a diverse number of mature mrna transcripts from the same transcription unit. this is further confirmed by the fact that splicing and polyadenylation appear to be coupled co-transcriptional events of pre-mrna maturation. it has been shown that more than half of the human genes have multiple poly sites, which can potentially produce transcripts with variable 3'-untranslated regions  potentially encoding in many cases different proteins  <cit> . besides, polyadenylation in the intronic regions can result in conversion of an internal exon to a 3'-terminal exon  or usage of a 3'-terminal exon that is otherwise skipped . it has been shown that about 20% of human genes have, at least, one intron with polyadenylation site which can potentially produce alternative mrnas encoding different proteins. the conservation of poly signals in introns of mouse and rat genes is lower than that of poly sites in gene ends. moreover, the intronic polyadenylation activity appears to be dependent on cellular conditions, 5'-splice sites and intron size: larger introns with weaker donor splice sites prevail among exons used as composite terminal exons, whereas skipped terminal exons are associated mostly with strong polyadenylation signals  <cit> . both bioinformatics and experimental studies indicate that utilizing intronic alternative poly site in human and mouse cstf- <dig> gene, which encodes one of the three subunits of the cstf, as well as in its drosophila homologue, produces short cstf- <dig> transcripts lacking sequences encoding some of the functional domains of cstf- <dig>  <cit> . computational analysis of 3'-ends of ests suggested the existence of four classes of alternative polyadenylation in human, mouse, and rat: tandem poly sites, composite exons, hidden exons, and truncated exons. it was estimated that about 49% of the human, 31% of the mouse, and 28% of the rat polyadenylated transcription units have alternative polyadenylation sites, which result in the generation of new protein isoforms  <cit> . recently, muro et al.  <cit>  reported that about 60% of human and murine genes utilize multiple  polyadenylation sites. all available data, briefly reviewed above, indicate the importance of accurate identification of polyadenylation sites in genes. of course, the most accurate approach for the solution of this problem is mapping of the full-length cdnas onto the genomic sequences. however, till date a complete set of full-length cdnas is not available, clustering and dna mapping studies of human and murine est databases reveals that of the currently known genes, 15% have no est-supported 3'end. in other words, the 3'-termini of a significant portion of known genes from these species remains to be identified  <cit> . similar results have been obtained by lopez et al.  <cit> . therefore, the computational prediction of poly sites becomes very important. however, it is also a challenge for the following reasons:  there are gaps in our knowledge on regulation and performance of mrna polyadenylation;  dna signals and regulatory proteins, involved in the transcription termination, are still poorly described;  polyadenylation appears to be tissue- and organism-specific, and also many genes utilize alternative points of polyadenylation;  available data of poly sites are very limited: the real transcriptional status of a genome, dependence of cell/tissue/organ, developmental stage and environmental conditions, is unknown;  poly sites may exist in coding sequences  and introns. the last two points create additional problems in getting true positive and negative data sets necessary for learning and testing of any computational tool.

to date, using both experimental and in silico mapping of 3'-end ests, thousands of poly sites have been identified and analyzed  <cit> . based on these data, during the last  <dig> years, a number of attempts have been made to define the consensus sequences involved in the pre-mrna polyadenylation and to develop computer tools for prediction of poly sites. by analyzing known human poly sites, yada et al.  <cit>  suggested caauaaa as a consensus of the poly signal. kondrakhin et al.  <cit>  computed a general consensus matrix for  <dig> poly sites in vertebrate pre-mrnas and implemented it into the computational method for the recognition of polyadenylation points in mrna. however, all these methods had a very high false positive rate. later, salamov and solovyev  <cit> , applying a linear discriminant function -based algorithm, trained on  <dig> real poly  signal regions and  <dig> other regions of human genes with seemingly nonfunctional aauaaa motif, developed the computer program polyah. in comparison with the previous analogous methods, the accuracy of this latter approach, which has been tested on a larger data set, was better . tabaska and zhang  <cit>  developed the polyadq program, which used two quadratic discriminant functions for the aauaaa/auuaaa motifs and a position weight matrix for the downstream elements. in tests on whole genes and the last two exons of genes, polyadq predicted poly signals with a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. legendre and gautheret  <cit>  developed the erpin program based on a probabilistic hidden markov model, which achieved a prediction specificity of  <dig> to 85% for a sensitivity of 56%. by analyzing about  <dig> est-validated poly sites from human genes, some sequence determinants of human poly regions were suggested: u-rich upstream and downstream sequence elements  appear to be the main characteristics distinguishing true poly sites from randomly occurring auaaa hexamers; while uses were found to be indiscriminately associated with strong and weak poly sites, dses are mostly found near strong poly sites. to recognize poly region of saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  and caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , the weight-matrix-only approaches have been developed. to identify pass, bajic et al.  <cit>  have developed another program, dragon polyatt, the accuracy of which was substantially better than that obtained by the polyadq program. it predicted the two most frequent poly sites, aauaaa and auuaaa, with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and specificity of 74% and  <dig> %, respectively.

using a hexamer enrichment method, probe, hu et al.  <cit>  revealed the prevalence of some u-rich and g-rich elements in human poly regions: aues  site), cues , cdes  and ades . further studies of poly regions by applying position-specific scoring matrixes  for these motifs revealed the presence of  <dig> elements upstream or downstream of the poly site that were suggested to play a role in determining polyadenylation sites.

the latest computational method for the prediction of poly sites is polya_svm, which uses support vector machine  and previously identified  <dig> cis-motifs for the prediction of the poly sites. compared with polyadq, this method achieves higher sensitivity though with similar specificity  <cit> .

however, there is still room for improvement in the accuracy of these tools, especially for genome-wide searches. in the current work we report the development of a new tool, polyar, for the recognition of poly sites in human and closely related mammals. the prediction accuracy of this computer program is significantly higher than that of previously developed tools.

methods
training and testing datasets
using positions of the human mapped poly sites from polya_db http://polya.umdnj.edu/polya_db1/ and genbank annotation of human genome ,  <dig> sequences of  <dig> bp length surrounding the mapped poly site  at position  <dig>  were extracted. to select non-redundant poly sequences, the pairwise comparison of  regions by the blast program  <cit>  was performed and the non-redundant positive learning and training dataset of  <dig> poly regions showing less than 90% pairwise similarity were selected. these poly regions, here after referred to as "polya db set", represent  <dig> genes. applying the same approach, the non-redundant negative set was created. for comparative purposes the polya_svm program  <cit>  was trained and tested on all the  <dig> mapped sites.

studies of pas motifs upstream of the mapped poly sites revealed  <dig> different forms of this hexamer; whereas the remaining variations of the pas-motif have been suggested to be non-functional  <cit> . out of these  <dig> forms two pas-motifs, aauaaa or auuaaa, are found in about 70% of the human mapped poly sites. to explain the variations in the pas-motifs, it was suggested that a site of pre-mrna cleavage and polyadenylation should be determined by the combination of pas-motif and some other dna elements, together with their binding factors  <cit> . taking into account these observations and suggestions, and applying expectation maximization  approach  <cit> , poly sites were differentiated into  <dig> classes:  pas-strong poly sites with the aauaaa or auuaaa motifs;  pas-weak poly sites with the remaining  <dig> forms of pas-motif: aguaaa, uauaaa, cauaaa, gauaaa, aauaua, aauaca, aauaga, acuaaa, aagaaa and aaugaa;  pas-less poly sites which lack any of these  <dig> forms. such a grouping of poly sites into  <dig> classes differs from the classification criterion used by cheng et al.  <cit> : poly sites are divided into different groups based  on their usage  and location ; as opposed to the classification criterion used in the current study is based only on sequence variation in pas motifs.

applying our classification criteria, the  <dig> sequences were divided into  <dig> pas-strong,  <dig> pas-weak and  <dig> pas-less poly sites. as the training positive datasets,  <dig> pas-strong,  <dig> pas-weak and  <dig> pas-less sequences were taken; the remaining sequences were reserved for the testing procedure. for the training and initial testing, ,  and  regions for pas-strong, pas-weak and pas-less poly sites were used, respectively, where different upstream and downstream regions for different pas groups were selected by criterion based upon mahalonobis distance and further ldf-scoring for pentamers ; for the comparative testing of our approach, the polya_svm http://exon.umdnj.edu/polya_svm and polyadq http://rulai.cshl.org/tools/polyadq/polyadq_form.html programs, these regions were extended up to .

to get a set of negative false poly, sequences, the coding sequences  of only "head-to-head"  genes annotated  were extracted, because there is a less chance of the existence of polyadenylation sites in the intergenic spacer between these pairs . the middle parts of these cdss  were then divided into non-overlapping fragments of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp  sites, respectively) and taken as the negative datasets. using this method  <dig>  sequences  were obtained. in addition, using pairwise blast comparison non-redundant subset of the h <dig> h set of  <dig>  sequences were obtained. to test the specificity of the current approach, the polya_svm and polyadq programs, we extracted cdss of  <dig> human genes,  <dig> human intronic sequences and  <dig> 5'-utr regions, and generated  <dig> randomized poly  site regions  site sequences).

description of the method
to recognize true poly sites, the technique of linear discriminant analysis was used. it was assumed that the site of mrna cleavage/polyadenylation is determined by some sequence characteristics surrounding the cs, though they may have different weights in the recognition function reflecting their relative significance of recognition. the technique of discriminant analysis allows classification of a given sequence with p characteristics  into one of two alternative classes: class  <dig> of true poly sites or class  <dig> of false poly sites. the procedure of linear discriminant analysis is to find a linear combination  of these characteristics, that provides maximum discrimination between real and pseudo sites. ldf is given by the formula:

  z=∑i=1paixi 

that classifies given a sequence into class  <dig>  if z > c, or into class  <dig>  if z≤c; x <dig> ..., xk are characteristics of used for recognition of a true site. the vector of coefficients a→ and threshold constant c are derived from the training sets by maximizing the ratio of the "between-class" variation of z to "within-class" variation and are calculated by the formulas  <cit> :

  a→=s− <dig> 

  c=a→/ <dig> 

where m→ <dig> and m→ <dig> are the sample mean vectors of characteristics for class  <dig> and class  <dig>  respectively; s is the pooled covariance matrix of characteristics for class  <dig> and class 2; si is covariation matrix, and ni is the sample size of class i.

significance of a given characteristic or set of characteristics can be estimated by the generalized distance between two classes :

  d→2=s− <dig> 

applying step-wise discriminant procedure for a set of features, suggested to be involved in determination of poly site, for every class of poly sites  the subset of significant characteristics significantly increasing the mahalonobis distance was selected .

* location of cs-motif:  for pas-strong and pas-weak sites;  for pas-less sites.

pas-motif
region  was used to search for aauaaa or auuaaa forms of pas-motif with the highest score. an element w of the signal weight matrix is the frequency of base b  at position i of the pas-motif calculated on the training samples. any candidate pas-motif was scored using the formula:

  score=16∑i=16w 

only sequences with pas-motif having a score higher than some threshold  were considered as candidate poly sites.

cs-motif
using position weight matrix of the fixed region,  for the pas-strong and pas-weak poly sequences, and  for the pas-less poly sequences, candidate cs-motifs were scored by the formula:

  score=1k∑i=1kw 

where w is the frequency of base b at position i of the k-mer candidate cs-motif; k =  <dig> for pas-strong and pas-weak sites, and k =  <dig> for pas-less sites .

gu/u-motif
position weight matrix for the 10-mer gu/u-motif, obtained from the positive training samples by applying expectation maximization  <cit>  in the  region, was used to search for the gu/u-motif with the highest score. candidate gu/u-motifs were scored by the formula:

  score=110∑i=110w 

where w is the frequency of base b at position i of the 10-mer candidate gu/u-motif.

pentamer composition of upstream and downstream regions
assuming that a priori probabilities for any pentanucleotide in both upstream and downstream regions  of positive and negative samples are equal, bayesian probability of observation of pentanucleotide sk  in the corresponding region can be calculated by the following formula:

  p=fpfp+fn 

where fp and fn are the frequencies of the pentanucleotide sk in the corresponding region of positive and negative training samples, respectively. as pentanucleotide preference characteristics of the upstream region, the average value of this probability was taken as follows  <cit> :

  score=156∑i=156p 

where p is p for hexamer sk starting in the position i  sequences see additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively).

distance between pas- and cs-motifs
in pas-strong and pas-weak poly datasets, authentic pas-motif shows spatial preferences with respect to the cs. therefore, the distance between pas-motif and cs  is used as one of the significant features for recognition of poly sites. this feature is scored by using frequencies of distances between pas-motif and cs in the positive training sets:

  score=f 

where f is the frequency of a distance betweem pas-motif and cs observed in sequences from the corresponding positive training dataset.

distance between cs and gu/u-motifs
in all three classes of poly sites, authentic gu/u-motif shows spatial preferences with respect to the cs. therefore, the distance between cs and gu/u-motif  was used as one of the valuable features for the recognition of poly sites. this feature is scored by using frequencies of distances between cs and gu/u-motif in the positive training sets:

  score=f 

where f is the frequency of a distance betweem cs and gu/u motif observed in sequences from the corresponding positive training dataset.

most of these features were kept the same for all  <dig> classes of poly sequences, though there was also some difference, and the discriminating abilities of these features were different . in particular, for pas-strong and pas-weak poly sequences pas-motif is the most significant feature.

the total score for every candidate site was computed by formula  <cit> , with the sub-scores for the corresponding features calculated by using the formulas  <cit> .

estimation of prediction accuracy
sensitivity , specificity  and correlation coefficient  of predictions were calculated by using the following formulas:

  snp=tptp+fn 

  snn=tntn+fp 

  sp=tptp+fp 

  cc=tp×tn−fp×fn 

where tp - true positives, tn - true negatives, fp - false positives, fn - false negatives, snp and snn - sensitivity of predictions in sets of positive and negative samples, respectively.

RESULTS
the algorithm described above was realized in the polyar  program. in the first step, the polyar program classifies each position  on a given sequence as a potential cs or non-cs based on three ldf classifiers for pas-strong, pas-weak and pas-less poly sites, with characteristics calculated in the ,  and  regions around the current position, respectively . in the case of pas-strong and pas-weak poly sites, only positions with pas-motif in the region  having a score higher than a preliminary defined threshold are selected for further consideration. first, the ldf for a position is estimated by the classifier for pas-strong sites; if it is not classified as pas-strong site, the ldf for that position is estimated by the classifier for pas-weak sites; otherwise it is estimated by the classifier for pas-less sites. estimation of ldfs for the candidate positions is performed by applying thresholds for pas-strong, pas-weak and pas-less poly sites defined on the training dataset. for the final selection of potential css, the following criterion is applied:

 for any pair of predicted pas-strong and pas-weak css, or pas-strong and pas-weak css, within  <dig> bp of each other, only pas-strong site is retained;

 for any pair of predicted pas-weak and pas-less css, within  <dig> bp of each other, only pas-weak site is retained;

 for any pair of predicted css of the same class, within  <dig> bp of each other, only the one with the highest score is retained.

the learning and testing procedures were repeated  <dig> times for all three classes of poly sites. in all these training and testing procedures, randomly created sets of non-cs sequences and the same cs sequences described above were used. for all three classes of poly sites, the same number of sequences from cs and non-cs sets were taken. results of the initial testing in a single window of ,  and  for pas-strong, pas-weak and pas-less poly sites, respectively, are summarized in table  <dig> 

pas-strong
pas-week
pas-less
* sensitivity was calculated by formula  <cit> .

striking differences in the accuracy of predictions in the  <dig> sets were observed: quite high prediction sensitivity and correlation coefficient for the pas-strong sequences contradict with very low sensitivity and correlation coefficient for the pas-weak and pas-less sequences. such a variation in accuracy of predictions indicates that we are still far from understanding the regulatory architecture of pre-mrna 3'-end processing regions lacking the upstream strong pas site. this gap in our knowledge seems to be a general problem rather than a challenge inherent only in the current approach.

moreover, the real task of poly site prediction is quite different from just discriminating between cs and non-cs regions: the most probable poly site in a long genomic sequence should be identified. therefore, we tested the polyar recognition algorithm on genomic sequences and compared its performance with polya_svm, till date the most accurate tool for prediction of human poly sites  <cit> , and polyadq program  <cit> . all three programs were tested on five sets of sequences:   regions relative to the mapped css  from  <dig> pas-strong,  <dig> pas-weak and  <dig> pas-less test sequences;  coding sequences  of  <dig> human genes;   <dig> human intronic sequences;  5'-utr sequences of  <dig> human genes;   <dig> randomized poly  site regions generated by simple randomization of original poly site sequences, with the same nucleotide frequency. moreover, we tested polyar and polya_svm also on  gene end  regions of  <dig> sequences with the mapped poly site around the  gene end .

pas-strong
pas-weak
pas-less
* sensitivity and specificity was calculated by formulas  <cit>  and  <cit> , respectively.

for the pas-strong sites, polyar was found to be more sensitive than polya_svm and polyadq , as well as it being significantly higher in specificity  than polya_svm. at the same time, by comparison with polyar, polyadq showed slightly higher specificity . the last finding, probably, results from the totally low predictive power of polyadq program. for pas-weak sites, both polyar and polya_svm show very low sensitivity and specificity at almost the same level . for pas-less sites the lowest sensitivity and specificity of prediction by both programs was observed, though the sensitivity of polyar was higher .

analysis of  regions around the annotated end of  <dig> genes by polyar and polya_svm programs revealed at least one poly site for  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively. with taking only predicted poly sites closest to the gene end, distribution of distances between gene end and predicted cleavage site are presented in figure  <dig>  out of the closest css, about 95%  and 85%  sites were predicted by polyar and polya_svm, respectively, which are located within ±  <dig> nt around the gene end annotated. polyar and polya_svm, altogether, predicted cs within ±  <dig> nt around the end of  <dig> genes; out of these,  <dig> sites were predicted by both programs and  <dig> and  <dig> sites by only polyar or polya_svm, respectively. interestingly, the program shows almost the same accuracy in analysis of mouse and rat gene end sequences .

at last, a search for cs/poly sites in the coding sequences of  <dig> human genes and  <dig> human intronic sequences, as well as in  <dig> 5'-utr and  <dig> randomized poly  site regions was performed . in this analysis, under the assumption that cdss, introns, 5'-utr and randomized poly regions do not contain real cs, false positives and true negatives were computed as number of sequences with at least one site predicted or without any putative site, respectively. in case of cds sequences, searching for poly sites of all  <dig> classes altogether, polyar and polya_svm programs demonstrated very close sensitivity, though sensitivity of polyadq was higher. however, in a search for pas-strong or pas-weak or pas-less poly sites separately, polyar was found to be definitely a more sensitive program, than polya_svm; polyar and polyadq showed very close sensitivity. for 5'-utr sequences, in comparison with polya_svm, sensitivity of polyar and polyadq was higher. in case of randomized poly site regions, all  <dig> programs showed close sensitivity. as to intronic sequences, in comparison with polyar, both polya_svm and polyadq show higher sensitivity. in this regard, it should be noted that intronic sequences are, seemingly, not the best candidates for the negative control training and testing. thus, about 20% of human genes have, at least, one intron with polyadenylation site which can potentially produce alternative mrnas, though the conservation of poly signals in introns of mouse and rat genes is lower than that of poly sites in gene ends. moreover, the intronic polyadenylation activity appears to be dependent on cellular conditions, 5'-splice sites and intron size: larger introns with weaker donor splice sites prevail among exons used as composite terminal exons, whereas skipped terminal exons are associated mostly with strong polyadenylation signals  <cit> . muro et al.  <cit>  found that about 60% of human and murine genes utilize multiple  polyadenylation sites. at last, about 16% of mapped poly  sites, used in our studies, are located in introns or internal exons  <cit> .

 <dig> search for poly sites of all  <dig> classes. 2- <dig> search for only pas-strong, pas-weak and pas-less poly sites, respectively.  <dig> totally predicted sites.  <dig> sensitivity was calculated by formula  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
searching for pas-strong cs/poly sites in human sequences, the polyar program, as compared to the polya_svm and polyadq programs, had a significantly higher prediction sensitivity . polyar has also higher specificity than polya_svm . however, polyadq showed slightly higher specificity  than polyar, which may be due to the totally low predictive power of polyadq program. at the same time, in search for pas-weak and pas-less css both polyar and polya_svm programs show very low prediction accuracy. moreover, polyar program shows almost the same accuracy in analysis of mouse and rat gene end sequences . these observations indicate that the current knowledge about factors  involved in the selection of poly sites is not sufficient to identify polyadenylation regions containing neither aauaaa nor auuaaa signals. therefore, it is important to identify the additional characteristics involved in determining the"pas-weak" and "pas-less" cs/poly sites. in particular, we can not exclude that an alternative criterion is required for classification of poly sites with degenerated or without pas-by signal: there may be different signal which initiate the polyadenylation of pre-mrna. if this assumption is true, then regrouping of such poly sites into new sub-classes might allow to reveal new conservative motifs around polyadenylation points. our studies along these lines are continuing.
