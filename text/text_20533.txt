BACKGROUND
rubber tree  is the main source of natural rubber  <cit> . the natural rubber is synthesized and stored in laticifer, a specific tissue densely located in the secondary phloem of trunk  <cit> . by successive tapping, white or yellowish milky latex is expelled and collected. the latex is the cytoplasm of laticifer cells and used to refine natural rubber. it contains numerous rubber particles and lutoids as well as general eukaryotic organelles  <cit> .

latex regeneration and duration of latex flow after tapping are important factors that determine rubber yield of rubber tree. sucrose, water and nitrogen sources supplying from the surrounding parenchyma cells act as raw materials for latex regeneration between two tappings  <cit> . isopentenyl pyrophosphate  is the direct precursor for rubber biosynthesis and mainly derived from the mva pathway although 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathway is suggested to be an alternative source  <cit> . catalyzing by enzymes as prenyltransferase, the rubber transferase, ipp initiates the subsequent extensive prenyl chain elongation process for the formation of rubber macromolecules. it is well known that tapping can promote latex regeneration and there is obvious difference in the rubber content of latex among varieties upon ethrel stimulation  <cit> . the duration of latex flow is influenced by various factors, such as laticifer turgor, plug formation at the end of severed laticifer, and ethrel application. plugging of severed laticifer end leads to the termination of latex flow from the wounded site of rubber trees and has been a key limiting factor for the yield of hevea  <cit> . it is widely believed that the severed laticifers are plugged by rubber coagulum as a result of rubber particle aggregation  caused by the bursting of lutoids  <cit> . inclusions and debris of lutoids from the burst lutoids are effective in rubber particle aggregation  <cit> .

with the sequence technology development, digital gene expression tag profiling recently displays huge potential for exploring biological process  <cit> . by using next-generation massively parallel sequencing technologies, triwitayakorn et al. sequenced  <dig> , <dig> reads from rubber tree vegetative shoot apex transcriptome, generating  <dig> linkage groups covering  <dig>  cm with a mean interval of  <dig>  cm per linkage group  <cit> . xia et al. de novo assembled  <dig>  unigenes from transcriptome data of leave and latex of rubber tree in an effort to facilitate biological, biochemical and molecular researches on rubber biosynthesis  <cit> . li et al. generated  <dig>  unigenes from rubber tree bark transcritome and obtained  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  markers which may be benefit for marker-assisted selection in the cross breeding program of rubber tree  <cit> . mantello et al. assembled  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig> bp from h. brasiliensis bark transcritome, and detected  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . in the present study, a comparative analysis of latex transcriptome between rubber tree clone pr <dig> and catas8- <dig> was performed to uncover the molecular mechanism for the regulation of latex regeneration and duration of latex flow.

RESULTS
difference in latex regeneration and duration of latex flow between rubber tree clone pr <dig> and catas8-79
rubber tree clone catas8- <dig> and pr <dig> exhibited a huge difference in duration of latex flow  and latex regeneration  at each tapping. a total of about  <dig> ml of latex was gained from catas8- <dig> while only about  <dig> ml of latex from pr <dig> by four tappings . the rubber content of latex, however, showed no difference between two clones at each tapping . consequently, rubber yield of catas8- <dig> was significantly higher than that of pr <dig> , suggesting latex regeneration in catas8- <dig> was more effective than that in pr <dig> during the interval of successive tappings.figure  <dig> the difference in duration of latex flow , latex regeneration , rubber content of latex  and dry rubber production  between catas8- <dig> and pr <dig> upon successive tappings. significant difference was indicated by the asterisks above the bars . tapping no. represented tapping number.



assembling, annotation of latex transcriptome
rna were extracted from catas8- <dig> and pr <dig> at first tapping and sequenced with illumina paired-end sequencing technology individually. after excluding low-quality reads such as empty adapters,  <dig> million clean reads were generated in each pool. using soapdenove software,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs ranging from  <dig> bp to more than  <dig>  bp were respectively assembled from catas8- <dig> and pr <dig> . by paired-end and gap-filling, contigs were further extended and finally assembled as a long sequence named “unigenes”. in this way,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were generated from catas8- <dig> and pr <dig> individually. the unigenes were further integrated into  <dig>  all-unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp and a n <dig> of  <dig> bp by paired-end joining . the analyses following were carried out with all-unigenes .table  <dig>

all the integrated unigenes were used to match against both the ncbi non-redundant  and swissprot protein databases using blastx program with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  of which,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes were positively matched with nr protein database and swissprot protein database, respectively . clusters of orthologous group  analysis showed that  <dig>  unigenes could be divided into  <dig> categories . of which, “general function predicted only” represented the largest group , followed by “transcription” , and “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” . categories of “extracellular structures” and “nuclear structure” only included  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes whereas  <dig> unigenes were classified into the category of “carbohydrate transport and metabolism”.figure  <dig> classification and detection of differentially expressed unigenes.  histogram of clusters of cog classifications of h. brasiliensis unigenes. numbers on the y-axis represent the uingenes numbers.  validation of dge by qrt-pcr. the left showed qrt-pcr and the right showed dge data. error bars for qrt-pcr show the standard deviation of three replicates. unigene <dig>  brassinosteroid insensitive 1; unigene <dig>  cellulose synthase; unigene <dig>  4-coumarate-coa ligase; unigene <dig>  aux/iaa protein; unigene <dig>  beta- <dig> -glucanase; unigene <dig>  glutamine synthetase; unigene <dig>  hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase; unigene <dig>  jasmonate o-methyltransferase; unigene <dig>  1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; unigene <dig>  1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; unigene <dig>  beta-amylase  <dig> 



by comparative analysis of transcriptome data of catas8- <dig> versus pr <dig> under condition of fdr ≤  <dig>  and |log <dig> ratio| ≥  <dig>  there were  <dig>  unigenes with differential expression. of which,  <dig>  were up-regulated while  <dig>  were down-regulated. “up-regulated” means the level of gene transcripts was higher in pr <dig> whereas “down-regulated” means the level of gene transcripts was higher in catas8- <dig>  to validate the digital gene expression ,  <dig> unigenes were selected to amplify by qrt-pcr in the latex samples from catas8- <dig> and pr <dig>  these unigenes were different in abundance and expression pattern on the basis of dge data. the expression pattern of most of them by qrt-pcr was similar to the corresponding dge data .

functional analysis of the enriched categories in catas8- <dig> and pr107
kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis of all the differently expressed unigenes showed that mass of categories was differentially enriched between catas8- <dig> and pr <dig>  some of these differences may be related to the difference in latex regeneration and duration of latex flow between the two clones. the others may associate with the general difference in genetic background, considering that catas8- <dig> only contained one fourth descent of pr <dig> 

most of unigenes related to categories of stress-related proteins, cell wall biosynthesis and nitrogen requirement were significant up-regulated in pr <dig> . one unigene encoding for chitinase, eight unigenes for glucanase were detected in dge data , and unigene  <dig> encoding beta- <dig> -glucanase was analyzed by qrt-pcr . glutamate synthase  plays a key role in integrating nh <dig> into amino acid, which is crucial for nitrogen requirement  <cit> . recently, there is evidence that gs can directly regulate lignin biosynthesis and deposition in rice seeding  <cit> . nine unigenes encoding for enzymes involving in glutamine metabolism were up-regulated in pr <dig> , and one of them, unigene <dig>  was analyzed by qrt-pcr . several unigenes involving cellulose and lignin metabolism were widely activated in rubber clone pr <dig>  lignin is a component of cell wall and synthesized through shikimate pathway  <cit> . unigenes encoding 4-coumarate-coa ligase , cinnamoyl-coa reductase , the key enzymes in shikimate pathway were analyzed by qrt-pcr .figure  <dig> histogram of metabolism categories enrichment in up-/down-regulation parts. number in brackets showed corresponding unigenes detected in transcriptome.



by contrast, most of unigenes related to categories of carbohydrate metabolism, rubber biosynthesis, hormone, and antioxidation were up-regulated in catas8- <dig> . carbohydrate metabolism could provide carbon skeleton for the formation of various organic compounds  <cit> . dge analysis showed that plenty of unigenes associating with carbohydrate metabolism were up-regulated, and the expression pattern of several unigenes mediating sucrose transportation , starch degradation  and glycolysis  were analyzed by qrt-pcr . both mva and mep pathways provide ipp, a precursor for the formation of final rubber molecule  <cit> . in the present study, unigenes encoding 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase , 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase  that is components of mep pathway, and encoding hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase  and acetyl coenzyme a acetyltransferase  that is the key enzymes of mva pathway were notably up-regulated in catas8- <dig> . of which, unigene <dig> for hmgr, unigene <dig> for dxr, unigene <dig> for hdr were analyzed by qrt-pcr . additionally, unigenes encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase , geranyl-diphosphate synthase , hevea rubber transferase  <dig>  which directly participated in the formation of the final high-molecular weight rubber molecule were also differentially expressed . fdps and hrt2-related unigenes were up-regulated in catas8- <dig> whereas gpps-related unigene was up-regulated in pr <dig>  respectively . jasmonates were pivotal to the secondary laticifer differentiation while ethylene was most effective in prolonging the duration of latex flow upon tapping in rubber tree  <cit> . in the present study, the up-regulated unigenes in ja signaling pathway in catas8- <dig> included unigene  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , and  <dig> . and the up-regulated unigenes in ethylene signaling pathway were unigene  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  . of which, unigene  <dig> for lox and unigene  <dig> for aco were analyzed by qrt-pcr . whereas five of six unigenes  encoding ethylene response factors were up-regulated in pr <dig>  in addition, antioxidants antagonized reactive oxygen species -caused membrane lipid peroxidation and had a role in keeping the integrity of lutoid  <cit> . the unigene  <dig> and  <dig> encoding l-ascorbate peroxidase  and superoxide dismutase  were up-regulated in catas8- <dig>  respectively .figure  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes involving hormone, carbohydrate and rubber biosynthesis processes. the left showed qrt-pcr and the right showed dge data in each schematic. error bars for qrt-pcr showed the standard deviation of three replicates.



expression pattern of unigenes related to latex regeneration and duration of latex flow upon successive tapping
eleven unigenes with differential expression between the two clones have been demonstrated to participate in latex regeneration or duration of latex flow. for this purpose, their expression patterns upon successive tapping were analyzed by qrt-pcr . six of the eleven unigenes exhibited a big difference in their expression patterns between catas8- <dig> and pr <dig>  of which, unigene  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were up-regulated and kept significant high level in pr <dig> while similar expression pattern of unigene  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  occurred in catas8- <dig> . the expression pattern of the other five unigenes was similar between the two clones .figure  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of the expression pattern of latex regeneration and expelling related genes upon successive tappings. error bars for qrt-pcr showed the standard deviation of three replicates.



discussion
the rubber tree clone pr <dig> is an original clone selected from wickham germplasm in 1920s. the rubber tree clone catas8- <dig> was selected from hybrid offspring of catas88- <dig> and catas <dig>  the catas88- <dig> is the product of rrim <dig> and pilb <dig> cross while the catas <dig> is selected from the cross of rrim <dig> and pr <dig>  the rrim <dig> are selected from the cross of tjir <dig> and pb <dig> while rrim <dig> is the hybrid offspring of pilb <dig> and pila <dig>  as there is a significant difference in duration of latex flow and latex regeneration between catas8- <dig> and pr <dig>  analysis of the transcriptome dataset of pr <dig> against that of catas8- <dig> will be prospect to dissect key genes mediating the process. some of the differentially expressed unigenes should be related to the difference in latex regeneration and duration of latex flow although the others may associate with the general difference in genetic background, considering that catas8- <dig> only contained one fourth descent of pr <dig> 

it has long been believed that the efficiency of sucrose transportation and metabolism and rubber biosynthesis closely associates with the ability of latex regeneration between interval of successive tappings  <cit> . amylase, a member of glycosyl hydrolases, is activated at weakly alkaline ph  <cit> . one of the effects of ethrel is to enhance carbohydrate metabolism by alkalizing cytosol of laticifer cells  <cit> , which may be ascribed to the activation of amylase. besides, ethrel treatment can greatly up-regulate the expression of sut genes in rubber tree  <cit> . in the present study, several unigenes encoding beta-amylases and suts are found to be expressed at higher level in catas8- <dig> than that in pr <dig>  suggesting a more efficiency of sucrose transportation and carbohydrate metabolism occurred in catas8- <dig> . ipp is biosynthesized though both mva and mep pathway and runs several enzymatic reactions to form the final high-molecular weight rubber molecule  <cit> . in present study, five unigenes encoding for hmgr and six unigenes encoding for hdr are detected with differently expression between two clones. further sequence analysis shows four hdr-like members  are perfectly blasted to one hbhdr with a genbank number eu <dig> whereas five hmgr-like unigenes are matched to three hbhmgr genes  respectively. previous work shows that the transcripts of hbhmgr <dig> are most abundant in latex  <cit> . the present study shows that hmgr1-like unigenes are significantly up-regulated in catas8- <dig> while hbhdr displays a similar pattern between the two clones, suggesting hmgr <dig> in mva pathway is critical for providing ipp.

post-ipp processes include initiation and elongation of rubber macromolecules. fdps family catalyzes the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate . the fdp acts as the prime which is essential for initiating prenyl chain whereas hrt family is crucial for integrating ipp units into prenyl chain  <cit> . two members of hrt family  are reported in rubber tree  <cit> . in vitro analysis shows that only hrt <dig> has rubber transferase activity and may play a key role in extending prenyl chain  <cit> . in this study, unigenes related to hrt <dig> and fdps are found to be expressed at higher level in catas8- <dig> than that in pr <dig>  indicating that hrt <dig> and fdps are crucial for enhancing rubber initiation and elongation. the higher expression level of hrt <dig> and fdps like unigenes is in line with the higher rubber yield per tapping .

jasmonate signaling plays a pivotal role in activating the secondary laticifer differentiation and activating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  <cit> . although several members of coi1-jaz-mcy module have been characterized in rubber tree and ja signaling is suggested to have an important role in regulating rubber biosynthesis in laticifer cells  <cit> , the difference in the level of endogenous jas in laticifer cells among hevea germplasm remains largely unknown. the present study suggests that the level of endogenous jas may be higher in the laticifer cells of catas 8- <dig> than that in the laticifer cells of pr <dig>  considering that the expression of unigenes encoding enzymes such as lox, opdr, jmt is significantly up-regulated in catas8- <dig> 

ethrel, an ethylene releaser, is very effective in prolonging duration of latex flow  <cit> . one of the explanations for ethrel-induced prolongation of latex flow is its effect on maintaining the turgor pressure of laticifer and surrounding liber cells via its differential regulation on the aquaporins on the plasma membrane and tonoplast  <cit> . considering that unigenes such as aco, ethylene overproduction protein and ein3-binding f-box protein are up-regulated in catas8- <dig>  the activity of ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction in the laticifer cells of catas 8- <dig> may be higher than that of pr <dig>  besides, such factors as laticifer turgor, antioxidants, inclusions and debris of lutoid, and proteins in c-serum are suggested to influence the duration of latex flow  <cit> . after tapping, the bursting of lutoid particles leads to the release of hevein, chitinase, and glucanase. these protein inclusions are effective in rubber particle aggregation  <cit> . in the present study, it is the unigene encoding for glucanase other than the unigenes encoding for hevein and chitinase that is significantly up-regulated in pr <dig>  suggesting that glucanase is more important in inducing rubber particle aggregation. the turgor pressure of laticifer in catas8- <dig> is significantly higher than that in pr <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, the unigenes enconding for enzymes  of cellulose and lignin biosynthesis are highly activated in rp <dig>  this suggests that difference in turgor pressure may primarily associate with the difference in lignin content of laticifer cell wall between the two clones.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, comparative transcriptome analysis reveals new cues at molecular level for the difference in duration of latex flow and latex regeneration between rubber tree clone catas8- <dig> and pr <dig> . up-regulated expression of unigenes hblox and hbopdr in the pathway of ja biosynthesis, hbsut, hbbam and hbpk mediating carbohydrate metabolism, hbhmgr <dig> in mva parthway and hbhrt <dig> directly in rubber biosynthesis is important for enhanced latex regeneration. it may be essential for prolonging duration of latex flow that up-regulated expression of unigenes hbaco mediating ethylene biosynthesis, hbapx and hbsod for antagonizing reactive oxygen species, but down-regulated expression of unigenes hb4cl and hbccr in the pathway of lignin biosynthesis and hbgluc for rubber particle aggregation.figure  <dig> schematic representation of differentially expressed unigenes related to latex regeneration and duration of latex flow in laticifer cell. red colors showed unigenes up-regulated in pr <dig> while down-regulated in catas8- <dig>  blue colors showed unigenes up-regulated in catas8- <dig> while down-regulated in pr <dig>  numbers represented log <dig> values in dge data. the dashed arrows indicated multiple steps of enzymatic reactions.
