BACKGROUND
carotenoids are organic pigments commonly present in plants, photosynthetic algae and some species of fungi and bacteria. they are normally associated with thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and often provide the yellow, orange and red pigmentation to many flowers, fruits and roots  <cit> . in plants, carotenoids play an important role in photosynthesis, photo-oxidative protection  <cit> , and represent the substrate for the synthesis of apocarotenoid hormones, such as abscisic acid and strigolactones  <cit> . carotenoid actions and their relation to human health and disease have been widely reviewed  <cit> . carotenoids and some of their metabolites are suggested to play a protective role in a number of reactive oxygen species -mediated conditions, such as, i.e., cardiovascular diseases, several types of cancer or neurological, as well as photosensitive or eye-related disorders.

carotenoids are typically divided into two classes: carotenes, which are tetraterpenoid hydrocarbons, and xanthophylls that contain one or more oxygen groups  <cit> . the carotenoid biosynthesis has been almost completely elucidated due to work in arabidopsis thaliana, rice, maize and in some ornamental plants  <cit> . briefly, the first stage of the biosynthetic process, mediated by phytoene synthase , involves the condensation of two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to produce phytoene, which normally does not accumulate in tissues . in higher plants, the phytoene undergoes a series of four desaturation reactions, mediated by phytoene desaturase , zeta-carotene isomerase , zeta-carotene desaturase  and carotenoid isomerase  that lead to the production of lycopene. double lycopene cyclization can produce α-carotene  or β-carotene . subsequent modifications transform α-carotene to zeinoxanthin and lutein, and the β-carotene to β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, violaxanthin and neoxanthin. the oxidative cleavage of violaxanthin and neoxanthin form xanthoxin, which is converted to the phytohormone abscisic acid via aba-aldehide  <cit> . strigolactones derive from β-carotenoids via a pathway involving the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases ccd <dig>  ccd <dig> and cyp711a <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the carotenoid metabolic/catabolic pathway 




wheat is one of the most important crops worldwide and is the leading source of plant protein in human food, having a higher protein content than other major cereals, such as maize or rice  <cit> . in addition to their protective role as antioxidant and as precursors of vitamin a, carotenoids are commercially important as they confer whiteness vs. yellowness degree to the end products of wheat. consumers usually prefer white bread made from common wheat , while yellow semolina and pasta made from durum wheat  are preferred by the market. flour and semolina colour is mainly the result of carotenoid accumulation in the grain  <cit> , but the final colour of end-finished products is also associated to losses during grain storage and to the carotenoid oxidative degradation by enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidase, lipoxygenase and peroxidase, during processing  <cit> .

flour and semolina colour in wheat is a quantitative trait controlled by several genes with additive effect, and influenced by environmental factors  <cit> . mapping studies for yellow pigment content  and yellow index , in several biparental populations have identified qtls on all wheat chromosomes . the major qtl on the long arm of chromosome 7a, accounting for up to 60% of the phenotypic variation, was detected through all studies and attributed to allelic variations of the phytoene synthase  gene . although there is an increased understanding of the mechanisms regulating carotenoid content and composition, only some carotenoid biosynthetic genes have been identified and cloned in wheat, such as phytoene synthase   <cit> , lycopene ε-cyclase   <cit> , carotene desaturase  and zeta-carotene desaturase   <cit> , carotenoid β–hydroxylase   <cit> , lycopene β-cyclase   <cit> .

as an alternative to classical linkage-based qtl mapping, the association mapping approach has received increased attention for detecting qtls controlling complex traits  <cit> . one of the potential disadvantages of genome-wide association studies  is the appearance of spurious marker-trait associations  resulting from population structure and multiple testing of thousands of markers  <cit> . association mapping can be simplified for some traits by the “candidate gene approach”, that is testing snps within a candidate gene for a significant association with the trait  <cit> .

the objectives of the current study were to: a) identify candidate carotenoid metabolic/catabolic genes in wheat by exploiting genomic resources and snps detected within the coding sequences of candidate genes; b) provide the precise map position of candidate genes on high-density snp-based consensus maps; c) identify the genetic loci controlling yellow pigments by gwas and candidate gene approaches using a tetraploid wheat collection coupled with the 90 k iselect snp genotyping array. the identification of genetic loci controlling yellow pigment accumulation/degradation will provide information on the genetic resources available to breeders to improve commercial and nutritional properties of wheat products, as well as the opportunity to develop functionally associated markers to be used in marker-assisted selection .

RESULTS
identification of carotenoid biosynthetic and catabolic genes of wheat
the a. thaliana isoprenoid pathways and respective genes from atipd  were used to identify and download the arabidopsis gene sequences from the tair database . in order to isolate the wheat carotenoid sequences, the  <dig> cdnas corresponding to all identified genes from a. thaliana database were used as query to extract sequences of t. aestivum and of the monocots brachypodium distachyon, o. sativa and zea mays . the in silico analysis highlighted a lack of uniformity for acronyms and gene names/classifications used in literature between different plant species . for simplicity, we used the gene nomenclature of a. thaliana, whose isoprenoid genes have been well characterized and reported in public metabolic pathway databases.table  <dig> genebank entries of the carotenoid metabolic/catabolic pathways genes of arabidopsis thaliana, triticum aestivum, brachypodium distachyon, oryza sativa and zea mays

the bootstrapped molecular phylogenetic tree , based on  <dig> carotenoid cdnas which correspond to orthologous sequences of the above-mentioned five plant species showed clear clustering of the orthologs by gene family. additionally this analysis showed that these carotenoid genes are generally highly conserved between species, with the minimum sequence similarity being between arabidopsis and brachypodium for nxs , and the maximum similarity observed between brachypodium and rice for cyp97c <dig> . sequence similarity helped to assign putative function to the identified wheat est sequences. table  <dig> lists the genebank entries of the carotenoid pathway genes of arabidopsis, brachypodium, rice, maize and wheat. the psy gene family is tightly clustered based on the three paralogous genes, annotated as psy <dig>  psy <dig> and psy <dig>  while in eudicots only the presence of psy <dig> and psy <dig> homologs have been reported  <cit> . the bch characterization present in literature  <cit>  was confirmed by the phylogenetic tree: ta_bch <dig> clustered with zm_bch <dig>  os_bch <dig> and bd_bch <dig>  while ta_bch <dig> gene grouped with os_bch <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the carotenoid metabolic/catabolic genes from arabidopsis thaliana, brachypodium disticum, zea mays, oryza sativa and triticum aestivum





the in silico gene expression analysis, using data from the publicly available wheat 61 k genechip, revealed variation in transcription patterns for these carotenoid genes in a wide range of tissues and developmental stages in wheat . exploiting the plexdb database, the expression data was investigated to predict the genes’ impact on the final carotenoid content. in general, all carotenoid genes were found to be expressed to some degree during all developmental stages, with minimum expression levels of  <dig>  and  <dig>  rma normalization for z-iso and ccd <dig>  respectively, and maximum levels of  <dig>  rma normalization for zds. in particular, psy <dig>  psy <dig>  pds, zds, lycb, cyp97c <dig>  ccd <dig>  vde, zep and nced <dig> showed elevated expression levels  in seedling leaf  while lyce, bch <dig> and bch <dig> genes exhibited high level of transcripts in anthers before anthesis . aao <dig> showed higher levels of expression in reproductive tissues including immature pistil before anthesis. aba <dig> showed the highest expression during the caryopsis-embryo-endosperm growth . low expression values  were detected for lyce in roots, cyp97c <dig> in anthers before anthesis, ccd <dig> in  <dig> dap endosperm stage and nxs in floral bracts before anthesis.

after the phylogenetic analysis, a blastn analysis  was performed between the  <dig> wheat carotenoid genes and the entire wheat snp dataset  <cit> , which provides a marker coverage of about 85% of the genome. a total of  <dig> snp markers corresponding to the  <dig> carotenoid gene sequences were identified, with several genes containing multiple snps . no snp markers were identified within the z-iso, ccd <dig>  ccd <dig>  cyp711a <dig> and nxs genes. twenty-two and  <dig> snp markers were located on the consensus durum  <cit>  and bread wheat maps  <cit> , respectively. this enabled us to assign genes to chromosomes groups; the crtiso genes were mapped on chromosome group 1; bch <dig> and vde on homoeologous chromosome arms 2 l; lcye on group 3; pds on group 4; psy <dig>  psy <dig>  ccd <dig> and aba <dig> on group 5; lut <dig> on group 6; psy <dig> and aao <dig> on chromosome arms 7 l.table  <dig> chromosome localization of the identified wheat carotenoid biosynthetic/catabolic genes on the durum  <cit>  and bread wheat  <cit>  consensus maps and allele frequency in the tetraploid wheat collection of  <dig> genotypes

phenotypic variation for yellow pigment content and yellow index
the tetraploid wheat collection, including  <dig> accessions of modern and old durum cultivars, durum landraces, domesticated and wild tetraploid wheat accessions, was evaluated for yellow index  in six environments, and for yellow pigment content  in two environments. the analysis of variance showed highly significant differences among genotypes in each environment; environments, genotypes and environment x genotype interaction were significant in the combined analysis across environments . mean, range, and heritability estimates  for ypc and yi of the whole collection, and of the durum wheat sub-population in each trial are reported in table  <dig>  a normal frequency distribution  was observed for both traits. mean values of yi of the whole collection varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , while mean values of the durum sub-population ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the phenotypic variation in the whole collection  and in the durum sub-population  suggested that alleles for low and high yi were present in the t. turgidum subset of the collection. ypc in the whole collection ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/g at f <dig>  and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/g at v <dig>  with average values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/g, respectively. the durum sub-population showed higher mean values than the whole collection. this would indicate that in recent decades durum wheat breeders have paid special attention to the selection of new cultivars with grain colour that will be of higher  value  <cit> .table  <dig> mean, range of variation, standard deviation , coefficient of variation  and heritability  in the whole collection and in the durum sub-population evaluated for yellow index  and yellow pigment content  in six and two environments, respectively

broad-sense heritability in the whole collection ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for yi, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for ypc. the high heritability values and the correlation coefficients among environments for yi and ypc  indicated that both traits were stable, and that the phenotypic expression was mainly due to genotypic effects. highly significant  and positive correlation  was observed between ypc and yi mean values across environments.table  <dig> regression analysis between carotenoid genes and yellow index and yellow pigment content in a tetraploid wheat collection evaluated in six and two environments, respectively

association of carotenoid genes to yellow pigments
out of  <dig> carotenoid candidate genes,  <dig> showed no snps in the coding sequences, failed in the array analysis, or had an allele frequency lower than  <dig>   in the wheat collection. these genes were therefore removed from the marker trait association  analysis. seven candidate genes  had between  <dig> to  <dig> snps, and a linear regression analysis was carried out between each snp, and ypc and yi . except for bch <dig> on 2bl, one or more snps of each candidate gene mapped onto one or both homeologous chromosomes were found to be significantly associated to yi, indicating their involvement in the yellow pigment biosynthesis or catabolism. psy <dig>  bch <dig>  cyp97a <dig>  vde and aba <dig> were also significantly associated to ypc. the phenotypic variation  explained by each of these markers varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for yi and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for ypc. the estimated allelic effects for each marker ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  units for yi, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/g for ypc.

detection of qtls by gwas
the wheat collection had been genotyped using the 90 k iselect array. after excluding snps on the basis described in the methods,  <dig>  snps in the whole collection and  <dig>  snps in the durum sub-population were used for the association analysis. all of these snps have locations on the durum consensus map  <cit> . mtas were initially calculated by linear regression analysis  and by three more statistical models  taking into account the confounding effects of population structure and relative kinship to minimize the occurrence of false-positive associations. in general, unsurprisingly the number of significant mtas with glm and glm + pcs was much higher than with mlm + k and mlm + k + pcs . the strong deviation of the observed -log <dig> values from the expected distribution  and the high number of significant mtas clearly indicated the detection of numerous false-positives by glm and glm + pcs models. observed p values were closer to expected distribution incorporating the k matrix only or the k matrix and the pcs into a mlm, providing more confidence in the associations for yi and ypc detected using this model. the mlm + k and mlm + k + pcs models gave similar results; to minimize possible false-positives we decided to focus on the results generated by the mlm + k + pcs model.

gwas based on mean values of yi across environments detected nine significant qtls in the whole collection, and five qtls in the durum sub-population . the qtls identified in the analysis of the whole population were on chromosomes 4a, 4b , 5b, 7a  and 7b. the qtls identified in the durum sub-population were on 4b  and 7a . four qtls  were identical in both analysis . out of nine significant qtls for yi across environments, the qtl on 7a at  <dig>  cm fulfilled the more stringent fdr criteria. the phenotypic variation  for each of these markers varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % in the whole collection and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % in the durum sub-population. the estimated allelic effects for each marker ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  units.table  <dig> snp markers significantly associated  ≥ 3) with yellow index identified by gwas  in the whole tetraploid wheat collection and in the durum sub-population evaluated in six environments

gwas based on mean values of ypc over two environments  detected three significant qtls on chromosomes 4b  and 7a  both in the whole collection and in the durum sub-population, and one additional qtl on 4b  in the durum sub-population. the qtl on 7a associated to the snp marker iwb <dig> located in the psy-a <dig> coding sequence was consistent in both the whole collection and the durum sub-population. out of four significant qtls for ypc across environments in the durum sub-population, the qtl on 7a at  <dig>  cm passed the fdr criteria. the phenotypic variation  explained for each of these markers varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, while the allelic effects for ypc ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/g.table  <dig> snp markers significantly associated  ≥ 3) with yellow pigment content identified by gwas  in the whole tetraploid wheat collection and in the durum sub-population evaluated in two environments

to investigate the environmental variations on detection of significant qtls by gwas, the mta analysis was carried out on the mean value over replicates for each of the six environments for yi and for each of the two environments for ypc . a high qtl-to-environment variation was observed for both traits as we identified  <dig> qtls specific in single environments vs. common qtls across environments. considering the gwas for yi in the whole collection, a minimum of  <dig> qtls were detected at v <dig> and a maximum of  <dig> qtls at v <dig>  eleven different qtls were only identified in one environment,  <dig> in two environments,  <dig> in three environments,  <dig> in four environments and only  <dig> in five environments. notably, no qtl was detected in all six environments. genotype x environment  interaction was lower in the durum sub-population:  <dig> qtls were detected in two environments,  <dig> in three environments,  <dig> in four environments and  <dig> in all six environments. the same trend was observed for ypc:  <dig> qtls were identified in only one environment and  <dig> in both examined environments in the whole collection; out of  <dig> qtls detected in the durum sub-population,  <dig> qtls were consistent in one environment and  <dig> in both environments.

discussion
identification and mapping of carotenoid genes in the wheat genome
the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway has been extensively studied in model plants and crop species due to their important roles in both development and photosynthesis  <cit> , and their beneficial effects on human health  <cit> . the wheat genome has still not been completely sequenced due to its huge size and complexity, and the knowledge of metabolic and catabolic pathway of carotenoid compounds remains incomplete.

comparative genomic analysis across different taxa allowed to transfer functional information from well-characterized model organisms, such as arabidopsis, rice and brachypodium, to another less-studied taxon, like wheat. this has been beneficial for bch <dig>  bch <dig>  cyp97c <dig>  ccd <dig>  ccd <dig>  nced <dig> and ccd <dig> genes, many of which have been well characterized in rice, brachypodium and arabidopsis, but few of which have been studied in wheat. all the orthologues clustered by gene on the phylogenetic tree, sharing common conserved motifs in cdna sequences. unsuprisingly, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the dicotyledonous psy <dig> and psy <dig> groups were more distantly related to those of the monocotyledonous groups, thus supporting the assumption that a single duplication event of the ancestor genes occurred before the divergence of the grass subfamilies  <cit> . differential duplication events took place in the bch clade. a separation of the arabidopsis bch paralogs suggested the same time frame as the other genes for functional diversification  <cit> , but an unexpected separation occurred prior to the main grass subfamily divergence for rice bch <dig>  further studies on the gene structure and intron-exon size facilitate a better understanding of the bch group. the in silico expression analysis of the carotenoid candidate genes included in the present study in a wide range of tissues and developmental stages showed that many of these genes had similar expression profiles. additionally we observed that sometimes one or more genes were virtually unexpressed  or highly expressed  in all the thirteen tissues/stages . lyce, bch <dig>  bch <dig>  cyp97a <dig> and aba genes exhibited high expression levels in the anthers prior to anthesis and in kernel tissues, indicating their potential involvement in kernel carotenoids accumulation.

with the objectives of both characterizing the carotenoid genes and investigating their relationships with the amber colour of grain and flour of wheat, we analyzed a tetraploid wheat collection with the recently developed genotyping array including  <dig>  gene-associated snps  <cit> . the blastn analysis of the entire snp dataset against the carotenoid gene sequences allowed to identifying 1– <dig> snps in the coding sequences of  <dig> out of  <dig> examined carotenoid candidate genes . in many cases, at least one snp was identified for each of the three homeologous genes present in the wheat genomes . the recent availability of the high-resolution consensus map of durum  <cit>  and common wheat  <cit>  allowed us to determine the precise map position of most of the carotenoid genes . the chromosomal location of  <dig> carotenoid genes determined by our strategy was consistent with results reported by crawford and francki   <cit> , who identified the chromosomal locations based on survey sequence from the international wheat genome sequencing consortium . map positions of a few carotenoid gene are reported in chromosome intervals as long as 5–20 cm in different ssr-based maps, such as psy <dig> and psy <dig>  <cit>  and lyce  <cit> . the carotenoid genes are distributed on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes of bread wheat, and the identification of functional markers and map position can be particularly useful for breeders in mas programs.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of wheat genome chromosomes. the map is a representation of a and b genome chromosomes of the durum consensus linkage map  <cit>  and of d chromosomes of the consensus bread wheat map  <cit> , with map positions of carotenoid candidate genes and qtls for yellow index and yellow pigment content. each chromosome map is represented by the first and the last snp marker, and by a snp marker every about 20 cm. ssr markers have been also inserted every about 20 cm to compare the consensus snp map with published ssr-based maps. markers are indicated on the right side and cm distances on the left side of the bar. solid regions of the chromosome bars indicate regions identified as being significantly associated with yi and ypc in published qtl biparental mapping populations . qtls are represented by bars on the right of each chromosome bar. qtl names indicate the trait  and the population in which the qtl was detected ; the closest snp marker is indicated in red. carotenoid genes are indicated after the corresponding snp located in the gene sequence  or in the same map position of the co-migrating snp marker located in the same contig




association of carotenoid genes to yellow pigments
the allele frequency of snp markers corresponding to carotenoid genes were found to be very variable in the examined wheat collection . several of these snps were either monomorphic, or had a maf < 10% and therefore considered to be rare alleles. psy <dig>  psy <dig>  bch <dig>  cyp97a <dig>  vde, aba <dig> and aao <dig> were significantly associated to ypc and yi , and this validated previous results obtained by using biparental mapping populations for psy <dig>  <cit> , lyce  <cit>  and aao <dig>  <cit> . the association of psy <dig>  bch <dig>  cyp97a <dig>  vde and aba <dig> genes with yi and ypc is novel, and indicated that the snp markers identified within the carotenoid gene sequences can represent a resource for developing genetic markers for use in marker assisted breeding.

ten carotenoid metabolic/catabolic genes were mapped in corresponding chromosome regions with qtls detected in the current work and/or in previous qtl studies  indicating possible relations between candidate genes and grain colour-related traits. six genes  are directly involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoid compounds  <cit> . interestingly, the catabolic genes nced <dig>  aba <dig> and aao <dig>  involved in the carotenoid cleavage to process violaxanthin and neoxanthin into abscisic acid, were located in chromosome regions influencing ypc . these data are consistent with findings in other plant species such as arabidopsis and maize  <cit> , demonstrating that carotenoid degradation is important in determining total carotenoid accumulation.

qtls detected by gwas and comparison with previous studies
in addition to the candidate gene approach, we conducted a gwas by using the glm and the mlm models taking into account the confounding effect of population structure and the relative kinship. q-q plots clearly indicated the mlm  as the most suitable model for the gwas of ypc and yi, thus confirming other results of gwas on quantitative traits carried out on crop plants  <cit> . several qtls for ypc and yi, distributed on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes of durum wheat, were detected . four stable qtls on 4b  and 7a  were associated with both yi and ypc, explaining the significant and positive correlation between the two colour-related traits found in the present and previous studies . the higher number of qtls for yi indicated that yellow pigments of wheat kernels are synthesized by different biochemical pathways, including that for the carotenoids, which interact in some way with the accumulation of carotenoids, such as polyphenol oxidase , lipoxygenase  and other carotenoid oxidative enzymes  <cit> . in addition, it is possible that the wider variability of the entire wheat collection is determined by more genes influencing colour-related traits, and that some yellow pigment genes have been fixed during the breeding programs for grain colour improvement and therefore not detected in the durum sub-population.

several studies on qtl mapping of yellow pigments in wheat have been published during the past two decades. a detailed list of qtls detected in  <dig> peer-reviewed papers is reported in additional file 1: table s <dig> and the majority of them are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  except chromosome 1d, qtls for yellow pigments were detected on all wheat chromosomes. results of qtl mapping studies indicated many differences in the number and map position of qtls detected in the different experiments. this may be attributed to a high number of effective genes underlying qtls coupled with: a) different contributions from parental genotypes of mapping populations; b) qtl x environment interactions; c) differences in the carotenoid extraction procedures and colour measurement, therefore different gene-to-trait associations revealed; d) marker density of linkage maps used in qtl analyses; e) differences in the statistical procedures used for qtl detection and threshold used for the statistical significance of mtas.

while many of the qtls for yi and ypc identified in the current study had been described previously ,  <dig> qtls detected on 1as, 2al, 2bs, 3bl , 4bs, 5as, 5bs  and 7as  were new. four of these qtls were detected in more than one environment , indicating that some wheat accessions of the examined collection possess new stable alleles potentially useful for improving colour and nutritional value of wheat grain. additionally  <dig> qtls detected in the present study , 3bs, 4al, 4bs, 5al, 5bl, 6al , 7al , 7bl ) validated qtls previously detected in different genetic backgrounds. therefore these qtls can be considered as stable and useful for mas in breeding programs.

genotype x environment interaction and qtl detection
with the aim to investigate if the results of gwas were affected by environmental fluctuations, we conducted replicated trials for yi and ypc in six and two environments, respectively. comparing the gwas results, large variations in the number and type of qtls were observed for both traits in different environments, thus confirming the existence of genotype x environment interaction effects as indicated by the variance analysis. stable associations for yi in at least three over six environments in the whole collection were detected for five qtls corresponding to one genomic region on chromosomes 5b, and four regions on 7a. in many cases, the snp-trait associations were environment-specific, as  <dig> qtls were consistent only in one environment and  <dig> in two environments. the same trend was observed for ypc evaluated in two environments. although the high values of heritability  in open field trials, the complexity of the genetic basis of the studied traits tends to confound the interpretation of gwas results. these findings are consistent with results obtained by association mapping and qtl linkage analyses experiments on complex traits with far lower heritability such as yield and yield components  <cit> . the present study suggests that qtl analysis for agronomically important “true” quantitative traits should be always conducted in a plurality of environments with different soil and climatic conditions. finally, the need to evaluate and take into account the g x e interaction is important in breeding programs to identify genotypes adapted in a wide range of environments.

comparison between simple regression and mlm analysis for qtl detection
the snps located in the gene sequences psy <dig>  psy <dig>  bch <dig>  cyp97a <dig>  vde and aba <dig> were significantly associated to yi and ypc by regression analysis but not by gwas analysis. only the snp marker iwb <dig> located in the coding sequence of the abscisic aldehyde oxidase  on chromosome arm 7al was consistent by both mta analyses. the psy <dig>  psy <dig>  cyp97a <dig> and vde genes were mapped on chromosome regions corresponding to qtls for yi and ypc detected in the current study by gwas or by previous studies using biparental mapping populations . nced, crtiso and lyce, which were excluded from the regression analysis as they had allele frequencies lower than  <dig> , were also mapped in chromosome regions corresponding to qtls for yi and ypc. the same results were obtained by zhao  <cit> , who detected several snps near height-controlling genes consistent only by the naïve approach, and suggested that mapping populations derived from crosses between genetically distant parents could be needed to complement gwas to reduce the rate of both false positives and false negatives. it is well known that gwas carried out by the glm model generally gives a high number of false-positives  <cit> , and that it is necessary to take into account the confounding effect of population structure and relatedness among individual to control the overall probability of type i error  <cit> . however, reducing the number of false positives may lead to increasing the number of false negatives, and in some situation ignoring most of the important findings on the genetics and physiology of the traits of interest  <cit> . the combination of population genetic models and molecular biological knowledge into new qtl detection methods has been recently proposed to increase statistical power of gwas in human and agricultural research, as to reduce the overall probability of type ii error , and incorporate biological context in gwas results  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
gwas analysis in wheat collections can contribute to validate qtls previously detected in biparental populations and to unravel new qtls for colour-related traits. the mlm models can reduce the number of false positives, while the candidate gene approach can contribute to reduce the number of false negatives. however, gwas analysis should be carried out on phenotypic data measured in more environments to detecting stable qtls and determining the genotype x environment interactions that tend to confound the interpretation of mtas and the genetic dissection even of quantitative traits with high heritability values. the availability of markers within the coding sequences of candidate genes can allow to elucidating the mechanism of carotenoid accumulation in the wheat kernels and to exploiting the genetic variability of colour-related traits for the nutritional and commercial improvement of end-finished products of wheat.
