BACKGROUND
mirnas, small endogenous non-coding rnas approximately 21– <dig> nucleotides  in length, play an important role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . a large number of mirnas have recently been identified in plants, and numerous mirnas have been entered into the mirbase. mirnas are involved in regulating growth, development, hormone balance, floral morphogenesis, reproductive performance, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. upon nutritional deficiency, mirnas regulate the metabolic balance of phosphorus, sulphur and copper in plants . under environmental stresses, including drought, flooding, salt, cold and heat, stress-regulated mirnas in plants confer resistance to the extreme conditions  <cit> . in addition, the expression of mirnas can alter in plants in response to biotic stresses, such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, or insects .

the genome of p. trichocarpa is small, and these plants reach reproductive maturity in a relatively short time  <cit> . thus, populus is a useful forest species model for genetic and ecological research. in recent years, studies on populus mirnas have increased , particularly the expression of mirnas and the function of the targets in response to abiotic stresses, including cold, heat, drought, flooding, high salt and mechanical stress . a larger number of serious diseases occur in poplar, particularly foliar rust disease induced through infections with the rust fungus melampsora spp., which markedly affects the growth of seeding and saplings. however, few studies have focused on mirna expression profiling in the response of poplars to biotic stress, particularly pathogen stress  <cit> .

to understand the roles of mirnas in the response of poplars to pathogenic fungi, we constructed three libraries from uninfected p. szechuanica leaves  and leaves infected with avirulent and virulent isolates of m. larici-populina, detected the expression of mirnas through high-throughput sequencing and analysed the target genes. qrt-pcr was used to analyse the expression of ten mirnas in plants inoculated for different times. the results of the present study help elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of populus in response to foliar rust fungal infections.

RESULTS
analysis of mirna sequences
using solexa sequencing, we constructed three libraries from uninoculated p. szechuanica leaves  and leaves inoculated with avirulent  and virulent  isolates of m. larici-populina. a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from sb <dig>  th <dig> and control libraries, respectively . after eliminating low-quality reads and impurities,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads were obtained from the three libraries. after discarding 3’ adapter deletions, insertion deletions, 5’ adapter contaminants, poly-a sequences and sequences less than 18 nt from the high-quality reads,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were used for further analysis. the proportions of clean reads were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total reads obtained from the three libraries, respectively.table  <dig> summary of small-rna sequencing data in three p. szechuanica libraries



the small rna  reads were typically  <dig> to 25 nt in length . among these sequences, 21 nt srnas were the most abundant in the three libraries, accounting for  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  %  of the total reads, followed by 24 nt srnas, which accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total reads, respectively. these results were consistent with previous studies in populus  <cit> . however, it was also reported that the most abundant reads length was 24 nt, followed by 21 nt  <cit> , indicating that the mirnas in populus are primarily  <dig> and 24 nt in length. furthermore, we observed that the number of 21 nt sequences in the control libraries was more abundant than that in the treatment libraries, and the number of 24 nt sequences in the treatment libraries was more abundant than that in the control libraries. the results suggest that the number of 21 nt mirna sequences decreased and the number of 24 nt mirna sequences increased in p. szechuanica after infection with foliar rust fungus.fig.  <dig> length, distribution and frequency of srnas in the three p. szechuanica libraries



more than ten million total srna sequences and nearly three million unique srna sequences were identified . obviously, the srna sequences in the three libraries were sufficiently abundant to provide adequate data for further analysis. unannotated sequences accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total clean reads and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the unique reads in sb <dig>  th <dig> and control libraries, respectively. thus, unknown sequences accounted for substantial proportions of the rna categories in each library.table  <dig> distribution of srnas in different categories in three libraries of p. szechuanica

known mirnas in p. szechuanica
known mirnas in p. szechuanica infected with m. larici-populina were identified through homologous alignment analysis using the plant mirna in mirbase  <dig> . a total of  <dig> known mirnas were obtained in the sb <dig>  th <dig> and control libraries, belonging to  <dig> families from  <dig> genomic loci . the percentages of dominant mirna families are shown in fig. 2a, and most of these mirnas were largely conserved in various plant species, except mir <dig>  which was only identified in p. trichocarpa. the expression levels of a few mirna families, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were obviously high in three libraries. the most abundant mirna family was mir <dig>  accounting for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total sequences in sb <dig>  th <dig> and control libraries, respectively.fig.  <dig> abundance of highly expressed mirnas in the three p. szechuanica libraries.

mirnas have a broad range of expression, varying from several to millions of reads. for example, mir <dig> generated  <dig> , <dig> reads, whereas mir <dig> generated only  <dig> reads in the control library. most of the conserved mirnas were identified from the three libraries, and certain mirnas were abundant in some samples but scarce or even lacking in other samples. for example, the expression of mir <dig> in sb <dig> and th <dig> libraries generated  <dig> and  <dig> reads, respectively; however, this mirna was not present in the control library. similarly, although the expression of mir <dig> generated  <dig> reads in the control library, this mirna generated no reads in the other two libraries. moreover, the number of reads for different members of same family varied widely. for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> both belong to the mir <dig> family; however,  <dig>  reads were obtained for mir <dig>  whereas only  <dig> reads were obtained for mir <dig> in the control library.

a total of  <dig> mirnas were common to the three libraries examined. three mirnas  were only identified in the sb <dig> library, whereas four mirnas  were specific to the th <dig> library .fig.  <dig> venn diagrams of the mirnas identified in the three libraries. a known mirnas. b novel mirnas



novel mirnas in p. szechuanica
the unique difference between mirna and other small-molecule rnas is that mirna precursors form stem-loop structures as the basis for the prediction of new mirna. in the present study,  <dig> novel mirnas from  <dig> genome loci were identified using mireap software , shenzhen, china) . the precursor sequences and predicted secondary structures of  <dig> novel mirnas are shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  a total of  <dig> mirnas were generated from multiple loci, among which novel_mir_ <dig> had  <dig> loci. marked differences in the abundance of the novel mirnas were also observed. the percentages of highly expressed novel mirnas are shown in fig. 2b. the most abundant mirna was novel_mir_ <dig>  with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads corresponding to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total reads in the sb <dig>  th <dig> and control libraries, respectively, followed by novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig>  as shown in fig. 3b,  <dig> novel mirnas were common to the three libraries, whereas  <dig> mirnas were unique to the sb <dig> library and  <dig> mirnas were only identified in the th <dig> library.

differential expression of mirnas within inoculation treatments
the analysis of the differential expression of mirnas in the inoculated and control libraries showed that  <dig> mirnas  were up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas  were down-regulated in p. szechuanica infected with sb <dig>  whereas  <dig> mirnas  were up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas  were down-regulated in p. szechuanica infected with th <dig>  the comparison of the mirna expression levels in p. szechuanica inoculated with sb <dig> and th <dig> showed that  <dig> known  and  <dig> novel mirnas  were differentially expressed between the two libraries. in brief, we identified  <dig> known and  <dig> novel differentially expressed mirnas from the three libraries that might play important roles in response to pathogen stress . among these mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> were suppressed or down-regulated, while mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> were up-regulated in both sb <dig> and th <dig> libraries compared to the control library. the expression level of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> were down-regulated in the sb <dig> library, but their sequencing reads did not vary significantly in the th <dig> library. in contrast, expression levels of novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> were up-regulated in the sb <dig> library, but these mirnas were not expressed in either the th <dig> or the control library. the expression levels of mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> did not vary significantly in the sb <dig> library, however, in the th <dig> library, they were suppressed. in conclusion, the expressions levels of the same mirnas were significantly different, and the expression levels of poplar mirnas were more suppressed during rust infection.

target prediction and functional analysis
the majority of plant mirnas were completely complementary with their targets, which provided a convenient starting point for the prediction of target genes. a large number of targets were predicted for most mirnas using the program developed by bgi  and obeying the criteria and methods outlined previously  <cit> . the results of kegg pathway analysis revealed that target genes of these mirnas were involved in various biological and biochemical processes in plant growth and development. the top ten preferential pathways of the target genes in the three p. szechuanica libraries were shown in fig.  <dig>  as for the known mirnas, the pathway that accounted for the largest percentage of the total targets was metabolic pathways, followed by plant-pathogen interaction . however, regarding novel mirnas, the pathway with the highest proportion of target genes was plant-pathogen interaction. metabolic pathways took second place . differentially expressed mirnas and their target gene functional annotations were list in additional file 4: table s <dig>  among these mirnas, twenty-seven mirnas including  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas in the leaves of p. szechuanica infected with m. larici-populina, were analysed and the results showed that the target genes were primarily associated with disease-resistance proteins, serine/threonine protein kinases, transcription factors, and related proteins . the genes of disease resistance proteins rps <dig>  rps <dig> and rpm <dig> were putative targeted by  <dig> known mirnas  and  <dig> novel mirnas . lrr receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase  was predicted to be only targeted by several novel mirnas, novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  two transcription factors involving in plant defense responses, transcription factor wrky and myc <dig>  were found to be targeted by novel_mir_ <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively. in addition, polyphenol oxidase, l-ascorbate oxidase and peroxidase genes were also predicted to be targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig>  respectively. meanwhile, we also observed that some mirnas have identical and unique targets; for example, the targets of the mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> were all disease-resistance proteins, whereas some mirnas, such as mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> have multiple target genes and functional annotations, including the genes of various enzymes, disease-resistance proteins and transcription factors.fig.  <dig> top ten preferential pathways from kegg pathway analysis of the target genes in the three p. szechuanica libraries. a known mirnas. b novel mirnas. x-axis represents the percentages of target genes involved in the ten pathways accounting for the total targets



qrt-pcr validation of p. szechuanica mirnas
to confirm the temporal dynamic expression of mirnas involved in pathogen stress, we further analysed  <dig> mirnas in p. szechuanica infected with m. larici-populina at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi using qrt-pcr. the results showed that the mirna expression levels dramatically changed during the pathogenesis of foliar rust infection . when plants were infected with sb <dig>  the mirna expression levels exhibited three patterns: pattern a, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  and novel_mir <dig>  gradually increased at the early stage, peaked at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi and then gradually declined; pattern b, including mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig>  initially increased, then decreased, and subsequently increased again, peaking at  <dig> hpi; pattern c, including mir <dig> and mir <dig>  initially decreased, then increased, peaking at  <dig> hpi, and subsequently declined again. when plants were infected with th <dig>  the mirna expression levels were classified into four patterns. the first three patterns were identical to those observed with sb052: pattern a included mir <dig> and novel_mir_161; pattern b included mir <dig>  mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig>  whose expression markedly declined, reaching the lowest point at  <dig> hpi; and pattern c only included novel_mir_ <dig>  pattern d, including mir <dig>  mir <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig>  suddenly increased, peaking at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi, followed by a dramatic decline. in the present study, the sequencing results showed that novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig> were only observed in the th <dig> library or in both the th <dig> library and control, respectively; however, these mirnas could be detected in the sb <dig> library using qrt-pcr analysis. these different results suggest that deep sequencing was not sufficient for the detection of the expression of all mirnas. interestingly, we observed that the expression of  <dig> mirnas, except mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig>  increased at  <dig> hpi in the sb <dig> library and decreased at  <dig> hpi in the th <dig> library compared with expression levels at  <dig> hpi, indicating that the expression levels of the same mirnas differed in incompatible and compatible interaction libraries.fig.  <dig> temporal dynamic expression of mirnas in p. szechuanica infected with m. larici-populina at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi. when plants were infected with sb <dig>  the validated mirnas were classified into expression patterns a, b and c. when plants were infected with th <dig> , the validated mirnas were classified into expression patterns a, b, c and d. for normalization,  <dig> s rrna was selected as a reference gene, and the expression level at  <dig> hpi  was set to  <dig>  the statistical analyses and graphics were generated using the sigmaplot  <dig>  statistical package



discussion
identification of mirnas in p. szechuanica
several studies concerning mirna expression in populus subjected to various stresses have recently been conducted, and the number of mirnas identified in populus is increasing. a total of  <dig> mature populus mirna sequences have been registered in mirbase  <dig> , among which  <dig> mirnas have been identified in p. trichocarpa and  <dig> mirnas have been identified in p. euphratica. however, there are few studies concerning the expression of mirnas under pathogen stress in populus. in the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing to construct libraries from the uninfected leaves of p. szechuanica and leaves infected with m. larici-populina avirulent isolate sb <dig> and virulent isolate th <dig>  sequencing obtained  <dig> known mirnas belong to  <dig> families  and  <dig> novel mirnas . the known mirnas were matched with mirbase  <dig> , and  <dig> mirnas were identified in populus, of which  <dig> mirnas were p. trichocarpa mirnas and  <dig> mirnas were specific to p. euphratica. the remaining mirnas were conserved in other plant species. among the conserved mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig> families were the most abundant, similar to their expression levels in p. euphratica  <cit> , p. tomentosa  <cit>  and p. beijingensis  <cit> , whereas novel mirnas showed low expression levels compared with the known mirnas in p. szechuanica. a majority of known mirnas were common to the three libraries, but most of novel mirnas were only identified in a certain libraries . these results showed that the unique mirnas in p. szechuanica were abundant and their expression levels were altered by m. larici-populina infection.

expression and targets function of mirnas under pathogen stress
in the present study,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas were identified in p. szechuanica infected with sb <dig>  whereas  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas were identified in plants infected with th <dig>  these findings revealed that more mirnas were suppressed during rust infection. among these mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly down-regulated upon rust fungus infection, consistent with the role of these mirnas as negative regulators of disease-resistance proteins  <cit> . whereas previously reported expression levels of mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit>  were contrary to the results obtained in the present study. this differential expression might reflect different mirna functions in different poplar-pathogen interactions or different inoculation tissues and durations, suggesting that mirnas have complex regulatory functions in plants subjected to biotic stresses.

according to the functional analysis of the target genes by kegg pathway database, the high-expressed known mirnas were mostly responsible for controlling the basic metabolism pathways, while the low-expressed novel mirnas were mainly involved in regulating the plant-pathogen interaction . we can see that plant-pathogen interaction and metabolic pathways were significantly over-represented in poplar upon rust fungal inoculation.

mirnas and their target genes have multiple functions in different plant species. mir <dig> was highly conserved and involved in various stresses. it target genes encoded the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat  disease resistance protein  <cit>  and squamosa promoter-binding protein , known to regulate plant development and growth  <cit> . however, in our trial, mir <dig> had  <dig> targets, among which  <dig> targets were predicted that encoded ubiquitin c, which is involved in dna repair, translational control and signal transmission. the differentially expressed mirnas and the functions of their target genes were shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  the expression of mir <dig> was up-regulated in p. beijingensis  <cit>  and p. trichocarpa  <cit>  inoculated with canker disease pathogen as well as p. szechuanica inoculated with virulent isolate th <dig>  four target genes of mir <dig> encoded argonaute  which is closely involved in the biosynthesis and function of mirna. ago <dig> mrna is involved in a negative feedback regulation through the action of mir <dig>  <cit> . previous reports of the expression of mir <dig>  <cit>  and mir <dig>  <cit>  were contrary to the results obtained in the present study. mir <dig> predicted  <dig> targets encoding auxin response factor , which is involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathway  <cit> . auxin signal transduction is related to bacterial disease resistance in arabidopsis  <cit> , and fungal disease resistance in p. trichocarpa  <cit> . one target of mir <dig> encoded apetala <dig>  which is involved in floral development in many plant species under different stresses  <cit>  and another target gene in loblolly pine infected with fusiform rust encoded an lrr protein kinase  <cit> . in addition, the target functions of several mirnas were unknown and the targets of some mirnas have not been predicted.

to uncover the functions of mirnas in p. szechuanica under rust fungus-induced stress, the mirna target genes involved in disease resistance were annotated using the kegg pathway database . mir <dig> expression was down-regulated in the sb <dig> library. the target gene of mir <dig> encoded polyphenol oxidase, which is an important enzyme for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the over-expression of polyphenol oxidase in tomato enhanced resistance to the pathogen pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . similarly, expressions of mir <dig> were obviously down-regulated in the incompatible interaction. the target gene l-ascorbate oxidase influenced tobacco growth and defense responses by modulating redox state of the apoplastic ascorbic acid  <cit> . the expression of mir <dig> was down-regulated in the sb <dig> library but up-regulated in the th <dig> library, and the target genes of mir <dig> encoded the transcription factor myc <dig>  a member of the plant-pathogen interaction pathway, and 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, involved in the defence response of poplars to m. larici-populina  <cit> . the target genes of  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas encoded disease resistance proteins, including rpm <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig>  these targets all belong to the largest class of disease resistance proteins, the nbs-lrr class, which confer resistance to bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens . the arabidopsis thaliana rpm <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> genes confer resistance to the bacterial pathogen p. syringae . in previous studies, the target genes of mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit>  and mir <dig>  <cit>  were also found to encode disease-resistance proteins. these findings imply that these mirnas are responsive to disease stress in different plants and play similar roles in resistance to pathogen infections.

the results of the qrt-pcr analysis demonstrated that most mirnas in p. szechuanica infected with the avirulent isolate sb <dig> and virulent isolate th <dig> were up-regulated and down-regulated at  <dig> hpi, respectively. mir <dig> is important in plants under biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the expression of mir <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi was lower than that at other times in compatible interactions; however, mir <dig> expression reached high levels at the same times in incompatible interactions. in previous studies, many mirnas were suppressed during fungus infection in compatible interactions, whereas most mirnas did not vary with respect to incompatible interactions  <cit>  or the number of down-regulated mirnas was slightly less than that observed in compatible interactions  <cit> . rinaldi et al.  <cit>  elucidated that a great number of transcripts were significantly differentially regulated in incompatible interactions, but almost no transcriptional changes were detected in compatible interactions at  <dig> hpi. these findings provide us with evidence that 48hpi is a vital period for poplar-rust fungus interactions, and related genes are expressed differentially. according to these results, we speculate that mirnas could possibly regulate the expression of certain genes and, through the changing expression of mirnas, could play vital roles in regulating disease-resistance in populus infected with rust. furthermore, a significant difference exists between compatible and incompatible interactions at 48hpi. therefore, the regulated functions of mirnas in p. szechuanica infected with virulent and avirulent rust isolates at  <dig> hpi are complex, and require further investigation to understand the molecular mechanism of poplar-rust interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified from p. szechuanica infected with the m. larici-populina incompatible isolate sb <dig>  the m. larici-populina compatible isolate th <dig> and uninfected controls through high-throughput sequencing. comparative analysis revealed that the expression of mirnas was significantly different after infection with different rust isolates, and more mirnas were suppressed during rust infection. the targets of  <dig> mirnas were primarily associated with disease resistance. the qrt-pcr analysis showed that mirna expression exhibited different temporal dynamics in incompatible and compatible libraries. the regulatory mechanism of poplar mirnas in response to rust fungus infection should be further studied.
