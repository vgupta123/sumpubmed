BACKGROUND
the history of fruit tree domestication is strongly linked to grafting, which provided an easy technique for clonal reproduction of trees with desirable properties that are difficult to propagate vegetatively. it is generally accepted that the domestication of several fruit trees such as apple, plum and others was not possible without the development of the grafting technique  <cit> . in addition to being useful or necessary for propagation, rootstocks can influence the size of scions and increase their vigor. physiological investigation of the interactions between scions and rootstocks in grapevine showed that grafting can reduce the toxic effects of salinity by the ability of the rootstock to limit the uptake of na+ and cl− ions by the scion  <cit> . in several crop species, e.g., in peach  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit> , rootstocks have been shown to reduce leaf chlorosis caused by iron deficiency. rootstocks also have been selected to increase tree tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought and soil ph  <cit> , and increase the resistance against soil pathogens  <cit> .

genetic comparison of suckers and the canopy of old olive trees in the iberian peninsula  <cit>  and the southeast mediterranean area  <cit>  provide strong evidence for grafting as a common practice in olive cultivation in the past  <cit> . diez et al. suggested that by grafting of scions on wild growing trees, natural populations of olea europaea subsp. europaea var. sylvestris were transformed into olive groves  <cit> , and the use of individual ‘wild’ olive trees as vigorous rootstocks in traditional olive cultivation has also been suggested  <cit> . however, evidence on the potential contribution of the rootstock to olive tree fitness and phenotypic properties is very limited and is based on recent experimental systems using combinations of known cultivars . in these experiments, particular combinations of rootstocks and scions were shown to decrease the harmful effects of excessive boron concentrations in the soil  <cit> , and to increase resistance to verticillium wilt  <cit> .

previously we reported that most old olive trees in the southeast mediterranean area are grafted. in addition, a multi-locus lineage  analysis had shown that most of the scions  belong to a single mll , presumably representing the souri cultivar, and that most of the rootstocks probably originated from plant individuals resulting from sexual reproduction  <cit> . however, we also identified an mll  that was more common than other mlls in rootstocks of grafted old olive trees and was present in 23% of the trees analysed  <cit> . this led to the hypothesis that olive cultivation in the region may have involved selection not only of a specific scion but also of a specific rootstock. traditional olive groves in the southeast mediterranean area are distributed along a geographic gradient of diverse climatic, topographic and edaphic conditions  <cit> . as rootstocks might have been selected for improvement of the root system in stressful conditions and/or for their influence on phenotypic properties of the scion, we aimed to investigate the contribution of the most common rootstock  to the fitness and phenotype of olive trees in different environments. we here use a model selection procedure based on the akaike information criterion  to investigate the potential advantage of the mll1/mll <dig> combination by quantifying the impact of a number of environmental variables on several agriculturally important phenotypic traits.

methods
in our previous study  <cit>  we reported on a total of  <dig> old olive trees in which both suckers and scions were collected from the same trees and genotyped. identification of scion and rootstock mlls was performed with leaf samples taken from tree canopies  and from suckers that developed from the trunk base  <cit> . thus, a comparison between scion and sucker of the same tree enabled us to differentiate between three genetic groups : 1) gg <dig> included trees in which the common souri cultivar  was grafted on mll <dig> ; 2) gg <dig>  in which both suckers and scions were assigned to mll <dig> ; and 3) gg <dig> included those trees in which the common souri cultivar was grafted on single-occurrence rootstock mlls that probably originated from sexual reproduction . trees of the second group  were either the result of vegetative propagation of mll <dig> or of grafting of mll <dig> scions on mll <dig> truncheons. the analysis included a total of  <dig> old olive trees from  <dig> groves with various environmental conditions in the southeast mediterranean area.

phenotypic characterization
fruits were collected during the harvest in a single season in  <dig> and were used for morphological evaluation, oil extraction and evaluation of content and quality of the oil. morphological evaluation included the weight and dimension of  <dig> fruits and stones of each tree. the abencor system  was used to extract oil from 1 kg of fruits of each of the investigated trees  <cit> , and the relative content of oil and paste water was determined after soxhlet chemical extraction as previously described  <cit> . fatty acid  profiles were determined following  <cit> , and the ratio between monounsaturated fatty acids  and polyunsaturated fatty acids  was determined. following ben-gal et al.  <cit> , the peroxide value , acidity  and total content of polyphenols  in the oil were also determined.

environmental parameters
average annual rainfall and elevation data were gathered from the geographic information system center database  using the lati-/longitudinal coordinates of groves. daily temperatures for  <dig> were collected using the modis remote sensing of surface and canopy temperatures ; t
max and t
min were calculated according to blum et al.  <cit>  and used to determine the number of growing degree days  during the period from first flowering to fruit harvest , following the equation tmax+tmin2-tbase   <cit> ). calcium carbonate content in the soil was used to assess edaphic conditions, as calcareous soil is one of the limiting factors of agricultural practice in the region  <cit> . soil samples, five in each grove, were collected from three soil depths , and soil analysis was conducted by the gilat extension services laboratory and research center ; the results are presented as the average value of the three layers analysed .

statistical analysis
linear regression was used to examine the abundance of trees belonging to the two scion/sucker combinations mll1/mll <dig>  vs. mll1/mll <dig>  along gradients of environmental conditions. linear models were also used to examine which environmental factors explain phenotypic variation. to evaluate the environmental effects, we used a model selection procedure based on the akaike information criterion , corrected for small sample sizes  <cit> . models where the given trait  was explained using all possible combinations of environmental factors , genetic groups  and the interactions of each environmental factor with genetic groups were evaluated based on aic. old olive trees belonging to gg <dig> were not included in the aic analysis as they do not represent a genetically homogenous group. the aic analysis thus included a total of  <dig> trees. factors present in the most parsimonious model  and their direction of influence were then summarized. the inclusion of interaction terms enabled us to understand whether the genetic groups  differ in their response to the different environmental factors . all statistical analyses were done using r  <cit> .

RESULTS
the abundance of olive trees with different genotype combinations in groves along environmental gradients
traditional rain-fed olive groves in the southeast mediterranean area are scattered through geographical districts that vary in climatic conditions and soil texture and chemistry. for this study, olive groves were selected to represent an aridity gradient from north to south, ranging from relatively mesic mediterranean climate sites  to semi-arid  and arid conditions with less than <350 mm rainfall per year  . we included groves of relatively high elevation in the samaria and judean mts.  to lower elevation in the inner plain , the carmel and the coastal plain . variation in the average annual maximum and minimum temperatures  was also found among sites. the range of caco <dig> content in the soil  represents the variability of edaphic conditions in the region . linear regression did not show any significant correlation between any of the environmental parameters .table  <dig> environmental data of the investigated groves arranged along an aridity gradient; gdd data for ash is missing

mapping the relative number of trees of all three mll combinations in the investigated groves showed that trees of the mll1/mll <dig> combination  are more abundant in the northern  and central parts  of the cultivation area of olives in the southeast mediterranean area . the linear regression showed a significant association between average rainfall and the proportion of trees belonging to gg <dig>  and those of gg <dig> , but this proportion was not associated with any of the other environmental parameters considered, i.e. gdd, elevation  and the relative content of caco <dig> in the soil . as expected when estimating the effect of single environmental factor in ecological studies, the significant association between average rainfall and the proportion of gg <dig> and gg <dig> trees  suggests that other unknown environmental factor contribute to the abundance of these two mll combinations along the aridity gradient. nevertheless, the abundance of trees of gg <dig> was higher at more mesic locations, while the proportion of trees belonging to gg <dig> increased with increasing aridity .table  <dig> linear regression between environmental parameters and the relative number of old olive trees belonging to gg <dig> and gg2

testing the potential contribution of genotype combination to tree phenotype
anova post hoc tests did not show significant differences between trees belonging to the gg <dig> and gg <dig> combinations in any of the eight phenotypic traits measured . when taking into account environmental effects and genetic group in the aic model selection procedure, the content of paste water in the fruit, the peroxide value and stone length were positively associated with grafting, while the ratio of mufa/pufa and stone width were negatively influenced by grafting of mll <dig> on mll <dig> . note that the use of positive or negative ‘influence’ or ‘effect’ refers to their statistical term in the model, and thus does not necessarily reflect beneficial  or detrimental  effects. our results further showed that the environmental parameters influenced most of the fruit traits of gg <dig> and gg <dig> trees in a similar way . exceptions to this were the positive effects of elevation and caco <dig> content on paste water and peroxide value in trees of gg <dig>  respectively, and the negative effects of these environmental parameters on these traits in trees of gg <dig>  oil content and fruit and stone dimension and weight were positively influenced by average rainfall in both gg <dig> and gg <dig> trees. similar negative effects of average rainfall were found in acidity and paste water content, while the average rainfall did not have any effect on the other oil quality characters in the two groups of trees . elevation had a stronger effect on mufa/pufa in trees of the gg <dig> combination than in those belonging to gg <dig> and on peroxide values in gg <dig> trees than in trees of gg <dig>  similarly, caco <dig> had a stronger influence on stone weight in gg <dig> trees and on stone length in trees belonging to gg <dig>  gdd had a positive effect on peroxide values in both groups of trees, but its effect was more pronounced in trees of gg <dig>  in addition, the negative effect of gdd on stone weight was stronger in trees belonging to gg <dig> than in those belonging to gg <dig>  the adjusted r
 <dig> values of the aic model showed the lowest value for total concentration of polyphenols  and the highest for peroxide value  and stone weight  .table  <dig> predicted direction of influence for the effects of environmental variables on the phenotypic traits of the investigated trees belonging to gg <dig> and gg2; model summaries are provided in additional file 3


positive and negative association is given by the coefficients of the most parsimonious model  for the given trait as either positive , negative  or zero . interaction between genotype combination and environmental effects is indicated by the differences between the two columns for a given environmental variable. for example, the effect of caco <dig> on peroxide value is positive in gg <dig> but negative in gg <dig> due to the presence of an interaction term in the final model

discussion
old olive trees in the southeast mediterranean area that belong to the common souri cultivar have rootstocks of different genotype . our previous results indicated that 23% of the rootstocks belong to one multi-locus lineage   <cit> . mapping of the trees in which the local mll <dig> variety is grafted on the common mll <dig> , and those in which scion and suckers both belong to mll <dig>  showed that the first group of trees  are more abundant in the northern and central parts of the olive cultivation area in the region . in addition, the linear regression analysis indicated a significant association between the relative number of gg <dig> trees at each grove and the average annual precipitation . thus, old olive trees growing in groves with different environmental conditions , but with the same mll in their fruit bearing part  and with rootstocks belonging to either mll <dig> or mll <dig>  offer an opportunity to examine the possible contribution of the rootstock to traits of the crop, which more commonly is studied in common garden experiments.

our sampling included trees growing in a range of soils that vary in their caco <dig> content  . it has been suggested that grafting of olives is recommended for growing trees in problematic soils, such as soils with high caco <dig> contents or saline soils  <cit> . we thus hypothesized that grafting on the specific mll <dig> can provide an advantage in the calcareous soils of the region, where soil ph is high and availability of water and micronutrients is limited  <cit> . supporting this hypothesis, the aic model selection procedure showed differential positive and negative responses of peroxide values to the effect of caco <dig> in gg <dig> and gg <dig> trees, respectively . also, a strong positive influence of elevation on the oleic acid content in the oil, and thus on mufa/pufa, of gg <dig> trees in comparison with gg <dig> trees was found . as peroxides are produced from the oxidation of fatty acids, high levels of peroxide are undesirable, causing rancid taste and reducing the oil shelf-life  <cit> . equally, oleic acid  is a major determinant of mouth-feel, aroma and shelf life of olive oil  <cit> . as both taste and shelf life are likely to have been quality criteria important for early farmers, our results, showing differential responses of the two groups of scion/sucker combination in peroxide values and oleic acid contents, suggest a potential contribution of the mll <dig> rootstock to olive oil quality under different edaphic conditions.

results of the aic-based model selection indicated that all environmental parameters in general had a similar influence on fruit and stone size and weight, and hence on oil content in the fruits, in the two genotype combinations . in addition, average rainfall influenced the quality traits  in gg <dig> and gg <dig> trees in a similar way . however, elevation as well as gdd had a stronger positive influence on peroxide values in gg <dig> than in gg <dig> trees, and elevation had stronger positive effect on the mufa/pufa ratio in gg <dig> trees as compared to gg <dig> trees . thus these results provided further evidence, in addition to the effect of elevation and caco <dig> described above, that some environmental parameters have a differential influence on oil quality in gg <dig> vs. gg <dig> trees. the decreasing abundance of trees belonging to gg <dig>  along an aridity gradient  may imply that grafting on mll <dig> may increase sensitivity of olive trees to drought. support of this hypothesis may be provided by a recent study which showed that young trees that were produced from the common mll <dig> showed higher drought tolerance than trees of the barnea cultivar , suitable for intensive agricultural conditions based on controlled irrigation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results seem to imply that grafting of the common souri cultivar  on the mll <dig> rootstock was governed by two opposing forces. on the one hand, growers in the past may have chosen to graft the common cultivar  on mll <dig> in order to enhance crop performance under certain environments. as mll <dig> was used for grafting much more commonly than other mlls  <cit> , it appears that not grafting alone but grafting on mll <dig> has this positive effect, which suggests deliberate rootstock selection. on the other hand, this advantage of grafting on mll <dig> is countered by the plausible sensitivity of mll <dig> to drought, so that this rootstock was less used in increasingly arid environments. if the scion/rootstock combination mll1/mll <dig> should represent non-grafted trees, it could be concluded that the grafting technique itself was less used in arid environments. recent studies that assessed oil quality of the souri cultivar under different irrigation regimes demonstrated the better performance of the cultivar under rain-fed condition  <cit> . as these oil quality traits reflect the nutritional value of the olive oil, its taste and oxidative status  <cit> , it seems that the scion/rootstock combination mll1/mll <dig> was ideally adapted to conditions in a southeast mediterranean climate.
