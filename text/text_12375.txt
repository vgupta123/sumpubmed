BACKGROUND
cap , also known as ponsin  <cit> , is an adaptor protein which has been associated with regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases and cell adhesion  <cit> . numerous isoforms of cap with different tissue distributions have been described in the literature, although their specific functions remain to be clarified  <cit> . consistent with the function of cap as an adaptor protein, most of these isoforms show a predominant localization with actin cytoskeleton, stress fibers, focal adhesions or cell-cell adhesion structures  <cit> , but an isoform containing a nuclear localization signal has also been described  <cit> .

cap belongs to the so-called sorbin homology  protein family  <cit>  together with vinexin-α and arg-binding protein  <dig> . all three members of this family contain in their n-terminal part one soho domain which was named after its homology to the gut peptide sorbin that participates in the regulation of absorption of water and electrolytes in the gall bladder  <cit> . however, the exact molecular function of the soho domain has only recently been elucidated. the soho domain of cap was shown to be necessary for the formation of molecular complexes with the membrane raft-associated protein flotillin-1/reggie- <dig>  during insulin receptor signaling  <cit> . upon insulin stimulation, cap and c-cbl are recruited by aps  to insulin receptor  <cit> , and c-cbl becomes tyr-phosphorylated. the cap-c-cbl complexes are then recruited to rafts by means of an interaction of the soho domain of cap with flot- <dig>  which results in specific signaling events within raft membranes  <cit> . later findings have suggested that a similar complex containing cap/c-cbl/flot- <dig> would also play a role during signaling mediated by neurotrophic factor receptor trka  <cit> . in addition, other soho proteins have also been suggested to form soho-mediated signaling complexes with flot- <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to the soho domain, a characteristic feature of all these family members is the presence of three sh <dig> domains  in the c-terminal part of the protein  <cit> . sh <dig> domains are well known protein-protein interaction motifs that bind to proline-rich sequences and facilitate the formation of molecular complexes with various ligands  <cit> . the sh <dig> domains b and c of cap/ponsin have been shown to mediate the interaction with afadin which in turn is a binding partner of the transmembrane protein nectin in cell-cell adhesion structures that precede the formation of cadherin-based adherens junctions in epithelial cells  <cit> . the third sh <dig> domain of cap also binds to c-cbl, and focal adhesion kinase  has been reported to bind to sh3-b  <cit> . all three soho proteins directly interact with the actin associated protein vinculin  <cit> , the localization of which largely overlaps that of the soho proteins in cell-matrix adhesions and stress fibers. the interaction with vinculin is mediated by the sh <dig> domains a and b in cap  <cit> .

in agreement with their role as cytoskeletal adaptor proteins, cap, vinexin and argbp <dig> have been shown to be strongly associated with actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions. tyrosine phosphorylation of vinexin-α and argbp <dig> by c-abl tyrosine kinase has previously been reported  <cit> . in both cases, the sh <dig> domains, especially sh3-c, were found to be important for this interaction. cap has also been reported to bind to and coimmunoprecipitate with c-abl in insulin stimulated hepatocytic cell line hep3b, and in vitro experiments indicated that sh3-c in cap would be a binding determinant of c-abl  <cit> . however, no data are available if cap is also phosphorylated by c-abl and how the putative phosphorylation regulates the function of cap. in addition, the possibility that cap might be phosphorylated by other tyr kinases known to be important for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesions, such as the src family kinases, remains to be investigated.

here we show that cap is indeed tyr phosphorylated by both c-abl and c-src, and cap can be coimmunoprecipiated with active forms of the kinases. the sh <dig> domains of cap participate in the interaction in vivo but appear not to be the only binding determinants of c-abl in cap. we have identified tyr <dig> in cap as the primary phosphorylation site of c-abl. in addition, tyr <dig> appears to contribute to the phosphorylation of cap by abl, whereas src phosphorylates both tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  interestingly, mutation of tyr <dig> altered the function of cap during cell spreading, whereas exchange of tyr <dig> or tyr <dig> did not influence the spreading. however, none of the mutations affected the localization of cap in focal adhesions or stress fibers.

RESULTS
cap is tyr phosphorylated in vanadate treated hep3b cells
a previous report showed that cap coimmunoprecipitates with c-abl from insulin stimulated hep3b cells  <cit> . to study if cap is also phosphorylated in these cells, we immunoprecipitated endogenous cap from cells stimulated with insulin or treated with vanadate. a signal for tyr phosphorylated cap was detected in vanadate-treated cells, whereas nonstimulated or insulin-treated cells showed no signal . several isoforms of cap were expressed in hep3b cells, but mainly the  <dig> kda isoform was found to be tyr phosphorylated.

cap is phosphorylated by and interacts with c-abl
since hep3b cells are extremely difficult to transfect and endogenously contain several isoforms of cap, we chose hela cells for further experiments since they do not express any endogenous cap  <cit> . for this, we used overexpression of n-terminally gfp-tagged isoform cap <dig>  which contains a soho domain and three sh <dig> domains c-terminally to it . coimmunoprecipitation of various activity mutants of c-abl  with cap-egfp was analyzed. abl wt and pp were found to coimmunoprecipitate with cap, whereas the abl kd was not . although the expression of abl pp was low in cell lysates  due to toxicity of high level expression, a similar amount to abl wt was detected in immunoprecipitates, indicating that a higher percentage of the cellular abl pp was associated with cap.

it has been reported that the third sh <dig> domain  of cap binds abl in vitro. we thus used cap mutants carrying mutations or deletions in the sh <dig> domain region  to study the coimmunoprecipitation of wt abl. although the full-length cap coprecipitated abl, the c-terminal deletion mutant of cap, Δsh <dig>  missing all three sh <dig> domains, did not precipitate any abl . however, point mutants w660f, carrying a wf substitution in the absolutely conserved, critical trp residue in sh3-c, and the mutant  <dig> × wf, in which all three sh <dig> domains of cap have been mutated, both were capable of coprecipitating reduced but still considerable amounts of abl.

we next studied if cap would be tyrosine phosphorylated by c-abl. upon coexpression of abl wt and pp, a high degree of tyr phosphorylation of cap was detected, whereas no phosphorylation was deteted in cells cotransfected with abl kd . the phosphorylation of cap upon coexpression of abl pp was higher than with abl wt, despite the fact that the expression level of abl pp was much lower than that of abl wt.

having established that cap is a substrate of abl kinase, we studied the phosphorylation of cap mutants containing substitutions in the sh <dig> domain region . consistent with its inability to bind to abl, cap Δsh <dig> was phosphorylated very little upon abl coexpression. however, the wf point mutants containing substitutions either in one of the sh <dig> domains  or in all three sh <dig> domains  showed a phosphorylation comparable to or even higher than wt cap, again consistent with their ability to associate with abl. these results would suggest that although functional sh <dig> domains are not necessary for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cap by c-abl, the c-terminal part of cap is required for a productive interaction.

we then sought to identify the tyr residues in cap that would be phosphorylated by abl. it has been shown that abl preferably phosphorylates substrates with the consensus sequence i/l/v-y-1-5-p/f around the tyr residue to be phosphorylated  <cit> . such a sequence was found around three tyr in cap, namely y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig>  which were mutated into phe residues. phosphorylation of cap upon coexpression of abl was again analyzed . no phosphorylation signal was detected in cells transfected with cap alone or with abl and egfp. the mutant y326f was found to be phosphorylated at about equal level as the wt cap, and y632f showed a moderate reduction of phosphorylation . however, y360f mutant showed a clearly reduced phosphorylation . interestingly, the double mutants y326f+y360f  and y360f+y632f  both exhibited a low degree of phosphorylation. these data suggest that y <dig> is the main phosphorylation site, but y <dig> also seems to contribute to the phosphorylation of cap by abl.

mutation of tyr  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> does not affect the localization of cap into focal adhesions and stress fibers
cap has been reported to localize in stress fibers and to colocalize with vinculin in focal adhesions  <cit> . when wt cap transfected cells were seeded out on fibronectin and allowed to spread , after  <dig> min we observed a localization of cap  in focal adhesions at the cell periphery where it colocalized with vinculin  but only poorly with cortical actin fibers . after the cells had spread out for  <dig> min , a minor fraction of cap colocalized with vinculin  in focal adhesions, whereas most of the cap protein was detected in stress fibers, colocalizing with actin . we could not detect any clear difference in the localization of the y326f, y360f  or y326f+y360f mutant  as compared to the wt cap. however, mutant y632f was localized both in focal adhesions and stress fibers  but additionally showed some nuclear localization. these results imply that abl mediated phosphorylation is not necessary for association of cap with focal adhesions or stress fibers. however, during the spreading of the cells, the localization of cap seems to dynamically change from focal adhesions to stress fibers, according to the spreading state of the cells.

y326f mutant exhibits an inhibitory effect on cell spreading
although the localizations of cap and the tyr mutants were similar during various time points of cell spreading , these data provide only limited information on the role of phosphorylation during active, dynamic cell spreading. in order to study the possible functional role of the tyr phosphorylation, we performed spreading assays of transfected hela cells on a fibronectin matrix . in this assay, the cells were allowed to spread on fibronectin coated surface for  <dig> min, fixed and scored for their spreading state in three categories . the cells transfected with egfp, wt cap, y360f and y632f mutant all showed a high degree  of fully spread cells. however, in the case of the y326f mutant, a clearly inhibitory effect on the spreading of the cells was detected, with only 40% of the cells exhibiting a fully spread phenotype and some 45% showing a half-spread morphology with many filopodia-like protrusions. thus, mutation of tyr <dig> in cap appears to have an inhibitory effect on cell spreading.

cap is phosphorylated by c-src
since tyr <dig> was not a major c-abl phosphorylation site, we sought to identify a putative other kinase that might be involved in the phosphorylation of y <dig> in cap. src kinases are good candidates for this since they have been shown to play an important role not only in signal transduction by growth factors but also in the regulation of cell matrix adhesion. recombinant src kinase was indeed capable of phosphorylating the purified cap-gst protein in an in vitro phosphorylation assay, whereas inhibition of src activity by means of pp <dig> completely abrogated cap phosphorylation in the in vitro assay  and severely impaired it in transfected cells . when cells were transfected with cap-egfp and src kinase constructs , an increased phosphorylation of cap variants was detected, correlating with the activity level of src . the small amount of phosphorylated cap detected in cells transfected with dead-src is most likely due to phosphorylation by endogenous c-src and enhancement upon vanadate incubation. as with c-abl, phosphorylation of cap by c-src appears not to depend on functional sh <dig> domains since the sh <dig> domain mutants of cap were found to be tyr phosphorylated to a comparable level as the wt cap . as with the abl kinase, only active forms of src were found to coprecipitate with cap, and deletion of the sh <dig> region of cap resulted in severely reduced coprecipitation of src with cap .

to corroborate these findings, mouse embryonal fibroblasts genetically ablated for the ubiquitous src kinases src, yes and fyn   <cit>  were transfected with cap-egfp. in these cells, no phosphorylation of cap-egfp could be detected. however, phosphorylation of cap could be rescued upon coexpression of wt and constitutively active src, but not of the kinase dead src. .

in order to identify the residues phosphorylated by src, cap-egfp and its tyr-mutated forms were coexpressed with c-src in hela cells . substitution of y <dig> or y <dig>  which represents the main phosphorylation site of c-abl, alone only moderately impaired the phosphorylation of cap by src. however, the double mutant y326+360f showed a clearly reduced level of tyr phosphorylation, indicating that tyrosines  <dig> and  <dig> both might be phosphorylation sites of src in cap. substitution y632f showed no effect on the phosphorylation of cap by src .

since y <dig> is also the major phosphorylation site of abl in cap, c-src and c-abl kinases could cooperate for the phosphorylation of cap. to test this, cap-egfp was cotransfected with either c-abl or c-src, and the cells were treated with the src inhibitor pp <dig> or a non-inhibitory control compound pp <dig>  pp <dig> was used since, in contrast to pp <dig> and many other src inhibitors, it does not inhibit abl kinase activity in the concentration used here. inhibition of src activity in c-abl transfected cells resulted in a reduction of cap phosphorylation, whereas in src transfected cells, no phosphorylation of cap could be detected upon use of pp <dig>  these results would imply that there is some cooperativity of cap phosphorylation between c-src and c-abl.

discussion
we have here shown that endogenously expressed cap can be tyr phosphorylated in hep3b hepatocytes, whereas previous findings from others have demonstrated that in these cells, cap can be coimmunoprecipitated with c-abl kinase  <cit> . although other members of the soho protein family have been shown to be phosphorylated by c-abl  <cit> , our report is the first demonstration of tyr phosphorylation of cap by any kinase. cap has been shown to play a role in membrane receptor signal transduction, e.g. insulin and neurotrophic factor signaling  <cit> . we were not able to detect phosphorylated cap in insulin treated hep3b cells, whereas vanadate stimulation resulted in robust tyr phosphorylation of cap. this might indicate that the phosphorylation of cap during signaling is regulated by rapid dephosphorylation by phosphatases, and thus phosphorylation can only be detected upon inhibition of phosphatase activity by vanadate. it will be of interest to determine if cap is phosphorylated in other cell types during signaling processes, and if so, which kinases and phosphatases mediate the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

the third sh <dig> domain of cap  has previously been shown to bind to c-abl in vitro  <cit> . according to our results, the delta-sh <dig> mutant of cap missing all three sh <dig> domains was neither capable of coprecipitating c-abl nor phosphorylated by it. however, we observed only a slightly reduced coprecipitation of c-abl with the mutants in which either sh3-c or all three sh <dig> domains of cap were mutated. as the trp substitutions render sh <dig> domains incapable of binding their poly-pro containing recognition signals, these results would suggest that although the binding site of abl in cap is located in the c-terminal part containing the sh <dig> domains, there have to be determinants other than the sh <dig> domains, e.g. the linker regions in between, which are important for the interaction of abl with cap. interestingly, the linker region between sh3-b and -c contains a putative pro-rich sequence  which might function as a binding site for the sh <dig> domain of c-abl, thus facilitating a dual interaction mediated by sh <dig> domains/pro-rich regions in both proteins. a similar binding mode has also been implicated between vinexin and c-abl  <cit> . however, mutation of the pqqp motif into aeea did not significantly reduce the phosphorylation of cap in the presence of intact sh <dig> domains . although this would rather speak against the role of the pqqp motif in the binding of abl, an interaction mediated by more than one determinant would also be supported by the fact that the constitutively active abl-pp mutant coprecipitated with cap more than c-abl. in abl-pp, two pro residues in the linker region between the sh <dig> and kinase domain have been mutated so that the protein acquires an open conformation  <cit>  and might be able to bind more efficiently to its substrate, cap. on the other hand, since phosphorylation of cap was readily observed in cells coexpressing wt abl and cap, this might imply that binding of cap to c-abl could even increase the activity of the kinase which is under tight regulation in normal cells . however, further experiments will be required to clarify the exact binding mechanism between cap and abl.

we have here identified tyr <dig> in cap as a major phosphorylation site by c-abl, although tyr  <dig> also might contribute since its substitution in combination with the y360f mutation reduced the phosphorylation of cap to a very low level. both tyr conform to the consensus c-abl phosphorylation motif. interestingly, in mouse vinexin, the major phosphorylation site of c-abl is provided by y <dig> with some possible contribution by y <dig> and y <dig>  <cit> . however, different from y <dig> in cap, tyr <dig> of vinexin does not seem to reside in a consensus phosphorylation motif for c-abl.

cap localizes to focal adhesions, where it can bind vinculin, fak, paxillin and filamin c and to actin stress fibers, which is probably, at least to some degree, mediated by different sets of binding partners  <cit> . in fibroblasts, overexpression of cap has been described to slow down the spreading of cells onto extracellular matrix  <cit> . however, according to our data, cap does neither inhibit nor enhance the spreading of epithelial cells onto fibronectin. this could be explained by the differences in the modes of regulation of focal adhesions and cell spreading between different cell types or by the presence of binding partners of cap in fibroblasts that result in inhibitory effects. although c-abl is an important regulator of cytoskeletal remodeling and many of its substrates are known to participate in the coordination of actin-dependent processes, we could not observe any effect on cell spreading when y <dig>  the major c-abl phoshorylation site of cap, or y <dig> were mutated to phe. both mutants were also localized in both focal adhesions and stress fibers in a very similar way to the wt cap protein. the y632f mutant also exhibited some nuclear localization which is at present difficult to explain. although a nuclear form of cap, termed r85fl  <cit> , has been described, the isoform used here does not contain the nuclear localization signal shown to mediate the nuclear transport of r85fl. thus, the nuclear translocation of y632f mutant might be mediated by its interaction with another protein that is capable of being transported into the nucleus, as has been shown the case with teneurin- <dig> and cap  <cit> .

since substitution of the major abl phosphorylation sites in cap resulted in normal spreading of the cells, phosphorylation of cap by c-abl does not seem to play a major role in this process. however, the mutation of y <dig> slowed down the spreading, indicating that phosphorylation of this tyr by another kinase might be important for the regulation of cap function during cell spreading. indeed, we could show that y <dig> is phosphorylated by c-src, another non-receptor tyr kinase that regulates many actin dependent cellular processes, including focal adhesion assembly and spreading  <cit> . if phosphorylation of y <dig> by c-src indeed plays a role in the regulation of cell spreading by cap still needs to be clarified in more detail in future studies.

as with abl, the binding and phosphorylation of cap by src was severely compromized by deletion of the c-terminal sh <dig> region but not by mutations in the critical trp residued in the sh <dig> domains of cap. thus, also in the case of src, the linker regions between the sh <dig> domains and the pro rich sequences might mediate the interaction between the kinase and its substrate. the main phosphorylation sites y <dig> and y <dig> do not reside in the sh <dig> region but more n-terminally to it, and thus the reduced phosphorylation of Δsh <dig> cap by src and abl is unlikely to be simply due to deletion of phosphorylatable tyr residues. in addition, mutation of six tyrosines within the sh <dig> domain region of cap  which all fit well to the consensus phosphorylation sequence of src did not affect the phosphorylation of cap by c-src . thus, the sh <dig> region is more likely to be important for the substrate-kinase interaction rather than providing substrate tyrosines.

substitution of y <dig>  the major abl phosphorylation site, alone only moderately impaired the phosphorylation of cap by src. however, the double mutant y326f/y360f showed a severely impaired phosphorylation by both src and abl, implicating that both kinases might actually cooperate to achieve the full degree of phosphorylation of cap. it could be speculated that src plays only an indirect role in the phosphorylation of cap by facilitating abl activation and thus increasing abl-mediated cap phosphorylation. however, our in vitro phosphorylation assay with purified proteins showed that cap is a direct substrate of src. furthermore, cap interacted with src in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and y <dig> fits well to the consensus phosphorylation sequence of c-src. thus, it appears that both c-src and c-abl are capable of directly phosphorylating tyrosines  <dig> and  <dig> in cap, but each show a preference to a different tyr. however, inhibition of src activity in cells expressing c-abl resulted in slightly reduced phoshorylation of cap. thus, both kinases appear to contribute to the phosphorylation and thereby generate binding sites for sh2-containing proteins which would link cap downstream towards processes resulting in actin remodeling. the details of the interplay between src and abl in the phosphorylation of cap should be clarified in future studies in order to understand the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of the function of cap.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results show that cap is a direct substrate of both c-abl and src kinase which each phosphorylate cap at least in one tyr residue. however, both kinases appear to have their preferential phosphorylation sites in cap. the details of the functional regulation of cap by abl- and src-mediated phosphorylation still need to be clarified in future studies. the soho proteins show a very similar localization pattern, share many binding partners and are all phosphorylated by c-abl. so far, the details of the functional significance of abl-mediated phosphorylation have not been characterized for any of the soho proteins. thus, it will be important to address the specific downstream events that result from the phosphorylation of each of the soho family members and which thus mediate the functional differences between these proteins. further work will also show how phosphorylation of cap by abl and src contributes to its function.
