BACKGROUND
genome-wide differential gene expression analysis is widely used in discovery-based studies in biology and medicine. the question of how variability impacts reproducibility of genome-wide results has been subject to extensive research  <cit> . it is known that unwanted variation is often a confounding factor. unwanted variation refers to other factors that influence the observed gene expression levels besides the one of interest. a typical example is a batch effect, which can occur when some samples are processed differently than others. batch effects are not the only source of unwanted variance. unwanted variance in microarrays arising from technical aspects of the methodology is removed using normalization methods such as rma  <cit> . the amount of unwanted biological variance depends on the question of interest and is influenced by factors such as heterogeneity in cell-types, variability in responsiveness to stimulus between biological replicates and the simultaneous presence of other stimuli other than the one of interest, such as time of day or other environmental variables. all of these factors are present when studying gene expression in the brain in vivo and are often hard to control. thus, in the context of brain and behavior a major challenge is to normalize unwanted variation to minimize false discoveries, increase resolution and maximize the potential of discovery-based approaches to contribute biological insight.

several aspects of brain function are linked to transcriptional changes. long-term memory formation, for example, is known to require transcription, protein synthesis and epigenetic processes that regulate gene expression  <cit> . how memories are stored and retrieved in the brain is a fundamental question in neuroscience. thus, characterizing genome-wide the transcriptional changes that occur after memory acquisition and retrieval is of broad interest and importance. research has shown that there are "sensitive periods" after memory acquisition during which inhibiting mrna or protein synthesis impairs memory formation. using contextual fear conditioning as a task, these windows occur immediately or  <dig> hours after acquisition for memory tested  <dig> hours later  <cit> , or  <dig> hours after training for memory tested a week later  <cit> . processes that follow retrieval of the memory trace  also require transcription and protein synthesis  <cit> . several studies have used genome-wide approaches such as microarrays to describe changes in coding and non-coding gene expression after memory acquisition or synaptic activity  <cit> . these studies have led to the identification of some genes relevant for memory formation, such as c-rel or mir- <dig>  <cit> . it remains unclear to what degree the variety of other stimuli experienced by the brain in vivo hinders reproducibility and limits the applicability of genome-wide technologies to the study of the brain and behavior.

here, we examined genome-wide gene expression after contextual conditioning in the mouse hippocampus, a brain region essential for memory formation, during all the established sensitive periods for transcriptional inhibition. we show that most of the variance in gene expression is not due to conditioning and that by removing unwanted variance through additional normalization we are able provide novel biological insights. we show for the first time that histone variants are downregulated after memory acquisition, and splicing factors and micrornas after retrieval. our results provide mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of cognition by highlighting the differential involvement of epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone variants and post-transcriptional rna regulation, after acquisition and retrieval of memory.

RESULTS
we examined genome-wide changes of gene expression in adult, male c57bl6/j mice following a contextual fear conditioning paradigm , a form of learning in which an aversive stimulus  is associated with a neutral context . re-exposure to the context triggers retrieval of the memory for the context-shock association , which is quantified as freezing in mice. fc is highly reproducible among individuals, requiring a single exposure to the cs-us pairing to learn. in addition the timeline of sensitivity for transcriptional inhibition is established, making it an ideal learning task for our genomic study. fc is known to require the hippocampus, a brain region essential for long-term memory formation. hippocampal tissue was collected at the established sensitive periods for transcriptional inhibition during memory consolidation:  <dig> minutes ,  <dig> hours ,  <dig> hours  or  <dig> hours after fc , as well as  <dig> minutes after memory retrieval . animals in the retrieval group showed typical learning of the task, with average freezing of 55%  after re-exposure to the context. animals that were handled but not trained were dissected at the same time of day to control for circadian variation in gene expression . rna from nine animals per group representing nine independent behavioral experiments conducted at the same time of day  was hybridized simultaneously to an affymetrix gene titan mouse  <dig>  gene-est microarray. pairing of the cs and us was necessary to evaluate proper retrieval of the memory trace. we have previously shown that genome-wide gene expression changes in the hippocampus  <dig> minutes after exposure to the cs alone are not different from those after cs+us pairing  <cit> . these results suggest that in this brain region the us alone does not produce significant differences in gene expression and that differences in gene expression observed are likely due to the encoding of the spatial memory for the context alone. therefore, we did not include animals exposed to only the cs or us in the design.

individual variability and circadian time are the biggest drivers of variance in gene expression in the hippocampus in vivo
to explore the main sources of variance in the data, we first performed a principal component analysis   <cit>  . none of the first three principal components , which account for over 65% of the variance, capture the response to the treatment. understanding the dominant sources of variance is critical to accurately assess the effects of learning in gene expression. the first and second principal components  represent unusual variability in gene expression in individual mice . interestingly, the contribution of pc <dig> and pc <dig> to variance in gene expression is correlated for a subset of genes  and may represent the same biological process. functional annotation analysis of the genes with correlated scores between pc <dig> and pc <dig> shows that they represent response to olfactory stimuli, specifically pheromones , suggesting that individual responses to, or environmental variations in olfactory stimuli are the strongest drivers of differences in gene expression.

there is substantial evidence that memory consolidation is affected by circadian time  <cit> . however, the circadian influence on genome-wide gene expression in the mouse hippocampus is poorly understood. published genome-wide studies of gene expression in response to activity in the brain that include several time points often do not include controls for time of day  <cit> , and thus it is hard to distinguish the effect of neuronal activity from the circadian effect in such studies. in our analysis, the third principal component  reveals that circadian time has a strong influence on hippocampal gene expression. additional file 1d shows that the effect of circadian is similar to the effect of learning at the second  and third  sensitive periods, but not immediately after  memory acquisition or retrieval. to characterize gene expression changes in the mouse hippocampus due to circadian time, we compared genome-wide gene expression among our three control time-points . the greatest number of differences in gene expression was detected between cc <dig> and cc <dig>  these time points correspond to zeitgeber times  <dig> and  <dig> , one time-point during the light phase and one during the dark phase.  <dig> probe sets, corresponding to  <dig> known genes, were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate  < <dig> . . to determine whether our dataset corresponds to known circadian regulated genes, we compared it to those genes known to oscillate in the mouse liver according to hughes and colleagues  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes regulated by time of day in the hippocampus,  <dig> oscillate with  <dig> hour periodicity in the mouse liver . this overlap is significantly higher than expected by chance  based on an expected 15% overlap between any  <dig> mouse tissues as reported in the mouse gene atlas  <cit> ). our dataset is the first genome-wide dataset describing the effects of circadian time on gene expression in the hippocampus. genes differentially expressed between zt <dig> and zt <dig> in the hippocampus include per <dig>  per <dig> and per <dig>  which are known circadian oscillators  <cit> . interestingly, genes usually thought to be associated with memory formation, such as arc, bdnf  <cit> , cbp  <cit>  and p <dig>  <cit>  also show circadian changes in expression .

memory acquisition and retrieval induce similar, but distinct, genome-wide changes in gene expression  <dig> minutes after exposure
to accurately assess the effect of contextual conditioning in gene expression in the hippocampus, we first removed unwanted variation detected by pca by normalizing the expression matrix using k =  <dig> pcs, as described in experimental procedures. subsequently, differential expression analysis was only carried out in comparison to time of day matched controls, to ensure that circadian time was not a confounding variable in the analysis. in addition to increase power, we implemented local false discovery rates  based on empirical null hypothesis estimation to account for multiple testing  <cit> . local fdr estimation provides advantages above traditionally used benjamini and hochberg fdr correction  <cit>  in cases in which the null distribution can be easily estimated from the data, or in other words in datasets in which the majority of the genes are not differentially expressed due to the treatment such as ours. after normalization, we observe the greatest number of gene expression changes at the first sensitive period during memory consolidation :  <dig> probe sets, representing  <dig> known genes . the number of genes whose expression changed at the two other sensitive periods  was small and non-overlapping . no changes in gene expression were detected  <dig> hours after training. we cannot distinguish which transcriptional changes correspond to the memory for the context alone and which ones to the memory for the context with the shock. we have previously shown, however, that gene expression changes detected in the hippocampus  <dig> minutes after fc using microarrays are not significantly different from those induced by context alone  <cit> . thus it is possible that the signal-to-noise resolution in genome-wide studies is not enough to differentiate the transcriptional responses between those two memory traces. hierarchical clustering revealed that genome-wide changes immediately following acquisition  were similar to changes observed after retrieval of memory  . additional file  <dig> summarizes the results of the effects of contextual conditioning in the mouse hippocampus. the number of genes regulated at fc30' and rt30' is shown in figure 1c at two different false discovery rates, fdr< <dig>  and < <dig> . fold changes observed through microarrays are small. our use of whole hippocampal homogenates will dilute the signal when only a small proportion of the cells in the sample  are responsible for the changes, and thus statistically robust differences in expression that appear small in magnitude are expected.

several genes not previously reported to be regulated by memory acquisition and retrieval in the hippocampus were identified and validated by qpcr in a new cohort of animals . we show that log fold-changes as small as  <dig>  in microarrays are reproducible by qpcr in an independent set of experiments. changes in gene expression that are similar between fc30' and rt30' include the induction of btg <dig> and sik <dig>  as well as the downregulation of sox <dig> . the potential role of these identified gene candidates in learning and memory can be largely substantiated by available literature. btg <dig> is a pan-neural gene whose deletion or overexpression has been shown to alter contextual memory  <cit> . it has been previously shown to be induced in the amygdala after contextual conditioning  <cit> , but not in the hippocampus. sox <dig> is known to interact with mef <dig>  an important regulator of neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and hippocampal learning  <cit> . sik <dig>  another candidate gene identified in our study, also affects mef <dig> activity as well as being a repressor of creb transcription through crtc  <cit> . creb-dependent and mef2-dependent transcription are both known to be important for long-term memory formation. memory acquisition and retrieval also induce per <dig> expression; however they differentially affect expression of the two known isoforms . indeed per <dig> knockout mice have been shown to have hippocampal-dependent memory deficits  <cit> . measuring expression of exon <dig> which is present in both isoforms by qpcr shows an increase only at rt30'. however, measuring only expression of isoform  <dig>  shows a sharp increase at fc30' and a reduction at rt30' , suggesting that both processes differentially affect per <dig> splicing. we also confirmed induction of a majority of genes previously shown to be upregulated after memory acquisition and reproduced in several studies. these include arc, fos, fosb, dusp <dig>  egr <dig> , egr <dig>  nr4a <dig>  junb, sgk <dig>  npas <dig>  ddit <dig> and nfkbia.  <cit> , all of which are also upregulated after retrieval . we do not observe induction of bdnf at fc30' in our microarray analysis or by qpcr analysis of levels of individual bdnf isoforms , contrary to what has been previously reported  <cit> . bdnf induction does not peak until  <dig> hours after fear conditioning  <cit> , thus levels of bdnf may not have increased sufficiently for detection in our samples.

to investigate which functions or pathways are affected by memory acquisition and retrieval, we carried out functional annotation and functional interaction analyses of protein coding genes. figure 3a depicts the relationship between genes regulated in fc30' and rt30' and the corresponding functional categories. the scatterplot shows t-statistics of differential expression relative to cc30' for both groups plotted relative to each other. genes that are statistically significant in the fc30' vs. cc30' comparison at fdr < <dig>  are shown in red, and those significant in the rt30' vs. cc30' comparison in blue. the upper-right quadrant highlights genes that are up-regulated in both conditions. interestingly, the overlap between fc30' and rt30' concentrated in upregulated genes shows enrichment for a single functional class: transcriptional regulation , and includes genes such as btg <dig>  fos, egr <dig>  egr <dig>  nr4a <dig>  junb, and nfkbia. further detail on the results of the functional annotation analysis can be found in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  to identify the regulatory networks involved the regulation of this class of genes; we performed functional interaction network analysis of up-regulated genes at both time-points . the results suggest that three main transcriptional networks are being activated by both memory acquisition and retrieval, all highly interconnected: a mapk/creb network, an nf-κb network, as well as a network represented by per <dig> . these results agree with a previously established role of the mapk/creb and nf-κb transcriptional pathways in learning and memory formation  <cit> , and thus provides further evidence supporting the robustness of our approach.

memory acquisition and retrieval downregulate different epigenetic processes that modify gene expression
an interesting observation in figure 3a is that the lower-left quadrant is almost empty, showing little overlap between downregulated genes. accordingly, genes downregulated after acquisition and retrieval show no overlap in function. chromatin assembly is downregulated after acquisition , exemplified by histone 2a isoforms hist1h2af, hist2h2ab, hist1h2ao and hist2h2aa <dig>  rna processing is downregulated after retrieval , exemplified by splicing factors prpf38b and rbfox <dig>  and spliceosome kinase srpk <dig>  downregulation of genes involved in chromatin assembly observed in our microarray after acquisition is driven by downregulation of histone 2a isoforms. based on closer inspection of the probe-level data, hist2h2ab emerged as the h2a gene most likely regulated by during memory consolidation. greater than 2-fold downregulation of expression of hist2h2ab, herein referred to as h2ab, was confirmed by qpcr in an independent cohort of animals .

to further investigate regulation of histone variants following memory acquisition we performed a quantitative proteomics analysis using a nanolc-ms/ms platform  <dig> hour after contextual conditioning. the high similarity of sequence makes it challenging to determine the specificity of the regulation of h2a variants at the protein level using antibody-based technologies. we found that h2ab was detectable in proteomic analyses  and easily distinguished from other h2a variants. as can be seen in the tandem mass spectra  the  <dig> da shift produced by the unique presence of a valine instead of an isoleucine in h2ab  allows for the distinction of this novel activity-dependent variant from other h2as using proteomics. quantification of abundance of histone variants  demonstrates that h2ab is the most abundant variant in the mouse hippocampus. h2ab is also the only variant significantly downregulated by contextual conditioning , consistent with the microarray and qpcr data, although trends for the reduction of h2a.z and h2a.x are also observed. because h2ab has not been previously characterized, we used a molecular evolution approach to investigate its relationship to h2a variants that have been characterized more thoroughly. the resulting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree  show that h2ab is an h2a variant 100% conserved between human and mouse that is closely related to h2a.x and h2a.j whose role in transcriptional regulation has yet to be studied. histone variants have emerged as key players regulating epigenetic processes such as chromatin structure and dynamics  <cit> . although there is a great deal of knowledge regarding the importance of epigenetic processes such as histone modifications and dna methylation to memory formation  <cit> , the role of histone variants has not yet been explored. it has been previously shown that during rat cortical neuron differentiation there are changes in h2a and h <dig> variant composition  <cit> . more recently, an h2a variant  necessary for the survival of olfactory neurons was identified, and its expression has been shown to be regulated in an activity-dependent manner  <cit> . our data suggests that histone variants, and thus broader epigenetic changes such as global changes in chromatin accessibility, may be an important component of the epigenetic mechanisms recruited at the first sensitive period during memory consolidation.

memory retrieval had a bigger impact on processes that regulate rna processing. the downregulation of splicing factor rbfox <dig> was also replicated by qpcr in an independent cohort . to our knowledge, this is the first time that rbfox <dig> has been reported to be regulated by behavior. rbfox <dig> is an important regulator of both splicing and transcription in brain development  <cit>  that controls neuronal excitability  <cit> . clinically, rbfox <dig> deletion is correlated with developmental delays, learning disabilities and autistic-like features  <cit> . the results of the functional annotation analysis , the validation of the down-regulation of rbfox <dig> by qpcr  and the differences in alternative splicing of per <dig> observed between fc30' and rt30' , suggest that post-transcriptional regulation may be of particular importance following memory retrieval. splicing regulators have been previously reported to change expression during memory formation  <cit> . however, alternative splicing following memory formation at the genome-wide level has not been previously examined. greater efforts in future experiments will be directed at understanding the regulation of different spliced isoforms after acquisition and retrieval.

memory consolidation and retrieval differentially regulate non-coding rna expression
we also evaluated the regulation of  <dig>  non-coding transcripts with well-established annotation. a summary of non-coding rnas regulated either at fc30' and rt30' can be found in additional file  <dig>  microrna genes mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were selected for further validation. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are creb-dependent micrornas derived from the same precursor that are induced by ltp  <cit>  and play an important role in neuronal plasticity  <cit> . mir- <dig> expression is dependent on the activity of nmda receptors  <cit> , which play an essential role in the acquisition of spatial memories in the hippocampus  <cit> . in addition, we selected three non-coding rnas whose role in brain function has not been studied previously for further validation: two variants of a small nucleolar rna  and mir- <dig>  one of the micrornas contained within the mirg imprinted non-coding rna cluster. snord14e and snord14d represent some of the highest fold changes seen in our microarray while mirg is strongly expressed in the brain during development  <cit> . mirg contains at least  <dig> micrornas  including mir- <dig> whose expression is known to be specific to the central nervous system  <cit> .

microarray results may reflect expression of microrna precursors or processed micrornas, because rna hybridized to the microarray was not specifically selected to include small rna species. therefore, we performed a second set of experiments isolating small rnas for subsequent quantification using qpcr to evaluate the expression of mature micrornas. the results show upregulation of the non-coding rnas mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  snord14d and snord14e following memory acquisition  and retrieval  ; although the levels of upregulation observed differ between the two time-points. the induction of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> is not surprising given that they both are induced by ltp  <cit>  and mir- <dig> has been shown to increase in response to the barnes maze learning paradigm  <cit> . transgenic expression of mir- <dig> impairs novel-object recognition memory  <cit> , suggesting that these micrornas have a functional role in memory storage. differential regulation of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> after memory acquisition and retrieval raises the interesting possibility that they target different genes during those processes, although so far the few known experimentally validated targets are shared between mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> . a lot less is known about mir- <dig>  but the experience-dependent induction we observe along with the specificity of its expression within the central nervous system and the strong association of one of its targets  with autism  <cit> , point to an important role of this microrna in the regulatory networks that underlie memory consolidation. brain-specific snornas have been previously reported to be induced in the hippocampus by contextual fear conditioning  <cit> . however, the function of snornas in post-transcriptional gene regulation in the brain remains largely unexplored.

downregulation of mir- <dig> was only found to be significant after retrieval , supporting our previous observation that retrieval downregulates genes involved in rna processing. mir- <dig> is known to regulate protein levels of camkiiγ  <cit> . to investigate if the observed reduction of mir- <dig> had a functional effect on protein levels of camkiiγ we performed western-blots in an independent cohort of animals  and found that camkiiγ protein levels are indeed significantly increased  after memory retrieval . it is not clear if the molecular changes we observe after retrieval correspond to reconsolidation or extinction of the memory trace. based on available literature  <cit> , the observed down-regulation of mir- <dig> and up-regulation of camkiiγ is consistent with the hypothesis that a single brief re-exposure to the context may inhibit nmdar activity while maintaining or even increasing camkii signaling and thus promote memory reconsolidation while inhibiting extinction. although it is likely that camkiiγ plays an important role in camkii mediated signaling, its specific function remains unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
our study characterizes gene expression genome-wide, both protein coding and non-coding, at several time-points during memory consolidation and following retrieval of memory. we show that training is not the main source of variance in gene expression. we introduce the removal of unwanted variance though normalization to the study of transcriptional changes genome-wide in the context of brain and behavior. using this approach, we successfully identify novel gene expression changes following contextual conditioning as well as reproduce the majority of the previously reported changes. the largest changes in gene expression related to memory formation are observed  <dig> minutes after memory acquisition and  <dig> minutes post retrieval. we identify a novel activity-dependent histone variant, h2ab, and show that is downregulated following memory acquisition. we point to several gene candidates that have not been previously described to be involved in learning and memory, including transcriptional regulators sox <dig>  btg <dig> and sik <dig>  and splicing factor rbfox <dig>  finally, we examine genome-wide non-coding rna regulation following memory acquisition and retrieval, pointing to a likely important role of micrornas mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and snornas snord14d and snord14e in posttranscriptional regulation during both processes as well as a specific role for and mir- <dig> and its target camkiiγ after retrieval. epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression have been shown to be essential to long-term memory formation. our study underlines the importance of two currently understudied epigenetic processes to memory storage and retrieval: histone variants and post-transcriptional rna regulation; the study of which will expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which the brain maintains long-lasting changes induced by experience.
