BACKGROUND
snw/skip proteins, which include human ski-interacting protein  and its yeast homologue the essential splicing factor prp <dig>   <cit> , are phylogenetically highly conserved  <cit> , and important during early development  <cit> . skip was identified by its interaction with the proto-oncogenes, v-ski and c-ski  <cit> . in addition to pre-mrna splicing in the spliceosome  <cit> , skip appears to have multiple other functions in transcription  <cit> . it acts as a transcriptional co-regulator of a number of key cellular signalling molecules, such as of creb binding protein / p <dig>  the nuclear co-repressor  and silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors   <cit> . it also interacts with a large range of dna binding proteins, including smad <dig> and  <dig> proteins of the tgf-β pathway  <cit> , and proteins involved in myod and notch signalling  <cit>  and may be involved in wnt signalling  <cit> . a recent study suggests skip regulates the cell cycle arrest factor p <dig>  and subsequent effects on p53-dependent dna cell damage  <cit> . this appeared to involve recruitment of skip to the p <dig> promoter where skip plays a critical role for splicing and p <dig> gene expression, suggesting a role of skip in cancer cell apoptosis.

the fundamental effects of skip in transcriptional regulation are supported by its co-regulatory effect on nuclear hormone receptors, including estrogen receptor  <cit> , the vitamin d receptor  and retinoid x receptor   <cit> , which it antagonistically regulates in association with sirt <dig>  <cit> . more recently skip was shown to associate with p-tefb, c-myc and menin to act on the hiv- <dig> promoter  <cit> .

the androgen receptor  is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that regulates male sexual development, and is a major player in the pathogenesis and progression of prostate cancer  <cit> . upon binding to its natural ligands testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone , the ar becomes phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds as a homodimer to canonical nuclear receptor inverted repeat dna response elements to activate target gene transcription  <cit> . a comprehensive chip-on-chip analysis of ar-responsive elements  on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> however suggests that the majority of the  <dig> identified binding sites are non-canonical, with isolated half-sites, head-to-head, head-to-tail and direct repeat ares  <cit> .

the ar contains distinct structural domains also found in other nuclear receptor superfamily members. the amino -terminal transactivation domain, which is also termed ligand-independent activation-function- <dig> domain , is followed by a dna-binding domain  that is linked via a hinge region to a carboxy -terminal ligand-binding domain , which contains the activation function- <dig> domain   <cit> . ligand binding induces interaction between the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of ar  <cit> . this interdomain rearrangement slows ligand dissociation and ar degradation  <cit> . moreover, mutations in the ar af- <dig> domain, which are associated with partial or complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, also abrogate n/c-interaction in vitro, suggesting that n/c-interaction is functionally important in vivo <cit> . the ar intrinsic n-terminal fxxlf  and wxxlf  motifs form amphipathic α-helices that stabilise the n/c-interaction, by binding to a hydrophobic pocket at the c-terminus  <cit> . importantly, the intrinsic xxlf motifs compete with the similar, extrinsic lxxll-motif from p160-family type i co-regulators for the hydrophobic pocket on the ar c-terminus  <cit> . examples for type  <dig> co-regulators are steroid receptor co-activators , transcriptional intermediary factor  <dig>  and amplified in breast cancer- <dig>   <cit> .

while af- <dig> mediates hormone-independent constitutive transactivation when artificially isolated, the af- <dig> is inactive in the absence of hormone, but required for strong, ligand-dependent activity in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells  <cit> . this may be due to the fact that even in the absence of ligand the extended af- <dig> fragment  assumes a similar reticular or speckled distribution to nuclear foci, as the full-length receptor with its co-regulators, while the isolated af- <dig> is distributed homogenously in the nucleoplasm, even if ligand is added  <cit> . this speckle-pattern distribution is typical for markers of various nuclear compartments, such as speckles, nucleoli and cajal bodies  <cit> . nuclear speckles are sites of pre-mrna splicing and skip was found among other splicing proteins enriched in nuclear speckles  <cit> .

in this study, we demonstrate that skip interacts with the ar. we show that skip acts in multiple ways, by augmenting ar af-1-dependent activity as a classical type i co-activator, while it also enhanced ar n/c-interaction and ar-dependent transcription in prostate cancer cells.

RESULTS
mammalian one-hybrid data show that skip augments ligand-independent ar transcription
skip modulates the transcriptional activity of a variety of nuclear hormone receptors. we therefore tested, whether skip can also act as a co-regulator of androgen receptor , which is critically involved in prostate cancer  <cit> . to address, whether skip influences ar-mediated transactivation, we used a mammalian one-hybrid assay, which assesses the transcriptional co-activating property of a candidate protein  on a potential interaction partner  fused to the gal <dig> dna binding domain. the presence of the co-activator increases binding of the fusion protein to gal4-binding sites on the reporter plasmid, which then drives luciferase transcription  <cit> . we expressed in hek <dig> cells a fragment comprising the n-terminal ligand-independent activation-function- <dig>  domain of ar  fused to the gal <dig> dna binding domain  with and without skip. in the absence of the ar1- <dig> fusion protein, overexpression of skip did not induce reporter gene expression compared to control cells co-transfected with empty vectors . consistent with the ligand-independent transcriptional activity of the ar af- <dig> domain  <cit> , transfection of the ar1- <dig> fusion protein induced a 10-fold increase in basal, ligand-independent luciferase activity compared to control levels. this ar-af- <dig> transcriptional activity was increased ~5-fold by overexpression of skip . these data suggest a co-stimulatory activity of skip by a functional interaction with the n-terminal ligand-independent activation-function- <dig>  domain of ar.

skip facilitates interaction of ar n- and c-termini
ar transcriptional activity is modulated by ligand-mediated interdomain interaction of its n- and c-termini  <cit> . to address, whether skip facilitates ar n- and c-terminal, ligand-dependent interaction, the mammalian two-hybrid system was used  <cit> . in the mammalian two-hybrid system, potentially interacting protein fragments are fused to either the gal <dig> dna binding domain  or the v <dig> transactivation domain. interaction of the fused proteins brings the gal4-dbd and v <dig> domain into a complex, which increases transcription of luciferase from a gal <dig> responsive promoter. residues 1– <dig> of ar were fused to the vp <dig> activation domain and c-terminal ar-lbd residues 642– <dig> to the gal <dig> dna binding domain  to detect n/c-terminal interaction. modulation of this interaction by skip would alter reporter gene expression in hek <dig> 

in the absence of skip, the ar n- and c-terminal, ligand-dependent interaction resulted in a significant increase in relative luciferase activity by 12-fold . skip also enhanced ligand-dependent activation of the ar-lbd 642– <dig> construct by 9-fold . overexpression of skip markedly increased ligand-dependent transcriptional activity mediated by the ar n- and c-terminal constructs to ~300-fold over control levels . thus skip facilitates the ligand-induced, interdomain interaction of the n- and c-termini of ar or processes downstream of this rearrangement, augmenting ar transcriptional activity by an order of magnitude.

skip increases ar-dependent transcription in prostate cancer cell lines
to provide further evidence that skip is a co-activator of ar function, the effects of skip overexpression on ar–dependent transcription were assessed using the androgen-responsive mouse mammary tumour virus  mmtv-luc and the prostate-specific antigen  psa-luc luciferase reporter plasmids in a prostate cancer cell line. we used the ar-negative pc <dig> cell line, where we overexpressed wt ar. in these cells skip overexpression augmented basal ligand-independent mmtv reporter activity ~6-fold. additional stimulation with the ar ligand dht  increased activity ~18-fold over control levels , without any apparent dose-dependence . on the other hand, skip alone induced only a 2-fold increase in basal psa-reporter activity. this was however markedly and dose-dependently increased by dht , as compared to pc3-cells without co-transfected skip .

these results suggest that skip augments dht-induced mmtv- and psa-reporter activity several-fold, with a response pattern that depends on the reporter gene construct.

skip co-immunoprecipitates with androgen receptor
skip has been shown to interact with a number of nuclear hormone receptors via its helical repeat domain  <cit> . we therefore investigated, whether skip is also in a complex with ar in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment .

we co-expressed ar with skip in cos- <dig> cells and precipitated bound proteins from the cell lysates using anti-ar or anti-ha antibodies . ha tagged skip proteins  were specifically detected in ar-immunoprecipitates in similar amounts, irrespective of whether cells were dht treated . consistent with ar co-immunoprecipitating ha-skip, the inverse experiment showed that ar protein  was specifically detected in ha-skip immunoprecipitates .

in conclusion, these data suggest that ar and skip interact in a specific complex.

fret experiments reveal interaction of ar and skip in the nucleus
finally, we wanted to monitor ar and skip interaction in intact living cells and provide evidence for their direct interaction, using förster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer  imaging. we transiently co-expressed ar, which was c-terminally tagged with ecfp  as fluorescent donor, and skip, n-terminally tagged with eyfp  as an acceptor in bhk cells . the eyfp-skip construct localized to small nuclear structures of various sizes . for our fret experiments, we selected for those cells that contained larger skip-positive nuclear structures. note, that even under serum starvation, cells exhibited various degrees of nuclear co-localization of ar-ecfp and eyfp-skip . using donor-dequenching fret experiments on maximally dht stimulated bhk cells, we measured a high fret efficiency of 57±3%, as compared to 11±2% background .

in order to gain further insight into the temporal characteristics of this interaction, we followed the dht induced nuclear translocation of ar-ecfp to eyfp-skip positive structures in live bhk cells. we used sensitised acceptor emission fret imaging with fully crosstalk corrected fret images  <cit> . when stimulated with dht , ar-ecfp accumulated on eyfp-skip positive structures of the nucleus within 3 minutes , with concomitant increase in the fret signal . on individual skip-positive nuclear structures, the fret signal first increased at the periphery and then progressed towards the centre. thereafter, the fret signal decreased, due to a drop in the eyfp-skip signal, which was not due to photobleaching caused by progressive scanning of the sample .

in conclusion, fret-experiments provide additional evidence that a direct and transient interaction of ar and skip occurs within the nucleus, which increases within minutes after dht-stimulated nuclear translocation of ar.

discussion
in this study we provide evidence that skip acts as a co-regulator of ar transcription. using mammalian one- and two-hybrid-experiments, we showed that skip augments ar af- <dig> ligand-independent transcriptional activity and ar ligand-dependent af- <dig> and af- <dig>  transcriptional interaction. moreover, skip augmented ar-dependent transcription with two are-containing reporters in prostate cancer pc <dig> cells. immunoprecipitation and fret-experiments showed that ar interacts with skip and that the ar translocates to the nucleus within minutes after ligand stimulation to interact with skip.

fret detects proximities of 3–7 nm for ecfp/eyfp-fret pairs  <cit> , which is a distance that can in most cases be regarded to report on direct interactions, considering that the size of the fluorescent proteins is already 2 nm × 4 nm  <cit> . the observed high fret efficiency between ar-ecfp/ eyfp-skip on the speckle patterned skip-positive structures is therefore in agreement with a direct interaction of these proteins.

our fret data are supported by our one- and two-hybrid data, which suggest that skip can activate both the n- and c-terminus of ar. therefore, fret-fluorophores on the c-terminus of ar and n-terminus of skip may come into very close proximity, despite the relatively large size of both proteins. the strong increase of fret upon dht-stimulated nuclear translocation of ar-ecfp to eyfp-skip positive structures that resemble nuclear speckles, can be explained by the fact that an excess of the acceptor, eyfp-skip, leads to high fret-levels in a molecular complex, where the donor-acceptor-ratio is 1: > <dig>  <cit> .

nuclear speckles form a functional compartment within the nucleus that include splicing factors. active gene transcription coupled with pre-mrna splicing is thought to occur at the periphery of the splicing factor compartment  <cit> . it was therefore intriguing to see that the fret between skip and ar increased from the outside to the inside of the speckle-like skip-positive structures. however, as fluorescently tagged proteins had to be overexpressed, care must be taken when relating the magnitude of the fret with the affinity of the two proteins under physiological conditions. on the other hand, overexpression does not seem to induce random interaction in our experiments, as the interaction only significantly increased a) after dht-stimulation and b) involving a translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. we cannot say, whether ar is in addition targeted to other nuclear compartments.

it is of interest that the ar af- <dig> domain has been shown to interact within nuclear speckles with another splicing factor ant- <dig>   <cit> . this distribution resembles the ar-skip co-localization that we have observed . thus ar interaction with skip and skip enhancement of ar af- <dig> transcriptional activity is similar to ar/ ant-1-dependent augmentation of transcription and splicing. therefore, further studies will be required to determine if skip, like ant- <dig> may recruit ar into a transcription-splicing coupled machinery.

interestingly, the skip-eyfp signal disappeared completely ~16 minutes after dht mediated translocation of ar to the nucleus, suggesting ar-mediated degradation or masking of skip. loss of the skip-eyfp signal started soon after the maximum fret was reached, raising the possibility that a regulated degradation is triggered at high ar concentrations. the ar has been previously linked to proteasome-mediated degradation, by its interaction with ubiquitin protease usp <dig>  <cit> , the ubiquitin ligase arnip  <cit>  and sensitivity of ar transactivation to proteasome inhibitors  <cit> .

ar transcriptional activity is dependent on its n-terminal and c-terminal domains, which if artificially isolated can act in a ligand-independent  and ligand-dependent  manner, respectively  <cit> . immunoprecipitation and fret-data allow us to explain the transactivation data by the direct interaction of skip with ar, however details of the exact mechanism are still unclear. we showed that the ar n-terminal domain was sufficient to engage skip to increase transactivation. it is possible that in a transcriptionally active complex, such as that induced by the n-terminal ar fragment, skip is engaged in the recruitment of general co-regulators such as n-cor and p <dig>  <cit> . in line with the latter interpretation, it was previously found that ar ligand-dependently interacts with the nuclear receptor co-repressor, n-cor  <cit> , which also interacts with skip  <cit> .

moreover, our two-hybrid data indicate that skip bi-functionally interacts with the n- and c-termini of ar, or at least facilitates this n/c- interaction. interestingly, saitoh et al.  <cit>  observed something similar for the effect of the co-regulator cbp, which is also required for nuclear foci or speckle formation. in addition, src <dig> also modulates n/c-terminal interactions  <cit> , however, this and its co-regulator activities are handled by distinct parts of the protein with an apparently higher significance for its lxxll-motif independent interaction  <cit> . moreover, co-regulators were shown to modulate the n/c-interaction, in a cell type dependent manner. correspondingly, their effect on the n/c-interaction did not always correlate with their effects on ar-mediated transactivation or cell growth, which may highlight the importance of specific microenvironments that influence this interaction  <cit> . this may be explained by the assumption that the af- <dig> may be the major transactivator under normal physiological conditions, while type i co-regulators come into play, if their concentration is high, such as observed in recurrent prostate cancer  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data suggest skip as a novel ar co-activator that enhances its af- <dig> function and interdomain-interaction, as well as ar-dependent transcription. the diverse network of interactions shown for skip, in particular with nuclear hormone receptors, explains its impact on several signalling pathways involved in growth and development, including possibly in ar-dependent prostate cancer cell growth.
