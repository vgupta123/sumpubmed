BACKGROUND
since tissier discovered the bifidobacterium spp. in  <dig>  <cit> , over  <dig> species have been isolated and identified  <cit>  and the first genome sequence of a bifidobacterium is now available  <cit> . analyses of amplified partial 16s rdna sequences assigned to uncultivated bifidobacteria suggest the existence of more new bifidobacterium species <cit> . bifidobacteria are known to be heterofermentative anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria which belong to the class of actinobacteria  <cit>  containing genomes with a high g+c content. they mainly colonize the intestines of humans, other mammals and insects  <cit> . some bifidobacteria have also been isolated from environmental sources such as sewage  <cit> . bifidobacteria have been described as strictly anaerobic bacteria in the sense that they are not able to grow on agar-plates in the presence of air  <cit> . however, some bifidobacterium strains were described which were at least partially aerotolerant in the presence of reducing agents in liquid media  <cit> . genome analyses of bifidobacterium longum suggests that both growth and survival under oxygen pressure are linked with the presence of a set of oxygen-scavenging nadh oxidases  <cit> . strains of a novel species, bifidobacterium psychraerophilum, were recently reported to be able to grow under air on the surface of solid agar-medium  <cit> . based on heat-shock protein hsp <dig> encoding sequence homologies, this species clusters distinctly from aerotolerant species of the genera scardovia, aeriscardovia, parascardovia and gardnerella which were related or belonged to the genus bifidobacterium before the recent reclassification  <cit> . for probiotic use of a particular bifidobacterium strain, oxygen tolerance is an important characteristic for maintaining cell viability in end products.

the classification of bifidobacterium species has most often been done in the past mainly by 16s rdna sequence homology analysis  <cit>  and confirmed by an enzymatic assay of d-fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase  <cit>  whose encoding gene xfp is widespread among microorganisms and not unique to bifidobacterium species  <cit> . these results were then substantiated by determinations of dna-dna relatedness  <cit>  as well as physiological properties such as carbohydrate fermentation profiles in order to discriminate between single species of the genus bifidobacterium. recently, phylogenetic trees for bifidobacteria were constructed based on groel genes encoding heat-shock protein hsp <dig>  <cit> , groes genes encoding chaperon  <cit>  and xfp encoding phosphoketolase  <cit>  as alternatives to 16s rdna-based phylogenetic trees. these trends support the polyphasic approach for species identification as suggested several years ago  <cit> . the phylogenetic positions of bifidobacteria groel  seem to generally agree with 16s rdna-based phylogeny, and in several studies, have been more discriminative than 16s rdna sequences for species delineation  <cit> . in a previous study,  <dig> isolates of bifidobacterium species from infant faeces have been described, six of which showed bacteriocin-like activity against listeria monocytogenes which represents a rare property among bifidobacteria  <cit> . in this work, the taxonomic position of one of these isolates, strain rbl <dig>  whose properties did not match with any of the so far described bifidobacterium species, was determined using 16s rdna sequence homology, comparative groel gene sequence analysis, dna-dna genome hybridizations and carbohydrate fermentation patterns. this study aimed to classify rbl <dig> due to its features which may be used industrially in the future and was not intended to for a complete phylogenetic analysis of bifidobacterium sp.

RESULTS
phylogenetic position of bifidobacterium sp. rbl67
because 16s rdna sequences are the most widely used molecules in phylogenetic classification of bacteria, the 16s rdna fragment of strain rbl <dig> was amplified by pcr using the lm3/lm <dig> primer pair . the sequence of the resulting fragment  showed the highest homologies to 16s rdna sequences of other bifidobacteria from the genbank  with the highest similarity, 99%, to the sequence of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t , isolated by zhu et al.  <cit> , and 94% to that of the bifidobacterium thermophilum type strain  . a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the 16s rdna sequences using a consensus length of  <dig> kb. the tree shows clustering of rbl <dig> with the bifidobacterium thermophilum/thermacidophilum/boum branch , described as the "thermophilic group" by zhu et al.  <cit> .

there is insufficient discriminating power to clearly assign a 16s rdna to a species within the genus bifidobacterium since similarity values for this gene can range from 93% to 99% between species, as reported in other studies  <cit> . therefore a polyphasic approach, as suggested by vandamme et al.  <cit> , was used in this study to identify the unknown strain rbl <dig> at species level.

comparative analysis of groel gene sequences
the next step of the classification process was to compare the partial groel gene sequences  of bifidobacterium rbl <dig> , b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t   and b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t  with those of other bifidobacteria from the genbank. based on a consensus length of  <dig>  kb, a phylogenetic tree was constructed  and rooted with bacillus subtilis w <dig> . the tree shows common clustering of strain rbl <dig> with the bifidobacterium thermophilum/thermacidophilum/boum branch, which substantiates the 16s rdna comparisons presented in fig.  <dig>  according to the 16s rdna tree, strain rbl <dig> splits off earlier on the branch and is closer related to b. thermophilum  whereas using partial groel sequences, strain rbl <dig> is on the same branch as b. thermacidophilum . the comparison of 16s rdna sequences and partial groel sequences showed a discrepancy between the classification of strain rbl <dig> based on those methods. by comparing the partial groel gene sequences, bifidobacterium rbl <dig> is more closely related to b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t  than to b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t  whereas based on 16s rdna sequences strain rbl <dig> is closer related to b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t  than to b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t . according to the definition of zhu et al.  <cit>  a similarity of  <dig> –100% and  <dig> –97% is required for intraspecies and inter-subspecies differentiation by partial groel sequences, respectively. by applying this definition to partial groel gene sequencing data , bifidobacterium rbl <dig> could belong to the species thermacidophilum or it could be a subspecies of b. thermophilum dsm20210t , which is contradictory. clearly sequencing analysis of partial groel could not provide enough evidence to confirm the phylogenetic classification of bifidobacterium isolate rbl <dig> 

dna-dna hybridization and g+c-content
for the final classification of bifidobacterium rbl <dig>  dna-dna hybridization was performed. the results  confirmed that the partial groel gene sequence was not sufficient to differentiate between species. according to the limit of 70% similarity required for species identification  <cit> , only bifidobacterium boum dsm20432t could be defined as a different species by dna-dna hybridization. b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t was on the limit of this definition; its classification as a new species was justified by data from both dna-dna hybridization and phylogenetic data reported by dong et al.  <cit> . however, our dna-dna hybridizations provide evidence that b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t belongs to b. thermophilum, showing  <dig> % homology to b. thermophilum dsm20210t . bifidobacterium rbl <dig> showed  <dig> % homology with b. thermophilum dsm20210t and could also not be discriminated as a new species. bifidobacterium rbl <dig> showed even less similarity to b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t and b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t than to b. thermophilum dsm20210t . furthermore the homologies between bifidobacterium rbl <dig> and both b. thermacidophilum strains were similar  while the homology between b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t and b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t was only  <dig> %. the result reported by dong et al.  <cit>  from dna-dna hybridization,  <dig> % similarity between b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t and b. thermophilum dsm20210t, was not confirmed in this study. this might be due to different methods of dna isolation, dna-dna hybridization or interpretation of the data.

n. d.: not determined

based on the data by dna-dna hybridization, which is still the strongest method for bacterial species differentiation, we classified strain rbl <dig> as bifidobacterium thermophilum.

the g+c content of dna from bifidobacterium rbl <dig> was  <dig>  mol-% as determined by dsmz germany. this compared well with the g+c determination of b. thermophilum dsm20210t,  <dig> mol-%, but differed from that of b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t and b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t, which were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mol-% g+c, respectively.

physiological properties of bifidobacterium sp. rbl67
cells of bifidobacterium rbl <dig> grew well on mrs-c agar incubated anaerobically at 37°c overnight and on rb-agar at 40°c in  <dig> h. they were non-motile, irregularly shaped rods and formed pairs when growing on plates . on rb-agar, they formed yellow colonies with a diameter of  <dig> mm. when growing in liquid culture, agglomeration of cells occurred . this agglomeration was ph dependent: the lower the ph, the greater the agglomeration of cells. the formation of agglomerates was inhibited by ph control at ph  <dig> . in contrast to b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t, aggregated cell clumps of bifidobacterium rbl <dig> were not easily dispersed again, even after extended mixing.

bifidobacterium rbl <dig> was moderately oxygen tolerant; therefore it was not necessary to perform dilutions and inoculations anaerobically. however, the strain did not grow on agar plates under aerobic conditions after  <dig> days. no selected gas atmosphere was necessary to grow the strain in liquid culture. while sparkling the liquid media with oxygen-free nitrogen or carbon dioxide, bifidobacterium rbl <dig> ceased to grow. to determine the level of oxygen tolerance, anaerobic media were purged with oxygen as described by meile et al.  <cit> . fig.  <dig> shows the growth curves for bifidobacterium sp. rbl <dig> at different levels of oxygen in reduced medium. at  <dig> % oxygen in the bottle growth of this strain was maintained, showing its elevated tolerance to oxygen. even at  <dig> % oxygen, the od still increased fivefold during incubation for  <dig> h. b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t and b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum lmg21689t showed similar growth curves to strain rbl <dig> under oxidative stress, but seemed to grow slightly better at  <dig> % oxygen after  <dig> h of fermentation . nonetheless, all the strains tested were less oxygen tolerant than b. animalis subsp. lactis, which was shown to tolerate  <dig> ml of oxygen in comparable reduced medium  <cit> .

+, positive reaction; -, negative reaction; w, weak reaction; d, variable reaction → colour could not be assigned to either yellow or blue; n. d.: not determined

as for a lower ph limit, rbl <dig> and rbl <dig> were the only strains still growing at ph  <dig> under the growth conditions of the study. b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum lmg21395t did not grow at this ph, which was reported by dong et al.  <cit> . the upper ph limit for growth was not determined, but all tested cultures still grew very well at ph  <dig>  the molar ratio of acetate to lactate from glucose for bifidobacterium rbl <dig> was determined as  <dig>  to  <dig> in mrs-c medium at 37°c under anaerobic conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to classify the bifidobacterium isolate rbl <dig> at species level, we used a polyphasic approach since phylogenetic trees based on partial groel gene  and 16s rdna sequences generated similar but not identical results for species classification. berthoud et al.  <cit>  reported similar difficulties when studying the "thermophilic group", which could not be differentiated at the species level by xfp gene sequencing. they proposed the use of 16s rdna sequencing, as an additional method for species differentiation. however, our dna-dna hybridization data  revealed a very close relationship between b. thermophilum species and b. thermacidophilum species and questioned the current classification of b. thermacidophilum as a discrete species. our hybridization data were substantiated by phylogenetic data, molecular characterization and physiological properties and allowed the classification of strain rbl <dig> into the species bifidobacterium thermophilum. in contrast with a previous report  <cit> , among our tested strains  only b. boum could be clearly classified as a species different from b. thermophilum based on dna-dna hybridization. this finding suggests that partial groel gene sequences may not be reliable as a single tool for bifidobacterium species differentiation. however, more studies have to be done to confirm this suggestion.

as stated before, we did not intend to perform a complete phylogenetic analysis. however, as more data  become available on strains closely related to b. thermophilum rbl <dig>  a complete phylogenetic analysis could be performed which may lead to a new definition of the boum/thermophilum/thermacidophilum branch.

a very important finding of this study is that b. thermophilum could be isolated from human origin . in previous studies, b. thermophilum has been classified as an animal-related species mainly present in ruminant faeces  <cit> . since it was previously possible to differentiate between animal and human bifidobacteria by species identification, it has been suggested that bifidobacteria should be used to discriminate between animal and human bacterial contamination in foods  <cit> . because b. thermophilum rbl <dig> was isolated from baby faeces, it is likely that this species can not be used as animal contamination indicator. on the other hand, gavini et al.  <cit>  detected b. adolescentis, a species predominantly found in human, in cow dung, swine and rabbit faeces which restricts the number of bifidobacterial species that can be used for human faecal contamination detection.

another discrimination tool between human and animal bifidobacteria strains was the temperature growth limit of 45°c for strains from human origin  <cit> . b. thermophilum strains are able to grow at 47°c and since they can also be found in human faeces , the use of the temperature is not reliable anymore for the discrimination of the origin of bifidobacteria. however, since only a few species are able to grow above 45°c, the assignment to a bifidobacterium sp. can be narrowed. further studies are now undergoing to determine whether b. thermophilum is more widespread within humans.
