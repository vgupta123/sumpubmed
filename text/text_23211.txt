BACKGROUND
a major challenge following the sequencing of the human genome is to determine the biological functions of the estimated  <dig>  genes. inducing mutations in mouse genes and determining their consequences in the whole animal is a powerful approach for gaining insight into the functions, regulatory networks, and gene-environment interactions of homologous human genes. to provide a systematic and comprehensive functional annotation of every gene in the genome using mouse mutagenesis will undoubtedly require numerous complementary strategies, such as gene knockouts, conditional knockouts, and point mutagenesis with the chemical n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea   <cit> .

the ethylating chemical enu is the most potent mutagen in the mouse, with a per-locus mutation frequency, based mainly on detecting mutant phenotypes at visibly marked loci, ranging from approximately 1/ <dig> for a single  <dig> mg/kg dose to 1/ <dig> for a fractionated  <dig> ×  <dig> mg/kg dose  <cit> . since enu induces primarily single base pair  substitutions in dna, it is especially useful for producing an allelic series of mutations in a gene, where each mutation may result in different degrees of severity of the mutant phenotype or even in completely different mutant phenotypes. depending on the location of the mutation within the gene and on the specific base pair substitution, enu-induced mutations may cause amorphic , hypomorphic , antimorphic , hypermorphic , and neomorphic  protein changes, which permit a fine-scale dissection of gene function and generally reflect the types of gene variations found in the human population. this ability of enu to induce mutations that cause various types of changes in proteins provides valuable insights into protein structure and function that cannot be obtained with knockout mutations.

the power of enu  as a tool for the high-throughput functional annotation of gene sequences has been applied to two primary mutagenesis strategies in mice using either whole mice or mouse embryonic stem  cells: the phenotype-driven mutagenesis screen  <cit>  and, more recently, the gene-driven mutagenesis screen  <cit> . an advantage of the phenotype-driven approach is that it does not presuppose the functional roles of any of the genes in the genome, permitting the investigator to identify genes in specific biological processes, pathways, or responses based on the phenotype screens being employed. the strategy yields definitive mutant phenotypes, which cannot always be predicted in gene-driven approaches. furthermore, phenotype screens have often identified mutations in novel genes, or in known genes for which the resulting mutant phenotypes were not readily predictable from the biochemical functions of the gene products. however, after identifying mice with the desired mutant phenotype, the underlying genetic mutation must still be mapped and cloned. additionally, phenotype-driven mutagenesis is not a viable approach for recovering mutations in a pre-selected set of genes for which no functional information is available.

the completion of the mouse genome sequence and the development of new efficient methods for the rapid detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  have made it practical to functionally annotate mammalian genes using high-throughput, cost-effective, gene-driven mutagenesis strategies in the mouse. the benefit of a gene-driven mutagenesis approach is that one can go directly from the dna sequence information for any gene to the isolation of mutations. gene-driven mutagenesis screens have been performed both in mouse es cells  <cit>  and in the whole mouse  <cit> . in practice, the dnas from large numbers of mutagenized es-cell clones or the g <dig> progeny of mutagenized male mice are screened for mutations in pre-selected target genes by high-throughput snp detection methods, and the cryopreserved es cells or sperm are used to recover mutant mice for phenotype analysis.

these recent developments in es cells and in mice demonstrate that it is now possible to take full advantage of the availability of the mouse genome sequence and the mutagenicity of enu to rapidly produce allelic series of mutations in target genes for functional genomics studies. to complement existing embryonic stem-cell-based gene-driven mutagenesis resources, such as gene-trap libraries  <cit>  and enu-mutagenized ct129/sv es cells  <cit> , as well as enu-mutagenized mice on a mixed genetic background  <cit>  or a c3heb/fej inbred genetic background  <cit> , we generated a cryopreserved bank in the c57bl/6j inbred genetic background consisting of dna, eight pooled organs , and sperm from  <dig>  g <dig> mice that each carry a load of paternally induced enu mutations. this cryopreserved mutant mouse bank  is a source of induced, heritable snps in virtually every gene in the genome. we used high-throughput temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis   <cit>  to screen a total of  <dig> mbp of pcr-amplified dna and cdna from these cmmb mice, which resulted in the identification of  <dig> enu-induced mutations in  <dig> target genes. because of the advantage of keeping the cmmb on the sequenced c57bl/6j background for future widespread ease of use of the mutant mice, and the inherent difficulties in recovering c57bl/6j mice from cryopreserved sperm by in vitro fertilization , we applied intracytoplasmic sperm injection  of cryopreserved sperm for the recovery of mutations.

the unique features of the gene-driven mutagenesis approach presented here include:  the cmmb was generated on the defined c57bl/6j genetic background;  in addition to genomic dna, cdna templates isolated from the pooled, cryopreserved organs of each mouse were also screened for mutations;  single-pass, multiplexed tgce was implemented for high-throughput mutation screening; and  live mutant mice were successfully recovered from the cryopreserved sperm by icsi, an assisted reproduction technique that will significantly extend the life of the sperm for each of the  <dig>  males in the cmmb and that will provide for gene-specific point mutations recovered on an inbred c57bl/6j background. thus, the cmmb will be a useful resource for providing mouse models with a wide range of altered proteins for phenotypic, gene/protein-network, and structural biology-type analyses.

RESULTS
construction of the cmmb
the cmmb consists of genomic dna, cdna, tissue powders, and sperm harvested from  <dig>  g <dig> male mice born from the mating of enu-treated c57bl/6j males to untreated c57bl/6j females. at the time of euthanasia, genomic dna was prepared from the tail of all  <dig>  mice and the sperm was cryopreserved. additionally, eight organs  were harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, pooled, ground into a powder, and stored in liquid nitrogen. to date, one-fourth of the pooled tissue powder from each of the first  <dig> mice  was used to prepare rna and first-strand cdna for mutation screening. the  <dig>  dnas and  <dig> cdnas were arrayed into 96-well plates for pcr amplification of selected genes and mutation screening by tgce .

screening the cmmb for enu-induced point mutations by tgce
screening of the cmmb for gene-specific point mutations followed the protocol outlined in figure  <dig>  specific segments of selected genes were amplified by pcr from the genomic dna or cdna templates in the cmmb. the pcr products were denatured and reannealed to generate heteroduplexes in those samples where an enu-induced point mutation was present. high-throughput tgce analysis was then employed to screen the pcr products for the presence of heteroduplexes. tgce analysis was performed in a 96-capillary array instrument , in which pcr-amplified dna and cdna samples were separated by capillary electrophoresis in a single broad temperature gradient. samples containing mutations were identified on the basis of altered electrophoretic patterns of homoduplexes and heteroduplexes caused by their different melting equilibria and electrophoretic mobilities  <cit> . samples containing heteroduplexes were confirmed by repeating the tgce analysis only on those samples, and then sequenced to identify the specific base pair mutation.

prior to the large-scale pcr and tgce screening of the cmmb for mutations in selected gene fragments , the following pcr, tgce, and dna sequencing quality-control measures were implemented. pcr primers were designed to amplify genomic dna containing one or two larger exons and the adjacent splice sites, or to amplify cdna spanning multiple smaller exons. the amplicons were designed to be ~150– <dig> bp in length. the optimal annealing temperature of the primers in each pcr or rt-pcr reaction was determined using a gradient thermal cycler, and the products were examined by electrophoresis through agarose gels and by tgce to evaluate their suitability for mutation screening. the pcr amplicons were also purified and sequenced on both strands with the same primers used to generate the pcr product, in order to confirm the specificity of the pcr reactions.

high-throughput mutation screening of the cmmb was performed by pcr amplification of the dna and cdna samples in 96-well plates, followed by the direct analysis of these pcr products for mutations  by tgce. amplicons were initially analyzed by tgce in two overlapping temperature gradients . subsequent improvements in the gel matrix used for tgce in the sce <dig> instrument permitted the analysis of all amplicons in a single 50–60°c temperature gradient. sixteen of the  <dig> mutations reported here were identified using this new high-viscosity high-resolution gel matrix. our maximum throughput for tgce analysis using the new matrix in the sce <dig> was nine 96-well plates per day. the  <dig>  dna samples are in forty-four 96-well plates . thus, one amplicon can be screened in the entire cmmb in one week.

we increased the throughput of mutation detection an additional three-fold by routinely performing pcr amplification and tgce analysis of multiple amplicons simultaneously . a typical three-fold multiplex experiment with cdna templates is shown in figure  <dig>  three pairs of pcr primers were combined in a single pcr reaction for each of the cmmb cdna templates . the pcr products were then directly analyzed for the presence of heteroduplexes by tgce, which resulted in the identification of a mutation in one of the three multiplexed amplicons in cmmb sample # <dig> . this mutation was confirmed by repeating the pcr and tgce analysis of sample # <dig> , and direct dna sequence analysis of the pcr product identified an enu-induced a-to-g mutation in the heterozygous dna sample . we also determined that the throughput for mutation detection can be increased an additional 10-fold by pooling the dna or cdna templates  prior to pcr and tgce analysis .

mutation screening by tgce with a single broad range of temperatures eliminates the need to determine the optimum melting temperature for any amplicon, and also increases the efficiency and throughput of the screen. as a result of this broad temperature range, the four peaks that are expected in an electropherogram following tgce analysis of a dna sample with a heterozygous point mutation  are, in practice, typically compressed into two peaks. of the  <dig> mutations reported here , two were detected as three peaks,  <dig> were detected as two peaks, and the remaining four mutations were seen as "shoulders" on the primary peak, all following first-pass tgce analysis .

types of mutations and mutation frequency in the cmmb
genomic dna and cdna templates were used to screen for mutations in  <dig> amplicons from  <dig> genes by tgce analysis . the entire cmmb  was screened for  <dig> of these amplicons, whereas a portion of the bank  was screened for the remaining  <dig> amplicons, resulting in a total  <dig> -mbp screen. amplicon sizes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. a total of  <dig> point mutations was identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, which equals a mutation frequency of  <dig> mutation for every  <dig>  mbp screened. thus, on average, screening a 364-bp amplicon in all  <dig>  samples in the cmmb will yield one new mutation. the number of mutations identified per amplicon ranged from none to two. of the  <dig> mutations identified:   <dig> were identified in genomic dna templates and the remaining three in cdna templates;   <dig> occurred in a-t base pairs and five in g-c base pairs;   <dig> were transitions and six were transversions; and   <dig> occurred in the coding regions of genes, one was in the promoter, one was in the 3' utr, and four were in introns. of the  <dig> mutations that occurred in the coding regions of genes,  <dig> were missense mutations  and three were silent mutations.

two sequence homology-based tools, sorting intolerant from tolerant   <cit>  and polymorphism phenotyping   <cit> , were used to predict the potential impact of the  <dig> nonsynonymous dna changes on protein structure and function . generally speaking, these programs predict whether an amino acid substitution will impact protein function based on sequence comparisons among evolutionarily related proteins. the potential impact of each nonsynonymous change is reported as tolerated or not tolerated , or benign, possibly damaging, or probably damaging .

asift scores indicate if amino acid changes are predicted to be not tolerated  or tolerated . sift scores and predictions in parentheses should be interpreted with caution because the median sequence conservation score was > <dig> .

recovery of mutant mice from cryopreserved sperm by icsi
the cmmb includes  <dig> straws of sperm from each mouse. upon thawing one straw for icsi, the sperm was washed with nim medium  to remove the cryoprotectant, resuspended in nim medium, aliquoted into  <dig> cryovials, refrozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. one of these  <dig> smaller aliquots of sperm was used per morning of icsi, thus providing for ~ <dig> days of icsi for each g <dig> male in the cmmb.

as an additional quality-control measure prior to the recovery of mutant mice with the cryopreserved sperm, the mutation of interest was re-sequenced in the sperm dna. icsi was performed essentially as described  <cit>  with minor modifications . to date, live mutant mice have been recovered for nine of the  <dig> mutations by injecting the cryopreserved c57bl/6j sperm into b6d2f <dig> ova . most of our injections have been performed with b6d2f <dig> ova because of the increased efficiency of recovering live mice from cryopreserved c57bl/6j sperm using hybrid ova  <cit> . however, icsi was also performed with c57bl/6j ova for one of these nine mutations and live mice were recovered, demonstrating the ability to recover cmmb mice on the c57bl/6j genetic background. future efforts will be directed toward recovering mutant cmmb mice with only c57bl/6j ova.

genotyping and breeding mutant mice for phenotype analysis
g <dig> mice recovered by icsi with c57bl/6j g <dig> sperm and b6d2f <dig> ova were genotyped for the presence of the heterozygous point mutation with the same pcr and tgce methods used to identify the mutation originally in the cmmb. heterozygous g <dig> mutant mice were then mated to wild-type c57bl/6j mice to produce heterozygous g <dig> offspring. multiple pairs of heterozygous g <dig> mice were intercrossed to produce  <dig> g <dig> mice for phenotype analysis. offspring from the g <dig> intercrosses were genotyped by tgce or dna sequencing of pcr products .

the nine lines of mutant mice recovered by icsi are at various stages in this process, ranging from heterozygous g <dig> mice, to homozygous mutant g <dig> animals that are undergoing phenotype analysis. the results of the phenotype analyses will be described elsewhere. we are also in the process of cryopreserving embryos for the lines of mutant mice recovered by icsi. the frozen embryos will then be advertised on our web site at ornl  <cit> , which can also be searched via the international mouse strain resource web site  <cit> .

discussion
in this study we generated a bank of dna, tissues, and sperm from  <dig>  male progeny of enu-mutagenized c57bl/6j mice, employed tgce as a high-throughput and cost-effective gene-driven approach for identifying mutations, and used icsi to recover live mice from cryopreserved sperm of males carrying specific mutations. an initial  <dig> -mbp screen of genomic dna and cdna templates in the cmmb resulted in the identification of  <dig> point mutations, with a per-base-pair mutation frequency of  <dig> in  <dig>  mbp . this mutation frequency is comparable to the frequency reported for other gene-driven enu mutagenesis screens in mice  <cit> . of these  <dig> mutations,  <dig> of them  were missense mutations  with the potential to cause functional changes in the encoded proteins. therefore, one missense mutation was identified in the cmmb per  <dig>  mbp screened, or one potential functional change for every  <dig> bp screened in all  <dig>  mice. if we impose a stricter definition and consider that only the nonconservative amino acid substitutions are likely to cause functional protein changes, then nine of the  <dig> mutations  reported here are in this category. using this stricter definition, one functional change was identified in the cmmb for each  <dig>  mbp screened or, on average, one functional change  was identified for every  <dig> bp screened in all  <dig>  mice. based on these data and the current size of the oak ridge cmmb, screening an entire gene with an open reading frame of ≥  <dig>  kb would result in ≥  <dig> functional alleles. to identify functional allelic series' in smaller genes, or in a small discrete region of a gene, it would be advantageous to proportionately expand the size of the cmmb .

the sift and polyphen programs predicted that seven of the  <dig> nonsynonymous dna changes might have an effect on protein structure and function. the predictions made by these tools were often in disagreement and should therefore be viewed with caution. however, these types of predictions do offer additional information when trying to prioritize the order in which lines of mutant mice will be recovered from frozen sperm for phenotype analysis.

tgce as a high-throughput screening method
tgce  <cit>  was employed as a rapid, efficient, and cost-effective method for identifying enu-induced point mutations in the cmmb. the relatively new tgce technology has been used for clinical applications to identify mutations in factor v  <cit> , hepatitis c virus  <cit> , mtdna in nonmelanoma skin cancer samples  <cit> , and the cyctic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene  <cit> . more recently, as part of a phenotype-driven enu mutagenesis screen, our group demonstrated that tgce is an effective method for identifying mutations in candidate genes associated with mutant mouse phenotypes that map to defined chromosome intervals  <cit> , and two other groups have applied tgce to gene-driven enu mutagenesis screens  <cit> .

in the present study, we also demonstrated that tgce is a powerful tool for identifying rare mutations in pre-selected genes within a large bank of mutagenized dna samples. there are numerous advantages to using tgce for gene-driven enu-induced mutagenesis screens. tgce analysis has a greater than 95% mutation-detection rate  <cit> . tgce permits direct analysis of very small volumes of unpurified pcr products that can also be multiplexed, even amplicons with different melting temperatures. mutations are identified from first-pass screening without the need to predetermine the melting temperatures of different amplicons. finally, tgce is sensitive enough to permit sample pooling. in our hands using the sce <dig>  we were able to analyze nine 96-well plates per day. we demonstrated a routine ability to perform three-fold multiplexing of samples, and we determined that we could identify single enu mutations from pools of  <dig> dna samples. experiments are under way to combine pcr/tgce multiplexing and sample pooling to significantly increase throughput. for example, by pooling eight samples , the  <dig>  cmmb samples could be reduced to six 96-well plates. if three amplicons  were screened by pcr and tgce simultaneously  in these pools of eight dna samples, a  <dig> -mbp screen could be completed in a single day. at our current mutation frequency of  <dig> in  <dig>  mbp in the cmmb, this could result in the identification of three enu-induced mutations per day, with at least one of them causing a nonconservative amino acid change in the encoded protein.

screening both genomic dna and cdna templates
in addition to the  <dig>  tail-dna samples in the cmmb, we began preparing and screening cdna samples from the corresponding  <dig>  tissue powders. there are advantages to having both dna and cdna for mutation screening. the dna templates are more abundant and less expensive to produce than cdna templates, and they permit the screening of exons and their splice junctions. since it is desirable in terms of throughput to screen large amplicons that contain mostly coding sequences, dna templates are best suited for screening large single exons, or two to three small exons separated by small introns. however, because the average exon size in mouse is only ~ <dig> bp , using cdna templates allows one to design large amplicons that consist only of coding sequences. mutation screening of cdnas permits rapid coverage of the gene's entire coding region, which is especially useful if one wants to screen a conserved functional motif that spans numerous small exons spread across a large genomic distance. one potential drawback to the use of cdna templates is that nonsense-mediated mrna decay could potentially decrease the efficiency of identifying enu-induced mutations that introduce premature termination codons, although this type of mutation will occur infrequently compared to those that cause amino acid substitutions. the possible decreased efficiency of identifying such truncation mutations in our screen, which may result in null alleles, would be minimized if a knockout mutation already existed for the gene of interest.

rationale for overcoming inbred c57bl/6j fertility problems by icsi
the cmmb was deliberately generated with inbred c57bl/6j mice so it would be in the "reference" genetic background for the mouse genome. although recovering live mice from cryopreserved c57bl/6j sperm by ivf is very inefficient compared to some other mouse strains  <cit> , this problem is overcome with icsi  <cit> . we used icsi successfully to recover live mice from the cryopreserved cmmb sperm, including frozen sperm that was thawed and refrozen without cryoprotectant, using both b6d2f <dig> ova and c57bl/6j ova. some lines were recovered with only one or two sessions of icsi injections. other lines required many attempts, but we have not yet failed to recover any line. although icsi requires a higher level of technical expertise and more hands-on time compared to ivf, it is useful for recovering live mice from highly mutagenized, frozen, c57bl/6j sperm, and it significantly extends the life of the sperm bank. this latter point is not a trivial issue, given that each of the  <dig>  sperm samples in the bank came from a single g <dig> male. using icsi to recover live mice from frozen sperm in the cmmb, we effectively have enough sperm from one cmmb male to perform a minimum of  <dig> days of icsi. more importantly, the extra effort involved in mutation recovery with icsi will be well worth it for the long-term usefulness of the c57bl/6j mutant mice, especially since most other mutations in the mouse genetic resource are also on this background. thus, in future tests of phenotypic effects of different cmmb alleles within an allelic series, or when multiple mutations from the cmmb are combined with each other or with mutations from different sources into one line of mice to examine genetic interactions, we expect background effects to be minimal.

"off-target" mutations
an important consideration in any type of random mutagenesis screen is the impact that mutation load and "off-target" mutations will have on the ability to determine that a specific mutation of interest is solely responsible for the observed mutant phenotype. for this reason, we elected to treat c57bl/6j mice with a fractionated dose of enu  that is less than the dose that can be tolerated by this strain of mice  <cit> . the objective was to obtain a mutation load that was high enough to make screening efficient, but not so high that off-target mutations became a significant concern. assuming that all missense mutations we identified have the potential to produce a functional protein change, our estimate of functional mutation frequency in the oak ridge cmmb is  <dig> in  <dig>  mbp. also assuming a  <dig> -centimorgan  <dig> -gigabase-pair haploid mouse genome of which 3% is coding, each g <dig> male will have approximately  <dig> functional heterozygous mutations, with an average genetic distance between mutations of  <dig> centimorgans, or an average of  <dig> mutations per autosome. therefore, we can assume that nearly all of these mutations will segregate independently, and the likelihood of having tightly linked, off-target functional mutations that confound phenotype interpretation will be rare. even so, it is expected that g <dig> mice will inherit half of the mutations  from the g <dig> sperm, and that g <dig> mice will inherit half of these  from the g <dig> mice upon backcross to untreated c57bl/6j mice. only 25% of these  <dig> mutations  are expected to be present in both mice of a g <dig> intercross breeding pair. therefore, when g <dig> mice are intercrossed to produce  <dig> g <dig> mice for phenotype analysis, it is possible that  <dig> or  <dig> off-target mutations could become homozygous in a portion of these mice. however, a false association of the mutant phenotype with the target gene due to the co-segregation of an off-target mutation is extremely unlikely. such a false association would require that homozygosity for the off-target mutation be completely concordant with homozygosity for the target mutation. additionally, phenotype-genotype associations will be confirmed in offspring from multiple pairs of g <dig> mice, effectively eliminating the chance of an occurrence of co-homozygosity for an off-target mutation in all g <dig> target-mutation homozygotes. finally, and importantly, effects of off-target mutations can be ruled out by performing phenotype analysis in compound heterozygous mice in which the tgce-detected enu allele is in trans with a null mutation generated by homologous recombination in es cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the gene-driven mutagenesis approach presented here offers significant advantages in performing time- and cost-effective mutagenesis in mice, in screening for mutations in target genes, and in re-deriving mutant mice. only a single generation of mice was needed to make the cmmb, large numbers of g <dig> mice were generated and euthanized in a short time, and the cost of making the bank was a one-time investment. the design of the cmmb ensures that none of the mutations to be recovered from the bank are dominant lethals, since all of the heterozygous mutations were present in the g <dig> individuals used to make the bank. using the cmmb for mutation screening offers the advantage of screening for mutations in any target gene in the genome  using both dna and cdna templates, and recovering only those lines of mice with pre-selected mutations from the frozen sperm bank. the genes screened here were selected on the basis of their importance in different biological processes, but gene-driven enu-based mutagenesis will be especially useful for systems biology-based interrogations of distinct genetic pathways and networks. the primary advantages of tgce for mutation screening over other snp detection methods, such as denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, lie in its ability to detect mutations in unpurified, multiplexed pcr amplicons with different denaturation temperatures, without the need to predetermine the denaturation temperature for any amplicon. performing icsi with frozen sperm from the g <dig> mice in the cmmb provides numerous opportunities to recover live mutant mice from multiple different mutations that may occur in the same cryopreserved sperm sample, and also allowed us to make the entire bank on the widely used c57bl/6j reference genetic background. in the future, mutations in different genes may be crossed into one line of mice to better define protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, to observe effects of mutations in certain "sensitized" backgrounds, and to model multi-gene disease syndromes in humans without the effects of modifying genes introduced by different genetic backgrounds. thus, the generation of allelic series' of point mutations by gene-driven enu-induced mutagenesis in mice provides an important complement to knockout and conditional alleles in our quest to determine the whole-animal biological functions of all mammalian genes.
