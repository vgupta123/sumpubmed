BACKGROUND
today, lipases  stand amongst the most important biocatalysts. they carry out novel reactions in both aqueous and nonaqueous media. lipases are used to hydrolyze ester bonds of a variety of nonpolar substrates at high activity, chemo-, region- and stereo-selectivity. moreover, they are used to catalyze the reverse reactions  in nonpolar solvents  <cit>  and  <cit> .

among lipases of different sources, microbial thermostable lipases are highly advantageous for biotechnological applications, since they can be produced at low cost and exhibit improved stability  <cit> . thus, various thermostable lipase-producing microorganisms have been isolated from diverse habitats  <cit> .

bacterial lipases are mostly extracellular and their production greatly influenced by nutritional and physico-chemical factors, such as nitrogen and carbon sources, metal ions, initial ph, temperature, medium volume, agitation rate, incubation period, inoculum size and aeration  <cit>  and  <cit> .

the most important stages in a biological process are modeling and optimization to improve a system and increase the efficiency of the process without increasing the cost  <cit> . the classical optimization method  is not only time-consuming and tedious but also does not depict the complete effects of the parameters in the process and ignores the combined interactions between physicochemical parameters. this method can also lead to misinterpretation of results  <cit>  and  <cit> . in contrast, response surface methodology  is an empirical modeling system for developing, improving, and optimizing of complex processes  <cit>  and  <cit> . rsm assesses the relationships between the response and the independent variables  <cit> , and defines the effect of the independent variables, alone or in combination, in the processes.

although rsm has so many advantages, and has successfully been applied to study and optimize the enzymatic processes  <cit>  and  <cit> , and enzyme production from microorganisms  <cit>  and  <cit> , it is hard to say that it is applicable to all optimization and modeling studies  <cit> . the past decade has seen a host of data analysis tools based on biological phenomena develop into well-established modeling techniques, such as artificial intelligence and evolutionary computing. artificial neural networks  are now the most popular artificial learning tool in biotechnology, with a wide applications range included optimization of bioprocesses  <cit>  and enzyme production from microorganisms  <cit> .

indeed an ann is a massively interconnected network structure consisting of many simple processing elements capable of performing parallel computation for data processing. the fundamental processing element of anns  simulates the basic functions of biological neurons  <cit>  and  <cit> .

in this work, after finding the best composition of production medium among the best previously published and modified media, the optimization of physical factors for extracellular thermostable lipase production from a newly isolated geobacillus sp. strain arm  was carried out using rsm and ann.

RESULTS
effect of various production media on lipase production
the production of lipases is mostly inducer-dependent  <cit>  and different media have different stimulation effects on lipase production  <cit>  based on the physiological and biochemical pathways of the bacterium. in order to select the best lipase production medium, the ability of bacterium to produce lipase was tested in eight different liquid media . lipase activity in medium a <dig> was significantly higher than other production media, which is composed of peptone and yeast extract as organic nitrogen sources, olive oil as carbon source and lipase production inducer, sodium and calcium as metal ions, and gum arabic as emulsifier and lipase production inducer.

generally, microorganisms provide high yields of lipase when organic nitrogen sources are used, such as peptone and yeast extract, which have been used for lipase production by various thermophilic bacillus sp.  <cit>  and  <cit> . yeast extract is one of the most important nitrogen sources for high level lipase production by different microorganisms  <cit> . besides this role, yeast extract supplies vitamins and trace elements for the growth of bacteria and increases their lipase production  <cit> .

high levels of lipase production were reported from various thermophilic bacillus sp. in the presence of olive oil as carbon source in the culture medium  <cit>  and  <cit> . most published experimental data have shown that lipid carbon sources  stimulate lipase production  <cit>  and  <cit> , whereas carbon sources that are easily broken down and used by bacteria play an inhibitory role  <cit>  and  <cit> . different microorganisms have different requirement for metal ions. calcium ions play essential roles for many microbial species. they are important in maintaining cell wall rigidity, stabilizing oligomeric proteins and covalently bounding protein peptidoglycan complexes in the outer membrane  <cit> . lipase production by various bacillus sp. was stimulated in the presence of ca2+ alone  <cit>  and  <cit>  or in combination with other ions such as mg2+, and fe2+  <cit> .

on the other hand, highly branched, helically configurated, non-metabolizable polysaccharides such as gum arabic are able to enhance the lipase production. this might probably be due to the emulsification of culture media containing oil to increase the lipid surface  for lipase action, detachment of lipase from the oil surface, and from binding sites at the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  and  <cit> .

as a result, a <dig> production medium was chosen as the medium to be used in the further optimization of lipase production.

response surface methodology
fitting the data to various models  and their subsequent anova showed that all models were unable to explain the effects of physical factors on the lipase production. to overcome of this problem, we used backward elimination strategy followed by hierarchical terms addition to find the best model. backward elimination started with all of the predictors in the model. the variable that was least significant  was removed and the model was refitted. each subsequent step removed the least significant variable in the model until all remaining variables had individual p-values smaller than  <dig>   <cit> . finally, modified cubic equation  and its subsequent anova  showed a quite suitable model to optimize the lipase production. indeed, the modified model was a quadratic model with one eliminated  and one additional  terms.

where t is temperature, v is medium volume, is is inoculum size, ag is agitation rate, t is incubation period and ph is initial medium ph.

the computed model f-value of  <dig>  implies the model is significant and there is only a  <dig> % chance that a "model f-value" this large could occur due to noise. the 'lack of fit f-value" of  <dig>  implies the lack of fit is not significant relative to the pure error. there is a  <dig> % chance that a "lack of fit f-value" this large could occur due to noise. non-significant lack of fit shows the model is significant. on the other hand, the pure error is very low, indicating good reproducibility of the data obtained. with very small "model p-value"  and large "lack of fit p-value"  from the analysis of anova and a suitable coefficient of determination  and adjusted coefficient of determination , the modified cubic polynomial model was highly significant and sufficient to represent the actual relationship between the response and the significant variables .

artificial neural network
effect of architecture and topology on neural network performance
the selection of an optimal neural-network architecture and topology is of critical importance for a successful application. several neural-network architectures and topologies were tested for the estimation and prediction of lipase production. table  <dig> summarizes the top five ann models.

a incremental back propagation

b multilayer full feedforward

c multilayer normal feedforward

d hyperbolic tangent function

effect of learning algorithm and transfer function
training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models that minimizes the cost criterion. we have tested different learning algorithms for training neural network models. all accepted models  have shown that incremental back propagation  was the most suitable learning algorithm for prediction of lipase production .

the type of transfer function employed affects the neural network's learning rate and is instrumental in its performance. in the present work, among all employed transfer functions for hidden and output layers, accepted models were produced by linear function for output layer and gaussian function or hyperbolic tangent  for hidden layer that between them, the best models have been obtained by gaussian function.

optimal number of hidden neurons
although it is important to select the optimal number of hidden neurons carefully, depending on the type and complexity of the task, this usually has to be done by trial and error. an increase in the number of hidden neurons up to a point usually results in a better learning performance. too few hidden neurons limit the ability of the neural network to model the process, and too many may allow too much freedom for the weights to adjust and, thus, to result in learning the noise present in the database used in training  <cit> . we tested the effect of number of hidden neurons on the goodness of fit. the results of testing with the two sample experiments, evaluated statistically on the basis of the coefficient of determination , are shown in figure  <dig>  in both examined cases, the optimum number of hidden neurons was  <dig>  with an obvious overfitting when too many hidden neurons were used. then the 6-16- <dig> topology was chosen as the best topology for estimation of lipase production.

artificial neural network analysis of lipase production
the best ann chosen in the present work was a multilayer full feedforward incremental back propagation network with gaussian transfer function  that consisted of a 6-16- <dig> topology. the optimized values of network for learning rate and momentum were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the learning was completed in rmse =  <dig> e- <dig>  r =  <dig> and dc =  <dig>  in the case of training data set, the coefficient of determination  and absolute average deviation  were  <dig> and  <dig> %, respectively, whereas for the testing data set, r <dig> was  <dig> and aad was  <dig> %  and for validating data sets r <dig> and aad were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . comparison of predicted and experimental values in training, testing and validating data sets, not only revealed capability of ann in prediction of known data responses  but also showed the ability of generalization for unknown data  and implying that empirical models derived from ann can be used to adequately describe the relationship between the input factors and lipase production.

comparison of rsm and ann predicted values
the predicted output values of rsm and ann are shown in table  <dig>  though both models preformed well and offered stable responses, yet the ann based approach was better in both data fitting and estimation capabilities in comparison to the rsm.

main effects and interaction between parameters
the optimum level of each variable and the effect of their interactions on lipase production as a function of two variables were studied by plotting three dimensional response surface curves .

anova analysis  and three dimensional plots  reveal that growth temperature, medium volume, inoculum size and incubation period had significant effects on lipase production. anova analysis shows that although ph was not a significant parameter , it had important and significant interactions with other parameters, hence it has been used to develop the model. on the other hand, among the different interactions, interaction between agitation rate and growth volume, did not show significant effect on lipase production . figure 3b depicts that lipase activity effectively increased with a decrease in growth volume but agitation rate did not show significant effect on lipase production. on the other hand, anova analysis and figure 3d reveal, that agitation is one of the most important parameters for lipase production. as a conclusion, though both agitation rate and growth volume parameters are significant, yet their interaction is not a significant parameter for lipase production. hence modification of model via the removal of this interaction using backward elimination strategy improved the model .

at a suitable inoculum size, the nutrient and oxygen levels are enough for sufficient growth of bacteria and therefore, enhance the lipase production. if the inoculum size is too small, insufficient number of bacteria will lead to reduced amount of secreted lipase. high inoculum size can result in the lack of oxygen and nutrient depletion in the culture media  <cit>  and  <cit> .

figures 3b and 3c depict the medium volume-agitation rate and initial ph-agitation rate interactions respectively. these plots reveal that the lipase activity increased with a decrease in culture volume and agitation rate. the maximum lipase activity was obtained at  <dig> ml culture volume and moderately acidic ph , under static condition. similarly, static condition had resulted in comparatively high lipase production for syncephalastrum racemosum  <cit> pseudomonas sp. strain s <dig>  <cit>  and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . generally, suitable agitation lead to sufficient supply of dissolved oxygen in the media  <cit> . nutrient uptake by bacteria also will be increased  <cit> , but the degree of aeration appears to be critical in some cases since shallow layer  cultures  produced much more lipase than shake cultures   <cit> .

the medium volume may have a great effect on the enzyme production. although a larger medium volume initially contains more oxygen, nutrients and space for growth of bacteria, the void in the container and subsequently oxygenation of the medium will be decreased. on the other hand, it seems that ratio of surface area to volume  is important for lipase production where higher ratio cause higher oxygenation and lipase production  <cit> .

the combined effect of initial ph and incubation time on lipase production is shown in figure 3d. according to the plot, a moderately acidic initial ph  caused maximum lipase production after  <dig> h of cultivation. the activity was decreased remarkably as the incubation period changed. ph plays an important role in all the biological processes. the initial ph of the growth medium is important for lipase production  <cit> . most bacteria prefer neutral initial ph for the best growth and lipase production, such as thermophilic bacillus sp. strains l <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and  <cit> . maximum lipase activity at higher initial ph by various thermophilic bacillus sp. has also been reported  <cit>  and  <cit> . in contrast, ertugrul et al.  <cit>  have reported a moderately acidic ph  as the optimum initial ph for lipase production by bacillus sp. the molecular electric charges and consequently molecular interactions and functions are directly related to media ph, thus any changes in medium ph affects many biological functions such as enzymatic processes, signaling pathways and transportations of various components across the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall  <cit> . therefore, medium ph is very important in nutrients absorption and growth of bacteria, stimulation of enzyme production via signaling pathways and release of extracellular enzymes .

lipases are produced throughout bacterial growth, with peak production being obtained by late exponential growth phase  <cit> . therefore, the optimum incubation time is based on duration of log phase that is influenced by environmental conditions as well as by characteristics of the organism itself.

different optimum conditions for maximum lipase production by various thermophilic bacillus sp. were reported  <cit>  and  <cit> . strain differences and synergistic effects with other factors present in the medium might be responsible for differences in the obtained results. although no conclusive picture has been emerged so far from the large amount of experimental data concerning the physiology of lipase biosynthesis and its regulation, most of published experimental data seem to support the following inference. at the end of log phase, when one of the essential nutrients of the culture medium is used up or some waste product of organism builds up in the medium to an inhibitory level, microorganisms try to solve the problem and continue the growth. one response to this problem is the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases, proteases and amylases. in other words, limitation of growth can be an inducer for the production of some enzymes. on the other hand, table  <dig> shows that lipase production is the result of a synergistic combination of effective parameters interactions. these parameters are in equilibrium. it means that a change of one parameter can be compensated by changes of other parameters to give same results.

finally, figure  <dig> shows the importance percentage of effective parameters on the lipase production. inoculum size of  <dig> % is the most important factor on the lipase production, incubation period of  <dig> %, agitation rate of  <dig> %, growth temperature and medium volume of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, and ph of  <dig> % are subsequent degrees of importance.

optimization of reaction
the optimal conditions for lipase production were predicted as presented in table  <dig> along with their predicted and actual values. among the various optimum conditions, the highest lipase activity  was obtained at following conditions, growth temperature , medium volume , inoculum size , agitation rate , incubation period  and initial ph . attention to r <dig> and aad values between actual and estimated responses demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy of ann compared to rsm.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, different production media were tested for lipase production by a newly isolated thermophilic geobacillus sp. strain arm . the maximum production was obtained in presence of peptone and yeast extract as organic nitrogen sources, olive oil as carbon source and lipase production inducer, sodium and calcium as metal ions, and gum arabic as emulsifier and lipase production inducer. on the other hand, culture parameters optimization and estimation of lipase production using rsm and ann methods were successfully carried out. the best models were achieved by multilayer full feedforward incremental back propagation network and modified response surface model using backward elimination, where the optimum condition was: growth temperature , medium volume , inoculum size , agitation rate , incubation period  and initial ph . the experimental lipase activity was  <dig>  uml- <dig> at optimum condition , which compared well to maximum predicted values by ann  and rsm , whereas r <dig> and aad were determined as  <dig>  and  <dig> % for ann, and  <dig>  and  <dig> % for rsm respectively. though the modified response surface model was comparable to ann to provide good quality predictions for the six independent variables in terms of the lipase production, yet the ann showed a clear superiority over rsm as a modeling technique for data sets showing nonlinear relationships.

on the other hand, ann has the disadvantage of requiring large amounts of training data in comparison with rsm  <cit> . this problem was solved by using statistical experimental design, to reduce the number of experiments. some of other researchers also have employed this strategy. manohar and divakar  <cit>  employed a five variable parametric study for ann analysis. they used  <dig> different combinations for training of network. central composite design  was used for extracellular protease production   <cit>  and modeling the growth of a bacterium   <cit> . bas and boyaci  <cit>  employed face-centered design  and modified face-centered design  for ann study .

as a conclusion lipase production is the result of a synergistic combination of effective parameters interactions. these parameters are in equilibrium and the change of one parameter can be compensated by changes of other parameters to give the same results. in addition, ann can be a very powerful and flexible tool for modeling of the optimization process.
