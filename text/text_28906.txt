BACKGROUND
plants live in challenging environments in which they have to recognize different stress cues and initiate appropriate responses. the activation of stress-opposing genes is accomplished by the action of transcriptional regulators that alter gene expression patterns to favor the anti-stress program over other metabolic processes.

the three related class ii-tga transcription factors tga <dig>  tga <dig> and tga <dig> and their interacting transcriptional co-activator scarecrow-like   <dig> are required for the activation of genes of the detoxification program after plants encounter potentially harmful chemicals . moreover, these tga factors require the interacting redox-regulated regulatory protein npr <dig>  to activate the plant immune response “systemic acquired resistance”  <cit> .

in addition to interacting with transcriptional co-activators, tga factors directly interact with land-plant specific glutaredoxins  , also known as cc-type  <cit>  or class iii grxs  <cit> . class iii grxs differ from the well characterized class i and class ii grxs by their active site, which is ccxc/s rather than cpyc  or cgfs . like the canonical grxs, they might function as oxidoreductases or as iron-sulfur cluster  binding proteins  <cit> . the model plant arabidopsis thaliana encodes  <dig> class iii grx genes, which are named roxys  <cit> .

similar to the roxy gene family, the family of tga factors has expanded during evolution and specific members play distinct roles in development, metabolism and defense. examples for a functional connection between tgas and roxys have been found for each of these three processes. in development, roxy <dig> negatively regulates tga transcription factor perianthia  to control meristematic activity during floral organogenesis  <cit> . in microsporogenesis, roxy <dig> and roxy <dig> operate in one pathway with tga factors tga <dig> and tga <dig>  <cit> . in nitrate metabolism, a functional connection between roxy <dig> to roxy <dig> with tga <dig> and tga <dig> seems likely  <cit> . finally, ten of the  <dig> tested roxys interfere with transcriptional activation of the master regulator of an important anti-microbial defense pathway, ora <dig>  <cit> . this defense pathway is activated by the stress hormones jasmonic acid  and ethylene  and contributes to fending off necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . the ora <dig> promoter contains an essential tga binding site  which is occupied in vivo by class ii-tga factors  <cit> . by interfering with ora <dig> expression, ectopically expressed roxy <dig> blocks the activation of ja/et-induced defense processes and confers higher susceptibility to the necrotrophic pathogen botrytis cinerea  <cit> . since roxy <dig> is induced at the transcriptional level by the defense hormone salicylic acid , it was suggested to be responsible for the conserved negative effect of sa on the ja/et pathway  <cit> .

in this study, we addressed the question whether other yet unknown processes are influenced by roxy <dig>  due to the potential redundancy of members of the large roxy gene family, we deployed transgenic plants expressing roxy <dig> under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s  promoter. we took an unbiased approach and analysed the transcriptomes of unchallenged whole seedlings. gene ontology  term and motif mapper analysis of the negatively regulated genes revealed that tga-dependent genes potentially involved in the detoxification of reactive chemicals were repressed by roxy <dig>  consistently, 35s:roxy <dig> plants are more susceptible to the halogenated electrophilic xenobiotic tiba.

RESULTS
microarray analysis identified novel genes regulated by roxy19
in order to identify further genes whose expression can be influenced by roxy <dig>  we performed microarray analysis of two independent transgenic plant lines  expressing roxy <dig> under the control of the camv 35s promoter. we chose axenically grown seedlings rather than soil-grown plants for this analysis in order to reduce the variability that comes with fluctuations in the environment. moreover, roots could be harvested along with the shoot without any stressful treatments during the up-rooting process. we included rna from transgenic plants expressing a putatively non-functional roxy <dig> in which the conserved ccmc motif was mutated to ssms . in parallel, rna from a transgenic line expressing class i grxc <dig> , which does not interact with tga factors  <cit> , was analysed. all proteins were n-terminally fused to an ha-tag and expression of similar amounts of protein in each line was confirmed by western blot analysis . untransformed col- <dig> plants and the four transgenic plant lines were grown on vertically oriented agar plates and 2-week-old seedlings  were harvested for rna extraction. the experiment was repeated four times with independently grown plant material.fig.  <dig>

in order to get a first impression of the global structure of the dataset of our microarray investigation, we performed a principal component analysis  which typically results in clusters of samples with a similar expression pattern . the samples from col- <dig> and transgenic 35s:roxy19ssms plants did not show a clear separation indicating that the roxy19ssms protein does not strongly alter the transcriptome. in contrast, the clusters representing the two independent 35s:roxy <dig> lines overlapped and were separated from the col- <dig> and 35s:roxy19ssms clusters. these results provide evidence for the requirement of a functional active site during transcriptional regulation by roxy <dig>  the data set derived from the 35s:grxc <dig> plants was also clearly distinct from the data set obtained from the 35s:roxy <dig> plants indicating a specific function of roxy <dig> as opposed to a potential general function associated with glutaredoxins.

to visualize and cluster the relative transcript levels of all those genes that are differentially expressed  < <dig>  or > <dig> , p <  <dig> ) in at least one of the four transgenic lines when compared to col- <dig>  we applied the marvis software . this program groups genes with similar relative expression levels into prototypes and color-codes the relative expression levels in the five genotypes. for example, prototype  <dig> comprises genes that are up-regulated in all transgenic lines. importantly, prototypes  <dig> and  <dig> contain those genes that are less expressed only in the two 35s:roxy <dig> lines and not in the two other transgenic lines. prototype  <dig> contains  <dig> genes that are up-regulated only in the two 35s:roxy <dig> lines.

in summary, this analysis shows a robust negative effect of roxy <dig> on target genes in both transgenic lines, which is consistent with its known repressive function on promoters driven by or containing a functional as- <dig> element  <cit> . up-regulated genes do not show such a consistent clustering in the two 35s:roxy <dig> lines. this might indicate that positive effects on gene expression are more indirect and thus more subject to fluctuations. therefore, we mainly focused on the down-regulated genes. since the repressive effect seemed stronger in line # <dig>  the following analysis was done with the  <dig> transcripts  down-regulated in these plants.

tga binding sites are enriched in promoters that are repressed by roxy19
next, we tested whether binding sites for transcription factors are over- or under-represented in the promoters of differentially expressed genes. to this end, the 1-kb sequences upstream of the predicted transcriptional start sites were scanned using the motif mapper cis element analysis tool . the program determines the average number of specific binding sites in a given group of genes that is randomly  selected from the whole genome. this average frequency is compared with the actual number of binding sites within the group of roxy19-regulated genes. strikingly, the tgacg motif, which represents more than a half site of the perfect tga binding site tgacgtca  <cit>  and which is recognized by tga <dig>  <cit> , is present in  <dig> promoters belonging to the  <dig> less abundant transcripts in line # <dig>  this motif is enriched by a factor of  <dig>  . the tgacgt motif, which covers 6 bps of the palindrome, is present in  <dig> promoters and enriched by a factor of  <dig> . the perfect palindrome tgacgtca  <cit>  is enriched even  <dig> -fold, although only present in  <dig> of the down-regulated promoters. table  <dig> presents all the motifs which we identified as being enriched after applying the following three criteria. first, the motif should be present in at least 10 % of the promoters of the differentially expressed genes; second the motif should be enriched by at least  <dig> -fold; third, the p-value should be  <dig>  in addition to the tgacg and the tgacgt motifs, variants of the a box  and the c box  were identified. binding of tga factors  to a boxes tacgta and c boxes  was shown before  <cit> . moreover, the a box overlaps with the preferred binding site of ataf-type nac factors . notably, transcript levels of ataf <dig> and anac <dig>  which have been shown before to be regulated by the scl14/tga complex  <cit> , are reduced in both transgenic lines ectopically expressing roxy <dig> . thus, the over-representation of the a box might reflect that ataf1/nac032-dependent promoters are indirectly affected by roxy <dig> table  <dig> promoter elements enriched in promoters affected in 35s:roxy <dig> plants

analysis of the promoters of the up-regulated genes revealed that at-rich sequences resembling a tata box are enriched . in addition, the sequence catgcay, which represents a ry motif that is recognized by b3-domain transcription factors  <cit>  is present with an enhanced frequency in the up-regulated promoters.

plants ectopically expressing roxy <dig> are more susceptible to xenobiotic stress
in order to identify the function of the target genes of roxy <dig>  we subjected the differentially expressed genes to gene ontology  over-representation analysis . only go terms encompassing more than 5 % of the genes were considered. the go-terms “response to stimulus”, “response to stress” and “defense response” were significantly enriched, irrespective of whether the up-regulated or the down-regulated genes were analysed . in contrast, only members of the group of down-regulated genes were enriched within the go domain “molecular function”. here, the go term “catalytic activity” and its sub-go terms “oxidoreductase activity” , “glycosyl transferase activity”, “udp-glycosyltransferase activity” and “hexosyl transferase activity”  were enriched. moreover, the go term “transmembrane transporter”  was over-represented. thus, the go term enrichment analysis suggests that ectopically expressed roxy <dig> suppresses the detoxification response.fig.  <dig> xgene ontology  over-representation analysis of genes which show enhanced  or reduced  expression in 35s:roxy <dig>  plants. black bars indicate the percentage of genes of each go term found within the group of all annotated genes of the arabidopsis genome. gray bars indicate the percentage of genes of each go term found within the subgroup of differentially regulated genes. only go terms encompassing more than  <dig> genes  are shown



the tga-dependent detoxification pathway is induced by chemicals like the xenobiotic tiba , the allelochemical boa -one  <cit> ), the safeners isoxadifen-ethyl and mefenpyr-diethyl  <cit>  and phytoprostanes  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that at least a fraction of the roxy19-repressed genes should be induced by these chemicals. therefore, we analysed the expression levels of the  <dig> down-regulated transcripts  in mock-treated and tiba-treated plants. to this aim, we deployed a data set obtained from a previously conducted microarray analysis. since the microarray was performed with the ath <dig> gene chip, we only obtained expression data for  <dig> genes affected by roxy <dig>  indeed,  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes were induced by tiba after 8 h .

next we tested the repressive capacity of roxy <dig> on selected target genes using quantitative reverse transcription -pcr analysis. we chose cyp81d <dig>  opr   <dig> and anac <dig> for this analysis, since these genes were  strongly repressed in 35s:roxy <dig> lines,  induced by tiba , and  less induced in the tiba-treated tga <dig> tga <dig> tga <dig> mutant . moreover, all three genes are related to the detoxification program: cyp81d <dig>  <cit>  might play a role in detoxification of the oxylipin 9-hot , opr <dig>  <cit>  in detoxification of the explosive tnt  and network analysis has identified anac <dig> as a central activator of detoxification genes  <cit> . all three genes were only barely inducible in soil-grown 35s:roxy <dig> plants whereas roxy19ssms allowed wild-type-like transcript levels upon tiba treatment . this documents that roxy <dig> exerts its negative effect not only in axenically grown plantlets. using primers directed against the endogenous roxy <dig> transcripts, we reproduced previous findings that ectopically expressed roxy <dig> represses its own gene  <cit> . moreover, the experiment confirmed publicly available expression data  and our microarray analysis that roxy <dig> is induced by tiba.fig.  <dig>

given the overlap of roxy19-repressed genes with tiba-induced genes and the results of the go term analysis, we tested whether plants ectopically expressing roxy <dig> would be more susceptible to tiba. to this aim, seedlings were grown on 50 μm tiba . as observed before for the tga <dig> tga <dig> tga <dig> triple mutant  <cit> , 35s:roxy <dig> seedlings were more impaired in their growth and showed stronger signs of bleaching than wild-type plants and the two 35s:roxy19ssms lines. this effect was also detected with soil-grown plants, albeit the phenotypic differences were less evident . therefore, all subsequent tiba-susceptibility assays were performed with plants grown on plates.

the ccmc active site can be changed to cpyc in roxy19
next, we mutated the conserved ccmc motif of roxy <dig> into a cpyc motif that is found in class i grxs. two transgenic lines expressing the roxy19cpyc protein to similar levels as those found in the previously characterized transgenic line # <dig> and one line expressing lower amounts were selected for further analysis . the two highly expressing lines showed reduced expression of cyp81d <dig>  after tiba treatment which correlated with higher susceptibility to tiba . in contrast, line # <dig> with lower roxy19cpyc protein levels showed only slightly reduced cyp81d <dig> expression and wild-type-like sensitivity of the growth phenotype on tiba-containing ms plates . it is concluded that the repression mechanism requires an active site, but not precisely the characteristic ccmc motif.fig.  <dig>

the detoxification pathway is not hyper-induced in the roxy <dig> mutant
microarray analysis of mock- and tiba-treated plants had revealed that only the expression of roxy <dig>  is induced by tiba. moreover, our studies have shown that roxy <dig> can negatively affect the expression of tiba-induced detoxification genes. these results suggest that endogenous roxy <dig> might counteract the activation process through a negative feedback loop. therefore, we tested whether target genes of roxy <dig> would be expressed to higher levels in a roxy <dig> knock-out mutant and whether the mutant plants would be more resistant to tiba. since no t-dna insertion line is available in the col- <dig> ecotype, we deployed the transposon-tagged line roxy19ds  in which the ds element is inserted 45 bps upstream of the roxy <dig> start codon. this insertion interferes with roxy <dig> mrna accumulation as demonstrated by qrt-pcr analysis of rna collected from wild-type and mutant seedlings . still, tiba-induced cyp81d <dig> transcript levels were indistinguishable between wild-type and the mutant . moreover, the sensitivity towards tiba remained unchanged .fig.  <dig>

in order to address the question whether other roxys might act redundantly with roxy <dig>  we tested transgenic plants expressing roxy <dig> , which is the closest relative to roxy <dig>  <cit> . ectopic expression of roxy <dig> to the same levels than roxy <dig> resulted in similar increased susceptibility to tiba .

the single cysteine in class ii tga factors does not affect its biological activity
since tga factors interact with roxy-type grxs it may be speculated that roxys regulate tga factor activity through modulating their redox state. class ii tga factors encode a single conserved cysteine within the domain c-terminal to the bzip domain. in order to analyse whether the redox state of this cysteine might be of functional relevance, we complemented the tga <dig> tga <dig> tga <dig> triple mutant with either wild-type tga <dig> or a tga <dig> mutant protein that encodes a serine rather than a cysteine residue at amino acid position  <dig> . expression of the transgene was verified by western blot analysis with an antiserum that recognizes tga <dig>  tga <dig> and tga <dig>  with the exception of 35s:tga <dig> line # <dig>  transgenic lines accumulated higher levels of tga protein than col- <dig> . in spite of these different degrees of gene expression, all four lines complemented the increased tiba susceptibility of the tga <dig> tga <dig> tga <dig> triple mutant with similar efficiencies . however, the complementing tga <dig> constructs did not fully restore tiba-induced cyp81d <dig> expression. this phenomenon was independent of whether the tga factor was mutated or not. expression was also not altered in mock-treated samples .fig.  <dig>

discussion
roxy <dig> belongs to a 21-membered gene family of proteins which are classified as glutaredoxins. roxy <dig> was found in a modified yeast screen using bzip transcription factor tga <dig> bound to the tgacgt motif as a bait  <cit> . ectopically expressed roxy <dig> represses the ja/et pathway by interfering with the expression of the transcriptional master regulator ora <dig>  <cit> . since tga factors bind in vivo to the ora <dig> promoter  <cit> , it was speculated that roxy <dig> is recruited to the promoter through its interaction with tga factors. indeed, direct recruitment of roxy <dig> to its own tga-regulated promoter was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis  <cit> .

in this study, we asked the question whether roxy <dig> can target further promoters. to this end, transgenic plants ectopically expressing ha-tagged roxy <dig> were subjected to microarray analysis. consistent with the idea that roxy <dig> negatively regulates class ii tga factors, genes containing tgacgt motifs in their promoter regions were repressed. go term analysis revealed that roxy19-down-regulated genes might serve to detoxify reactive chemicals. this assumption is derived from the observation that genes representing catalytic activities typical for the three phases of the detoxification process  <cit>  are over-represented. first, oxidoreductases might reduce carbonyl to hydroxyl groups in the first phase, which serves to activate compounds for conjugation processes in phase  <dig>  indeed,  glucosyl-transferases were over-represented. in phase  <dig>  these compounds are transported to the vacuole or the apoplast. consistently, transmembrane transporters were also enriched in the set of genes that are less well expressed in 35s:roxy <dig> plants. the impaired growth of 35s:roxy <dig> plants on tiba-containing ms plates/1 % sucrose can be explained by the reduced expression of these genes. however, it is very likely that further target genes can be identified by analyzing the transcriptomes of soil-grown plants either treated with a combination of those signals that induce roxy <dig> expression like treatment with sa, ja, sa/ja, or sodium chloride  or infection with pathogens.

based on the phenotype of the 35s:roxy <dig> lines, it was expected that the detoxification pathway might be hyper-activated in roxy19ds plants. however, expression of target genes of roxy <dig> was not altered. since the mutant was generated in the nossen background and since the transposon insertion is upstream of the atg start codon, results may not yet be conclusive. therefore, studies with a roxy <dig> allele in the columbia background, which have become feasible with the advent of the crispr-cas-mediated genome editing technology, have to be awaited.

still, potential redundancy of other roxys has to be taken into account especially in consideration of the increased tiba-susceptibility of 35s:roxy <dig> plants. likewise, expression of a number of roxys under the roxy <dig> promoter can restore the wild-type flower phenotype in the roxy <dig> background  <cit> . moreover, at least  <dig> roxys can repress the ora <dig> promoter in transient assays  <cit> . in both experimental systems, all functional roxys encode a conserved alwl motif at their very c-terminal end. therefore, the hypothesis was put forward that roxys might principally operate through the same mechanism and that their specific expression pattern determines when and where they become functional. this concept seems likely for reproductive tissues, where the expression of developmental genes in specific cell types follows a fine-tuned protocol. however, in differentiated leaves, several roxys are constitutively expressed . thus, tiba-induced expression of roxy <dig> should only slightly increase the amount of potentially redundant roxys.

we therefore do not claim a specific role for roxy <dig> but rather hypothesize that basal levels of redundant roxys might repress the detoxification pathway in the absence of a toxic compound , similar to the repressive activities of redundant jasmonate zim-domain  proteins in the absence of ja  <cit> . xenobiotic chemicals would inactivate roxys through post-transcriptional  modifications. to reconcile this hypothesis with the constitutive repressive capacity of ectopically expressed roxy <dig> and roxy <dig>  we have to postulate that the inactivation might involve a mechanism that is not effective if the pool of roxys is too large. roxy <dig> inhibits own expression as well as the expression of roxy <dig> . this suggests that the expression levels of these proteins have to be tightly controlled since abnormally high expression levels might lead to permanent repression. given that regulatory circuits are often interwoven, it might even be that roxys can interfere with the inactivation mechanism. these assumptions would explain the strong and permanent repressive capacity of ectopically expressed roxy <dig>  this hypothesis might be challenged by higher order mutants or transgenic lines expressing a dominant negative roxy protein.fig.  <dig> model of the role of roxys as repressors of the detoxification pathway. we postulate that redundant roxys bind to class ii tga factors at the promoters of detoxification genes repressing their activation by scl <dig>  <cit>  or other transcriptional co-activators. upon tiba treatment, the repressive capacity of roxys is abolished allowing activation of gene expression. this inactivation might be incomplete in plants expressing high amounts of roxys. since control of gene expression is often subject to autoregulatory mechanisms, newly synthesized roxys including tiba-induced roxy <dig> might negatively regulate the inactivation mechanism in order to turn off the response. ectopic expression of repressive roxys might interfere with this intricate mechanisms leading to permanent repression



furthermore, we observed that roxy <dig> interferes with tga-regulated processes if the active site is ccmc or cpyc. however, mutating the site into an ssms sequence abrogated its function. thus, either oxidoreductase activity or assembly of an iron sulfur  cluster might be important for repression. until now, biochemical analyses are only available for a his-tagged cc-type grx from poplar in which the hydrophobic alwl motif at the c terminus had been replaced by the c-terminal amino acids of poplar class i grxc <dig>  <cit> . absorption peaks of the recombinant protein measured at  <dig> and 415 nm indicated the association with a 2fe-2s cluster. however, the protein had poor enzymatic activity with the artificial substrate 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide. whether tga factors are redox-modified by roxys has remained an open question. roxy <dig> requires the first cysteine of the ccmc active site to complement the roxy <dig> phenotype  <cit> . in addition, the tga transcription factor pan cannot complement the pan flower phenotype if a critical cysteine residue is mutated into serine  <cit> . this might indicate that the oxidized version of pan is the active protein and that roxy <dig> interferes with its function by catalyzing the reduction. in the case of class ii tga factors, we found that the pseudo-reduced protein tga5c186s was still functional: the target genes cyp81d <dig> was repressed in the absence of tiba and activated to wild-type-like levels in the presence of tiba. therefore, we consider it unlikely that the redox state of tga factors is crucial with respect to the regulation of the detoxification pathway.

since the cpyc sequence does not compromise the ability of roxy <dig> to repress tga-regulated genes, the importance of the ccmc sequence has remained elusive. one hypothesis is that the ccmc motif is important for the relief of the repressive activities.

CONCLUSIONS
glutaredoxins are of major importance for sensing the redox state of cells and relaying the signal to a wide variety of metabolic and regulatory processes. in the evolution of higher plants, particularly the cc-type grxs have undergone a major expansion resulting in large gene families such as the 21-membered roxy family in arabidopsis. while the biochemical and molecular functions of cc-type grxs are still largely unknown, a functional link with tga transcription factors in the regulation of reproductive organ development, nitrate metabolism and defense pathways has been established. we have identified the detoxification pathway as another process roxy proteins may be involved in. both, roxy <dig> and roxy <dig> have the potential to negatively regulate tga-dependent expression of genes characteristic for the three phases of the detoxification process. these findings further emphasize the close functional relation between roxy proteins and tga transcription factors. furthermore, we have shown that the cysteines in the active site of roxy <dig> are required for this function. this suggests that in this context roxy <dig> may function as an oxidoreductase, which, however, very likely does not act on class ii tga factors. identification of potential targets of roxy-mediated redox modification will be a matter of future research.
