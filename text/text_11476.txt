BACKGROUND
the chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular pathogens that undergo a unique biphasic developmental cycle involving the inter-conversion between the extracellular infectious elementary body and the intracellular, replicative reticulate body. chlamydia 'chlamydophila' pneumoniae is probably one of the most successful chlamydial species, having established a niche in a range of warm-blooded  and cold-blooded  hosts, including humans, horses, marsupials, frogs and reptiles  <cit> . c. pneumoniae human infections are associated with bronchitis, pharyngitis, community-acquired pneumonia and more recently chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and stroke  <cit>  myocarditis  <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit>  and alzheimer's disease  <cit> .

australia's native icon, the koala , is found throughout australia's north-eastern and southern eucalypt regions and is commonly infected with chlamydiae  <cit> . while the decline in koala populations has largely been the result of hunting and a diminished habitat, there is great concern for the koala due to an increased incidence of disease  <cit> . it is estimated that almost all of the nations free-range koala populations and many in captive populations are affected by c. pneumoniae and/or c. pecorum . c. pneumoniae-infected koalas may develop a respiratory illness similar to that in humans with clinical signs of sneezing, coughing, nasal discharge and chest congestion  <cit> . c. pneumoniae koala is not restricted to the respiratory tract and has been isolated from ocular and urogenital tract sites , although disease at these sites is poorly understood  <cit> .

exposure to c. pneumoniae is widespread due to effective aerosol transmission and outbreaks have been reported in humans  <cit> , horses  <cit> , frogs  <cit>  and koalas  <cit> . however, the original source of infection remains undetermined. myers et al.  <cit>  recently published the full  <dig>  mbp genome sequence of the c. pneumoniae koala lpcoln isolate, the first analysis of a c. pneumoniae genome from a non-human host species. this study revealed that the five c. pneumoniae genomes were highly similar in genomic organisation and gene order, although some notable differences were observed  <cit> . in contrast to the highly conserved human-derived isolates, a relatively high number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, snps  differentiated koala lpcoln from human ar <dig>  <cit> . in the proposed phylogeny , which encompassed all five c. pneumoniae genomes and five sequenced animal chlamydial genomes , koala lpcoln was basal to the c. pneumoniae human isolates .

in the present report we perform a comparative analysis of the whole koala lpcoln genome sequence, highlighting the components that distinguish the strain isolated from the koala , from those isolated from humans. these comparisons point to candidates of strain-specific adaptations and may provide potential targets for improved diagnostic tests, therapeutic intervention and epidemiological investigations.

RESULTS
we used a comparative genomics approach to identify genetic characteristics that were either unique to c. pneumoniae or were commonly shared with chlamydial species and other organisms. overall, we analysed a total of  <dig> genes for key similarities and differences between human and animal strains of c. pneumoniae . we chose to use our c. pneumoniae animal genome as the reference genome and compared the available human genomes to it.

chlamydia pneumoniae-specific genes
using tblastx and tblastn, we searched other genomes for orthologs of the genes identified from individual gene-by-gene comparisons of the five c. pneumoniae genomes. the comparative approach identified  <dig> genes that were specific to c. pneumoniae and for which no significant similarity was detected in any other organism . many of these species-specific genes are short open reading frames  that have been annotated as genes. the large number of short hypothetical orfs makes it difficult to determine whether these genes are 'real' or artefacts of the genome annotation or sequencing process. until these proteins are systematically studied in the future, it cannot be determined whether these proteins are valid or too short to be protein-coding genes. genes with suggested or predicted functions include putative lipoproteins and chlamydial inclusion membrane proteins . several hypothetical proteins are clustered together , suggesting that they may exist in an operon and might be functionally related.

genes with a demonstrated role in chlamydial biology and/or pathogenicity
one of the most striking differences between the c. pneumoniae koala and human genomes were changes associated with the polymorphic membrane proteins . like c. pneumoniae of human origin  <cit> , koala lpcoln is predicted to encode  <dig> pmps that are phylogenetically related to one of six basic subtypes   <cit> . the organisation of the pmp loci of koala lpcoln is conserved relative to the c. pneumoniae human isolates. however, where the four human isolates carry several interrupted pmp genes , koala lpcoln carries uninterrupted, full-length versions of the same genes, including pmpg <dig>  pmpg <dig> and pmpe <dig> . a global comparison of all pmp sequences reveals a total of  <dig> snps  differentiating koala lpcoln from the four c. pneumoniae human isolates, with the highest percentage of snps observed in pmpe <dig>  and pmpe <dig> . in addition to snps, several strain-specific  indels  were evident in pmpb, pmpe <dig>  pmpg <dig>  pmpg <dig>  pmpg <dig>  pmpg <dig>  pmpg <dig>  and pmpg <dig> . interestingly, the pmpg <dig> pseudogene is interrupted by a stop codon in all five strains albeit at different sites: lpcoln carries a seven nt indel  at nt position  <dig>  resulting in a taa stop codon at nt position  <dig>  while the four human isolates have a snp  at nt  <dig>  resulting in a taa stop codon . previous analyses of human isolates have revealed variable numbers of  <dig> nt tandem repeat segments in pmpg <dig>  including two repeats in ar <dig>  <cit>  and j <dig>  <cit> , and three repeats in tw <dig>  and cwl <dig>  <cit> . the lpcoln genome carries three variable tandem repeats in pmpg <dig> 

type iii secretion  occurs independently of the sec pathway and requires assembly of a secretion apparatus composed of approximately  <dig> proteins. however, in this analysis we looked at more than just the apparatus proteins; we also examined potential secreted proteins and chaperone proteins involved in t3s. additional file  <dig> compares  <dig> proteins from lpcoln to putative orthologs of other chlamydial species. ten apparatus-encoding genes , which were either annotated as such and/or found to be homologous to previously studied proteins in other chlamydial spp. were examined. genetic comparisons indicate ≥  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity between each koala lpcoln t3s apparatus gene and orthologs from the human isolates. similarly, comparisons of genes which were annotated as, or are similar to, chaperone-encoding genes that assist in the folding of effectors demonstrated high conservation with ≥  <dig> % sequence identity to the equivalent genes in the c. pneumoniae isolates from humans.

nine putative effector-encoding genes  of c. pneumoniae koala lpcoln were compared to their counterparts in the human isolates. as with the t3s apparatus proteins, all koala lpcoln effectors exhibited ≥  <dig> % sequence identity with their human isolate counterparts .

the plasticity zone or replication termination region is a hypervariable region that is linked to genetic differences in chlamydial pathogen-host relationships. the membrane attack complex/perforin  of the plasticity zone is one such protein that showed varied degrees of polymorphism among the chlamydial species. there was a significant length polymorphism differentiating the macpf of c. pneumoniae koala  from all four human isolates which encode a predicted defective macpf separately incorporated into two orfs, cp_ <dig>  and cp_ <dig>  . a comparison with other chlamydial species showed that a c. pneumoniae ancestor separated from other 'chlamydophila spp.' before the large indel was removed from the human isolates. similar to the c. pneumoniae koala lpcoln macpf, c. trachomatis serovar, a/har, b/jali20/ot, d/uq-3/cx, l2b/uch-1/proctititis, l2/434/bu and c. muridarum nigg isolates had a full-length version , while variations of the macpf were observed in c. abortus s26/ <dig>  c. caviae gpic and c. felis fe/c- <dig> isolates , which showed frame disruptions . protochlamydia amoebophila uwe <dig> did not have any detectable macpf orthologs. motifscans of the chlamydial macpf  revealed an mir  motif, suggestive of a possible ligand transferase function. the size variation of the c. pneumoniae macpf may serve as a useful marker in future genetic investigation. for example, the macpf gene sequence may potentially differentiate c. pneumoniae animal isolates from c. pneumoniae human isolates.

genes involved in nucleotide salvaging pathways or amino acid biosynthesis
all sequenced chlamydial genomes to date encode a ctp synthetase, the enzyme that converts utp to ctp, and an atp/adp translocase  <cit> . however, comparative genomic analysis suggests that multiple modifications have occurred in nucleotide salvage pathways during the course of chlamydial evolution, as revealed by the variable presence of udk , pyre , guab , guaa  and add  in different isolates .

tph, tryptophan hydroxylase; trp, tryptophan biosynthesis; kynu, kynureninase; prsa, ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase; gua, purine biosynthesis; add, adenosine deaminase; udk, uridine kinase; pyre, ump synthase; upp, uracil phosphororibosyl transferase. * asterisk indicates remnants.

c. pneumoniae is the only chlamydial species to have a udk gene for ump production. our examination of the c. pneumoniae sequence revealed that the 3' end of the gene was unique to the species. no significant sequence similarity was observed in other organisms between nt regions 541- <dig>  indicating that this region might be specific for c. pneumoniae. a sequence alignment of the full-length udk gene identified only three snps  differentiating koala lpcoln from the sequenced human isolates.

the bacterial pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway includes several enzymes for the conversion of ump into ctp. however, all chlamydial genomes thus far lack the genes for most of the pathway with the exception of the last few steps . c. pneumoniae of koala and human origins, c. felis, c. caviae and c. abortus have the pyre gene, encoding an orotate phosphoribosyl transferase involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. however, the final step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is via orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase  and this gene is missing from all chlamydial genomes.

the purine biosynthesis pathway is also incomplete, similar to the pyrimidine pathway, with many genes variably missing in the chlamydial genomes . the only four genes that are absent from the koala lpcoln genome but are present in the human genomes include cp_ <dig>  which encodes a hypothetical protein, guab , guaa  and add , which are involved in purine ribonucleotide biosynthesis. the guaa and add sequences of the c. pneumoniae human isolates were identical, while guab fragmentation was evident in tw <dig>  cwl <dig> and j <dig> isolates with a deleted  <dig> nt at the 5' end of the sequence . the cp_ <dig> gene resides next to this guaba-add cluster , which may indicate that this gene may also be involved in purine biosynthesis.

the tryptophan biosynthesis operon is missing from several chlamydial species including c. muridarum nigg, c. abortus s26/ <dig>  and c. pneumoniae of both koala and human origin . despite this absence, c. pneumoniae koala and human encode a functional aromatic amino acid  hydroxylase, although the koala lpcoln isolate is missing the extended n-terminal region  <cit> . while variations in c. pneumoniae tyrp  copy numbers have been found between human isolates  <cit> , we report that koala lpcoln, a respiratory isolate, has a single copy of tyrp. a comparison of the tyrp sequence from all five sequenced  c. pneumoniae isolates revealed that the sequence was highly conserved across the seven copies of tyrp, revealing only nine snps including seven unique to koala lpcoln, four of which led to an amino acid change. previously, gieffers et al.  <cit>  published a tyrp-specific snp profile of  <dig> c. pneumoniae human isolates, and here we report the snp profile of two additional respiratory isolates j <dig>  and lpcoln .

extrachromosomal elements of the chlamydiaceae
extrachromosomal plasmid sequences pcpnko from c. pneumoniae koala lpcoln  <cit> , pcpne <dig> from c. pneumoniae horse n <dig>  <cit> , pcpa <dig> from c. psittaci avian n <dig> , pcfe <dig> from c. felis feline fe/c- <dig>  <cit> , pcpgp <dig> from c. caviae guinea pig gpic  <cit> , pmopn from c. muridarum mouse nigg  <cit> , and pcta, pjali, psw <dig> and plvg <dig> from c. trachomatis human serovars a  <cit> , b  <cit> , e  <cit>  and l <dig>  <cit> , respectively, were compared for their overall synteny and relationship . these plasmids each contain eight major open reading frames  designated orf1- <dig>  although the plasmid sequences vary in size , alignment of their amino acid sequences revealed a high degree of similarity and large conserved regions . the pcpnko and pcpne <dig> plasmid sequences share  <dig> % identity and are more closely related to pcpa <dig> , pcpgp <dig>  and pcfe <dig>  than with pmopn , pcta, pjali, psw <dig> and plvg <dig>  . overall, there were approximately  <dig> indels among the species; three of the longest indels were identified in orf <dig> of pcpne <dig> , pcfe <dig>  and psw <dig> . a phylogenetic tree was inferred from multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequence . three main branches  were evident:  c. pneumoniae lpcoln and n16;  c. psittaci n <dig>  c. felis fe/c- <dig> and c. caviae gpic;  c. muridarum and c. trachomatis isolates.

the bacteriophage is another strain-specific extrachromosomal element reported in chlamydial species. in c. pneumoniae, ar <dig> is the only human genome to have an extrachromosomal bacteriophage   <cit> , whereas the koala lpcoln genome showed remnants of a phage. the first remnant of a phage in the koala lpcoln genome was evident in cpk_orf <dig>  a  <dig> nt incomplete orf that is presumably defective, sharing approximately 79% similarity  to the partial-length of the human ar <dig> phage. cpk_orf <dig> also shares 97% similarity  to the chp <dig> remnant , which is present in the four c. pneumoniae human genomes. this suggests earlier integration of the phage genome in the c. pneumoniae genome . the second koala lpcoln phage remnant was a  <dig> nt orf, termed cpk_orf <dig>  which appears to be 'intact', sharing approximately 77% similarity  to the human ar <dig> phage. the koala lpcoln phage remnants are positioned between hypothetical genes in the genome and there appear to be no further remnants of the phage within this region of the genome. a comparison of the c. pneumoniae koala lpcoln phage with other chlamydial species revealed approximately 77-79% sequence identity to partial-length sequences of the c. psittaci chp <dig> phage, c. pecorum phage  <dig>  c. caviae phicpg <dig> phage and c. abortus chp <dig> phage.

discussion
in this work, we applied computational analyses to explore the genome content and genetic diversity among the recently sequenced c. pneumoniae koala lpcoln genome and previously published c. pneumoniae human genomes . the koala lpcoln genome is larger than all four c. pneumoniae human genomes by 10- <dig> kbp. we combined blast search methods and motif analysis for use in elucidating the relationship between gene function and evolution. even though these techniques have several limitations  <cit> , our comparative approach has  identified genome plasticity,  provided circumstantial evidence for the presumed direction of c. pneumoniae evolution, and  suggested targets for detection and differentiation of c. pneumoniae isolates from both human and animal origins.

the presence of unique insertions/deletions is evidence of evolution in action. for the majority of these genes, the c. pneumoniae koala genome has the full-length version. these length polymorphisms suggest that the presumed functional changes are brought about by adaptation to a specialised niche, where the ancestral gene function may no longer be required. therefore, it is important to understand how these genetic differences may influence differences in pathogenicity and fitness in the host. our data supports the findings of rattei et al.  <cit>  and the whole genome findings of myers et al.  <cit>  in that the essentially clonal human isolates have evolved from an animal strain that has adapted to humans through fragmentation, decay and loss-of-function processes whereby the activity of the gene product may be reduced or specialised. hence, the koala lpcoln genome seems to be an 'older' strain in this sense. in addition, we provide new information on strain diversity and have identified targets for detection and further investigation.

our analysis revealed a total of  <dig> genes that were specific to c. pneumoniae. one hundred and twenty-three of these represented hypothetical genes with no significant similarity to genes in other organisms present in the database. further analysis of these hypothetical genes  may reveal undiscovered biovars or subspecies in c. pneumoniae.

the pmp family is characterised by an unusual degree of sequence polymorphism, including mutations and large indels across all species  <cit>  and showed variation within c. penumoniae. this suggests that the pmp gene family is subjected to high selective pressure , correlating with a relatively faster evolutionary rate for these antigens. taken together, the polymorphism of pmp sequences in c. pneumoniae from humans and animals is dually consistent with the divergent evolution of the pmp genes under host-specific selection while maintaining the capacity to adapt to specific niches or immune responses in the two different hosts.

in light of the variation seen between other families of genes and their orthologs in the human isolates, namely the pmp protein family, the strict conservation of t3s effector genes was initially surprising given the effectors' normal tendency for divergence. while the differences observed between other regions of the genomes are consistent with evolutionary changes  <cit> , the relative conservation of effector genes over equivalent time suggest that changes in genes encoding effector proteins were likely selected against. this is consistent with a key role of t3s effectors in mediating steps of the biology of c. pneumoniae that are conserved in human and animal strains, such as inclusion and intracellular development. overall, these results support a critical role for t3s less in the virulence than in the developmental biology of these organisms. such a role has been proposed in the context of the contact-dependent t3s-mediated hypothesis of chlamydial development proposed earlier  <cit> .

orthologs of the macpf were identified in several chlamydial species. the first biological characterisation of the c. trachomatis macpf by taylor et al.  <cit>  has revealed that the macpf  might be activated by proteolytic processing and may play a role in the acquisition or modification of host-derived lipids. by contrast, studies of the macpf in other organisms, including that of toxoplasma spp. have shown that ablation of the macpf  resulted in a reduction in virulence , whereby tgplp <dig> deficient parasites were unable to exit normally and were entrapped within host cells, due to the inability to permeabilise the parasitophorous vacuole membrane  <cit> . if the chlamydial macpf was to play a similar role in egression or virulence, then why have several species failed to retain this gene? non-lytic family members have also been identified in other organisms including astrotactin involved in neural migration in mammals  <cit> , a drosophila torso-like protein involved in embryonic development  <cit>  and plu-macpf of photorhabdus luminescens which binds to the surface of insect cells  <cit> . further investigation of this gene should provide more insight into its role in chlamydiaceae.

c. pneumoniae is the only chlamydial species thus far to have a udk gene encoding uridine kinase. the udk gene is a pyrimidine ribonucleoside kinase that phosphorylates uridine and cytidine into uridine or cytidine monophosphate   <cit> , and is highly conserved in the species. it has been reported that the prevotella bryantii genome encodes a putative uracil dna glycosylase and uridine kinase, likely to be involved in the removal of misincorporated uracil from dna and its subsequent re-use  <cit> . all chlamydial genomes also encode a uracil dna glycosylase, however, c. pneumoniae is the only species carrying the udk ortholog. this implies that an alternative gene product is involved in ump production in the other chlamydial species. the c. muridarum genome includes a cds  encoding a uracil phosphoribosyltransferase  <cit>  that may represent the main pathway for ump production in this species. c. pneumoniae is unusual in having a very broad host range and therefore the fact that it is the only chlamydial species to have retained the udk gene could reflect this broad host capacity.

most bacteria can salvage or synthesise their own purines and pyrimidines. by contrast, chlamydiae and rickettsiae  are incapable of de novo synthesis, and to a degree, of salvage  <cit> . given the absence of genes for enzymes upstream in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, it is unclear why the pyre should be retained. the final step in the pathway is via pyrf which is absent from the chlamydial genome, suggesting that they are unable to convert orotate to ump. the presence in all chlamydial genomes of orthologs encoding the three downstream enzymes involved in ump to ctp conversion and the earlier demonstration of ctp synthetase activity in these organisms  <cit>  confirm that chlamydiae are not auxotrophic for ctp. furthermore, a three-gene cluster including guab, guaa and add have been selectively maintained in several chlamydial species including c. pneumoniae ar <dig>  cwl <dig>  tw <dig> and j <dig>  c. felis fe/c- <dig>  c. caviae gpic and c. muridarum nigg. c. abortus has a guab pseudogene, whereas the c. pneumoniae lpcoln and c. trachomatis serovar a/har, b/jali20/ot, d/uq-3/cx, l2b/uch-1/proctititis, l2/434/bu and candidatus protochlamydia amoebophila uwe <dig> genomes lack all three genes  <cit> . the selective loss of guaba-add from c. pneumoniae koala lpcoln and other chlamydial species suggest that these three enzymes required for inter-conversion of gmp, imp and amp must be acquired by other means or are clearly not essential for species survival.

copy number variations of the tyrp  gene have been suggested to reflect vascular tropism and pathogenicity among c. pneumoniae human isolates with multiple copies associated with respiratory infection and single copy more frequently associated with vascular tropism  <cit> . a comparison of the five sequenced c. pneumoniae genomes also revealed variations in the tyrp  copy number that are, however, inconsistent with the hypothesis by gieffers et al.  <cit> . among these, two respiratory isolates   <cit> , as well as the single conjunctival isolate  of the group  have a single tyrp copy while two other respiratory isolates   <cit>  carry duplicate copies of tyrp.

the loss and fragmentation of pre-existing genes during evolution is one of the primary distinguishing features between c. pneumoniae koala and c. pneumoniae human. extrachromosomal plasmids have been identified in six of the nine chlamydial species. as the plasmid is not common to c. pneumoniae, it is not known why koala lpcoln has a plasmid.

while proteins with predicted or known biologic function are favoured candidate gene targets, many c. pneumoniae-specific hypothetical proteins with no predicted function were identified in the comparisons and may be worth further investigating for their potential role in host tropism, pathogenicity and niche adaptation . a suggested list of target genes for c. pneumoniae detection and a brief description of their characteristics is summarised in additional file  <dig>  selected genes include  c. pneumoniae-specific genes for detection of c. pneumoniae,  genes that could potentially differentiate isolates from human and animal origins, for example, length polymorphic genes including the membrane attack complex perforin and the hypothetical protein cpk_orf <dig>   genes for the identification of a c. pneumoniae plasmid.

CONCLUSIONS
the study of whole genome sequences provides important clues to the natural history of c. pneumoniae and their hosts, and assists in the identification of functional differences that may determine pathogenicity and virulence differences between the strains. previously, whole genome comparisons have focused on four practically clonal c. pneumoniae human genomes, which make the identification of target genes for strain differentiation quite challenging. in this study we have made use of the recently sequenced koala lpcoln genome, which is the largest and most unique c. pneumoniae genome sequenced thus far, in order to select target genes that represented traits of strain-specific determinants. further investigation of these genes in other host species may provide additional clues as to what enables this pathogen to:  present varied clinical pathologies,  occupy multiple niches, and  establish an infection in cold and warm-blooded hosts. moreover, these genes may become targets for improved diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.
