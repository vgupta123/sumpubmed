BACKGROUND
the ability of some fungal species of the genus trichoderma to suppress disease and stimulate the growth and development of plants explains the wide and long-term use of these organisms in many crops  <cit> . traditionally, the beneficial effects of trichoderma spp. on plants have been attributed to their capability to antagonize soil-borne pathogens by a combination of mycoparasitism, secretion of antibiotics, and competition for space and substrates  <cit> . however, subsequent discoveries have demonstrated that these biocontrol agents are also able to interact intimately with plant roots, even colonizing the outer epidermis layers, and to act as opportunistic, avirulent plant symbionts  <cit> . currently, it is known that the root colonization by trichoderma spp. produces changes in plant metabolism that can lead to increased root development, crop productivity, and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> .

in recent years, increased attention has been paid to studying the direct interactions occurring between trichoderma spp. and plants, including molecular studies of specific bioactive components produced by the fungal partner that have been associated with plant defence mechanism elicitation, root colonization, or plant growth promotion  <cit> . novel genomic and proteomic techniques are also now being implemented to trichoderma biocontrol species with the aim of identifying large-scale molecular factors involved in the communication between trichoderma and plants. macroarray analyses have been applied to study the gene expression of four species of trichoderma during their interaction with cacao seedlings  <cit> , and of t. harzianum during the early colonization of tomato roots  <cit> . there is also a study based on a three-way interaction system  that used a proteomic approach to identify differential proteins produced by each of the three organisms involved in that association  <cit> . apart from this, several recent works on plant-trichoderma interactions have been conducted to explore the molecular responses of plants to the presence of a root-colonizing trichoderma strain, using either transcriptomic  <cit>  or proteomic methods  <cit> .

microarray analyses are becoming a powerful tool for large-scale gene expression studies in filamentous fungi  <cit> . however, transcriptomic analyses of trichoderma biocontrol species using this technology have been hampered by the scant sequencing conducted on these fungi. in fact, the first analysis of the genome sequence of a trichoderma strain  has been recently published  <cit> , although this sequence has been publicly available for a few years. fortunately, the first version of the complete genome from two other trichoderma species, the biocontrol agents t. virens gv29- <dig> and t. atroviride imi  <dig>  is now available on-line  <cit> . since the complete genomes of other trichoderma biocontrol species are not available and nor will they be in the near future, in this work we focused our efforts on developing a customized high-density oligonucleotide  microarray from a large expressed sequence tag  collection, which was generated in a previous eu-funded project called "trichoest"  <cit> . this project has provided a fundamental resource for transcriptomic analyses in trichoderma spp. through the sequencing of more than  <dig>  ests from eight different species representing the biodiversity of this genus: t. harzianum, t. atroviride, t. asperellum, t. viride, t. longibrachiatum, t. virens, t. stromaticum and t. aggresivum. specifically, these ests were obtained from  <dig> cdna libraries under a wide range of growth conditions, including biocontrol-related conditions and different nutritional situations  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to explore transcriptomic changes in the biocontrol strain t. harzianum cect  <dig> in its early interactions with tomato plant roots using microarray technology. we report the construction of a trichoderma hdo microarray composed of  <dig>  25-mer probes designed against  <dig>  est-derived transcripts from twelve strains belonging to the eight trichoderma species cited above, and  <dig>  genome-derived transcripts from t. reseei  <cit> , since it was the only entire trichoderma genome available when the microarray was designed. as far as we know, this is the first time that an oligonucleotide microarray has been used to study gene expression changes of a trichoderma strain in the presence of a plant host. rnas from t. harzianum cect  <dig> mycelia cultured in the presence and absence of tomato plants and also in glucose- or chitin-containing media were hybridized to the trichoderma hdo microarray proposed in this work.

RESULTS
trichoderma hdo microarray design
the probe selection process conducted as described in methods yielded a total of  <dig>  different probes  that were included on our custom-designed trichoderma hdo microarray. after mapping these individual probes to the initial collections of est-derived transcripts of twelve trichoderma strains and genome-derived transcripts of t. reesei, from which the probes were designed, it was found that approximately 35% of the probes on the chip matched transcripts from trichoderma spp. and about 65% matched transcripts from t. reesei, which was consistent with the size in base-pairs of each of the two sequence collections . moreover,  <dig> % of the probes on the chip could be mapped to sequences from both databases. the number of probes associated with each particular transcript sequence  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for trichoderma spp. transcripts, and from  <dig> to  <dig>  for t. reesei transcripts, with a median value of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and a maximum of approximately  <dig> nt between adjacent probes . the final composition of the microarray in terms of the number of transcript sequences of each trichoderma strain represented by a probe set is shown in figure  <dig>  in all, of the original  <dig>  est-derived sequences of trichoderma spp. and  <dig>  genome-derived sequences of t. reesei, only  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were not represented on the microarray since no probe passed the selection procedure .

overview of expression data in t. harzianum from microarray analysis
trichoderma hdo microarrays were hybridized with cdna obtained from t. harzianum cect  <dig> after  <dig> h of culture in the presence of tomato plants , chitin , glucose , or ms basal medium . from the fluorescence intensities processed as described in methods, a multi-class sam test identified a total of  <dig>  probe sets  revealing significant expression changes  between any of the culture conditions under study. of these probe sets, about 51% had been generated from transcript sequences of t. harzianum cect  <dig>  and the remaining 49% from transcript sequences of other strains of trichoderma, including 12% of the probe sets from t. reesei. the expression data obtained and the identification codes of the corresponding transcript sequences are available as supplementary material in additional file  <dig>  more specifically, we observed that the majority  of the detected probe sets exhibited a more than two-fold expression change  in one or more culture conditions as compared with the control condition . in particular,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> probe sets displayed expression levels at least two-fold higher or lower in ms-p, ms-ch and ms-g, respectively, than in ms . in order to determine probe sets specifically related to the presence of tomato plants, we compared those that were common and those that were not common to each culture condition . regarding the probe sets reflecting a two-fold higher expression in the presence of tomato plants  than in ms,  <dig> of them  were also found in ms-g and/or ms-ch, resulting in  <dig> probe sets  that were unique to ms-p. among the probe sets displaying a two-fold lower expression in ms-p than in ms,  <dig>  were shared with other culture conditions and  <dig>  were unique to ms-p.

to gain a general view of the expression data obtained in these microarray experiments, we generated a heat map from the  <dig>  probe sets that showed two-fold expression changes in at least one experimental condition vs. the ms control condition. hierarchical clustering was carried out using kendall's tau test and ward's clustering algorithm since this method resulted in the best resolution of two distinct main clusters, i and ii, illustrating different expression patterns . as shown in figure  <dig>  the two biological replicates of each experimental condition were clustered together. globally, the majority of the probe sets in the heat map would correspond to genes that are up-regulated by glucose  and relatively weakly induced or repressed in the presence of tomato plants and/or chitin . in contrast, probe sets in subclusters ia and ib would represent genes that are down-regulated in the presence of glucose but up-regulated in response to tomato plants  or chitin . finally, a subcluster ic would comprise genes induced by tomato plants and to a certain extent by glucose.

as internal controls of the expression data obtained and the cluster analysis, we searched for probe sets representing genes of t. harzianum cect  <dig>  such as those coding for trypsins -pra <dig>  and p <dig>  - and subtilisins -p <dig>   and p <dig>  -, which have been reported to be strongly induced by chitin and repressed by glucose at short-term  <cit> . as expected, all six probe sets associated with these genes were located in subcluster ib and yielded expression profiles  consistent with those published previously. additionally, from the microarray data it was found that these genes exhibited a relatively low level of expression when the fungus was cultured in the presence of tomato plants as compared to that observed when it was cultured in chitin-containing medium. this was also supported by northern blot analyses carried out for the trypsin pra <dig> and subtilisin prb <dig> genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  the transcription of pra <dig> was only weakly triggered in ms-p, whereas the transcript levels of prb <dig> were not even detectable under this condition.

identification of t. harzianum genes expressed in response to tomato plants
since we were interested in identifying the genes induced in t. harzianum cect  <dig> by the presence of tomato plants, we selected the  <dig> probe sets affording significant differential expression in ms-p vs. ms , and the corresponding transcript sequences were annotated according to the go classification and the hierarchical structure using the blast2go suite  <cit> . go categories were assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences examined  whereas another  <dig> had no results after mapping or annotation processes , and the remaining  <dig> sequences did not yield significant hits in the databases. as summarized in additional file  <dig>  the annotated sequences represented a total of  <dig> different genes. additionally, three sequences without blast2go annotation  but corresponding to three portions of the known protein qid <dig>  of t. harzianum cect  <dig> were also included in additional file  <dig> 

within the genes identified as showing up-regulation in ms-p vs. ms, about 45% were genes encoding homologues of proteins involved in metabolic pathways, mainly enzymes for carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism, but also enzymes for vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis, and energy- and detoxification- related processes. interestingly, some of these up-regulated genes  were classified according to blast2go in the functional category "growth or development of symbiont on or near host surface" since their homologues in magnaporte grisea were differentially expressed during appresorium formation  <cit> . proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism included several enzymes of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways plus a phosphoketolase of the pentose phosphate pathway, and a  <dig> -beta-glucan synthase involved in cell wall biosynthesis. the three up-regulated genes with homologues in lipid metabolism corresponded to a phosphatidylserine synthase participating in phospholipid biosynthesis; a dihydroxyacetone kinase involved in glycerolipid metabolism, and an acid sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, responsible for breaking sphingomyelin down into phosphocholine and ceramide. proteins related to amino acid metabolism included the enzymes acetylornithine aminotransferase, involved in the urea cycle and the metabolism of amino groups, and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which catalyzes the third reaction in the catabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine.

in addition to metabolic genes, we also observed the up-regulated expression in ms-p vs. ms of genes involved in signalling, transcription, translation, and post-translational modification and protein folding, including the ph signalling transcription factor pac <dig>  from t. harzianum cect  <dig> . as shown in additional file  <dig>  genes with homologues in cellular transport and cytoskeleton and cell wall organization were also induced in t. harzianum mycelium in the presence of tomato plants.

interestingly, a homologue of the protein sm1/elp <dig>  which is an elicitor of systemic resistance in plants produced by t. virens/t. atroviride  <cit> , was also found to be induced in t. harzianum co-cultured with tomato plants in comparison with the control condition, supporting a role for this gene in the t. harzianum-tomato plant interaction. unexpectedly, some mycoparasitism-associated genes described in the t. harzianum cect  <dig> strain, such as those encoding the secreted endochitinase chit <dig> , trypsin-like protease pra <dig> , aspartic protease p <dig>  and the cell wall protein qid <dig>   <cit> , were also significantly up-regulated in the interaction with tomato plants in the absence of phytopathogenic fungi . northern blot analysis of these genes showed that p <dig> and qid <dig> were strongly expressed in ms-p, while the transcript levels of chit <dig> and pra <dig> were high in ms-ch but were scarcely or not detected in ms-p . these results are not surprising, considering that the up-regulated expression of chit <dig> and pra <dig> vs. the ms control condition estimated from the microarray hybridizations  resulted from extremely low expression values in this condition .

discussion
this study was undertaken with the dual purpose of constructing an hdo microarray for species of trichoderma, taking advantage of an est collection previously generated plus the publicly available genome of t. reesei  <cit> , and applying this tool for the first time to explore the transcriptional response of a t. harzianum biocontrol strain under early  trichoderma-plant interaction conditions. other previous approaches at transcriptional level have used macroarray technology to study the interaction of trichoderma spp. with the seedling roots of cacao  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . however, the number of cdna clones represented on these macroarrays - <dig> in the trichoderma spp.-cacao interaction and  <dig>  in the t. harzianum-tomato interaction- was much more limited compared with the high capacity, as well as the high reproducibility and sensitivity, of hdo microarrays  <cit> . foreman et al.  <cit>  used oligonucleotide microarrays  to study the transcriptional regulation of biomass-degrading enzymes from t. reesei, a trichoderma sp. of significance in the cellulose industry. in another study, the transcriptome of t. atroviride was analyzed using spotted microarrays  but again not for the purpose of biocontrol  <cit> .

the analysis reported here is based in a hdo microarray carrying probe sets representative of a total of  <dig>  gene transcripts from thirteen trichoderma strains, including  <dig>  est-based transcripts of the t. harzianum cect  <dig> biocontrol strain . despite the redundant nature of est libraries, a substantial representation of the t. harzianum cect  <dig> transcriptome can be expected from the probe sets included on the hdo microarray for this strain, considering that already sequenced trichoderma genomes have been estimated to contain  <dig> - <dig>  predicted genes  <cit> . moreover, as shown in this work probe sets on the microarray designed from transcripts of trichoderma strains other than t. harzianum cect  <dig> were also useful for obtaining information about gene expression in our strain. in particular, we found that nearly half of the probe sets revealing significant expression changes after hybridization with cdna from t. harzianum cect  <dig>  derived from other strains or species of trichoderma. the fact that genes known to respond rapidly and sharply to chitin, including those encoding the proteases pra <dig>  pra <dig>  prb <dig> and prb <dig> and the endochitinase chit <dig>  <cit> , yielded the expected expression patterns, and that a homologue of the sm <dig> gene with demonstrated expression in the first stages of t. virens-root interactions  <cit>  was also detected in our t. harzianum-root interaction system, provide a high level of confidence that the microarrays identify differentially expressed genes. we are convinced that at present the trichoderma hdo microarray proposed here offers the opportunity for extensive analyses of gene expression in trichoderma strains whose whole genomes are not scheduled to be sequenced soon, such as those of t. harzianum, t. asperellum or t. viride. an improved microarray may now be possible for t. virens and t. atroviride, thanks to the release of their genome sequences and the availability of higher-density microarrays that ensure the coverage of complete genomes. for example, gene expression profiling based on entire genome tiling arrays will afford the possibility of monitoring the expression level of whole transcriptomes, avoiding the cloning biases of ests and allowing the data arising from different transcript variants that may not have been previously known or predicted to be distinguished. furthermore, the introduction of new emerging technologies such as massive-scale rna sequencing will in the near future enable us to overcome some of the limitations inherent to microarray-technology  <cit> .

according to the overall transcriptional profiles, our microarray data showed that changes in gene expression in t. harzianum cect  <dig> were more striking  when the fungus was cultured in glucose than with plant roots or with chitin as compared to minimal medium ms, at least at the time examined . moreover, the total number of probe sets that exhibited a minimum of two-fold, up- or down-, regulation in glucose was also considerably higher  than in the presence of tomato plants , and this in turn was higher than in chitin-containing medium , with 57% , 38% , and 18%  of the probe sets, respectively, not shared among culture conditions, and hence probably representing genes specifically involved in each particular condition. globally, the microarray results obtained indicate that t. harzianum uses transcriptional controls during its growth in glucose that differ from those occurring in minimal medium  to a greater extent than they do when the fungus grows on tomato roots and even more when it is grown in a medium containing chitin as the sole carbon source, which could be reasonably correlated with the availability of nutrients to the fungus in each of the culture media. thus, the larger number of probes sets up-regulated by glucose relative to minimal medium in comparison to other conditions  is consistent with the extensive metabolic activity expected for a filamentous fungus growing in a rich medium with an easily assimilable substrate  <cit> .

the forty-seven distinct genes identified from probe sets whose expression was at least two-fold induced in t. harzianum during co-culture with tomato plants  extend the number of previously published induced genes/proteins in trichoderma biocontrol strains during plant colonization to a considerable extent. nine differential proteins were identified by marra et al.  <cit>  in t. atroviride under in vitro interaction conditions with bean plants, using a proteomic approach; using macroarray analysis, chacón et al.  <cit>  described sixteen induced genes in t. harzianum interacting with tomato plant roots; and several more genes have been studied individually, such as those coding for two aspartyl proteases , a hyprophobin  and an expansin-like protein  from t. asperellum, a mitogen-activated protein kinase  from t. virens/t. asperellum, and a hydrophobin-like protein  belonging to the cerato-platanin family and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  from t. virens  <cit> . we found that many of the genes induced in t. harzianum mycelium in contact with tomato plant roots fell within go categories related to metabolism, including anabolic and catabolic activities, which indicates an active adaptation of the fungus to the rhizosphere. six of these genes showed similarities to genes expressed during the formation of infection structures in the phytopathogenic fungus m. grisea  <cit> , such as a glycosyl hydrolase belonging to family  <dig> , which was also up-regulated in mycelium of t. hamatum and t. ovalisporum interacting with cacao seedlings  <cit> ; an aldose 1-epimerase , which is responsible for the anomeric interconversion of d-glucose and other aldoses during normal aldose metabolism  <cit>  and is related to the fungal gal <dig> protein, involved in galactose metabolism in h. jecorina  <cit> ; a dihydroxyacetone kinase, which uses atp as a source of high-energy phosphate to produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a biochemical compound mainly involved in the glycolytic pathway and lipid biosynthesis; a sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, a major enzyme for the production of ceramide in response to cellular stresses  <cit>  that also contributes to polarized hyphal growth in aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> , and a gtp cyclohydrolase i, which participates in the production of tetrahydrofolate, in turn involved in nucleic acid and methionine synthesis, and also of tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor essential for the synthesis of hydroxy-amino acids, including auxin-related amino acids such as 5-hydroxytryptophan, as well as for the synthesis of nitric oxide . auxins are important plant regulators involved in many growth and behavioural processes, including those activated by trichoderma spp.  <cit> . additionally, no is a wide-spread signalling molecule related to a number of critical signal transduction pathways in mammals and plants, and it has also been reported to have a regulatory effect in photoconidiation and conidial germination in fungi  <cit> . another up-regulated gene that suggests that t. harzianum could produce no during the first stages of its interaction with tomato plants is that coding for an acetylornithine aminotransferase, which is a pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzyme involved in arginine biosynthesis. l-arginine is important for protein biosynthesis but also participates in the synthesis of no. in the filamentous fungus coniothyrium minitans, it has been recently found that arginine is essential for conidiation, possibly through a no-mediated process  <cit> .

another ten identified genes induced in t. harzianum by the presence of tomato plants also pointed to the active growth and development of the fungus, among them, those encoding homologues of two d-lactate dehydrogenases, which modulate the flow of pyruvate when glucose is required for cell growth or hyphal development  <cit> ; a glucan synthase, which is a key enzyme for fungal cell wall biosynthesis  <cit>  and whose up-regulation is correlated with the previous proteomic study performed by marra et al.  <cit>  showing increased expression of a cell wall synthesis-associated chitin synthase in t. atroviride during interaction with bean leaves; a phosphatidylserine synthase, which is known to participate in cell-membrane building through the cdp-diacylglycerol metabolic process  <cit> ; a 4-hydroxyphenylpiruvate dioxigenase, which has been found to be directly involved in the growth and differentiation of the pathogenic phase of the fungus paracoccidioides brasiliensis  <cit> ; a formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase, which participates in small-molecule metabolism and the synthesis of dna and has been described to be related to early stages of microbial symbiotic relations to plants  <cit> ; a pentatricopeptide repeat  protein belonging to the ppr protein family that includes proteins involved in rna post-transcriptional processing and development  <cit> ; and a class ii hydrophobin from t. virens   <cit> . trichoderma hydrophobins are known to play major roles in hyphal development and conidiation  <cit> , and it has also been reported recently that the hydrophobin tashyd <dig> from t. asperellum participates in cucumber root colonization  <cit>  and that a hydrophobin of t. atroviride was induced during interaction with bean roots  <cit> .

another gene related to adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces with up-regulated expression in t. harzianum in response to growth on tomato plant roots was qid <dig>  this gene, which encodes a cell wall protein described in t. harzianum cect  <dig>  <cit> , has been proposed to participate in cell adherence and cell wall protection against toxins produced by fungal hosts during mycoparasitic interactions  <cit> , and our expression results support a role for this protein in the trichoderma-plant interaction. apart from qid <dig>  the significant up-regulation detected by microarrays of some other known genes of t. harzianum cect  <dig>  such as those encoding secreted enzymes associated with the breakdown of fungal cell wall components during trichoderma-fungal host interactions  and the transcription factor pac <dig> , indicates that they could also participate during early stages of the trichoderma-plant interaction. these data match the hypothesis suggested by woo et al.  <cit>  that among the trichoderma elicitors that activate plant defence responses are some of the proteins, such as chitinases and glucanases, that the fungus uses for its mycoparasitic activities.

the increased expression in t. harzianum-tomato plant co-cultures of a nitropropane dioxygenase gene, which has been related to fungal defence against toxic nitroalkanes produced by plants  <cit> , suggests that t. harzianum is able to protect itself from harmful plant substances. some other up-regulated genes that may also be related to detoxification processes were those encoding a dimethylaniline monooxygenase, which is a broad spectrum flavoprotein that accepts diverse substrates, including plant alkaloids  <cit> ; a rta- <dig> domain protein belonging to the rta <dig> family, which is comprised of fungal proteins involved in resistance to toxic substances  <cit> ; and a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme, which could be involved in the consumption of the cytotoxic formaldehyde resulting from many demethylation reactions  <cit> .

finally, it is worth noting that those non-identified transcripts that were detected in this study as up-regulated in t. harzianum by the presence of tomato plants  are also an additional resource for future research on trichoderma-plant interactions, especially those that did not respond significantly to other culture conditions assessed.

CONCLUSIONS
the trichoderma hdo microarray presented here has enabled us to define a gene set probably involved in the transcriptional response of the fungus t. harzianum cect  <dig> within the first hours of contact with tomato plant roots. many of the genes identified had not been previously related to trichoderma-plant interactions, including those respsonsible for the possible biosynthesis of nitric oxide, xenobiotic detoxification, micoparasitic activities, mycelium development, or those related to the formation of infection structures in plant tissues, which can provide new insight into the mechanisms and roles of this fungus in the trichoderma-plant interaction. the effectiveness of the trichoderma hdo microarray in the detection of different gene responses in t. harzianum under different growth conditions strongly indicates that this tool should be useful for further assays addressing different stages of plant colonization, as well as for expression studies in other trichoderma spp. represented on it.
