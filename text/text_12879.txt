BACKGROUND
growth of the skull is a complex process that combines genetic and environmental information to establish and mineralize the individual bony elements that come together to protect and support the rapidly expanding soft tissues of the head, such as the brain  <cit> . the well-ordered activity of specific transcription factors regulated by a range of developmental regulatory signals marks the differentiation of osteoblast lineage cells during the ossification process  <cit> . among those signaling systems that pattern growth and assembly of the skull are fibroblast growth factors  and their receptors  whose essential role during development is largely known through the study of missense mutations that cause congenital skeletal diseases including craniosynostosis, achondrodysplasia, and syndromes with dysregulated phosphate metabolism  <cit> . apert syndrome  is caused by gain-of-function mutations in fgfr <dig>  over 99% of which are amino acid substitutions in ser252trp  or pro253arg   <cit> . apert syndrome is characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures , midfacial retrusion, and additional complex cranial, neural, limb, and visceral malformations with cognitive ability varying widely, from normal to severely deficient  <cit> . fgfr <dig> is widely expressed throughout development: therefore changes in the development of many tissues caused by these mutations can be observed during embryogenesis, fetal development, at birth, and post-natally  <cit> .

the cranial sutures are major growth sites  <cit>  whose fusion occurs either upon completion of early, intense cranial growth or later in life. when sutures close prematurely, specific cranial dysmorphology ensues due in part to the incapacity for growth perpendicular to the closed suture. mutations that cause premature suture closure occur in genes that are widely expressed throughout development . these mutations can affect growth and development of diverse tissues  <cit>  as the changes in cell signaling initiated by fgfr mutations are not specific to suture mesenchyme and are unrelenting  <cit> , continuing to affect cellular processes and tissue-tissue interactions from conception onwards. research focused on molecular pathophysiology of premature suture closure has provided much needed information about changes occurring at the subcellular and cellular level local to the suture mesenchyme, but has yet to sufficiently elucidate how these changes translate into the production of more broadly based structural and functional defects.

in recent years, the study of growth and development of skeletal tissue has centered on the study of the genetic control of the temporal sequence of changing osteoprogenitor cell function  providing a baseline understanding of the genetic control of these processes . however morphogenesis of skeletal structure occurs via interactions between cells in multiple tissue layers, including physical forces produced by skeletal and soft tissues that can trigger gene expression to regulate gene function and cell fate. we have previously used precise 3d measures of bone volume, relative bone mineral density, and skull morphology as a guide towards identification of the cellular mechanisms responsible for localized differences between mice carrying particular fgfr <dig> mutations and their unaffected littermates thereby linking particular aspects of dysmorphogenesis to specific cellular behaviors  <cit> . we have also shown that mutations thought primarily to affect cells of one type  can have equally profound effects on cells that make up other tissues   <cit> , thereby contributing to tissue-level behaviors of morphological development. advancing our knowledge of the physical aspects of development requires specification of the direction and magnitude of changes required to take an initial morphology to a target shape. once these architectural details are known, they can become part of a larger model of computational tissue biomechanics that more closely specifies the complement of inputs that contribute to the genetic regulation of development and growth. when quantitatively defined in 3d, growth patterns can be integrated into models used to predict mutation-specific craniofacial phenotypes, to test the veracity of therapeutic agents, or to plan surgical correction.

prenatal cranial growth patterns are not typically assessed in humans and because nearly all craniosynostosis patients undergo reconstructive surgery during infancy, mouse models offer a valuable resource for addressing the contribution of growth pattern to craniofacial dysmorphogenesis. the premature closure of cranial vault sutures is thought to contribute to late prenatal and postnatal dysmorphogenesis, but the precise interaction of the mutation-driven changes in cellular processes, premature closure of sutures, and growth pattern is not well understood. here we provide a comparative analysis of craniofacial suture closure and growth pattern in two mouse models for apert syndrome, each carrying a mutation in fgfr <dig> that together account for 99% of all known cases of apert syndrome. we test the hypothesis that cranial growth patterns contribute to cranial dysmorphology in craniosynostosis and demonstrate that differences in a single mutation change in neighboring amino acids cause subtle differences in patterns of skull growth. we quantitatively estimate late prenatal cranial growth patterns and provide a timeline of cranial suture patency patterns using high resolution micro computed tomography  images of the heads of fgfr2

e <dig> . a principal components analysis  of form based on all  <dig> unique inter-landmark distances estimated from  <dig> global skull landmarks , was used as an exploratory first step in describing and comparing cranial morphologies and growth trajectories  <cit> . a plot of the first two principal components of e <dig>  mice reveals that cranial morphologies of fgfr2
+/s252w
and fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice overlap along the first principal component axis   and the second axis   . the distribution of mutant cranial forms indicates similarity in the generalized effects of the two mutations on skull shape at e <dig> , although fgfr2
+/s252w
 cranial morphologies gravitate farther towards the positive ends of pc <dig> and pc <dig>  the distribution of the fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice along pc <dig> and pc <dig> suggests increased variation for this mutation group at this age. a clear separation between fgfr2

and fgfr2
+/p253r
 apert syndrome mice and their unaffected littermates is seen along pc <dig>  cranial morphologies of both sets of unaffected littermates show overlap along pc <dig> and pc <dig> 

to consider the relative amount of variation attributable to shape alone  among the e <dig>  animals, the pca was repeated using the linear distances of each observation scaled by the observation’s geometric mean  <cit>  . the pca of the scale-free shape data maintained the separation between mutant and unaffected mice, but only slightly reduced the amount of within-group variation, suggesting that at e <dig> , differences in scale do not greatly contribute to form differences between fgfr <dig> mutant and unaffected littermates or to the differences between fgfr2

and fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice.

the 3d patterns of shape difference between the fgfr2

 apert syndrome mouse models and their unaffected littermates at e <dig>  were evaluated using euclidean distance matrix analysis   <cit>  . the null hypothesis test of similarity in shape between fgfr <dig> mutant mice and unaffected littermates provide an initial evaluation of form differences between mutant mice and unaffected littermates. an additional table file provides the results of these hypothesis tests . estimates of localized differences and evaluation of the statistical uncertainty of these estimates are contained within bootstrapped confidence intervals discussed below.

confidence intervals for local effects of the two fgfr <dig> apert syndrome mutations at e <dig>  reveal differential characteristics of mutation-driven shape change. most notable is the overall reduction in the more rostral elements of the skull in fgfr2
+/s252w
 mice relative to unaffected littermates , especially in the premaxillae, the posterior aspect of the palate, and dimensions that connect the premaxillae with the rostral cranial base. an additional movie file provides a 3d view of these differences . in contrast, fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice show localized increases in posterior facial dimensions relative to unaffected littermates . an additional movie file provides a 3d view of these differences . both models show a rostrocaudal reduction across the basioccipital synchondrosis, coupled with increasing distances between the rostral aspect of the basioccipital and the pterygoid processes. fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice show an increase in distances between the frontal process of the maxilla and the palate relative to unaffected littermates , which is unique to this mutation. a relative increase in width of the caudal cranial vault is seen in both models . fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice also show an increase in caudal cranial vault height .

p <dig>  at p <dig>  fgfr2
+/s252w
  and fgfr2
+/p253r
  mutant mice demonstrate statistically significant differences in global shape and in the shapes of all anatomical subsets relative to their respective littermates . a four to five-fold increase in the number of significant differences of local cranial measures are present at p <dig> relative to what is estimated for morphological differences at e <dig> . additional movie files provide a 3d view of these differences . details of the specific differences in the anatomical effects of the two apert syndrome mutations at p <dig> were previously described  <cit>  and differ from those described for e <dig> . at p <dig>  differences between mutant mice and their unaffected littermates occur across the entire skull but the facial skeleton is the most affected region, with fgfr2
+/s252w
 mutant mice displaying significantly more severe dysmorphology localized to the posterior palate  <cit> . coronal suture patency was not strongly correlated with skull dysmorphology at p <dig> in either fgfr <dig> mutant.

growth related shape variation
principal components analyses of ontogenetic variation in skull form  revealed that skull morphology of mice carrying the fgfr <dig> s252w and p253r mutations cluster near one another at both e <dig>  and p <dig>  clearly separated from their age-matched unaffected littermates . pc <dig>  primarily reveals the impact of developmental age, with the skulls of all e <dig>  mice gravitating towards the negative end of pc <dig>  and the older mice situated at the positive end . pc <dig>  separates groups according to whether or not group members carry one of the two fgfr <dig> mutations. although the morphological consequences of developmental age convey a strong signal during late embryogenesis , the impact of carrying one of the two fgfr <dig> mutations is also apparent at e <dig>  and at p <dig> .

an alternate way to consider the relative amount of variation in shape among the ontogenetic samples is to repeat the pca analysis using linear distances for each observation scaled by their respective geometric mean . separation of groups is maintained in the analysis of skull shape, though the distance among groups is decreased, emphasizing both the substantial contribution of size-related changes in shape to variation produced by growth and the distinct patterns of dysmorphogenesis associated with these fgfr <dig> mutations . distinction among groups defined on the basis of developmental age is delineated primarily along pc <dig> , but an equally clear separation among skull shapes defined by the presence/absence of an fgfr <dig> mutation is revealed along pc <dig> , indicating that a substantial proportion of variation in skull shape is a consequence of carrying one of the two fgfr <dig> mutations. approximately one-third of the overall variation is due to shape alone, as calculated by the ratio of the sum-of-variances for ln-transformed ratios of distances to their geometric mean  to the sum-of-variances for ln-transformed distances among all landmarks  - a remarkable amount given that data from two age groups comprise substantial differences in overall size  <cit> . regardless of whether cranial form  or cranial shape  is considered, distinction between the fgfr2
+/p253r
 and fgfr2
+/s252w
 apert syndrome mice cranial morphologies is not apparent at e <dig> , but the two mutation groups are fairly well-discriminated at p <dig> 

growth difference of apert syndrome fgfr2

 and fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice
we quantify growth as the process that changes the configuration  of a mouse skull at e <dig>  to its configuration at p <dig> and statistically evaluate differences in growth among groups using growth difference matrix analysis  . within each model for apert syndrome, mice carrying an fgfr <dig> mutation exhibited statistically significant differences in late prenatal skull growth relative to unaffected littermates for most of the craniofacial regions. an additional table provides the results of these hypothesis tests . confidence intervals testing reveal statistically significant differences in growth of the majority of linear distances measured among landmarks. relative to unaffected littermates, fgfr2
+/s252w
 and fgfr2
+/p253r
 apert syndrome mice both display decreased magnitudes of growth in most rostrocaudal dimensions crossing the premaxillae and the maxillary palatal shelves . additional movie files show these growth differences in 3d [see additional file  <dig> for 3d view of differences in growth between fgfr2
+/s252w
 mice and unaffected littermates and additional file  <dig> for 3d view of differences in growth between fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice and unaffected littermates]. growth is also diminished along distances between the most dorsal extension of the frontal process of the maxillae and points on the rostral cranial base and palate in both models contributing to a facial skeleton in mutant mice that is generally narrowed, flattened and reduced in height. relative to unaffected littermates, growth is increased in distances between the ethmoid and the premaxillary-maxillary suture . the relative increase in mediolateral growth of the cranial base and neurocranium seen in fgfr2
+/s252w
 mice  does not occur in fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice . relative to unaffected littermates, both models experience increased growth of the caudal cranial base along a rostrocaudal axis.

the most caudal aspect of the palate has been previously identified as a site of localized dysmorphology in fgfr2
+/s252w
 and fgfr2
+/p253r
 apert syndrome mice, as well as a region where the morphological effects and localized cellular processes of the two fgfr <dig> mutations can be differentiated  <cit> . hypothesis tests of similarity in growth show that palatal growth patterns are different from unaffected mice in both apert syndrome models. direct comparison of palatal growth between fgfr2
+/s252w
 and fgfr2
+/p253r
 apert syndrome mice revealed high variability in palatal growth for each model. as a result, even though the magnitude of growth of some palatal dimensions were dissimilar between the two models, the differences were not significant . compared to unaffected littermates, differences in growth are strongest at the caudal aspect of the pterygoid plates in both models.

relative to unaffected littermates, magnitudes of late prenatal growth of the cranial base in fgfr2

 apert syndrome mutant mice are significantly increased along mediolateral dimensions. only the increased mediolateral growth of the basi-sphenoid synchondrosis is shared with fgfr2
+/p253r
 apert syndrome mice; the other local changes in cranial base growth are specific to the fgfr <dig> s252w mutation . differences in growth of the cranial vault are minimal between fgfr2
+/s252w
and fgfr2
+/p253r
 apert syndrome mice and their unaffected littermates .

estimation and evaluation of hypothetical forms
differences in cranial morphology among our samples at p <dig> are due to the combination of altered morphology at e <dig>  and distinct growth patterns for each genotype group. the production of hypothetical forms and their evaluation with respect to samples of known morphologies  <cit>  provide an alternate approach to the evaluation of the contribution of growth pattern to craniofacial phenotypes. the hypothetical forms in this case embody the 3d morphology of an unaffected mouse cranium at e <dig>  and the growth pattern estimated for mice carrying one of the two fgfr <dig> mutations. the 3d coordinates of the two hypothetical crania  were added to our samples and analyzed using pca. because the simulated morphologies  and the unaffected mice share the same initial morphologies at e <dig> , any differences observed between the hypothetical forms and unaffected p <dig> mice can be attributed exclusively to differences in growth caused by the presence of an fgfr <dig> mutation.

pca is used to visualize differences in growth trajectories  previously shown by gdma to be statistically different between mutant and unaffected groups. neither hypothetical form falls within the concentration of unaffected p <dig> cranial morphologies, revealing the contribution of abnormal prenatal growth pattern to the morphological differences between genotypes at birth. the position of the two hypothetical forms suggests that the fgfr2
+/s252w
 mutation provides a relatively stronger contribution to dysmorphogenesis.

patterns of suture patency
current theories state that when premature fusion of cranial vault sutures occur, secondary distortion of skull shape results in part from the lack of growth perpendicular to the fused suture and compensatory overgrowth at the non-fused sutures  <cit> . to test whether these same principles apply to sutures of the facial skeleton we scored patterns of suture patency as visualized on hrμct images of each mouse assigning qualitative scores of open, partially open, or fused to the entire length of the sutures . these observations were used to build a comparative timeline of suture closure in all groups of mice .

we previously demonstrated a higher percentage of fgfr2
+/s252w
 mice with complete  bicoronal synostosis at p <dig> compared to fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice  <cit> . at e <dig> , variable levels of coronal suture fusion are seen in both apert syndrome models  although neither displays completely fused coronal sutures, indicating that premature fusion of coronal sutures is well underway at e <dig>  and are nearing complete fusion by p <dig>  <cit> . the zygomatic-maxillary and premaxilla-maxillary sutures are invariably fused in fgfr2
+/s252w
and fgfr2
+/p253r
 mutant mice at p <dig>  while these sutures are consistently patent  in unaffected p <dig> littermates . no fusion of the zygomatic-maxillary sutures is seen in fgfr2
+/s252w
 mutant mice at e <dig> , but unilateral and bilateral partial fusion is seen in small numbers of fgfr2
+/p253r
 mutant mice at e <dig>  . a majority  of fgfr2
+/p253r
 and fgfr2
+/s252w
 mutant mice show bilateral partial fusion of the premaxilla-maxillary suture at e <dig>  while these sutures are fully patent in unaffected littermates . the maxillary-palatine sutures are patent in all animals at e <dig>  but show variable patterns of fusion at p <dig> . the fronto-maxillary sutures show a consistent tendency towards fusion in fgfr2
+/s252w
and fgfr2
+/p253r
 mice at p <dig> , but remain completely patent in unaffected littermates. most midline palatal sutures  are patent in all mice at e <dig> , but the interpremaxillary suture reveals a tendency towards fusion in unaffected mice beginning at e <dig>  and continuing to p <dig> .

to explore the possibility that compensatory growth driven by the premature closure of facial sutures drives craniofacial dysmorphology, we examined the relationship between facial suture closure patterns and growth related cranial shape variation. states of facial suture patency  coded for individual mice were plotted on the basis of differences in skull shape as quantified by pca . the average condition of all facial sutures estimated for each mouse reveals a strong relationship between facial suture patency and intensity of craniofacial dysmorphology  while the relationship between patency of individual facial sutures and cranial shape variation  reveals local patterns. closing or closed bilateral facial sutures are always associated with increased facial dysmorphology as defined by pc <dig> , while the relationship between midline sutures  and facial dysmorphology is less clear. the abnormally patent interpremaxillary suture in mutant mice  enables compensatory mediolateral facial growth not possible in unaffected mice.

discussion
although the specific changes in craniofacial shape and the magnitude and direction of 3d cranial growth patterns in mice do not coincide exactly with those of human beings, our results agree with observations of infant apert syndrome phenotypes. in humans, apert syndrome cases carrying the fgfr <dig> s252w mutation have a more severe facial phenotype relative to those who carry the fgfr <dig> p253r mutation, while the fgfr <dig> p253r group has more severe limb anomalies  <cit> . these craniofacial findings have recently been confirmed quantitatively in a study of craniofacial phenotypes in fgfr-related craniosynostosis syndromes  <cit> . our analysis concurs with these observations of the differential effects of the two apert syndrome mutations revealing that mice carrying the fgfr2s252w mutation typically have a more severe facial phenotype and a growth pattern that contributes to the increased intensity of facial dysmorphology relative to mice carrying the fgfr2p253r mutation.

mutation-driven differences in growth patterns concur with the observations that growth modification in apert syndrome has its onset prenatally  <cit> , and that dysmorphology increases in severity with age, producing additional complications  <cit> . because of the continual contribution of fgf/fgfr signaling to cell processes that direct the assembly and growth of diverse cranial tissues, fgfr mutations affect growth patterns in unpredictable ways. individuals born with apert syndrome invariably face multiple complex surgeries that begin in infancy and continue through adulthood. the functional and cosmetic outcomes of these procedures cannot be anticipated in detail and the strategy and number of these surgeries are typically tailored to the individual. we have provided evidence that variation in the causative mutation, the severity of disease phenotypes, and the changes that occur with growth of the craniofacial complex might be significant contributing factors to the uncertainty of long-term surgical outcome. individual phenotypes result from change in specific  signalling and regulatory cascades, and these changes have consequences for development of various tissues and, ultimately craniofacial variation. quantitative definition of growth patterns, the ability to anticipate these trajectories, and the use of evidence-based growth simulation in patient care could contribute to improved patient-centered outcomes either through changes in surgical approach, or through more realistic modeling and expectation of surgical outcome. our results indicate that growth pattern is an additional source for observed phenotypic differences among patients carrying these differing apert syndrome mutations and suggest that developed therapies need to specifically target the mutation rather than being generally adapted to the disease.

previous work with mouse models has revealed that tissues other than bone are affected by fgfr <dig> mutations  <cit>  and that early postnatal growth patterns of the brain and skull in fgfr2
+/p253r
 apert syndrome mice differ from their unaffected littermates  <cit> . the impact of growth pattern on emergent prenatal morphology quantified here is suggestive of the combination of two origins of growth insult: 1) mutation-driven disruption of early cellular processes  resulting in the initial construction of abnormal phenotypes; coupled with 2) the impact of the mutation on additional cellular processes and tissue-tissue interactions resulting in changes in functional pressures and exchanges among growing tissues, changes often considered secondary to the direct mutational effects. early closure of facial sutures, a direct result of disrupted cellular processes, constitutes yet another influence on growth but due to the comparative abundance of sutures within the facial skeleton, the ‘compensatory growth’ model described in the case of prematurely closed vault sutures  <cit>  is not easily translated to facial growth patterns in craniosynostosis syndromes.

suture formation, patency and eventual closure occurs through coordinated integration of signaling pathways  via processes that are not currently understood. our inability to identify the physiological trigger that elicits premature suture closure indicates that the molecular instructions for this event and for suture closure in typical cases occur well within hierarchies of interactions that involve genes carrying identified mutations. premature closure of sutures is an example of “tinkering”  <cit>  of the evolutionarily stable, generic suture fusion event, though patency/closure of each suture may be supervised by subtly different change in specific regulatory cascades. vault and facial suture patency may be sensitive to similar or different signaling families, to variation in the strength or timing of signals, or to shifts in patterning boundaries. changes in patency patterns can have multiple consequences for phenotypic variation.

evolutionarily, sutures are recognized as much for their role in mediating cranial mechanics as for their contribution to bone growth  <cit> . vertebrate evolution reveals a general trend of reduced cranial kinesis through the loss or restriction of some intracranial joints  and reduction in the number of jaw and skull bones   <cit> , which is strongly associated with changes in cranial morphology. though it is not possible to record changes in rates of suture closure across evolutionary time scales, our systematic record of differences in relative rates of suture closure in mutant and typically developing mice strongly suggests a role for variation in the relative rates of suture closure  in generating phenotypic variability in craniofacial shape over evolutionary time.

evidence presented here of the local and global aspects of 3d growth patterns that contribute to craniofacial morphogenesis provides a layer of information rarely quantified in the dissection of mutational effects on phenotypes. current research paradigms focused on the mechanistic basis of premature suture closure reveal highly localized effects of activating mutations , but these effects vary by suture  and time of development. in the case of fgfr-related craniosynostosis syndromes, fgfr mutations affect many tissues throughout development  <cit> . local patterns of signaling are dynamic, continually changing in intensity and temporo-spatial distribution such that current methods of histological and immunohistochemical observation can provide only a limited sampling of data required to predict morphology. because of the continual contribution of fgf/fgfr signaling to cell processes that direct the assembly and growth of diverse cranial tissues, fgfr mutations affect growth patterns in ways that are currently unpredictable. groups of cells, tissues and organs respond to the mutant signal by changing their behavior according to the aberrant instruction, but must simultaneously adjust behaviors in response to the signals emanating from functional pressures of surrounding cells and tissues, including the shifting constraints caused by prematurely closing sutures. complex combinations of molecular, cellular and biomechanical information underlying patterns of accommodation of developing structures constitute the growth pattern. combining precise knowledge of mutation-induced changes in growth pattern with geometric information of local patterns of changes in signaling and cell function using a multiscale computational network approach can contribute to models of developmental tissue mechanics bringing us closer to modeling testable hypotheses of the morphogenetic unfolding of genetic programs during ontogeny.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the differential effects of the fgfr <dig> s252w and p253r mutations result in mutation-specific prenatal cranial growth patterns that are responsible, at least in part, for differences in postnatal cranial phenotypes of the two mutation groups. we have demonstrated that the two gain-of-function mutations in fgfr <dig> uniquely perturb prenatal cranial growth patterns and cause differences in suture patency and craniofacial dysmorphology that can be quantitatively distinguished as early as e <dig> . within each mutation group, the cranial features that are divergent between mutant and unaffected littermates at e <dig>  are not the same features that are divergent at p <dig>  further, the patterns of growth suggest that dysmorphologies become increasingly different with age. finally, regardless of initial morphology, we demonstrate how precise 3d estimates of changes in the growth pattern caused by the presence of either of these two fgfr <dig> mutations contribute to the production of craniofacial dysmorphology.

our findings suggest that direct and indirect effects of a mutation need to be considered when determining the production of craniofacial morphology. individual variation in fgfr signal strength and response-to-signal contribute to osteoprogenitor cell differentiation, bone deposition, and the premature fusion of sutures, but physical accommodations of changing structures over time also participate and contribute to signaling cascades that are part of cranial morphogenesis. any proposed therapeutic strategy that targets cellular processes local to a site of altered development  should be evaluated in terms of the effects of that localized rescue on surrounding tissues, and the impact of local changes in cell dynamics on growth of the overall cranial assembly. although our results specifically address disease-causing fgfr <dig> mutations demonstrating the relevance of altered growth pattern to the production of fgfr-associated dysmorphogenesis, this approach can be applied to other murine disease models and to human data when available.
