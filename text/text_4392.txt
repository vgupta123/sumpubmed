BACKGROUND
in drosophila, some external sensory organs found in the anterior region of larvae are composed of many neurons and support cells that seem to represent an aggregation of several sensory units. this is the case for the antenno-maxillary complex  that forms the chemosensory system of the drosophila larva. the chemosensory apparatus of the larval head is formed during embryogenesis  <cit>  and consists essentially of three major sensilla complexes on the cephalic lobe, the dorsal , terminal  and ventral organs , and a series of pharyngeal sensilla  <cit> . while the do appears to be a mixed smell and taste organ, the to, vo and pharyngeal sensilla may be exclusively gustatory  <cit> .

in previous studies, we described a mutant allele of the transcription factor prospero  that is associated with several alterations in both amc and the cns  <cit> . v <dig> homozygotes die before forming pupae. surviving larvae remain much smaller than wild-type individuals and are impaired for their response to salt and sucrose  <cit> . using a set of previously characterised voila alleles  that express different levels of prospero  protein, we found that the level of pros expression detected in the embryonic precursor region of the amc, was related to the degree of alteration of larval taste  <cit> . in embryonic and larval amc, pros is expressed in the same cell cluster , including neuronal cells  and many accessory cells but no glial cells  <cit> .

the pros gene encodes a transcription factor protein that contains a highly divergent putative homeodomain and a conserved prospero domain that are both necessary for sequence-specific dna binding and prospero nuclear localisation  <cit> . pros is known to be expressed in neuronal precursor cells  <cit>  and participates in cell fate decision in both neuroblasts and sensory organ lineages  <cit> . pros has been shown to control axonal and dendritic outgrowth  <cit> , glial development  <cit>  and to be a key regulator of mitotic activity in embryos  <cit> . pros affects several cell cycle genes and can either promote or inhibit them depending on the cellular or the developmental context  <cit> . more recently choksi et al.  <cit>  showed that in the embryonic nerve cord pros repressed target genes such as cell cycle genes required for self-renewal, and was also required to activate genes involved in terminal differentiation.

in a previous study on the larval antenno-maxillary complex, we showed that loss of pros function did not alter the mitotic activity or the final number of neurons. by contrast, many neural tracts connecting the amc to the cns are affected  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that one key role of pros in the larval amc is to control the expression of genes involved in neuron-specific development such as axon routing and/or neurite outgrowth. however, as pros is expressed in non-neuronal cells in the amc , it is likely that, it regulates genes that are also involved in other functions.

in order to identify the pros target genes associated with this organ, we performed microarray analysis on larval amc tissue isolated from the wild type, the v <dig> mutant and two previously characterised prospero alleles  <cit> , v <dig>  and v <dig> . to establish the amc specificity of these genes, we included analysis of samples from isolated larval cns for these four alleles.

.

in the prosv <dig>  allele, the full length pgal <dig> transposon is inserted upstream of the pros coding region . prosv <dig>  results from the correct and total remobilization of the transposon, in this strain the wild type phenotype is restored. in prosv <dig>  and prosv <dig> , the pgal <dig> element has been partially removed, respectively  <dig> and  <dig> bp remain inserted  <dig> bp upstream the pros start site. the peak of developmental lethality, the taste response of late homozygous 2nd instar larva, pros expression level in larvae and axonal misrouting are indicated for each prosv allele.

the larval taste response was measured towards  <dig>  m sucrose and  <dig>  m nacl concentration that are known to respectively attract or repulse wild type drosophila. v <dig> mutants were indifferent to both substances , v <dig> showed an intermediate response: they were repulsed by nacl but remained indifferent to sucrose and v <dig> and v <dig> present a normal taste response to both substances. the pros expression pattern is indicated by comparison to the v <dig> wild type: in the amc, v <dig> showed no pros expression but for the other alleles, pros expression pattern was similar to v <dig>  in the cns, all mutant alleles showed a distinct altered expression pattern as compared to the wild type .

our findings indicate that, in this sensory organ, pros is mainly associated with the regulation of genes that are essential for correct routing of neural processes and synaptic transmission. many of these genes are involved in the development and remodelling of the nervous system during metamorphosis. interestingly, we also found that loss of pros function induced the misregulation of a subset of genes important for growth, and autophagy. finally, the possible role of egfr  and the n  pathway in regulating all of these functions is discussed.

RESULTS
the developing amc and pros expression
we have previously shown  <cit>  that in the developing amc, pros is always expressed in the same cluster of cells. in addition, neither mitotic activity nor apoptosis was observed during the third instar larval stage or at late embryonic stages suggesting that the final number of pros expressing cells is fixed before the end of embryogenesis  <cit> . this hypothesis was further confirmed by analysing mitotic activity in the developing wild type amc  using an h3p marker. our results showed that the h3p labelling disappeared completely after the embryonic stages 12- <dig>  indicating that additional cells are not provided until the last larval stage. however, some pros expressing cells grew in size at the liii stage. scoring the different pros+ cell type morphology , we found that the wild type larval amc  was composed of  <dig>  large pros+ cells  and  <dig>  small pros+ cells. among the latter,  <dig>   were neuronal cells  <cit> . pros is never expressed in glial cells. interestingly, pros loss of function affected the axonal pathway in the embryonic amc, but produced the correct number of neuronal cells  <cit>  and curiously induced an excess of glial cells, which, we suspect, originated from incorrect peripheral glial cells migration. therefore, if pros was expressed in the same number of cells in the embryo and larvae and since no additional cell division was seen after stage  <dig>  it is likely that pros is not involved in cell fate choice in the larval amc.

we have quantified the number of pros expressing cells  and neuronal cells  in the third instar larval amc of wild type  and v <dig> mutants. we distinguish two types of pros+ cells on the basis of their size: large and small cells. some small pros+ cells express elav markers and are probably differentiated neurons. in v <dig> mutants, no more pros protein is detected in the larval amc, but the number of neurons remains unchanged.

to better clarify the role of pros in the amc, we carried out microarray analysis on wild type  and three prospero mutants , which present different expression levels of pros  <cit> . v <dig> is considered as a null pros allele for the larval amc as no pros protein is detected in this organ. it presents an abnormal taste response to sucrose and nacl , and shows an alteration of the neural connections between the amc and cns as well as arborisation defects in larval neuromuscular junction  <cit> . in the v <dig> larval cns, pros is still expressed but at a lower level than in the wild type v <dig>  v <dig> larval cns also shows several defects, which include early initiation of cell death and abnormal sub-cellular localization of the pros protein .

v <dig> and v <dig> are both derived from the v <dig> allele and result from incomplete excision of the pgal <dig> transposon, respectively  <dig> and  <dig> bp remain inserted upstream of the pros start site . a previous study showed that v <dig>  <cit>  and v <dig>  present a correct structure of the larval amc and a normal expression level of pros mrna. no variation was observed in the number of glia or neuron cells and the pattern of pros expression was similar to that of the wild type v <dig>  since, v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> present the same expression pattern in the amc and have the same genetic background, individual variations , can be more easily eliminated by the use of several but similar fly lines.

in the cns both alleles overexpress  the pros mrna but present a distinct pattern as regards to the mitotic activity or to the pros and elav  labelling . in the ventral nerve cord v <dig> showed a clear hyperplasia due to an excess of neurons . finally, mitotic activity, revealed by anti-phistone-h <dig> antibody   was strongly increased, especially in the optic lobes of v <dig>  in conclusion, each of v <dig> and v <dig> allele presented a distinct abnormal pattern as compared to the wild type v <dig>  therefore, we used in the cns v <dig> allele only as its pros expression pattern was previously published.

all these alleles were used to for the transcriptome analysis since they have the same genetic background.

most specifically, to identify the genes that are misregulated in the amc, the comparison was made between the null amc v <dig> mutant and the other alleles v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> as all three present the same wild type expression pattern in this structure.

it should be mentioned that the role of pros in the larvae cns was not investigated in this study. the cns was used to be compared with amc  and to determine whether the putative candidate genes identified in the amc could be found in the cns. for this latest purpose, we decided to limit the microarray analysis in the cns to the comparison between v <dig> and v <dig>  since the v <dig> allele presents an intermediate pros expression pattern in the cns. this avoids misinterpretation of the cns data.

transcription profile of prosv <dig> larvae
expression data of a total of  <dig> samples were analysed, including both cns and amc samples for the four prosv alleles and  <dig> to  <dig> independent rna extractions for each allele. we searched for sets of genes participating in the same biological function  and differentially expressed between prosv mutants. we used the discriminating score  as the detection method for differential expression, smoothed on the hierarchical clustering tree to detect peaks of correlated genes. this method had the advantage of detecting peaks of optimal size. this size could not be known a priori. a ds score can be assigned to each node in the dendrogram. the node corresponding to the maximum ds score was chosen as the node best fitting the peak.

the results were displayed using treeview  <cit> . as it can be seen in the figure 2a, a cluster of genes differentially expressed in amc and cns tissues and in a pros independent manner was observed. the genes of this cluster  were clearly overexpressed in the amc while the same genes were underexpressed for all alleles in the cns .

the  <dig> genes found highly correlated in the peak  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are grouped according to their respective go annotation class. the most significant classes of genes enriched in our list are "cell fate commitment", "proteasome complex" and "signal transduction". the p value indicates the probability for a given ontology to be associated at random to this cluster. the first  <dig> genes indicated in bold and by an asterisk share a common dna motif  in their promoter and were also found to be differentially expressed between v <dig> and v <dig> cns.

the last column on the right specifies the known biological function  of these genes in the drosophila larvae . this manual annotation allowed the attribution of biological function to  <dig> genes. some genes have either never been studied in larvae or their respective functions are currently unknown. by contrast to the go annotation , the use of manual annotation indicates that the dysfunction of pros leads in larvae to the misregulation of genes that mostly deal with neurite outgrowth, growth and autophagy and sensory organ formation . all genes were found to be overexpressed in the mutant v <dig> amc except for the  <dig> genes associated with the proteasome complex go annotation.

in the next step, we determined those genes affected by loss of pros function for each organ with the ds. for the amc, as v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> have a normal pros expression pattern in this structure, the ds was calculated for each gene between v <dig> and all other alleles. for the cns, since v <dig> exhibited a distinct pattern , the ds for each gene was calculated between v <dig> and the v <dig> alleles only.

to visualize groups of correlated genes that were differentially expressed between v <dig> and other alleles, the ds score obtained for the amc or cns was plotted alongside the hierarchical clustering and smoothed in a sliding windows of  <dig> genes. as shown in figure 2b, different peaks can be detected. each peak represents co-expressed genes sensitive to pros expression. to avoid the analysis of non-significant variations, we decided to assess the biological functions of these groups of genes. we therefore searched for significant enrichments of gene ontology terms  in each cluster using gominer  <cit> . in the amc, only  <dig> peaks  could be associated with significant go functions . complete gene lists for peaks 1- <dig> are presented in .

in peak  <dig>  the  <dig> genes overexpressed in v <dig> amc were significantly associated with the over-represented go term « signal transducer activity » . significant enrichments of the go term "proteasome complex"  were found for  <dig> genes in peak  <dig>  all of these genes were underexpressed in v <dig> amc. peak  <dig>  with the highest ds, was common to amc and cns and associated with the over-represented go term "cell fate commitment" . inside this peak, a cluster of  <dig> genes overexpressed in v <dig> amc and highly correlated  was isolated and we found a cluster of  <dig> genes overexpressed in v <dig> cns and correlated  in the same peak. interestingly, among the  <dig> cns genes,  <dig>  also belonged to the amc gene list .

finally, to assess our microarray analysis, we quantified the expression of seven selected genes by q-pcr. as shown in table  <dig>  our results were consistent with the microarray data except for the hb  gene found to be overexpressed in the cns but not in the amc. because the two methods have different sensitivities, the magnitude of the change determined by microarray and real time pcr is not the same. the orientation of changes, however, is identical.

the relative expression level  of selected genes was measured using the q- pcr or microarray analysis data; our results were consistent with the microarray data except for the hb  gene found to be overexpressed in the cns but not in the amc. the values in gray correspond to the genes found differentially expressed between v <dig> and v <dig> in the cns but not in the amc using microarray analysis. accordingly, no significant variation was found for these genes in the amc, using q-pcr.

an interesting observation was that we found highly correlated genes responding to pros variation in both cns and amc. this tight correlation in two different tissues could suggest that these genes may be controlled by common transcription factors including pros. we searched for transcription factor binding sites that were common to these  <dig> genes. we used a gibbs sampling method  <cit>  on the - <dig> to + <dig> bp promoter region of these genes. this method allowed the determination of degenerated motifs, described by a position weight matrix , in a set of sequences by iterative sampling.

we found a motif shown as a logo  <cit>  in figure 2e. it notably included a cagctg core. this motif shows weak and probably not significant similarities with other pros motifs previously proposed for drosophila: taagnct  <cit> , cacnnct  <cit> , taagacg  <cit> . therefore, additional experiments are now necessary to see whether the motif identified in this study could really bind the prospero transcription factor in vivo.

additional manual annotation to specify the role of pros putative target genes in drosophila larvae
our microarray analyses showed that peak  <dig> contained  <dig> overexpressed genes associated with the go annotation, "cell fate commitment" . these data are not consistent with our previous studies showing that pros is not involved in cell fate determination in the larval amc  <cit> . we were intrigued by this discrepancy and therefore we looked more deeply for the function of these genes in the larvae. interestingly, though most of the genes present in this peak were associated with cell fate determination in embryos, such evidence was mostly missing for the larvae peripheral nervous system . thus, it is likely that the go annotation was mostly deduced from the reported function of these genes in drosophila embryos. therefore, to more specifically identify the role of these genes in the drosophila larva pns, we used additional manual annotation.

the first step consisted in compiling all of the information available on the role attributed to each of the  <dig> genes identified from peaks 1- <dig>  but most specifically in drosophila larvae. the information was collected using flybase, mutant analysis, associated phenotypes, research articles and microarray data. as much as possible, we selected only data that reported the function of these genes in the larval nervous system and more specifically the sensory system. out of the  <dig> genes, we found that  <dig> had unknown biological functions or had not been documented in larvae . since the genes encoding the subunit of the proteasome complex are under-expressed and the remaining genes are overexpressed in the v <dig> amc, a description of the phenotype generated by the upregulation and downregulation of the corresponding genes in larvae was given . though many phenotypes were available for a gene, we selected only those reported for the nervous system and preferentially for the pns.

analysis of the resulting compiled data on larva  revealed that the  <dig> genes fell into at least one of the following functional categories:  neurite outgrowth and/or synaptic transmission;  growth, autophagy;  sensory organ  development. a list of these genes and their associated annotation terms is summarized in table  <dig>  and a schematic representation is given in figure  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  some genes can be associated with two functional classes, and four genes  are associated with the three functional categories: neurite outgrowth, autophagy, and olfactory system development.

genes involved in neural processes and synaptic transmission are misregulated in the v <dig> amc mutant
one of the functional categories deduced from manual annotation associates some putative pros target genes with neurite outgrowth and/or synaptic transmission . although synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth belong to different functional categories, we decided to keep these genes in the same class since many of them are involved in both synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth.

mostly, the genes are overexpressed in the larval v <dig> amc, . it has been reported that the upregulation of most of these candidates inhibits neurite outgrowth in larval neurons . this is clearly the case for egfr , n , bnl  and rac <dig>  <cit>  whose overexpression was previously shown to inhibit axon extension in larval neurons. this is also the case for gwl , limk <dig> , nej  or cg <dig>  pvr, whose upregulation induces axon pathfinding defects or impaired neurotransmitter release in the larval neuromuscular junction   <cit> . interestingly, similar axon pathfinding and nmj defects were observed in the v <dig> mutant  <cit> .

we have noticed that most of the genes included in this functional class can also drive neural connectivity remodelling in larvae, a process particularly important during metamorphosis. egfr, notch, bnl, rac <dig>  <cit> , and the genes associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system were all reported to be involved in axon extension/retraction, pruning and morphogenesis of larval peripheral sensory neurons . indeed, though most larval sensory neurons will degenerate during metamorphosis, some persist as neurons and undergo stereotyped pruning of their dendrites and axon terminal branches during early metamorphosis  <cit> .

we were not surprised to find that the genes encoding the different proteasome subunits  are downregulated in v <dig> amc . indeed, the acute regulation of their protein level is a primary determinant of protein turnover and neurotransmission strength  <cit> .

recently, an elegant study of choksi et al.  <cit>  showed that pros is required for activation of neuronal differentiation genes in embryos and identified n, bnl, limki, egfr and pvr, prosα <dig> as putative pros targets in embryos. this reinforces our finding suggesting that in the larval amc, pros plays a crucial role in the modulation of neuronal activity through the control of genes involved in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.

loss of pros function alters the expression of genes involved in autophagy and growth
the second functional group that emerges from our analysis includes candidates that play a critical role in the control of autophagy, a process used to provide energy and nutrients during metamorphosis and early adulthood.

the association between pros and the regulation of autophagy is mainly attested by the upregulation of genes such as cg <dig>  egfr, keren , ftz-f <dig> , fk506-bp <dig> , iap <dig> , nej, notch and genes associated with proteasome complex .

some of the genes cited above were also found to mediate cell growth . however, it is not yet clear if the overexpression of these genes systematically inhibits cell growth. for example, the upregulation of lk <dig>  or fk506-bp <dig> leads to either the activation or inhibition of cell growth in a context-dependent way  <cit> .

we have already mentioned that notch and egfr pathways were involved in neurite outgrowth , interestingly, we found that these two pathways were also associated with both the regulation of autophagy and cell growth control  <cit>  , suggesting that pros could mediate all of these functions through the modulation of these two pathways.

our finding that pros is associated with the expression of genes involved in growth and or autophagy is consistent with the phenotypic defects observed in v <dig> homozygote mutants: i) individuals died before reaching puparium formation; ii) surviving larvae and pupae remained much smaller than wild-type individuals; iii) numerous labelled cells were observed in the fat body using pgal <dig> enhancer trap line v <dig>  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that many of the genes found in this functional group are directly or indirectly associated with insulin-signalling pathways and more specifically the insulin/tor  pathway, an important mediator of growth, autophagy and nutrient sensing .

pros and the olfactory system
pros was detected both in the terminal  and in the dorsal  organs of the larval amc  <cit> . accordingly, we found that pros loss of function in the amc induced the upregulation of all candidate genes  that were known to be involved in the development of sensory organs . most of our knowledge on the function of these genes came from studies done on adult drosophila sensory organs . for example, it has been reported that mutations in the genes ash <dig> or ckii alpha  can elicit supernumerary or ectopic adult sensory organs  <cit> . similarly, overexpression of iap <dig> or limk <dig> induces respectively additional macrochaetes  <cit>  or ectopic glomeruli in adult antennae lobes  <cit> . the transmembrane receptor notch and the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr also seem to play an important role in the organisation, remodelling and function of the olfactory system . this confirms previous observations which showed that they were respectively required for selecting the sensory organ precursor lineages  <cit>  and for the development of some of the neurons and cuticular structures of the antenno-maxillary sensory complex  <cit> .

discussion
pros may regulate genes essential for neurite outgrowth and remodelling
in the amc, the transcription factor prospero is expressed in a cluster of cells  that emerge during embryonic life and are maintained till the end of the larval stages. in embryos, pros was reported to be involved in cell fate decision and in cell-cycle control. by contrast, our earlier data from the larval amc rather suggested that pros could assume more restricted functions, such as the control of neuron-specific functions  <cit> . the present study confirms this hypothesis and shows that in the chemosensory organs dedicated to larval olfactory and gustatory sensing, prospero could regulate genes involved in neurite outgrowth and synaptic transmission.

since pros was clearly shown to control axonal and dendritic outgrowth  <cit> , we cannot exclude the possibility that the connection of pros with several genes that drive synaptic activity could be the indirect consequence of its involvement in neurite outgrowth control. in this respect, it is interesting to mention that a recent study  <cit>  showed that axon targeting of the r <dig> drosophila photoreceptor cells to their synaptic partner requires r7-specific transcription factor prospero. these authors proposed that pros could promote cell-type-specific expression of sensory receptors and cell-surface proteins regulating synaptic target specificity.

as previously mentioned, some of the genes identified in this functional class are also involved in neural connectivity remodelling. how can this be achieved if the amc is completely histolysed? in fact, in drosophila, not all sensory neurons degenerate; some larval neurons persist and remodel to take on a new role in the adult system  <cit> . during the metamorphosis larval arbors of these neurons are pruned back and new adult-specific arbors are generated through a subsequent period of outgrowth. it seems that the neurites of these persistent larval neurons are used to partly guide axons of adult sensory neurons towards and within the cns  <cit> . therefore, histolysis and remodelling are two processes that are achieved during metamorphosis and could concern distinct neurons.

does pros play any role in amc neuronal remodelling? we cannot actually answer the question. however, it has been previously reported that the insulin and epidermal growth factor signalling pathways, as well as ubiquitin-specific proteases are all required for the regulation of drosophila neuronal remodelling  <cit> . interestingly, all of these components emerge clearly from our analysis.

actually, no work was done on the drosophila larvae anterior sense organ in order to check whether some of the sensory neurons  persist and remodel to take place in the adult olfactory or gustatory system. therefore, the question is left open. at least the answers will provide important insights into the mechanisms that govern developmental plasticity in insect nervous systems.

in summary, our data collected from larval amc and the previous genome wide expression profiling done on embryos  <cit>  confirms that pros is associated with the regulation of neuronal specific genes. in this respect, it is essential to note that except for a few genes , most of the pros target genes identified  in choksi et al.  <cit>  were not represented on our microarrays. for this reason, and because our experiments were performed on isolated individual larval tissues, it is not possible to determine whether the genes identified by these authors are specifically expressed in embryos and/or in tissues other than amc.

prospero and the insulin pathway
in drosophila, the insulin/tor signalling pathway  <cit>  is divided into two branches. the insulin and its downstream effectors p <dig> and foxo  represent one branch  <cit>  of this pathway, while the other branch acts through the tor family of serine-threonin kinases  <cit> . it has been shown that the insulin/tor signalling pathway inhibits autophagy  and controls growth by regulating ribosome biogenesis and protein biosynthetic capacity  <cit> . columbani et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the tor pathway is a nutritional checkpoint that participates in the systemic control of larval growth emanating from the fat body.

our microarray analysis has revealed a group of highly correlated pros candidate genes  that are either controlled by the insulin/tor signalling pathway or are directly involved in the signalling cascade. this is the case for ash <dig>  <cit>  which was found to be regulated by tor signalling. similarly, fk506-bp <dig> affects autophagy through the modulation of foxo  <cit>  and lk <dig> was reported to be a direct foxo target  <cit> . therefore it seems that in the larval amc, pros could be associated with growth, autophagy and nutrient sensing through the regulation of genes that are directly or indirectly linked to the insulin/tor pathway. interestingly, tor was found to be differentially expressed in the v <dig> pros mutant in the cns .

CONCLUSIONS
as previously described, loss of pros function in the amc induced several alterations including axon pathfinding defects and abnormal growth and taste responses. this is consistent with our microarray results showing that in the larval amc, pros expression is associated with the regulation of genes involved in the control of neurite outgrowth, mediation of growth and autophagy and in the organisation and function of the olfactory system. the mechanism by which all of these functions are achieved by pros in the amc is presently not known but egfr and/or notch pathways could play a central role. several lines of evidence are in favour of this hypothesis.

1- four ligands are known to bind egfr receptor: keren, gurken, spitz, and vein  <cit> . two of these were identified as potential targets of prospero: keren in both larval amc and cns and gurken  in the larval cns only . moreover, notch and egfr were identified as putative pros target genes in both embryos  <cit>  and larval amc, indicating that they could play a central role.

2- it has been reported that egfr signalling is required for the development of some of the neurons and cuticular structures present in the amc  <cit> . in this respect, it is interesting to point out that egfr involvement has been reported during the development of mouse gustatory epithelia in the palate and tongue  <cit> .

3- the expression of notch, egfr and pros have been shown to be tightly linked. it has been demonstrated that normal levels of pros expression in photoreceptor r <dig> cells in the drosophila eye require egfr signalling as well as notch activation  <cit> . in addition, a recent analysis has shown that in r <dig> cells, notch and egfr cooperate in a complex way to promote pros transcription  <cit> .

although these data suggest that notch and egfr could play a central role in the mechanism by which prospero carries out its function in the larval amc, this hypothesis has still to be validated. in the future, it will be of great interest to explore in detail the mechanism by which all of these functions are accomplished by the homeodomain transcription factor prospero.
