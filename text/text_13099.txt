BACKGROUND
human embryonic stem cells  possess the ability to self-renew in an undifferentiated state in culture while retaining the ability to differentiate into all of the cell types in the human body. these unique capabilities make hescs a renewable source of a wide range of cell types for potential use in research and cell-based drug screening and therapies for many diseases. these cells have been in high demand for use in basic and applied biomedical research. as of january  <dig>   <dig>  at least  <dig> human es cell lines have been derived worldwide  <cit> . large numbers of cell lines with genetic diversity are necessary to cover the vast spectrum of hla isotypes to avoid transplant rejection  <cit> . however, many of these cell lines are not fully characterized and differences among these cell lines are uncertain  <cit> , although recent studies have revealed similarities and differences among individually developed human embryonic stem cell lines  <cit> .

the comparison of the unique properties and behavior of each individually derived cell line is critical in identifying the safe and efficacious lines for research and therapeutic use  <cit> . it is also essential to understand how the inherited variation in the sex, stage, quality and genetic background of embryos, as well as environmental influences such as derivation methods and passage procedures can affect the ability of hes cell lines to self-renew and differentiate. directly comparing hes cell lines is challenging since all the genetic, environmental and methodological variables complicate the assessments. previous studies have attempted setting up a core set of standard assays to characterize the status of "stemness" and pluripotency  <cit>  and to define a reasonable set of markers that would serve as reliable indicators for self-renewal and differentiation of hescs  <cit> . in the present study, a side-by-side comparison of the ability to maintain an undifferentiated state and to self-renew under standard conditions, the ability to spontaneously differentiate into cell types of three germ layers in embryonic bodies, and directed differentiation under neural differentiation-promoting conditions was made between three nih registered hesc lines i <dig>  i <dig> and bg01v. i <dig>  and i <dig>  which were derived using rabbit anti-human whole antiserum with a normal xx and a normal xy karyotype respectively  <cit> ; bg01v contains known chromosomal aberrations  possesses characteristics similar to its normal parental line bg <dig>  <cit> . the hesc lines i <dig>  i <dig> and bg01v have been extensively characterized and tested in our laboratory for potential reference standard cell lines, because these three lines represent consensus standard human es cell lines and a karyotypically abnormal human es cell variant respectively.

immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, quantitative rt-pcr and mpss were used to assess the self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. we found that all three cell lines actively proliferated and expressed similar "stemness" and pluripotency markers and alkaline phosphatase activity. all the cell lines differentiated into phenotypes representing ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm and were directed into neural cell lineages in vitro. however, the significant differences were observed in growth rate, brdu incorporation, relative abundance of pluripotency marker expression and the ability to differentiate. these differences between the cell lines may depend on a combination of genetic, environmental and methodological factors  <cit> , implicating the importance of establishing standard protocols for hesc derivation and culture.

methods
cell culture
human embryonic stem cell lines i <dig>  i <dig>  and bg01v used in this study were cultured on mitomycin c-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts cf- <dig> . cells were cultured at 37°c, in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere, in the es medium of dulbecco's modified eagle's medium /f <dig> 80%, supplemented with  <dig>  mm l-alanyl-l-glutamine ,  <dig>  mm non-essential amino acids ,  <dig>  mm 2-mercaptoethanol  and  <dig> ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor , 5%; knockout serum replacement , 15%; fetal bovine serum , penicillin  and streptomycin  . an additional  <dig> ng/ml of bfgf was added in the first  <dig> hours after thawing the cells. daily medium changes began after the first  <dig> hours in culture. the bg01v colony formation was visible within 2– <dig> days and the other two cell line's colony formation was observed in 3– <dig> days. cells were passaged every 4– <dig> days using collagenase iv   for bg01v, i <dig> was passaged every 6– <dig> days and i <dig> was passaged every 7– <dig> days.

embryoid body formation
hescs in culture were removed from feeder cells using collagenase iv  . hesc clusters were transferred to  <dig> × 10-cm ultra-low-attachment dishes  and cultured in medium d-mem/f <dig>   supplemented with es-qualified fbs  , knockout serum replacement   , l-alanyl-l-glutamine  , non-essential amino acids  , β-mercaptoethanol  , penicillin /streptomycin  . the medium was changed every second day. to evaluate the growth rates of ebs, phase-contrast photographs of ebs were taken and the total areas of ebs were measured using scion image. the percent increase in total areas of the cell spheroids was compared between different cell lines. data were calculated as mean ± s.e.m. of at least  <dig> separate cultures. the statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test with p <  <dig>  considered significant.

directed neural differentiation of hescs
the directed neural differentiation method was described previously  <cit> . briefly, colonies of the three hesc lines i <dig>  i <dig>  bg01v were removed from mef feeders and dissociated into small clumps by incubating with collagenase iv   at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. the hesc clumps were pelleted and cultured in suspension in low attachment dishes with hesc medium without bfgf for  <dig> days . hesc grew into floating aggregates or embryoid bodies . the neuroectodermal induction began with ebs transferred into the neural differentiation medium  that consisted of two parts of a modified eagle's medium , one part f12k- , 1× n- <dig> supplement ,  <dig>  mm non-essential amino acids , penicillin /streptomycin   and  <dig> ng/ml bfgf  for  <dig> days. at days 15– <dig> of differentiation, ebs were plated on pdl/laminin substrate-coated  <dig> mm dishes . although some neural rosettes were formed in floating embryoid bodies , increased rosettes were visualized after plating of the ebs on substrates. neuroectodermal cells in rosettes were further differentiated into neural progenitors and their progeny on pdl/laminin substrates.

growth curve
to compare the growth rate between i <dig>  i <dig> and bg01v, all three hes cells were plated into  <dig> well plates containing a feeder layer of mitomycin c-treated fibroblast . the cells were cultured at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> atomosphere. basic fibroblast growth factor  was added to each cell culture after the first  <dig> hours. the medium was changed daily after  <dig> hours. the cells from three separate wells were harvested using a  <dig> %  trypsin/ <dig>  mm edta solution  each day. the cell counts were performed using cedex analysis system, innovatis. data were calculated as mean ± s.e.m. of at least  <dig> separate cultures. the statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test with p <  <dig>  considered significant.

bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation and counterstaining with propidium iodide 
to monitor cell proliferation within colonies of hes cells, bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation with 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine labeling and detection kit i  was used as described previously  <cit> . briefly, cultures were exposed to  <dig> μm brdu for  <dig> hours and then fixed with 70% alcohol containing  <dig> mm glycine at ph  <dig> . after rinsing with the kit wash buffer, cells were incubated overnight with mouse anti-brdu  followed by incubation with fitc-conjugated donkey anti-mouse igg   for  <dig> min. some cultures that were not exposed to brdu were used as negative controls which showed no immunoreactivity, demonstrating the specificity of brdu antibody. in order to quantify the cell proliferation rate, cell nuclei were counterstained by the addition of  <dig> μg/ml propidium iodide  for  <dig> min. pi+ and brdu+ cells were examined and photographed with nikon eclipse te  <dig> microscope. the proliferation index was defined as the percentage of brdu+ nuclei in the total number of pi+ cells. at least  <dig> labeled colonies were counted from each dish and three dishes were evaluated. data were calculated as mean ± s.e.m. which were statistical significance determined by using the student's t-test with p <  <dig>  considered significant.

immunocytochemistry
for the immunostaining of undifferentiated hes colonies for "stemness" markers, undifferentiated hescs were cultured on mitomycin c-treated feeder cells in  <dig> mm tissue culture dishes . colonies were rinsed twice before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde  in 1× pbs for  <dig> min at room temperature. cells were permeabilized with  <dig> % saponin  in pbs for  <dig> min. primary antibodies against oct <dig> , nanog , and ssea <dig> , and tra-1- <dig>   were incubated with colonies overnight at 4°c. the secondary antibodies used were either, alexa fluor  <dig> conjugated goat anti-mouse igg , , or fitc-conjugated donkey anti-mouse igm , or alexa flour 488-conjugated rabbit anti-goat igg <dig> . colonies were incubated with secondary antibodies for  <dig> min at room temperature.

immunostaining of hesc-derived neural cells for nestin and tuj <dig> were performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, neural differentiation medium-treated eb were plated on pdl/laminin coated  <dig> mm tissue culture plates . differentiated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in  <dig> % saponin as described above. primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-nestin, 1: <dig>  mouse anti-tubulin clone tuj- <dig>  1: <dig>  chicken anti-sox <dig>  1: <dig>  . secondary antibodies used were either rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti- rabbit igg- , alexa fluor  <dig> conjugated goat anti-mouse- igg   or fitc-conjugated donkey anti-chicken igg . cells were counterstained with the 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  with dilution of 1: <dig> . immunofluorescence signals were observed and photographed with a nikon te  <dig> epifluorescence microscope  equipped with a qicam fast <dig> digital camera  and openlab vs.  <dig> . <dig> software .

to quantify the percentage of hesc-differentiated neural progenitors, cell counting was performed on cultures immunostained for nestin, together with nuclear dapi counterstaining, in  <dig> mm culture dishes coated with different laminin substrates from at least three independent experiments. all data were expressed as mean ± sem, and student's t test was used for statistical evaluation. in all instances p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

alkaline phosphatase staining
endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity in bg01v, i <dig> and i <dig> cells was detected using the elf®  <dig> endogenous alkaline phosphatase detection kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. cells cultured in  <dig> well plates  were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. the cells were washed with 1× pbs, treated with  <dig> % tween- <dig> for  <dig> minutes at room temperature and rinsed with 1× pbs. fixed cells were then incubated with a filtered 1: <dig> dilution of the phosphatase substrate in situ, and the reaction was monitored using an epifluorescence microscope. the reaction was terminated using a stop solution consisting of pbs,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm levamisole, ph  <dig> . cells were rinsed with pbs before mounting on glass microscope slides.

qrt-pcr
total rna was isolated from three hesc lines i <dig>  i <dig>  and bg01v using an rnaeasy plus mini kit . the isolated rnas were quantified using a rna  <dig> nano kit . the integrity of rna was checked on agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . equal amounts of rna  was taken for all samples and reverse transcription was done using rt <dig> first strand kit from superarray biosciences  pph02394a, pph02391a and pph17032a, keratin c and nefl  pph-21369a and pph02430a, alpha-globin and beta-globin  pph09054a and pph12971a, alpha-1at pph02413a, nestin and musashi  <dig>  sox <dig>  pph02388a, pph13090a and pph02390a, map <dig>  gad- <dig>  pph02419a, ppho5950a, s100b and gfap  pph02408a and pph02472a; . the thermocycler parameters were 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> min. each gene for each sample was run in quadruplicate. relative changes in gene expression were calculated using the ΔΔct  method. this method first subtracts the ct  of the gene-avg ct of the two house keeping genes  to normalize to the rna amounts. finally, the delta delta ct is calculated by subtracting the normalized average ct of the treated cells from the normalized average ct of the undifferentiated cells. then this delta ct is raised to the negative power of  <dig> in order to calculate the fold change  <cit> .

massively parallel signature sequencing
massively parallel signature sequencing  was performed using 1– <dig> μg purified total rna from each of the three human esc lines  from undifferentiated cells  and cells at different stages of differentiation ; the presence and absence of esc markers and markers of differentiation were evaluated. the quality of total rnas was evaluated using an agilent bioanalyzer. mrna isolation was processed according to the mpss protocol as described previously  <cit>  with some modification. in brief, the mrna was reverse-transcribed, the cdna synthesized and digested with dpnii, then gex adaptors ligated with dpnii and amplified by pcr, the cdna library was ready to sequence. the abundance for each signature was converted to transcripts per million  for the purpose of comparison between samples. only reliable and annotatable signatures against updated human signature database were considered for further analysis.

to generate a complete, annotated human signature database, all the possible signatures from the human genome sequence, the human unigene sequences, and human mitochondrion were extracted. each virtual signature was ranked based on its position and orientation in the original sequence. the annotation database is established based on the virtual signatures, their classes and their corresponding genes so that each signature only has one corresponding annotation. the database is then used to annotate the data from the experiment.

RESULTS
different hesc lines exhibit different colony morphologies
undifferentiated hesc lines bg01v, i <dig> and i <dig> that had been maintained on mitomycin c-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts  for 4– <dig> days displayed distinct cell colony morphologies. cells in the center regions of colonies exhibited prominent nucleoli and a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. cells from bg01v  and i <dig>  lines were highly compact with rather vague borders . their colonies exhibited a round and sharp edge separating the hesc from surrounding feeder cells. in contrast, colonies of i <dig> cell line  exhibited a mosaic appearance with loosely packed cells . this observation is consistent with previous descriptions  <cit> .

differences in growth curves between undifferentiated hesc lines
to examine potential differences in the ability to self-renew between the three hesc lines, the percent increase in cell numbers relative to cell numbers at day  <dig> were calculated up to  <dig> days . the relative growth was determined, followed by the plating of approxmately  <dig> cells on a mef feeder, and trypsinized cells were counted using a cedex analysis system. the differences in the cell number between each cell lines should represent the differences in relative growth of hescs since the fibroblast feeder cells were mitomycin c-treated. the growth curves in figure 1d show significant differences in percent increase in the number of cells at day  <dig> in culture between the three cell lines. i <dig> and bg01v cell colonies reached an average size of 300– <dig> cells for splitting at 5– <dig> days after passaging. in contrast, i <dig> cells grew slower than the other two cell lines and were not ready to passage until culture day  <dig>  it appeared more difficult to maintain the i <dig> cell line in an undifferentiated state since it had more tendency to differentiate.

mpss expression analysis of three human esc lines
after full annotation of over one million sequenced signatures from each esc line, there were  <dig>   <dig> human unigene clusters detected by mpss in the three human undifferentiated esc lines . i <dig> expressed the most genes  and i <dig> expressed the fewest genes ; bgo1v cells expressed  <dig>   <dig>  although the differences in numbers of total expressed gene numbers among the three esc lines was significant, the number of core transcriptome expression of the three hesc lines were substantial:  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of i <dig> genes were expressed in i <dig> and bgo1v, respectively, and 92%  genes of i <dig> were co-expressed in the other two lines . these findings indicate that different hesc lines retain core transcriptome features of embryonic "stemness".

all undifferentiated hesc lines express pluripotency markers, but their gene expression levels are variable
the undifferentiated state of human es cells was first characterized by immunocytochemistry. all the three hesc lines expressed glycolipid antigens such as stage-specific embryonic antigen ssea- <dig>  tumor rejection antigen tra-1- <dig>  and transcription factors oct-3/ <dig> and nanog as described previously  <cit> . all cell lines also exhibited alkaline phosphatase  activity . to further study the quantitative expression of pluripotency markers, quantitative rt-pcr and mpss were used to assay the expression of a series of genes in each of the three undifferentiated hesc lines  and in their differentiated eb. we cross validated the results of quantitative rt-pcr and mpss analysis of the expression levels of undifferentiated hesc marker genes  in the three hesc lines over time.

the y-axis plots the fold change of the undifferentiated i <dig> and bgo1v cell lines in comparison to the undifferentiated i <dig> cell line. the expression level of the undifferentiated genes implicates that the i <dig> hes cells express much lower levels of "stemness"  genes compared to the i <dig> and bg01v cell lines .

differences in brdu incorporation between undifferentiated i <dig>  i <dig> and bg01v cells
to examine the potential difference in the ability to proliferate between different the hesc lines, bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation assays were performed in colonies of i <dig>  i <dig> and bg01v cells . hesc maintained on the mef for  <dig> days under the same conditions were incubated with brdu for  <dig> h before being processed for brdu immunocytochemistry . cells were counterstained with pi which stained nuclei of all cells . we indexed proliferation for each cell line by quantifying the proportion of brdu+ cells versus the total number of cells . at  <dig> days post-passaging, all three cell lines showed active dna synthesis, but the i <dig> cell line exhibited significantly smaller colonies and a lower proliferation rate compared to the other two cell lines . unlike the i <dig> and bg01v cell colonies within which brdu+ cells were confined, some brdu+ cells were scattered outside of the i <dig> colonies, although the majority of brdu+ cells were located within the colonies . the scattered brdu+ cells may represent individual proliferative i <dig> cells on the mef layer before forming a colony, indicating much slower proliferation in the i <dig> cells compared to the i <dig> and bg01v cells. cell counting showed differences in brdu incorporation between the three cell lines. bg01v cells exhibited highest brdu incorporation levels , while i <dig> cells had the lowest levels  . the proliferation rate in i <dig> cells was 78% ±  <dig> %. the difference between three cell lines in brdu incorporation was consistent with the sizes  of the colonies. at  <dig> days in culture i <dig> cells exhibited smaller colonies with a lower proliferation index compared to the bg01v and i <dig> cells. colonies of the i <dig> and bg01v cells exhibited higher numbers of active dna synthesizing cells compared to the i <dig> cells.

embryoid body formation and growth rate vary among the three hesc lines
eb represents a unique tool to investigate in vitro differentiation processes of hescs. colonies of the three esc lines were removed from feeder cells and grown as cell aggregates in a suspension in low attachment dishes without basic fibroblast growth factor. the growth rate of the ebs was calculated by the increase of eb size  in every  <dig> days period from days  <dig> though  <dig> . the percent increase in size of the cell spheroids was significantly different in the ebs from the three different hesc lines after  <dig> days in the suspension culture . the relative eb growth was greater in the i <dig> and bg01v cells compared to the i <dig> cells.

all three hesc lines are able to differentiate into cells expressing markers of all three germ layers and neural cells
eb formation is a model of in vitro embryogenesis in which all three primary embryonic germ cell lineages are generated  <cit> . to examine differences in the gene expression of the three germ layer markers in ebs derived from three esc lines, we assessed the expression of keratin c  and alpha-globin  by qrt-pcr , and expression of alpha fp  and igf <dig>  by mpss . the fold changes  in the expression levels of keratin c and alpha-globin for each cell line relative to its own undifferentiated levels showed that the i <dig> cell line expressed markedly higher levels of these two genes at  <dig> and  <dig> days when compared to the i <dig> and bg01v cell lines . mpss results showed that the i <dig> cell line expressed higher levels of both alpha fp and igf- <dig> than the i <dig> and bg01v cell lines .

since a primitive neural stem cell stage can be acquired though a default mechanism  <cit> , we assessed the expression levels of the neural markers, nestin and musashi  <dig> , map <dig>  and s100b  by qrt-pcr and mpss . qrt-pcr analysis showed differences in expression levels of these genes between the three hes cell lines. the i <dig> and i <dig> cells expressed higher levels of neural progenitor-specific genes  , as well as neuronal gene  and glial gene   than bg01v cells. both map <dig> and s100b genes were upgraded from day  <dig> to day  <dig> in culture in the i <dig> and i <dig> cells.

differences in expression of neural phenotypes and genes in directed neural differentiation between three hesc lines
differences in pluripotency between the three cell lines were also examined during the directed neural differentiation. to test the possible differences we used a reliable step-wise differentiation protocol  which generated highly pure neural progenitors from the i <dig> and i <dig> cells  <cit> . the hesc colonies were removed from mef feeders and cultured in suspension in low attachment dishes with hesc medium without bfgf for  <dig> days . differentiating ebs were transferred into the neural differentiation medium for  <dig> days. at days 15– <dig> of differentiation, ebs were plated on poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated  <dig> mm dishes. neural rosettes were visualized after plating of the ebs on the substrate . neuroectodermal cells in neural rosettes were stained for sox <dig> and nestin , and further differentiated into neural progenitors and their progeny . under the same neural differentiation-promoting condition, we quantified the percentage of hesc-differentiated neural progenitors by immunostaining for nestin, together with nuclear dapi counterstaining . nestin+ cells were manually counted and were expressed as a percentage of the total dapi labeled cells . a significant difference was found in the percentage increase in number of nestin+ cells differentiated from the three cell lines after  <dig> days post plating . the percentage increase in nestin+ cells generated from the i <dig> cells was greater than that of the i <dig> cells. the bg01v generated undetectable or an insignificant number of neural progenitors which were lightly scattered among differentiated cells. in addition, we tracked the appearance of neural rosettes during neural differentiation and found that the i3-derived rosettes were generated 5– <dig> days earlier than the i6-derived neural rosettes. the bg01v-derived neural rosettes were barely detected.

to assess differences in the gene expression during neural differentiation between the three cell lines, total rna was harvested from the ebs at  <dig> days post plating on poly-d-lysine/laminin substrates. the qrt-pcr analysis of the expression levels for the neural progenitor markers sox <dig> and msi <dig>  the mature neuron marker map <dig>  and the astrocyte marker gfap showed that the all these genes were strongly expressed in the i <dig> cells . the y-axis plots the fold changes of gene expression for each cell line when compared to its own undifferentiated levels at day  <dig>  the high levels of expression for the neural progenitor genes sox <dig> and msi <dig> in the i <dig> and i <dig> cells were consistent with their high expression of nestin immunoreactivity .

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrated that although all the three hesc lines i <dig>  i <dig> and bg01v can maintain their ability to proliferate and give rise to the progeny of the three embryonic germ layers, their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities are variable. the overall gene expression profiles of the three lines were similar; however, in most cases, the relative abundance of expression of the same "stemness" and differentiation genes were highly variable between the cell lines. we also found that under the same neural induction conditions, the ability of each of the three lines to differentiate into neural progenitors was also distinct. previous studies that compared hesc lines focused on the expression of pluripotency and the differentiation marker genes  <cit> . in the present study, in addition to the variable gene expression in undifferentiated and eb differentiated states, we detected a profound variation in the cell growth rate, brdu incorporation and the directed neural differentiation.

the work presented here is part of continuing efforts to develop a database of the properties and behaviors of different hesc lines and to understand the similarities and differences between individual hes cell lines by side-by-side comparison. this comparative analysis of individually-derived hesc lines is critical, because the properties and behavior of each line are uniquely shaped by their histories. it has become clear that different derivations produce hesc lines that are similar with regards to "stemness", but with inherent differences in gene expression, methylation status, x chromosome inactivation, rate of self-renewal and the ability to differentiate  <cit> . more importantly, the behavior of cells and their overall state changes as culture conditions and the stress they are subjected to is altered, and permanent genomic changes frequently occur as passage numbers increase  <cit> . variability in genetic, environmental and methodological factors has led to a great difficulty in comparing results of studies of the hesc lines among laboratories.

in this study, our side-by-side comparison between the three hesc lines was made under the same culture conditions in an effort to minimize the influences of environmental and methodological factors. the differences we found between the three cell lines may be due to the genetic variation and epigenetically inherited alterations from previous culture history. lines i <dig> and i <dig> were derived in the same laboratory but differ in sex  <cit> . bg01v is a variant cell line with an abnormal karyotype  <cit> . another factor that may contribute to the cell line differences is the variation in passage number between the three cell lines. it is more challenging to directly compare differences in directed differentiation between different human es cell lines because the differentiation protocols most likely are cell line-specific. previous study has shown that the reliable dopaminergic differentiation was induced by co-culture with the mouse stromal cell line pa <dig>  <cit> . however, in the present study, under culture conditions that favored neural differentiation of the i <dig> and i <dig> cells, the bg01v barely produced neural progenitors and expressed much fewer neural-specific genes compared to i <dig> and i <dig> cells. the inconsistency in bg01v cell neural differentiation data between zeng's and our studies points out that each hes cell line needs an optimized protocol for a specific phenotype differentiation.

hesc lines have a great potential to provide new research tools that support clinical applications. the frequency of non-obvious changes in the hesc behavior and potency is of great concern for the future of cell replacement therapies. physicians who transplant hesc-derived cells into patients must be in confident as to the safety and stability of the cells they use. thus it is necessary not only to establish a set of characterization tests which are sensitive enough to detect small but harmful changes, but these tests must also be simple and inexpensive enough to be used routinely. the comparison made in this study also shows that the individually derived hesc lines from different laboratories are variable to various extents. therefore reference standards, such as cell lines that provide consistent, predictable results and are not difficult to culture are needed. we believe that the database of hesc characterization data and standard reference materials will permit the research community to readily monitor and compare hesc lines.

CONCLUSIONS
our side-by-side comparison confirms the general finding that hesc lines share the properties of self-renewal, expression of "stemness" and pluripotency markers and the ability to differentiate, but many differences remain between cell lines. these differences include the ability to maintain an undifferentiated state, to self-renew, and to differentiate. in addition to inherited variation in the sex, stage, quality and genetic background of embryos used for hesc line derivation, these differences may be associated with derivation methods and changes acquired during passaging in culture. to this end, it is important to set up standards shared by multiple laboratories for routine analysis of undifferentiated state , identity, stability, pluripotency and sterility of hesc lines.
