BACKGROUND
deoxynivalenol  is a secondary metabolite produced by some fusarium species of fungi. don belongs to the trichothecene group of mycotoxins characterized by the  <dig> -epoxy-trichothec-9-ene ring system. it has been shown that the  <dig> -epoxide group on the trichothecene nucleus of don is mainly responsible for its toxicity  <cit> . the toxin causes clinical symptoms including feed refusal, vomiting, lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, immunosuppression and lack of muscle coordination in domestic animals  <cit> . don contamination often occurs when weather is conducive to the infection of cereal crops by fusarium fungi and is commonly found worldwide on corn, wheat, barley, and other grains. contamination of grains by don poses an increasingly serious threat to livestock production and human health. despite a plethora of information regarding the biochemistry, toxicity, and modes of action of mycotoxins, it still remains a challenge to control/eradicate don either pre- or post- harvest  <cit> . the industries are facing an even greater challenge due to the increased incidence of fusarium ear rot of corn and the competition for corn from the emerging biofuel industry  <cit> . therefore, effective methods to control mycotoxin contamination are urgently needed.

the prevention of mycotoxin production and detoxification of mycotoxins are the two main strategies for control of mycotoxin contamination. while physical and chemical techniques have been largely used to detoxify don, breeding for fusarium-resistant plants and preharvest use of fungicides are the main strategies for the prevention  <cit> . biological detoxification has also been a choice for postharvest treatment because of its advantages in efficiency, specificity, and environmental soundness. a de-epoxy metabolite of don, resulting from enzymatic reduction of the  <dig> -epoxy-group to a diene, was identified from rat urine and faeces and first described by yoshizawa et al.  <cit> . the de-epoxy don, called de-don or dom- <dig> in the literature, has been proven to be much less toxic than don  <cit> . biotransformation of don by microbial cells or enzymes is particularly attractive  <cit> . in the past two and half decades, transformation of don by mixed microorganisms from animal intestines has been studied  <cit> . one significant study showed that don incubated in vitro with the contents of the large intestine of chicken  disappeared within  <dig> hr  <cit> . subsequently, it was confirmed that microorganisms in clic were able to completely transform don to dom- <dig> and the activity was retained through  <dig> serial subcultures  <cit> . the transformation of don and the significant reduction in its toxicity was demonstrated by a pig feeding experiment  <cit> . both in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown that don can be transformed to dom- <dig> by intestinal microorganisms of other animal species including cow, rat, sheep, and pig  <cit> . although mixed microorganisms from animal intestines often demonstrated the ability to transform don to dom- <dig>  isolation of don-transforming microorganisms to a pure culture has been a great challenge. there have been only a few reports on don transformation by a pure bacterial culture  <cit> ; only one of these cases thus far, eubacterium sp., isolated from the rumen  <cit> , has been systematically studied. it appears that the lack of pure cultures of transforming bacteria has limited the full implementation of biological detoxification strategies. the present research was conducted to select don-transforming bacteria from the chicken intestines with potential application in the management of mycotoxin risks.

RESULTS
in vivo enrichment
the effect of feeding don-contaminated wheat on the enrichment of don-transforming bacteria in the chicken intestines was initially investigated. digesta samples from the large intestine  of layers fed don-contaminated wheat were able to completely transform don in the medium to dom- <dig> after incubation. however, only 80% don on average  was transformed by the digesta samples from the layers fed clean wheat. similar results were obtained with the digesta samples from the small intestine .

effect of media
different media were examined initially for their effect on the activity of don transformation and also on the bacterial growth of digesta samples. among the tested media including aim, aim+cecext, l <dig>  mrs, rb, vl, and dam, only l <dig> and aim+cecext fully supported the transformation of don to dom- <dig> . while bacterial cultures could be rapidly established in l <dig> broth, the growth of bacteria in aim + cecext was minimal. these two media were therefore used for subsequent selection for don-transforming bacteria, depending on the aim of particular experiments.

don-transforming activity of digesta samples and their subcultures
the level of don-transforming activity in the digesta samples collected from the crop, small and large intestines of chickens fed don-contaminated or clean wheat was determined. among  <dig> chickens examined, 92% lic  and 50% sic  samples transformed don to dom- <dig> completely after  <dig> hr incubation. however, only 25%  samples from the chicken crop demonstrated a partial activity in transforming don to dom- <dig>  after  <dig> hr incubation.

the lic digesta samples collected from the chickens fed don-contaminated or clean wheat were also examined for their activity of don transformation during subculturing  in l <dig> broth. the first two subcultures retained a high activity in transforming don. however, the activity declined significantly from the third passage on .

selection for don-transforming bacteria
when individual antibiotics were tested for bacterial selection , virginiamycin, lincomycin, and tylosin showed no detrimental effect on either the activity of don transformation or bacterial growth of the start cultures at all tested concentrations . however, a similar effect was observed only at the low concentration  of streptomycin, penicillin g, and salinomycin. different combinations of these antibiotics were then investigated for their effect on supporting the activity of don transformation and the growth of bacterial cells. only one combination containing virginiamycin , lincomycin , and salinomycin  significantly reduced the growth of bacterial cells without detrimental effect on the don-transforming activity. hence, the cultures selected through this combination were used for further selection by the aim+cecext medium.

the previously selected cultures were diluted 10-fold in series, inoculated in the aim+cecext medium, incubated for  <dig> hr, and then examined for don-transforming activity . among the serially diluted cultures , the diluted cultures in 10- <dig>  10- <dig>  or 10- <dig> all completely transformed don to dom- <dig> in the medium. however, the diluted cultures in 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> demonstrated a partial activity of don transformation with  <dig> and 24% of don transformed to dom- <dig>  respectively. the process was repeated until the cultures had their cell density reduced to  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  but still retained full activity of don transformation prior to single colony isolation on l <dig> agar. sixty eight and  <dig> single colonies were isolated from the diluted sic and lic cultures, respectively, and ten isolates  were found to be capable of transforming don to dom- <dig> . one of the isolates was from the small intestine and the remaining from the large intestine.

pcr-dgge bacterial profiles were used to guide the selection for don-transforming bacteria in this study. fig.  <dig> displays examples to show the effectiveness of pcr-dgge bacterial profiles in guiding the bacterial selection. the large intestinal digesta sample  had many more dna bands than the start culture  that was a subculture from the digesta, indicating the selective effect of subculturing. it was described above that tylosin had no detrimental effect on either don transformation or bacterial growth of the start cultures at all tested concentrations. however, the treatment showed little influence over the richness of bacterial populations, as indicated by the similarity of pcr-dgge bacterial profiles before and after tylosin treatment . thus no further experiments were pursued with the resulting cultures. in contrast to tylosin, treatment with lincomycin significantly reduced the richness of bacterial populations indicated by the reduction of dgge dna bands , but did not affect don transformation. the resulting cultures were subsequently used for further bacterial selection. panel b shows the changes in the richness of bacterial populations during the selection process for don-transforming bacteria. the number of dgge dna bands decreased during the process of selection until a single colony isolate was obtained, which demonstrated a single major dna band in the dgge gel .

identification of don-transforming bacterial isolates
the sequence similarity analysis of partial 16s rrna genes  of the  <dig> isolates with don-transforming activity indicated that they belonged to four different bacterial groups, clostridiales, anaerofilum, collinsella, and bacillus . isolates within the same group had sequence similarities greater than 99%. however, isolates located in different groups showed sequence similarities less than 85%. one isolate, named ls- <dig>  had 99% similarity in the partial sequence of 16s rrna gene compared with that of bacillus arbutinivorans.

stability of don-transforming activity of the isolates during subculturing
the stability of the  <dig> bacterial isolates in don transformation during subculturing in l <dig> broth was examined. six out of the  <dig> isolates retained 100% of the activity over the six passages of subculturing . however, the activity of isolates ls- <dig> and ss- <dig> disappeared after  <dig> to  <dig> passages of the subculturing. in contrast, isolates ls- <dig> and ls- <dig> initially demonstrated partial activity of don transformation, but their activity was fully developed  through  <dig> to  <dig> passages of subculturing. isolate ls- <dig> was transferred for four additional passages. it retained full activity during the additional passages regardless of the presence or absence of don in the medium.

discussion
the application of microbial transformation of mycotoxins has been largely limited in the past by the unavailability of microbial agents. although the animal intestine has been frequently shown to be a habitat for bacteria, isolation of pure bacterium with transformation capability has remained a great challenge due to the large number of microorganisms  in the animal intestine and the complexity of intestinal microbiota. he et al.  <cit>  described a high activity of mixed microorganisms from the chicken large intestine in transforming don. however, they were unable to purify the microorganisms. the present study describes an approach using pcr-dgge bacterial profiles to guide the selection of don-transforming bacteria through the use of conventional microbiology techniques. the integration of pcr-dgge bacterial profiling into the selection has significantly improved our efficiency in selecting desired bacteria. with this integrated approach, a microbial community with don-transforming activity was effectively reduced to only  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> from the level of 1011- <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  the approach has provided a success rate of approximately 5% . this is much more efficient than traditional blind screenings. for example, only one active colony was obtained after screening thousands of colonies using a traditional approach alone in a previous study  <cit> . thus, the approach developed in the present study can be used as a common strategy for bacterial selection. this is the first report of a successful isolation of pure cultures of don-transforming bacteria from the chicken intestine using a dna bacterial profiling-guided selection. also, the research has clearly demonstrated that one of the selected isolates  is highly consistent and potent in the transformation of don and transformation of other trichothecene mycotoxins  <cit> . it is worth pointing out that isolate ss- <dig> was selected from the small intestine. considering that this isolate may offer an advantage in colonizing the small intestine, a region with high physiological significance for animal nutrition, more studies are warranted. in summary, the isolation of pure cultures of don-transforming bacteria has provided a good opportunity for biotransformation research and applications including physiology underlying the transformation and development of microbial or enzyme products for field application.

the sequence data of partial 16s rrna genes indicate that the  <dig> selected isolates with don-transforming activity belong to four bacterial groups. this diversity may give the host an advantage to ensure the consistency of don-transformation in the chicken intestine  <cit> . despite taxonomic distance between the isolates, they share similar don transformation function. during the in vitro selection with don as the sole carbon source in the mineral medium , don-transforming bacteria were unable to utilize don as a source of carbon and energy, and therefore there was no effect of enrichment. however, the desired bacteria were enriched when the nutritional requirement was met, evidenced by both in vivo and in vitro enrichment. this suggests that don-transforming bacteria may have an advantage in competition in the intestinal environment when don is present. furthermore, all the isolates demonstrated the same function of transforming don to dom- <dig> by deepoxidation. isolates ss- <dig> and ls- <dig> have been further studied and shown to degrade other trichothecene mycotoxins by deepoxidation and/or deacetylation  <cit> . the results are in agreement with the report by fuchs et al.  <cit> , in which pure cultures of eutacterium sp. isolated from the rumen have been studied. it is unclear at present if all the isolates have an identical enzyme or isoenzymes for their don-transforming activity. purification and characterization of the enzyme and cloning of the genes encoding the enzymes will lead to a clarification.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of pcr-dgge guided microbial selection in this study has significantly increased the efficiency for isolating don-transforming bacteria. the obtained bacterial isolates were able to detoxify don, which allows further studies for both basic research and application in biotransformation of this mycotoxin.
