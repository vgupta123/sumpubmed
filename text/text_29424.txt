BACKGROUND
the coxibs are a class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  which selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase - <dig>  whilst sparing cox- <dig> activity. they were developed to provide analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions with greater safety than conventional nsaids, which are usually non-selective inhibitors  <cit> . nevertheless, concerns over the renal safety coxibs have been raised  <cit> . indeed, acute kidney injury, marked sodium retention and exacerbation of systemic hypertension have been reported with the use of cox- <dig> selective drugs in humans  <cit> .

cox isoforms exert key roles in the regulation of renal function through the production of protective prostaglandins e <dig> and prostacyclin)  <cit> . cox- <dig> is expressed in several renal cell types and is responsible for maintaining renal blood flow by attenuating vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole  through pge <dig> or prostacyclin released locally  <cit> . therefore, cox- <dig> inhibition by nsaids may precipitate ischaemic renal injury and decrease glomerular filtration rate  in hypovolaemic patients.

in several species cox- <dig> is constitutively expressed in a limited number of kidney cell types: the macula densa  and cortical thick ascending loop and medullary interstitial cells  <cit> . the degree of renal cox- <dig> expression varies with age and disease state  <cit> , when renal homeostasis may become “prostaglandin dependent”. restricted cox- <dig> expression suggests differing functional roles in the cortex and medulla. indeed, prostanoids derived from medullary cox are essential in promoting natriuresis  <cit> , whereas cortical cox regulates renin release, which maintains gfr despite fluctuations in systemic arterial blood pressure  <cit> . moreover, activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system  stabilises arterial blood pressure and blood volume through vasoconstriction and increases sodium and water retention.

the reliance of renin release on cox- <dig> was demonstrated healthy human volunteers given furosemide  together with celecoxib  or indomethacin   <cit> . we do not know much about effects of cox inhibition in the feline kidney or the role of each isoenzyme in mediating natriuresis and raas activation or on the localisation of cox expression in cats with normal kidney function. such information has clinical safety implications, as nsaids are used to treat pain in cats of all ages with normal or decreased plasma volume.

the aim of the present study was to elucidate localisation of cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> and identify their roles in stimulating renin secretion, secondary to a furosemide challenge in healthy cats. of nsaids licensed for cats, two have differing cox-isoenzyme selectivities: robenacoxib  is a selective cox- <dig> inhibitor  <cit> , whereas ketoprofen  is a selective cox- <dig> inhibitor  <cit> . the study objectives were:  to determine the effects of cox- <dig>  and cox- <dig>  inhibition on furosemide-induced changes in the healthy cats, namely  diuretic and saluretic responses,  gfr regulation,  raas activation and  possible nephrotoxicity;  to identify cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> immunolocalization in kidneys from cats with normal renal function.

discussion
this is the first study to report the acute renal effects of cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> selective nsaids, administered at clinically recommended doses in combination with furosemide to healthy conscious cats.

validation of the furosemide model
furosemide  produced reliable diuretic and saluretic responses and stimulated the raas .

non-selective and cox- <dig> selective nsaids cause sodium retention in healthy humans  <cit> . moreover, non-selective nsaids attenuate in vitro the furosemide-induced reduction in loop chloride reabsorption  <cit> . they also compete with furosemide for the organic acid transporter in proximal tubular cells, limiting its access to nak2cl transporters  <cit> . in the present study, there was no inhibitory effect of acute nsaid administration on the diuretic and saluretic actions of furosemide; therefore electrolyte homeostasis in the cat may be regulated by mechanisms over-riding the acute cox blockade.

link between furosemide administration and increase in pra
there are two possible mechanisms to explain increased renin activity in response to furosemide in the present study  <cit> . first, by blocking nak2cl transporter, furosemide removes the link between chloride concentration in the md and renin secretion. consequently, the md signal for renin secretion persists regardless of the amount nacl passing through the distal tubule  <cit> , accounting for the increase in pra. in these circumstances, basolateral cells of the md of rabbit perfused kidneys increased cox- <dig> and pge <dig> synthase expression  <cit> . the resulting pge <dig> release constitutes the physiological mechanism of signal transmission from md cells to the jga  <cit> . this response regulates renin release and renal vascular resistance. using a similar experimental setting to the present study, furosemide-induced renin release was blocked by cox- <dig> inhibitors in humans  <cit> . second, the later occurring action of furosemide  is to reduce stimulation of the afferent arteriolar stretch receptors and carotid / aortic sinus baroreceptors, thus stimulating renin release  <cit> .

effects of nsaids on raas
ketoprofen significantly attenuated the furosemide-induced ten-fold increase in pra in in this study, whereas the effect of robenacoxib was equivocal and probably dose dependent. an unavoidable limitation of the study is that ketoprofen  inhibits not only cox- <dig> for 24 h, but also cox- <dig> for  <dig> to 11 h after oral administration . hence, attenuation of the pra response may be due to inhibition of cox- <dig> or requires inhibition of both isoforms. inhibition of cox- <dig> alone was insufficient to suppress this response. to elucidate the relative importance of cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> in mediating the pra response to furosemide administration requires the use of a highly selective cox- <dig> inhibitor; no such compound is currently available.

aldosterone release from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex is controlled by angiotensin ii in circumstances of renal hypo-perfusion and increase in plasma potassium. plasma potassium concentration did not change significantly in this study , although the fractional excretion of potassium increased with all treatments, commensurate with the decrease in gfr. plasma aldosterone concentration fluctuates over the course of the day, as aldosterone release can be affected by several factors, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone , body position, hyponatremia and atrial natriuretic peptide  <cit> . in the present study, the minor stress associated with restraint and blood sampling could have exerted an acute effect on acth and plasma aldosterone concentrations. the high inter-animal variability could account for the lack of significance of the numerical increase in plasma aldosterone after any of the treatment. aldosterone excretion in urine collected over 24 h is, therefore, likely to provide a better indication of time-averaged aldosterone release than spot plasma aldosterone concentration measurement. urinary aldosterone response was suppressed by both ketoprofen and twice daily robenacoxib and to a lesser extent by once daily robenacoxib. this supports a role for cox- <dig> but suggests that cox- <dig> is also involved in aldosterone secretion, as ketoprofen inhibited urinary aldosterone more than either dose of robenacoxib. furthermore, the urinary aldosterone data are consistent with the pra data, supporting the view that inhibition of both cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> is required to block the effect of furosemide in activating raas.

immunochemistry evidence for cox- <dig> and  <dig> in furosemide-induced pra response
evidence for cox- <dig>  and potentially also for cox- <dig>  involvement in signalling from the md cells to the renin secreting cells of the jga, was obtained by immunohistochemistry, which demonstrated high level expression of cox- <dig> and weak expression of cox- <dig> within the md of both young and older adult cats. in other species, the use of immunohistochemistry to localise cox-isoforms has demonstrated species and age-related differences in expression. only cox- <dig> has been localised to the md in most species, including dogs, rabbits and rats  <cit> , but with both isoforms identified in mice  <cit> . distribution of the isoenzymes in the other compartments of the feline kidney is similar to that seen in rodents, rabbits and dogs  <cit> . in humans, cox- <dig> expression is reported in the md in the foetus  <cit>  and in subjects over 50 years of age  <cit> , hence the inclusion of two age groups of cats in the present study. kidney tissue was obtained from cats undergoing post-mortem examination for reasons other than ckd. these cats cannot, therefore, be described as healthy, and other features of their disease process might have altered renal tissue cox-enzyme expression. nevertheless, the data indicate that cox- <dig> is the principal isoform present in cells of the feline md, whilst the finding of weak expression of cox- <dig> at this location suggests that interaction between the two isoforms may generate the signal to the jga cells from the md to secrete renin in some cats. this interpretation of the immunohistochemistry data is strengthened by the results of the functional studies which suggest involvement of both cox isoenzymes in signalling from md to jga to stimulate renin secretion.

vascular effects of furosemide and nsaids
in the placebo group, the significant increase in plasma creatinine and slight but non-significant increases in packed cell volume and total protein suggest contraction of the volume of the central compartment by furosemide  <cit> . this may have led to reduced tonic stimulation of either the stretch receptors of the afferent arteriole or the cardiac or arterial baroreceptors, leading to release of renin, angiotensin ii and aldosterone. however, systolic arterial blood pressure was not measured and therefore a baroreceptor mechanism cannot be confirmed. altered stretch of afferent arteriole wall activates raas and the release of angiotensin ii and aldosterone, leading to increased sodium reabsorption. offset of the vasoconstrictive action of angiotensin ii on the afferent arteriole and preservation of gfr is dependent on the local release of prostaglandins  <cit> . gfr was significantly decreased with ketoprofen and approached significance for robenacoxib ; it is therefore possible that the cox- <dig> dependent raas response to volume depletion was blunted with ketoprofen, accounting for the lesser effect of robenacoxib on furosemide-induced pra increase.

effects of furosemide and nsaids on urinary eicosanoids
urinary eicosanoid excretion derives from local renal production. the effect of furosemide on urinary pge <dig> excretion varies with species. it was unchanged in humans  <cit>  but increased in dogs  <cit> . surprisingly, in the present study furosemide reduced pge <dig> excretion, probably through inhibition of pge <dig> production. against this background, it was not possible to relate pge <dig> inhibition by nsaids to their action on furosemide-induced renin secretion. however, ketoprofen further reduced urinary pge <dig> excretion, possibly indicating that renal cox- <dig> is the major source of urinary pge <dig> in the cat. attenuation of the furosemide increased urinary txb <dig> excretion by ketoprofen and twice daily robenacoxib, compared to placebo, indicates that furosemide-induced renal txb <dig> synthesis is probably the consequence of a cox- <dig> mediated compensatory vasoconstrictive mechanism.

effects of furosemide and nsaids on urinary protein excretion
in dogs, increase in nag index is associated with renal proximal tubular necrosis  <cit> . furosemide significantly increased urinary nag activity in all groups in the present study and the increases were not exacerbated by concomitant nsaid treatment. for all cats, nag returned to baseline levels during the intervals between periods, indicating either a transient nephrotoxic effect of furosemide or, more likely, an increased lysosomal turnover in response to the increase in tubular fluid flow  <cit> .

methods
in vivo study design
seven neutered experimental cats , weighing  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg, were enrolled in a four period crossover study. they were group housed except during sampling periods when they were individually housed in cages equipped with a timed urine collection system previously validated in cats  <cit> . each cat was fed 25 g of a low sodium dry food twice daily . drinking water was available ad libitum. the study complied with the eu directive 2010/63/eu  and the protocol was approved by the royal veterinary college ethics and welfare committee. all cats were declared healthy at the end of the study and subsequently re-homed.

at the beginning of each period, a pooled baseline urine sample was collected over 48 h during days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . a baseline blood sample  was collected in the middle of the urinary collection interval . the treatments comprised administration of furosemide 2 mg/kg  orally twice daily  from the morning of day  <dig> to the morning of day  <dig>  concomitantly with one of four nsaid/placebo dosing regimens :  robenacoxib  once daily;  robenacoxib  twice daily;  ketoprofen once daily ; and  placebo once daily . robenacoxib tablets composition was  <dig>  %  active ingredient,  <dig>  % microcryst. cellulose avicel ph  <dig>   <dig>  % polyvinylpyrrolidone kollidon k <dig>   <dig>  % yeast,  <dig>  % crospovidone kollidon cl,  <dig>  % yeast,  <dig>  % vanilla,  <dig>  % colloidal silicon dioxide ,  <dig>  % magnesium stearate, makes a total weight of  <dig>  mg per tablet.fig.  <dig>  sampling schedule , including baseline and the treatment timescale.  a previously validated collection system was used for urine collection on day  <dig> to day  <dig> and day  <dig> to day  <dig>  <cit> . the system recorded accurately the time urination occurred. oral furosemide  was administered twice-daily from the morning of day  <dig> to the morning of day  <dig>  the treatment consisted of administering furosemide with one of four oral nsaid/placebo dosing regimens  from the morning of day  <dig> to the morning of day 8



furosemide, nsaids or placebo tablets were inserted in a small cube of moist cat food to facilitate oral administration. the rest of meal was withheld until at least 90 min after drug administration. treatment order was randomised, following a latin square design.

further urine collection commenced after the first furosemide treatment and lasted for 48 h during days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  blood was collected on the morning of day  <dig>  in the same animal ranking order as day  <dig>  a 10 day washout interval was allowed between the last administration of furosemide and collection of the baseline blood sample in the next period.

blood sampling, processing and assays
packed cell volume was measured before sample centrifugation  and storage of plasma aliquots at −80 °c until analysis. plasma renin activity  was measured by radioimmunoassay, as validated by syme et al.  <cit> . a radioimmunoassay validated in cats  <cit>  was used to measured plasma aldosterone concentration . creatinine , protein, sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium  concentrations were measured at a commercial laboratory.

urine sampling, processing and assays
urine was collected twice daily . urinary specific gravity as recorded for each sample. urine collected during the first day was stored at 4 °c for 24 h and pooled with urine from the second day. accurate urination times and volumes were recorded to calculate 24 h averaged urinary volumes and analyte excretions over the collection period  <cit> . the 24 h urine excretion was corrected by the average percentage of voided volume lost through retention in the litter tray  <cit>  and used alongside plasma and urinary creatinine concentrations to calculate gfr by endogenous urinary creatinine clearance. a non-selective cox inhibitor  solubilised in methanol was added to collected urine  to prevent ex vivo eicosanoid production. urine was centrifuged  and the supernatant stored at −80 °c. urinary electrolytes  were measured using ion sensitive electrodes and creatinine and protein concentrations were measured using jaffé and lowry methods, respectively . urinary aldosterone concentration was measured by ria after liquid extraction with dichloromethane. urinary prostanoids were co-extracted on reverse phase extraction columns  following a protocol adjusted from the manufacturer’s recommendation. urinary txb <dig> concentration was measured by ria  and urinary pge <dig> and 6-keto-pgf2α were measured by enzymatic immunoassay . urinary activity of γ-glutamyl transferase was measured on fresh samples within 24 h after the last collection using a colorimetric method . urinary nag was measured with a commercially available colorimetric assay , validated in the cat  <cit> . details of all assay protocols and validation results for blood and urine samples are presented in the additional file 2: s <dig> 

post-mortem study and specimen provenance
post-mortem kidney specimens were obtained  from  <dig> young  and  <dig> old  client-owned cats with normal renal function that had been euthanized or had died of natural non-renal causes. none of the cats had clinical signs indicative of chronic kidney disease , such as urinary specific gravity < <dig>  or plasma creatinine >177 μmol l− <dig> 

immunohistochemistry protocols
three micrometre thick paraffin sections were dewaxed and rehydrated in grading ethanol followed by heating slides in a microwave at medium-high power in citrate buffer ph  <dig>  for 15 min. endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treating the tissue section with 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. subsequently,  <dig>  % normal goat serum  or  <dig>  % normal donkey serum  was applied to block non-specific background staining of cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> primary antibodies, respectively. slides were incubated with cox- <dig>  or cox- <dig>  primary antibodies at 1: <dig> dilution at room temperature for 2 h and were then treated with biotinylated secondary antibody for cox- <dig>  or cox- <dig>  for 1 h. immunoactive complexes were detected by incubating the sections with avidin-biotin complex system  for 30 min and visualized with diaminobenzidine. the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. negative control slides were prepared by replacing the primary antibody with  <dig>  % normal serum. feline normal bladder sections were used as the cox- <dig> positive control  <cit> , while canine foetal kidney sections were selected as the cox- <dig> positive control  <cit> . stained sections were evaluated microscopically in a blinded manner and standard morphological criteria were used to identify the kidney structures. for each renal structure, staining intensity was assessed from  <dig> to  <dig>  in each cat,  <dig> md,  <dig> tubules and  <dig> glomeruli were randomly assessed and the median  intensity score was calculated as previously described  <cit> .

statistical analysis
sas software  was used for statistical analysis. when necessary, data were log transformed to satisfy the assumption of normal distribution of the residuals  and homoscedasticity. an anova model, containing sequence, period, sex, and baseline value as fixed effects and animal as a random effect, was fitted to all dependent variables. the effects of nsaid treatments were compared in a pairwise manner. the reported p-values are raw p-values corrected with a tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons. in addition, the difference from baseline  after furosemide for each nsaid treatment was tested against zero using a paired student’s t-test. results are presented as mean ± sd and p <  <dig>  was considered significant. for immunostaining studies, the kruskal-wallis test was used to compare the intensity scores between groups with significance level set at p <  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates the lack of effect of acute cox inhibition on furosemide-induced diuresis and natriuresis in cats. it is suggested both cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> are involved in the pra and aldosterone response to furosemide and that cox- <dig> may be involved in regulating pathways other than angiotensin ii stimulated aldosterone secretion. these findings, supported by the immunohistochemical localisation of cox- <dig> in the md of the feline kidney, illustrate that renal physiology is species-dependent.
