BACKGROUND
chickpea  is one of the world's more important but less studied leguminous food crop with over  <dig> m ha grown across the americas, the mediterranean basin, east africa, the middle east, asia and australia  <cit> . as a grain legume it plays a significant role in the nutrition of the rural and urban poor in the developing world, as it provides a protein-rich supplement to cereal-based diets particularly of vegetarians and subsistence farmers who cannot afford meat. despite its economic importance, chickpea productivity has been low because of yield losses to foliar and soil-borne fungal diseases , insect pests  and abiotic stresses such as drought, cold and salinity. sources of resistance and tolerance to these constraints exist in the wild cicer germplasm yet remain largely unused by conventional breeding programs  <cit> . three annual cicer gene-pools have been defined based on the available hybridization reports, biochemical and molecular diversity analysis  <cit> : species within the primary gene-pool  can be readily crossed usually generating fully fertile progeny; while species within the secondary gene-pool  can be successfully crossed with the cultigen c. arietinum, providing hybrid embryos are rescued. however, the progeny of crosses between primary and second gene-pools are frequently sterile; finally, species within the tertiary gene-pool  have not yet been successfully crossed with the cultigen cicer arietinum.

cultivated chickpea has a relatively low level of diversity, due to a series of bottlenecks caused by restricted distribution of the wild progenitors and the founder effect associated with domestication  <cit> . in addition, chickpea breeding programs have limited themselves to a small number of cultivated genotypes having sources of biotic stress resistance and abiotic stress tolerance with little or no use of wild species  <cit> . this has resulted in limited durability of resistances to many of the major pests and diseases, and limited progress in abiotic stress tolerance breeding. wild germplasm accessions held at the international centre for agricultural research in dry areas  in syria, the international institute for the semi-arid tropics  in india and other genebanks in usa, europe and australia contain valuable sources of novel genetic variation for improvement of these traits  <cit> . the wild cicer species from the secondary gene-pool  are known to possess multiple sources of pest and disease resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses including drought and cold  <cit> .

where species barriers can be overcome, molecular markers will facilitate rapid and efficient transfer of economically important traits into cultivated breeding pools. this will have the added advantage of broadening the narrow genetic base of this crop and thereby reducing its vulnerability to evolving pest and disease pressures, while simultaneously providing stable increases in yield far beyond the current  <dig> % annual improvement  <cit> .

most types of molecular markers have been tested in chickpea including isozymes  <cit> , restriction fragment length polymorphism   <cit>  random amplified polymorphic dna markers   <cit>  amplified fragment length polymorphisms   <cit> , sequence characterized amplified regions   <cit> , inter-simple sequence repeat   <cit> , simple sequence repeat   <cit> , resistance gene analogs   <cit>  dna amplification fingerprinting   <cit> , and expressed sequence tags   <cit> . however, there is a low level of polymorphism detected in cultivated chickpea using isozyme/allozyme markers  <cit>  and rflp analysis  <cit> . in contrast, ssr markers have been shown to be highly polymorphic within the cultigen c. arietinum  <cit>  and have been routinely utilized for creating genetic linkage maps  <cit> . these ssr markers have also been used as reference points for integration of the different chickpea linkage groups derived from inter- and intra- specific crosses  <cit> . to date there are over  <dig> ssr markers developed from chickpea genomic libraries  <cit> . in general, 30–50% of the chickpea ssr markers are polymorphic in any given breeding or intra-specific mapping population .

ssr markers remain the marker of choice for marker assisted selection in many breeding programs. however, ssr motifs may evolve too rapidly to be valuable as the sole assay for interspecific diversity analysis. in addition, markers shown to have tight genetic linkage to target genes in interspecific mapping populations may lose their selective power when used in backcross programs based on interspecific derivatives. thus, there is a need for the development and utilization of gene-based markers that better serve molecular breeding applications and diversity analysis of germplasm.

in this context, the most important criteria for new markers are high reproducibility, detection of co-dominance polymorphism and suitability for rapid large-scale low cost screening. est-based markers fulfill these criteria and since they are associated with the coding regions of the genome they also enhance molecular germplasm evaluation by capturing variation across transcribed regions and in genes of known function. this potentially resolves the problem of limited genomic coverage suffered by traditional single gene phylogenetic studies  <cit> . targeted est development has already begun in chickpea, focusing on aba-related mechanisms of water-deficit tolerance in epicotyl tissue  <cit> .

our objective in this study was to increase the public est resource for chickpea with a particular focus on root tissue, as constitutive drought tolerance mechanisms  are a common target for the crop physiology community  <cit>  and are increasingly identified by genomics studies as important components of stress tolerance mechanisms  <cit> . thus, an est library was constructed after ssh of root tissue from two very closely related chickpea  genotypes the landrace icc  <dig> and the popular local variety annigeri, both considered to possess important sources of drought tolerance  <cit> . following sequencing and functional annotation, we have generated over  <dig> est markers which we have used in preliminary diversity analysis of wild and cultivated cicer germplasm.

RESULTS
the ssh process resulted in over  <dig> clones expected to be largely associated with icc  <dig>  but could conceivably also include some highly constitutively expressed genes from annigeri . typically the cdna inserts ranged from  <dig> – <dig> kb. all clones were partially or fully sequenced through a single pass read from the 3' end and trimmed of vector and low quality sequences. a length threshold of  <dig> bp was set in view of the minimum expected size of a functional gene-encoding region   <cit> . removal of short sequences  resulted in  <dig> high quality est sequences with an average length of  <dig> bp all available at the icrisat chickpea est database  <cit> .

analysis of ests and assembly of consensus sequences
gene annotations were based on similarities to either known or putative ests in the public databases. all annotations were based on blast searches, with a score threshold of ≥  <dig> for blastn. for tblastx a score threshold of > <dig> was set, as these generally had e-values <10- <dig> with a minimum of 50% identity over at least 30% of the length of the protein, which are the commonly used thresholds for reliable sequence annotation  <cit> . tentative functional annotations of est sequences based on tblastx were grouped under  <dig> general categories based on the biochemical functions of the predicted proteins . the  <dig> sequences were assembled into  <dig> contigs with  <dig> ests remaining unassociated . putative identifications could be assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences , representing 73% of the unigenes , and all of these proteins were represented in other plant species. the  <dig> sequences were assembled into  <dig> contigs with  <dig> ests remaining unassociated . assuming that in most cases each contig represents one gene  <cit>  a maximum number of  <dig> genes are represented in this dataset . the total length of contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bases  while the largest number of ests assembled into one contig was  <dig>  est assembly leading to the generation of tentative consensus  sequences has dramatically reduced the redundancy in this database, as reported elsewhere  <cit>  .

over three quarters of the  <dig> consensus sequences  were found to have significant similarity  to sequences in public databases. many of these annotations  were validated through comparison with the cdd database using rps-blast which compares a protein query sequence to a position-specific score matrix prepared from the underlying conserved protein domain alignment  <cit> . conserved motifs consistent with tblastx annotations were identified in  <dig> consensus sequences providing an additional level of confidence for these assigned gene functions .

as expected, we observed a substantial number of the est contigs and singletons to have no significant homology  to either nucleotide or protein sequences in public databases at the time of analysis. this compares well to the higher proportion of sequences  reported with little or no homology from chickpea leaf tissue  <cit> . in addition, a substantial number of ests  were found to have similarity with unannotated hypothetical, putative or unknown proteins contained in the public databases and were, therefore, placed in the unidentified function  class.

pcr optimisation and unit costs
optimization of pcr conditions is a critical precursor for accurate and robust large-scale marker screening and offers additional benefits for reducing the unit cost of genotyping  <cit> . as optimization relies on the sequential investigation of each reaction variable, the process can take a long time, thus the conditions of optimization are rarely identified empirically and individual components are rarely all tested simultaneously. however, cobb and clarkson  <cit>  devised a strategy in which the components of a pcr reaction could be tested together using the least number ofexperiments based on the taguchi principle  <cit> . we adapted the cobb and clarkson  <cit> ,  <dig> reactions of  <dig> pcr components to a  <dig> reactions of  <dig> pcr components, the additional component being enzyme concentration. this further reduced the time and cost of optimization, whilst also minimizing the cost of the pcr screening by also considering enzyme concentration. final primer  and taq dna polymerase  concentrations resulted in a reagent unit cost of us$ <dig>  per pcr sample. this compares very favorable with other reports of pcr unit costs  <cit> . clearly dna extraction costs are an equally important component for molecular breeding programs and can also be greatly reduced as has been reported elsewhere  <cit> . the primer sequences and optimization parameters of all the polymorphic markers are given in table  <dig>  optimization also resulted in fewer spurious amplification products and clearer polymorphic bands amongst the accessions studied .

est marker diversity analysis
a total of  <dig> est primers were designed, optimized and screened, of which  <dig> gave good amplification products in icc  <dig>  while  <dig> were deemed unsuitable as they either did not produce an amplification product or generated a complex pattern of bands which were difficult to evaluate. of the  <dig> primers pairs screened across  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> wild cicer species,  <dig> were polymorphic . a total of  <dig> polymorphic fragments ranging in size from  <dig> to > <dig> bp was scored on polyacrylamide or agarose electrophoresis gels depending on product size . the number of alleles detected per primer ranged from  <dig> –  <dig> with the polymorphic information content  ranging  <dig>  –  <dig>  .

fourteen of the  <dig> est's contained ssr motifs, of which  <dig> contained perfect trinucleotide repeats. a relatively large proportion of these est-ssr markers  were derived from the no significant homology  and unknown protein functional  classes, based on sequence comparisons . markers from these est classes have readily detected polymorphism in the diverse germplasm tested . since over 48% of the est's generated from the chickpea root library fall into nsh and uf classes, these are clearly useful markers with potentially important, yet unknown functions.

eleven of the polymorphic est's were from stress annotated transcripts ; of these four contained ssr motifs . these stress related est markers may be useful for allele-mining of germplasm collections for the identification of candidate accessions with new sources of agronomically important traits and for candidate gene mapping  <cit> .

the est data-set generated in this study was used to compute pair-wise genetic distances between species according to band similarity coefficient and upgma clustering. in order to display, with minimal distortion, the genetic relationships between species, a principle coordinate analysis  was carried out. the first two dimensions of the pcoa plot indicate the presence of  <dig> clusters, which account for 20% and 17% of the total variation . dollo and polymorphism parsimony analysis  conducted on this data-set found one most parsimonious tree with  <dig> steps  corresponding well with the pcoa analysis.

both pcoa and parsimony analysis provide clear separation of most species. both analysis grouped c. echinospermum, c. reticulatum and c. arietinum, together. these three species are classified together as the primary gene pool based on crossability studies. similarly, all previous diversity studies based on allozymes  <cit> , rapd  <cit> , microsatellite  <cit> , issr  <cit>  and aflp  <cit>  markers have also grouped c. echinospermum, c. reticulatum and c. arietinum together. the est-based diversity analysis presented here shows c. arietinum  to be slightly distant to c. echinospermum and c. reticulatum but still within the same cluster . all previous molecular diversity studies have clustered c. bijugum, c. pinnatifidum and c. judaicum together, although sometimes not well differentiated from the primary gene-pool species based on molecular diversity analysis. these three species are commonly considered to represent the secondary gene-pool as they require embryo rescue to recover viable progeny when crossed with the cultigen  <cit> . both parsimony and pcoa analyses of the est data-set clustered c. judaicum, c. pinnatifidum and c. bijugum together. this is in agreement with previous studies which demonstrated the close association of these three species. the current analysis suggests that c. pinnatifidum and c. judaicum are more closely related. this is in agreement with previous reports based on morphology analysis  <cit> , seed storage protein analysis  <cit>  and isozyme analysis  <cit> . in contrast, ecogeographical studies of the wild cicer germplasm have suggested that c. judaicum to be quite diverged  <cit> , which may explain the outlying position of one c. judaicum accession studied here  . most other species generally fall into one of two clusters generally collectively referred to as the tertiary gene pool  from which no viable hybrids have been reported from crosses with the cultigen.

parsimony analysis grouped c. chorassanicum with c. cuneatum, but placed the c. yamashitae accessions as outliers . this data supports the tertiary group proposed by croser et al.  <cit>  to consist of; c. chorassanicum which has never been successfully crossed with cultivated chickpea and c. yamashitae and c. cuneatum which have been crossed with the cultigen but the resultant progeny have failed to flower or proven sterile. however, this is not reflected in the pcoa .

the distribution of accessions from the same species within secondary and tertiary clusters suggests that these two gene-pools may not be as distinct as previously expected. this may indicate that there are some tertiary gene-pool species that might be more readily crossed with the cultigen than their taxonomic classification would otherwise indicate. however, since the current study is based on a limited numbers of accessions for both c. cuneatum and c. yamashitae further research is required to fully define the relationships between these species and the scope of new opportunities for plant breeders.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of the use of est-based markers for estimating genetic distances between annual cicer species. we report on the development and characterization of  <dig> est markers from chickpea sequences with functional annotations or unknown functions, some of which contain ssr motifs. these markers have detected high levels of polymorphism amongst the wild species studied here and initial results indicate that around 20% are polymorphic in intraspecific  mapping populations, either directly or as cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences  based markers  <cit> .

the est marker-based diversity analysis reported here broadly supports the cicer taxonomy based on allozymic data and conclusions by croser et al.  <cit> . the concurrence of our est data with that of allozymic studies in particular suggests that many gene-based loci do have a common ancestory across cicer species, as proposed but not substantiated by choumane et al.  <cit> . clustering patterns based on rapd, aflp and issr are generally very similar  <cit>  but are substantially different to those based on the est marker analysis reported here and the previously reported allozyme-based analyses  <cit> . this may be a consequence of rapd, aflp and issr markers sampling fundamentally different regions of the genome  as compared with markers based on expressed genes. unfortunately a detailed comparison of different assays is confounded by the virtual absence of common accessions and the adoption of different statistical analyses in each study  <cit> .

the est database developed in this study provides a preliminary profile of some differentially expressed genes that may be associated with constitutive mechanisms important for stress tolerance and root development in chickpea roots. these include transcripts with putative annotations for proteases, t6p synthase, non-specific lipid transfer proteins, mrp-like abc transporters, chaperones- hsp <dig>  tcp-1-alpha, bzip transcription factor, calcium atpases, protein kinases, mrp <dig> glutathione-conjugate transporter, glutathione s-transferase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, s-adenosyl methionine synthetase . it is envisaged that these differentially expressed genes can be validated by the chickpea community and the most promising ests used in candidate gene mapping and allele mining. the resultant annotated est markers will then be of substantial value for marker-assisted introgression programs based on interspecific crosses using wild cicer species that harbour agronomically valuable genes. one of the aims of chickpea breeding is to address the continuing need for cultivars adapted to particular geographical regions or with specific new ideotypes to ensure sustainability and profitability of production. an important means of continuing to achieve such breeding objectives is through the use of novel germplasm  <cit> . many breeding programs, in particular those involving rice and wheat, have successfully utilized molecular and statistical approaches in accelerating the introduction of novel genes from wild species through marker accelerated backcross breeding.

the availability of increasing amounts of sequence data in many legume species now offers the potential for routine development of gene-based markers. these provide the ultimate assay  for indirect trait selection and map-based cloning. combining gene-based markers together with highly polymorphic flanking ssr markers will greatly assist in reducing linkage drag and increasing the speed and efficiency of subsequent introgression programs. finally, molecular genetic diversity analysis based on est markers may also provide a means of predicting which accessions are most likely to produce fertile progeny when crossed with chickpea cultivars.
