BACKGROUND
chloroplasts are dynamic organelles of prokaryotic origin within the plant cell that house the photosynthetic apparatus. in addition to photosynthesis, other important metabolic activities take place within chloroplasts including the production of starch, certain amino acids and lipids, some of the colorful pigments in flowers, vitamins and several key aspects of sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. chloroplasts possess their own genome and a full complement of transcriptional and translation machinery to express their genetic information. in particular, chloroplast gene expression machinery is a distinctive assembly of prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and phage-like components–likely the result of acquisition of a great number of regulatory proteins during evolution. the presence of nucleic acids within chloroplasts was established in  <dig>  <cit> . this subsequently led to the selection of cpdna as one of the first candidates for complete genome sequencing  <cit> . studies of the organization and evolution of chloroplast genomes have been rapidly expanding due to the availability of the number of completely sequenced genomes published in the past decade. fifty-four completed genomes are available from various land plant lineages, with the best representation  from flowering plants. comparative studies indicate that chloroplast genomes of land plants are highly conserved in both gene order and gene content  <cit> . moreover, the substitution rate in cpdna is much lower than in nuclear dna and significantly reduced in the inverted repeat regions as compared to the single copy regions  <cit> .

chloroplast bioengineering offers a number of advantages over nuclear transformation including high levels of transgene expression and gene containment  <cit> . in addition, chloroplast genetic engineering has also become a powerful tool for basic research in biogenesis and function of this organelle. this approach has helped unveil a wealth of information about cpdna replication origins, introns, maturases, translation elements, proteolysis, import of proteins and several other processes  <cit> . however, this technology is readily feasible only in tobacco. lack of complete chloroplast genome sequence is still one of the major limitations preventing the expansion of chloroplast bioengineering to other useful crops. transgene integration into the chloroplast genome occurs exclusively by homologous recombination of chloroplast dna flanking sequences. therefore, chloroplast genome sequence analysis is crucial for identification of spacer regions to integrate transgenes at optimal positions as well as the identification of endogenous regulatory sequences that support optimal expression of transgenes  <cit> . prior to  <dig> only seven published crop chloroplast genomes were available and this number has increased to  <dig> during the past two years  <cit> . furthermore, the availability of genome sequence information has also made it possible to study evolutionary relationships among chloroplast and nuclear genomes  <cit> .

citrus is the largest fruit crop of international economic value because of its many uses including its value as a nutritive food source and for its valuable essential oils utilized by the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. the valuable citrus industry in florida  has recently been put in peril because of the accidental introduction of the exotic disease citrus canker. this bacterial disease, which can infect all cultivars of citrus, is the result of infection by xanthomonas pv citri  <cit> . elimination of this disease by eradication has resulted in a cost of $ <dig>  billion  and the destruction of  <dig> million commercial and  <dig> million nursery and residential trees . attempts at resistance breeding in citrus are impeded by many biological characteristics, such as juvenility, incompatibility, heterozygosity, a narrow genetic basis, and nucellar embryony. in this context, genetic engineering of the chloroplast genome with non-host resistance traits would be an effective alternative for transferring desirable traits because of its many advantages over nuclear transformation  <cit> . however, for citrus, genetic improvement through chloroplast transformation has been limited due to the lack of available chloroplast genome sequence, not only in the genus citrus but also in the entire family rutaceae.

in this article, we report on the complete sequence of the chloroplast genome of citrus sinensis  osbeck var. 'ridge pineapple', which is the first published whole genome sequence of a member of the family rutaceae and order sapindales. we describe the organization of this genome and we present a phylogenetic analysis of citrus and  <dig> other angiosperm chloroplast genomes based on  <dig> shared protein-coding genes. the phylogenetic comparisons enable an examination of relationships among several major clades of angiosperms.

RESULTS
size, gene content, order and organization of the citrus chloroplast genome
the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome of citrus sinensis  osbeck var 'ridge pineapple' has been determined . this genome is  <dig>  bp in length and includes a pair of inverted repeats  of  <dig>  bp separated by small and large single copy  regions of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. a total of  <dig> genes was detected,  <dig> are single copy, while  <dig> are duplicated in inverted repeat regions. eighty-nine genes code for proteins, including nine genes duplicated in the inverted repeat. there are four rrna genes and  <dig> distinct trnas,  <dig> of which are duplicated in the inverted repeat. seventeen genes have introns,  <dig> of which contain a single intron while three  have two introns. the genome consists of  <dig> % protein-coding,  <dig> % non-coding,  <dig> % trna and  <dig> % rrna genes. the gc and at content in the citrus chloroplast genome is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the overall at content is similar to tobacco , rice  and maize . the at content of the lsc and ssc regions are  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, whereas that of the ir-regions is  <dig> % due to the presence of an rrna gene cluster. infa, a gene coding for a translation initiation factor in other plant species, is absent in the citrus genome. the inverted repeat region has expanded to duplicate rps <dig> and the first  <dig> amino acids of rpl <dig>  the rpl <dig> gene in the irb region has a nonsense mutation resulting in  <dig> stop codons. both the ir expansion and the presence of internal stop codons in rpl <dig> were confirmed by pcr amplification and sequencing using primers that flank the ir/lsc boundaries.

repeat analysis
repeat analysis identified  <dig> direct and inverted repeats  <dig> bp or longer with a sequence identity ≥ 90% . the longest repeat, other than the ir is  <dig> bp in length. most of the repeated sequences are located in the intergenic regions while some are in protein-coding regions .

variation between coding sequences and cdnas
dna and est sequences were compared by aligning the ~ <dig>  publicly available citrus sinensis expressed sequence tag  sequences with the genes extracted from completed citrus chloroplast genome sequence. five non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions were identified in the protein-coding transcripts of petl, psbh, ycf <dig> and ndha . in ycf <dig> two amino acid substitutions were found, which resulted in a change from hydrophobic non-polar to hydrophilic acidic and hydrophilic polar amino acids, respectively. the substitution in the ndha protein resulted in a change from a hydrophilic polar to a hydrophobic non-polar. in contrast, only one synonymous substitution was detected in transcripts coding for rps <dig>  in non-protein-coding regions, seven additional differences were detected, including one in the intron of ycf <dig> and five in the ribosomal rna gene rrn <dig> . the differences could be due to mrna editing, sequencing error, or polymorphisms between the tissues used for genome versus est sequencing.

phylogenetic analysis
the data matrix for phylogenetic analyses included  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> taxa, including  <dig> angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups . the data set comprised  <dig>  aligned nucleotide positions but when the gaps were excluded there were  <dig>  characters. maximum parsimony  analyses resulted in a single, fully resolved tree with a length of  <dig> , a consistency index of  <dig>   and a retention index of  <dig>  . bootstrap analyses indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes were supported by values ≥ 95%. maximum likelihood  analysis resulted in a single tree with a ml value of – lnl =  <dig>  . the ml and mp trees differed in the relationships among three groups . first, the mp tree placed amborella alone as the earliest diverging angiosperm lineage and this position was strongly supported with a 100% bootstrap value. in contrast, the ml tree provided weak support  for a sister relationship between amborella and the nymphaeales at the base of angiosperms. second, in the mp tree calycanthus, the only representative of magnoliids, was positioned sister to eudicots with moderate bootstrap support of 73%. in the ml tree, calycanthus was weakly supported  as sister to a clade that includes both monocots and eudicots. third, the monophyly of the eurosid i clade was strongly supported in the mp tree , whereas the ml tree does not support eurosid i monophyly. both mp and ml analyses provided strong support for the monophyly of eurosid ii and for the placement of citrus  sister to a clade that includes gossypium  and arabidopsis .

discussion
implications for integration of transgenes
chloroplast genetic engineering offers several advantages, including a high-level of transgene expression  <cit> , multi-gene engineering in a single transformation event  <cit> , transgene containment via maternal inheritance  <cit>  or cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> , lack of gene silencing  <cit> , position effect due to site specific transgene integration  <cit> , and lack of pleiotropic effects due to sub-cellular compartmentalization of transgene products  <cit> . apart from expressing therapeutic agents  <cit> , biopolymers  <cit>  or transgenes to confer valuable agronomic traits, including herbicide resistance  <cit> , disease resistance  <cit> , insect resistance  <cit> , drought tolerance  <cit> , salt tolerance  <cit> , and phytoremediation  <cit> , chloroplast genetic engineering has been used to study chloroplast biogenesis and function, revealing the mechanisms of dna replication origins, intron maturases, translation elements and proteolysis, import of proteins, and several other processes  <cit> . despite the potential of chloroplast genetic engineering, this technology has only recently been extended to the major crops, including soybean  <cit> , carrot  <cit> , lettuce  <cit> , and cotton  <cit> .

the availability of complete sequences of chloroplast genomes enhances their use for genetic engineering. in chloroplast transformation, finding appropriate intergenic spacer regions is very important for efficient integration of transgenes. in tomato and potato, researchers have used trnfm-trng, rbcl-accd, trnv-3'-rps <dig>  and 16s rrna-orf 70b intergenic spacer regions of tobacco to integrate transgenes  <cit> . unfortunately, none of these regions have 100% sequence identity  <cit> . for example, the intergenic spacer region between rbcl and accd of potato and tobacco shows only 94% sequence identity. subsequently, potato chloroplast transformants are generated at 10– <dig> times lower frequencies than tobacco  <cit> . similarly, the trnfm and trng intergenic spacer region used for tomato chloroplast transformation has only 82% sequence identity with tobacco, resulting in inefficient transgene integration. there are major deletions in the tomato chloroplast genome in this intergenic spacer region when compared to tobacco, which was used for transformation  <cit> . therefore, the development of species-specific vectors for transgene integration would enable the use of any of the intergenic spacer regions within the respective chloroplast genomes  <cit> . moreover, genome organization is different among some species. for instance the rbcl and accd genes are adjacent in tobacco and most other angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including citrus. however, they are not adjacent in the soybean chloroplast genome because an inversion has altered gene order  <cit> . these examples emphasize the importance of choosing appropriate intergenic spacer regions for chloroplast transformation.

genome organization
gene order of the citrus genome is identical to the published genome sequences of the solanaceae  <cit> , which have the inferred ancestral angiosperm genome organization  <cit> . the rps <dig> gene and the first  <dig> amino acids of rpl <dig>  which generally are single copy in the lsc on the irb side, have been duplicated in citrus. thus, there is a complete, second copy of rps <dig> and a truncated copy of rpl <dig> adjacent to trnh. this duplication is likely due to an expansion of irb at the lsc junction, a common process in chloroplast genomes  <cit> . the gene content of citrus is also very similar to most other angiosperm chloroplast genomes. however, infa, a gene coding for a translation initiation factor in other plant species, is absent in the citrus genome, and rpl <dig> is apparently not functional due to a frame shift mutation. millen et al.  <cit>  demonstrated at least  <dig> independent losses of infa in angiosperms, and in four lineages this gene has been shown to be transferred to the nucleus. three of these losses are evident in our phylogeny based on cpdna sequences . among the rosid genomes sequenced the infa loss has occurred only once and this change supports the basal split between vitis and the rest of the rosids . the rpl <dig> gene in the irb region has a nonsense mutation resulting in  <dig> stop codons indicating that this gene is not functional. this was confirmed by pcr amplification and sequencing using primers that flank the ir/lsc boundaries. the rpl <dig> gene has been reported to be missing in legume chloroplast genomes and the import of nuclear encoded protein has been demonstrated  <cit> . our group recently reported that rpl <dig> was also missing in the cotton chloroplast genome  <cit>  but it turns out that this was an annotation error. the lack of a functional copy of rpl <dig> in citrus should be investigated further, including an expanded sampling of members of the rutaceae and sapindales.

repeat analysis identified  <dig> direct and inverted repeats  <dig> bp or longer with a sequence identity ≥ 90% in the citrus chloroplast genome with the longest repeat, other than the ir,  <dig> bp in length . the presence of dispersed repeats in chloroplast genomes, especially in intergenic spacer regions, has been reported in a number of angiosperm lineages, including other rosids  <cit> .

phylogenetic implications
phylogenies based on  <dig> protein-coding genes  generally agree with several recent studies based on multiple genes or complete chloroplast genomes  <cit> . areas of congruence that are strongly supported include the monophyly of monocots and their sister relationship to eudicots, monophyly of rosids and asterids, and the sister relationship between caryophyllales  and asterids.

our chloroplast genome trees  indicate that the earliest diverging angiosperm lineage is either amborella or amborella + nymphaeales. this incongruence between mp and ml trees was noted previously  <cit> . this same incongruence was observed in a multigene phylogeny that includes nine genes from the chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear genomes  <cit> . in this case, phylogenies for chloroplast genes supported the amborella basal hypothesis, whereas mitochondrial genes supported amborella + nymphaeales as the earliest angiosperm lineage.

a second incongruence between mp and ml trees concerns the position of the magnoliid calycanthus, although bootstrap support for the different relationships is weak . the mp tree places calycanthus sister to eudicots, whereas the ml tree positions this taxon sister to a clade that includes both monocots and eudicots. this same incongruence was observed in previous phylogenetic analyses based on the  <dig> protein-coding chloroplast genes  <cit> . the position of magnoliids continues to be controversial. several molecular phylogenies have suggested different sets of relationships among magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots. phylogenies based on phytochrome  <cit>  and  <dig> chloroplast  <cit>  genes placed magnoliids sister to monocots + eudicots but bootstrap support was weak. several studies supported monocots as the sister group of magnoliids + eudicots  <cit>  but bootstrap support was again weak. both matk  <cit>  and three gene  <cit>  phylogenies suggested that eudicots are sister to magnoliids + monocots. finally, the nine-gene phylogeny of qiu et al.  <cit>  recovered all three of these sets of relationships depending on the phylogenetic methods  and the genes used but support was very weak in each case. the different resolutions of relationships of magnoliids are greatly affected by taxon sampling and phylogenetic methodology. the affects of both of these phenomena have been discussed in several recent papers on the utility of whole chloroplast genomes for phylogenetic reconstruction of angiosperms  <cit> . clearly, additional complete chloroplast genome sequences are needed to resolve the relationships among magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots.

a third incongruence between the mp and ml trees concerns the monophyly of the eurosid i clade . the mp tree  strongly supports the monophyly of eurosid i , whereas in the ml tree the eurosid i clade in not monophyletic because cucumis is strongly sister to the myrtales instead of the fabales. this same incongruence was detected in jansen et al.  <cit>  and was attributed to limited taxon sampling and model misspecification in ml analyses, two phenomena that are known to have adverse effects on phylogenetic reconstruction  <cit> . expanded taxon sampling of rosids is needed to critically evaluate the monophyly of the eurosid i clade, especially since there is only moderate support for monophyly of eurosid i in previous phylogenies based on a single or few genes .

both mp and ml trees are congruent with regard to the phylogenetic placement of citrus. the genus is positioned as a member of the eurosid ii clade, which has very strong bootstrap support in both mp  and ml  trees . the eurosid ii clade, which currently includes the four groups brassicales, malvales, sapindales, and tapisciaceae, has received strong support in previous dna sequence phylogenies based on one to three genes  <cit> , although relationships among these groups remain unresolved. previous phylogenies based on whole chloroplast genomes  <cit>  have included only one or two groups . the addition of citrus from the sapindales expands the sampling to three of four currently recognized groups of eurosids ii. both mp and ml trees  provide strong support  for a sister relationship between the brassicales and malvales. this same relationship was weakly supported based on phylogenies using one or two chloroplast genes  <cit> . in contrast, the three gene phylogeny of soltis et al.  <cit>  weakly supported a sister relationship between the malvales and sapindales. although taxon sampling is still somewhat limited, our 61-gene phylogeny provides very strong support for a close relationship between the brassicales and malvales. expanded taxon sampling of the eurosid ii clade is needed to confirm these results.

CONCLUSIONS
complete chloroplast genome sequences provide valuable information on spacer regions for integration of transgenes at optimal sites via homologous recombination, as well as endogenous regulatory sequences for optimal expression of transgenes and should help in extending this technology to other useful crops. availability of complete chloroplast genome sequence should pave the way for genetic manipulation of citrus and other members of the rutaceae. furthermore, the addition of the citrus genome sequence to phylogenetic analyses provides strong support for the monophyly of the eurosid ii clade, and the sister group relationship between the sapindales and the brassicales/malvales clade.
