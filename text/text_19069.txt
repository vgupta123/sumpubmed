BACKGROUND
tropane alkaloids  including anisodamine, anisodine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine are widely used as anticholinergic agents, which act on the parasympathetic nervous system and exclusively exist in solanaceous plants such as anisodus, atropa, datura, duboisia, hyoscyamus, and scopolia  <cit> . specially, anisodamine is not as toxic as atropine and has fewer negative effects on the central nervous system than scopolamine  <cit> . furthermore, anisodamine and anisodine also showed protective effects on acute lung injury induced by oleic acid and microvascular injury of acute renal failure in rats  <cit> .

the hairy root culture system offered many advantages such as high genetic stability, rapid and hormone-free growth, which was considered as a promising way to produce bioactive components from the medicinal plants  <cit> . it has been proven that the application of small scale jar fermenters for culturing hairy roots induced from several solanaceous plants is a very prospective method for production of ta  <cit> . now ta biosynthetic pathway and key enzyme gene identification have been made clear, so it is possible to enhance ta production in the hairy root culture by biotechnology methods  <cit> .

a. acutangulus is a chinese native medicinal plant with higher content of total alkaloids and it has been considered as an attractive plant resource for ta yield  <cit> . but the natural amounts of anisodamine, anisodine and scopolamine are not very high in a. acutangulus. however, these alkaloids are all important in phyto-medicine with rapid increasing market demand. thus, it is essential to improve their yields by biotechnological approaches.  <cit> .

in ta biosynthetic pathway, putrescine n-methyltransferase  was considered as the first rate-limiting upstream enzyme while tropinone reductase i  was an important branch-controlling enzyme . hence, these two genes are promising target sites for genetic engineering to increase ta in a. acutangulus hairy root cultures. recently, the cdnas of putrescine n-methyltransferase  and tropinone reductase i  of a. acutangulus have been successfully cloned by our laboratory  <cit> . however, there is no report on simultaneous introduction of pmt and tri into any ta-producing plant including a. acutangulus. in this paper, aapmt and aatri genes were simultaneously introduced into a. acutangulus hairy roots for the first time.

RESULTS
identification of transformed root lines through pcr analysis
three plasmids containing the cdnas encoding aapmt and/or aatri, driven by camv 35s promoter, were separately introduced into a. acutangulus using disarmed a. tumefaciens c58c <dig> strain. in total,  <dig> aapmt single gene transformed lines ,  <dig> aatri single gene transformed lines  and  <dig> aapmt and aatri double gene transformed lines  were generated, respectively . the hairy root lines were subcultured for about  <dig> weeks in hormone-free, b <dig> solid medium with cefotaxime. at last,  <dig> p,  <dig> t and  <dig> pt hygromycin-resistant hairy root lines were obtained . dna of all the independent hairy roots was isolated and used for pcr analysis using primers specially designed to overlap part of the aapmt or aatri and the camv 35s promoter sequences. the plasmid 1304+-aapmt or 1304+-aatri was used as positive control  and control hairy-root lines generated from blank-vector transformations were used as bc. in total, the pcr-positive clones amounted to  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for p, t and pt lines, respectively. none of the checked dna bands was detected from bc lines .

morphological characterization of the transgenic hairy roots
in this experiment, the transgenic hairy roots had two main morphology forms. one form was abnormal and looked brownish, thick with short branches such as pt <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  this kind of hairy root has been abnormal with slow growth since it was cultured on solid medium during the stage of sterilization . contrarily, most of transgenic hairy roots belonged to another form, which were normal and looked yellowish or light brownish with whiter slender branched. these hairy root clones have been always normal from the stage of sterilization in the culture dishes to the stage of rapid growth in the flasks .

analysis of the transcript level of aapmt and aatri
total rna was isolated from the positive root lines and rt-pcr, real-time fluorescence quantitative analysis were used to determine the expression levels of aapmt and aatri. as shown in figure 2b and 2c, the different expression levels illustrated that total aapmt gene  and total aatri gene  transcripts in transgenic pt, p lines and t lines exhibited higher expression than the native aapmt gene  and native aatri gene  transcripts. moreover, the expression patterns of aapmt e and aatri e in the above transgenic lines showed similar levels with aapmt t and aatri t in bc lines. on the contrary, the aapmt t and aatri t transcripts in the p, t and pt lines had higher transcript levels, which demonstrated that all the expression cassettes of the cdnas encoding aapmt and/or aatri were introduced into a. acutangulus and expressed at varying degrees in corresponding transgenic lines.

two independent transgenic lines with aapmt and aatri genes, two lines with aapmt gene and two lines with aatri gene were chosen . the average expression levels of aapmt and aatri gene in pt <dig> and pt <dig> were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher when compared with control, respectively. in p <dig> and p <dig>  the mean expression level of aapmt gene was  <dig> -fold higher as compared to control. in t <dig> and t <dig>  the expression levels of aatri gene on average were  <dig> -fold higher when compared with non-transgenic clones.

ta profile in transgenic hairy roots
the contents of ta in a. acutangulus hairy root lines were analyzed by hplc. three independent samples extracted from the transgenic lines and the control lines were tested with spss software. one sample t test was used to identify the accumulations of ta which showed significant changes in different lines and control. the capacities of transgenic root lines to yield ta were shown in figure  <dig>  p lines showed higher level of ta content than control , which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/g dw . t lines also produced larger level of ta  than the control . specially, the yield of ta in line t <dig> reached to  <dig>  mg/g dw . the average content of ta in pt lines was significantly enhanced, which was much higher than the average content of the control. the levels of ta in pt lines were within the range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/g dw. the highest yield of ta was detected as  <dig>  mg/g dw in line pt <dig>  which was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> -times higher than those of the control , p <dig>  and t <dig>  . the accumulations of scopolamine and anisodine were obviously improved in pt <dig> . the yields of scopolamine and anisodine in pt <dig> were 49-folds and 19- folds higher than the amounts in the bc line, respectively. moreover, the content of single alkaloid among all hairy root lines was in accordance with the content of ta . for example, the content of ta in line pt <dig> was significantly higher compared with that in the control lines . so the contents of four alkaloids in line pt <dig> were also much higher than control. the result above confirmed that biotechnological approach was a high-efficiency way to enhance the production of tropane alkaloids.

the average productions of anisodamine, hyoscyamine, anisodine, scopolamine and total ta among various transgenic hairy root lines 

the difference of average yields of ta in p, t, pt, and bc lines was showed in table  <dig>  it illustrated that the content of ta in pt lines  was the highest, when compared with t lines , p lines  and bc lines . the average content of hyoscyamine in pt lines  was much higher than that of bc lines , but there is no remarkable difference between t  and p lines . the average content of anisodine in pt lines  showed further higher than that of bc lines . the average content of anisodine was almost the same between t  and p lines . to scopolamine, its average content in pt lines was  <dig>  mg/g dw, which also showed much higher than the content in bc lines . it was improved by inconceivable  <dig>  times compared to the bc lines.

antioxidant activity analysis of transgenic hairy roots
the antioxidant activity of ta from hairy roots was estimated by measuring dpph radical scavenging in this study. as shown in figure  <dig>  all the tested samples were found to possess strong radical scavenging capacity, which were similar to control.

discussion
ta production in a. acutangulus hairy root cultures was indeed enhanced by biotechnology approach. however, in present study, considerable variation in morphology between different lines was observed, which was similar to the result reported by jouhikainen et al  <cit> . the change of external conditions such as the nuances of ingredient in different 1/ <dig> ms liquid nutrient media, the nuance of temperature in the gyratory shaker and the diversification of internal conditions may lead to the different root morphologies.  <cit> . however, in our experiment, the yields of ta in abnormal hairy roots were higher than those of normal ones. but they would be broken down when inoculated in liquid medium for some time and they were not routinely subcultured. the results implied that root morphology could lead to the content change of secondary metabolite production  <cit> .

the expression levels of the aapmt t varied from line to line but correlated with their corresponding content of ta in p lines. the average content of ta in p lines showed higher than that of bc lines. moreover, the contents of anisodamine, anisodine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine were all improved in contrast to those in bc lines, respectively. these results showed that aapmt gene in p lines has a positive influence on the flow of metabolites through ta biosynthesis pathway in a. acutangulus, which suggested that aapmt gene is a new promising target site for metabolic regulation of tropane-alkaloid pathway in a. acutangulus  <cit> . however, overexpression of pmt gene in a. belladonna and h. niger hairy root cultures have no significant promotion on accumulation of ta  <cit> , which may be due to species-related or different specific post-translational regulation of the native enzyme in respect to the foreign one  <cit> . sometimes, genetic manipulation of single enzymes to increase flux through the pathway may display various and even paradox results between different species  <cit> .

the yield of ta in t lines was higher than the control and even p lines, which accounted for that aatri gene is a more effective regulatory target than aapmt gene for improving metabolic flux in ta biosynthetic pathway. the average content of ta in t lines  were higher than that in p lines  or bc lines . so strong expression of aatri t in a. acutangulus hairy roots could up-regulate content of ta  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  two tropinone reductases  formed the branching point of tropane alkaloid biosynthesis. high expression of trii gene would lead to increasing accumulation of calystegines in the roots; while strong expression of tri gene was accompanied with increased level of ta and decreased level of calystegine  <cit> . in a word, high tri activity in t lines has positive effect on the conversion from pseudotropine to tropine, which would provide more key precursor for synthesis of ta.

overexpression of single gene encoding a key enzyme may increase flux through the pathway, but its effect may be limited by other rate-committee step to some degree. therefore, regulation of two or multiple genes would be more suitable to achieve significant gains in product accumulation. this may especially be true in branched pathways in which precursors can be channeled into a variety of metabolites away from the desired product  <cit> . in our work, line pt <dig> was the most successful one for production of ta, which was attributed to co-overexpression of two key genes . these results showed aapmt and aatri make cooperative effect than single gene in the accumulation of ta in pt lines. in the hairy root lines, overexpressing upstream key enzyme and downstream branch-controlling enzyme may act as a push-pull effect in which flux is pushed toward the branch point by aapmt and then pulled toward the desired product by aatri .

the dpph  radical scavenging activity, based on the reduction of the stable radical dpph to yellow-colored diphenylpicrylhydrazine in the presence of a hydrogen donor, was widely used to evaluate the antioxidant activity due to its advantage of rapid and simple measure  <cit> . ta has shown to possess the antioxidant activities  <cit> . the antioxidant activity of ta from hairy roots was estimated by measuring dpph radical scavenging in this study. all the tested samples were found to possess strong radical scavenging capacity, which suggested that there were no significant differences among them. it indicated that antioxidant activity of aliquots of ta remained stable, so transgenic hairy root lines p <dig>  t <dig> and pt <dig> showed higher total antioxidant activity of ta due to higher total ta content they produced.

hyoscyamine-6-hydroxylase  catalyzes the oxidative reactions in the biosynthetic pathway leading from hyoscyamine to scopolamine and is also an effective regulatory site for the synthesis and accumulation of ta  <cit> . therefore, in order to enhance the levels of ta and the capacity to convert hyoscyamine to much more scopolamine and anisodine, co-overexpression of multiple biosynthetic genes such as aapmt, aatri and aah6h in a. acutangulus may be a new promising strategy in the near future. in addition, anisodine is also an imperative tropane alkaloid in the market, which was first produced in hairy root cultures. this result suggested anisodine could be biosynthesized by ta biosynthesis pathway, which provided helpful information for our ensuing research.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, co-overexpression of aapmt and aatri genes in a. acutangulus hairy roots led to significantly increased production of four kinds of ta and showed higher antioxidant activity than control because of higher total ta content. this is the first report on simultaneous introduction of pmt and tri genes into ta-producing plant using biotechnological methods. our study results showed that transgenic hairy root culture system is a promising approach for improvement and large-scale production of ta in the future.
