BACKGROUND
the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome that contains two superhelical turns of dna wrapped around an octamer of two copies each of the core histones h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . resolution of the nucleosome structure revealed that the n-terminal histone tails protrude from the nucleosomal core in an unstructured manner  <cit>  and contain an ever-growing number of post-translational modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and more recently, citrullination  <cit> . importantly, these modifications, or “marks”, play critical roles in many cellular functions, including dna replication, condensation, and repair, as well as gene regulation  <cit> . of these modifications, histone acetylation is perhaps most strongly associated with gene regulation. increasing levels of histone acetylation are correlated with a transcriptionally permissive state whereas deacetylated histone are closely associated with transcriptional repression  <cit> . histone acetylation is also implicated in the activation of embryonic gene expression in preimplantation embryos  <cit> . for example, previous reports investigating late two-cell embryos have found that inducing histone hyperacetylation with hdac inhibitors stimulates global transcription  <cit>  and depletion of hdac <dig> by rnai results in elevated levels of specific gene targets  <cit> . previous studies in somatic cells have demonstrated that specific histone modifications can directly affect the levels of other marks and this interplay leads to a complex mechanism of gene regulation, frequently referred to as the “histone code”  <cit> . while fewer of these types of studies have been carried out in early embryos, several reports have found that cross-talk exist between histone acetylation and histone methylation in normal and cloned embryos  <cit> .

padi enzymes are increasingly being associated with the regulation of chromatin structure and gene activity via histone citrullination. for example, we have found that padi4-mediated citrullination of histone h <dig> arginine  <dig> at the tff1promoter in mcf <dig> cells appears to regulate the expression of this canonical estrogen receptor target  <cit> . others have shown that padi4-mediated histone citrullination plays a role in regulating other target genes such as trp <dig> and okl <dig> <cit> . in addition to padi <dig>  we recently found that padi <dig> localizes to the nucleus of mammary epithelial cells and appears to target histone h <dig> for citrullination  <cit> , thus suggesting that multiple padis regulate chromatin-based activities.

we have previously documented that oocyte -and-embryo abundant padi <dig> is required for female fertility, with padi6-null embryos arresting at the two-cell stage of development  <cit> . given the growing body of literature linking padi enzymes to histone citrullination and the abundance of padi <dig> in oocytes and early embryos, we first tested whether histones were citrullinated in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. next, we treated embryos with the padi-specific inhibitor, cl-amidine, to confirm that the observed citrulline marks were generated by padi activity and also to test whether inhibition of padi activity may affect preimplantation development in vitro. lastly, to gain insight into potential mechanisms by which histone citrullination may regulate gene activity, we tested whether inhibition of padi activity in early embryos affects histone acetylation and whether induction of histone hypoacetylation affected levels of histone citrullination. findings from this study are discussed below.

RESULTS
citrullination of histone h <dig> and h <dig> tails in oocytes and in preimplantation embryos appears to be robust and dynamic
in the present study, the status of histone h <dig> and h <dig> citrullination during early development was investigated by staining fully grown mouse germinal vesicle  stage oocytes and preimplantation embryos with three site-specific citrullinated histone antibodies: anti-histone h <dig> citrulline  <dig> , anti-histone h <dig> citrulline  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and anti-histone h <dig> citrulline  <dig>   <cit> . results from these confocal indirect immunofluorescence studies showed that h4cit <dig> staining was observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of oocytes and early embryos at interphase. interestingly, the strongest staining for this citrulline modification appears to occur on mitotic metaphase chromatin, suggesting that h4cit <dig> may play a role in chromatin condensation or decondensation at metaphase . staining with the anti-h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig> antibody found that this modification also stained nuclei during interphase . however, at metaphase, this antibody appeared to primarily stain the spindle apparatus  and a structure at opposed regions of two cell blastomeres that appears to be the microtubule-containing mid-body  <cit>  . interestingly, in somatic cells, an anti-phospho-h <dig> serine  <dig> antibody detected histones with this modification at the anaphase spindle apparatus and at the mid-body during cytokinesis  <cit> . these investigators speculated that this modification may mark histones for removal from the nucleosome or possibly that this modified histone may actually play a direct role in cytokinesis by functioning at the mid-body  <cit> . it is currently not known whether citrullinated histones in the cytoplasm of oocytes and early embryos might have a similar function. alternatively, however, it is also possible that the observed spindle and mid-body staining with the h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig> antibody is non-specific in nature.

the staining pattern observed with the anti-h3cit <dig> was perhaps the most interesting of all. results found that both oocytes and early embryos showed a strong punctate cytoplasmic signal that appeared to coalesce into larger aggregates as the embryos developed  and these foci appeared by light microscopy to be lipid droplets. to test this hypothesis we stained mutant mater gv oocytes  with nile red or with the h3cit <dig> antibody. results show  that the h3cit26-containing cytoplasmic foci clearly appear to be lipid droplets. interestingly, a recent study found that lipid droplets in drosophila embryos are maternally-derived and that these structures contain ~50% of all embryonic histones. this finding suggests that the lipid droplets function to sequester maternal histones in the early embryo until they are needed for chromatin-based activities  <cit> . an intriguing possibility is that the h3cit <dig> modification marks histones for lipid droplet storage and/or possibly shuttling histones between lipid droplets and the nucleus. h3cit <dig> staining within the nucleus was also interesting; whereas little to no signal was seen in gv stage oocytes, strong staining was observed on the outer margins of both male and female pronuclei and around the nucleoli of two-cell embryos . by the four-cell stage of development no nuclear staining was observed. given that embryonic genome activation is known to initiate at the late pronuclear/early two-cell stage, this observation raises the possibility that this particular citrulline modification may play a role in activation of the embryonic genome. taken together, our data raise the possibility that the different histone modification sites may play different roles in preimplantation development.

given that each of these anti-citrullinated histone antibodies showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization patterns, we next confirmed the specificity of our antibodies by testing whether pre-absorption of the antibodies with their cognate peptide affected indirect immunofluorescence signal intensity levels . results showed that peptide preabsorption suppressed the fluorescence intensity for each of the three antibodies . these results suggest that the localization patterns observed for the h4cit <dig>  h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig>  and h3cit <dig> are specific.

cl-amidine blocks mouse embryonic development beyond the two to four cell stage in vitro
the above observations suggested that padi-mediated histone citrullination may play an important, previously unknown, role in early development. given that padi <dig> is essential for early cleavage divisions, we next tested whether levels of these modifications were reduced in padi6-null mouse oocytes/early embryos. we found that loss of padi <dig> did not appear to affect histone citrullination levels . given padi4’s previously documented roles in histone citrullination and gene regulation  <cit> , we then tested citrullinated histone levels in padi4-null oocytes. again, we did not observe any appreciable loss in levels of citrullinated histone in this mutant line . together, these observations suggest, neither padi <dig> nor padi <dig> catalyze these specific citrulline modifications on histones in oocytes or early embryos.

given these observations, and the lack of mutant padi <dig>  padi <dig>  and padi <dig> mouse lines, we next decided to test the effects of a newly developed padi inhibitor, cl-amidine, on histone citrullination and on early embryonic development. cl-amidine has been shown to irreversibly block the activity of all padi enzymes in vitro and has also been shown in cell culture and mouse-based assays to functionally inhibit padi activity in vivo <cit> . we first tested whether cl-amidine suppressed citrulline levels on histones in early embryos using the h4cit <dig>  h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig>  and h3cit <dig> antibodies. pn zygotes were cultured in ksom media supplemented without or with  <dig> μm of cl-amidine. embryos at the 4-cell stage from ksom and cl-amidine groups were fixed after being cultured for ~ <dig> hours and ~ <dig> hours, respectively, to ensure developmental arrest at cleavage stage. next, the embryos were stained with the anti-citrullinated histone antibodies and then evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscopy. results showed that staining levels for the h4cit <dig> and h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig> antibodies was reduced, compared with the ksom control group . interestingly, however, cl-amidine treatment did not appear to affect levels of the h3cit <dig> modification, suggesting that histone citrullination at this site may have occurred in oocytes prior to drug treatment . actin levels and localization did not appear to be affected by cl-amidine. these results support the hypothesis that the histone citrullination in embryos is catalyzed by padi activity.

we next investigated the effects of cl-amidine on embryonic development in vitro. as a control for these experiments, we also tested the effect of h-amidine on development. this analog displays very weak padi inhibitory activity  <cit>  with, for example, the ic <dig> values of cl-amidine and h-amidine for pad <dig> inhibition in vitro being  <dig>  μm and > 1000μm, respectively  <cit> . the structures of these two compounds are shown in figure 2d and 2e. pn stage zygotes were cultured for ~ <dig> hours in ksom media supplemented with  <dig> μm of either cl-amidine or h-amidine. the number and developmental stage of embryos was then evaluated using light microscopy. results showed that embryos arrested either at the 2- <dig> cell stage  or at the 1-cell stage  in the cl-amidine group, while  <dig> % of embryos  in the h-amidine group and  <dig> % of embryos  in ksom medium alone developed to the morula stage . we note here that  the concentration of cl-amidine used in our study is within the range of that used to functionally block padi activity in somatic cells  <cit>  and that  lower concentrations of cl-amidine did not affect embryonic development . our finding that cl-amidine suppressed histone citrullination in cleavage-stage embryos suggested that the observed effects of cl-amidine on development were due to specific inhibition of padi activity. however, it is also possible that the inhibitor blocked development because of non-specific toxic side-effects. to address this possibility, we first examined embryo viability following cl-amidine and h-amidine treatment using the vital dye propidium iodide . results showed that nuclei from both cl-amidine and h-amidine treated  embryos were not stained with pi  while nuclei from embryos that were treated with cl-amidine and extracted with  <dig> % triton were strongly stained with pi . these results indicate that the plasma membrane of cl-amidine and h-amidine treated embryos appeared functional. to further confirm embryo viability, we next evaluated the mitochondrial membrane potential of cl-amidine and h-amidine treated embryos using the jc- <dig> fluorescent dye, which accumulates in functional mitochondria as red-staining aggregates . results showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential appeared to be similar between the cl-amidine and h-amidine treatment groups, suggesting the cl-amidine does not affect mitochondrial health. together, these findings suggest that padi activity is required for progression of embryonic development beyond the two to four cell stage.

treatment of embryos with c-amidine suppresses histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation while having no apparent effect on the repressive h3k <dig> di-methyl modification
as noted, histone acetylation is well correlated with activation of gene expression in somatic cells and is also believed to play an important role in modulating gene expression in preimplantation embryos  <cit> . in order to begin testing whether histone citrullination may play a role regulating gene activity in early embryos, we tested whether suppression of histone citrullination with cl-amidine affected levels of histone acetylation on h <dig> and h <dig> tails. results showed that cl-amidine treatment significantly reduced levels of histone h <dig> acetylation . the fluorescent intensities for hyper acetylated h <dig>  and h4k <dig> acetyl  in cl-amidine, tsa, and ksom groups were presented in figure 3b and 3f. additionally, cl-amidine also dramatically reduced the level of acetylation on the h <dig> tail, namely h3k <dig> acetyl  and h3k <dig> acetyl  . the fluorescent intensities for these modifications were showed in figure 3b and 3d. to gain further insight into the mechanisms by which histone citrullination may regulate gene activity, we also tested whether cl-amidine affected levels of di-methylated histone h3k <dig>  a modification closely associated with transcriptional repression  <cit> . we found that levels of this modification were not significantly affected by cl-amidine treatment . to validate the specificity of the acetylated histone antibodies, the embryos were also treated with the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a , and as expected, staining for acetylated histones  was elevated following tsa treatment . taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of padi-mediated histone citrullination suppresses histone acetylation.

histone hyperacetylation promotes histone citrullination in early embryos
to further explore the potential interplay between histone citrullination and acetylation, the colocalization of citrullination at h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> and acetylation at h3k <dig> was tested in 2-cell embryos. results revealed that these two histone modifications localize, in part, to different regions of the nucleus, and they do appear to colocalize at specific foci in 2-cell embryos . to further test whether there was a potential crosstalk between histone citrullination and acetylation, levels of h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> citrullination were examined in embryos treated with either tsa or cl-amidine. to perform this experiment, pn zygotes were recovered from b6d2f1/j females and cultured in ksom medium supplemented with either  <dig> nm of tsa or  <dig> μm of cl-amidine, respectively, for ~ <dig> hours. results showed that, as expected, levels of h3cit2 + 18 +  <dig> were significantly reduced following cl-amidine treatment . interestingly, however, we found that induction of histone hyperactylation via tsa treatment also resulted in significantly increased levels of citrullination at h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> . this observation further suggests that there is a reinforcing relationship between acetylation and citrullination and further highlights the potential interplay between these two modifications on chromatin in preimplantation mammalian embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
this report is the first to document the presence of citrullinated histones in mammalian oocytes and preimplantation embryos. the use of three site-specific citrullinated histone antibodies found that histone citrullination is likely playing several unique, yet to be defined roles on chromatin templated events. we found that the padi inhibitor, cl-amidine, potently blocks embryonic development beyond the 4-cell stage, thus further highlighting the important role of padis in early development. this observation also raises the possibility that padi inhibitors could potentially be utilized as novel contraceptives. our study also showed that cl-amidine specifically suppressed histone acetylation on the h <dig> and h <dig> tails while not affecting levels of the transcriptionally repressive histone h3k <dig> dimethyl modification. further, we found that induction of histone hyperacetylation leads to enhanced histone citrullination. mechanistically, as with numerous other histone modifications  <cit> , these observations raise the distinct possibility that the citrulline modification on histones may function as a “platform” for binding by histone acetyltransferases , thus facilitating transcriptional activation by enhancing levels of histone acetylation. more detailed studies are now required to test this hypothesis. we predict that outcomes from the current study will likely lead to new and important insight into epigenetic regulation of the oocyte to embryo transition.
