BACKGROUND
sequence comparison is traditionally carried out using alignments. the alignment procedure ensures that only homologous positions are compared and corresponding algorithms form the classical core of bioinformatics  <cit> . once a sequence alignment has been computed, it can be used to determine, for example, signature oligonucleotides or unique genomic regions among a group of closely related organisms.

perhaps surprisingly, the applications of alignments just mentioned – signature oligos and detection of unique genomic regions – do not necessarily involve an alignment step. since the computation of alignments tends to take time proportional to the product of the lengths of the sampled sequences, elimination of this step often leads to dramatic increases in the speed of sequence analysis algorithms  <cit> .

our method of alignment-free sequence comparison is based on the idea of "shortest unique substrings", that is, the shortest substrings of a sequence which are not found elsewhere. consider for example the sequence s = accg. it contains  substrings, of which the following eight are unique: {a, ac, acc, accg, cc, ccg, cg, g}. two of these are shortest unique substrings: {a, g}. such global shortest unique substrings can occur anywhere in s. in contrast, we define local shortest unique substrings to be tied to a specific position in s. more formally, we determine for every position i in s the length x of the substring s such that it is unique while s is not. in the case of our example string, the result is x =  <dig> for the first position, x =  <dig> for the second, x =  <dig> for the third, and x =  <dig> for the last. figure 1a gives a graphical representation of these local shortest unique substrings.

so far we have only considered the forward strand of a given dna sequence. in the presence of the reverse strand, the set of x-values changes to x =  <dig> for the first and x =  <dig> for the second position. no well-defined unique substrings start at the third or the last position of the sequence. figure 1b illustrates the shortest unique substrings found on the forward and reverse strands of our example sequence. it is important to realize that when dealing with double-stranded dna, the set of shortest unique substrings is different from that found in single-stranded dna. however, complementarity of dna ensures that the complement of a local shortest unique substring is again a unique substring, though not necessarily a shortest unique substring . in contrast, the complement of a global shortest unique substring is also a global shortest unique substring.

application of shortest unique substrings to biological problems requires both their efficient detection and knowledge of their probability distribution. the latter is derived in this paper. as to the detection of shortest unique substrings, a data structure known as the suffix tree can readily be used for this purpose  <cit> . we demonstrate the utility of shortest unique substrings for sequence analysis by applying them to three tasks:  identification of signature oligo nucleotide sequences,  detection of unique as well as repeat regions in the genome of mycoplasma genitalium, and  detection of unique genomic regions in strain mssa <dig> of the human pathogen staphylococcus aureus when compared to four other staphylococcal genomes.

RESULTS
global shortest unique substrings in caenorhabditis elegans, human, and mouse
the genome of c. elegans is one of the smallest metazoan genomes sequenced to date. it consists of five autosomes and one sex chromosome, amounting to  <dig>  mb of sequence information  <cit> . when searching for global shortest unique substrings in this genome, we found a single complementary pair of unique motifs of length  <dig> located on chromosome  <dig>  considering the next shortest unique substrings  we found a total of  <dig>  such motif pairs distributed among the five chromosomes. note that the search for these globally unique substrings was done with respect to the forward and backward strands of the complete genome.

we repeated this analysis for the human genome, which is the largest genome sequenced to date. it consists of  <dig> autosomes and two sex chromosomes totalling  <dig>  gb published sequence data  <cit> . we found  <dig> pairs of global shortest unique substrings of length  <dig> distributed on the autosomes and the x-chromosome. the y chromosome contained no unique sequences of length  <dig> but  <dig> globally unique sequence pairs of length  <dig> 

we were puzzled by the fact that – with the exception of the single instance of a unique substring pair of length  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> of c. elegans – the shortest unique substrings in humans had the same length  as those found in c. elegans, even though the human genome is  <dig> times larger than that of the nematode. when repeating the search for global shortest unique substrings in the mouse genome, whose size is similar to that of human , we found a matching result: there were  <dig> shortest unique substring pairs of length  <dig> distributed among the autosomes and the x-chromosome. on the y-chromosome there were  <dig> unique substring pairs of length  <dig>  the fact that the highly repetitive y chromosome contained global unique substrings of length  <dig> as compared to length  <dig> on autosomes suggested that the length of shortest unique substrings is inversely related to genome information content. in order to further explore whether particularly short unique substrings are associated with functional regions of the genome, we investigated the distribution of globally shortest unique substrings among  <dig> kb upstream regions of annotated genes.

a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> ×  <dig> shortest unique substrings were located among a non-redundant set of  <dig>  human  <dig> kb upstream regions. the probability of observing a single hit in an upstream region with one shortest unique substring is equal to the fraction of the published genome  covered by upstream regions. this is

fh =  <dig> × 1000/ ≈  <dig> .

the probability of observing  <dig> or more hits to upstream regions under the null hypothesis of equal distribution is



a similar result was obtained for the mouse genome. here a total of  <dig>  non-redundant upstream regions contained  <dig> of the  <dig> ×  <dig> shortest unique substrings. the probability of finding a single hit with one shortest unique substring is again equal to the fraction of the published genome covered by the upstream regions:

fm =  <dig> × 1000/ ≈  <dig> .

the probability of observing  <dig> or more hits to upstream regions by chance is



in other words, both in the human as well as in the mouse genome shortest unique substrings are clustered close to genes. a complete list of the shortest unique substrings with hits to upstream regions is available as supplementary material .

so far we have concentrated on the overall, i.e. global, shortest unique substrings. in the following sections we extend this analysis to include all local shortest unique substrings.

empirical distribution of local shortest unique substring lengths
the pathogenic bacterium mycoplasma genitalium has one of the smallest genomes known for any free-living organism  <cit> . the  <dig>  bp of its genome encode  <dig> open reading frames and would be expected to be void of redundant, that is repetitive, sequences. however, when plotting the length of all local shortest unique substrings contained in its genome, we detected  <dig> non-overlapping shortest unique sequences longer than  <dig> bp, the longest of which spanned  <dig> bp . in other words, the genome of m. genitalium contains a perfectly conserved repeat sequence that is  <dig> -  <dig> =  <dig> bp long. the statistical significance of these repeats is illustrated in figure 2b, which displays the lengths of the shortest unique substrings in a shuffled version of m. genitalium's genome. in such a scrambled sequence devoid of biological meaning no shortest unique substring is longer than  <dig> bp. having found surprisingly short, as well as surprisingly long shortest unique substrings, we proceed by deriving the null distribution of shortest unique substring lengths.

distribution of local shortest unique substring lengths
as explained further in the methods section, the probability of finding shortest unique substrings of length x, , is the number of unique substrings of length x, , minus the number of unique substrings of length x -  <dig>  , divided by the genome length l:



where



and 2p represents the gc-content of the genome . figure  <dig> demonstrates that the fit between equation  and the empirical distribution of local shortest unique substrings  is excellent. equation  provides an efficient method for establishing the statistical significance of any given length of a local shortest unique substring. using equation  and knowing that the gc-content of the genome of c. elegans is  <dig> , one expects to find by chance alone  <dig>  unique substrings of length and  <dig> and  <dig>  unique substrings of length  <dig>  these values agree with what we have found in the actual genome of c. elegans . however, again based on equation , the probability of finding in the human genome  a unique substring of length  <dig> is less than 10- <dig>  this is equivalent to an expected number of only  <dig>  × 10- <dig> of such unique substrings and in sharp contrast to the observed value of  <dig> pairs of unique substrings of this length. the same holds for mouse. clearly, the lengths of the shortest unique substrings found in mouse and human cannot be explained by chance.

in addition to quantifying the probability of finding shortest unique substrings, equation  also allows us to estimate the lengths of unique oligos for arbitrary genomes. in the case of the human genome the length distribution is shown in figure  <dig>  notice that this distribution is strongly skewed to the right with  <dig> being the highest length with an expected occupancy of ≥  <dig> 

since equation  describes the length distribution of shortest unique substrings in random sequences, it is also the null-distribution for multiple, but phylogenetically unrelated, sequences. this fact can be exploited for comparative genome analysis.

comparing five strains of staphylococcus aureus
staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen notorious for its resistance to multiple antibiotics  <cit> . five genomes of this bacterium are publicly available, which makes it one of the best characterized bacterial species. our aim was to take strain mssa <dig>  <cit>  and identify the regions unique to its genome when compared to the four other strains available. given the gc-content of staphylococcus aureus and the combined length of the five genomes analyzed, we calculated the expected distribution of shortest unique substring lengths using equation . figure  <dig> shows that for unrelated s. aureus sequences of the same combined length  and composition  as the strains investigated, the lengths of shortest unique substrings are expected to range from  <dig> to  <dig>  we decided to analyze the local shortest unique substrings of length ≤  <dig> in strain mssa <dig> in the presence of the genomes of the four other strains. figure  <dig> displays the cumulative distribution of the local shortest unique substrings of length ≤  <dig> along the genome of strain mssa <dig>  regions unique to mssa <dig> contain a high density of such substrings and hence stand out as jumps in the cumulative plot. figure  <dig> shows two such jumps. these correspond exactly to the two unique regions Φsa <dig> and scc <dig> recently annotated as the only two unique regions in mssa <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
the search for unique substrings has a long tradition in molecular biology. it is fundamental for many sequence-based identification techniques, and affects pcr primer design as well as the development of specific antibodies. a dna or protein sequence of length n contains  substrings, which is also an upper limit for the number of unique substrings. this means that in most real world situations there is in an excess of unique substrings to choose from. since a given unique substring remains unique upon extension, we decided to concentrate on the shortest unique substrings. in their global version they have minimal length with respect to the entire sample of sequences investigated. in contrast, their local version is defined for substrings starting from a specific position in the genome. there are of the order of n such local shortest unique substrings from which all the remaining unique substrings can be generated. shortest unique substrings therefore lead to considerable space reduction when dealing with unique substrings.

our technique for detecting such unique substrings is applicable to protein as well as to dna sequence data. antibodies are widely used in basic biomedical research; in addition, there is growing interest in applying them as therapeutics. a major design goal in generating antibodies to a given protein in all of these contexts is to maximize their specificity. since the entire proteome of important biomedical model organisms, including human, is known, epitope selection might be guided not only by considerations of antigenicity, but also of uniqueness. in a preliminary study of the human proteome we found that 88% of the  <dig>  human proteins we looked at contain at least one unique hexapeptide. given that a typical epitope consists of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, this suggests that our method of detecting shortest unique substrings coupled with epitope prediction programs might also be useful for antibody development.

however, in this paper we have concentrated on shortest unique substrings in genomes. the fact that the length of global shortest unique substrings does not exceed  <dig> in autosomes of both c. elegans and humans is intriguing given the widely differing sizes of the two genomes and the extremely small probability of observing unique sequences of length  <dig> by chance in the human genome. since the length of global shortest unique substrings remained constant after we had removed repetitive elements from the genomes, we take this as an indication that genomes contain a core of high-complexity sequences which determine the length of global shortest unique substrings. the size of this high-complexity core is apparently much less variable across metazoan genomes than raw genome size, hence the observed constancy of global shortest unique substring lengths.

these global shortest unique substrings can be used as starting points for developing signature oligos. such oligos are widely used in biotechnology and taxonomy. a typical application in biotechnology is pcr-primers that should be unique to the target sequence. in taxonomy a recent initiative for the "barcoding of life"  attempts to "label" all extant species by assigning a short unique dna-sequence to them.

the probability of finding a shortest unique substring of some length can be readily computed using equation . however, this equation is highly sensitive to the value of the parameter p, which describes the sequence composition. hence, local variation in sequence composition will strongly affect the expected length of both local and global shortest unique substrings. this fact may also have contributed to our observation that shortest unique substrings cluster in upstream regions of genes in both the mouse and the human genomes. the euchromatic part of the human genome has an average gc-content of  <dig>  , which is similar to the value of  <dig>  for the mouse . in contrast, the global shortest unique substrings we found in humans have a gc-content of  <dig>  and those found in mouse have a gc-content of  <dig> . the upstream regions of genes tend to be gc-rich in human  as well as mouse , which might account for the clustering of global shortest unique substrings in these regions.

detection of unique genomic regions is traditionally done by alignment-based approaches. however, the run-time of these algorithms depends non-linearly on the number and lengths of the input sequences and also on the degree of relatedness of the input sequences. in contrast, the scheme for detecting unique genomic regions proposed in this paper has a run time that is strictly linear in the combined lengths of the input sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
there is currently a lot of interest in comparative genomics  <cit> . in many of these projects detection of regions unique to a genome is one of the first steps towards functional annotation . given equation , the size distribution of shortest unique substrings in random, i.e. unrelated, sequences can be predicted. this leads to our method of detecting unique genomic regions from an arbitrary set of input sequences without the need for alignment. its usefulness for comparative genomics is clearly demonstrated in the case of the genomes of s. aureus, where we could rapidly detect the two unique regions previously annotated in one strain  <cit>  .
