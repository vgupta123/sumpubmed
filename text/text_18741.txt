BACKGROUND
socompa is a high altitude andean lake  located at the base of the still active socompa volcano, at the northwestern part of argentina in the puna region, at about  <dig>  meters above the sea level . this lake presents unique features such as high alkalinity, hypersalinity and extremely high arsenic concentration. additionally, actively forming stromatolites inhabit the socompa lake  <cit> . stromatolites are considered evidence of early life on earth with geological records dating back to  <dig>  billion years . the term stromatolites has been raising discussions since its introduction by kalkowsky in  <dig>  and therefore, in this work we will follow, in this work, the recently established concept that “stromatolites are macroscopically layered authigenic microbial sediments with or without interlayered abiogenic precipitates”  <cit> . modern stromatolites have been recorded in only a few locations and, in general, at low to medium altitudes, with the exception of the obsidian pool in the yellowstone national park located about  <dig>  masl .

the study of microbes associated with socompa stromatolites and their environment could provide further understanding of the evolution under extremely harsh conditions. vibrio costicola was first described by smith in  <dig>  <cit> . this species was then transferred to the new genus salinivibrio
 <cit> , which today comprises four species . the most recently described species is salinivibrio sharmensis
 <cit> . salinivibrios are moderately halophilic bacteria distributed in salted meats, brines and hypersaline environments. they have developed cellular mechanisms to thrive in extremophilic conditions, such as hypersalinity  <cit> . salinivibrio costicola has been used as a model organism for studies of osmoregulation and other physiological mechanisms  <cit> . however, little is known concerning the genomic and phenotypic repertoire of salinivibrios related to survival under high uv radiation, salinity and arsenic concentration. the study of salinivibrios from the socompa lake could provide us with a better understanding of the attributes of these bacteria and of possible aspects of genome evolution related to extreme environments.

in the course of the study of the microbial diversity of stromatolites at the socompa lake, a collection of salinivibrios was obtained . we then used ion torrent sequencing to evaluate the genomic repertoire of three novel representative strains related to life in an extreme environment. in addition, we evaluated the phenotypic attributes  of the three strains. our aim was to determine the possible genomic and phenotypic attributes that allow the three novel salinivibrio strains to inhabit the socompa lake.figure  <dig>

RESULTS
general features of the three novel salinivibriostrains
salinivibrio spp. s10b, s <dig> and s <dig> strains were isolated from stromatolite, sediment and water of socompa lake  respectively, during february  <dig> . the isolated strains presented rounded, entire edges and cream pinkish colonies. the cells are gram-negative, motile, non-sporulating curved rods. the re-annotated genome of the salinivibrio costicola subsp. costicola atcc <dig> and the genomes sequenced of the salinivibrio spp. s10b, s <dig> and s <dig> covered total length of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,510 bp, respectively. for the newly sequenced salinivibrios, estimated coverage depths of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> fold, and average gc contents of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were observed . in the genome of the salinivibrio spp. s10b, s <dig> and s <dig>  the annotation by rast identified  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  coding sequences , respectively. on average, 29% of the cds in the salinivibrio strains were annotated as hypothetical proteins. we observed the presence of specific genes in each strain by pairwise reciprocal blastn analysis using strain s <dig> as reference . strain s <dig>  showed  <dig> genes with no similarity to the other strains. the majority of these genes  were annotated as hypothetical proteins. the remaining genes were related to with osmotic stress, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats elements , crispr-associated  modules  and capsular polysaccharide synthesis enzyme that are involved to development of biofilms . the biofilm formation may be a strategy for survival during periods of nutrient scarcity  <cit> , protection against environmental changes  <cit> , trapping and absorbing nutrients, resistance to antibiotics, and for the establishing of favorable interactions with other bacteria  <cit> . also, the extracellular matrix substances produced by s <dig>  may be important as a site of mineral nucleation in the stromatolite  <cit> . the crispr-cas modules, on the other hand, constitute adaptive immunity systems found in several prokaryotic communities and are associated with defense against the invasion of foreign genetic elements  <cit> .figure  <dig>

genomes. the figure shows blastn results using salinivibrio sp. s <dig> as reference sequence against other salinivibrio genomes .



strain s <dig>  presented  <dig> genes, which were not detected in the other strains. a total of 60% of these genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins. the other genes were annotated into cobalamine biosynthesis, tra elements and type ii/iv secretion systems among others . considering the water column origin, strain s <dig> could be positively interacting with dominant diatomite of socompa lake water  and stromatolites  through exudates of cobalamin, a vitamin which is necessary for the development of such microalgae communities  <cit> . diatoms may, in turn, provide labile dissolved organic matter for the salinivibrios. this plausible ecological interaction suggests that further studies are needed in order to unravel the microbial ecology of the socompa lake.

finally, salinivibrio sp. s10b  revealed  <dig> exclusive genes when compared with the other sequenced strains. besides hypothetical genes , this pool also contained several orfs with similarity to phage genes . the majority of phage related genes are flanked by is elements, trnas, and integrases genes, indicating an important role of horizontal genetic transfer in genome evolution in the socompa lake. the specific genomic content of each salinivibrio strain could be related with unique metabolic properties of these strains in response to their distinct ecological niches. to this end, efforts toward the characterization of the majority of the strains-specific genes with unknown function  will be critical.

taxonomic assignment
phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequences  and multilocus sequence analysis  classified the three novel strains s10b, s <dig> and s <dig> in a tight monophyletic group in the genus salinivibrio . strains s10b, s <dig> and s <dig> showed more than  <dig> % mutual 16s rrna and multilocus sequence similarity . they were most closely related to the s. costicola species, presenting between  <dig>  and  <dig> % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with s. costicola subsp. alcaliphilus 18gt and between  <dig>  and  <dig> % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with and s. costicola subsp. costicola atcc <dig>  however, a closer taxonomic examination of the genomes indicated that the three novel strains had only 93% amino acid identity  and < 70% in silico genome-to-genome hybridization similarity  with the type strain of s. costicola subsp. costicola . these values are below the thresholds for species characterization  <cit> . we suggest that the novel strains  may belong to a new species of the salinivibrio genus, for which we propose the name salinivibrio socompensis . the three novel strains can also be distinguished from the closest taxon s. costicola subsp. alcaliphilus by means of several genomic features such as the presence of genes necessary for starch hydrolysis, and the lack of genes for hydrolysis of gelatin, nitrate reduction and tyrosine decomposition, characteristics found in s. costicola subsp. alcaliphilus, type strain 18agt
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

resistance to nacl, arsenic and uv-b radiation
the novel salinivibrio strains showed similar phenotypic characteristics concerning their resistance to extreme conditions . salt tolerance was lower in the three novel salinivibrio strains than in the s. costicola subsp. alcaliphilus and s. costicola subsp. costicola. these subspecies tolerate up to 25% nacl  <cit> . the three novel strains grew on plates up to 15% of nacl, but not in the absence of this salt . under an intensity of  <dig>  w/m <dig>  the strains resisted to uv-b radiations as high as  <dig> kj/m <dig> . unexpectedly, the assay showed a growth recovery in 120 minutes, suggesting physiologic response through dna damage inducible sos system . the three novel strains were able to grow in 200 mm of arsenate  and  <dig>  mm arsenite  .figure  <dig>

the draft genomes of three novel strains contain genes with a potential role in dna repair. we found the complete set of genes for recbcd helicase/nuclease and uvrabc endonuclease holoenzymes, respectively involved in the recombinational repair of double strand which breaks in dna and “short-patch” of genetic mutations by excision and replacement of aberrant nucleotides. homologs for reca and recx genes were also detected in the genomes of strains s <dig> and s <dig>  the ssdna binding protein reca acts centrally in sos response  and other homologous-recombination-based dna repair, initiating the exchange of strands between two recombining dna molecules. recx modulates reca activity by direct protein-protein interaction, blocking the extension of reca filaments to avoid aberrant dna transactions  <cit> . dna damage in salinivibrio strains may result in from ionizing radiation, oxidative damage, and a range of other factors  <cit> .

in addition, the novel salinivibrio strains contained gene homologs of deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase, and one gene coding for a transcriptional regulator of the mer family, associated with photolyases. deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyases catalyze the light-dependent monomerization  of cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers, which are formed between adjacent bases on the same dna strand upon exposure to uv radiation . these proteins have no significant similarity to salinivibrio costicola subsp. costicola atcc <dig>  the existence and the efficiency of these proteins in haal were already reported in strains of the genus acinetobacter
 <cit> . the uv-b resistance observed for the isolated salinivibrio strains  was lower than the one observed for acinetobacter isolates from haal, but higher than the one observed for spore forming bacteria isolated from high altitudes air  <cit> , reinforcing the ecologic versatility of these salinivibrio strains.

one of the most impressive features of the socompa lake is the high arsenic content in the water  <cit> , which is around the concentration of such metalloid encountered in the mono soda lake, california   <cit> . in general, these concentrations are lethal for a variety of microbes, but some specialized bacteria have evolved mechanisms of resistance to toxic levels of arsenic, which, in most cases, are based on the production of oxidoreductases that act on the prevailing inorganic arsenic oxidative states, 5+  and 3+   <cit> . the three novel salinivibrios were slightly less resistant to arsenic than exiguobacterium from the same lake  <cit> , but they grew on higher arsenic concentrations than the ones tested in gfaj- <dig> strain from the mono lake  <cit> .

the three novel salinivibrio strains presented homologs to the five genes composing the arsenate and arsenite resistance operon arsrdabc  firstly characterized in escherichia coli plasmid r <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, arsdac genes were not detected in the genomic contents of the s. costicola atcc <dig> strain. in this detoxification system the cytoplasmic oxidoreductase arsc reduces arsenate to arsenite in an atp-glutathione-glutaredoxin dependent way, and the toxic arsenite is excreted by the arsab efflux pump  <cit> . arsd is a metallochaperone that scavenges arsenite from the cytosol and transfers it to the arsab pump atpase component, arsa, increasing arsenite extrusion rate to confer resistance even when it is present at low and subtoxic concentrations  <cit> . arsr is an operon trans-acting transcriptional regulator. in the strains s <dig> and s10b all genes arsdac are disposed contiguously reinforcing the idea of an active operon, while in strain s <dig>  the putative arsd is placed at a different genomic locus distant from arsac . the arsdac genes were not detected in the genome of s. costicola atcc <dig>  the putative arsa from s <dig> and s10b are highly similar ,  <dig> amino acid  long proteins, containing two catalytic domains in tandem. these hypothetical proteins are also similar  to the characterized arsa atpase from escherichia coli, a  <dig> aa long protein that also contains two homologous domains  connected by a flexible linker. both e. coli arsa domains bind and hydrolyze atp when activated by arsenite or antimonite , and the loss of either domain leads to the loss of the enzymatic activity  <cit> . on the other hand, arsa from strain s <dig> codes for a one domain only shorter protein  . the putative arsa domain from s <dig> is identical to a <dig> domain from the arsa of isolates s <dig> and s10b . additionally, the putative arsb from isolate s <dig> codes for a protein truncated at both the carboxi  and amino-termini  portions. arsc-dependent arsenate detoxification systems are ubiquitously found in bacteria  <cit> . indeed, a putative additional and thioredoxin-dependent arsc enzyme was also detected in the genomes of the three salinivibrio strains and the type strain s. costicola, which lacks an arsdabc-like operon. all three novel strains also presented from one to three copies of an arsb arsenite efflux pump. finally, putative genes for the key molybdoproteins involved in arsenite oxidation coupled with to oxygen or nitrite  reduction , or arsenate reduction to arsenite in anaerobic respiratory process  were not detected in the genomes of the three novel salinivibrio strains by automatic annotation or blast searches.figure  <dig>

strains. the double slash represents genes placed at a different genomic locus. arrows indicate the transcriptional orientation; the asterisk indicates that all genes are positioned in reverse strand. the gray arrows indicate hypothetical proteins. hp, hypothetical proteins; gadh, nad-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase .



another characteristic of the salinivibrios from socompa lake and the s. costicola subsp. costicola atcc <dig> is the absence of primary na + pumps in their genomic contents, as seen in several other alkaliphiles and hyperthermophiles bacteria . the analyzed salinivibrio spp. only have secondary transporters, with na symports being the principal. glycine, alanine, phosphate, glutamate, propionate and proline could be taken up by these cells by na symport mechanism. the similarity between the three novel salinivibrios from socompa and the atcc <dig> regarding na transport may be due to socompa lake sodium concentrations of  <dig> % are similar to the ones encountered in the sea, and therefore, there is no need for the novel salinivibrio strains to devote high energy and dna content in order to have to have a sophisticated na transport system. these results contradict the idea of primary sodium pumping as an adaptation to high external ph   <cit> .

genomic attributes related to osmoregulation
we found several genes related to osmotic stress in the genomes of the salinivibrio strains. the primary response to high-osmolarity stress is the uptake of potassium  <cit>  and the genes for potassium uptake proteins trka and trkh were present. the trk genes were dispersed in these genomes as in most bacteria studied thus far, with a few exceptions, like v. alginolyticus
 <cit> . moreover, it was reported that the trkh system requires trke, but here, trkah appears to be independent from of trke similarly as seen for v. alginolyticus
 <cit> . a secondary response to high environmental osmolarity is the replacement of the intracellular k+ by compatible solutes  <cit> . the genes for a high-affinity choline uptake protein , the l-proline glycine betaine abc transport system permease proteins , the glycine betaine transporter  and glycerol uptake facilitator protein  are present in all three novel strains. glycerol is prevalent as an osmolyte in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> , but polar noncharged solutes have not been identified as an osmolyte in bacteria or archaea  <cit> . it is possible that the glycerol uptake is linked to the glycerolipid metabolism according to our kegg metabolic analysis. also, we found in the novel strains the genes for choline dehydrogenase , and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase  responsible for the biosynthesis of betaine and genes for the l- <dig> -diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase , diaminobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase , aspartokinase  and l-ectoine synthase  responsible for the biosynthesis of ectoine, reinforcing the gene repertoire for the osmoregulation. some bacteria  are able to synthesize betaine by the enzymes beta and betb from choline  <cit> . ectoine is the major osmolyte in aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacteria  <cit> . it has also been found as the major solute in bacteria from the alkaline, hypersaline mono lake  <cit> , and also could be present in salinivibrios  <cit> . the presence of this gene repertoire in the novel salinivibrios suggests that these strains might be applying different strategies, such as the uptake of k+ and the biosynthesis of compatible solutes, to cope with the osmotic stress in socompa lake.

extremophilic hydrolytic enzymes and energy production
we found a diversity of genes coding for amylases, proteases, lipases and pullulanases in the genomes of the three novel strains that are related to enzymes that appear to function under broad ranges of salinity  and ph   <cit> . ortholog genes for the alpha-amylase were present in all strains  and had high identity to the alpha-amylase of the halolophilic halomonas meridiana
 <cit> . the proteases encoded in the genome of the sequenced strains presented >75% amino-acid identity to the one from salinivibrio proteolyticus with all orthologs belonging to the m <dig> family of metalloproteases. all proteins showed similarity  to metalloproteases from v. corallyliticus. since most of the zinc-metalloproteases that have been characterized so far are mainly active at neutral ph  <cit> , we suggest that the genomes of the three novel salinivibrio strains have evolved to adapt to the environmental conditions of the socompa.

ferredoxins and flavodoxins
we detected genes coding for ferredoxin , ferredoxin 2fe-2s  and ferredoxin 4fe-4s . ferredoxins are electron shuttles harboring iron–sulfur clusters that participate in oxido-reductive pathways in organisms displaying very different lifestyles. ferredoxin levels decline under environmental stress and iron starvation, whereas flavodoxins, being isofunctional proteins, are induced under these conditions and replace ferredoxin in most reactions  <cit> . more specifically, fd <dig> is involved in alanine biosynthesis, fe-s cluster assembly and, cytochrome reduction  <cit> . fd and fd <dig> electron carriers are involved in the inorganic sulfur assimilation  <cit> . the former is not present in the type strain s. costicola subsp. costicola atcc <dig>  the overrepresentation of ferredoxin genes for inorganic sulfur assimilation in the strains s10b, s <dig> and s <dig> suggests adaptation to the high concentrations of iron and sulfate contained in the socompa lake   <cit> . we found genes encoding flavodoxin- <dig> and flavodoxin- <dig> in the genome of all strains studied in this work, which may allow survival and reproduction under changing environmental conditions.

retinal-protein encoding genes
we identified proton-pumping rhodopsins encoding gene sequences in the genomes of three novel strains. proton-pumping rhodopsins are bacterial retinal-proteins that generate a proton gradient across the membrane, being utilized to drive an atpase and thus providing energy from light  <cit> . proton-pumping rhodopsins gene sequences from strains s10b , s <dig>  and s <dig>  had ≥ 99% of identity  between them. we observed the presence of the genes coding for the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase , the phytoene dehydrogenase , the phytoene synthase , the putative lycopene cyclase  and a predicted brp-like protein blh, in the flanking region of the rhodopsin genes. the isopentenyl diphosphate delta-isomerase gene  was presented, but located at distant from of the crt gene cluster. these enzymes are necessary for the β-carotene and the retinal biosynthesis from the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate through phytoene and lycopene intermediates . brp and blh are similar proteins that catalyze or regulate the conversion of β-carotene to retinal specifically  <cit> . based on an alignment of isolates putative rhodopsins with xanthorhodopsin  , proteorhodopsin  , bacteriorhodopsin  , we identified  <dig> residues conserved among the six proteins . the three novel strains had hypothetical protein sequences with the majority of functionally important residues known to play roles in retinal binding, proton transport and structural folding such as tyr- <dig>  arg- <dig>  asp- <dig>  trp- <dig>  trp- <dig>  tyr- <dig>  asp- <dig>  lys- <dig> and asp- <dig> in the sequence of the homologous bacteriorhodopsin  . in the case of the sequences from s10b and s <dig>  although, a threonine replaces asp- <dig>  a residue involved in the proton releasing from the schiff base to the external medium  <cit> . furthermore, the lysine residue binding the retinal chromophore  is not present, and the last helicoidal segment, the helix g, is missing  <cit> , suggesting that the sequences from these two strains  may represent new or not functional retinal proteins. because of the relatively high genome sequencing coverage we do not expect this fact to be due to sequencing errors  <cit> . we also found that the residue glu- <dig>  important for proton transport, is missing in the retinal protein sequences of s <dig>  s10b and s <dig>  however, rammelsberg et. al. reported that none of the residues involved are completely indispensable for the functioning of the proton pump  <cit> .

the retinal protein coding genes from the three novel salinivibrios were related to the xr gene from salinibacter ruber   <cit> . the retinal protein from s <dig> had 45% identity to xr . as in pr and xr, the internal proton donor homologous to asp- <dig> is glu  <cit> . seven transmembrane alpha helices were detected by phobius tool  <cit> , conserved aa residues above mentioned  <cit>  and a leu <dig> residue corresponding to the pr position  <dig> strongly suggested that putative protein xr  from s <dig> encodes a retinal-binding ion transporter protein that can create a proton gradient for atp production and is spectrally tuned to green light  <cit> . this characteristic is in accordance with the source of the isolated strains from shallow sites of the socompa lake.

on the other hand, the carotene ketolase gene  important for salinixantin and echinenone biosynthesis, both carotenoids light-harvesting antenna of xr are not present. furthermore, the amino acids involved with salinixantin binding in salinibacter xanthorhodopsin are replaced as follows: leu148182/val, gly156190/trp, phe-157191/val, thr160194/met, asn191227/ile, leu197233/ile, gly201237/leu, met208244/leu and met211247/leu . in fact, no carotenoids were isolated to explain the pink color of the strains. nonetheless, they are not necessary for a functional xr  <cit> . these characteristics, the organization of the corresponding gene clusters and the neighbor joining based phylogenetic reconstruction  confirmed that the rhodopsins of salinivibrios are the most distant part of the xr group called supgroup ii by vollmers et al.
 <cit> . the xrs most closely related to salinivibrios rhodopsins were the ones from marinobacter and spiribacter. the tree topology also showed that the exiguobacterium sp. s <dig> pr is only distantly related to the three novel salinivibrio strains, corroborating the idea that there is no relationship between the habitat and the rhodopsin type, contradicting proposed by vollmers et al.

moreover, the existence of proton-pumping rhodopsins in haal was already reported, but those sequences were more related to prs from freshwater and marine environments  <cit> . in the present study we disclosed, for the first time, xanthorhodopsins-like genes in haal and the unusual occurrence of such genes in salinivibrio. the presence of xr genes in the genomes of the three novel strains is an uncommon feature in salinivibrios that could possibly reflect the acquisition of these genes by horizontal gene transfer . these genes could improve the ecological fitness of the three novel salinivibrio strains that live in the socompa lake.

CONCLUSIONS
the phenotypic and genotypic plasticity observed in the three novel strains from socompa lake reflect their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. we disclose possible examples of horizontal gene transfer events, such as the unique phage genes in the stromatolite strain s10b, and reveal highly diverse dna photolyases homologs, indicating possible examples of gene duplication.

the novel salinivibrio strains appear to have evolved cellular mechanisms for energy production from light using rhodopsins possibly recruited from other types of bacteria. the phenotypic tests and the presence of genes related to arsenic resistance, dna repair, and osmoregulation reflect the ability of the novel strains to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. the high genomic similarity observed among the three novel salinivibrios also reflects the ample spatial distribution of this new taxon in different habitats  of the socompa lake. however, the high number of unique genes found in each of the salinivibrios, also suggests that each of the three novel strains represents different co-occurring populations within a new species, rather than a single clonal organism occurring in different habitats of the socompa lake. these niche-related genomic signatures are represented by genes such as the ones involved in cobalamine biosynthesis of s <dig> , and for capsular polysaccharide synthesizing enzyme in s <dig> , giving these strains properties to develop different roles in their respective habitat.
