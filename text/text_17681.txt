BACKGROUND
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  are ubiquitous environmental organic pollutants, deriving from natural or anthropogenic activities, especially from incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic material  <cit> . the annual pah emission in china was estimated up to  <dig>  tons in  <dig>  accounting for 29% of the global total  <cit> . due to their carcinogenicity and toxicity to both human and non-human organisms, pahs have been recognized as priority pollutants by the u.s. environmental protection agency  <cit> . dietary intake has been identified as the principal route of exposure to pahs for the non-smoking population, with plant-based foodstuffs constituting a major contributor to the total pah intake  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that over 20% of main crops contain pahs that exceed the relative control limit  in china  <cit> . therefore, it is important to find a way to reduce the uptake of pahs by crops for food safety.

it has been well documented that plant roots can take up pahs from soil or water contaminated with pahs  <cit> . however, the mechanism of pah uptake by plant roots is still not definitively understood. our previous work has demonstrated that pahs can enter the crop roots partly by passive transport and partly by active transport  <cit> . passive transport of pahs proceeds via aquaglyceroporins, and active transport is mediated by h+/pahs symporters  <cit> . the cotransport of pahs may be driven by a gradient of electrochemical potential for h+ across a membrane, which is generated and maintained by plasma membrane-bound atpase. evidence for symport of h+/pahs includes:  alkalinization of the medium during pah uptake;  transient depolarization of membrane in response to pah supply;  inhibition of pah uptake by metabolic inhibitors and atpase inhibitors; and  stimulation of pah uptake by low external ph  <cit> .

potassium  is classified as an essential macronutrient for all plants. it is the most abundant ion in plant cells and is required for a wide array of functions, such as maintenance of electrical potential gradients across cell membranes, generation of turgor, and activation of numerous enzymes  <cit> . hence, it is one of the major fertilizers frequently applied in agriculture.

it is well known that k+ uptake is characterized by biphasic uptake kinetics, a low-affinity transport system   and a high-affinity transport system    <cit> . at low external concentrations , the hats operates and catalyzes an inward flux, against an electrochemical gradient, by use of a k+/h+ symport mechanism  <cit> . by contrast, the lats dominates mostly via the activity of k+ channels at high external concentrations   <cit> . k+ uptake via hats or lats can trigger h+ efflux  <cit> , resulting in decrease in external medium ph  <cit> . whether h+ efflux associated with k+ uptake enhances the h+/pah symport process is unknown.

in this paper, we hypothesize that a k+ influx/h+ efflux reaction is coupled with the active uptake of pahs into the root cells. the objectives are 1) to determine the dependence of pah uptake upon k+ influx, and 2) to reveal the mechanism on k+-stimulated pah uptake. the investigation about the relationship of pah and k+ uptake is beneficial for regulating pah uptake by plant roots through decreased or increased k+ fertilizer application in crop food safety and enhanced phytoremediation of pah-contaminated soils or water. here, we provide for the first time, to our knowledge, strong evidence of coupling between h+/pah symport and k+ uptake.

RESULTS
effect of k+ on phenanthrene  uptake
to examine the effect of k+ on phe uptake by wheat roots, different levels of k+ were added to uptake solutions. figure  <dig> depicts the k+-dependent phe uptake. k+ noticeably enhanced phe uptake by roots of intact wheat seedlings in a nonlinear manner within k+ concentrations of 0–12 mmol l- <dig> . the enhancement was more obvious within k+ range of 0– <dig>  mmol l- <dig> with a rate  of  <dig>  as compared to that at higher k+ range of  <dig> -12 mmol l-1 k+ with a rate of  <dig> .

effect of k+ channel inhibitors on phe uptake
phe uptake in the presence and absence of tetraethlyammonium ion  and barium ion  is shown in figure  <dig>  although there existed slight fluctuation among the uptake data, the difference was not significant .

effect of phe and k+ uptake on membrane potential
the membrane of wheat root cells depolarized upon introduction of k+, phe, or both k+ and phe . this depolarization was only transient. depolarization recovered spontaneously while still in the presence of k+, phe, or both k+ and phe. when either k+ or phe, or both k+ and phe were removed from the medium after repolarization completed, the membrane was transiently hyperpolarized and gradually depolarized to values approximately equal to the initial ones . depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization and depolarization could be repeated three times with the same root when it was exposed to k+-, phe-, or k+ and phe-containing solutions and then to k+-, phe-, or k+ and phe-free solutions . the depolarization displayed as a function of k+ concentration. the higher k+ concentration, the higher membrane potential of root cells depolarized . the depolarization elicited by phe was stronger than by k+, and that induced by phe and k+ was greater than that by phe or k+.

activity of plasma membrane h+-atpase
to characterize the changes in activity of plasma membrane h+-atpase, the enzyme activity was determined at different k+ concentrations in the presence of  <dig>  μm phe. figure  <dig> shows that the activities of plasma membrane h+-atpase increased as k+ concentration increased within the test range of 0–12 mm. the activities increased dramatically at lower k+ concentrations up to  <dig>  mm; at higher k+ concentrations, the activities increased slowly without reaching saturation.

effect of k+ and phe uptake on external medium ph
the addition of phe caused a significant increase in solution ph  . the uptake of k+ markedly reduced solution ph , and the higher the k+ concentration, the lower the ph was. the ph values treated with k+ and phe were higher than those treated with k+ , but lower than that treated with phe .

discussion
to date, little information is available on the interaction between k+ and pah uptake into plant roots, and the mechanisms underlying k+-stimulated pah uptake remain unclear. generally, the interaction between k+ and phe uptake may proceed directly by transport pathways or indirectly by altering environmental factors such as external medium ph. if plants take up phe in the same transport ways as k+ , the presence of k+ would inhibit phe uptake. on the contrary, we have noticed that k+ stimulates phe transport into wheat roots , and the presence of k+ channels blockers  doesn’t repress phe uptake due to no significant difference in phe uptake by wheat roots between the treatments with and without tea+ or ba2+ . this means that phe influx into wheat roots doesn’t proceed via k+ transport ways.

it has been well addressed that k+ transport into plant roots triggers depolarization in membrane potential  <cit> . and, we have previously reported that a depolarization of membrane potential occurs upon addition of phe into basal solution, and phe is taken up by a phe/h+ symport system  <cit> . the similar phenomena are also found in our electrophysiological measurements . therefore, the combined treatment of phe and k+ leads to a greater depolarization of membrane potential, especially at higher k+ level. since the active transport for phe proceeds via a phe/h+ symport system, phe uptake causes h+ entrance into root cells, further triggering a depolarization in root cell membrane potential  <cit> . thus, more positive charges pass into root cells in the treatment with both phe and k+ than with phe or k+ only, and then a much greater depolarization of membrane potential occurs in the treatment with phe and k+. the subsequent repolarization in the presence of phe, k+ or both phe and k+ can be explained by increased activity of h+ efflux pump stimulated by the increased cytosolic h+ concentration  <cit> . the hyperpolarization upon withdrawal of phe, k+ or both phe and k+ may have been due to the cessation of the solute/h+ symport carrier or the closure of k+ channels while the h+-efflux pump still operates at an increased rate  <cit> .

the plant plasma membrane h+-atpase is very abundant in cells that are active in nutrient acquisition, and plays crucial roles in a number of essential physiological processes  <cit>  such as energization of nutrient uptake, phloem loading, opening of stomata, generation of the electrochemical gradient of h+ that provides the driving force for uptake of solutes through channel proteins and h+-coupled carriers  <cit> , as well as the regulation of extra- and intracellular ph. because plasma membrane h+-atpase can be stimulated by k+ <cit> , its activity increases with an increase in k+ concentrations as shown in our results . moreover, the pattern of changes in plasma membrane h+-atpase activity in response to increasing k+ concentrations is considerably similar to that in phe uptake . therefore it is likely that k+-stimulated phe uptake is indirectly coupled with an electrochemical h+ gradient established due to the activation of plasma membrane h+-atpase by k+ ions, i.e., a k+ influx/h+ efflux reaction is coupled with the active uptake of pahs into the root cells.

increase in k+ ions in the hydroponic solution induces a further depolarization of root cell membrane , and thus promotes the release of h+ into the external medium, causing a reduction in external medium ph . the results are in good line with those observed by sacchi et al.  <cit>  and du et al.  <cit> . at higher k+ concentrations, the channel-mediated influx predominates, causing a greater release of h+ in the external medium  <cit> . therefore, the external medium ph at 6 mm k+ is lower than that at  <dig>  mm k+ . due to an increase in external medium ph for the operation of the h+/phe symport system and a decrease in external medium ph for k+ uptake, the external medium ph in the presence of phe and k+ is much higher than that in the presence of k+ only . the changes in external medium ph during root uptake of phe with and without k+ further support our hypothesis that k+-stimulated phe uptake is coupled with h+ pump activated by k+. based on our results and the mechanism for k+ transport into plant root cells proposed by britto and kronzucker  <cit> , a model for interaction between k+ and phe uptake is proposed . in this model, the h+/phe symport system is associated with a k+ influx/h+ efflux reaction.

CONCLUSIONS
we have observed the interaction of phe and k+ uptake, and proposed a mechanistic model for the interaction. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the topic. the data presented here show that the phe uptake is dependent on the external medium k+ concentrations. the inhibitors for k+ channels have no effect on phe uptake. the presence of phe and k+ triggers a greater depolarization of root cell membrane as compared to that of phe or k+ only, resulting in a higher external medium ph. the activity of plasma membrane h+-atpase is activated by k+. therefore, the k+-enhanced uptake of phe is a result of a coupling of h+-phe symport into wheat roots and a k+ influx/h+ efflux reaction. our results provide a novel insight into the pah uptake by crop roots.
