BACKGROUND
genomic characteristics associated with the emergence or reemergence of pathogens in livestock operations can be subdivided into two categories;  genomic features that increase the adaptation to a host, or facilitate the jump to a new host species, or  genomic features that provide increased adaptation to environmental factors in the livestock environment, such as antibiotic resistance. comparative and population genomic studies are particularly suited to determine which features are responsible for the emergence of certain pathogens. for instance, price et al.  <cit>  showed that a putative host jump, from humans to livestock, in a clonal complex in staphylococcus aureus was associated with the loss of phage-carried human virulence genes and with the acquisition of tetracycline and methicillin resistance.

salmonella enterica is one of the most frequent causes of bacterial foodborne illness and death in the united states  <cit> . in salmonella, examples of emergent clones include s. typhimurium dt  <dig>  a multidrug resistant clone, which has seen a global epidemic spread from  <dig>  <cit> , and s. enterica serovar  <dig> ,12:i:–, a monophasic variant of s. typhimurium, which showed a global increase in the mid-1990s  <cit> . in this study, we present comparative and population genomic research on s. enterica subsp. enterica serovar cerro . s. cerro is rarely associated with human disease, with only one outbreak reported in the us so far that could be solely attributed to this serovar  <cit> ; an additional outbreak was recently reported and it was linked to multiple serovars, including s. cerro  <cit> . however, this salmonella serovar has emerged over the last decade as one of the most abundant salmonella serovars in cattle operations in the northeastern us  <cit> , including one of the most common serovars among subclinical dairy cattle and in the dairy farm environment  <cit>  in the northeastern united states. most of the s. cerro isolated from cattle and farms represent one pulsed field electrophoresis  type, indicating that a single clonal lineage is involved in this emergence  <cit> . it is unknown what causes s. cerro to be associated with cattle and why it is rarely involved in human disease. therefore, we hypothesize that s. cerro has distinct genomic characteristics that explain its association with cattle and limited association with human disease.

RESULTS
de novo assembly shows that s. cerro fsl r8- <dig> has a genome size of approximately  <dig>  mbp, contains six prophage regions and represents mlst sequence type st367
after exclusion of contigs fewer than 200 bp, the total length of the s. cerro fsl r8- <dig> draft de novo assembly was  <dig> ,817 bp. the assembly consisted of  <dig> contigs, with a contig n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, and a maximum contig length of  <dig>  bp. the average coverage depth of the assembly was 96x. one contig, contig  <dig>  contained genes of an inci1-like plasmid, however it is unclear whether this is an integrated or extrachromosomal plasmid. in addition to genes involved in plasmid transfer, stability and replication, this plasmid also carries genes encoding a resistance nodulation division  efflux pump  <cit> . however, none of the isolates sequenced in this study showed resistance to single or multiple antimicrobial agents. no evidence for the existence of additional plasmids within the genome was found. this may be at least partially due to the presence of a dna phosphorothioation-dependent restriction modification  system in all s. cerro strains examined in this study. while this rm system has been well characterized in s. cerro  <cit> , a psi-blast search reveals this type of rm system is very rare among salmonella, and only found in a limited number of sequenced salmonella strains of serovars saintpaul , namur  and panama .

prediction of lysogenic prophages and prophage remnants in the s. cerro fsl r8- <dig> genome was performed using prophinder  <cit> . six putative prophages or remnants of prophages, ranging in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, were predicted to be present in the s. cerro fsl r8- <dig> genome . the six prophage regions, which we refer to as prophage  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were compared, using rast  <cit> , to previously sequenced genomes to identify homologous regions. prophages  <dig> and  <dig>  are similar in composition to a s. typhimurium es18-like bacteriophage, while  <dig> shows similarity to an enterobacteria p22-like prophage. while typical salmonella-associated prophages, such as gifsy- <dig>  gifsy- <dig>  fels- <dig>  and fels- <dig>  were not predicted to be present in the s. cerro fsl r8- <dig> genome, prophage  <dig> shared many genes with a prophage found in photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tt <dig>  which has been described as a successful insect pathogen as well as symbiont of soil entomopathogenic nematodes  <cit> .table  <dig>

genome assembly based multi locus sequence typing  was performed using the online tool  <cit>  of the center for genomic epidemiology  and an additional blastn search. this analysis revealed that s. cerro fsl r8- <dig> belongs to sequence type   <dig>  according to the salmonella mlst database  st <dig> is associated with a s. cerro isolate from a human case in germany in  <dig>  the database also contains an accession of the type strain of s. cerro, isolated from swine in  <dig> in uruguay. this strain belongs to st <dig> and displays a different allelic type at each of the seven mlst loci. s. cerro therefore is very likely to be polyphyletic, which makes interpretation of historical references without genomic or mlst sequence data difficult. because all isolates sequenced in this study belong to st <dig>  we will refer to these isolates as s. cerro st <dig> from here on. timme et al.  <cit>  recently published sequence data for another s. cerro st <dig> strain ; this group showed that, among all serovars that have been sequenced so far, s. adelaide fsl a4- <dig> is most closely related to s. cerro st <dig> which is consistent with our study .

population genomic analysis of 27 salmonella serovar cerro isolates suggests a recent clonal expansion of a bovine-associated s. cerro lineage
to infer whether the s. cerro isolates associated with bovine hosts and cattle-associated environments form separate subpopulations from s. cerro isolated from other sources, we obtained whole genome sequencing data for  <dig> additional isolates . after removal of putative recombinogenic regions, as identified by bratnextgen  <cit> , and snps that were present in fewer than 90% of the isolates,  <dig> snps were left for analysis. to assess the presence of a temporal signal in the dataset, a path-o-gen  analysis was performed using a maximum likelihood tree inferred from the snp data set. this analysis showed a correlation  between the time of isolation of the individual isolates and the root-to-tip divergence, indicating a temporal signal for this dataset and justifying a molecular clock based phylogenetic analysis. a bayesian analysis, assuming a relaxed molecular clock and a constant population size, inferred the mean mutation rate for the core genome of the 27 s. cerro isolates to be  <dig>  × 10−7/site/year   <dig>  × 10− <dig> –  <dig>  × 10−7). this mutation rate is comparable to mutation rates estimated for buchnera aphidicola <cit>  and helicobacter pylori <cit> , but about twice as fast as recently inferred for s. agona  <cit> . the new york bovine isolates are found in a well-supported  clade , well separated from the isolates from washington state, florida, and the human clinical isolates from new york state. this may indicate that, although isolates of s. cerro of the bovine-associated clade were prevalent in farm environments, and thus farm personnel would be frequently exposed to this clone, this clone was not responsible for the human cases in new york state represented by these two isolates. the time of the emergence of the most recent ancestor  of the ny bovine clade is estimated to be  <dig> . the ny bovine clade is further split up into two clades:  a clade with two isolates from northeastern new york  and  a clade with  <dig> bovine associated isolates from western ny state . the mrca of the latter clade dates back to  <dig> . within clade  <dig>  two well supported clusters were identified . specifically, ‘cluster a’ contains six isolates that were isolated from steuben county  and the neighboring livingston county . this finding suggests a phylogeographic signal in the dataset, which should facilitate more detailed tracing of the emergence of s. cerro st <dig> throughout the northeastern us with a larger sampling and a population genomic analysis.table  <dig>

genome sequence analysis reveals a stepwise evolution, of s. cerro st <dig> to a bovine-associated clade, characterized by deletion of selected operons and acquisition of a premature stop codon in sopa
loss or gain of genes within bacterial populations may indicate niche adaption of bacterial subpopulations  <cit> . to infer patterns of gene loss, we mapped reads of the 27 s. cerro isolates against well-annotated genomes such as those of s. typhimurium lt <dig>  s. typhi ct <dig>  and s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  in addition we mapped the reads of s. adelaide fsl a4- <dig>  <cit>  against these genomes, to determine if the patterns of absence were also observed in the most recent common ancestor of this serovar and the s. cerro population studied here. reads of the 27 s. cerro isolates mapped to  <dig>   <dig>  and 90% of the coding sequences in s. typhi ct <dig>  s. typhimurium lt <dig>  and s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  respectively. this is very similar to the percentage of genes shared  between s. typhimurium lt <dig> and s. typhi ct <dig>  <cit>  and falls in the higher end of the range observed by jacobsen et al.  <cit>  for a wide variety of salmonella serovars. the genome size, and the high number of shared genes thus suggest that the lineage of s. cerro studied here did not experience notable genome reduction.

mapping of sequence reads of the isolates of the s. cerro population further revealed a pattern of gene absence generally conserved within the s. cerro population sampled here, suggesting that most of the genomic characteristics associated with the emergence of s. cerro among bovine-associated habitats were present in the mrca of this s. cerro clade. interestingly, loss of some spis  that were found here to be absent or partially absent  from the cerro population studied , but are present in s. typhimurium lt <dig> or s. typhi ct <dig>  have been associated with attenuation of virulence. specifically, the genomic island at s. typhi spi- <dig> locus is completely absent from the s. cerro st <dig> isolates examined here; this spi has been associated with virulence in mice  <cit> . chaudhuri et al.  <cit>  also showed that significant reduction of fitness of s. typhimurium sl <dig> is observed during intestinal colonization of cattle when genes in spi- <dig>  are disrupted by transposon insertion. genes homologous to  stm <dig> c to stm <dig> of spi- <dig>  and  stm <dig>  stm <dig>  and stm <dig> to stm <dig> of spi- <dig> were also found to be absent from s. cerro st367; these spis have been associated with systemic infection of mice in s. typhimurium  <cit> , and replication in macrophages . furthermore, disruption of stm <dig> in spi- <dig> and stm <dig> in spi- <dig> was previously shown to cause significant reduction in fitness in s. typhimurium sl <dig> during intestinal colonization of cattle  <cit> . in addition, homologs of stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig> are deleted in s. cerro st <dig>  these genes are found in spi- <dig>  a spi associated with intestinal persistence in mice  <cit> . disruption of stm <dig> in s. typhimurium has been shown to cause reduced fitness with regard to intestinal colonization of cattle  <cit> . most of the spi-related genes found to be absent in s. cerro st <dig> were confirmed to be present in s. adelaide fsl a4- <dig>  suggesting loss of these genes/spis occurred after the divergence of s. adelaide from the most recent common ancestor of s. cerro st <dig>  we found evidence for the presence of four complete toxin-antitoxin  modules  within the s. cerro genomes studied here. this is interesting as de la cruz et al.  <cit>  suggested that ta modules in salmonella play a role in virulence, and that the number of genomically encoded ta modules is correlated with pathogenicity of individual strains. by comparison, the number of ta modules in s. enterica subsp. enterica ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> , making s. cerro st <dig> one of the subsp. enterica serotypes with the lowest number of ta modules. the number of ta modules in s. cerro st <dig> is similar to that observed in salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae, a subspecies which is predominantly found in cold blooded hosts and does generally not seem to cause illness in warm blooded hosts  <cit> . complete or partial absence of some spis in all s. cerro st <dig> and the low number of ta modules in the genome, thus suggests a putative shift of s. cerro in host and/or tissue tropism before the emergence of the ny bovine-associated clade.

the hypothesis that the s. cerro population studied here shows unique host and/or tissue tropism characteristics is also supported by the finding that all  <dig> s. cerro st <dig> isolates sequenced here were found to carry a premature stop codon in sopa, causing a truncation of the gene from  <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa. previous studies have shown that sopa is involved in virulence during bovine gastrointestinal infections by s. typhimurium and s. dublin  <cit> , and that sopa mutations are implicated in reduced polymorphonuclear  cell migration  <cit> , and fluid secretion in ileal loops in calves  <cit> . premature stop codons in sopa have been found in s. typhi, s. paratyphi a, and s. gallinarum and it has been suggested that loss of a functional sopa has been an important factor in the virulence and adaptation of these serovars to a systemic niche in certain hosts  <cit> .

interestingly, the one base-pair insertion responsible for the premature stop codon occurs within a ~10 bp region of sopa that also contains deletions in s. typhi and s. paratyphi a . while s. typhi and s. paratyphi a contain additional mutations that may have caused loss of function of sopa  <cit> , the occurrence of deletions in the same region in s. cerro sopa suggests this is a replication error prone region in the genome. a conserved domain search  against the conserved domain database  <cit>  of the aa sequence of the truncated sopa in s. cerro st <dig> revealed the premature stop is situated in the sopa central domain  <cit>  of the gene. furthermore, the truncated sopa protein lacks the capsase- <dig> cleavage sites, which have been demonstrated to be important in induction of pmn transepithelial migration in s. typhimurium  <cit> . although specifically the disruption of the main functional domain in sopa and the loss of the capsase- <dig> cleavage sites suggest loss of function of sopa in s. cerro st <dig>  further molecular genetic experiments have to be conducted to reveal if truncation of sopa in s. cerro st <dig> has lead to loss of function of this gene, and how it affects host cell invasion  and other sopa associated aspects of salmonella virulence.figure  <dig>

read mapping also showed one gene cluster to be stepwise deleted in the ny bovine clade . this gene cluster contains homologs of the s. typhimurium lt <dig> genes stm <dig> to stm <dig>  this gene cluster encodes a d-alanine transporter and has been recently shown to be required for intracellular survival in murine macrophage-like cells  <cit> , and disruption of stm <dig> has been shown to cause a significant reduction in fitness in intestinal colonization in cattle in s. typhimurium  <cit> . this gene cluster is present in all  <dig> cerro st <dig> isolates that do not belong to the bovine clade. two isolates  lack two genes  in this gene cluster. these two isolates represent a clade that split off early from the remaining ny bovine-associated-population. the remaining  <dig> isolates in this clade lack the entire gene cluster . the  absence of the d-alanine transporter gene cluster is currently the only genomic feature that differentiates the ny bovine clade from the remaining population .

s. cerro displays reduced invasiveness of human epithelial cells compared to other salmonella serovars commonly isolated from bovine sources
the comparative genomic analyses described above suggest s. cerro lacks several functional genes and genomic elements that are involved in invasion and intracellular survival. to assess if strains of s. cerro st <dig> population  studied here are impaired in their ability to invade human intestinal epithelial cells, caco- <dig> cells were infected with s. typhimurium , s. newport , s. kentucky , and s. cerro . each serovar was represented by one isolate each from a bovine clinical case, a subclinically infected bovine host, an environmental sample and a human clinical case. s. cerro isolates were significantly less invasive than isolates of serovars typhimurium  and newport , but not significantly different from s. kentucky  . however, the overall invasiveness of s. kentucky seems to be skewed by the presence of one isolate from a human clinical case, which shows very low invasion. when this outlier is excluded from the analysis, the s. cerro isolates are also significantly less invasive than s. kentucky . thus, consistent with our genomic analyses, s. cerro st <dig> seems to be less invasive in human intestinal epithelial cells than the serovars examined here. future studies on the ability of s. cerro to invade bovine intestinal epithelial cells and to cause illness in cattle will be necessary though to determine whether s. cerro or specific subtypes within s. cerro truly show attenuated bovine virulence.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomic analyses of 27 salmonella cerro isolates indicate that this serovar lacks several genes that have previously been shown to be involved in the ability of salmonella serovars to cause intestinal infection. reduced invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells, as compared to other serovars, further supports the reduced ability of this serovar to cause intestinal infection, however, further experiments are necessary to determine which genes are responsible for this phenotype. altogether, these results suggest that the emergence of s. cerro st <dig> among livestock operations in the northeastern united states may not be due to increased adaptation to the bovine host, nor to increased antibiotic resistance. instead, the frequent isolation of this serovar on cattle farms  <cit>  may reflect that this serovar was able to disperse rapidly as no efforts were undertaken to control its spread . alternatively, or in addition, s. cerro  may have unique phenotypic characteristics that were not discovered through the comparative genomic analyses conducted here, but that facilitate environmental survival or dispersal.
