BACKGROUND
neurotensin  is a peptide originally isolated from bovine hypothalamus  <cit> . it is found in the cns and gastrointestinal tract. in the cns, nt acts as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator and one of its better known actions is to modulate dopaminergic transmission within the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways  <cit> . in addition, a number of studies suggest that nt may be implicated in the pathophysiology of cns disorders including schizophrenia, parkinson's disease and drug abuse  <cit> .

considerable efforts have been made to characterize how nt acts to enhance dopamine  release. when applied to the ventral tegmental area , nt increases the firing rate of da neurons and da release in terminal fields of the nucleus accumbens  and the prefrontal cortex <cit> . moreover, acute microinjection of nt into the vta enhances motor activity and facilitates da-dependent behaviors <cit> . at a mechanistic level, recent work has established that somatodendritic nt receptors enhance the firing rate of da neurons through a ca2+-dependent mechanism  <cit> .

at the terminal level, nt also acts to enhance da release. first, anatomical evidence for a presynaptic localization of nt receptors has been provided  <cit> . second, nt facilitates k+-evoked and electrically-evoked da release in dorsal striatal slice preparations  <cit>  as well as in dorsal striatum in vivo  <cit> . these results support a presynaptic effect of nt on da neuron axon terminals, but previous studies have not identified the mechanism involved or excluded an indirect mechanism of action. recent work studying glutamate cotransmission in cultured da neurons failed to provide support for a direct excitatory effect of nt on axon terminals  <cit> . in addition, a previous preliminary report failed to detect an enhancement of da release evoked by single electrical pulses in nacc slices  <cit> . thus, the mechanism of action of nt on dopaminergic axon terminals remains unclear.

in the present study, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry  to better characterize the presynaptic action of nt in the nacc. we find that although nt fails to increase da release evoked by single pulses, it strongly enhances da release evoked by pulse trains that lead to prolonged da release and engage d <dig> autoreceptors. our results suggest that nt acts to enhance da release by inhibiting the function of terminal d <dig> autoreceptors.

RESULTS
time course of da overflow evoked by single-pulses and train-pulses in the nucleus accumbens
fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to monitor da release at high time resolution in the shell and core/shell border region of sprague-dawley rat nacc slices. we recorded da overflow following single-pulse  and in response to train-pulse stimulations , a frequency that can occur during bursting in vivo . the released substance was identified as da since the oxidation currents recorded corresponded to the peak oxidation potential for da  . with train stimulation, da concentrations peaked at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . da concentrations rose to a maximum within ~ <dig> ms . the return to baseline was reached approximately  <dig> seconds after the peak signal and the signal width at half-height was ~ <dig>  s . with single-pulse stimulation, da levels reached a peak at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . da concentrations rose to their maximum within ~ <dig> ms . the return to baseline was observed approximately one second after the peak and the signal width at half-height was ~ <dig>  s . a significant difference was detected between the two stimulation conditions for the peak da levels reached . as expected, the release of da evoked by electrical stimulation of the nacc was blocked by ttx   and was thus action potential-dependent, as well as by the removal of extracellular calcium  .

nt facilitates da overflow evoked by train-pulses but not by single-pulses
we next evaluated the effect of nt on electrically-evoked da overflow in the nacc. using single electrical pulses, we found that at a saturating concentration  <cit> , nt   failed to alter da overflow , suggesting that da release is not directly facilitated by nt . in sharp contrast, using train-pulse stimulation, nt significantly enhanced peak da overflow to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of control  . the facilitatory effect started to decline before the end of the period of agonist application: da concentrations recorded after  <dig> min of nt application were lower than after  <dig> min . this observation is compatible with the known ability of type  <dig> nt receptors  to desensitize in response to sustained stimulation  <cit> . in accordance with this, the preferential ntr <dig> antagonist sr <dig>  completely prevented the facilitatory effect of nt  .

nt enhances da release through inhibition of d <dig> autoreceptor function
previous work has suggested that nt may decrease terminal d <dig> receptor function  <cit> . one interpretation of the ability of nt to facilitate train-evoked but not single pulse-evoked da overflow is therefore that nt acts principally by inhibiting the function of terminal d <dig> autoreceptors. this would imply that contrarily to train stimulation, d <dig> autoreceptors are usually not activated in response to single pulse stimulation, as was previously demonstrated  <cit> . to evaluate this hypothesis under our conditions, we next quantified evoked da overflow using selective agonists and antagonists of the d <dig> autoreceptor. the d <dig> receptor agonist quinpirole  decreased pulse train-evoked da overflow to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of control   and single pulse-evoked da overflow to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of control  . in contrast, the d <dig> receptor antagonist sulpiride  enhanced da release triggered by pulse trains  , but had no effect on da overflow evoked in response to single pulses  .

we next tested whether nt still increased da overflow following d <dig> receptor blockade. we first applied sulpiride  alone and found that it increased da levels to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of control values  . with sulpiride present in the bath, nt   produced only a minor additional increase in da levels , thus reflecting an almost complete block of the facilitating effect of nt . a one-way anova with post hoc tukey tests revealed a significant difference between control and these two conditions  . a specific comparison of the enhancement of da overflow by nt in the presence of sulpiride  or in its absence  shows that the effect of nt was strongly decreased under autoreceptor blockade . these results suggest that the majority of the facilitatory effect of nt on da release is mediated through inhibition of d <dig> autoreceptor function.

releasable pools of da are not depleted in the presence of sulpiride
pulse trains generate considerable da release in the nacc brain slice in the presence of sulpiride . the blockade by sulpiride of the ability of nt to facilitate da release could thus in principle be an artefact resulting from a ceiling effect due to depletion of the releasable pools of da or to the inability to further increase release probability. to test this possibility, we pre-applied sulpiride  and then introduced a modified acsf containing an elevated concentration of calcium . sulpiride first increased da overflow to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of control levels  . elevation of extracellular ca2+ to  <dig>  mm in the presence of sulpiride produced an additional increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of control  . a one-way anova followed by a post hoc tukey test confirmed significant differences between the control, sulpiride and  <dig>  mm ca2+ conditions . the maximal da release detected with sulpiride and elevated ca2+ exceeded  <dig>  μm. thus, the blockade by sulpiride of the ability of nt to facilitate da release is not likely to simply result from a depletion of releasable pools of da or to an inability to further increase release probability.

discussion
although multiple aspects of the action of nt at the cell body level in the vta have been investigated  <cit> , the mechanism of action of nt on dopaminergic axon terminals is still unclear. the present results provide new insight into the mechanism mediating the facilitation of da release by nt at the level of axon terminals in the nacc. we show that this mechanism implicates a decrease by nt of the effectiveness of terminal d <dig> autoreceptors that normally inhibit da release. we also demonstrate that the effects of nt on da release differ greatly depending on the electrical stimulation parameters used to elicit this release. on the one hand, nt fails to alter da overflow triggered by single pulses in the nacc. on the other hand, nt strongly enhances da release evoked by pulse trains that generate prolonged da release and strongly engage d <dig> autoreceptors.

an indirect mechanism can be discounted
nt is known to facilitate k+ and electrically-evoked da release in dorsal striatal slice preparations  <cit>  as well as in vivo  <cit> . although these observations imply a presynaptic effect of nt on dopaminergic axon terminals, previous results have not excluded an indirect mechanism of action. for example, nt could act through receptors located in the striatum on other elements than dopaminergic axon terminals. these receptors could for instance be located on corticostriatal glutamatergic axon terminals. if this were the case, nt could facilitate the spontaneous release of glutamate, which would then enhance da release by depolarizing dopaminergic axon terminals. although we cannot formally exclude this possibility or other possible indirect mechanisms, a major role for glutamate in mediating the ability of nt to enhance train-evoked da overflow is not easily reconcilable with our observation that this facilitatory effect of nt is blocked in the presence of the d <dig> antagonist sulpiride. however, we cannot exclude a possible partial implication of postsynaptic d <dig> receptors located on nacc medium spiny neurons, through some retrograde signaling mechanism.

action of nt on axon terminals
previous experiments have explored the characteristics of da d <dig> autoreceptors under different stimulation conditions varying the pulse/train duration or interpulse intervals, but didn't directly address the issue of the control of da release by nt at the terminal level  <cit> . nonetheless, a previous preliminary report showed that nt fails to enhance da release evoked by single electrical pulses in nacc slices  <cit> , and suggested that da release is not directly facilitated by nt. this previous report is consistent with our observation of an apparent lack of effect of nt on da overflow evoked by single pulses. although this finding could be taken as arguing against a role of terminal nt receptors in regulating da release, our findings using train pulse-evoked release shed light on this paradox by showing that nt acts instead to enhance da release by inhibiting the function of terminal d <dig> autoreceptors. our results support a recent report in which the authors monitored glutamate co-release in cultured da neurons and found that nt does not directly increase glutamate release, but rather attenuates the function of presynaptic d <dig> receptors that otherwise inhibit glutamate release  <cit> .

two of our present findings argue in favor of the hypothesis that nt mainly acts to enhance da release by inhibiting the function of terminal d <dig> autoreceptors. first, we show that only pulse train-evoked da overflow is facilitated by nt. this observation is compatible with previous reports showing that a minimum of 150– <dig> milliseconds is required for d <dig> autoreceptor activation to inhibit da release, conditions that are satisfied during train stimulation, but are not optimal to inhibit release induced by single short pulses  <cit> . in our experiments, the lack of facilitation by sulpiride of single-pulse evoked da overflow is in favor of this interpretation. second, we demonstrate that the facilitating effect of nt on pulse train-evoked da overflow is almost completely prevented by pre-blockade of d <dig> receptors. an alternate interpretation of this later finding is that in the presence of sulpiride, the releasable pools of da become depleted during stimulus trains or the release probability cannot be further increased, thus masking any subsequent facilitating effect of nt. considering our observation that elevating extracellular ca2+ strongly enhances da overflow after pre-application of sulpiride, this hypothesis of a ceiling effect is unlikely. nonetheless, we cannot completely exclude that releasable pools of da are modified in elevated extracellular ca2+. alternate explanations of the ability of d <dig> receptor blockade to prevent the facilitating effect of nt on da release thus cannot completely be discounted.

together, our results thus suggest that in the nacc, nt acts mainly by inhibiting the function of terminal d <dig> autoreceptors, leaving room for only a minor contribution of an additional mechanism. although this second mechanism is presently unidentified, the capacity of nt receptors to mobilize intracellular ca2+ in da neurons  <cit>  leaves opens the possible implication of a ca2+-dependent priming of synaptic vesicles. although we have not directly examined the dorsal striatum in the present experiments, our results are compatible with previous biochemical and in vivo microdialysis work also suggesting that nt acts to inhibit the function of terminal d <dig> autoreceptors in the dorsal striatum  <cit> .

in the present study, we found that the preferential ntr <dig> antagonist sr <dig> prevented the facilitatory effect of nt on train-evoked da overflow. although we cannot exclude a partial contribution of the type  <dig> nt receptor , our finding is compatible with previous data showing that da neurons of the vta and substantia nigra express abundant levels of ntr <dig>  <cit> , but only modest amounts of ntr <dig>  <cit> . second, the excitatory effects of nt on da neurons are maintained in ntr <dig> knockout mice but strongly decreased in ntr <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . compatible with this, sr <dig> has been shown to block the ability of nt to increase the firing rate of da neurons in culture  <cit> . finally, sr <dig> blocks the ability of nt to reduce the effect of the d <dig> agonist pergolide on extracellular da levels in the striatum in microdialysis experiments  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of nt on dopaminergic axon terminals. we suggest that nt through its type  <dig> receptor enhances da release mainly by inhibiting the function of d2-type autoreceptors, thus disinhibiting da release. future experiments should be oriented toward identifying the specific mechanism involved, such as heterologous desensitization of the d <dig> autoreceptor by ntr <dig> or direct receptor-receptor interactions.
