BACKGROUND
arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid, abundant in the earth's crust and a component of more than  <dig> minerals  <cit> . exposure to arsenic has been associated with cancers of the liver, bladder, skin and lung  <cit> . epidemiological studies in taiwan, bangladesh and india have reported adverse health effects associated with chronic arsenic exposure including; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, hypertension and ischeamic heart disease  <cit> . the risk of developing serious diseases from chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water prompted the us environmental protection agency  to lower the maximum contamination level  for arsenic in drinking water to  <dig> ppb  <cit> .

there are two biologically important arsenic valence states: arsenite  <dig>  iasiii) and arsenate  <dig>  iasv). inorganic arsenic in water is largely in the form of arsenate; it is negatively charged at physiological ph and slowly taken up by cells  <cit> . arsenate is rapidly converted to arsenite in vivo  <cit>  which is taken up by cells much more quickly than arsenate  <cit> . methylation of arsenicals facilitates their excretion from the cell and therefore was long considered a detoxification process, but recent evidence indicates that monomethylated  and dimethylated  arsenicals have many toxic effects including increased oxidative stress  <cit> , chromosomal aberrations , and oxidative dna damage  <cit> . in hepatocytes, trivalent monomethylated arsenicals  inhibit the activity of thioredoxin reductase , which is a critical antioxidant enzyme controlling the cellular redox balance  <cit> .

uptake and efflux of arsenicals occur primarily through transporter proteins. uptake of iasiii in hepatocytes and efflux of mmaiii to blood take place through aquaporin isozymes  <dig> , a family of membrane-spanning proteins that facilitate movement of solutes down their concentration gradient. aqp <dig> channels are expressed at high concentrations in liver cells and have been shown to transport iasiii when expressed both in saccharomyces cerevisiae  and in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . another class of transmembrane proteins facilitating the transport of iasiii and mmaiii across the cellular membrane of hepatocytes is glucose transporters and especially glut <dig> which is highly expressed in the liver  <cit> . glutathione conjugated arsenicals are exported to the extracellular space via multidrug resistant proteins  and multidrug resistant p-glycoproteins which are atp-binding cassette  transporters that export solutes against their concentration gradient  <cit> .

methylation of inorganic arsenic takes place primarily in the liver and specifically in hepatocytes via enzymatic catalysis by arsenic methyltransferase , previously known as cyt <dig>  producing both mono- and dimethylated arsenicals  <cit> . two biochemical pathways have been proposed for methylation of arsenates with a key difference in the substrate for as3mt methylation:  a classical process of alternating steps of reduction and oxidative methylation where iasiii and mmaiii are the substrates and the methylation can happen in the presence or absence of gsh  <cit>  and  a process of gsh conjugation and reductive methylation where thiol-bound arsenicals  are the substrates  <cit> . gsh has a stimulatory role in both methylation pathways either as a reductant or in direct conjugation with arsenicals  <cit> .

arsenic activates the redox sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor -e2- related factor  <dig>  causing its increased nuclear translocation and nrf <dig> binding to the antioxidant response element   <cit> . arsenic activates nrf <dig> in a different manner when compared to other compounds such as sulforaphane  and tert-butylhydroquinone  enhancing the interaction of specific subunits of the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase  <cit> . it has been suggested that hepatocytes exhibit an "on-switch" antioxidant behavior when exposed to increasing arsenic doses  <cit> , possibly a result of this nrf <dig> activation.

in this study, a cellular-level semi-mechanistic tk model was developed for predicting intra-cellular concentrations of different arsenicals  in hepatocytes. currently, the only published cellular-level tk model for the uptake, biotransformation and efflux of arsenicals is the easterling et al.  <cit>  model schematically shown in figure 1; they demonstrated the relative importance of transport processes affecting the accumulation of arsenicals in rat hepatocytes  <cit> . however, a tk model for humans is needed since the inherent variation of arsenic metabolic capacity across various organisms complicates the extrapolation of rat tk model to humans. therefore, the mathematical model presented here was developed for humans and parameterized based on data from human hepatocytes.

methods
the human tk model applies mass action kinetics in order to predict the concentrations of trivalent and pentavalent arsenicals including arsenite , monomethylated , and dimethylated arsenicals  in human hepatocytes. this tk model takes into account processes such as influx, efflux, methylation, oxidation and glutathione conjugation of arsenicals. moreover, it accounts for induced cellular antioxidant response due to arsenic exposure through a "switch-like" mechanism that alters the model response above a specific threshold concentration  <cit> .

this model has been compared with the easterling et al. model  <cit>  , in terms of the ability to fit to data of arsenic retention and methylation in human hepatocytes. this comparison aims to highlight the advantages of developing biologically relevant tk models based on data acquired from human cells. further comparison of these two models in terms of their estimated parameter values aim to study the major intracellular kinetic processes that contribute to the differences in metabolism between humans and rats.

model development
the semi-mechanistic tk model describes arsenic transport across the cellular membrane and arsenic metabolism in hepatocytes according to the metabolic reaction cascade proposed by hayakawa et al.  <cit>  . figure  <dig> presents a schematic depiction of the constituents of the tk model that are also explained in table  <dig>  these constituents include chemical species and enzymes, and the interactions among them. fundamental assumptions made in the formulation of the tk model are:

1) arsenite influx across the cellular membrane pores is governed by their electrochemical potential, and can be described through an ion channel conductance-based formulation.

2) the oxidative stress mediated response of hepatocytes to arsenite exposure exhibits a "switch-like" behavior, and the upregulation of enzyme activities can be described through an approximate step function at a threshold concentration.

3) the methylation reactions are influenced by cooperativity phenomena as well as substrate inhibition, and can be described through a hybrid approach of hill and michaelis-menten kinetics.

4) the gsh-bound hydrolysis and clearance of methylated arsenicals exhibit a threshold-dependent behavior, and can be described using a sigmoidal function.

5) concentrations of arsenicals are uniform within the hepatocytes as well as the extracellular medium

6) all hepatocytes in the system have identical properties, are uniformly distributed in the medium, and are exposed to the same extracellular concentrations of arsenicals.

uptake of arsenite by hepatocytes via aqp9s  <cit>  is governed by their electrochemical potential across the cellular membrane . the conductance-based formulation for ion channels proposed in the hodgkin-huxley model  <cit>  is used here to describe the regulation of arsenite flux by aqp9s . specifically, the inactivation of aqp <dig> subunit gates during iasiii influx is described by equation 1b, which expresses the increased probability of these gates closing as more transport across the gates occurs.   

  aqp9=    

where, kinf represents the mass transfer coefficient for influx of arsenite in hepatocytes; katgint represents the rate constant for arsenite conjugation with gsh to form atg catalyzed by the glutathione s-transferase  family of enzymes; kiasiiiint is the rate constant for hydrolysis of atg ; kss is the steady state rate constant for efflux of arsenite that is attained at long time periods; k <dig> is the rate constant describing the basal activity of aqp9; and τe is the time constant governing the regulation of aqp <dig> gates.

thioredoxin  reductase  is the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of trx. trx is a critical antioxidant protein and an important reductant in the methylation of arsenic by as3mt  <cit> . the inactivation of tr by mmaiii leads to signals that account for two different phenomena: the induction of gsh and abc transporters via a redox sensitive activation of the cellular antioxidant response nrf <dig> nuclear receptor pathway  <cit>  and the decreased methylation capacity of as3mt. in this study the main focus is on mrps as an efflux mechanism of arsenicals since it has been reported that they are regulated by nrf <dig>  <cit> . the inactivation is modeled using principles of indirect response model theory  <cit>  via the threshold-dependent parameter:s=init−thresholdthreshold. parameter s depends on the initial exposure concentration of arsenite, init and a threshold concentration. the value of s is zero when arsenite doses are below the threshold concentration, and gradually increases with greater arsenite doses. the following equations describe this reaction cascade:

  dtrdt=ktr×−strc  ×ktrinact×htr 

  htr=nn+n 

  dgshdt=kgin×1tr−kgdeg×gsh 

  kgdeg=kgintr <dig> 

  dmrpdt=kmin×1tr−kmdeg×mrp 

  kmdeg=kmintr <dig> 

  das3mtdt=kain×tr−kadec×as3mt 

  kadec=kain×tr <dig> 

where, ktr is the first-order rate constant controlling the activity of tr; tr <dig> is the baseline activity value of tr; ktrinact is the first-order rate constant for tr inactivation; trc is a dimensionless inactivation constant; n is the hill coefficient for enzyme inactivation from mmaiii; kgin, kmin and kain are the rate constants governing of the activities of gsh, mrp and as3mt, kgdeg, kmdeg and kadec are the corresponding first-order decay constants.

methylation reactions of arsenic in the liver have been modeled in published cellular-level and whole-body pbtk models with classical michaelis-menten kinetics  <cit> . alternatives include cooperativity models such as the classical hill-type formulation and the more mechanistic monod-wyman-changeux  model  <cit> . in preliminary analyses, these formulations were unable to explain the time course patterns of arsenic retention and methylation in human hepatocytes . therefore, an alternative, non-classical formulation was used in the tk model. in this model, the as3mt is assumed to exhibit cooperativity and the methylation reaction rate is assumed to exhibit hysteretic sigmoidal behavior as per frieden  <cit> . in this formulation, the cooperativity is described by a hill-type formulation for vmax that is dependent on the total atg present in the system. the formulation accounts for the constitutive influence of gsh in the methylation reaction cascade and its role in the increase of vmax. moreover this hill-type formulation for vmax accounts for a possible colocalization of thiol-containing proteins that interact with gsh , mrps and as3mt in hepatocytes. this colocalization would control not only the production and clearance of atg but methylation activity as well  <cit> .

previous studies have suggested that exposure of human hepatocytes to elevated doses of iasiii  markedly reduced the production of dmas while at the same time increased the yields of mmas  <cit> . therefore, it is assumed here that the as3mt inactivation signal  affects only the second methylation reaction rate .

  dmagui=mt2  ×int1+intkmd× 

  mt2=as3mtfa×tanh+1  ×n2n2+n2×vmaxdkmd 

where, madgui and dmagui are the rates of arsenic methylation for the first and second methylation reactions respectively. vmaxm and vmaxdare the maximal rates of the first and second methylation reactions respectively; kmm and kmd are the half-saturation constants for the methylation reactions; kim and kid are the uncompetitive inhibition constants for the respective reactions n <dig>  n <dig> are the hill coefficients; kd <dig> and kd <dig> are the dissociation constants influencing the sigmoidal change in vmaxm and vmaxd; and fa is a coefficient of the second methylation reaction inactivation.

madg hydrolysis reaction is modeled using a "switch-like" formulation. for doses below the threshold, a hill-type formulation is used . above the threshold concentration, the rates of hydrolysis of madg and dmag to mmaiii and dmaiii, respectively, are assumed to be attenuated due to oxidative stress-induced gsh upregulation . on the other hand, this non-linear behavior may result in an increase or a decrease of gsh depending on the concentration of iasiii and the duration of exposure. the non-linear sigmoid function tanh is used here to describe this "switch-like" behavior; this formula has been previously used  <cit>  in a neurocomputational model to describe the non-linear threshold-dependent behavior of neuronal firing rate.

where hdm and hdd are the rates of hydrolysis of madg and dmag respectively. kmmaiiiint is the reaction rate constant for madg hydrolysis ; fgshm is the coefficient of inhibition of madg hydrolysis; n <dig> and kd <dig> are the hill coefficient and dissociation constant, respectively, for the inhibition term; kdmaiiiint is the reaction rate constant for dmag hydrolysis ; and fgshd is the coefficient of inhibition of dmag hydrolysis.

efflux of gsh  -bound arsenic adducts  is assumed to take place via multidrug resistant proteins , and is described by classical michaelis-menten kinetics. since madg is a substrate in the dimethylation reaction , its efflux rate is assumed to be affected by mrp levels  <cit> .

  mrpm=mrp×vmaxt2kmt <dig>             

where, vmaxt <dig> kmt <dig> and vmaxt <dig> kmt <dig> are the michaelis constants of the biophysical clearance of atg and madg, respectively; kmmaext and kdmaext are the rate constants of mma and dma clearance, respectively; fm and fd are the dimensionless coefficients of clearance of the respective processes affecting the maximal efflux.

the remaining biotransformation reactions include a series of methylation, glutathione conjugation and oxidation reactions  <cit>  .

  dintdt=katgint×int−kiasiiiint ×int−madgui−dextdt 

  dintdt=madgui  +kmadgint×int  −dmagui−hdm−dextdt                

where kmadgint is the rate constant of madg production catalyzed by the glutathione s-transferase  family of enzymes; koxm is the rate constant for mmaiii oxidation; kdmag is the rate constant for dmag production catalyzed by the glutathione s-transferase  family of enzymes and koxd is the rate constant for dmaiii oxidation. it has been suggested for this biotransformation pathway that trivalent arsenicals mostly bound to thiol-containing proteins are conjugated with gsh and methylated in the presence of arsenic methyltransferase   <cit> . therefore, the parameters katgint, kmadgint and kdmag indirectly represent the binding of trivalent arsenicals to thiol-containing proteins in the tk model.

the tk model has been implemented in matlab; the system of odes comprising the tk model is solved numerically using the stiff solver ode15s. first, the model parameters corresponding to low doses  were estimated using time course in vitro measurements of arsenicals following exposures to  <dig>  μm iasiii , from styblo et al.  <cit> ; it was assumed that at this dose, the hepatocytes exhibit no induced antioxidant response. subsequently, model parameters corresponding to a wider range of doses  were estimated using dose-response data  reported by drobna et al.  <cit> . the drobna dataset includes measured concentrations of iasiii, mma, and dma in primary cultured human hepatocytes after  <dig> h exposure to iasiii . for this case study, data on hepatocytes from one donor   <cit>  were used, since this donor had similar characteristics to the human donor in the study by styblo et al.  <cit>  . the deterministic optimization function fmincon was used for parameter estimation in both cases.

sensitivity analysis
sensitivity analysis provides estimates of how variation of model's output can be apportioned to different sources of variation in model parameters. this quantity is given by the formula:

  varpvar=dpd 

where y denotes model output and p denotes the vector of model parameters; dp and d illustrate the partial and total variance of the model output due to variation in model parameters according to assigned statistical distributions.

the fourier amplitude sensitivity test  decomposes the total variance of model output  into terms of increasing dimensionality. fast computes the total sensitivity indices , which account not only for the variance due to individual parameters , but also estimate the variance due to interaction among parameters  the total variance for n dimensions is given by

  d=∑i=1ndi+∑i=1n∑j=i+1ndij+...+d <dig> ,..,n 

the model parameters were assumed to be normally distributed with a coefficient of variation up to 10%; for some parameters, the coefficient of variation was 1%. ten thousand  samples were generated and the normal distributions for all parameters were truncated at 1% and 99% . three model outputs were selected for the sensitivity analysis: areas under the curve  of total retention of mma, dma and iasiii in human hepatocytes. the simlab modeling platform  <cit>  was used to perform the global sensitivity analysis.

comparison with the tk modeling formulation for rat hepatocytes
the tk model presented here was also compared with results from a published model for rat hepatocytes, in order to assess the inter-species differences and the feasibility of direct, cross-species extrapolation. specifically, the comparison focused on major intracellular processes that influence the different metabolizing rates between these two species. first, the tk modeling formulation of easterling et al.  <cit>  was parameterized using data from styblo et al.  <cit> . although, a direct comparison is not possible because of major differences in model structures, a subset of parameters was selected for comparison that describe three major biochemical processes which account for similar cellular phenomena in both models. these processes include transport of arsenite across cellular membrane, methylation of arsenic, and biotransformation of as3mt substrate . specific parameters used in comparison include  normalized activity of aqp <dig> , which is defined as the ratio of influx and efflux of arsenite,  normalized activity of as3mt , which is defined as the ratio of the corresponding reaction parameters, and  bioavailability of as3mt substrate , which is defined as the ratio of rates of hydrolysis and conjugation of ias for the human model, and the dissociation constant for the protein binding of arsenic in the rat model. these parameters are specified by equation  <dig>  and are described in table  <dig>  parameters governing the efflux of arsenic were not compared because there is no direct correspondence between the modeling formulations.

the two formulations are developed based on data of arsenic uptake and biotransformation in human and rat hepatocytes 

in order to facilitate direct comparison, approximate volumes of the cell cultures used in different experiments  were estimated. hepatocytes were assumed to have a spherical shape with  <dig> μm diameter for both humans and rats  <cit> . cellular volumes  for human and rat were estimated to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  μl respectively, based on the number of cells used in human hepatocytes experiments  and rat hepatocytes experiments   <cit> .

RESULTS
the semi-mechanistic tk model was parameterized using the fmincon function in matlab and time course data of arsenicals in human hepatocytes from styblo et al.  <cit> . the parameters are shown in table  <dig>  the model was able to capture the three distinct modes of the time course patterns corresponding to experimental data . in contrast, the only currently existing cellular level tk model for arsenic, from easterling et al.  <cit> , was parameterized using the same optimization technique and data, but the model was not able to adequately capture these modes .

the time-course estimates from the tk model show that initially  the rate of influx of aqp9s is substantially higher than the metabolism, thus leading to a fast accumulation of arsenite inside the cells. then, the influx is reduced, and metabolism increases, thus leading to a slow decrease in arsenite levels . during this period, mma production appears to be the dominant process, as shown by higher levels of mma compared to dma, attributable to the high rate of madg hydrolysis. subsequently, the arsenite concentrations decrease at a faster rate, the second methylation reaction becomes more significant, and madg hydrolysis is inhibited .

results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the relative contribution of variance of individual tk model parameters varied significantly across different doses of arsenite. as shown in figure 7a, at low doses , the transport parameter k <dig>  contributes most to the variance in intracellular mma levels. this agrees with easterling et al.  <cit> , who reported that the transport parameters are the most significant in relation to intracellular concentration of arsenicals. on the other hand, at higher doses, the parameters related to intracellular biotransformation of mma are the most influential. for  <dig> μm dose of iasiii the most significant parameters are koxm , fgshm , kmmaiiiint  and kmt <dig> . the first three parameters  directly influence oxidation and glutathione conjugation reactions involving mmaiii, whereas the michaelis constant  controls the activity of mrps that efflux madg from the cells. at high doses, induced antioxidant response of hepatocytes to arsenic leads to increased production of gsh and mrps in the cells, leading to higher production of madg, which can be readily effluxed via membrane-associated proteins. on the other hand, when the oxidation reaction is dominant , it results in higher production of mmav, which becomes accumulated in the cells, leading to overall increase in intracellular mma levels.

a fundamental hypothesis in this modeling formulation that allows the capturing of the dose-response profiles of arsenic retention and methylation across doses , is the introduction of threshold-dependent non-linear  mechanisms in the metabolic network due to oxidative stress . this assumption is based on findings that signaling motifs exhibit biological switches under a narrow range of endogenous or exogenous stimuli  <cit> . this is often described by a hill equation with a large hill coefficient . the large hill coefficient for inhibition of madg hydrolysis  points to potential "switch-like" behavior of the activation of nrf <dig> due to arsenic-mediated oxidative stress  <cit> .

the parametric comparison between human and rat hepatocyte tk models for arsenic, presented in table  <dig>  provides insight into factors that affect arsenic metabolism in hepatocytes. specifically, the as3mt activity is found to be not a significant factor. rats have been reported to be much faster metabolizers of arsenic than humans  <cit> , but based on this study this is attributed to other factors. specifically, in the rat-hepatocyte tk model , the protein-bound arsenite  is biotransformed to ias  at a much higher rate  compared to the biotransformation of iasiii to atg  of the human-hepatocyte tk model . this variability could be influenced by polymorphisms related to gsh production in hepatocytes  <cit>  or availability of thiol-containing proteins to interact with as3mt  <cit> .

this work demonstrates the development of a prototype semi-mechanistic toxicokinetic  model for arsenicals in human hepatocytes introducing features such as cooperativity and "switch-like" antioxidant response. even though this model is not directly applicable to in vivo systems as a standalone formulation, it can be applied to inform macroscopic metabolism-related parameters in the pbtk model. on the other hand, more experimental studies on arsenicals in human hepatocytes will substantially improve model structure and can help in characterizing inter-individual variability in arsenic metabolism. currently, the styblo et al. study  <cit>  is the only study in the authors' knowledge that reports time course profiles of arsenic methylation in human hepatocytes. furthermore, significant uncertainties exist in experimental data due to the limitations of widely used techniques such as hydride generation-atomic absorption spectroscopy  and high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry , where glutathione conjugated arsenic species atg and madg have been reported to be degraded to iasiii and mmaiii during the speciation analysis in the bile of rats exposed to arsenic  <cit> .

this cellular-level tk model is based on an arsenic biotransformation pathway where arsenic-gsh adducts  are substrates for the respective methylation reactions  <cit> . it should be pointed out that arsenic can be efficiently methylated even in the absence of gsh  <cit> , indicating that arsenic-gsh complexes need not be major species in the methylation of arsenic. on the other hand, the explicit consideration of arsenic-gsh complexes allows the description of a hysteresis behavior associated with methylation reactions and the stimulating role of gsh in these processes ; so, this mechanism has been selected in this model. it should be noted that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript to comparatively evaluate the different arsenic biotransformation mechanisms.

clearly it is, in principle, possible to incorporate into this cellular level tk model both the oxidative and reductive mechanisms as individual pathways. however, currently available experimental data are not adequate for estimating the relative contributions of each pathway. development of improved experimental techniques for quantifying binding of arsenicals to gsh and thiol-containing proteins will allow the estimation of the relative contribution of each pathway. since as3mt coexists in hepatocytes with a number of competing elements that affect its action, its activity should be determined based on the availability of each of these elements. for instance, to study the effectiveness of the oxidative mechanism, it is possible to knock out gsh biosynthesis in hepatocytes by interfering with the activity of glutamate-cysteine ligase   <cit> , and exposing them to various doses of arsenite. such data sets can be used to estimate as3mt activities along the two competing reaction pathways; this type of information is necessary in order to extend the mathematical formulation of the model described here to include both competing methylation pathways.

parameter identification is an important issue in computational biology since most of the models involve more parameters than the available data. the tk model was parameterized using data on total arsenic of three species  and it was able to capture the modes of arsenic retention and methylation in human hepatocytes, but was not able to exactly capture the time-course profiles from the experimental data. in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with this issue, sensitivity analysis and testing were conducted as a means to identify the relative impact of each parameter on model predictions  <cit> . additional time-course data  can improve model performance, and can help obtain additional mechanistic insights into the dynamics of arsenicals in hepatocytes.

CONCLUSIONS
a cellular-level tk model was developed based on a recently proposed pathway of arsenic biotransformation. this model can describe uptake, retention and clearance of arsenicals in human hepatocytes using a semi-mechanistic approach. it highlights the key biological processes that influence arsenic metabolism by explicitly modelling the metabolic network of gsh-adducts formation  <cit> . moreover, comparison of the model structure and parameters with a rat-hepatocyte tk model  <cit>  highlights the relative roles of different metabolic reactions in the methylation of arsenic. ongoing work involves incorporating this cellular-level semi-mechanistic tk model as a module within a whole-body pbtk model of arsenic  <cit> , in order to improve the pbtk model parameterization and its predictions  <cit> .
