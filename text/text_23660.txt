BACKGROUND
mastitis is one of the most costly of all metabolic diseases and disorders in the dairy industry and occurs most frequently during early lactation  <cit> . the innate immune response, primarily consisting of milk macrophages and neutrophils , is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. the initial stages associated with innate immunity in the mammary gland are not well understood. mammary epithelial cells  have immunological functions that contribute to the initial response to an intramammary infection   <cit> . researchers have used mec lines or mammary tissue biopsies to study the immunological role of mec through response to in vitro challenges with both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  microarray as well as quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  technology could provide useful information on additional signals produced by mec during an imi  <cit> .

streptococcus uberis  is a major environmental mastitis-causing pathogen  <cit> . infections due to s. uberis are predominantly subclinical  and are responsible for up to 16% and 33% of clinical cases per year in the united states and the united kingdom  <cit> . subclinical mastitis is the dominant form of mastitis affecting cows and frequently goes undetected and untreated for extended periods of time, which can result in spreading to other cows and significant reductions in profitability due to losses of production and milk premiums  <cit> . recently, swanson et al.  <cit>  examined the mammary tissue transcriptome via microarray technology of  <dig> friesian heifers in mid-to-late lactation after imi with a noncapsular strain of s. uberis . genes involved with immune response were up-regulated and genes involved in lipid metabolism and cell death were down-regulated after imi with s. uberis. the capsular strain o140j has been shown to be more resistant to pmn phagocytosis and more capable of establishing infection when compared to a noncapsular strain  <cit> . however, the pathogenic mechanisms of s. uberis strain o140j are still unclear, thus, transcriptomic evaluation of mammary tissue gene expression after imi with s. uberis o140j is clearly warranted. more importantly, identifying molecular pathways and gene networks affected by imi with this strain would yield mechanistic information of the underlying tissue adaptations to infection.

the main objective of this study was to determine the most affected gene networks and pathways in mammary tissue in response to an imi with s. uberis o140j. we hypothesized that imi with s. uberis would up-regulate genes involved with immune response and alter expression of genes involved with milk synthesis and composition as well as tissue function.

RESULTS
indicators of clinical response to imi challenge
all cows developed both local and systemic responses to imi challenge. details on local and systemic responses to imi challenge with s. uberis are described elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, in response to imi challenge, heart rate and body temperature were significantly elevated , and there was a trend  for increased respiration rate. all cows developed mastitis after imi challenge with s. uberis. clinical signs, such as flakes, watery, or yellow colored mammary secretions were observed after inoculation . milk somatic cell count  from challenged quarters was increased  by  <dig> h when compared to  <dig> h post-inoculation . an overall increase  in growth of s. uberis was observed in inoculated quarters. by  <dig> h post-inoculation, s. uberis was recovered from all challenged quarters and shedding continued through  <dig> h post-inoculation similar to results of others  <cit> . details on individual quarter scc and shedding of s. uberis are shown in figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig> 

based on previous work in our laboratory  <cit> , as well as challenging  <dig> 'test' cows prior to our experiment, peak clinical signs based on heart rate, respiration rate, milk secretion, shedding of s. uberis and, most importantly, increased scc occurred between 24- <dig> h post-challenge. therefore, biopsies were taken prior to peak clinical signs to be more confidient that the majority of gene expression data was attributed to mec and not infiltrating neutrophils. additionally, after biopsy , tissue  was blotted with sterile gauze to remove any visible milk secretions, and visible connective tissue was cut off and removed. the infiltration of immune cells was assessed via specific macrophage and neutrophil gene markers present on the bovine microarray . the data indicated an absence or a very slight increase in infiltration due to imi by  <dig> h post-inoculation. therefore, most of the responses in the present analysis must be attributed to mec; however, resident macrophages constitute ca. 5% or more of the parenchyma tissue  <cit>  and increased activity of those cells could be detectable via gene expression, particularly for genes with low inherent expression in mec.

differential expression of genes in s. uberis-infected quarters
a total of  <dig>  oligonucleotides  were differentially expressed  in response to imi infection  . of these,  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and  <dig>  genes were down-regulated. from ingenuity pathway analysis® , a total of  <dig>  genes were mapped or recognized based on annotation to a human or mouse ortholog within the ipa knowledge base. of these,  <dig>  genes were eligible for generating networks and  <dig>  genes were mapped to known functions and/or pathways based on published data across several species, including human, rat and mouse . when a  <dig> -fold change cut-off was applied, among  <dig> oligos which passed this additional criterion,  <dig> genes were eligible for networks and  <dig> for functions and/or pathways analysis. functions, pathways, and gene networks for the analysis of  <dig> -fold change cut-off generated via ipa are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

qpcr
table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> lists genes selected for qpcr. a total of  <dig> genes were analyzed:  <dig> were differentially expressed with microarrays,  <dig> genes were not present on the microarray platform, and  <dig> genes were not significant at an fdr ≤  <dig> . the latter genes were selected based on their involvement in immune response or lipid metabolism. among deg,  <dig> %  correspond to results of microarrays. considering all the genes tested with qpcr we observed that acp <dig> and bax had responses opposite to microarray results, adfp, adrb <dig>  alox5ap, anxa <dig>  c <dig>  c1qc, hmox <dig>  il <dig>  il1b, insr, nr3c <dig>  prkcb <dig>  saa <dig>  socs <dig>  and tnf, which were not significantly affected in microarrays  were found to be affected significantly by qpcr . in addition, bax, il <dig>  lalba, sdhd, and vldlr were significant with microarray but not with qpcr. quantitative pcr is a more sensitive method of for gene expression analysis, thus, the qpcr data instead of the microarray data were used for ipa analysis in all cases as we have done in previous work  <cit> . six genes  measured via qpcr were not present on the microarray platform but have been shown to be involved in immune response or metabolic pathways in mammary tissue  <cit> . of these, all but cox <dig> were up-regulated by imi.

functional analysis using ipa and gene ontology 
the use of ipa  and go  on the entire list of deg  or those with a  <dig> -fold cut-off revealed marked activation of genes associated with immune-related and inflammatory-related functions as well as an overall inhibition of lipid-related functions.

in particular, the ipa analysis  with all  <dig>  deg uncovered induction of a wide number of functions:

- proliferation of smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells , lymphocytes, and fibroblasts

- apoptosis of immune cells but a likely inhibition for epithelial cells

- large recruitment and infiltration of immune cells, particularly pmn, but also smooth muscle cells and bone marrow cells

- quantity of nitrite, as well as release of lipid with a likely increase in glucose transport

- the synthesis of nitric oxide was markedly induced, together with the production of peroxide and hydrolysis of gtp

- remodeling of tissue

- adhesion and activation of immune cells

- angiogenesis

- cell cycle activity, with a likely increase in the differentiation of lymphocytes but a decrease in differentiation of muscle cells

- morphological changes in cells, particularly for leukocytes and fibroblasts, with large reorganization of the cytoskeleton and formation of blebbings

- strong activation of inflammation, but when considering the entire transcriptional and animal  responses, the direction of gene expression suggested and overall decrease of inflammation

- likely inhibition of triacylglycerol  synthesis but an overall induction of lipid synthesis, particularly prostaglandins.

besides immune-related functions which included binding and activity of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α and chemokines, the go molecular function analysis  uncovered an increase in binding of genes encoding heat-shock proteins, nad, and tetratricopeptide repeat  domain of a protein, the latter being important in the regulation of vasorelaxation  <cit> . in addition, analysis highlighted a decrease in genes encoding cofactor binding, particularly mn and se, a reduction of protein ser/thr phosphatase activity, reduction of oxidoreductase by nad/nadp, an increase in long-chain fatty acid ligase activity but reduction of several processes related to acyl-carrier proteins.

the biological processes most enriched in go  indicated a marked effect on cell signaling, mostly related to apoptosis . the immune response, and associated metabolism  and response to wounding, were the most affected and activated processes. proliferation was highly increased in immune but also in endothelial cells. protein metabolism also was highly activated, with protein transport being the most enriched process, particularly protein targeting which was increased. interestingly, data indicated an increase in transport of proteins towards mitochondria. data also suggested a marked increase in post-translational modification of proteins such as folding, methylation, and alkylation. the analysis indicated a sparing of the amino acid ser, probably for protein synthesis, by inhibition of its catabolic utilization. transcription was strongly activated, as well as post-transcriptional modification, while catabolism of dna was inhibited. the transport of minerals, particularly di- and tri-valent cations , was largely increased. fatty acid biosynthesis was evidently inhibited. malate metabolism, both mitochondrial  and cytosolic was highly-activated. there was also an inhibition of kinase activity. lastly, as highlighted by ipa, the regulation of adhesion was highly activated.

the go results for cellular components significantly affected during s. uberis infection  revealed a strong morphological change of cells, mostly for the formation of filopodium, i.e. "microspikes" or cytoplasmic projections from migrating cells which play an important role in cell migration and wound healing  <cit> . extrinsic component of membranes were increased in abundance with large effect on proteins present in the cytoplasm and organelles. among those most enriched was the endoplasmic reticulum , particularly the transport from nucleus to er. increased abundance also was evident for components of actin filaments, which agrees with the findings for cytoskeletal rearrangement reported above for go and ipa. interestingly, components of lysosomes and the golgi were inhibited, as well as components of the vesicle membrane; whereas, er-golgi intermediate compartment components were induced. components of the proteasome, involved in protein degradation, were also induced together with the mhc complex components. the increase in abundance of the phosphatase type 2a complex supports the increase in prostaglandin synthesis uncovered by ipa.

overall, the analysis of deg with ≥  <dig> -fold by ipa  and go  provided results strikingly similar to the ones obtained using all deg. this suggested that the functions found as significantly-enriched in the latter analysis included genes whose expression was highly affected. the go analysis, however, allowed us to uncover a marked up-regulation in expression of genes for g-coupled receptors, cytokine and chemokine-mediated signaling, nfκb import into nucleus; whereas, down-regulated genes were associated with muscle development and organization. the significant enrichment of negative regulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of fatty acid metabolism via go analysis also was noteworthy. go analysis results for cellular components and molecular functions among deg ≥  <dig> -fold  confirmed the analysis that included all deg.

canonical pathway analysis using ipa
the top canonical signaling and metabolic pathways within all deg  are reported in table  <dig>  detailed images of selected pathways are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and all pathways are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as for the functional analysis , most of the pathways affected via ipa analysis were related to immune or inflammatory functions. it was striking that signaling pathways were the most affected and very few, with lower significance, among all deg were metabolic pathways.

among signaling pathways, those data revealed a unique landscape where induction of certain pathways which limit the inflammatory response  was coupled with activation of certain pathways which promote the inflammatory response . glucocorticoid signaling  and other pathways related to the latter, such as erk/mapk and pi3k/akt signaling , were highly enriched and were likely induced except erk/mapk signaling, which the detailed analysis did not indicate induction or inhibition. it was evident that most of the pathways represented within the deg were inhibited. pathways strongly inhibited were cdk <dig> signaling , related to neuronal function, and igf <dig> signaling  related to proliferation and survival of cells. there also were other pathways related to neuronal activity that were evidently inhibited such as ephrin receptor signaling and axonal guidance signaling . pathway analysis also revealed a decrease of ceramide signaling for apoptosis, which suggested that the significant response related to apoptosis uncovered by the functional analysis, was not related to ceramides. interestingly, results showed that two signaling pathways related to lipid metabolism  were inhibited by imi.

there were few significant metabolic pathways within the  <dig>  deg which we considered marginally significant . details of the pathways indicated a decrease in synthesis and oxidation/reduction of nadh and nadph, an overall decrease of pyruvate metabolism, and an evident increase in utilization of pyruvate for the tca cycle through formation of malate coupled with decrease of pyruvate utilization for other processes . arginine and pro metabolism also were affected. more detailed analysis of this pathway indicated a decreased utilization of arg for catabolism and an increased utilization of this amino acid for protein synthesis. similarly, there was evidence for increased utilization of pro for other metabolic purposes besides synthesis of protein .

the top canonical pathways among deg affected by ≥  <dig> -fold are shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  these included il- <dig> signaling, lxr/rxr signaling, il- <dig> signaling, and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. the majority of genes with ≥  <dig> -fold change within these pathways were up-regulated. all those pathways were related to immune response and lipid metabolism, with a general induction of immune-related pathways and inhibition of lipid-related ones. this apparently negative association between immune response and lipid metabolism is supported by the primary functions that were observed in ipa and go when all deg were considered . interleukin- <dig> signaling was the primary canonical pathway affected by imi challenge with s. uberis among those genes with > <dig> -fold change in expression . the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells  <dig>  belongs to the immunoglobulin  family of cell surface receptors and is selectively expressed on blood pmn, monocytes and macrophages. trem- <dig> lacks known signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic domain and thus activation by trem- <dig> is mediated by a transmembrane adaptor molecule dnax-activating protein  <dig> , leading to proinflammatory immune responses. overall, ipa analysis indicated that early response factors during imi with s. uberis encompass large effect on expression of genes associated not only with immune response  but also endocrine signaling  in mammary tissue.

gene networks among deg with ≥  <dig> -fold during imi challenge
we identified  <dig> networks  within ipa analyses that were associated with imi challenge among the deg affected by ≥  <dig> -fold  based on microarray and qpcr. the top  <dig> networks were merged to evaluate relationships between individual deg during imi challenge with s. uberis. these networks included a total of  <dig> deg involved in pathways and functions including immune response, immune disease, connective tissue disorders, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, molecular transport, cell-to-cell signaling, tissue development, cellular development, and immune and lymphatic system development and function. the results of merging those networks are shown in additional file  <dig>  within this larger network, a subset of deg  identified as having the greatest fold-change in expression that play major roles in either immune response and/or lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are shown in figure  <dig>  these genes encode cytokines , lipid metabolism-related genes , acute phase proteins , transcription regulators , receptors , peptidases , and others such as selp, sell, and sod <dig> . all genes in this network , except for gpam and fabp <dig>  were verified by qpcr . of these, only saa <dig> had results opposite of microarrays. however, saa <dig> was not significantly affected with microarray .

of the  <dig> genes up-regulated  within the network, all play a role in some aspect of the immune response including cytokine activity , cell adhesion , immune activation , acute phase reaction , apoptosis , and plasminogen metabolism . interestingly, induction of plasminogen metabolism has been used as an indication of virulence of s. uberis associated with bovine mastitis  <cit> . of the  <dig> deg down-regulated , the majority are involved in milk fat synthesis . the network revealed that tnf, at least judging by human/rodent data within the ipa knowledge base, has both direct and indirect positive relationships  with deg involved in immune response and negative relationships  with deg associated with lipid metabolism.

discussion
immune system response genes
general considerations
the microarray analysis clearly indicated that the mammary gland after a  <dig> h inoculation with s. uberis experienced a wide transcriptional response, which encompassed >  <dig>  genes. overall, the functional analysis uncovered that few functions were significantly affected, i.e. immune response was clearly the most affected and induced followed by cell proliferation/cycle/death and transport of protein and ions both of which were induced. in contrast, lipid metabolism was inhibited. cell proliferation was seemingly or evidently induced in ipa analysis but go analysis revealed that regulation of cell proliferation was not clearly towards induction, suggesting that the process of proliferation was probably increased for certain cells  but was not important for others. the overall picture from ipa and go analyses captured the most affected functions but did not provide information of the potential mechanisms at play. the use of well-established pathways  together with information about single genes provided additional means to unravel the mechanisms controlling the mammary response to imi before peak clinical signs.

top up-regulated deg
numerous cytokines involved in the immune response were significantly up-regulated in mammary tissue during imi challenge with s. uberis. genes coding for the cytokines tnf, il <dig>  and il1b were among the top deg . furthermore, among the list of all deg  there were several up-regulated deg that belong to pro-inflammatory pathways including cd <dig>  traf <dig>  nfkbia, nfkb <dig>  and stat <dig> . functional analysis with go and ipa clearly underscored the induction of inflammation as well as cytokine binding in mammary tissue from imi . other cytokines or cytokine receptors up-regulated during s. uberis imi included il <dig> and il1r <dig> . interleukin- <dig>  can induce interferon gamma  production from t cells and, in combination with il- <dig>  il- <dig> can inhibit il-4-dependent immunoglobulin  e and igg <dig> production as well as activate igg2a secretion by b cells  <cit> . however, microarray analysis indicated that expression of il <dig> and ifng was not significantly altered during imi challenge with s. uberis and that il4r expression increased . this may indicate that the up-regulation of il <dig> had minimal downstream affects on the innate immune response to s. uberis. similar results were observed by yang et al.  <cit>  where il <dig> expression, but not ifng, was up-regulated in mec after imi challenge with staphylococcus aureus .

the chemokine il <dig> had the greatest change in expression resulting in a fold-change of  <dig>  in infected vs. control quarters . the importance of this protein and its related functions was underscored by go molecular function analysis both when the entire deg or those with > <dig> -fold were analyzed . this chemokine is induced upon stimulation of tnf or il- <dig>  and serves as a primary chemoattractant during the innate immune response, thus, playing a major role in the chemotaxis of pmn. therefore, it seems logical that the dramatic increase in il <dig> expression would occur before peak clinical signs of mastitis. swanson et al.  <cit>  did not observe a significant change in il <dig> expression in bovine mammary tissue after imi with s. uberis ; but increased il <dig> mrna expression has been reported in primary isolates of bovine mec after challenge with escherichia coli   <cit> . with regards to results of swanson et al.  <cit> , mammary tissue was collected between 60- <dig> hours post-inoculation when peak clinical signs already had occurred. in our study, mammary biopsies were performed prior to peak clinical response and prior to the major influx of pmn into the mammary gland , milk compositional changes and clinical signs of mastitis  <cit> , and our previous work using this dose and strain of s. uberis  <cit> .

the anti-inflammatory il- <dig> and pro-inflammatory il- <dig> pathways are activated before peak clinical signs
interleukin- <dig> signaling was among the primary canonical pathways affected by imi challenge with s. uberis . the binding of the il- <dig> cytokine family to the il- <dig> receptor mediates the activity of traf <dig> , leading to activation of the p <dig> mapk signaling pathway that ultimately leads to increased transcription of il <dig>  despite a significant down-regulation of p <dig> mapk  during imi, the observed  <dig> -fold up-regulation of il1b and  <dig> -fold up-regulation of il1r <dig> probably overcame that response and also might have been sufficient to account for the fact that jak <dig> expression was down-regulated . interleukin- <dig> is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that blocks nf-κb activity, which leads to suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tnf, il <dig>  and il <dig>  expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> putative components  of the il- <dig> signaling pathway present in our microarray platform were moderately but significantly up-regulated . of interest was the mild up-regulation of stat <dig>  which in turn is known to activate socs <dig> and activate il-6-signaling  <cit> . despite the marked up-regulation of il <dig>  our results of pathway analysis were indicative of more pronounced inflammation and probably hampered il- <dig> anti-inflammatory activity.

interleukin- <dig> signaling was a major pathway affected by imi challenge with s. uberis . several genes overlap between il- <dig> and il- <dig> signaling, including an up-regulation of tnf, il1b, nfkbia, stat <dig>  traf <dig>  and fos and down-regulation of mapk <dig>  expression of il <dig> occurs via the nf-κb signaling pathway. interleukin- <dig> is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is also involved in acute-phase protein signaling . the coordinated up-regulation of genes involved in both il- <dig> and il- <dig> signaling during imi with s. uberis is suggestive of an ability of the immune system to generate a pro-inflammatory response via the il- <dig> signaling pathway while attempting to control the severity and duration of the inflammation via the anti-inflammatory il- <dig> signaling pathway. by far, however, our data suggested that the pro-inflammatory response via il <dig> and tnf overrode the anti-inflammatory response via il <dig> 

il- <dig> also has been shown to have anti-inflammatory capabilities through inhibition of il-1β and tnf  <cit> . in our study, however, the signaling pathway through tnf and il- <dig> appeared largely activated , with a more pronounced up-regulation of nfkbia  than nfkb <dig> , which suggested a potential inhibitory effect on the induction of survival genes via nfkb <dig>  <cit>  and a control of inflammatory response. in the context of regulation of cell death/survival, it was evident that cell survival via enhanced growth and differentiation might have been inhibited due to imi because the genes coding for phosphorylation enzymes in the erk /mapk  signaling pathway, which is involved in control of a broad range of intracellular functions  <cit>  were down-regulated . these data suggested that signaling through phosphorylation  was inhibited as a result of imi. this latter finding was also observed by go analysis .

our results regarding il- <dig> and il- <dig> support the work of swanson et al.  <cit>  who observed an up-regulation of the il <dig> receptor  and il <dig> receptor alpha  in bovine mammary tissue after s. uberis imi. similar to our data, lutzow et al.  <cit>  after imi challenge with staph. aureus observed an up-regulation  of genes involved in both il- <dig> and il- <dig> signaling including il1b, il <dig>  il <dig>  cd <dig>  fos, and nfkbia. in our study, we isolated whey from all infected quarters and analyzed samples for concentrations of il- <dig>  il-1β, and tnf at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h  post-inoculation  <cit> . no significant changes in cytokine concentrations were observed by  <dig> h post-inoculation when compared to pre-infection levels . this may be attributed to the fact that the mammary biopsies were performed prior to peak clinical signs of mastitis in order to avoid tissue samples with elevated amounts of mrna from infiltrating pmn. unfortunately, the side effects of the biopsy procedure  made it impossible to isolate whey from mammary secretions during peak clinical signs. however, bannerman et al.  <cit>  evaluated cytokine secretions in whey collected from mammary quarters challenged with s. uberis and observed elevated milk concentrations of il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf, and ifn-γ compared with healthy quarters by ~ <dig> h post-challenge.

toll-like receptor signaling
bacteria contain pathogen-associated molecular patterns  motifs, such as lps or lipoteichoic acid , that are potent stimulators of innate immunity. lipid a is considered the active motif for the pamp activity of lps from gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli that stimulates the innate immune response and activates tlr- <dig> and the lps-lps binding protein-cd <dig> complex; however, the active motif for the pamp activity of lta  remains unknown. regardless, tlr- <dig> protein is activated via lta. the toll-like receptor  signaling pathway results in the synthesis of several pro-inflammatory cytokines  and chemokines . although this pathway was not among the most significant in ipa analysis , several genes involved in tlr signaling were up-regulated during imi challenge including tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  casp <dig>  cd <dig>  fos, irak <dig>  traf <dig>  and nfkbia. all genes were verified via qpcr . in addition, tollip , a negative regulator of inflammation, was also significantly up-regulated .

several studies have evaluated gene expression profiles in mammary tissue or mec lines after challenge with another gram-positive bacterium, staph. aureus  <cit> . lutzow et al.  <cit>  observed that staph. aureus alters both tlr- <dig> and tlr- <dig> signaling pathways. they observed an up-regulation of tlr <dig>  fos, and nfkbia during imi challenge with staph. aureus as well as tlr <dig> and cd <dig>  both of which are primarily activated via lps from gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli. these researchers also observed an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators including tnf, il1b, il <dig>  and il <dig> after imi with staph. aureus. however, yang et al.  <cit>  observed that imi challenge with high doses of staph. aureus  failed to activate nf-κb signaling and the pro-inflammatory genes tnf and cxcl <dig>  a "weak" immune response may be attributed to the virulence factors associated with this strain of staph. aureus, because heat-inactivated staph. aureus increased the expression of tlr signaling components and nf-κb activation  <cit> . the tlr-mediated nf-κb activation not only signals numerous pro-inflammatory genes but also other anti-microbial immune defense genes such as beta-defensins, which are oxygen-independent peptides that have potent anti-microbial activities  <cit> . our data also showed a significant increase in expression of bnbd <dig>  the most abundantly-expressed member of the beta-defensin family of bactericidal peptides in mec   <cit> . our data support results from swanson et al.  <cit> , who found increased expression of lingual antimicrobial peptide , a member of the beta-defensin family, during imi challenge with s. uberis.

our microarray analysis demonstrated an increased expression of both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> after imi challenge with s. uberis compared with control quarters. however, swanson et al.  <cit>  observed an up-regulation of tlr <dig> but not tlr <dig> expression in bovine mammary tissue after s. uberis imi. increased expression of both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> signaling pathways during imi challenge with gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria has been observed in recent studies  <cit> . most of these studies have examined tlr expression patterns in response to e. coli or staph. aureus, both major pathogens associated with mastitis in the dairy industry. goldammer et al.  <cit>  reported an increased expression of both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  in bovine mammary quarters naturally infected with s. aureus when compared to healthy quarters. this response is supported by results of yang et al.  <cit> , where both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> were up-regulated after imi challenge with either staph. aureus or e. coli. similar results were also observed when bovine mec were challenged with lps  <cit> , as well as in mammary tissue after imi challenge with staph. aureus   <cit> .

other deg involved with immune response
other deg of interest that were significantly up-regulated during imi challenge with s. uberis included hla-dra  and c1qc . hla-dra codes for the major histocompatability complex type ii  dr alpha and is primarily expressed on t lymphocytes and macrophages. this gene is considered a candidate gene marker of disease resistance  <cit> . the role of mhc ii in mammary tissue is unclear. fitzpatrick et al.  <cit> observed expression of mhc ii-positive cells in the connective tissue of the healthy mammary quarters and quarters infected with formalin-killed s. uberis; although individual cell identification was not conducted. swanson et al.  <cit>  reported an up-regulation of hla-dra  in bovine mammary tissue after s. uberis imi. the mhc ii complex presents antigen fragments to t-helper cells by binding to the cd <dig> receptor on t-helper cells. however, we did not detect differential expression of cd <dig>  although mammary tissue was thoroughly blotted with gauze to remove any visual milk secretions, it is possible that the expression of hla-dra may have been acquired through milk lymphocytes and macrophages present in mammary tissue during the biopsy. mhc ii expression in mec warrants further investigation. the observed up-regulation of c1qc was opposite to results from both swanson et al.  <cit>  who found down-regulation  after s. uberis imi and those of günther et al.  <cit>  who observed a  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold decrease in mrna expression of factors associated with the c <dig> complex  in bovine mec after challenge with e. coli. the complement component c1q is the first step in the initiation of the classical pathway of the complement cascade  <cit> . researchers have not been able to quantify c1q concentrations in mastitic milk and primarily attribute this to its large size , which may render it impermeable to the mammary epithelium  <cit> .

no current information is available on the use of the lectin pathway in the mammary gland during an imi. researchers have concluded that the mammary gland must lack the classical pathway and therefore must rely primarily on the alternative pathway of the complement system  <cit> . the initial step of the alternative pathway involves the cleavage of complement component  <dig>  into fragments c3a and c3b. the expression of c <dig>  was significantly up-regulated  in mammary quarters infected with s. uberis and supports the work of swanson et al.  <cit> . the c <dig> component has been quantified in mastitic milk  <cit> . c <dig> is also a downstream intermediate step involved with both the classical and alternative pathways of the complement system that ultimately leads to the assembly of the membrane attack complex , which consists of complement proteins c5a, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  the membrane attack complex plays a role in the disruption of the bacteria cell walls during the immune response.

two genes involved in inhibition of the complement cascade were significantly up-regulated in infected versus non-infected mammary quarters. these genes were cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  . cd <dig> is involved in the inhibition of the assembly of the membrane attack complex. cd <dig>  or the decay accelerating factor for complement, binds to both the c2-c4b complex of the classical pathway and the c3-cfb complex of the alternative pathway. this binding accelerates their decay, disrupting the cleavage of c <dig> into c3b and c3a fragments, which leads to inhibition of the cascade and prevention of damage to host cells. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a significant up-regulation in expression of the c1qc gene from mammary quarters infected with s. uberis. swanson et al.  <cit>  observed an inverse relationship between c1q expression  and c <dig>  after s. uberis imi. the researchers did not elaborate on the inverse relationship in gene expression patterns between c <dig> and c1q. further research related to the classical pathway of the complement cascade in the mammary gland is needed.

cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis
the overall functional analysis both in ipa and go clearly indicated an induction of proliferation of several types of cells but in particular immune, endothelial, and muscle cells. in contrast, several significantly-enriched pathways related to proliferation/angiogenesis were strongly  or likely inhibited , with both the platelet-derived growth factor  and pi3k/akt signaling pathways likely induced .

angiogenesis and inflammation: possible role of pdgf signaling and hypoxia
platelet-derived growth factor  refers to a family of dimeric isoforms that are important for growth, survival, and function especially in connective tissue  <cit> . four different pdgf chains have been identified, the classical pdgf-a and pdgf-b and the more recent pdgf-c and pdgf-d isoforms. these isoforms that occur as homodimers or heterodimers  exert their effects by differential binding to two receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . binding of pdgf induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase receptors. depending on the pdgf isoform involved, homo or heterodimers of the receptor are formed. it is interesting that paracrine pdgf-b signaling has a role in blood vessel formation  and it is a potent effector of epithelial cancer growth  <cit> . the likely induction of pdgf pathway in our study might partly explain the induction of biological processes such as positive regulation of cell proliferation and vasculature development . in fact, signaling through pdgf might have counteracted the marked inhibition of the ephrin receptor signaling pathway , which also is a pro-angiogenic pathway  <cit> .

a key factor contributing to angiogenesis and aberrant cellular growth  is hypoxia  <cit> . as cells outgrow their blood supply or are deprived of oxygen, a transcriptional response to hypoxia is initiated. although several transcription factor pathways seem to be involved, most attention has focused on hypoxia-inducible factor  <dig> , which was up-regulated with imi . this is a heterodimer of two dna binding proteins, hif1a, and the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator   <cit> . in normoxia, hif1a is unstable and rapidly degrades via the proteasome, but as oxygen tension drops below 2% , hif1a is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus and interacts with hif1b. the heterodimer initiate a complex transcriptional program via specific hypoxia response elements  <cit> . in our experiment, we observed up-regulation of many hypoxia-responsive genes as seen in non-ruminants  <cit> , e.g. hif1a and several others involved in glucose metabolism/glycolysis , growth factors/cytokines , oxygen transport and iron metabolism , as well as several other genes/transcription factors involved in wound healing and angiogenesis  . it is also interesting that both pyruvate and lactate originating from anaerobic glycolysis in tissues are angiogenic  <cit> . in the context of our study, a greater uptake of glucose due to up-regulation of slc2a <dig> coupled with a reduction in the need for tag synthesis as well as lactose for secretion in milk  could have led to accumulation of pyruvate from glycolysis and might have played a role in promoting hypoxia. the accumulation of pyruvate seems to be supported also by the likely inhibition of pyruvate metabolism .

despite up-regulation of hif1a and aryl hydrocarbon receptor  due to imi, our pathway analysis revealed that the two signaling pathways associated with response to hypoxia  were for the most part inhibited . in the case of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway, it seems likely that the marked increases in il <dig> and activation of nfkbia  were the main causes for overall inhibition of the pathway.

the mystery of igf <dig> signaling and inflammation
insulin-like growth factor binding  <dig>  is considered an anabolic hormone and plays a pivotal role in mammary development  <cit>  and potentially in maintaining the epithelial cells during the declining phase of lactation  <cit> . however, there is no evidence of a role of igf <dig> in lactating mammary tissue, at the least in bovine. in support of this, work from one of our laboratories has observed that igf <dig> signaling is not among the significantly affected pathways in bovine mammary tissue during lactation and appeared to be inhibited .

the igf <dig> signaling pathway  was strongly inhibited after s. uberis challenge, suggesting "resistance" of mammary tissue to igf <dig> during imi. in the immune system, signaling via igf <dig> is a crucial event resulting in postponement of apoptosis  of pmn through mediation of the pi3k signaling pathway  <cit> . if that holds true in mammary after imi, our data suggest that apoptosis of pmn was probably substantial at  <dig> h post inoculation. the functional analysis in ipa indicated that apoptosis was significantly affected, with a balance between induction and inhibition  but overall this process was likely induced particularly in macrophages . furthermore, as indicated by go analysis , apoptosis occurred through caspase activation .

to our knowledge a direct inhibitory effect of inflammation on igf <dig> signaling has not been reported; however, modulation of igf signaling by glucocorticoids in muscle was previously demonstrated  <cit> . this observation suggests a possible effect of corticoids prior to mammary tissue collection. however, plasma cortisol was not increased significantly in cows after imi in the present experiment  <cit> . in summary, the inhibition of igf <dig> signaling might have played a role in decreased immune cell survival, particularly macrophages. a possible inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on this pathway cannot be excluded. the inhibition of igf <dig> signaling after imi in bovine mammary is a novel finding that still requires teleological explanation.

lipid metabolism and immune response
integration of lipid metabolism and inflammation: possible role of lxr/rxr and ppar signaling pathways
both lxrs and ppars are involved in the regulation of metabolic and inflammatory signaling  <cit> . ppara is expressed in liver, brown adipose tissue, heart, and muscle tissue and plays a pivotal role in fatty acid catabolism  <cit> ; whereas, ppar-γ  is highly expressed in adipose tissue and macrophages and primarily regulates adipogenesis  <cit> . ppar-γ has been shown to be expressed in bovine mammary tissue and is also significantly increased during lactation  <cit> . ppara and pparg have anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . pparg has been shown to interfere with the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors such as stat and nf-κb in macrophages  <cit> .

in non-ruminant macrophages, studies have shown that ligand-activated lxr inhibits expression of genes involved with immune response  <cit> . interestingly, studies have also shown that tlr <dig> activation in macrophages inhibits lxr signaling  <cit> . activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and release of inflammatory mediators are fundamental to the diverse immune functions of macrophages, and the mammary gland possesses resident macrophages  <cit> . in addition to inducing genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport, lxr reciprocally represses a set of inflammatory genes after bacterial lipopolysacharide , tnf, or il-1β stimulation  <cit> . examples of such genes include those involved in generation of bioactive molecules such as nos2a, il- <dig>  tnf, and il-1β, the chemokines ccl <dig>  and matrix metallopeptidases. we found that imi resulted in marked up-regulation of il <dig> , tnf , il1b , and ccl <dig>  and moderate but significant up-regulation of nos2a  and mmp <dig> . as previously stated, most of the responses in the present study are likely attributed to mec and potentially resident macrophages, which constitute ca. 5% or more of the parenchyma tissue  <cit> . it is possible that increased nos2a expression may be attributed to resident macrophages. however, studies have reported increased expression of the endothelial  and inducible  forms of nitric oxide synthase in human  <cit>  and murine  <cit>  breast cancer tissue. the increased tlr <dig> expression after imi in our study may partly explain the down-regulation of the genes involved with lxr/rxr signaling. the tlr <dig> response might have been driven via up-regulation of irf <dig>   <cit> .

studies investigating the lxr/rxr signaling pathway in the mammary gland are sparse and have primarily focused on expression of genes involved in this pathway during murine lactation regardless of bacteriological status  <cit> . mouse mammary microarray data  <cit>  has suggested the potential involvement of two systems in controlling fatty acid metabolism. these include the lxr/rxr pathway controlling 1) β-oxidation of fatty acids via lxr /ppar dimers; and 2) fatty acid synthesis involving the lxr/rxr dimer, which induce expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins  <dig>  and  <dig> .

the lactating bovine mammary gland does not seem to oxidize long-chain fatty acids as a source of energy  <cit> , thus, any involvement of lxr in bovine mammary tissue might be at the level of fatty acid synthesis and/or inflammation   <cit> . however, the expression of lxr in bovine mammary tissue only increased slightly during lactation relative to pregnancy and it was not among deg . those responses coupled with the lack of change in lxr expression due to imi were suggestive of a minor role for lxr in mediating anti-inflammatory or lipogenic mechanisms in bovine mammary tissue.

expression of ppara is barely detectable in bovine mammary tissue  and tends to decrease during lactation, which points to a minor role of this nuclear receptor in bovine mammary lipid metabolism. we recently showed that mrna expression of pparg was consistently up-regulated during lactation, suggesting that it could play a role in milk fat synthesis  <cit> . a role of pparg in regulating bovine milk fat synthesis machinery was supported by recent results we obtained where treatment of mact cells  with rosiglitazone, a specific pparγ agonist, resulted in coordinated up-regulation of genes involved in fa import , de novo fa synthesis , and tag synthesis   <cit> . more importantly in the context of the present study, a recent study with pparγ-knockout mice indicated that its absence increased utilization of long-chain fatty acids for synthesis of inflammatory lipids due to reduced tag synthesis  <cit> . pparg-knockout mice had a sustained increase in 12-lipoxygenase  activity from parturition through the end of lactation. although we did not observe a significant effect of imi on pparg expression, up-regulation of alox5ap  might have been associated with increased synthesis of eicosanoids which are classical effectors of an inflammatory response. in addition, activation of pparγ by specific agonists reduced synthesis of inflammatory cytokines in mammary epithelial cells, suggesting this nuclear receptor has an anti-inflammatory role in mammary tissue  <cit> . a 39-fold increase of alox5ap in mammary quarters challenged with e. coli in a recent study provides further support to the inflammatory role of alox5ap during an imi  <cit> .

taken together, the above observations coupled with the down-regulation of pparγ target genes point to pparγ as a major player. the expression of this nuclear receptor appeared not to be affected by imi  but its activity probably was decreased as suggested by down-regulation of its known target genes. similar to pparα , the increase in nfκb activity might have inhibited pparγ activity. interestingly, insulin-induced gene  <dig> , which is involved in the inhibition of srebp cleavage , and appears to be a pparγ target gene in bovine mammary epithelial cells  <cit> , was significantly up-regulated . these data suggested that insig <dig> is not only under control of pparγ but likely contributed to reduced milk fat synthesis through blockage of srebp <dig> cleavage, i.e. both srebf <dig> and srebf <dig> are moderately up-regulated during lactation in bovine mammary tissue and could be involved in lipid synthesis through activation of acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase alpha  and fatty acid synthase   <cit> . unfortunately, the ipa knowledge base does not contain specific pparγ pathways, thus precluding a definitive conclusion about the pivotal role of pparγ. it is important to note that a possible role of pparα cannot be excluded because specific pparα co-activators or up-stream factors were down-regulated .

an enzyme linked to the lxr/rxr and pparg pathways via srebp <dig> in non-ruminant liver and adipose is stearoyl-coa desaturase , which plays an essential role in tag synthesis by catalyzing the synthesis of oleic acid via desaturation of stearic acid  <cit> . oleic acid serves as a primary substrate for fatty acid binding protein  <dig>   <cit> , and previous work in our laboratories proposed that fabp <dig> provides stearic acid, and other substrates, to scd, which then provides oleic acid for fabp <dig>  <cit> . expression of both fabp <dig> and fabp <dig> was down-regulated in infected versus control mammary quarters . expression of scd was also inhibited in s. uberis-infected quarters . impaired pparγ signaling might have been associated with the down-regulation of these lipogenic enzymes, either through down-regulation of srebf <dig> or directly through decreased binding to response elements .

our findings highlighted a potential relationship between ppar and lxr, two master regulators of lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in non-ruminants  <cit> . the relationships between those two nuclear receptors with inflammatory conditions appear to be in two directions, i.e. their expression/activity is decreased by inflammation in mouse liver  <cit>  and kidney  <cit> , and an increase in their activity/expression leads to an anti-inflammatory effect  <cit> . overall, our results indicated that imi with s. uberis inhibited activity of lxr/rxr and ppar signaling during imi, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of those pathways was not at play. we suggest that pparγ signaling plays a primary role in mammary tissue but the activity of this nuclear receptor was probably reduced. the overall repression of lipogenic genes in s. uberis infected mammary quarters and the mechanisms involved in lxr/rxr or ppar signaling and the fatty acid switch in the mammary gland during imi challenge have not been elucidated and require further investigation. pparγ has a pivotal role in immune cells as well, increasing their ability to face infections  <cit> . a possible role of pparγ activation in reducing inflammation in mammary gland tissue has been previously suggested based on in vitro data  <cit>  and our results support such a view.

ceramides, inflammation, and lipid metabolism
ceramide, which is involved in cell signaling, cell cycle, and regulation of protein transport from er to golgi, is one of the most studied sphingolipids in nature  <cit> . other sphingolipids with signaling roles include sphingosine  and sphingosine-1-phosphate , which can activate nfkbia and a cascade of inflammatory genes   <cit> . although minor compared with tag, sphingolipids are the third most important lipid component in bovine milk fat  <cit> . formation of the milk fat globule membrane relies on sphingolipid and cholesterol availability, thus, coordinated synthesis of both compounds is pivotal to milk lipid droplet formation/secretion. mammary tissue synthesizes sphingolipids de novo  <cit>  from palmitoyl-coa, leading to ceramide formation and incorporation into sphingomyelin. thus, palmitic acid used for ceramide synthesis in mammary appears a required step and also might represent a regulatory point for fa synthesis because ceramides can inhibit this process by blocking the activity of akt/pkb  <cit> .

our data revealed that ceramide signaling was markedly down-regulated  potentially through the action of tnf . based on the observed downregulation of lipogenic genes  as well as serine palmitoyl transferase  it was apparent that ceramide synthesis was decreased, which likely explains the down-regulation of other genes that are part of its signaling pathway . the details of the pathway indicated a reduction of ceramide synthesis from sphingomyelin through activity of neutral sphingomyelinases sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase. in addition, the decrease in expression of genes involved in long-chain fatty acids import  and de novo fatty acid synthesis  had probably reduce the amount of available palmitate for synthesis of ceramide. from our combined results, production of ceramide did not seem to be induced by pro-inflammatory state during imi, but probably decrease. in addition, we observed an overall inhibition/decrease of ceramide downstream signaling, which clearly indicated that during imi ceramide is not involved in apoptosis.

significance of the immune response and milk fat synthesis
the negative relationship between deg involved with immune response and milk fat synthesis may serve several beneficial purposes for the immune system within the mammary gland. first, the ability of phagocytes such as pmn and macrophages to engulf invading microorganisms is lower in milk when compared to pmn and macrophages that originate from the bloodstream. milk phagocytes engulf milk fat globules instead of invading pathogens, resulting in a loss of pseudopodia needed for phagocytic capability  <cit> . therefore, the less milk fat synthesized during an imi the more likely that milk phagocytes will engulf invading bacteria instead of milk fat globules. as previously stated, s. uberis strain o140j has been shown to be more resistant to pmn phagocytosis and more capable of establishing infection when compared to a noncapsular strain  <cit> . decreased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism  has also been recently reported after imi challenge with e. coli  <cit> ; and suggests that reduced lipid synthesis in the mammary gland may not be pathogen specific. in addition, microarray and qpcr analyses revealed a down-regulation of lalba , the rate limiting enzyme in lactose synthesis, which confirmed previous findings  <cit> . this may indicate that, at the time of biopsy , lactose synthesis was reduced as suggested by previously-reported milk whey analysis of mastitic cows  <cit> . a decrease in lactose synthesis might help the immune system by reducing substrate  for bacteria and also preventing a potential inhibition of pmn phagocytosis by lactose  <cit> . inflammation reduces protein synthesis in muscle  <cit> , but our transcript profiling did not indicate alterations in protein synthesis in infected compared with non-infected contralateral mammary quarters. however, there was an increase in expression of csn <dig> . furthermore, the go analysis uncovered an evident induction of transcription, post-translational modification, transport, and localization of proteins . those findings seemed to indicate that protein synthesis in milk should not have been decreased, but the large increase in transcription and protein metabolism was probably more related to increase synthesis and secretion of inflammatory-related proteins such as cytokines or acute-phase proteins. unfortunately, quarter milk composition was not analyzed during the infection period; therefore, changes in milk fat, protein, and lactose could not be evaluated.

milk fat synthesis down-regulated deg
the majority of deg down-regulated by > <dig> -fold  in mammary quarters after imi challenge with s. uberis were associated with lipid metabolism including lipoprotein lipase , cd <dig>  lipin  <dig> , and butyrophilin  . however, the changes in gene expression were not as marked as those observed for up-regulated deg. swanson et al.  <cit>  also reported down-regulation of genes involved with lipid metabolism  in bovine mammary tissue after imi with s. uberis. this is further supported by günther et al.  <cit> , who observed a decrease in mrna expression of factors associated with lipid metabolism  such as lpl, fasn and btn1a <dig> after imi challenge with e. coli. exogenous sources of non-esterified fatty acids  and tag in the circulation that are used for milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland originate from 1) chylomicra from dietary sources that enter the lymphatics and bypass the liver; 2) very low-density lipoproteins  that are exported from the liver; or 3) nefa bound to albumin that originate from adipose tissue  <cit> . the vldl and chylomicra attach to the mammary endothelium by the enzyme lpl, which then hydrolyzes tg to fatty acids. our results indicated that lpl was the third most down-regulated gene with a - <dig> -fold change in expression versus control quarters . this enzyme is located functionally in the capillaries, but is synthesized in parenchymal cells. recent work in our laboratories has shown that lpl highest fold change in expression occurs during peak lactation  when compared to prepartum expression values  <cit> . evidence also suggests a role for the vldl receptor  in lpl activity  <cit> , tag metabolism and storage in adipocytes  <cit> , and positive relationships with lpl expression during early lactation  <cit> .

another highly deg during infection was cd <dig> . this gene is highly expressed during early lactation in mammary tissue  <cit>  and plays a role in fatty acid transport  across the plasma membrane of mec, thus providing fatty acid for milk fat synthesis. genes involved in tag synthesis in the mammary gland, lpin <dig> and gpam  were significantly down-regulated. lpin <dig> had the greatest fold change in expression  out of all deg down-regulated in mammary from s. uberis-infected quarters.

the transport and export of newly-synthesized milk fat droplets is accomplished via btn1a <dig>  xanthine dehydrogenase , and adipophilin   <cit> . during early lactation, positive associations between btn1a <dig>  xdh, and adfp were observed in healthy bovine mammary tissue  <cit> . interestingly, these genes were found to have contrasting expression patterns during imi with s. uberis. within infected quarters, btn1a <dig> was one of the top down-regulated genes  and xdh had modest down-regulation  when compared to control quarters. furthermore, xdh can be converted to xanthine oxidase  by reversible sulfhydryl oxidation or by irreversible proteolytic modification  <cit> . production of xo is important for bactericidal activity against major bovine mammary gland pathogens including e. coli and staph. aureus  <cit> . the specific response of bacteria species to xo and the resulting bacteria-dependent nitrosative stress demonstrated that, besides its central role in lipid droplet secretion, xdh plays a role in the mammary gland immune system  <cit> . the up-regulation of adfp might have been a compensatory mechanism to sustain milk lipid droplet secretion. further investigation is required to determine the specific role of lipid droplet proteins during imi.

glucocorticoid signaling and related pathways
glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones, exert dramatic effects on metabolism and immune response during periods of stress and lead to catabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins while increasing glucose availability in the bloodstream  <cit> . glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor α  activating it. the activated glucocorticoid receptor inhibits inflammation through transcriptional repression of proinflammatory genes  <cit>  and activates genes involved in the anti-inflammatory response  and apoptosis   <cit> . despite lower mrna for nr3c <dig> during infection , we observed up-regulation of anxa <dig> . there was also a tendency towards an increase in expression of bax .

the glucocorticoid signaling through glucocorticoid receptor is related to erk/mapk and pi3k/akt  <cit> . even though those pathways were overall likely induced by  <dig> h of imi, the genes  which are related those pathways were down-regulated. erk/mapk signaling seems to be essential for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids via repression of p <dig> mapk upon glucocorticoid treatment in mice  <cit> . evidence of a modulatory effect of glucocorticoids on erk/mapk signaling pathways have been reported for human cancer cells  <cit> . interestingly, in our case we observed a down-regulation of most of the genes coding for kinases . explanations for the down-regulation of kinases in the erk/mapk  are not readily available. the pi3k/akt is essential in the activation of nfκb by tnf  <cit> , thus playing an inflammatory role in the tissue. in our case the details of the pathway indicate that the pi3k/akt signaling was in favor of nfκb mediated transcription probably though induction by growth factors, while other down-stream effects were mostly inhibited . based on the evident induction of proliferation and apoptosis, suggested by functional analysis  and details of the pi3k/akt pathway, we can conclude that the likely induction of pi3k/akt pathway is probably related to proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. the down-regulation of several genes in common with the glucocorticoid pathway seems to indicate that the relationship among those pathways is not playing a role in modulating inflammation at  <dig> h post-inoculation.

leukocyte extravasation and pain are transcriptionally regulated after imi
the nervous system was not highly affected when considering functional analyses in ipa  or go ; however, several pathways involved in neuronal outgrowth appeared significantly inhibited including ephrin receptor, axonal guidance, and cdk <dig> signaling . most of those pathways are not strictly related to neurons.

ephrin receptor signaling plays a role in attraction/repulsion, adhesion/de-adhesion implicated in axon guidance and migration of other cells beside neurons  but also plays a role in angiogenesis and synaptic plasticity. it has been suggested, based on multiple lines of evidence, that ephrin receptors play a direct role on inflammatory response  <cit> . the evidence points to a dual-phase pattern. in the early phase of inflammatory response the ephrin pathway is activated, inducing a decrease in adhesion between endothelial cells and epithelial cells. in a subsequent phase of inflammatory response the pathway is inhibited, increasing adhesion of circulating leukocytes to vascular endothelium and to epithelia of internal organs. the combination of the two allows the extravasation of leukocytes. based on these effects, the evident inhibition of ephrin receptor signaling in our data  seems to indicate that at  <dig> h the inflammatory response was on its second phase, i.e. namely the adhesion and extravasation of leukocytes. similar conclusions could be drawn from the axonal guidance signaling, which shares many of the ephrin receptor pathway molecular networks . the importance of movement and invasion of leukocytes and cell regulation of cell adhesion was underscored also by functional analysis .

the cdk <dig> signaling is strictly related to neuronal physiology  <cit>  and seems to participate in dendrite and synapse development  <cit> , but also in nociception  <cit> . the nociceptive role of cdk <dig> signaling has been clearly demonstrated during induction of peripheral inflammation in mouse. during an inflammatory status, or other sort of pain, the level of calpains increases rendering the cdk <dig> more stable, a process which seems to increase the perception of pain  <cit> . based on those previous results, the strong inhibition of cdk <dig> signaling at  <dig> h of imi  seems to indicate a degree of modulation or control of pain through decrease nociception within mammary tissue prior peak clinical signs of infection.

gene networks during imi challenge with s. uberis
genes positively-associated with tnf
not surprisingly, tnf was positively associated with pro-inflammatory mediators such as il <dig>  il1b, and nfkbia. the positive association with the anti-inflammatory cytokine il <dig> further supports the co-regulatory mechanisms responsible for controlling the severity of the inflammatory response during an imi  <cit> .

the network in figure  <dig> also shows a positive effect of tnf on the acute-phase protein saa <dig>  this supports the protein-level response observed in milk secretions from cows during imi challenge with s. uberis, where milk saa concentrations were elevated at  <dig> h post-inoculation when compared to pre-inoculation concentrations  <cit> . serum amyloid proteins have immunological properties and the saa <dig> isoform  has been shown to be highly expressed in bovine mec during mastitis  <cit> . expression of mrna for saa <dig> in mec is significantly enhanced in quarters challenged with lps from e. coli or with staph. aureus when compared to healthy quarters, indicating that the main source of saa in milk during infection may be from mec and not hepatocytes  <cit> . this premise is further supported by results of eckersall et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that expression of m-saa <dig> mrna and haptoglobin  mrna were up-regulated during an experimental challenge with staph. aureus and that mrna for m-saa <dig> was greater than that for hp. this increased expression of saa <dig> and hp is specific to infected quarters because several studies have indicated that expression is minimal or not detectable in mec from healthy quarters  <cit> . it is challenging to be able to distinguish between  <dig> gene isoforms with a 70-bp oligonucleotide on a microarray platform. the latest annotation of our microarray identified this oligo as both saa <dig> and saa <dig> and it clearly depends on the tissue type  as to which isoform is primarily expressed. upon verification, we confirmed that the sequencing results of primers were specific for saa <dig> . ipa network analysis indicated that tnf-α protein has been shown to increase saa <dig> mrna expression in mouse granulosa cells  <cit>  and in 3t3-l <dig> adipocyte cell lines  <cit> . saa is primarily involved in the acute phase response and has been shown to increase leukocyte adhesion  <cit> , but no relationships between saa <dig> and genes encoding sell and selectin-p  have been identified . however, tnf has been shown to affect both the expression and protein release of selp, but not sell, in murine endothelial cells   <cit> .

gene network analysis also shows that tnf has a positive relationship with plau and plaur. the enzyme plau is required for the normal repair of wounds originating on skin  <cit>  and, as stated earlier, s. uberis can activate the conversion of plau to plasmin  <cit> . plasmin increases during mastitis and hydrolyzes αs-casein, β-casein, and β-casein  <cit> . an increase in expression of κ -casein  was observed in s. uberis infected quarters . concentrations of κ-casein and plasmin were not quantified in milk secretions from infected quarters for this study, thus further research will be needed to investigate their correlations between mrna expression and protein concentrations in milk as well as their specificity to s. uberis-associated mastitis.

in the nucleus, both fos and bcl <dig> expression are stimulated by tnf . expression of fos was enhanced in human omental microvascular endothelial cells when incubated with tnf-α for  <dig> min  <cit> , whereas bcl <dig>  a nuclear protein primarily found in b lymphocytes, increased when human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines  were stimulated with tnf-α  <cit> . another positive association within the network involved ltf, which competes for iron with invading microorganisms that require it for growth  <cit> . watanabe et al.  <cit>  observed a significant increase in ltf  <dig> h after intramammary infusion of recombinant bovine tnf-α.

increased cd <dig> and tlr <dig> expression was observed in s. uberis-infected quarters when compared to healthy  quarters . hermoso et al.  <cit>  observed an increase in tlr <dig> mrna expression in carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells  after stimulation with recombinant human tnf-α. regarding cd <dig>  tnf-α protein increased cd <dig> expression in rat kupffer cells  <cit> . the cd <dig> molecule is primarily activated via the pamp sequence associated with gram-negative bacteria   <cit> , but it has been shown to increase in gram-positive associated imi  <cit> .

genes negatively-associated with tnf
as discussed above, several genes involved in milk fat synthesis were down-regulated in s. uberis-infected quarters. network analysis by ipa indicated that the products of cd <dig>  gpam, fabp <dig>  lpin <dig>  lpl, and scd, known to be involved in milk fat synthesis  <cit> , were negatively-associated with the expression of tnf. it has been demonstrated that tnf reduces expression of lpl in rat adipocytes  <cit> ; gpam in mouse adipocytes  <cit> , and cd <dig>  fabp <dig>  and scd in adipocytes from human, mouse, or rat  <cit> . most researchers examining gene expression responses after imi challenge have primarily focused on genes involved with the immune response, and very few studies  <cit>  have examined large-scale gene expression profiles in the mammary gland during an imi challenge with s. uberis. this research provides evidence of a role for tnf in modulation of milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland during an imi.

CONCLUSIONS
our study indicated that imi challenge with s. uberis  elicited a strong transcriptomic response, leading to an overall up-regulation of genes involved in the innate immune response. results provided additional information into the early response factors associated with the innate immune response to s. uberis infection. although the degree of down-regulation among deg during imi challenge was not as marked , it was interesting that the majority of these genes were associated with lipid metabolism and, particularly, milk fat synthesis. pathway analysis suggested an inhibitory effect of imi on lxr and ppar signaling . the latter may provide a mechanistic explanation for the inverse relationship between immune response and milk fat synthesis. this finding deserves more attention due to the possibility of manipulating ppar signaling through diet.

milk composition analysis would be useful in the future to relate with mammary gene expression changes during an imi. the growing amount of information regarding differences in mammary response to major mastitis-causing pathogens such as e. coli, staph. aureus, and s. uberis has provided researchers with new insights into the transcriptomic mechanisms involved in immune response and metabolism during an imi. mechanisms involved in the immune response to these invading microorganisms warrant further investigation.
