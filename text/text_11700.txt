BACKGROUND
the guanine protein coupled receptor  family is one of the largest receptor groups in vertebrates. members of this family are also present in unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast and in plants which suggests that they are of ancient origin  <cit> . in the human genome, gpcrs account for approximately 2% of the coding genes  <cit>  and they bind structurally diverse ligands such as protons, odorants, biogenic amines, peptides and glycoproteins  <cit> . recent analysis of the human genome identified five main gpcr subfamilies collectively known as grafs   <cit> . this grouping was based on protein motifs characterised by the presence of seven highly conserved transmembrane domains . several authors have proposed the existence of a common ancestral gene in early metazoans that, as a consequence of successive duplication events, generated the full complement of family members in vertebrates  <cit> . such a proposal is in general agreement with the genome duplication theories of haldane  <dig>  <cit> , muller  <dig>  <cit>  and ohno  <dig>  <cit> . all of which suggest that the existence of gene family members in chordates is a consequence of genome duplication events in the vertebrate lineage during evolution and that gene duplicates are an essential source of organism diversity.

the present work focuses on the secretin family  of gpcrs which represent one of the largest receptor families for hormones and neuropeptides involved in several important biological functions. previous in silico analysis identified a total of  <dig> family  <dig> gpcr members in the human genome  <cit> . however only receptor members of the following groups: a) corticotrophin releasing factor ; b) secretin , vasoactive intestinal peptide , pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide  and growth hormone releasing hormone ; c) glucagon , glucagon-like peptide , glucose insulinotropic peptide ; d) parathyroid hormone  and e) calcitonin  and calcitonin gene-related peptide   <cit>  have been functionally characterised and identified in other vertebrates such as birds, amphibians and teleosts  <cit> . so far, in invertebrates putative family  <dig> gpcrs have been found based upon sequence similarity and phylogenetic studies . gene family members were characterised in protostome  and tunicate  genomes and compared with their vertebrate homologues . putative family  <dig> gpcr receptor members were identified and isolated in silico from public genome databases and their expression analysed by rt-pcr. the gene structures and gene environments vis Ã  vis gene content of the protostome and deuterostome receptors were compared and a model for the evolution of family  <dig> gpcr receptors is proposed.

RESULTS
putative family  <dig> gpcrs in invertebrates
initially, three, five and nine putative family  <dig> gpcr genes were identified respectively in the protostome genomes of the nematodes , the arthropods  and in the deuterostome genome of the tunicate c. intestinalis. with the exception of the c.briggsae and mosquito receptor genes, the protostome and tunicate predicted gene sequences were edited taking into consideration est data available in order to minimise errors derived from in silico gene predictions . sequence comparison and other in silico approaches revealed that of these genes, only two in the nematodes, three in the fruit-fly, one gene in the mosquito and eight in the ciona genome contained seven tm domains and were considered to be putative family  <dig> gpcrs members . database searches carried out in the prokaryote e. coli and the unicellular eukaryote s. cerevisae genomes did not produce any significant alignments for family  <dig> receptor genes.

names of the protostomes and tunicate receptor clones identified by sequence similarity searches using the vertebrate family  <dig> gpcrs  does not have  <dig> tm domains;  tm <dig> was not identified;  incomplete

phylogenetic analysis
because of gaps and errors in draft genome data, only  <dig> tms were used in the full analysis: tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> which were found to be common to all metazoan genes analysed . the amino acid sequences of the tm domains of a total of  <dig> receptors were concatenated and aligned using the clustalx programme . the alignment produced  did not required the insertion of gaps and was used for phylogenetic analysis and the consensus tree obtained is presented on figure  <dig>  family  <dig> gpcr members are suggested to have evolved via both late and early gene duplication events, which have occurred during metazoan evolution. examples of specific gene duplication events which are well supported by the high bootstrap values of the tree nodes are the ciona gene pair cins5a/cins5b, cins372/cins <dig> and the gene pair cins50/cins <dig>  after neighbour joining, maximum parsimony and minimum evolution phylogenetic analysis, the protostome receptors and ciona cins <dig>  cins <dig> and cins <dig> genes tended to cluster with the deuterostome crf and cal/cgrp receptor family members. in ciona orthologues of the majority of the vertebrate family members such as cins <dig> and cins <dig> group with the ptr receptor subfamily, whilst cins5a, cins5b and cins <dig> genes seem to be more related in sequence to the gcg/glp/gip and pac/vpac/ghrh families however cins5a and cins5b position in the tree was not clearly defined.

sequence comparative analyses
comparison of the amino acid sequences of the putative protostome and tunicate receptors with the vertebrate homologues revealed the existence of conserved amino acid motifs at the ligand-binding n-terminal region . large n-terminal regions containing five conserved cysteines were identified in all species analysed with the exception of the ciona cins <dig> and cins <dig> genes which due to incomplete genome coverage and est data available lacked complete n-terminal regions and cins <dig> where the putative initial methionine was not identified. other highly conserved amino acid residues such as the amino acid aspartate  before the motif c-w-p and the amino acid motifs c-w-p, c-p and g-x-w    <cit>  were also identified. moreover, the amino acid glycine  localised between this latter motif and the c-p motif was also found to be conserved amongst metazoans however no functional role for this residue has been yet assigned.

to strengthen previous analysis and in order to identify novel amino acid and protein motifs that have been conserved within each receptor subfamily, members that might have a potential role in ligand binding in the protostome and deuterostome n-terminal regions of the receptors were compared based on receptor clustering groups previously obtained by phylogentic analysis. putative protostome and tunicate members of the cal/cgrp, crf, pth and cgc/glp/gip receptor families were aligned with the vertebrate homologue receptor genes . examples of novel conserved n-terminal protein motifs identified are the w-s/t-n-y/f motif in cal/cgrp receptors alignment ; the motif g-v/i-x-y  within crf receptor group  which has been previously reported to be involved in ligand binding  <cit> ; the motifs e-w, p-g; y-i-y/i-d-f-d/n-h and a-x-r  in the ptr group and amino acid hsaptr <dig> r  <dig> which was previously found to be determinant for pth binding  <cit>  and the motif y-l/i-p/e-w within gcg/glp/gip receptor group .

short-range linkage mapping analysis
short-range linkage analysis was carried out between the protostome  with the deuterostome  homologous regions which contain family  <dig> receptor genes. the linked genes identified in both c. elegans and takifugu were used to identify homologous genes in the drosophila  and human  genomes. the protostome gene environment was found to be conserved and linked genes were identified between the nematode and insect genomes. the drosophila x chromosome and chromosome iii of c. elegans showed the greatest number of linked genes. within the protostome genome three genes namely 3h <dig>  clp- <dig> and him- <dig> in c. elegans were also found to be conserved in the homologous deuterostomes genome regions analysed . a number of takifugu scaffolds were found to share a similar gene environment with c. elegans chromosomes ii and x, and human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  this suggests that the nematode chromosome regions may be very similar in terms of gene content with the ancestral chromosomal region that gave rise to this family of receptors in vertebrates .

gene organisation in protostomes and deuterostomes
the gene organisation of the regions encompassing the seven tm domains of the protostome and tunicate family  <dig> gpcr genes were characterised and compared with the vertebrate human and takifugu homologous regions . different gene structures were observed between protostomes and deuterostomes. this was mainly due to an increase in intron number in the latter species. comparison of exon/intron boundaries revealed total conservation of splice sites  although intron phases are generally poorly conserved with the exception of the tm <dig> and tm <dig> boundary .

amongst protostome family  <dig> gpcr genes, organisation is poorly conserved. in nematodes two different gene organisations were identified for the receptors celc13b <dig> /cbrcae <dig>  and celc18b <dig> /cbrcae <dig> , respectively. in the drosophila genome, a different gene organisation also exists for each of the three receptor genes analysed. tm <dig> and tm <dig> in the drosophila genes dmecg <dig> and dmecg <dig>  in common with the nematode, tunicate and vertebrate receptors, are encoded by individual exons. the dmecg <dig> gene has the most divergent gene structure amongst protostomes and is composed of  <dig> exons. in mosquito, the gene structure of agensangp <dig>  is similar to dmecg <dig> with which it share greatest sequence similarity.

in contrast with protostomes, two main gene structures were characterised in deuterostomes with tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> domains shared between two exons. in human and takifugu, the cal and cgrp receptors genes form a separate group with a different gene organisation from the other receptor genes. these receptors seem to have lost an intron between the exons that contain part of tm <dig> and tm <dig> and part of tm <dig> respectively and are composed of  <dig> exons with identical intron phases. the ciona cins5a, cins5b, cins <dig> and cins <dig> receptor genes are also shorter and composed by  <dig> exons. with the exception of the cal and cgrp receptors all human and takifugu family  <dig> genes and ciona cins <dig>  cins <dig>  cins <dig> and cins <dig> receptors are composed of  <dig> exons and share identical intron phases.

expression analysis
rt-pcr with specific primers for each receptor gene was carried out using total rna extracted from whole adult c. elegans, drosophila, mosquito and ciona . the nematode receptor genes celc18b <dig>  and celc13b <dig> , the drosophila dmecg <dig>  dmecg <dig> and dmecg <dig> were successfully amplified. the tissue distribution was refined in ciona with expression analyses carried out in the intestine, pharyngeal basket, gonads, endostyle and cerebral ganglion. the putative family  <dig> gpcr encoded by cins <dig>  was expressed in all tissues analysed, but was mainly present in the intestine, gonads and cerebral ganglion. the cins5a gene expression had a similar tissue distribution to cins <dig>  however its duplicate, cins5b had a more limited distribution and was only expressed in the intestine. the receptors cins <dig> and cins <dig> were only expressed in gonad and cerebral ganglion tissue, whilst cins <dig> was expressed in the endostyle. cins <dig> was restricted to the ovary where it was weakly expressed. it was not possible to amplify agensangp <dig> and cins <dig> receptors.

discussion
in total  <dig> putative family  <dig> gpcr members were identified and characterised in the protostome and in the tunicate genome using the human and takifugu tm domain sequences. in the human genome a total of  <dig> family  <dig> gpcr receptors have been described  <cit> ) although ligands have only been assigned for  <dig> family  <dig> gpcr members  <cit> . the evolution of this latter receptor group is the major subject of this study.

to avoid the inclusion of potential intronic regions which could bias analysis, the invertebrate genes were manually edited using expression data available and sequence similarity for the homologue genes and the in silico analysis performed was restricted for receptor conserved motifs at n-terminal and tm domains. the putative invertebrate receptors identified share the general characteristics of family  <dig> gpcr members with the presence of conserved cysteine residues  <cit>  and several highly conserved amino acids and protein motifs at the n-terminal domain which is involved in ligand binding  <cit> . analysis of unicellular organism genomes such as the prokaryote e. coli and the eukaryote s. cerevisae failed to reveal any putative family  <dig> receptor genes suggesting that these receptor genes are characteristic of metazoan genomes.

the protostome genes identified are more like the vertebrate cal/cgrp and crf receptors subfamilies suggesting that ancestral family  <dig> gpcr members were most like these genes. in vertebrates these receptors are associated with calcium homeostasis and the stress axis respectively, and appropriate functioning is essential for survival  <cit> . no studies are available describing the role of these receptors in protostomes and their classification was based upon their sequence similarity, so they may not be functional orthologues. recently, expression studies carried out using the drosophila dmecg <dig> and dmecg <dig>  receptor genes, which are very similar in sequence to the vertebrate crf and cal/cgrp receptors, respectively, were indeed found to be functional orthologues. these studies revealed that dmecg <dig> and dmcg <dig> in the presence of insect diuretic hormones  were functional and activate a similar intracellular signalling pathway to the vertebrate receptor genes  <cit> .

it is generally accepted that complexity of vertebrates and the origin and development of physiological systems is a consequence of the acquisition of new genes by gene or exon duplications that occurred during chordate evolution . the occurrence of an organised brain and complex central nervous structure is only present in vertebrates. in the majority of protostomes and early deuterostomes the nervous system is mainly characterised by the presence of simple structures such as cerebral and head ganglions to which several nerve networks are connected and like the gastroenteropancreatic system it has been evolving by varying degrees of complexity throughout metazoan evolution  <cit> .

the existence of an increasing gene number of family  <dig> gpcr members in the metazoan lineage clearly suggests that evolution of this gene family results from a series of duplications. several gene duplication events have been proposed to have occurred in chordate genomes. however if they are a consequence of two total genome duplication events  or a result of independent single gene duplications  is still under debate. the 2r theory has been generally accepted to justify the presence of gene family members and novel genes in higher vertebrate genomes when compared with early chordate and invertebrate species. family  <dig> gpcr members have been identified in the majority of vertebrate genomes  <cit>  and searches carried out on the amphibian and chicken genomes identified an equivalent number of gene family members  to that found in the human genome. in particular putative sct receptor genes, lacking in teleost genomes, were identified as previously described by langerstrom et al  <cit> . the absence of an equivalent sct receptor sequence in teleosts but its identification in amphibian and avian genomes may indicate that this receptor either, i) arose after the divergence of the fishes or, ii) was lost in the fish lineage and studies on ancient fishes  should help to clarify this issue.

the protostome receptors contain the most divergent gene structures when compared with those of deuterostomes . this is probably a consequence of the higher rate of chromosomal and gene rearrangements when compared to early chordates and vertebrates  <cit> . the reason behind differences in intron numbers between protostomes and deuterostomes remains to be established. the precursor gene in urbilateria  remains to be identified and therefore the difference in intron numbers can be explained either by intron gain during metazoan evolution after the divergence of the protostome and deuterostome  <cit>  or by intron loss in the protostome lineage  <cit> . interestingly, the vertebrate cal and cgrp receptor gene organisation is more like the tunicate receptors than other vertebrate family  <dig> members and the way in which these receptors function is also different. accessory single transmembrane proteins  interact with both cal and cgrp receptors and alter their affinity profile for the ligands   <cit> . in fact cal receptor-ramp heterodimerazation is essential for receptor function but not for the other family  <dig> members  <cit> . it remains to be established if such functional constraints can influence gene evolution and in particular cal/cgrp receptors gene evolution.

expression analyses indicates that with the exception of the single mosquito receptor and cins <dig>  all protostome and tunicate genes are expressed. in general, the tissue distribution of the ciona receptors mirrors the expression of the vertebrate family  <dig> gpcrs sequence homologues. for example, the duplicate cins5a and cins5b receptors and cins <dig> which share sequence similarity for the vertebrate brain-gut peptide gcg, glp, gip receptors were found to be expressed in ciona intestine, gonads and neural ganglion suggesting that like the vertebrate homologues they may also have a role in the gastrointestinal, reproductive and nervous systems  <cit> . the function of the vertebrate receptors in the reproductive system is not clear, but in the nervous and gastrointestinal systems they are involved in carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism  <cit> . it remains to be established if the tunicate receptors localised in these tissue have a similar functional role.

the ciona cal/cgrp  homologue was only expressed in the endostyle whilst the tunicate ptr-like receptor homologue  was present in the neural ganglion and the gonads. in vertebrates these receptors are found to have an important role in the endocrine regulation of calcium mediated by cal and pth hormones  <cit> . the presence in ciona of the vertebrate homologue receptors may suggest that elements of calcium homeostasis are conserved between tunicates and vertebrates. moreover, the expression of cins <dig> in ciona endostyle, the homologue of the vertebrate thyroid gland, the site of cal production  <cit> , further supports this hypothesis. the cins <dig> and cins <dig> are the sequence homologues of the vertebrate crf receptors, which are mainly associated with stress response  <cit> . in vertebrates both receptors are found to be expressed in nervous tissue and crf <dig> receptor was also found in the gonads and crf <dig> receptor in the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . the pattern of expression of the tunicate cins <dig> and cins <dig> was similar and both receptors were expressed in the gonads whilst cins <dig> was further detected in the neural ganglion suggesting they may also play a functional role in the nervous and reproductive systems in tunicates. functional and ligand-binding studies are required to characterise the physiological role of the tunicate receptors. moreover, the isolation and characterisation of their putative ligand peptides which have yet to be comprehensively described will be essential to understanding of their function.

the evolution of family  <dig> gpcr receptor genes in protostomes and deuterostomes is probably the result of a combination of species-specific gene duplications and gene or genome duplication events in ancestral gene precursors . for example, the drosophila dmecg <dig> and dmecg <dig> map to chromosome 2r and share a similar gene organisation. this suggests that they arose by a specific gene duplication event. based on their sequence similarity, gene organisation and intron phases, the drosophila dmecg <dig> and dmecg <dig> receptor genes appear to be the orthologues of the nematode celc13b <dig>  and ciona cins50/cins <dig> and cins <dig> receptors, respectively. in tunicates,  <dig> different family  <dig> gpcr ancestral gene precursors probably existed: the gene precursor for cins50/cins <dig>  the gene precursor for cins <dig> and a common gene precursor for cins70/cins5a/cins5b/cins372/cins <dig>  these are proposed to be the origin of the vertebrate crf, cal/cgrp genes and remaining deuterostome family  <dig> gpcrs, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
putative family  <dig> receptor genes were isolated and characterised from a number of different invertebrate genomes. this study provides for the first time a comprehensive description of the gene sequence, structure and expression of family  <dig> gpcrs members in invertebrates providing important clues about their origin and evolution along the metazoan divergence. the cal/cgrp and crf receptors are proposed to be the first family  <dig> members to evolve in contrast to sct receptors which seem to have evolved much later and are only present in tetrapods. studies such as this, can via a mixture of in vitro and in silico approaches, contribute to a better understanding of gene regulation in vertebrates.
