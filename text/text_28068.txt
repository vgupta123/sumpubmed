BACKGROUND
although the stem cell concept was introduced decades ago, to date, stem cells can only be defined functionally, not morphologically or phenotypically. two functions define stem cells. firstly, they are self-renewing, thus able to propagate to generate additional stem cells. secondly they can differentiate into various progenitor cells, which commit to further maturation along a specific lineage. while stem cells can be best defined functionally, a good number of molecular markers have been used to prospectively identify various stem cell populations. although the functional importance of many of these antigens remains unknown, their unique expression pattern and timing of expression provide a useful tool for scientists to identify as well as isolate stem cells.

embryonic stem cells , derived from the inner cell mass of pre-implantation embryos, have been recognized as the earliest stem cell population  <cit> . this pluripotent population can differentiate into all somatic tissue including germ cells. in the case of human esc, they can differentiate into some extra-embryonic derivatives as well. like mouse esc, human es cells can be maintained and propagated on mouse fibroblast feeders for extended periods in media containing basic fibroblast growth factor   <cit> . gene expression of undifferentiated human es cells has been investigated among several es cell lines by a variety of techniques. they include comparison with databases, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, focused cdna microarrays, and immunocytochemistry. a list of molecules comprised of known es-specific or -highly expressed genes and candidates that can serve as markers for human escs and may also contribute to the "stemness" phenotype has been established  <cit> . for example, pluripotent esc can be characterized by high level expression of oct3/ <dig>  and nanog, which are a member of pou domain and homeobox transcription factors respectively. a critical amount of oct3/ <dig> and nanog expression is required to sustain stem-cell pluripotency and both of these markers are downregulated as cells differentiate in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . antibodies to oct3/ <dig> which cross react with human oct 3/ <dig> have been widely used to monitor the presence of undifferentiated esc.

no single marker however is sufficient or unique for identifying escs. oct3/ <dig> for example is expressed by germ cells and may be expressed by specific populations later in development. likewise, nanog has been shown to express in other tissues. we and other have noted however, that while no single marker is sufficient a constellation of positive and negative markers can in concert unambiguously allow one to define the state of esc cultures and that surface markers in combination can be used to prospectively sort for esc.

based on published data at the level of gene expression, we have cloned a number of candidate marker genes. we have also expressed the recombinant protein and generated a panel of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to these proteins. using these antibodies we have confirmed the specificity and selectivity of these antibodies on several esc lines and established their utility as stem cells markers. our results confirm the expression pattern and timing of these cell markers at the protein level, whereas previous data reported at the level of gene expression.

RESULTS
characterization of undifferentiated human es cells and differentiated ebs by antibodies
all monoclonal antibodies were initially selected for their abilities to recognize recombinant proteins in direct elisas. a subset were also tested by western blot analysis using recombinant proteins and cell lysate to confirm binding to a single epitope. the best clone was later screened for its applications for immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry using various cell lines. human peripheral blood platelets were used for screening mouse anti-human cd <dig> antibody. mcf- <dig> cells were used for screening mouse anti-human e-cadherin and podxl  antibodies. mg- <dig> cells were used for screening mouse anti-human gata <dig>  antibody. beta-tc <dig> cells were used for screening for mouse anti-human/mouse pdx- <dig>  antibody. ntera- <dig> cells were used for screening mouse anti-human oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  antibodies. all polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified using recombinant proteins and validated by direct elisas and western. caco- <dig> cells were used for validation of goat anti-human gata <dig> antibody and ntera- <dig> cells were used for validation of goat anti-human nanog and anti-human oct3/ <dig> antibodies .

n/a:  <dig>  dppa <dig> is still being subcloned. only elisa verification is available.

 <dig>  the clone for gata- <dig>  does not work for western blot application but is useful for ihc, the clone picked for western blot analysis does not work for ihc .

after antibodies were validated in direct elisas, western blot or cell lines , they were used to examine the expression of individual molecules in undifferentiated human es cells and differentiated ebs. when examined by immunohistochemistry, high level of expressions of oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  e-cadherin, podxl and nanog were observed in undifferentiated human es cells . dppa <dig>  expression was also observed in undifferentiated human es cells . we noted that a subset of the proteins used were membrane bound proteins. to test if any of the antibodies generated could recognize an extracellular epitope and thus be used for live cell sorting, we repeated staining of live cells as previously described. the cd <dig>  e-cadherin and podxl antibodies recognized an extracellular epitope and their ability to select cells by facs was confirmed . minimal or no expressions of oct3/ <dig>  e-cadherin, podxl and nanog were detected in the differentiated ebs . however, sox <dig> expression, which is observed in neural progenitor cells, is persistent in subsets of ebs.

suspension culture with fgf withdrawal is known to induce differentiation of es cells to all three germ layer precursors  <cit> . the differentiation status of the eb used here was detected to contain all germ cell markers by rt-pcr . in order to examine how more antibodies can be used for characterization of early differentiation events from human es cells, we examined the expressions of endodermal markers, sox <dig>  gata <dig> and pdx- <dig>  and mesodermal markers, brachyury and gata <dig>  in the undifferentiated human es cells and differentiated ebs. expressions of sox <dig>  gata <dig>  pdx- <dig>  brachyury and gata <dig> were not detected in undifferentiated human es cells . in contrast to the undifferentiated es cells, subpopulations of sox17-, gata6-, brachyury- and gata1-positive cells were observed . these results suggest that both endodermal and mesodermal precursors exist in ebs with fgf withdrawal for  <dig> days. however, no pdx-1-positive cells were seen in ebs differentiated with the same treatment .

examination of cross-reactivity of antibodies on mouse es and differentiated cells
we have also examined the cross-reactivities of these antibodies to mouse es cells using mouse d <dig> es cell line and mouse fetal endodermal tissue. cross-reactivity to mouse of goat anti-oct3/ <dig>  goat anti-pdx- <dig>  goat anti-sox <dig> and mouse anti-sox <dig> was detected. minimal cross-reactivity to mouse, measured by 10% intensity to human by higher than control cells, was observed in mouse anti-cd <dig> and mouse anti-e-cadherin antibodies. goat anti-nanog and mouse anti-podxl antibodies appear to be human-specific as well . the subtypes of monoclonal antibodies were also identified in the best clones. these results are summarized in table  <dig> 

*nt, not tested; nd, not determined.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression patterns detected using antibodies developed in our facility are consistent with data reported using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or cdna microarrays. moreover several of the monoclonal antibodies have differing heavy chain subunits allowing double labeling using subtype specific markers to be performed.

in summary, we have developed a useful collection of antibodies that would be useful for identification of stem cell characteristics and assessment of differentiation. several additional antibodies to the molecules that have been identified as potential cell lineage markers  <cit>  are currently under development using the same approach.
