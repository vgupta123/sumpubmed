BACKGROUND
topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that alter dna topology by cleavage and religation of the dna. human topoisomerase ii exists as two isoforms, known as topoisomerase iiα  and topoisomerase iiβ , which are essential for a number of nuclear processes, including chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and relief of torsional stress during dna replication and transcription  <cit> . these topoisomerases have been shown to be targeted by common anti-cancer drugs known as topoisomerase poisons, including acridines, anthracyclines, and actinomycins as they stabilize the enzyme-mediated double-stranded breaks in the dna  <cit> . drug sensitivity to the topoisomerase ii poisons is dependent on high levels of topoisomerase ii in addition to the presence of the drug, while drug resistance has been correlated with low levels of the enzyme. doxorubicin has been shown to be most effective when cells are rapidly proliferating and expressing high levels of topoisomerase iiα, the critical nuclear enzyme in maintaining correct dna topology, which is vital for cell function and survival. many factors have been implicated in the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs but the down-regulation of topoisomerase ii is believed to be an important mechanism underlying the acquired drug resistance  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms linking drug treatment and down-regulation of topoisomerase ii expression are incompletely understood. for example it is not known whether the down-regulation of topoisomerase ii expression is the result of early changes in expression of key transcription factors or more subtle effects that occur over a longer time course.

the human topoisomerase iiα promoter has five functional ccaat boxes  and two gc boxes  <cit> . ccaat boxes are customarily flanked by at least one functionally important promoter element. in the case of the human topoisomerase iiα promoter icb <dig> and icb <dig> are flanked by gc <dig> and gc <dig> respectively. gc boxes are the second most frequent element in promoters and tend to be present in multiple copies. in promoters where multiple gc boxes are present, it is common for each gc box to have a different function according to its position with respect to the transcription start point and other flanking elements.

within the human topoisomerase iiα promoter, gc <dig> is contained in the minimal promoter  <cit> , whereas gc <dig> is distal to this region. mutations in gc <dig> have shown no marked decrease in topoisomerase iiα activity, however in resistant cells a mutation in gc <dig> has been shown to increase promoter activity .

although some promoters have multiple gc boxes, it has been shown that a single sp <dig> binding site is sufficient to stimulate promoter activity  <cit> . sp <dig> is commonly known as a transcriptional activator and has been shown to be able to up-regulate transcription in a variety of promoters including topoisomerase iiα  <cit> . sp1-mediated transcriptional activation depends on  <dig> zinc finger structures responsible for dna binding, and at least one of two q-rich regions  that are required for protein/protein interactions and coincident synergistic transactivation  <cit> .

sp <dig> is similar to sp <dig> in a number of ways: it is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, has increased dna binding affinity when phosphorylated, and has the ability to compete with the same target sequences with similar binding affinities due to similar dna binding domains. the major difference between the two transcription factors is that sp <dig> is bifunctional, possessing the ability to act not only as a repressor, but also as an activator. the repressive function of sp <dig> has been attributed to a region near the n-terminus, which acts as a transcriptional repressor of several activators. it is thought that promoters with a single binding site can be activated by sp <dig>  but those with multiple binding sites respond weakly to sp <dig> or not at all  <cit> . while sp <dig> may be able to form homo-oligomers synergistic transactivation does not occur  <cit> .

important chromosomal activities and the properties of local chromatin structure affect gene expression, origin firing, and dna replication  <cit> . first described by dekker et al.,  <dig>  <cit> , chromosome conformation capture allows the analysis of spatial organization of chromosomes. this method affords high resolution and specific definition of chromatin conformation. dna looping has been suggested in earlier reports  <cit>  to have important implications in the functional properties of protein-promoter interactions particularly in the case of sp1/sp <dig> interactions with the gc <dig> and gc <dig> regions in the human topoisomerase iiα promoter.

in this study we explore the regulation of the human topoisomerase iiα promoter in vivo using mda mb  <dig> cells in the early stages of treatment with doxorubicin, a cytotoxic drug commonly used to treat breast cancer. we show that sp <dig> has a dominant repressive effect on sp1-mediated activation. with lower levels of topoisomerase iiα evident in drug treated breast cancer cells, these data suggest that sp <dig> may play a vital role in the development of resistance to chemotherapy and supports earlier work that suggested sp <dig> was upregulated in etoposide/teniposide-resistant kb cell lines  <cit> . we also show that gc <dig> and gc <dig> are indeed on a dna loop indicating that both gc regions play an important part in the regulation of the promoter.

RESULTS
transcription factors sp <dig> and sp <dig> bind to both gc <dig> and gc2
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis using mda mb  <dig> cells shows that both the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements of the topoisomerase iiα promoter are occupied by both sp <dig> and sp <dig> in vivo . fold enrichment values are presented as "relative occupancy units" and were calculated by subtracting background immunoprecipitation efficiencies from observed immunoprecipitation efficiencies. input was arbitrarily set at  <dig> after background correction. for gc <dig> binding, the sp <dig> control  was found to have  <dig> occupancy units over the input, while the  <dig> and  <dig> hour treatments were shown to have  <dig> and  <dig> occupancy units respectively. association of sp <dig> with gc <dig> at the control  and  <dig> hour treatments is comparable to that of sp <dig> association, with  <dig> and  <dig> occupancy units respectively. sp <dig> data at the  <dig> hour time point, on the other hand, show higher relative protein occupancy. sp <dig> occupancy units at gc <dig> for control ,  <dig> hour, and  <dig> hour treatments were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. sp <dig> protein occupancy at gc <dig> showed a reverse trend for the same treatment times with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> units.

these data suggest that more sp <dig> and sp <dig> protein can bind to gc <dig> in vivo than to gc <dig>  when exposed to doxorubicin, there is no significant change in occupancy at gc <dig> for either sp <dig> or sp <dig> at  <dig> hour and  <dig> hours after exposure . there is however, a significant difference between sp <dig> and sp <dig> occupancy  <dig> hours after exposure, with the association between sp <dig> and gc <dig> being  <dig>  fold greater than sp <dig> association with gc <dig>  the occupancy by sp <dig> and sp <dig> of gc <dig>  however, is decreased by 20% and  <dig> % respectively after  <dig> hours of drug exposure and by  <dig> % and 100% respectively after  <dig> hours of drug exposure . while we cannot rule out the presence of a larger template containing both the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements, these differences in occupancy suggest that separated dna elements were in fact immunoprecipitated and support the conclusion that both sp <dig> and sp <dig> bind to each of gc <dig> and gc <dig> in vivo.

sp <dig> and sp <dig> act as transcriptional activator and repressor respectively
mda mb  <dig> cells were transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter vector pgl3basic incorporating the - <dig> promoter of human topoisomerase iiα  <cit> . this region contains both the distal gc <dig> element and the proximal gc <dig> element. in each assay, the pcmv sport β-galactosidase vector was used as a control for transfection efficiency. the effects of sp <dig> and sp <dig> on transcription were tested by co-transfecting increasing amounts of sp <dig> and sp <dig> expression vectors respectively . sp <dig> has been shown previously to be a transcriptional activator in both hela  <cit>  and mda mb  <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig> clearly shows sp <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor of human topoisomerase iiα by decreasing expression in a dose-dependent manner by approximately 60% at the highest concentration used.

since sp <dig> and sp <dig> can bind to both gc elements in vivo as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> we sought to determine whether one had a dominant functional effect over the other. transient transfections using a range of concentrations of sp <dig> and sp <dig> were carried out. these experiments show that the repressive effect of sp <dig> can only partially be overcome by sp <dig>  where with equal quantities of added sp <dig> and sp <dig>  transcriptional activity is approaching control values. in addition, the activating effect of sp <dig> is completely abolished by sp <dig> where with even a 4: <dig> ratio of sp1:sp <dig> the transcriptional activity is the same as the control . these results suggest that sp <dig> and sp <dig> are activators and repressors respectively of human topoisomerase iiα in vivo. more importantly they suggest that sp <dig> is functionally dominant over sp <dig> 

expression of endogenous topoisomerase ii alpha, sp <dig> and sp <dig> in doxorubicin exposed breast cancer cells
semi-quantitative immunoblotting of cell extracts was carried out and the amounts of topoisomerase iiα, sp <dig>  and sp <dig> were expressed as a percentage relative to tubulin and normalised to the control  which was arbitrarily set at 100%. the results showed decreased amounts of topoisomerase iiα and sp <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after exposure when compared to unexposed  control cells. amount of sp <dig> increased in relation to the control . these results clearly show a significant difference between the control and drug-exposed cells for all proteins at each time point and suggest that the changes in expression of sp <dig>  sp <dig>  and topoisomerase iiα are the result of exposure to doxorubicin. the molecular mechanism responsible for the altered expression of both sp <dig> and sp <dig>  however, is uncertain.

gc <dig> and gc <dig> exist in close proximity on looped dna in hela cells
chromosome conformation capture results  show that gc <dig> and gc <dig> are located within close spatial proximity on the human topoisomerase iiα promoter in vivo as suggested previously  <cit> . the results show an uncut pcr product representing ligated promoter in lane  <dig>  with a size of  <dig> bp. this is in comparison to the uncut pcr product produced from untreated genomic dna in lane  <dig> . digestion of the ligation product  yields two fragments , while digestion of the genomic dna product  yields three fragments  as predicted from the genomic dna sequence. these results suggest that the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements are normally  positioned in vivo close to the transcription start point by virtue of the interactions between sp <dig> and/or other factors with the cognate dna.

discussion
while it has been documented that sp <dig> binds to gc rich regions in the topoisomerase iiα promoter  <cit>  there has been no study reported to date that addresses specificity protein/gc interactions at the topoisomerase iiα promoter in vivo. here we show, for the first time, that both sp <dig> and sp <dig> bind to both the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements of the topoisomerase iiα promoter in vivo and there is a greater occupancy of both proteins at gc <dig> than at gc <dig>  these observations implicate gc <dig> as having a major role in basal transcription of topoisomerase iiα while gc <dig> may function in a more modulatory capacity. we have previously shown that sp <dig> acting at the gc <dig> element may repress basal transcription via a putative interaction at the icb <dig> and gc <dig> elements either by direct interaction or the recruitment of other regulatory proteins  <cit> . these findings suggested that proteins bound to the gc <dig> element may act as repressors, which is supported by the current data from chip analysis indicating that both sp <dig> and sp <dig> can interact in vivo with gc <dig> . putative interactions with other transcriptional modulators however, cannot be ruled out. chromosome conformation capture assays used in this study support the findings suggested by mastrangelo et al.,  <dig>  <cit> , that there is a physical loop formed which results in a strongly increased concentration of transcriptional modulators at the proximal promoter. it has been reported that transcription activities are related to the overall spatial arrangements between protein transcription factors and their cognate dna elements  <cit> . we show that sp <dig> and sp <dig> bind to both gc <dig> and gc <dig> in vivo and are likely to modulate transcription due to both dna/protein  interactions and protein/protein interactions between sp <dig> facilitated by dna looping between the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements of the topoisomerase iiα promoter. as sp <dig> does not form multimers or interact with sp <dig>  <cit> , the repressive effect of sp <dig> is likely to be due to its dominant effect over sp <dig>  our data suggest that sp <dig> can displace sp <dig> from either or both gc <dig> and gc <dig> and this would be likely to open the chromatin loop.

we have previously shown that sp <dig> can up-regulate transcription of topoisomerase iiα  <cit>  and this current study supports sp <dig> as a transcriptional activator of topoisomerase iiα. these findings are consistent with other work, which has shown that in the rat topoisomerase iiα promoter, sp <dig> is a transcriptional activator at the gc <dig> element, which is spatially equivalent to the gc <dig> element of the human topoisomerase iiα promoter  <cit> .

more importantly we show for the first time that sp <dig> is a transcriptional repressor of topoisomerase iiα that is functionally dominant over sp <dig>  immunoblotting results indicate that changes in expression levels of these proteins occur with exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. other reports suggest that in some promoter contexts both sp <dig> and sp <dig> have both activator  <cit>  and repressor functions  <cit> . moreover, the repressive functions of sp <dig> transcription factors have recently been implicated in breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . reduced sp <dig> rna levels in merbarone-resistant human leukemic cem cells have been shown to correlate with a down-regulation of topoisomerase iiα protein levels  <cit> . these authors also showed that co-transfection of sp <dig> induced topoisomerase iiα promoter activity in drug sensitive cem cells in a dose dependent manner. conversely, sp <dig> levels were shown to be elevated in etoposide/teniposide-resistant kb cells, and this elevation correlated with a decrease in topoisomerase iiα activity  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that sp <dig> is normally a transcriptional repressor of topoisomerase iiα, but its effects are likely to be cell type specific.

in co-transfection studies using sp <dig> and/or sp <dig> expression plasmids other reports have shown that while sp <dig> stimulated, sp <dig> repressed sp1-mediated transactivation of human transcobalanin ii  transcription  <cit> . in functional analyses using drosophila sl- <dig> cells, sp <dig> expression can drive transcription from the elastin proximal promoter, while co-expression of sp <dig> results in a repression of sp <dig> activity  <cit> . functional assays have suggested that tgf-beta <dig> inhibition of col2a <dig> gene transcription in rabbit articular chondrocytes is mediated by an increase of the sp3/sp <dig> ratio and by the repression of sp <dig> transactivating effects on that gene  <cit> . these authors found that both proteins bind to the same sites of the c-myc promoter. co-transfection experiments, in mammalian and insect cells, indicated that sp <dig> trans-activated the c-myc promoter, whereas sp <dig> did not. in addition, enforced expression of sp <dig> repressed sp1-mediated activation of c-myc  <cit> . these data support our findings for the transcriptional regulation of human topoisomerase iiα and suggest that sp <dig> may be a common modulator of sp1-dependent transcriptional activation.

the dominant repressive activity of sp <dig> over sp <dig> has important implications for the expression of topoisomerase iiα in doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. our results show that in unexposed and drug exposed cells, sp <dig> and sp <dig> both interact with the topoisomerase iiα promoter at the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements in vivo. we have previously shown an interaction between both sp <dig> and sp <dig> with an isolated gc <dig> element in vitro but sp <dig> was only able to bind to a composite element containing both icb <dig> and gc <dig>  <cit> . this suggests more complex interactions may occur between dna and protein in vivo and conformation of the chromatin in the topoisomerase iiα promoter may have a critical role in allowing access and binding of transcription factors. in addition, while both sp <dig> and sp <dig> are able to interact with gc <dig> in untreated cells, occupancy at this site is significantly less than at gc <dig>  we, and others have shown that topoisomerase iiα expression levels are reduced in drug resistant breast cancer cells. co-transfection assays have shown that sp <dig> negatively impacts sp1-mediated activation. sp1/sp <dig> co-transfection results, coupled with the results of sp <dig> chip assays therefore suggest that sp <dig> plays a critical role in the down-regulation of topoisomerase iiα in drug treated breast cancer cells. we have previously shown that the absolute amounts of sp <dig> in some doxorubicin-resistant cell lines with reduced topoisomerase iiα did not alter significantly, while sp <dig> levels were significantly reduced  <cit> . taken together these data support the suggestion that the ratio of sp1/sp <dig> is likely to be a critical factor in determining the level of expression of topoisomerase iiα and hence sensitivity to doxorubicin treatment.

we have previously suggested that dna looping at the topoisomerase iiα promoter may be involved in determining expression levels of the gene  <cit> . the results presented here demonstrate that a dna loop can be formed at the topoisomerase iiα promoter between the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements. when sp <dig> levels are sufficiently high, it is likely that occupancy at both gc <dig> and gc <dig> occurs to form a multi-protein/dna complex and maximal transcription. drug treatment reduces sp <dig> levels and subsequently causes a reduction in binding at both gc <dig> and gc <dig>  at the same time sp <dig> levels rise and while occupancy at gc <dig> does not change markedly, there is a significant increase of occupancy at gc <dig> by sp <dig>  sp <dig>  in preference to sp <dig>  bound at both gc <dig> and gc <dig> would cause opening of the chromatin loop  and a concomitant decrease in topoisomerase iiα expression. this correlates with the up-regulation of expression we observed previously in transient transfection assays using the - <dig> topoisomerase iiα promoter carrying a point mutation in the gc <dig> element, that would preclude binding of sp <dig>  <cit> . where ratios of sp1/sp <dig> are high a multiprotein/dna complex is likely to form, with accompanying high levels of expression . as the ratio of sp1/sp <dig> drops with drug treatment sp <dig> will start to replace sp <dig> at both gc <dig> and gc <dig> with less likelihood of forming a chromatin loop . absolute levels of transcription will then depend upon the ratio of sp1/sp <dig> in the cell but as sp <dig> is dominant over sp <dig>  relatively small increases in sp <dig> levels or decreases in sp1/sp <dig> ratio could result in reduced transcription of topoisomerase iiα. as these effects occur early in drug treatment, the expression levels of sp <dig> and sp <dig> may be the primary determinants of topoisomerase iiα expression in the early stages of chemotherapy. initial low protein levels of topoisomerase iiα as shown in figure  <dig>  would be predicted to result in fewer cleavable complexes allowing effective dna repair to take place, consequently leading to drug resistance in the longer term.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that reduced transcription of topoisomerase iiα associated with doxorubicin treatment is likely to be due to the reduction in sp <dig> that has been shown to occur at cell cycle arrest  <cit>  allowing sp <dig> to exert its dominant repressive effect. this has important implications for chemotherapy using drugs that target both topoisomerase iiα and cause cell cycle arrest. if the sp1/sp <dig> ratio could be manipulated such that topoisomerase iiα transcription remains at high levels, the drugs classed as topoisomerase ii poisons may be more effective. alternatively, assessment of sp1/sp <dig> ratios in cancer cells may provide an additional prognostic marker for treatment with drugs like doxorubicin that cause cell cycle arrest.
