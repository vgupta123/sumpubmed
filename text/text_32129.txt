BACKGROUND
the pectinolytic enterobacteria of the pectobacterium and dickeya genera are causative agents of maceration-associated diseases affecting a wide variety of crops and ornamentals  <cit> . during the past century, the species pectobacterium atrosepticum and pectobacterium carotovorum dominated the pathogenic populations in samples collected from black-leg and soft-rot symptoms of potato plants and tubers under temperate climates. since the 1970’s, dickeya strains, mostly d. dianthicola, were also detected in potato fields in europe. more recently, in the 2000’s, a novel species called dickeya solani <cit> , emerged among the pectinolytic enterobacteria recovered from potato symptoms in several countries. the emergence and challenges of the dickeya species in potato production have been deeply discussed by toth et al. <cit> .

genetic markers and biochemical tests allowed to clearly distinguishing these novel pathogenic strains from the established dickeya species, including d. dianthicola, d. dadantii, d. zeae, d. chrysanthemi, d. paradisiaca and d. dieffenbachia <cit> . aside the current effort on the taxonomic description of d. solani, questions arose about the origin, adaptation, ecology and, in an applied issue, the control of this emerging plant pathogen on potato cultures. even if only a few genetic markers were analysed in several d. solani isolates from different countries, their high similarities suggested a clonal origin of d. solani populations affecting the potato plant host  <cit> . remarkably, under greenhouse conditions at a high temperature , when the two bacterial species d. solani and d. dianthicola are coinoculated, d. solani isolates outcompete those of the other dickeya species, revealing a high efficiency for colonizing potato roots and stems  <cit> . the genes and functions involved in these traits are still unknown.

for several decades, d. dadantii strain  <dig> was widely used as a model system for research on the molecular biology and pathogenicity of pectinolytic enterobacteria. the d. dadantii  <dig> strain remains, until today, the dickeya isolate in which virulence factors and host-interacting functions are the most studied  <cit> . its annotated genome is available  <cit> , hence is used for fruitful comparison with the released draft and completed genomes belonging to dickeya and other plant pathogenic genera.

the d. solani strain  <dig>  has been isolated from potato in france in  <dig>  <cit>  and its aggressiveness on potato plants has been confirmed  <cit> . in this paper, we reported a genomic and metabolic comparison of the d. solani strain  <dig> and d. dadantii strain  <dig> 

methods
bacterial strains, culture conditions and metabolic assays
d. solani  <dig>   <cit>  and d. dadantii  <dig>  <cit>  were routinely cultured in ty medium  at 30°c. the metabolic abilities of d. solani  <dig> and d. dadantii  <dig> were investigated using the carbon source microplates pm <dig> and pm2a and the nitrogen source microplate pm3b . sodium pyruvate was used as a carbon source for testing the nitrogen sources. the experiment was duplicated. according manufacturer’s instructions, od590nm  was read at the inoculation time  and after a 48 h incubation ; variation Δod = tf-ti was calculated for each of the tested nitrogen and carbon sources. a Δodvalue <  <dig>  indicated that bacteria did not metabolize the nutrients;  <dig>  ≤ Δod <  <dig> revealed a weak metabolic activity and Δod ≥  <dig> referred to a very efficient metabolic activity.

genome sequencing of d. solani 3337
two dna-libraries were constructed by eurofins genomics  using the truseq sbs v <dig> sequencing kit: a shotgun  paired-end library with a fragment size between  <dig> to 500 bp and a long jumping distance  mate-pair library with an insert-size average of  <dig>  kbp. the two libraries were sequenced using 2× <dig> bp paired-end read module of illuminahiseq  <dig> by eurofins genomics . reads were trimmed on quality and length. sequence assembly was carried out using the clc genomics workbench v <dig>  with a read length of  <dig>  and a similarity of  <dig> . forty-two contigs were obtained with a length ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> kbp. the scaffolding was processed using sspace basic v <dig>   <cit> .

in silico finishing
the in silico finishing of some gaps was carried out by mapping  the mate-pair reads on each of the  <dig> kbp contig-ends since the de novo assembly software faced difficulty during assembly in repeated regions. we used the borders of the gap regions as anchor and retrieved the reads in both orientations in order to perform a new de novo assembly on these regions. the mapped reads were collected and both orientation r <dig> and r <dig> were retrieved. the reads were used for de novo local assembling . additional gaps were closed by sanger sequencing of pcr amplicons.

annotation of the d. solani  <dig> genome and comparison with d. dadantii 3937
the functional annotation of predicted genes of d. solani  <dig> was achieved using the rast server  <cit>  with the glimmer  <dig> gene caller  <cit> . as the genome annotation of d. dadantii  <dig> was performed in  <dig> with the version  <dig> of glimmer, this genome was also re-annotated with the same rast server in order to compare genes predicted with the same algorithm. in d. solani  <dig>  the remaining gaps affect  <dig> genes that were not considered in the subsequent analysis.

synteny analysis was performed by using the mauve software  <cit> . average nucleotide identity  was computed using the jspecies package  <cit> . genome to genome comparison was performed by bi-directional protein-protein blast sequence comparison of translated open reading frames  with a 10- <dig> e-value threshold. genes of both species were considered as strain-specific if identity of the encoded protein was lower than 80% of full-length amino acids sequence. for comparison, average identity level of the proteins encoded by conserved genes, calculated as the mean of all identity percentages, is 96%. if local alignments were too short as regard to the length of similar sequences, we performed a nucleotide blast on full-length dna sequences with similar thresholds . this allowed us to eliminate false strain-specific genes. in some cases, identities were lower than 80% due to differences in predicted orf length. such differences in length of similar sequences was the consequence of wrong prediction of start codons or when two predicted orfs in one species matched with one orf in the other one. all similar but strain-specific sequences that differ by more than 10% in length were manually analysed to detect putative wrong start codon prediction or occurrence of stop codons that could explain the interruption of one orf.

comparison of the d. solani  <dig> genome with other dickeya draft genomes
the d. dadantii  <dig> genome resulted from sanger genomics. the production of reads mimicking illumina reads of the d. dadantii  <dig> genome was performed using metasim  <cit> . a set of  <dig> , <dig> reads derived from the d. dadantii  <dig> genome with an average size of  <dig> nucleotides were produced and used for mapping approaches as described below.

the illumina reads of d. solani  <dig> and simulated reads from d. dadantii  <dig> were mapped using the draft genomes of the four d. solani strains ipo <dig>  mk <dig>  mk <dig> and lmg <dig>  <cit>  and the d. dadantii genome and draft genomes of the strains d. dadantii  <dig>  ncppb <dig> and ncppb <dig>  two mappings were performed at high  and mild stringency threshold . using such in silico dna-dna hybridizations, a high proportion of mapped reads will indicate a strong identity between genome sequences. then, the mapping files constructed using high stringency parameters were processed for snp analysis.

in addition, the presence of genomic clusters in the d. solani and d. dadantii species was searched with a nucleotide blast analysis using the sequences of the specific clusters as queries against a database constituted by the d. solani and d. dadantii genomes .

the search for the presence of d. solani-specific and d. dadantii  <dig> specific-genes in other dickeya species was performed by bi-directional protein-protein blast sequence comparison  with the d. paradisiaca  <dig> strain , the d. zeae  <dig> strain  and the d. chrysanthemi  <dig> strain  as reclassified by pritchard et al. <cit> .

genome accession numbers
the d. solani  <dig> genome sequence has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession n°amyi <dig>  sequence data used in this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under the following accession numbers: d. solani strains ipo <dig> , mk <dig> , mk <dig> , lmg <dig> , and d. dadantii strains  <dig> , ncppb <dig> , ncppb <dig> .

RESULTS
general features of the d. solani  <dig> genome
the published sequence of d. solani  <dig> is composed of eleven contigs  grouped in a single scaffold with  <dig>  coverage in average. the in silico approach permits to close  <dig> gaps and to map the  <dig> rrs regions. hence, the d. solani  <dig> genome consists of a unique  <dig>  mb circular chromosome with a  <dig> % gc content and contains no plasmid. these features are in accordance with data of the dickeya genome and draft genomes that are available in public databases  <cit> . using the rast server with the glimmer  <dig> caller, gene prediction and automatic annotation predicted  <dig> protein-coding sequences,  <dig> trna genes and  <dig> rrna regions.

comparative genomics between d. solani  <dig> and d. dadantii 3937: an overview
to go further into the d. solani  <dig> genome analysis, we took advantage of the manually annotated genome of the model d. dadantii  <dig> strain  <cit> . to allow a precise comparison, a novel gene prediction with glimmer  <dig> was achieved on the d. dadantii  <dig> genome leading to the prediction of  <dig> protein-coding sequences and  <dig> rna genes. noticeably,  <dig> new genes were identified with the glimmer  <dig> software as compared to the previous gene prediction but only  <dig> have a known or predicted function. all the other cds are annotated as hypothetical and 85%  are smaller than  <dig> amino acids.

the relatedness between these genomes was first analysed using the mauve program . this reveals a very high synteny between both genomes that was only interrupted by a big inversion between two rrs ribosomal rna-encoding operons present in opposite orientation, and by the insertion at different positions in both genomes of a region of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb respectively. these regions contain both common and strain-specific genes .

genes conserved in both strains were identified by performing bidirectional best hit analysis at the protein level and retaining only the genes that encode proteins exhibiting at least 80% identity on full length amino acid sequence. manual check of remaining genes allowed the identification of additional conserved genes excluded from the previous test because of prediction or alignment ambiguities . about  <dig> genes have homologues in both strains. this corresponds to 78-82% of the total protein-coding sequences. this is in fact comparable to the core genome size of certain bacterial species such as porphyromonas gingivalis or streptococcus pneumoniae <cit>  and is considerably larger than that of other enterobacterial species such as e. coli <cit> . the closeness of both strains is supported by the 94% average nucleotide identity  value, an analysis that has emerged as one of the predominant genomics alternatives to dna-dna hybridization and stated that two strains belong to the same species if their pairwise ani values are higher than 96%  <cit> . it is also in accordance with previous taxonomic studies that place d. solani and d. dadantii species close to each other  <cit> .

most virulence genes are conserved between d. solani  <dig> and d. dadantii 3937
the main virulence factors
the main virulence determinants in soft rot enterobacteria are plant cell wall degrading enzymes  that cause extensive tissue maceration during the latter stages of infection  <cit> . the d. dadantii genome contains  <dig> pectinases encoding genes including pectate and pectin lyases, polygalacturonases, pectin-methyl and acetyl esterases. all corresponding genes are present in d. solani except the pectin lyase encoding pnlh gene  and the pehk gene  encoding a predicted polygalacturonase that is present in all  <dig> dickeya for which complete genomes are available, several pectobacterium strains and several other enterobacteria. both strains shared the same battery of cellulases and extracellular proteases as well as iron uptake systems, production of antioxydants like indigoidine and systems involved in defence against the plant oxidative burst or antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . concerning protection to osmotic stress however, the ousa gene encoding the major osmoprotectant uptake system in d. dadantii  <dig> is missing in d. solani. interestingly, an ousa disruption in d. dadantii  <dig> highly enhanced bacterial virulence on potato tubers and enhanced pel production in vitro under micro-aerobiosis conditions. this might be correlated to the observation that the less nacl-tolerant dickeya strains are the more virulent in potato tubers  <cit> .

proteins secretion systems of type  <dig> to  <dig> and toxin/antitoxin systems
like d. dadantii <cit> , d. solani possesses all six known gram-negative protein secretion systems and the corresponding genes are highly conserved in both strains. the stt second type  <dig> secretion system  present in the d. dadantii  <dig> strain is however missing in d. solani  <dig> as well as the pnlh pectin lyase that is presented to the outer side of the outer membrane by this stt system  <cit> . while proteins shown or predicted to be secreted by secretion systems  <dig> to  <dig> are conserved in both strains, the repertoire of proteins transiting to t5ss and t6ss is more variable. interestingly, these two systems have been shown to be involved in toxin delivery. t5ss encompass two-partner secretion systems called tps that consist of an outer membrane tspb protein allowing the secretion of a large tspa multidomain protein composed of an n-terminal transport domain, a large hemagglutinin-like region that is proposed to form a fiber-like structure and, in some cases, a c-terminal toxin domain. d. dadantii  <dig> possesses two tps systems that have been shown to act in contact-dependent growth inhibition  by delivering the c-terminal toxin domain of tspa/cdia  to target cells. the two d. dadantii  <dig> cdia-ct toxins differ, the first one being a trnase and the second one harboring dnase activity. each cdi system also encodes a specific cdii immunity protein that interacts with the cognate cdia-ct toxin to prevent auto-inhibition  <cit> . in d. solani  <dig>  two cdi systems are also present at similar locations than in d. dadantii  <dig>  they share a high similarity with the corresponding d. dadantii  <dig> proteins except for the  <dig> c-terminal bp of cdia corresponding to the toxin ct part . d. dadantii  <dig> also possesses  <dig> copies of the toxin/antitoxin rhs  system and two of them  were shown to mediate intercellular competition and harbor dnase activity  <cit> . the rhs proteins are large composite proteins consisting of a large n-domain containing yd-peptide repeats and a highly variable c-domain harboring toxic activity. the rhs encoding genes are followed by a small rhsi gene encoding an immunity protein that blocks the toxic activity of the corresponding rhs-ct. d. dadantii  <dig> possesses  <dig> rhs genes linked to hemolysin-coregulated protein  and valine-glycine repeat protein g  that encode the components of the external part of t6ss  <cit> . vgrg is required for d. dadantii  <dig> rhs inhibitor cell function pointing to the export of rhs protein via a type  <dig> secretion system  <cit> . d. solani also carries  <dig> rhs proteins located in the similar genomic regions as in d. dadantii  <dig>  the relatedness between d. dadantii and d. solani rhs systems is variable: the rhsa system is totally conserved between both strains  while rhsb proteins only show moderate similarity between both strains both in their n-domain and rhs-ct domains. the rhsc locus encodes similar large n-domains but differs in the toxin/antitoxin moiety and also in the number and sequence of additional orphan rhs-ct/rhsi pairs . the two t5ss-related cdi systems are present in the other sequenced dickeya species but only the d. chrysanthemi  <dig> cdi n-end part is conserved with d. solani  <dig>  all other toxin cterm are divergent. the  <dig> rhs loci are present in d. chrysanthemi  <dig> and d. zeae  <dig>  only rhscdze <dig> is totally homologous to rhscdso <dig>  all other rhs proteins harbor divergent cterm toxin motives. interestingly, it should be noted that a t6ss system is missing in d. paradisiaca  <dig> strain .

production of plant hormones
among genes that may be involved in plant-bacteria interactions, it should be noted that the d. dadantii iaamh genes  allowing the production of an auxin plant hormone, do not have counterparts in d. solani. accordingly, d. solani produces only minute amounts of indolic compounds related to auxins as compared to d. dadantii <cit> .

virulence regulatory pathways
in d. dadantii, a complex regulatory network composed of several global regulators  <cit>  out of whom the gacas two-component systems, the pecs and mfbr members of the marr family of regulators, or the recently discovered new quorum-sensing system vfm, have been shown to control virulence gene expression in planta <cit> . all these regulators are present in d. solani. out of the  <dig> members of the marr family present in d. dadantii  <dig> however,  <dig> corresponding genes  are missing in d. solani  <dig>  these regulators were shown to be dispensable for full virulence expression in d. dadantii but they might have a role in other parts of the bacterial life cycle since in different bacteria, regulators of this family are involved in the sensing of signalling molecules  <cit> . by contrast, all d. dadantii regulators of the laci family are present in d. solani. this family of regulators are very often related to global metabolism and some of them are involved in virulence in d. dadantii  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, d. solani possesses functional arcb and soxs genes, two genes involved respectively in the aerobiosis/anaerobiosis switch and in oxidative defence regulation that are either mutated  or absent  in d. dadantii  <dig>  <cit> .

strain-specific genes in d. solani  <dig> and d. dadantii 3937: an overview
a systematic analysis allowed the identification of  <dig> genes of d. solani  <dig> and  <dig> genes of d. dadantii  <dig> that are present in one strain but not the other or that exhibit less than 80% identity . among them,  <dig> d. solani  <dig> and  <dig> d. dadantii  <dig> genes encode hypothetical proteins having no related proteins in databases. it should be noted that 2/ <dig> of them encode peptides of less than  <dig> amino acids for which transcription and translation is questionable. it should also be noted that only some thirty genes in each genome present sequence changes leading to the production of a truncated or out of phase protein , indicating that only a few strain-specific genes result from mutations in the corresponding gene in the other genome.

1numbers in brackets correspond to the number of proteins smaller than  <dig> amino acids.

2numbers in brackets correspond to the number of strain-specific proteins that are also absent in other dickeya species .

for  <dig> and  <dig> of these strain-specific genes respectively, a function is known or predicted, and for each strain about  <dig> genes are absent from other sequenced dickeya species . all these strain-specific genes were manually classified in functional categories and the relative distribution of these categories was determined for both strains . though the number of specific genes involved in transport or regulation was roughly the same in both strains, the d. dadantii  <dig> genome is clearly enriched in mobile elements and phage-associated genes while d. solani  <dig> harbors more specific genes involved in metabolism. in both strains, more than 2/ <dig> of strain-specific genes having a predicted function are clustered in genomic regions  that are positioned along the chromosome .

the d. solani  <dig> genome is poor in mobile elements and phage-related genes and defective for crispr
insertion sequences  and transposable elements may promote genome plasticity and contribute to bacterial adaptability  <cit> . while about 40% of the d. dadantii  <dig> strain-specific genes of known or predicted function  are related to mobile elements or phages functions, only  <dig> such genes were identified in d. solani. this is due in part to the presence of a tn <dig> ice  family element in gr <dig>   <cit>  and a complete prophage with morphogenesis genes related to haemophilus hp <dig> and hp <dig> genes in d. dadantii  <dig> . unlike d. solani  <dig>  d. dadantii  <dig> also harbors a region with crispr  sequences and associated genes . crispr are thought to provide acquired resistance to viruses in prokaryotes, as recently demonstrated in streptococcus thermophilus <cit> . beside this, d. dadantii  <dig> possesses two times more genes related to transposases  than d. solani  <dig>  accordingly, detection of is elements using the isbiotoul server  reveals the presence of only  <dig> full length is  in d. solani while  <dig> full length is are present in d. dadantii  <dig>  remarkably, the d. solani is110-related sequence is inserted into a transposase gene in the gr <dig> region that contains in total  <dig> of the  <dig> d. solani transposase-related genes and a t6ss-related hcp encoding gene . the other is is surrounded by genes related to phage components in the gr <dig> region.

most d. dadantii 3937-specific genomic regions  contained transposase or integrase encoding genes that are indications of acquisition by horizontal transfer . in contrast only  <dig> d. solani 3337-specific regions contain such genes . the most representative example of such an acquisition by horizontal transfer is the large genomic islands located at different positions in both genomes . interestingly, these islands contain a mixture of conserved and unique genes and present signs of multiple chromosomal rearrangements . both islands contain the genes encoding the type  <dig> secretion system, that are flanked by genes related to plasmid mobilization systems, and a region comprising several small genes related to regulators, some of them being related to phage functions. both islands are also flanked by a conserved integrase and harbor two genes encoding the t6ss-related hcp and vgrg proteins as well as the related rhsb gene.

dickeya
distinctive metabolic properties between d. solani  <dig> and d. dadantii 3937
besides  <dig> genomic regions consisting of mobile elements and/or phage related genes ,  <dig> d. solani-specific genomic regions comprise genes encoding known or putative metabolic pathways . analysis with the antismash server  <cit>  identified three of these gr as gene clusters that encode complex non ribosomal peptide synthases  and polyketide synthases  as well as associated proteins . these very large multidomain and multimodular proteins are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of polymers of peptidyl/carbonyl chains that harbor numerous biological activities varying from adaptation to unfavourable environments, competition to other microorganisms or action as virulence factors  <cit> .

each module allows the addition of one unit of the synthesized polymer. the core module of pks consists of an acyl carrier protein  domain for unit loading and a beta-ketosynthase  domain for condensation. for pks activity, an acyltransferase  domain is also required. this at activity may be provided either by an at domain incorporated in each module or by discrete free-standing acyltransferase enzymes in the case of trans-at pkss. the core module of nrps consists of an adenylation  domain for the selection of one amino acid, a peptidyl carrier protein  and a condensation domain  for catalysing peptide bond formation  <cit> . among the d. solani genomic regions, gr <dig> regroups  <dig> genes related to metabolism among which  <dig> genes encoding nrps that regroup  <dig> synthetic modules, one trans-acetyltransferase and a trans-at pks of  <dig> modules. this gene cluster appears to be specific to some dickeya since it is found only in d. zeae  <dig> in databases. gr <dig> regroups  <dig> metabolic genes among which  <dig> genes encoding trans-at pks modules and two trans-at encoding genes. this gene cluster is present in d. paradisiaca  <dig> and in serratia odorifera. gr <dig> is also a complex gene cluster regrouping a mix of  <dig> genes encoding nrps modules and  <dig> pks related genes. beside  <dig> genes related to production of secondary metabolites, this cluster also encodes one regulatory protein and  <dig> proteins involved in transport systems. this gene cluster has counterparts in serratia and partly in xenorhabdus bovienii.

the other d. solani-specific metabolic regions typically regroup one or more regulators and a few enzymes sometimes accompanied by a transport system. this prompted us to compare the metabolic capacities of d. dadantii  <dig> and d. solani  <dig> with biolog plates. the use of  <dig> compounds as carbon and  <dig> compounds as nitrogen sources was compared. among these,  <dig> compounds as carbon sources and  <dig> compounds as nitrogen sources were differentially metabolized by d. dadantii  <dig> and d. solani  <dig> with a clear enrichment of nitrogen sources that can be metabolized by d. solani . interestingly, these differences could be correlated to the presence or absence of metabolic and transport genes. in particular, d. solani harbors genes involved in urea metabolism and transport  that are absent in d. dadantii 3937; the assimilation of urea as a nitrogen source by d. solani  <dig> was validated in a growth assay . in addition, d. solani harbours genes encoding for galactonate assimilation ; the growth of d. solani  <dig> on galactonate and its γ-lactone derivative as a carbon source was validated in a growth assay . in contrast, d. dadantii  <dig> possesses a second citrate metabolic cluster  that is correlated to an enhanced metabolic ability to use this compound . two of these metabolic genomic regions are also present in d. zeae  <dig>  while gr <dig> is present in d. paradisiaca  <dig> and gr  <dig> is present in d. chrysanthemi  <dig> as well as in salmonella strains .

a, ‘-‘ indicates the absence of metabolism; ‘+’ a weak metabolic capability, and ‘++’ a high metabolic capability .

the  <dig> grs of d. solani  <dig> are also present in all available draft genomes of d. solani
blast analysis revealed that all the  <dig> grs of d. solani  <dig> are present in the genomes of the d. solani strains ipo <dig>  mk <dig>  mk <dig> and lmg <dig>  similarly, mauve analysis shows a complete synteny between these d. solani genomes except that the big inversion between rrs operons found in d. solani  <dig> strain as compared to d. dadantii  <dig> is not present in other d. solani strains.

additional genomic comparisons were performed using an in silico dna-dna hybridization approach. mapping of the d. solani  <dig> reads on the d. solani and d. dadantii present in databases reveals the high similarities of the genomes of the d. solani species . this result reinforces the preliminary data obtained using single-gene sequence data  <cit> . the same procedure with the generated reads of d. dadantii  <dig> revealed that the d. dadantii strains are more diverse in their genomic content . these in silico genome-hybridization method clearly separated the two species .

the high genome similarity among d. solani isolates is confirmed with snp analysis. only  <dig> to  <dig> snps were detected between the genome of d. solani  <dig> and the other d. solani genomes . in contrast, at least  <dig>  snps were detected between the d. dadantii  <dig> genome and the genome of the other tested d. dadantii strains .

CONCLUSIONS
the genome comparison between the potato isolate d. solani  <dig> and the model d. dadantii  <dig> only highlights small differences in the arsenal of dickeya virulence factors characterized so far. by contrast, the two strains diverge in their battery of t5ss/t6ss-related toxin-antitoxin systems and harbour distinctive metabolic capacities. in particular, d. solani possesses  <dig> gene clusters regrouping nrps/pks genes known to be involved in the biosynthesis of complex secondary metabolites that were shown in other systems to have antibiotic activities or even to be important in virulence against plants  <cit> . importantly, the d. solani-specific gene clusters are conserved in all draft genomes of d. solani that are available until today. these clusters are thus promising for deciphering the molecular mechanisms supporting the recent emergence and lifestyle of the d. solani species.
