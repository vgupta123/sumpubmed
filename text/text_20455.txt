BACKGROUND
how organisms respond appropriately to b. pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, remains a central question within the burkholderia community. over the past decade, knowledge on the pathogenesis of b. pseudomallei has increased considerably. however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie b. pseudomallei virulence and how this organism is able to interact with its host to elicit melioidosis symptoms. melioidosis can present with an array of clinical symptoms. clinically apparent infections range from acute or chronic localized infection involving a single organ, to fulminant septicaemia in multiple organs  and septic shock  <cit> . the disease may become dormant and the infected person may relapse after months, years or decades   <cit> . the factors influencing disease outcome are not known, although it has been suggested that differences in the virulence of different infecting strains, the route of inoculation and inoculum size might contribute to the clinical outcome of disease  <cit> . underlying diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure are major predisposing factors of melioidosis  <cit> . recently, the risk factor was extended to individuals who were uninjured bystanders during the tsunami of december  <dig>  <cit> .

balb/c mice infected with b. pseudomallei die of septicemic disease with overwhelming bacterial loads in organs and blood, accompanied by organ inflammation and necrosis a few days after infection, reflecting a failure of the host innate immune response  <cit> . mrna for proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor  -α, interferon  -γ and interleukin  - <dig>  were detected earlier and in more abundance in the organs of intravenously infected balb/c mice with acute disease compared to the more resistant c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . additionally, santanirand et al.  <cit>  reported that an early control mechanism is dependent upon the rapid production of ifn- γ, because ifn- γ primes macrophages to increase their bactericidal activity towards b. pseudomallei. gan  reported that the development of acute disease is not due to a lack of but rather an excess of inflammation, reflecting a failure of regulatory mechanisms. melioidosis patients also exhibit elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn-γ, tnf-α, chemokine  ligand  <dig>  and chemokine  ligand  <dig>   <cit> .

in recent years, many studies have focused on the general immune response to shed light on the b. pseudomallei-host interaction. however, to date, a full and complete picture of host responses to this pathogen is still not available. the purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive picture of the host transcriptional response during the acute stage of melioidosis. insight into the events at the early infection stage will improve our understanding of the immediate host responses to counteract this pathogen. to address this, we developed systemic acute melioidosis infection of mice and performed transcriptional analysis of the liver and spleen isolated from mice infected over a  <dig> hr time period. our analysis identified several thousand genes whose expression was altered in b. pseudomallei-infected mice. most notably, the majority of the identified genes were involved in immune response, stress response, cell cycle regulation, proteasomal degradation, cellular metabolism and signal transduction pathways. at the early phase of infection, most of the differentially expressed genes are those involved in the immediate immune responses. however, at  <dig> hr post-infection , the majority of the genes were involved in host cellular metabolism and signal transduction pathways and found to be down-regulated. these results suggest that numerous cellular processes were transcriptionally altered throughout the course of the host response to b. pseudomallei.

RESULTS
development and characterization of acute melioidosis in a mouse model
balb/c mice were challenged with three b. pseudomallei local clinical isolates  via the intravenous  route. the ten-day ld <dig> was determined for each isolate as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the 10-day ld <dig> for b. pseudomallei d <dig>  h <dig> and r <dig> are  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu,  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu, respectively. the mice infected with a dosage of > <dig> cfu b. pseudomallei d <dig> were lethargic, had ruffled fur and developed paresis of both hind legs at the late stage of the course of infection ultimately leading to paralysis before succumbing to infection, similar to a previous report  <cit> . based on the lower ld <dig> value, the d <dig> isolate was chosen for the following experiments.

to characterize the acute melioidosis model, we monitored the kinetics of the bacterial loads in various organs and leukocyte differential counts during the course of infection in balb/c mice infected with  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu of b. pseudomallei d <dig>  at  <dig> hpi, the bacterial load in the spleen  was significantly higher than the liver   while the bacterial load in both organs were similar at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, with an average of  <dig> to  <dig> cfu/organ . the data demonstrates that no significant differences exist in bacterial replication and dissemination within these two organs during the first  <dig> hr of infection. during the course of infection, viable b. pseudomallei were also detected in the blood, although at lower numbers . high numbers of b. pseudomallei in various organs, as well as presence in the blood confirms that systemic acute septicemic melioidosis was successfully developed in balb/c mice. no significant differences were observed in liver and spleen weights at all infection time points  and no clinical signs of illness were observed when compared to the naïve mice.

to determine changes in leukocyte counts and composition during infection of balb/c mice, blood samples from  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hr time points were analyzed. the results of the differential blood film after infection with  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu b. pseudomallei d <dig> revealed a rise in the number of neutrophils over the course of infection . in addition, a decline in lymphocyte counts and finally development of lymphopenia was observed in these b. pseudomallei infected mice as reported previously  <cit> . the neutrophil counts increased about 4-fold as compared to the naïve mice and the size and shape of erythrocytes and leukocytes were normal , demonstrating that haematopoiesis of the host was not affected by the bacteria during the course of infection. the rise in number of granulocytes indicates the innate immune mechanism was triggered in response to b. pseudomallei infection.

global transcriptional responses to acute stage melioidosis
to gain deeper insight into the host response to b. pseudomallei infection, we used the mouse whole-genome microarray from illumina to elucidate the global changes of host gene expression in both infected liver and spleen. we noted that b. pseudomallei infection in balb/c mice at the acute phase results in more differentially expressed genes in the liver compared to the spleen. notably, most of the differentially expressed genes in liver at  <dig> hpi were down-regulated .

in order to gain insight from the large amount of microarray data, gene expression results were analyzed in the context of biological processes utilizing genespring gx <dig> . <dig> expression analysis , pathway studio  <dig>  and the web-based software goterm finder and genetrail software. the analysis outputs consistently demonstrated that the majority of these differentially expressed genes were clustered as host immune response, defence response, cell cycle regulation, proteasomal degradation, signal transduction, and nutrient metabolism related genes . as expected, the early host response is enriched for immediate immune responses, including the inflammatory response, acute-phase proteins response, apoptosis and cell death programs. at  <dig> hpi, a majority of the genes are involved in host cellular metabolism and signal transduction pathways and found to be down-regulated. due to the large number of significantly differentiated genes modulated during the infection, only data related to genes that have some functional information are shown and discussed below. the identified genes were categorized according to functional categories and fold change relative to naïve control mice are presented as a heatmap .

the tlr <dig> pathway is responsible for initiation of host defence responses to b. pseudomallei infection
upon contact with the host cell, b. pseudomallei is known to elicit toll-like receptor  signalling through transmembrane pattern recognition receptors   <cit> . in this study, the expression levels of several tlrs  were modulated; tlr <dig> was highly induced throughout the  <dig> hr time point in the liver. in contrast, tlr <dig>  which detects lipopolysaccharides , was induced weakly at  <dig> hpi . this expression profile is similar to that reported by feterl et al.  <cit>  in b. pseudomallei-infected raw <dig>  macrophages.

engagement of tlrs upon b. pseudomallei infection subsequently altered various immune responses particularly the inflammation related genes. these include the pro-inflammatory mediators , colony stimulating factor  <dig> ), the chemokines , and the ifn-stimulated genes  , the ifn-inducible chemokine genes ). genes that activated the immune response included the nfκb family members and their co-activator b-cell leukemia , and the activator protein- <dig> components ), while factors that mediate the effects of ifn   <dig>  irf <dig>  irf <dig>  signal transducer and activator of transcription   <dig>  stat <dig>  stat3) were also up-regulated in response to infection. of note, in the spleen, many of these inflammatory genes were highly elevated at  <dig> hpi, peaked at  <dig> hpi, followed by a drastic decline at  <dig> hpi . these include the ifnγ, the chemokines cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> which are important for neutrophil migration and mobilization; as well as gcsf, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and il <dig> . the relative expression of selected differentially regulated host-cell genes was analysed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction  on the same samples as those analysed by microarray analysis . the samples were verified by the qrt-pcr as up- or down-regulated, albeit with magnitudes different from those recorded by the microarray analysis.

genes that contribute to negative feedback loops that allow the cell to return to its inactivated state were also up-regulated. these include nfκbia and nfκbie which sequester nfκb proteins in the cytoplasm, suppressors of nfκb , tlr signalling negative regulators , interleukin- <dig> receptor-associated kinase  <dig> ), dual specificity phosphatase  family members  and the anti-inflammatory cytokine il <dig> .

suboptimal activation of complement cascade
activation of the complement system is important in defending against pyrogenic bacterial infection, bridging innate and adaptive immunity, and disposing of immune complexes and the products of inflammatory injury  <cit> . in this study, the genes involved in the complement system were mildly up-regulated in both organs although dominant in the spleen after  <dig> hpi. these include the complement component  <dig> , c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  cfb, properdin, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  surfactant associated protein d  and formyl peptide receptor involved in c3a anaphylatoxin receptor activation  . however, some key genes in the mannose-binding lectin pathway   <dig>  masp2) and membrane-attack complex   formation were down-regulated. a summary of the modulated genes within the complement system is shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  activation of complement can also be enhanced in a pathogen-independent manner by acute-phase proteins and triggered by the proteins within the coagulation or fibrinolysis pathways. the fibrinolysis related genes , plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor , plat, kallikrein   <dig>  klk4) were also elevated after  <dig> hpi in the liver. however, genes involved in the coagulation pathway  were down-regulated at  <dig> hr in the liver .

activation of caspases and cell death programs
several nod-like receptor  family genes   <dig>  nod <dig>  nlrp <dig>  nlrp <dig> and class ii trans-activator ) which act as intracellular sensors to detect cytosolic microbial components and "danger" signals were elevated upon infection . this subsequently triggered the activation of caspase  cascades to execute apoptosis and amplify the inflammatory responses essential in controlling intracellular pathogens. various caspases, including the subfamily of inflammatory mediator , the apoptotic activator  and the apoptotic executioner   <cit>  were up-regulated in response to infection. furthermore, the cell death associated genes , cd <dig>  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a , scotin, serine peptidase inhibitor, clade a , and anti-apoptotic factors baculoviral iap repeat-containing   <dig> and birc3) were also elevated in the b. pseudomallei-infected host over the  <dig> hr time period.

many gram-negative bacteria, such as salmonella typhimurium , pseudomonas aeruginosa , legionella pneumophila  and francisella tularensis  can induce caspase  <dig> activation and rapid macrophage cell death by inflammasome activation  <cit> . the caspase  <dig> dependent macrophage death induced by b. pseudomallei reported recently by sun et al.  <cit>  and the induction of il1b and il <dig> were also observed in this study. our expression profiles indicated that additional inflammasome-related genes were up regulated at  <dig> hpi. for example, genes encoding proteins involved in the nlrp <dig> inflammasome were up regulated: members of the cathepsin family , purinergic receptor family members , pannexin- <dig>  and autophagy related gene    <cit> . in addition, the type  <dig> ifn related genes  that are necessary for activation of the inflammasome in francisella novida-infected macrophages  <cit> , were highly induced over the course of infection and peaked at  <dig> hpi.

prolonged expression of acute phase responses may lead to tissue injury
acute phase proteins  are important in providing protective functions at sites of tissue injury  <cit> , however their maintenance over long periods may have negative clinical consequences  <cit> . the app isolate and neutralize the pathogen and prevent further pathogen entry while minimizing tissue damage and promoting repair processes, thereby permitting host homeostatic mechanisms to rapidly restore normal physiological functions  <cit> . numerous app , haptoglobin , phospholipase a <dig> , serum amyloid a ) were up-regulated during the b. pseudomallei acute infection. among these, family of saa  was highly induced throughout the infection period. saa mrna and protein synthesis are induced in vivo during the inflammatory response towards various challenges such as tissue damage, infection and trauma in all vertebrate species. however, prolonged expression of saa, and the consequent long-term production of the extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, may play a role in degenerative diseases  <cit> . this expression profile indicates tissue damage has occurred in the host, which can lead to induction of the ubiquitin system, peptidoglysis and proteasomal degradation. indeed, the ubiquitin d  gene required to label proteins for proteasomal degradation, peptidoglysis associated genes  as well as genes encoding the proteasome, a multi-subunit complex that degrades proteins targeted for destruction by the ubiquitin pathway, were significantly induced beginning at  <dig> hpi .

suppression of various metabolic pathways alters liver cellular homeostasis
gene expression profiles revealed a number of genes coding for various metabolic enzymes were down-regulated in the liver after  <dig> hpi. gene ontology identified that most of the suppressed genes were involved in oxidation reduction, organic and carboxylic acid metabolic processes, electron carrier activity, lipid metabolic processes etc. genetrail analysis revealed most of these genes including acetyl-coenzyme a acyltransferase 1b , acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase, medium chain , acetyl-coenzyme a acetyltransferase , aconitase  <dig> , aldehyde dehydrogenase , enolase  <dig> , enoyl-coenzyme a , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a synthase  <dig> , code for proteins involved in the amino acid metabolism pathways. the top ten pathways suppressed following b. pseudomallei infection are shown in table  <dig> 

cytochrome b has a crucial role in the activity of the bc <dig> complex, one of several complexes that contribute to energy transduction in the mitochondria  <cit> . surprisingly, a number of cytochrome b genes associated with phosphorylation-dependent pathways  and cytochrome p <dig> metabolism of xenobiotics were significantly down-regulated after  <dig> hpi .

many enzymes associated with essential pathways are modulated during b. pseudomallei acute infection. glycolysis is a central pathway that produces important precursor metabolites including glucose-6-phosphate and pyruvate. many of the glycolytic enzymes were significantly down-regulated, including phosphofructokinase , pfkp, aldolase  <dig>  a isoform , aldoc, phosphoglycerate mutase  <dig> , eno <dig>  eno <dig>  as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase beta , the key enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-coa for energy production via the tca  cycle . a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in the tca cycle were also down-regulated. in addition, the alternative pathways involved in producing acetyl-coa or tca cycle components such as the fatty acid metabolism, tyrosine metabolism as well as valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathways, were also down-regulated. the modulation profile of glycolysis and tca cycle in response to b. pseudomallei acute infection is summarized in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> 

discussion
individuals with acute melioidosis present symptoms rapidly and succumb to disease  before antibiotic treatment can be administrated  <cit> . previous studies on elucidating the pathogen-host response of melioidosis had focused primarily on a subset of immune response genes  <cit> , however, analyses of single gene or limited gene expression patterns is insufficient to dissect the host response to infection globally. we developed an acute melioidosis model in balb/c mice to get a comprehensive genome wide view of the host transcriptional response during the acute stage of melioidosis. our analyses clearly demonstrated that the pathogen had intimately engaged the innate immune system at the early onset of infection by rapid induction of numerous inflammatory responses.

the primary response observed was the overwhelming induction of tlr <dig> to counteract b. pseudomallei, which we propose, subsequently triggered the activation of many inflammation-biased genes important in attracting neutrophils and monocytes to the site of acute inflammation. these cytokines and chemokines also function as central mediators in activating various host defence systems such as apoptosis, jak/stat signalling pathway, mitogen activated protein kinase  signalling pathway and ultimately trigger the appropriate adaptive immune system. induction of these genes was previously reported in numerous in-vivo, in-vitro or melioidosis patient studies  <cit> . hence our study reinforces the consistency of the inflammatory genes expression in response to acute melioidosis. concomitantly, the host frontline defence system is boosted by increasing the production of granulocytes . nevertheless, the bacteria are capable of propagating in a tissue environment that is evidently overloaded with high levels of inflammatory-associated proteins . this genome-wide expression study confirms that the production of signals responsible for the activation of pro-inflammatory genes in response to b. pseudomallei infection, are mainly tlr <dig> dependent. this observation supports a previous finding of improved survival in respiratory infection in tlr <dig> ko mice with reduced bacterial burden and lung inflammation, as well as less distant organ injury  <cit> .

the cluster of inflammatory-associated genes consistently highly induced in response to b. pseudomallei acute infection is part of the group designated as "common host immune response". most of these genes are induced in many different cell types in response to exposure to several different pathogen species such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium tuberculosis, candida albicans, bordetella pertussis, mycobacterium bovis, p. aeruginosa and s. typhimurium  <cit> . up-regulation of this core set of genes by pathogens might represent a general "alarm signal" for inflammatory infections  <cit> . common host genes  known to be repressed by pathogens have been identified in pbmcs infected with b. pertussis, e. coli and s. aureus  <cit> . surprisingly in our study, these genes were highly induced in response to b. pseudomallei infection and could be a burkholderia specific response.

the reaction to a given pathogen must be sufficient for bacterial elimination but not so strong as to be harmful to the host  <cit> . this is particularly true for innate immunity in cases including acute melioidosis where excessive activation of inflammatory genes is commonly associated with septic shock. we did not see up-regulation in the levels of anti-inflammatory signals and tlr negative regulators at  <dig> hpi, suggesting that the failure to suppress inflammation at this early time point contributes to the excessive inflammation and acute nature of this infection. nevertheless, at  <dig> hpi, a significant decrease in expression of these potent inflammatory genes  was observed and may actually benefit the intracellular pathogen. however, the underlying factors that contribute to the decrease in expression of these inflammatory genes remain unclear as the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines  was relatively insufficient to counter the high pro-inflammatory responses at  <dig> hpi.

acute forms of melioidosis that lead to sepsis, multiple organ failure and death are thought to result from an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction that ultimately leads to excessive inflammation  <cit>  and eventually tissue injury in the b. pseudomallei-infected host. activation of proteasomal degradation following tissue injury suggests the production of immunological waste products such as apoptotic cells and immune complexes in the b. pseudomallei-infected host. this could be attributed to a failure in activating the complement system in time, leading to the accumulation of waste and uncontrolled spread of the pathogen . the low levels of the potent anaphyatoxin c5a observed in our study most likely inhibit the downstream terminal complement pathway. as a result, deficient rapid clearance of apoptotic cells resulting in extracellular disintegration of the cell and release of intracellular components triggers inflammatory cytokine production and contributes to "breaking tolerance" by facilitating an immune response to intracellular constituents  <cit> . this is the first evidence of failure of the downstream complement pathway in acute melioidosis.

the b. pseudomallei-infected host also over express many cell death related genes which suggests that the host initiates various cell death defence responses and disrupts cell regulation to limit a favourable intracellular niche for the pathogens. elevation of caspase  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as well as the bcl- <dig> family protein bid and tnf-receptor superfamily suggests that the host triggers apoptosis signalling via the death receptor mediated  pathway. in addition, we saw an up regulation of inflammasome related genes ) not previously reported in the b. pseudomallei-infected host. b. pseudomallei virulence factors such as type-three secretion factors , flagellin and channel forming toxins like hemolysin could trigger inflammasome-dependent caspase  <dig> activation  <cit> .

b. pseudomallei is known to interfere with inos expression in raw <dig>  macrophages and abrogate nitric oxide  production during the early stages of infection  <cit> . arginase  <dig> and arginase  <dig> have been reported to compete with no syntheses for their common substrate, arginine, and prevent no production in the m. tuberculosis infected bone-marrow derived macrophages as well as salmonella infected raw <dig>  macrophages  <cit> . here we report for the first time that b. pseudomallei up-regulates both arginase  <dig> and arginase  <dig> isoforms in the host with arginase  <dig> being more dominant. the expression profiles demonstrate both host nitric oxide synthase  <dig>  and arginase  <dig> were elevated at a similar magnitude at  <dig> hpi. this suggests that arginase competes with nos <dig> to produce no from arginine during the infection, leading to the suboptimal antibacterial effect of nos <dig> in the b. pseudomallei-infected host.

certain pathogens evade the host defence by triggering the tlr2-mediated biased anti-inflammatory effects or prevent recognition by tlrs  <cit> . for example, yersinia- and candida-induced tlr <dig> signalling leads to the release of il- <dig>  which can lead to immunosuppression. however, the response following recognition of b. pseudomallei via the tlr <dig> signalling pathway is contrary to the evasion mechanism exploited by yersina spp. and candida spp. in addition, some pathogens have developed strategies to either block or avoid their recognition by tlrs and subsequent activation of the innate defence. this study suggests that b. pseudomallei may use specific tlr-mediated signals to escape from the host defence. future studies will be aimed at determining whether b. pseudomallei utilizes these signals to evade tlr clearance mechanisms.

tissue injury leads to extracellular matrix breakdown, including the degradation of hyaluronic acid  and resulting oligosaccharides. in this study, the gene encoding hyaluronan synthase  <dig> , the enzyme that produces ha, was induced. in contrast, the genes encoding hyaluronoglucosaminidases , the enzymes that degrade ha, were repressed, indicating that perhaps ha is not degraded during a b. pseudomallei infection. these endogenous signals can also trigger tlr <dig> and/or tlr <dig> activation and signals distinct from microbial stimulators, for instance ha but not lps, signal through tlr <dig>  md <dig>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . up regulation of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> as well as md <dig> could indicate b. pseudomallei-infected host responses to endogenous signals released during tissue damage  <cit> . however, the ability of the engaged tlrs to distinguish between microbial and endogenous signals and subsequently trigger appropriate responses, remains unclear  <cit> . these observations reflect that the inflammatory response may cause more damage to the host than the microbe. in summary, our work has provided an extensive description of host defence responses to b. pseudomallei during an acute infection.

changes in host cell metabolism as a consequence of nutrient scavenging by intracellular b. pseudomallei have never been studied. the microarray data presented here provides the first description of changes in the b. pseudomallei-infected host cell metabolism particularly the glycolytic and tca pathways. the glycolysis pathway and the tca cycle were both transcriptionally repressed. it remains to be determined if shutting down both these pathways is part of the host response to control the replication of intracellular bacteria or a strategy adopted by the pathogen to survive intracellularly. in addition, we found that expression of  <dig> cytochrome p450-related genes was suppressed in the liver over the course of infection, most notably at  <dig> hpi. the expression of the detoxification enzymes amine udp-glucuronosyltransferases  and n-sulfotransferase  was also down-regulated. our data suggests that b. pseudomallei-induced impaired liver detoxifying activity might be a causative factor in liver sepsis. collectively, the data presented here suggests that hepatocytes, via receptors for many pro-inflammatory cytokines, modify their metabolic pathways  in response to b. pseudomallei acute infection.

CONCLUSIONS
this genome wide expression profile demonstrates that a general "alarm signal" of infection is triggered by the host upon infection with b. pseudomallei and subsequently various defence programs are activated to control the replication of the intracellular pathogen. nevertheless, the overwhelmed inflammatory response to infection as well as tissue injury leads to metabolic disturbances and homeostatic imbalance which is detrimental to the host. the suboptimal complement function correlates with uncontrolled spread of the bacteria, a hallmark of the acute nature of this infection. in addition, we postulate tissue damage following b. pseudomallei acute infection is contributing to dysregulation of the innate immune response via tlr <dig>  the surveillance receptor that recognizes both endogenous and exogenous molecules.
