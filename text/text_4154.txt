BACKGROUND
heterochromatin typically represents a large differentiated chromatin compartment within eukaryotic nuclei . while the mechanisms involved in molecular definition of facultative heterochromatin seem diverse  <cit> , the central role of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> di- and trimethylation  for the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin and heterochromatic gene silencing has been shown for drosophila, schizosaccharomyces and arabidopsis  <cit> . the majority of this heterochromatic h3k <dig> methylation is mediated by histone methyltransferases  of the su3- <dig> family . while the phylogenetic distribution of the su3-9-linked silencing pathway seems fairly broad, we note that so far all examined organisms have pericentromeric heterochromatin, which covers the main chromosomal distribution of the su3- <dig> protein in drosophila  <cit> .

the su3- <dig> encoding gene of drosophila melanogaster, originally isolated as dominant suppressor of position-effect variegation , expresses two distinct mrna classes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb  <cit> . these mrna variants emerge via 3' alternative splicing and have the first  <dig> amino acid residues of their open reading frames in common . the molecular analysis of mutants showed that the pev suppressor function is exclusively connected with the  <dig>  kb mrna which encodes su3- <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the  <dig>  kb mrna codes for the γ subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig>   <cit> .

in known non-insect genomes, both su3- <dig> and eif2γ are independent genes. su3- <dig> proteins bind to chromosomes in the nucleus, whereas eif2γ proteins are cytoplasmic and interact temporary with ribosomes. su3- <dig> orthologues are histone h3k9-specific methyltransferases. in contrast, eif2γ is a subunit of a g protein that delivers the methionyl initiator trna to the small ribosomal subunit and releases it upon gtp hydrolysis following the recognition of the initiation codon . despite their disparity in function and evolution, the drosophila genome database  <cit>  classified the two proteins as derived from a single gene.

here we studied su3- <dig> orthologues, mainly of arthropods, to understand the following issues of interest:  how far is the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion distributed phylogenetically?  how stable is this gene arrangement in evolution?  do su3- <dig> hmtases also exist in species with holocentric chromosomes , which do not contain pericentromeric heterochromatin?  how do the amino acid substitutions of drosophila su3- <dig> mutant proteins lead to deleterious phenotypes?

here we show that the natural gene fusion of su3- <dig> and eif2γ had taken place in the ancestral line of winged insects and silverfishs about  <dig> million years ago. we cloned su3- <dig> from a collembolan and a spider where both genes ancestrally exist as independent transcription units. in contrast, we found a su3-9-specific exon inside the conserved intron position 81- <dig> of the eif2γ gene structure in more than a dozen insect species which are members of eight different orders. however, the aphid aphis sambuci does not contain a su3-9-specific exon at any position of the otherwise conserved eif2γ gene structure. in the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, we identified non-functional remains of this su3- <dig> exon in the eif2γ intron, along with a novel, eif2γ-independent su3- <dig> gene copy. these pieces of evidence demonstrate an evolutionary re-fission of su3- <dig> from eif2γ in aphids. furthermore, we explored the phylogenetic distribution of su3-9-orthologous proteins by bioinformatic means and used the identified su3- <dig> protein sequences for phylogenetic analysis to uncover times of suv39h duplications occurred during the evolution of vertebrates. su3- <dig> chromo and set domains were compared to exploit evolutionary and mutant substitutions for the prediction of functional roles of distinct protein regions.

RESULTS
su3- <dig> gene identification, alignment and phylogenetic analysis
we cloned su3- <dig> cdnas from ten distantly related arthropod species, which are araneus diadematus , allacma fusca , lepisma saccharina , enallagma cyathigerum , forficula auricularia , acyrthosiphon pisum , cercopis vulnerata , apis mellifera , bombyx mori  and drosophila nasutoides . additionally, su3- <dig> sequences of  <dig> metazoan species, including  <dig> further arthropods, were retrieved by database mining. eight other su3- <dig> orthologues have been described previously  <cit> . with the exception of takifugu, tetraodon, oryzias , tribolium  and most drosophila species, all su3- <dig> genes are proved to be transcribed . by analysis of recent genome projects we found that the su3- <dig> gene is a single copy gene, except in most vertebrates and some nematodes. all nematode sequences were excluded from the sequence set, because the corresponding su3-9-like orfs showed highly divergent sequences. we also excluded all mammalian sequences other than homo and mus, because protein identity between these species is exceedingly high. in total, this led to the selection of  <dig> complete sequences in  <dig> species .

an alignment of these su3- <dig> proteins was obtained. during this step, the sequences from dictyostelium discoideum and hydra magnipapillata were excluded because these proteins do not contain a chromo domain. in hydra, this is proven by a translation stop signal in frame with and upstream of a putative start aug which is identically contained in three different ests. in the remaining alignment, positional identity was impossible to establish in areas located n-terminal of the chromo domain . therefore, these residues were truncated, leaving  <dig> alignment positions for analysis. the final su3- <dig> protein alignment  indicates that 21% of the included su3- <dig> amino acid residues are identical in 90% of the metazoan species studied. moreover,  <dig> residues  are identical in more than 50% of the proteins.

phylogenetic analysis was carried out using this alignment including all su3- <dig> protein parts except the common region with eif2γ and the region  <dig>   and implementing bi, ml, mp and weighbor methods . the weighbor tree, which provides additional branching information from the other trees, is presented . monophyletic groups of vertebrata, coleoptera, lepidoptera, culicidae and drosophila were strongly supported within all analyses. the groupings of diptera and mecopteroidea  also gained remarkable support. however, other arthropod taxa  were not consistently supported. suv39h of the chordate ciona branches as sister group of vertebrata in bi and mp analyses only . in spite of this, the tree dates the suv39h gene duplication previously found in man and mouse  <cit>  as occurred in the last common ancestor of tetrapodes. an independent duplication exists in danio rerio , designated suv39h1a and suv39h1b by us, which cannot be found in other teleosts as oryzias, tetraodon and takifugu. topology and branch lengths reveal a slightly relaxed purifying evolution during the early divergence of the paralogous genes suv39h <dig> and suv39h1b.

phylogenetic mapping of the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion
next, we undertook a mapping of major evolutionary transitions of su3- <dig> genes and proteins using commonly accepted phylogenetic relationships . accordingly, su3-9-like h3k <dig> methyltransferases might have gained the chromo domain in the common ancestor of fungi and animals, because the schizosaccharomyces su3- <dig> ortholog clr4p also contains this domain. if this is correctly inferred, the chromo domain of su3-9-like proteins got lost at least two times independently during the evolution of ascomycetes  and of cnidarians . alternatively, both bilaterian animals and an ancestor of fission yeast acquired chromo domains independently. interestingly, plant suvh h3k <dig> hmtases had gained a ydg domain instead of a chromo domain  <cit> . like classical chromo domains  <cit> , the ydg domain displays a strong interaction with the n-terminal tail of histone h <dig>  <cit>  and might, thus, be convergent to su3- <dig> chromo domains.

in bilaterian animals, the chromo domain appears obligatory for su3- <dig> proteins. however, there is a great variability in length and sequence of the protein region n-terminal to the chromo domain. we found that, in true insects , this protein region generally contains the n-terminus of the functionally unrelated γ subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor <dig> . moreover, we detected that in twelve genera of insects, belonging to the eight different orders zygentoma, odonata, dermaptera, hemiptera, hymenoptera, coleoptera, lepidoptera and diptera, su3- <dig> and eif2γ mrnas have identical 5'ends, encoding a common n-terminus of both proteins that is between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues long . in  <dig> out of  <dig> examined species of true insects, we gained evidence by genomic and/or cdna sequence analysis that a su3-9-specific exon is located inside the intron 81- <dig> of eif2γ . in each case, the expression of both gene products is regulated by alternative splicing. the common n-terminus of both proteins takes part in important functions inside eif2γ proteins  but does not constitute a closed globular domain  <cit> . in drosophila su3- <dig>  this common n-terminus might be involved in completely unrelated functions . the totally different role of the common n-terminus in both proteins led us to conclude that the fusion of the su3- <dig> and the eif2γ gene was a non-selected, accidental evolutionary event. therefore, it should have occurred only once.

on the other hand, we cloned non-fused, complete su3- <dig> cdnas and gene structures from araneus diadematus  and allacma fusca . we noted further that the eif2γ intron 81- <dig>  containing the su3-9-specific exon under fused conditions, was found in all examined hexapoda 3- <dig> exon) and in oniscus asellus  but not outside the pancrustacea  <cit> . thus, the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion has occurred in the common ancestor of winged insects and silverfishs after the branching of collembolans and may be a synapomorphy of the dicondylia or the ectognatha .

concomitantly, we got evidence that this gene fusion has become evolutionarily reverted at least once during the evolution of hemipterid insects. the complete su3- <dig> cdna and gene structure from the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum  was cloned. no similarities to eif2γ sequences were found in this su3- <dig> gene, and the 81- <dig> introns of the eif2γ genes of acyrthosiphon pisum and aphis sambuci do not contain a su3-9-specific exon. most interestingly, whereas the aphis intron does not show significant similarities to other genbank sequences, the acyrthosiphon intron reveals a residual similarity to su3- <dig> set domain sequences . in rt-pcr experiments, we did not detect any expression of this genomic region. we conclude that the fusion of su3- <dig> and eif2γ established in true insects was re-fissioned in a common ancestor of acyrthosiphon and aphis.

alternatively, the acyrthosiphon su3- <dig> gene might represent an unfused paralog, which exists beside of the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion in all true insects. three arguments render this hypothesis highly improbable.  we have cloned su3- <dig> independently of eif2γ from five genera of insects  and identified the connection with eif2γ in each case later.  we were unable to detect an additional, non-fused su3- <dig> gene in complete or almost complete sequenced genomes of six insect genera .  both introns found in the non-fused acyrthosiphon su3- <dig> gene are novel, because all introns identified in other metazoan su3- <dig> genes including the collembolan allacma fusca are located in non-homologous positions of the orf . thus, it is supposed that the aphid gene has acquired these introns after the fission of su3- <dig> from an eif2γ gene. therefore, we summarize that su3- <dig> represents a gene which was fused with and re-fissioned from a functionally unrelated gene during the evolution of insects.

molecular evolution and functional aspects of su3- <dig> protein domains
the conservation of the chromo, preset, set and postset regions shows that the corresponding domains has been subjected to strong purifying selection. in contrast, the regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the su3- <dig> alignment  reveal much less sequence conservation. whereas region  <dig> and  <dig> do not associate with any known function, region  <dig> serves, possibly together with the common region of eif2γ and su3- <dig>  as dimerization domain in drosophila and is involved in interaction with hp <dig> and su3- <dig>  <cit> . thus, the d. melanogaster n-terminus is essential for full enzymatic activity, which is obtained through su3- <dig> dimerization, and correct nuclear localization, which is dependent on interactions with hp <dig> and su3- <dig>  <cit> . at least the hp <dig> interaction seems to be conserved in the n-terminus of the mammal suv39h <dig> proteins  <cit> , however, there cannot be found conserved amino acid residues n-terminal of the chromo domain between insect and vertebrate proteins . a significant conservation of region  <dig> was identified only between su3- <dig> proteins found in species of the same insect order. the predict protein server  <cit>  predicts highly diverse, loop-rich secondary structures in this region, and a seg analysis  <cit>  detected repetitive sequence elements in region  <dig> of  <dig> out of  <dig> arthropod genera. thus, we argue that region  <dig> is only weakly evolutionarily constrained in insects. moreover, schizosaccharomyces clr4p and acyrthosiphon su3- <dig> contain only six or eight amino acid residues n-terminal to the chromo domain, respectively. together, these pieces of evidence constrict the functional conservation between arthropod and chordate su3- <dig> proteins to chromo, preset, set and postset regions, which does not exclude a random co-localization of functions in other regions of su3- <dig> orthologues.

chromo domains were detected in all bilaterian su3- <dig> proteins and in clr4p of fission yeast . functional analyses of diverse chromo domains revealed an unexpected diversity of interactions, including those with histone h <dig> tails, dna and rna . although the chromo domain is important for heterochromatic binding of su3- <dig> proteins in schizosaccharomyces, mammals and drosophila  <cit> , the exact target molecule of the su3- <dig> chromo domain is unknown. su3- <dig> proteins contain a classical chromo domain  <cit> , which is especially similar to hp <dig> and polycomb chromo domains. therefore, we have compared chromo domains of  <dig> su3- <dig>   <dig> hp <dig> and  <dig> polycomb proteins . we found that in three out of four conserved amino acid residues, which are essential for the specifity of hp <dig> binding to histone h3k9me  <cit> , su3- <dig> proteins show the same conservation as hp <dig> proteins as well as a conserved difference to polycomb proteins . in contrast, an arginine at position  <dig> of the chromo domain alignment, which is necessary for interaction with histone h3k27me  <cit> , is conserved only in polycomb proteins . both results argue for a histone h3k9me preference of su3- <dig> chromo domains. concomitantly, both alignment and tree branch lengths  infer a stronger chromo domain sequence conservation in hp <dig> than in su3- <dig> proteins. this might reflect a lesser affinity to histone h <dig> tails or a lesser discrimination between differently modificated h3k <dig> moieties, as compared to hp <dig> proteins. the latter opportunity was supported by pull-down assays using human suv39h <dig>  <cit> . thus, su3- <dig> proteins generally may be able to interact with histone h <dig> tails by chromo domains to facilitate and/or to locally restrict histone methylation. however, an interaction of the su3- <dig> chromo domain with heterochromatin-specific rna cannot be excluded.

the identification and characterization of point mutations in su3- <dig> of drosophila melanogaster which lead to differential hmtase activities  <cit>  demonstrated that the functional potential of su3- <dig> proteins is mainly determined by the kinetic properties of the hmtase reaction which is in turn dependent of set- and set-associated regions. we compared the structural conservation of these regions between su3- <dig> and other hmtases  which are proved to be histone h3k <dig> methylases  <cit> . su3- <dig> proteins contain only four persistent conserved sequence differences to these paralogous proteins: g <dig> 3-9) in preset, g <dig> in set-n, yddqgrt  in set-i, and h <dig> in set-c. we suggest that at least two of these conserved sequence deviations have interesting functional consequences.

first, whereas  <dig> out of  <dig> su3- <dig> orthologues contain a h <dig> in set-c,  <dig> out of  <dig> examined non-su3- <dig> h3k <dig> hmtases contain an arginine at this position. the homologous r <dig> of neurospora dim- <dig> is essential to permit trimethylation of histone h3k <dig> without intermediate release of h3k9-dim- <dig> binding, i.e. a processive type of reaction  <cit> . in dim- <dig>  an arginine to histidine substitution at this position decreases the hmtase activity below  <dig>  percent  <cit> . on the other hand, the activity of human suv39h <dig> can be increased by a reciprocal exchange of histidine to arginine to more than  <dig> percent  <cit> . it appears, therefore, that su3- <dig> proteins, in contrast to other h3k <dig> methyltransferases, are generally non-processive enzymes, as proved for d. melanogaster su3- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, ebert et al.  <cit>  identified the critical amino acid substitution  of the drosophila gain-of-function mutant su3-9ptn within the above mentioned yddqgrt motif. this gain-of-function mutant possesses a significantly increased hmtase activity that overcompensates amorphic mutations in drosophila heterozygotes. in summary, two su3-9-diagnostic conservations of amino acids in the set domain seem to suppress the hmtase activity of su3- <dig> proteins in comparison to other h3k <dig> methyltransferases. furthermore, we found a conserved phenylalanine , which supports that all su3- <dig> hmtases may be able to tri-methylate h3k <dig>  <cit> .

next, we analyzed  <dig> deleterious amino acid substitutions described for d. melanogaster su3- <dig>  <cit>  using the h3k <dig> hmtase alignment . we recognized that these substitutions fall into three classes . class i contains seven mutations exclusively found in totally conserved residues of preset and set-n regions of all h3k <dig> methylases. these substitutions typically show a null phenotype. the molecular functions of the corresponding residues can easily be drawn from structural analysis of neurospora dim- <dig> or schizosaccharomyces clr4p  <cit>  . in contrast, class ii contains three substitutions at positions which are conserved only in drosophila, six other substitutions that were detected in some wild type su3- <dig> proteins of other species, one  that was found similarly substituted  in the su3- <dig> protein of araneus diadematus, and one  that was identified similarly substituted  in some g9a proteins. class ii substitution positions, thus, show only a partial conservation and became probably compensated through nearby substitutions which have been determined . the molecular function of these residues was commonly not revealed by comparison with structural analyses of homologous proteins. class ii substitutions were found in all set domain-related regions and show hypomorphic or null phenotypes. su3-9ptn constitutes a third, hypermorphic class of mutants. notably, we found an identical r529s substitution in several wild type su3- <dig> proteins of other species, but it seems that there does not exist a local compensatory amino acid substitution . the r529s substitution may cause a higher hmtase activity of su3- <dig> proteins in those species, or become compensated by remote intramolecular changes.

finally, we were specifically interested in the su3- <dig> sequence of drosophila nasutoides. the d. nasutoides genome comprises  <dig> %  or  <dig> %  heterochromatin and represents by far the heterochromatin-richest genome of drosophila  <cit> . however, we did not find any peculiarities in the d. nasutoides protein compared with other su3- <dig> sequences.

discussion
to our knowledge, fusions of two ancestrally independent genes with completely different functions similar to su3-9/eif2γ have never been described so far. other known gene fusions are supposed to be positively selected because the resulting gene products are fused players of the same cellular pathway, fused molecular interactors or perform at least one novel function using an acquired protein domain. how, then, was it possible that two proteins as different as su3- <dig> and eif2γ in respect to sequence, structure, function, cellular localization and interactions were evolved to be derived from a single gene structure? northern blots in drosophila  <cit>  revealed that the eif2γ mrna is expressed strongly in each developmental stage, whereas the su3- <dig> mrna is expressed weakly during the first nine hours of embryonal development and almost undetectable during later stages. therefore, we hypothesize that the su3-9-specific splice variant of the su3-9/eif2γ gene "parasitize" on the strong expression of the eif2γ splice variant. the developmental changes of the su3- <dig> share in the su3-9/eif2γ primary transcript are unable to influence the eif2γ expression significantly because of the generally weak expression rate of su3- <dig>  under these conditions, it was possible that a su3- <dig> retrotransposition into the 81- <dig> exon of an ancient eif2γ gene has taken place and that this event has immediately resulted in a functional, alternative spliced gene. the only additional prerequisite is an activation of a cryptic splice site at the 5'end of the su3-9-specific exon, which has to be sufficient weak to not disturb significantly the eif2γ expression.

to determine age and distribution of the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion, we have cloned orthologues of both genes or of the gene fusion, respectively, in  <dig> selected genera of arthropods . we found that the fusion is restricted to ectognatha  and, possibly, to dicondylia  . according to palaeontological evidence with respect to the first true insect  <cit> , the age of this unusual genomic assemblage can be estimated to about  <dig> million years. irrespective of its long history, the gene fusion seems to impose a functional burden on the encoded gene products. in beetles and butterflies obvious splice artefacts, containing all exons of the fusion, are detectable  <cit> . the coding potential of these artefacts comprises all eif2γ exons under inclusion of the su3-9-specific exon, which renders the encoded protein functionally inactive, at least with regard to eif2γ. notably, the su3-9-specific part of the gene fusion consists in all analyzed  <dig> species of only one large exon . initially, this may have been caused by retrotransposition of su3- <dig> sequences into the eif2γ gene. afterwards, the establishment of internal su3- <dig> introns might have been suppressed by selection against abundant functionless or antimorphic splice artefacts, which would concomitantly decrease the expression of functional eif2γ mrnas. at the same time, the eif2γ part of the gene fusion has acquired at least four novel introns  <cit> , and the newly emerged acyrthosiphon su3- <dig> gene has gained two novel introns.

during this study, we found evidence for a reversion of the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion in aphids. the remnants of a su3-9-coding region in the eif2γ intron 81- <dig> of acyrthosiphon pisum reveal that these aphids descend from ancestors which harbored the gene fusion. because the cicada cercopis vulnerata possesses the fused gene, the fission of both gene parts has to be occurred during the evolution of the hemipterid group sternorrhyncha . it remains open whether a genomic duplication has happened, or a renewed retrotransposition of the su3- <dig> mrna.

the central role of the su3- <dig> histone h3k <dig> methyltransferase for the establishment of pericentromeric heterochromatin has been shown for mammals, drosophila and schizosaccharomyces  <cit> . our observation of su3- <dig> orthologues in holocentric species of insects  argues for an important role of the protein also outside of the pericentromeric heterochromatin, possibly in euchromatic gene silencing  <cit> , at telomeres  <cit>  and/or in chromosome segregation  <cit> . whether su3- <dig> proteins are involved in the establishment of heterochromatic regions in aphid chromosomes, which are mostly limited to telomeres and x chromosomes , remains to be seen. additionally, it would be interesting to evaluate function and nuclear distribution of a su3- <dig> ortholog in the coccid model system planococcus citri, where h3k <dig> methylation is found exclusively in the paternally imprinted chromosome set  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our examination of the evolution of the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion revealed strong evidence for the establishment of this fusion in a common ancestor of dicondylic insects. because of the unrelatedness of su3- <dig> and eif2γ and the demonstrated broad phylogenetic distribution of the fusion, this gene structure is a reliable synapomorphy, but appears not to invoke novel functions of the gene products. therefore, we interpret this gene fusion as an event of constructive neutral evolution as proposed by stoltzfus  <cit> . the identified re-fission of this fusion during the evolution of aphids shows the vulnerability of this structure to evolutionary decay, probably due to duplication and partial degeneration.

our comparison of chromo domains and set domains from su3- <dig> and related proteins offers functional predictions concerning both domains in su3- <dig> proteins. su3- <dig> chromo domains are similar to hp <dig> chromo domains, which points to a potential binding activity to methylated k <dig> of histone h <dig>  set domain comparisons suggest less enzymatic activity of su3- <dig> proteins in comparison to other h3k <dig> hmtases. su3- <dig> proteins combine two motifs in one molecule, which are typical for structural  or enzymatic components  of chromatin. this raises an interesting question: are evolutionary attenuations of the chromo domain histone h <dig> binding affinity and of the set domain histone h <dig> methyltransferase activity necessary conditions to make su3- <dig> compatible to animal chromatin? domain swapping experiments may give an answer.
