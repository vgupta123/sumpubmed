BACKGROUND
as key representatives of the soil fauna, earthworms are essential in maintaining soil fertility through their burrowing, ingestion and excretion activities  <cit> . there are over  <dig> described species worldwide, existing everywhere but in polar and arid climates  <cit> . they are increasingly recognized as indicators of agroecosystem health and ecotoxicological sentinel species because they are constantly exposed to contaminants in soil. the earthworm species  widely used in standardized acute and reproduction toxicity tests belong to the lumbricidae family . e. fetida and e. andrei are two sibling species commonly found in north american composters and are sold commercially for fish bait. they have a life span of 4– <dig> years and are obligatorily amphimictic even though each worm has both male and female reproductive organs  <cit> .

like many other ecologically important species, genomics research in earthworms lags far behind other model species such as mus musculus and caenorhabditis elegans. in the absence of full genome sequences, expressed sequence tags  allow rapid identification of expressed genes by sequence analysis and are an important resource for comparative and functional genomic studies. ests are often generated from either end of randomly selected cdna clones and provide valuable transcriptional data for the annotation of genomic sequences. because of recent advances in biotechnology, ests are produced daily in large quantities, with nearly  <dig> million entries in the current genbank db est database . nevertheless, it is still a challenging bioinformatics problem to analyze and annotate the often short, redundant and yet error prone est sequences in an appropriate and efficient manner, especially when the genome sequence of the organism is unknown. recent years have seen some est projects undertaken with l. rubellus  <cit>  and e. andrei  <cit> , which have generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests, respectively . before this study, there were only  <dig> nucleotide and  <dig> protein entrez records found for e. fetida. in the present study, we cloned, sequenced and analyzed  <dig> ests from e. fetida. we used suppression subtractive hybridization-pcr  to enrich cdnas responsive to ten ordnance related compounds . this work is part of a larger effort to identify candidate molecular biomarkers for rapid, mechanism-based gene expression assays to supplement current acute and reproductive toxicity tests. the specific objectives of this study were  to isolate and characterize cdnas from e. fetida that can be used to monitor exposure to orcs, and  to make the e. fetida est information publicly accessible by integrating it to our web-based est model organism database  so that it can be shared with interested parties.

RESULTS
cdna library and est sequence analysis
we cloned a total of  <dig> cdnas from the two ssh libraries . we transformed and picked  <dig> clones from forward subtracted cdna pools and  <dig> from the reverse subtracted cdna pools. after running on 96-well gel electrophoresis,  <dig> clones were found to be false positives with no inserts or had more than one insert. we sequenced the remaining  <dig> clones producing  <dig> good quality sequences with an average length of  <dig> bases. we batch-deposited them in the genbank db est under accession numbers eh669363–eh <dig> and el515444–el <dig>  clone sequences that were too short  or of poor quality  were excluded from further analysis. the observed failure rate  is typical for high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . the deposited, cleaned sequences were further assembled into  <dig> clusters  on the basis of sequence similarity and quality. nearly 80% or  <dig> of the clusters produced were singletons, and 80% of the remaining  <dig> contigs  were assembled from  <dig> or  <dig> clone sequences . the highest number of sequences assembled into one contig was  <dig>  the most represented putative genes in our libraries are cd-metallothionein, cytochrome oxidase, chitotriosidase, actin, atp synthase, nahoda protein, lysozyme, scbp , ferritin, troponin t, lumbrokinase, and myohemerythrin .

comparative sequence analysis
we used the  <dig>  unique sequences to search non-redundant protein databases using blastx  <cit> . a total of  <dig> sequences  matched known proteins with cut-off expect  values of 10- <dig> or lower, among which  <dig>  had e-values between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>   <dig>  between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  and  <dig>  between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> . a total of  <dig> unique sequences had less meaningful matches . the remaining  <dig> sequences  had no matches. we also examined unique e. fetida sequences to determine similarity to the genes of four model organisms drosophila melanogaster, mus musculus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and caenorhabditis elegans. a total of  <dig> blastx matches were found for  <dig> e. fetida unique sequences  at the cut-off e-value of 10- <dig> . some e. fetida ests matched genes conserved between the four organisms. more than 50% of the matches came from the mouse genome, whereas only  <dig> matches were found in the yeast genome. these results suggest that earthworms may be more evolutionarily distant from the yeast than from the other three organisms.

functional classification
we adopted the gene ontology  annotation of the aforesaid four model organisms to interpret the function of the e. fetida ests  <cit> . each unique sequence of e. fetida was assigned the same gene functions of the best blastx hit genes  in these model organisms' genome. the assigned go terms for the unique sequences are categorized and outlined in table  <dig> , table  <dig> , and table  <dig> . a complete listing of all the go mappings is available in additional file  <dig>  the most represented molecular function is "binding" accounting for 51% of the total  <dig> unique sequences assigned with at least one go term , whereas those for biological processes are "cellular process"  and "physiological process"  . in terms of the final child go categories, the most frequently assigned biological processes are "protein metabolism" , "cellular macromolecule metabolism" , and "cellular protein metabolism"  under both cellular and physiological processes , whereas those for molecular functions are "hydrolase activity"  and "protein binding"  . the largest subcategory in cellular components is "intracellular organelle"  under both the intracellular part and the organelle .

pathway assignment
we assigned the unique e. fetida sequences to a specific kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway based on their matching enzyme commission  numbers. a total of  <dig> unique sequences  including  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons matched enzymes with an ec number. fifty-eight unique sequences are involved in two or more pathways. the remaining  <dig> pathway-assigned sequences are mapped to only one pathway. eighty-two unique sequences  containing  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons were assigned to metabolism pathways . amino acid metabolism has the highest number of assigned pathways, followed by carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, translation, and signal transduction. genes putatively coded by a singleton ew1_f1plate05_b <dig>  and contig  <dig>  are most versatile, which are mapped to  <dig> and  <dig> pathways, respectively.

estmd  web application
the estmd is a highly performed, web-accessible and user-friendly relational database  <cit> . it facilitates and enhances the retrieval and analysis of est information by providing a number of comprehensive tools for mining raw, cleaned and clustered est sequences, go terms and kegg pathway information as well as a variety of web-based services such as blast search, data submission and sequence download. the application is developed using advanced java technology  and it supports portability, extensibility and data recovery. it can be accessed at . the workflow process is as follows: users input keywords or ids from the web interface and then submit them as a query to the server. the server processes the query and retrieves date from the backend database through the database connection interface. the results are processed and sent to the users in proper formats.

the main estmd tables are clone, contigview, est new, flybase, geneon, gomodels, pathway, term, uniseqhit, master_search and unisequence . main sequence information including ecnumber, labname, raw and clean sequence, and vector information are stored in the master_search table.

discussion
using ssh-pcr we enriched earthworm cdnas responsive to exposure of ten orcs that represent three classes of chemicals, i.e., nitroaromatics , and trinitrobenzene), heterocyclic nitroamines  and heavy metals  . exposure times varied from 4-d to 28-d to capture gene expression changes at different time points. in consideration of the magnitude of effort required by this study, we selected a single dose for each compound. we also believe that differentially expressed transcripts captured on the time scale may represent to a certain degree those manifested on the dosage scale, and vise versa. we chose time over dosage mainly because we are more interested in early indication of later effects. we purposely mixed the rna samples from different exposures for library construction because of the large variety of chemicals and exposure length, compared to the relatively small amount of resources available. the cloned cdnas may not represent genes responding to one specific compound because each chemical, especially each class of chemicals, is likely to have specific mode of action involving different genes. nevertheless, this library construction strategy served our downstream purpose of making cdna microarrays with the isolated cdna clones even though we cannot identify which cdna or groups of cdnas responded to which compound and at which exposure time point using the raw est data. the combination of ssh-pcr and cdna microarray analysis has been a widely used approach for identifying differentially expressed genes  <cit>  and characterizing mechanisms of action of known and suspected toxicants  <cit> , especially when there is no or little genomic information available for the test organism. our microarray studies have generated data enabling us to further identify differentially expressed transcripts and to elucidate sublethal toxicological mechanisms in e. fetida exposed to tnt alone  <cit>  or a mixture of tnt and rdx  <cit> .

it is worth noting that the comparative sequence analysis  and functional classification  based on go and kegg analysis only found a small portion of the ests highly homologous  with well-annotated genes. nevertheless, the functions of these ests are widely distributed representing  <dig> different go terms and  <dig> different kegg pathways. notably, genes putatively involved in carbohydrate, energy and amino acid metabolism, cellular processes of endocrine, immune, nervous and sensory systems, signal transduction, dna transcription, rna translation and post-translation splicing are identified suggesting that the ten orcs may have affected a wide range of important pathways.

from candidate biomarker gene point of view, we found repeatedly the existence of some toxicant-specific e. fetida mrnas in our libraries . for instance, the expression of metallothionein  mrna, the most abundant transcript in our cdna libraries, is reportedly a sensitive and early genetic biomarker of metal exposure  <cit> . demuynck et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a single exposure to  <dig> mg cd/kg of dry soil for  <dig> day induced mt mrna. brulle et al.  <cit>  observed changes in mt mrna expression as early as  <dig> hr after exposure. there are also clear differences of mt gene expression between worms exposed to different cd concentrations   <cit> . copper is an essential element for the activity of a number of physiologically important enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase , cu/zn-superoxide dismutase , and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase . however, exposure to a toxic level of copper can not only induce mt for cu sequestration  <cit>  but also alter the expression of cox , sod and dbh genes . further research is required to establish dose-dependent gene expression in both laboratory and field conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presented a framework for cloning, analyzing and annotating differentially expressed ests from the oligochaete e. fetida. a total of  <dig> unique sequences were clustered from  <dig> good quality clones, among which  <dig>  share high similarity with existing genes in the genbank nr database. we assigned  <dig> go terms to  <dig> unique sequences based on their homology with the annotated genomes of four model organisms drosophila melanogaster, mus musculus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and caenorhabditis elegans. seven percent of the unique sequences were further mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways. all the sequence and annotation information is accessible at .
