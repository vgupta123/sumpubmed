BACKGROUND
biological sex is the product of genetic and hormonal programs activated during embryonic development, with the most striking gender differences occurring in the internal and external genitalia. biological sex is a core determinant of sex-specific behavior  <cit>  and also a major modifier of a variety of maladies including cancer  <cit>  and autoimmune diseases  <cit> . delineation of the determinants of biological sex could provide valuable insights into gender-specific behaviors, diseases, treatment responses and outcomes  <cit> . sex-specific differences in gene expression have been documented and they are hypothesized to reflect gender-specific development  <cit> . however, sex-specific gene expression appears to be the product of two distinct pathways: sex chromosome genotype   <cit>  and androgen-dependent programming during embryogenesis  <cit> . in contrast to established concepts of androgen programming in rodents  <cit>  it has not been possible to tease out the contributions of these two pathways experimentally in normal male and normal female humans since they always work in parallel.

disorders of sex development  are the product of chromosomal and hormonal abnormalities during development that result in genital ambiguity and incongruent combinations of gender-specific external genitalia, reproductive ducts and gonads in a single individual. therefore, dsd can serve as an "experiment of nature" to decipher the genetic and hormonal components of sex-specific gene expression in the human. genetic and hormonal influences on gender extend beyond the reproductive tract, modifying body proportions, hair distribution, gender identity, sex-specific behavior and many other features that also affect dsd patients clinically in multiple ways  <cit> . therefore, improved understanding of the architecture of sex specific gene expression may also contribute to better clinical assessment of dsd-patients. in the present study, we hypothesized that sex chromosome controlled gene expression and androgen action during embryonic development in the first trimester as documented by the clinical degree of genital masculinization after birth could be distinguished by comparing normal males and females to individuals with dsd having well-defined clinical, hormonal and molecular characteristics. because of simple accessibility, lack of overt organ-specific topography biasing gene expression  <cit>  and documented androgen receptor expression  <cit>  we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells  for genome-wide transcriptome analysis. our study is the first that profiles blood gene expression data in dsd individuals.

RESULTS
genome-wide transcription profiling
transcript profiles for  <dig> normal male and  <dig> normal female controls were measured using spotted cdna microarrays with more than  <dig>  cdna elements representing  <dig>  unique genes. the significance analysis of microarrays  procedure  <cit>  was used to identify  <dig> sex-specific transcripts  :  <dig> transcripts with higher expression in males  and  <dig>  with higher expression in females. gene expression across these  <dig> sex-dimorphic transcripts was analyzed across all  <dig> controls and  <dig> dsd-patients. the dsd patients were comprised of ten  <dig> xy subjects whose genitalia ranged from normal female to prader  <dig>  three  <dig> xx subjects with masculinized genitalia from high prenatal androgenic steroid levels due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia  and one prader  <dig>  <dig> x0/ <dig> xy subject. in addition, one normally masculinized  <dig> xy male with cah was investigated .

hierarchical cluster analysis sorted the subjects into  <dig> groups that directly correlated with the sex chromosomes . segregation of the  <dig> xx and  <dig> xy subjects into  <dig> major groups was driven by large differences in expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts corresponding to  <dig> unique genes . high expression of xist -specific transcript) and loc <dig>  characterized genetic females , while ddx3y  box polypeptide  <dig>  y-linked) and five additional y-linked genes characterized genetic males . rt-pcr confirmed abundant expression of xist mrna in two female controls  and in two  <dig> xx virilized cah-individuals  and showed an absence of expression in two  <dig> xy-controls  and two sex-reversed  <dig> xy dsd-females . rt-pcr also confirmed that ddx3y transcript levels were abundant in these same  <dig> xy individuals, but absent in the  <dig> xx subjects .

within each of the  <dig> xx and  <dig> xy groups were  <dig> subgroups that largely correlated with the degree of genital masculinization . the  <dig> xx normal female subjects clustered separately from the three  <dig> xx subjects with genital masculinization and cah based on differences in expression across  <dig> of the  <dig> sex-specific transcripts. similarly, the  <dig> xy individuals separated into a group comprised of normal males and highly masculinized individuals with dsd  and a group with predominantly female external genitalia, again based on expression differences across the same  <dig> transcripts. only two patients did not follow this pattern. subject p- <dig>  who clustered with phenotypic males, had  <dig> xy dsd and prader 1– <dig> genitalia due to an unclassified defect in androgen biosynthesis. subject p- <dig> had mixed gonadal dysgenesis due to  <dig> x0/ <dig> xy mosaicism and prader  <dig> genitalia yet clustered with phenotypic females. since mosaicism can vary between tissue compartments and since developmental genes may modify the site-specific expression level of the androgen receptor in the external genitalia  <cit> , some discrepancies between genital phenotype and systemic androgenization are not unexpected. using qrt-pcr, we evaluated transcript levels of fzd <dig> , since levels measured by microarray analysis correlated with genital phenotype . similar to the microarray experiments, mean fzd <dig> transcript levels were significantly higher in normal  <dig> xy-males and in strongly virilized  <dig> xx-cah females compared with normal  <dig> xx-females and  <dig> xy dsd-females .

influence of x- and y-chromosome genes
we excluded the  <dig> x- and y-linked transcripts that correlated with the two sex chromosome clusters and reanalyzed the samples by hierarchical clustering. with the remaining  <dig> sex-specific transcripts, subjects no longer grouped according to karyotype, but separated into  <dig> groups largely distinguished by external genitalia masculinization . four of the five highly virilized prader  <dig> dsd-individuals and all normal males clustered together as did the normal females and subjects with feminized external genitalia. the mean prader stage of the dsd-individuals excluding the normal controls was  <dig>  in the "female" group and  <dig>  in those that clustered with the normal males  . when we excluded all normal controls from the cluster analysis, dsd-individuals separated into the same  <dig> groups  indicating that the normal controls used for sam had not significantly influenced the clustering of the dsd-patients.

influence of concurrent sex hormone levels
at the time of collection of pbmc rna the  <dig> xy dsd-subjects with feminized genitalia varied widely in their sex steroid hormone status. individuals who clustered in the female  of figure  <dig> included pre- and post-pubertal normal individuals with intact steroid biosynthetic pathways and individuals lacking steroid hormones . this cluster also included gonadectomized  <dig> xy dsd-individuals on estrogen replacement, such as subject p- <dig> who showed normal adult female plasma estradiol of  <dig> pmol/l .

similarly, the phenotypic "male" cluster  contained normal postpubertal males  and prepubertal individuals . the prepubertal subjects p- <dig>  p- <dig> and p- <dig> had low serum testosterone levels compared with age – and male sex adjusted normal ranges at the time of blood sampling . subject p- <dig>  who was  <dig> xx and had a 21-hydroxylase deficiency usually resulting in high levels of androgenic steroids, had been treated prenatally with dexamethasone. despite having only slightly virilized prader  <dig> genitalia, transcript levels of the pbmcs more closely resembled phenotypic males, suggesting residual effects due to elevated adrenal androgens. one subject , born with prader  <dig> external genitalia due to 5α-reductase type ii deficiency and gonadectomized in early childhood, was on estrogens and gestagens at the time of blood sampling . therefore, the assignment to either the "female" or "male" clusters based on the  <dig> sex-specific transcript levels reflected neither pubertal status nor concurrent serum androgen or estrogen levels.

biological function of sex-specific transcripts
panther   <cit>  identified  <dig> named genes from the  <dig> sex-specific transcripts. compared with the ncbi homo sapiens reference list,  <dig> biological processes were significantly enriched  and included developmental processes, extracellular matrix, cell communication and several that are involved in proliferation . gsea   <cit>  was performed using all interpretable genes from normal males and females using  <dig>  gene sets from the molecular signature database .  <dig> gene sets were significantly enriched in males, one in females, of which the majority had been associated with proliferation, often in a context of cancer . interestingly, many of the sex-specific genes identified in our study have published roles in human cancer, including tfpi <dig>    <cit> , lum   <cit> , pdpn   <cit> , sdc <dig>   <cit> , esco <dig>    <cit> , ssx2ip   <cit> , ctgf   <cit> , mmp <dig>   <cit> . igf1r   <cit> , serpina <dig>   <cit>  and sept <dig>    <cit> . a subgroup of these genes function in dna damage repair, such as chek <dig>   <cit> , xrcc <dig>   <cit> , h2afx   <cit> , alkbh   <cit>  and dcc <dig>   <cit> .

discussion
differences in gene expression that correlate with gender can be dissected into a small set of sex chromosome genes and a larger set of genes that appear to be programmed by androgens, most likely during embryonic development. pbmcs from individuals with diverse well-defined etiologies of dsd including gonadal dysgenesis, defects of androgen biosynthesis, and high levels of androgenic steroids due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency showed strikingly consistent patterns of gene expression across  <dig> transcripts that correlated most strongly with the genital phenotype. expression across all  <dig> transcripts identified as differentially expressed between normal males and females allowed separation of pbmcs into four categories of "pbmc-sexes": chromosomal and phenotypical male, chromosomal and phenotypical female and two intersex constellations in which the chromosomal and steroid influenced transcripts were discordant. while it is possible that transcript profiling of a higher number of dsd-patients could lead to demarcation of even diagnosis-specific patient clusters, the consistency of the transcript profiles across the different diagnoses argues strongly that these four categories are relatively robust.

animal studies on rodents underlined the importance of sex specificity of the pattern of gh secretion and gh signaling involving stat5b for maintenance of a large part of sexual dimorphism of gene expression in the liver  <cit> . since human pbmc express the gh receptor  <cit> , this mechanism could have a potential influence on the genes detected in the present study. however, in contrast to the extensive sex specific differences in rats with males showing pulsatile gh secretion and females showing more continuous gh levels, data on sex specificity of gh secretion in humans is less clear. while age and puberty status but not sex are important determinants for gh secretion during growth and puberty  <cit> , there is other data showing that gh pulse amplitude but not pulse frequency differ between women and men in adulthood  <cit> . however, looking at the data of the current study, the correlation between gene expression profiles and genital masculinization was independent of the individuals' sex hormone levels at the time of expression profiling. puberty status, presence of gonads and sex hormone replacement did not influence expression across the sex-specific transcripts. additional gsea on transcription factor targets gene sets did not reveal sex specific enrichment of stat5b target genes in our study . therefore, we have no experimental evidence that sex specific differences of gh secretion or changes of gh secretion due to age or puberty could have influenced the sex specific gene set of the pbmc of our study. however, it cannot be excluded that a considerably larger set of investigated patients would allow the identification of some sex-dimorphic genes influenced by the gh signaling pathway in pbmcs.

genital masculinization is a direct consequence of early embryonic androgen action between the 7th and 12th week of gestation. our findings therefore support the existence of lasting programming of sex-specific genes implemented by presence or absence of androgen during the first trimester of embryogenesis. sex-specific gene expression patterns have been observed in other tissues  <cit> , yet the relative contribution of the sex chromosomes and androgen programming was unknown. based on expression patterns readily apparent in pbmcs, cells not usually thought to differ significantly between males and females, our data suggest that many of the sex-specific differences in gene expression are due to the influence of presence or absence of androgens during embryonic development. given the limited lifespan of pbmcs, the lasting changes in transcript programs due to androgens are likely embedded in progenitor stem cells of fetal leukopoesis. it cannot be excluded that some of the genes detected in our study also played functional roles in androgen programming of lasting pbmc expression patterns during embryogenesis. however, more research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms of long term hormonal programming, e.g., by studying the effects of androgens on embryonic stem cell differentiation  <cit> . whether such programming affects the stem cells of other tissue types is unknown, but highly likely.

in a previous genome-wide assessment of transcript profiles, we have identified transcripts differentially expressed in cultured genital fibroblasts from normal males and  <dig> xy females with androgen insensitivity syndrome due to inactivating androgen receptor mutations  <cit> . similar to the current study we identified a set of transcripts with reproducible differences in gene expression that correlated with the degree of genital masculinization. since subjects in those studies all had a  <dig> xy karyotype, the differentially expressed transcripts were almost certainly programmed during development and remained apparent despite serial passage of the fibroblasts in culture. interestingly, the overlap was restricted to  <dig> genes. in both datasets fzd <dig>  , ssx2ip, sdc <dig>  alkbh, spred <dig> , pycr <dig>  and tomm <dig>  were differentially expressed between the subjects with male and female genitalia. recent work by yang and coworkers  <cit>  in which  <dig> male and female mice were profiled confirms our findings that a significant number of genes differ between males and females. more importantly, as we observed in genital fibroblasts and pbmcs, the degree of overlap of the sex-specific genes between tissues was limited in this study. our work extends on that of yang et al by demonstrating that sex steroid induced programming accounts for the majority of the differences in gene expression between phenotypic males and females. taken together these data suggest that the sex chromosomes to a small degree and androgen signaling during development to a larger degree account for a large part of the differences in gene expression in different tissue types between males and females. furthermore, the influences of each of these differ significantly between tissue types as evidenced by the limited overlap in the sex-specific transcripts between tissue types. additional work will be necessary to test whether these differences in gene expression between analogous tissues between males and females underlie developmental, anatomical, and functional differences between the sexes.

our data also provide a framework for investigating differences in diseases between the sexes and could have future implications for risk assessment and disease monitoring  <cit> . pbmc expression profiling has been suggested as a diagnostic tool in that germline mutations in disease-causing genes could produce unique transcriptional signatures detectable in blood cells  <cit> . disease-linked expression profiles are likely to be modified by biological sex  <cit>  and might need to be accounted for when developing diagnostic tools. in addition, our data raise the possibility that lasting transcriptional programs that differ between males and females could underlie differential susceptibility to a variety of diseases. for instance, we observed a striking over-representation of genes involved in growth control and cancer in pbmcs between males and females. whether sex-specific gene expression could affect a tissue's transcriptional background and oncogenic potential or response to anti-cancer therapy is unknown, but merits consideration in light of differences in cancer incidence between the sexes and our new findings.

our data have relevant implications for understanding the biology of dsd as well as potential future applications in its management. in western societies, every schoolchild learns that "sex chromosomes" decide "who's a boy and who's a girl". our data broaden the view of what determines sex and gender by revealing distinct male and female transcript profiles that correlate with either the karyotype or the androgen milieu present during embryonic development. therefore, our data confirm the concept of long term androgen programming as established in rodent models  <cit>  for the first time on the level of the human pbmc-transcriptome. our data also reveal  <dig> categories of gene expression in pbmcs in individuals with dsd in which the karyotypic and androgen-programmed transcript profiles are discordant. based on our findings, it is possible that other transcript profiles in pbmc could be identified that correlate with sex or gender specific traits outside the genitalia. were that the case, it might be possible to specify transcript signatures that reflect sex-specific differences in tissues such as the brain and in turn mirror sex-specific behavior, sexual orientation or gender identity. if so, subsets of the sex specific genes of our study could serve as future transcriptional biomarkers in dsd outcome studies in order to develop novel diagnostic tools contributing to decisions on gender assignment in dsd children.

CONCLUSIONS
the sex chromosomes and the long term effects of the early embryonic androgen milieu as evidenced by the degree of genital masculinization in defined patients with dsd contribute independently to sex specific gene expression in pbmcs. this gives rise to  <dig> transcriptional categories of pbmc sexes: normal male, normal female and two "intersex" conditions with discordant alignments of the dsd individuals' genetic and hormonal sex signatures. this previously unknown architecture of sex specific gene expression in the human provides new perspectives for understanding the biology of sexual dimorphism in normal anatomy, physiology and behavior, its particular influences on diseases and its specific alterations in dsd.
