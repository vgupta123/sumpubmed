BACKGROUND
in the present work, replication properties of the c. glabrata genome were determined using high-throughput sequencing and chromosome conformation capture . replication origins were mapped and early firing origins were found to be clustered in the nucleus, suggesting some level of organization in the temporal replication program. when replication origins and termination sites were analyzed, no evidence for an enrichment of large tandem repeats near replication origins or termination sites was found. however, chromosomal rearrangements tended to be more frequent in late-replicating regions, suggesting that these regions may be more prone to breakage and rearrangement during replication.

genome replication is the preliminary and essential step to the reproduction of any living organism. to achieve that goal, a complex dedicated machinery has been set up and propagated throughout evolution. it consists of interdependent cis- and trans-acting factors, respectively replication origins and a protein machinery involved in the catalytic process of replicating dna. the identification of replication origins in eukaryotes started with the discovery that some autonomous dna sequences were necessary and sufficient to replicate a plasmid in the model yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . since then, genome-wide catalogs of autonomously replicating sequences  have been established in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , lachancea kluyveri  <cit> , lachancea waltii  <cit> , kluyveromyces lactis  <cit> , candida albicans  <cit> , and pichia pastoris  <cit> . however, not all arss function as bona fide chromosomal replication origins  <cit>  and a great deal of energy has been devoted, for the last  <dig> years, to the systematic identification and characterization of active chromosomal origins in yeast species, using different genomic approaches. microarray hybridization of genomic dna probes extracted at different stages during the cell cycle identified chromosomal origins and replication termination sites in s. cerevisiae , schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , and lachancea kluyveri  <cit> . other methods used to characterize replication origins include immunoprecipitation of origin-bound pre-replication complexes, purification of nascent-strand dna, capture and identification of replication bubbles , characterization of single-stranded dna regions  <cit> , or comparative genomics between closely related species  <cit> . more recently, an approach using deep sequencing was developed. synchronized g <dig> yeast cells were released through the cell cycle, and dna was collected at different predefined intervals and sequenced to a high enough coverage to distinguish between unreplicated dna  and replicated dna . this powerful approach was applied to three taphrinomycotina species, schizosaccharomyces pombe, schizosaccharomyces octoporus, and schizosaccharomyces japonicus  <cit> ; four saccharomyces sensu stricto species; and one hybrid  <cit> . it also confirmed origins that were previously identified in lachancea kluyveri by microarray analysis  <cit> . here, we applied a related approach to characterize chromosomal replication origins and termination sites in c. glabrata.

c. glabrata belongs to the nakaseomyces and its genome underwent the same whole-genome duplication that occurred in s. cerevisiae ancestors  <cit> . it is an opportunistic pathogen involved in epithelial candidiasis and bloodstream infections in immunocompromised patients  <cit> . adhesion of c. glabrata to human epithelial cells is mediated by a family of calcium-dependent adhesins, called epa genes  <cit> , more abundant in pathogenic species of this clade  <cit> .

in addition to epa genes, c. glabrata encodes  <dig> genes containing large tandem repeats called megasatellites  <cit> . these megasatellites are made of large motifs , tandemly repeated from three to  <dig> times, located in genes potentially involved in cellular adhesion to host cells  <cit> . at the present time, there is no clear explanation either for the presence of so many megasatellites in the c. glabrata genome, or for the mechanism leading to their formation and subsequent propagation, despite extensive phylogenetic analyses  <cit> .

the c. glabrata genome exhibits frequent genomic polymorphisms, including copy-number variations, chromosomal translocations, and formation of neochromosomes, some of them occurring within close proximity to megasatellites  <cit> . determining the complete replication program of c. glabrata may therefore improve our understanding of relationships between megasatellites, genomic rearrangements, and s phase replication.

RESULTS
identification of chromosomal replication origins and correlations to characterized genetic features
it was previously shown that c. glabrata does not respond to a-mating or α-mating pheromones  <cit> . it was therefore impossible to use this approach to obtain a homogeneous population of g <dig> cells, as can be done with other yeast species. centrifugal elutriation was therefore chosen to isolate small, unbudded, g <dig> daughter cells from asynchronously growing populations . approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were elutriated and resuspended in fresh yeast extract peptone dextrose  medium . after  <dig> min, the first time point  was collected and following samples were collected every  <dig> min for  <dig> min. fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analysis showed that approximately  <dig> % of elutriated cells had already partially replicated their genome because a peak corresponding to g <dig> dna content was already visible at t <dig> . this suggests that c. glabrata enters s phase before starting to make any bud, and that early origins probably fire soon after mitosis exit. single read sequences corresponding to dna extracted from time points t <dig> to t <dig> were subsequently mapped to the cbs <dig> reference genome. coverage for each nucleotide, at every time point, was plotted as compared to the coverage of the same nucleotide at t <dig> . several coverage peaks are already visible at t <dig>  corresponding to activated origins. coverage was monitored throughout s phase, until the dna content of the whole chromosome eventually doubled. for each nucleotide of the genome, a t <dig> value, corresponding to the time at which this nucleotide was replicated in  <dig> % of the cells, was calculated and plotted to identify replication origins . altogether,  <dig> origins were identified, spaced 31– <dig> kilobases  from each other . there was no visible correlation between gc content  and replication curves , origins being distributed independently of any apparent composition bias. when comparing timings of origin activation, two equal-sized populations were found, corresponding to two bursts of origins firing .fig.  <dig> sequence coverage during s-phase time course. the sequence coverage at each time point  for each of the  <dig> chromosomes, is shown. for each nucleotide  at every time point, relative sequence coverage is plotted  as the ratio of tn coverage over t <dig> coverage . early replication origins are visible as peaks in the first time points, and gradually disappear when regions between origins are being replicated

average genome-wide replication fork speeds were determined for early origins and were plotted according to their distance from origins . as expected, coverage tended to decrease with distance, because regions located far from an origin are replicated later. the average fork speed was found by linear extrapolation of fork rates  to the point at which fork rates become null . it was found to be  <dig> – <dig>  kb, corresponding to an average fork speed of  <dig> – <dig> kb/min, in the range calculated for s. cerevisiae   <cit> , l. kluyveri   <cit> , and s. pombe   <cit> .

all centromeres were replicated in the first burst of activation, by early origins. telomeres were replicated in late s phase following the second burst of origin firing , although one telomere  was replicated earlier. however, given sequencing incompleteness of c. glabrata subtelomeric regions, it is most likely that this telomere was actually replicated later on. centromeres were always located near the very first origin firing on each chromosome, except for chromosome a . note that both donor mating-type cassettes, hml and hmr, were replicated at approximately the same time and before the mating-type locus mat. histone genes were mostly replicated early during s phase .

replication timings of known internal chromosomal deletions and chromosomal breakpoints found in translocations  <cit>  were determined. interestingly, chromosomal breakpoints were located more often than randomly expected in late-replicating regions , suggesting that they are more prone to either breakage or unfaithful repair. this was not true for internal deletions, which were as often located in early as in late-replicating regions .

replication timing of megasatellites presented a bias for late regions , but when subtelomeric megasatellites were discarded, the remainder did not exhibit any bias regarding replication timing . one thousand independent random sets of non-subtelomeric megasatellites were simulated. their average distance to the closest replication origin was calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb, not significantly different from the observed distance to origins  or to replication termini . therefore, megasatellites do not appear to be linked to the close proximity of origins or termini.

different replication timings of chromosome c arms
in order to detect a possible bias toward early or late replication of a chromosome arm, similar to what has been described for l. kluyveri  <cit> , t <dig> were plotted for each chromosome arm separately. no significant difference was observed between left and right arms, except for three chromosomes, b, c, and g . chromosomes b and g were acrocentric . therefore, the observed difference in arm replication timing for these two chromosomes was probably due to the quasi-absence of origins in one arm. for chromosome c, however, the centromere was located three-quarters along the chromosome length, and its right arm replicated earlier. no difference in gc content was detected between left and right arms , as compared to what was observed for l. kluyveri chromosome c left arm  <cit> , presenting a  <dig> % gc enrichment and a much earlier replication pattern. because hybridization between yeast species and large dna introgressions are very common among yeasts  <cit> , it is possible that the two arms of c. glabrata chromosome c had different origins, explaining their different replication patterns. all chromosome c proteins were extracted and compared to naumovozyma castellii, kluyveromyces polysporus, and zygosaccharomyces rouxii complete proteomes. these three species were chosen because they are the closest sequenced species outside the c. glabrata clade  <cit> . proteome comparisons and clustering , showed no detectable evidence that c. glabrata chromosome c left and right arm proteins come from different phylogenetic origins. in support of this conclusion, mapping of ancestral centromeres by gordon et al.  <cit>  showed that c. glabrata cen <dig> is an ancestral centromere and synteny is conserved across it, a result hardly compatible with chromosomal fusion of two different chromosomes. it must be concluded that the difference in replication timing observed for these two chromosomal arms is therefore not due to different phylogenetic origins.fig.  <dig> replication timing of chromosomal arms. a for each chromosome arm, t <dig> are represented as boxplots. red: left chromosome arm values; blue: right chromosome arm values. b phylogeny of c-left and right arm genes. average z-scores of distances between c. glabrata genes and closely related yeast species are shown for each chromosome c arm. none of these distances was significantly different from the other . kp kluyveromyces polysporus, nc naumovozyma castellii, zr zygosaccharomyces rouxii




whole-genome identification of arss
arss were originally defined as dna sequences providing extrachromosomal maintenance of plasmids in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . since then, arss have been characterized in many yeast species . in order to identify c. glabrata arss, a complete genomic library of small dna fragments  was cloned in a plasmid containing the c. glabrata ura <dig> gene but lacking a replication origin . in a first experiment, the library was transformed in a strain in which ura <dig> was entirely deleted  and  <dig>  transformant colonies were obtained. plasmidic dna was extracted from these colonies and deep-sequenced. using this approach,  <dig> different dna fragments were mapped to the c. glabrata genome, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides  . in a second independent experiment,  <dig>  transformant colonies were obtained and  <dig> fragments were mapped, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt ,  <dig> fragments being common to both experiments. altogether,  <dig> dna fragments able to propagate a plasmid in c. glabrata were identified. given that  <dig> fragments were common to both sets of arss, we estimated that the c. glabrata genome should contain a total of 310– <dig> arss. during the second experiment, the library was also transformed in s. cerevisiae cells and  <dig> fragments were mapped .

arss were numbered on each chromosome, according to their position, from the left to the right telomere. ars positions were compared to replication origins, and the distance between each ars and the closest replication origin was computed. about half of arss  were found within  <dig> kb of a replication origin , with a majority of those within  <dig> kb . the set of origins close to these  <dig> arss were considered as bona fide origins and were used for subsequent statistical analyses. as a control,  <dig>  random sets of  <dig> dna fragments  were generated genome wide. the same number of random arss as compared to real arss was generated per chromosome, and their distance to the closest origin was calculated. the average result of these  <dig>  simulations followed a normal distribution  and was strikingly different from the observed distribution .fig.  <dig> ars capture and fitnesses. a distribution of distances between arss and replication origins. the observed distribution is shown in blue. the simulation of  <dig>  independent experiments is shown in gray . the dotted red line corresponds to the 3-kb distance limit that was chosen to define bona fide origins. b coverage of each ars at g <dig>  as compared to g <dig> . the dotted red line corresponds to a coverage ratio 1/ <dig>  arss with the highest g <dig> coverage are labeled. c same as b, but for g <dig> coverage of each ars , as compared to g <dig> coverage . ars autonomously replicating sequence



in order to estimate replication peak resolution, we amplified, cloned in a ura3-plasmid, and transformed in c. glabrata, eight regions of  <dig> kb surrounding origins in which no ars was detected. as a positive control, a bona fide origin on chromosome g containing an ars  was also cloned and transformed. growth of the transformed cells was estimated after  <dig> and  <dig> days, in liquid culture, at  <dig> °c, in synthetic complete  synthetic medium. the positive control as well as two plasmids showed normal growth in these conditions. two plasmids showed slow growth and would not have been detected in the ars capture experiment, and four plasmids did not grow at all . therefore, only two out of eight 4-kb regions surrounding a replication peak were able to propagate a plasmid, showing that peak resolution is above  <dig> kb, a conclusion already suggested by the average distance found between peaks and arss . this was confirmed by a second independent replication peak determination, in which average distance between bona fide origins found in both experiments was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb .

using the motif finder gimsan, we identified a 17-bp a/t-rich ars consensus sequence  common to the  <dig> dna fragments selected . this acs is similar to the core s. cerevisiae 11-bp acs  <cit>  and the 17-bp extended acs  <cit> , except for slight differences on three positions. when only the set of  <dig> bona fide origins was considered, a nearly identical motif was detected, with boundaries clearly visible . the same analysis was performed with arss extracted from s. cerevisiae. the motif detected was closer to the c. glabrata acs than to the canonical s. cerevisiae acs . however, when the b <dig> sequence was considered, particularly the wtw trinucleotide  <cit> , it was found to be more conserved in arss replicating in s. cerevisiae than in arss replicating in c. glabrata. altogether these observations strongly suggest that the requirement for the b <dig> box is weaker in c. glabrata, and that the information necessary to initiate replication is mostly contained in the  <dig> bp acs, in which some positions are more constrained than in the s. cerevisiae acs.fig.  <dig> ars consensus sequences. a

rdna replication
in s. cerevisiae, rdna tandem repeat units are carried by chromosome xii, which contains 100– <dig> tandem units per genome  <cit> . one ars is present in each rdna repeat unit , and is located between the 18s and the 5s rdna genes . in c. glabrata, rdna tandem repeat units are found on two different chromosomes, l and m, both in subtelomeric positions  <cit> . two arss were detected in s. cerevisiae, ars_l <dig> and ars_l <dig>  both falling in the same area as ars <dig>  between the 18s and 5s genes . coverage of the ars library before transformation was determined to be  <dig> ±  <dig> for ars_l <dig>  given that the library mean coverage was 9× , we concluded that this region was represented in  <dig> ±  <dig> copies in the genome. this figures the average number of rdna tandem repeat units in the c. glabrata genome, corresponding to 40– <dig> repeat units per chromosome. this number was slightly lower than in s. cerevisiae, but budding yeast contains an exceptionally high number of rdna copies as compared to other fungi  <cit> .

ars fitness
in order to determine replication efficiency of each ars, a sub-fraction  of the cell suspension, corresponding to a total  <dig>  pooled colonies collected in the first ars capture experiment, was grown for  <dig> additional generations in a medium selective for plasmid maintenance. dna was extracted from cells after  <dig> generations , or after  <dig> generations , and deep-sequenced. altogether,  <dig> independent arss were identified at g <dig>  and  <dig> at g <dig> . all arss found at g <dig> were already present at g <dig> and all arss present at g <dig> were already present at g <dig> . sequencing coverage of each ars at each generation time was considered to represent replication efficiency, because efficient arss should be more often represented than others. g <dig> coverage was plotted against g <dig> coverage and showed that  <dig> arss were more represented after  <dig> generations, nine of them exhibiting more than  <dig> -fold coverage . similarly, g <dig> coverage was plotted against g <dig> coverage, and showed that  <dig> arss were more represented after an additional  <dig> generations, eight out of the former nine arss still exhibiting more than  <dig> -fold coverage. the only ars that was no longer represented at g <dig> among the former nine was ars_k <dig> . mean sizes of mapped dna fragments were  <dig> ±  <dig> nt and  <dig> ±  <dig> nt for g <dig> and g <dig> respectively . this suggests that during the course of this competition experiment, plasmids that replicated more efficiently also contained a slightly larger insert size, probably to more easily accommodate the fixation of orc and mcm complexes  <cit> .

absolute fitness of a given genotype was defined as the ratio of the number of individuals with that genotype at generation n +  <dig> to the number of individuals with the same genotype at generation n. in replication competition experiments, efficacy of a given ars at a given generation was considered to equal the sequence coverage of that ars. hence, absolute fitness of each ars was determined as / <dig>  this was determined for the first  <dig> generations, as well as for the following  <dig> generations, and averaged. at g <dig>  absolute fitness ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for ars_k <dig>  similarly, g <dig> absolute fitness ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  for ars_k <dig>  and the average absolute fitness for g <dig> + g <dig> ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  for ars_k <dig>  relative fitness was calculated by giving the value  <dig> to the ars with the highest average absolute fitness, other arss being given proportional relative fitnesses between  <dig> and  <dig> .

table  <dig> summarizes locations and properties of the nine arss exhibiting the highest coverage at g <dig> and g <dig> . there was no obvious correlation with distances to the closest origin, only four arss out of nine being located less than  <dig> kb from an origin. however, they all exhibited a relative fitness ≥ <dig> % . hence, any of these nine arss would be a good choice for an efficient multicopy plasmid replicator in c. glabrata.table  <dig> general features of the c. glabrata replication landscape

chromosomal organization
in s. cerevisiae, early replication origins exhibit enriched tridimensional contacts in the nucleus  <cit> . in order to characterize whether this organization could be reproduced in another ascomycete, a genomic 3c experiment was performed on c. glabrata. as previously described for s. cerevisiae, the c. glabrata contact map exhibits a typical rabl pattern, with centromeres as well as telomeres presenting highly significant clustering  <cit>  . a contact score, reflecting the enrichment in contacts between regions of interest as compared to a null model, was computed for early and late replication origins   <cit> . early replication origins presented significantly enriched contacts, in contrast to late origins, similar to what was observed in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the association of megasatellites with subtelomeric regions resulted in a clustering effect, but megasatellites in non-subtelomeric regions did not exhibit any enrichment in contacts .fig.  <dig> chromatin organization of c. glabrata exponentially growing cells. a normalized genomic contact matrix obtained from an asynchronous growing population. the  <dig> chromosomes are indicated on the x axis. the color scale on the right indicates the frequency of interactions between two regions of the genome . red arrowheads centromere clustering. yellow arrowheads telomere contacts. b colocalization score  for dna regions of interest. the cs is the mean of measured contacts between dna regions. the boxplots represent the distribution of cs expected by chance, obtained with  <dig>  randomized sets of positions , whereas the red dot corresponds to the cs of each group of interest . statistical significance of colocalization is attained when the red dot lies above the random group distribution . c nucleosomal organization at bona fide origins. nucleosome signals  <dig> bp upstream and downstream of bona fide origins were aligned , the color code representing nucleosome density . the bottom curve represents the average value of nucleosome density. regular nucleosome spacing is observed, with a large depletion at replication origins . note that acs positions  were used, to increase resolution. d nucleosomal organization at all arss. nucleosome density around all acs positions were determined and also show a significant depletion. acs ars consensus sequence, ars autonomously replicating sequence



discussion
in the present work, we identified  <dig> replication origins and  <dig> arss in the pathogenic yeast c. glabrata. these numbers are comparable to those found in other saccharomycotina yeasts like s. cerevisiae , l. kluyveri , and l. waltii , but are significantly lower than in s. japonicus , in strain bg <dig>  and used to build a series of replicating c. glabrata plasmids  <cit> . a replication peak was found on chromosome f at position  <dig> , and an ars was detected at  <dig> – <dig>  . when both ars sequences were aligned,  <dig> bp were found in common between the two sequences. right in the middle of these  <dig> bp an acs was detected . the 17-bp a/t-rich acs detected here is very similar to the acs described for s. cerevisiae  <cit> , showing that despite the evolutionary distance separating these two yeast species  <cit> , binding specificities of orc/mcm complexes are probably conserved. this is consistent with a former study showing the high level of conservation of proteins involved in replication between s. cerevisiae and c. glabrata  <cit> . similarly, an a/t-rich consensus was found in l. kluyveri, l. waltii, s. paradoxus, and s. bayanus  <cit> , proving that orc/mcm binding specificities are also conserved over larger evolutionary distances. interestingly, a yeast species recently shown to be a interspecies hybrid  <cit>  contains two different sets of arss. at-rich arss are reminiscent of the s. cerevisiae type, whereas gc-rich arss seem to be more specifically associated with early origins  <cit> . analysis of  <dig> arss cloned from kluyveromyces lactis showed that the acs was longer  in this yeast species  <cit> . the authors proposed that although k. lactis have fewer arss than s. cerevisiae, the larger size of k. lactis arss allows them to encompass more features important for replication, making them more efficient than s. cerevisiae arss. it seems that c. glabrata, with its large number of arss, is closer to the s. cerevisiae paradigm than to k. lactis.

fragile sites and replication origins
fragile sites on metaphasic chromosomes in human cells are defined as regions of chromatin constriction or double-strand broken chromatid that occur when cells are grown in the presence of drugs impeding replication . the precise mechanism for fragile site expression is not fully understood. for the common fragile site fra3b, it was shown that fragility in lymphoblastoid cells was correlated to the lack of replication initiation in this 700-kb region, resulting in cells entering mitosis with an incompletely replicated fra3b locus  <cit> . for fraxa, a rare fragile site involved in the most common cause of hereditary mental retardation, fragile x syndrome, it was recently shown that the large cgg trinucleotide repeat expansion at this locus impairs replication fork progression coming from an origin immediately adjacent to the repeat tract  <cit> . hence, the current model postulates that chromosomal fragility is triggered by a paucity of nearby replication origins or by the blocking of a nearby origin by a specific dna sequence, leading in both cases to mitosis entry with incompletely replicated chromatid. in s. cerevisiae, it was shown that regions containing replication fork termination sites often contain genetic elements involved in fork pausing   <cit> . it was therefore suggested that these late-replicated regions would be favored sites for chromosomal breakage. in c. glabrata, eight chromosomal breakpoints that are commonly found between different strains have been precisely mapped by previous authors  <cit> . interestingly, chromosomal breakpoints are more often located near late-replicating origins , the only breakpoint near an early-replicating origin being a terminal truncation of chromosome f  <cit> . this suggests that c. glabrata chromosomes are likely to break more often in regions that may be incompletely replicated, owing to the late arrival of forks coming from late-firing origins. that observation will be interesting to confirm when more rearrangement breakpoints are precisely characterized to obtain significant numbers. in l. kluyveri and l. waltii, no association between synteny breakpoints and replication origins could be found, but the authors did not differentiate between early and late replication origins  <cit> , so it was impossible to compare our results.

histone genes and nucleosomes
highly expressed genes appear to be replicated early during s phase, in yeast as well as in human cells  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, histone-encoding genes are replicated earlier, on average, than the rest of the genome  <cit> . histone expression level is also dependent on replication  <cit> , suggesting that early duplication of histone genes leads to an early doubling of their mrna levels, ensuring efficient dna duplication and wrapping around histones of the rest of the genome. indeed, replication origins near histone genes were found to be highly conserved between s. cerevisiae and l. waltii  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, there are two copies of h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig> histone genes, whereas there is only one copy of h <dig> histone gene. in c. glabrata, there are also two copies of h2a and h2b histone genes, but there are three copies each of h <dig> and h <dig> histone genes. the third copies are named cghht <dig> and cghhf <dig>  respectively. our study demonstrated that histone genes are frequently located in early-replicating regions. cghta <dig>  cghtb <dig>  cghht <dig>  and cghhf <dig> were located around the chromosome c centromere, and cghht <dig> and cghhf <dig> were near the chromosome h centromere, all of them early replicating . h <dig> histone, encoded by cghho <dig>  was in an early/late region, whereas only two histone genes, cghht <dig> and cghhf <dig>  were in a late-replicating area. we conclude that histone genes are mainly located in early-replicating regions of the c. glabrata genome.

nucleosomes are known to be depleted in yeast promoter regions. this has been shown for several yeast species, including c. glabrata  <cit> . using nucleosome positioning data, we found that all  <dig> bona fide origins were located in nucleosome-depleted regions . the same observation was made for the  <dig> arss . this confirms that replication origins  are mainly located in promoter regions.

revisiting the c. glabrata cell cycle
generation doubling time was determined to be 79– <dig> min  in our experimental conditions . given that s phase itself lasts 20– <dig> min , roughly  <dig> h is left to complete the cell cycle until the next s phase. the observation that unbudded cells, freshly elutriated, already exhibited a  <dig> % increase in dna content suggests that the c. glabrata g <dig> phase of the cell cycle must be shorter than the s. cerevisiae g <dig> phase, with early origins probably firing shortly after mitosis exit. this may explain—at least in part—why c. glabrata is slightly more resistant to γ irradiation than haploid s. cerevisiae cells   <cit> . spending less time in g <dig>  c. glabrata would have more opportunities to repair lethal double-strand breaks using sister chromatids. this will need to be confirmed by additional dedicated experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
we determined the complete replication program of c. glabrata using two complementary approaches, deep-sequencing of synchronized replicating cells and ars capture. mapping of genetic elements to replication profiles showed that natural chromosomal fragile sites are clearly located in regions of late replication, suggesting that forks tend to collapse and break more easily in these regions. no correlation could be found between the replication program and megasatellites, suggesting that their formation and propagation might not be directly caused by replication fork initiation or termination. it is striking that the acs is conserved between c. glabrata and s. cerevisiae, despite their large evolutionary distance, suggesting that the same exact set of proteins is involved in replication initiation in both yeasts. finally, clustering of early origins in this yeast genome raises the intriguing question of the conservation of this genomic feature among other ascomycetes.
