BACKGROUND
molecular studies of angiosperm model plants have identified large numbers of genes that are expressed during stamen and pollen development. genetic analyses have revealed the roles of some of these genes in the specification of stamen identity, the regulation of anther cell division and the differentiation of anthers, the control of male meiosis, the development of pollen, and anther dehiscence  <cit> . pollen development in gymnosperms and angiosperms involves several similar developmental and physiological processes  <cit> . homologs to floral transcription factors in angiosperms have been isolated from gymnosperm strobili and characterized. for example, the b-class mads-box genes, which in angiosperms determine petal and stamen identities, and c-class genes that control the identities of stamens and carpels have been identified in conifers  <cit> . the norway spruce gene dal <dig>  belongs to the agl <dig> subfamily and dal <dig>  belongs to gymnosperm-specific subgroup were identified as other mads-box genes in conifers  <cit> . the flowering time gene, soc <dig> and leafy, and a class gene apetala <dig> have also been identified  <cit> . however, available information about transcripts that are expressed in the male reproductive structures of the gymnosperms is still limited  <cit> .

the gymnosperm cryptomeria is a monoecious plant that is distributed throughout japan and in some parts of china. cryptomeria japonica d. don is widely grown in japan because of its high productivity and utility. this species comprises 18% of the forests and covers 12% of the landmass of japan. however, allergic reactions to its pollen have become a severe public health problem in japan. a recent nationwide epidemiological survey found that at least 13% of the japanese population suffers from pollinosis due to pollen of c. japonica  <cit> .

the male strobili of c. japonica develop in axils of small branches near the tips of these branches. the primordia of male strobili are initiated from june to august and first become visible from july to september under natural conditions  <cit> . the development of strobili can also be initiated by treatment with gibberellic acid . the promotion of flower formation by exogenous ga <dig> occurs even in one-year-old seedlings in spite of the fact that formation of strobili usually requires around  <dig> years after germination under natural conditions  <cit> . meiosis of microsporocytes begins in the middle of october, and microspores are formed from late october to late november. differentiation of generative cells and tube cells occurs in december. the staminate strobili then remain in an arrested state of development until the following march when pollen grains are released. each male strobilus is oval, pale yellow, and close to  <dig> mm in length and  <dig> mm in diameter, and each consists of microsporophylls attached to a main axis. three to five rounded microsporangia develop on the lower surface of each microsporophyll. each microsporangium contains  <dig>  or more pollen grains, and as many as  <dig>  pollen grains may be produced in a single strobilus  <cit> .

large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags  should help us to clarify the overall expression of genes in the male strobili of c. japonica. some ests have already been derived from male strobili and from the pollen of c. japonica  <cit> . however, the numbers of ests were relatively small, namely,  <dig> from male strobili and  <dig>  from pollen, and most isolated cdnas were not full-length. in the present study, we constructed a full-length enriched cdna library using rna derived from male strobili at various developmental stages, and we obtained more than  <dig>  ests. we performed sequence-similarity searches using tblastx and blastx to compare the ests from c. japonica male strobili to sequences in uniprot, amino acid sequences from arabidopsis and rice , and est sequences from poplar, spruce and pine. we also identified ests that encoded mads-box genes, which play a variety of important developmental roles in plants. in this report, we discuss both the utility of full-length cdnas for gene discovery and the characterization of mads-box genes in c. japonica.

RESULTS
construction and quality check of a full-length enriched cdna library
we constructed a full-length enriched cdna library from male strobili of c. japonica at various stages of development. the mean length of the insert dna derived from  <dig> randomly selected clones was approximately  <dig>  kbp. we picked up  <dig>  clones  at random and sequenced them from their 5' and 3' ends. in total,  <dig>  sequences were obtained and processed for removal of vector sequences, low-quality data and contamination by genomic dna from e. coli. we retained  <dig>  ests, which encompassed  <dig>  sequences of 5' ends and  <dig>  sequences of 3' ends derived from  <dig>  clones. each est consisted of at least  <dig> contiguous nucleotides with a phred score greater than  <dig> . the average sequenced length of the ests was  <dig> bp. all sequences have been deposited in the dbest division of ddbj/embl/genbank. the accession number of each est is shown in additional file  <dig> 

a ests were assembled using the phrap program.

b contigs and singlets were grouped using the blastn program and then both 5'- and 3'- end sequences derived from the respective same clones were grouped together.

we analyzed the full-length cdna clones that included sites for the initiation of transcription of mrna. an additional g at the 5' end is observed in many full-length cdnas that are obtained by the biotinylated cap trapper method, which we used in this study  <cit> . among the 5' sequence in our cdna library derived from c. japonica male strobili,  <dig>   had g at the 5' end . the high percentage of cdna clones with g at the 5' terminus suggests that the relative level of full-length cdna clones in our library was high. the second nucleotide showed a strong bias towards purines . this observation is consistent with the fact that transcription usually starts at a purine in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . subsequent positions did not show such an extreme bias towards purines. our results suggest that most full-length cdnas had one additional g at their 5' termini.

the occurrence of each base was counted at each position.

to confirm the addition of g at the 5' end of full-length cdna clones, we compared the 5'-terminal sequences of cdna clones that encoded cry j  <dig> with genomic sequences, including the promoter and coding region of cry j  <dig>  that we determined in a previous study  <cit> . we found seven clones that encoded cry j  <dig> among the 5'-end sequences of  <dig>  clones. all seven of them were 5'-extended cdnas, as compared with three cry j  <dig> cdnas that we generated previously  <cit> . five of the seven had one g, one clone had two gs and one clone had tg at its 5' terminus; these nucleotides were not present in the corresponding region of cry j  <dig> genes . the comparison between these seven cdnas and cry j  <dig> genes indicated that full-length cdnas had one or two additional nucleotides at their 5' termini, with most clones having a single g.

we performed a blastx comparison of amino acids encoded by 5'-terminal sequences of  <dig>  cdna clones and proteins from arabidopsis. our analysis revealed that  <dig>  ests  exhibited strong homology to arabidopsis proteins . among these ests, the starting positions in the alignment of  <dig>  clones  were upstream of the initiation codon of the corresponding protein. we also performed a blastn comparison with nucleotide sequences of protein-coding regions in arabidopsis. we found that  <dig>  ests  derived from 5'-terminal sequences of cdnas exhibited strong homology  to protein-coding regions in the arabidopsis genome. the starting positions in the alignment of  <dig>  ests  were upstream of the corresponding coding region of arabidopsis. these results suggest that most of our cdna clones are full-length cdnas.

classification of ests
the assembly of ests can be expected to generate an overestimate of the actual number of genes represented since failure of ests to assemble can result from alternate splicing, differences in usage of polyadenylation sites, sequence polymorphism, and sequencing errors. levels of redundancy after est assembly have been estimated to range from 20% to 22% in previous studies of est collections  <cit> . to reduce redundancy, we compared all consensus sequences  using blastn after assembly with phrap and then we grouped both 5'- and 3'-end sequences derived from the same respective clones together. finally, our analysis indicated that ests derived from  <dig>  clones could be grouped into  <dig>  clusters as unique transcripts . the largest cluster contained  <dig> clones, but only  <dig> transcripts  corresponded to more than  <dig> clones. we found that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  transcripts  corresponded to only one clone and  <dig>  clusters  corresponded to two clones. the normalization step appeared to reduce the redundancy of our ests. mitochondrial and chloroplast rna sequences were not filtered, but they contributed one and three clones to the data set of  <dig>  cdna clones, respectively. no contamination by ribosomal rna was detected in the data set. figure  <dig> shows the functional classification of the putative proteins encoded by our ests, which was based on assignments in the cog database  <cit> . of the putative proteins derived from individual transcripts,  <dig>   were assigned to  <dig> putative functional categories by blastx .

sequence comparisons with other species
we found that  <dig>   of the  <dig>  transcripts encoded peptides that were significantly similar to those in the uniprot database,  <dig>   were similar to proteins in arabidopsis, and  <dig>   were similar to proteins in japonica rice at a blastx e-value of 1e- <dig> . when we compared our ests with sequences of ests from pinus, picea and populus by tblastx, we found that  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   transcripts included similar ests, respectively, at e-values of 1e- <dig>  a larger overlap was found in the case of coniferous species . we also compared the  <dig>  transcripts examined in the present study with ests that had been previously isolated from c. japonica, which included  <dig>  ests derived from cambium and surrounding tissues,  <dig>  ests from pollen,  <dig>  ests from male strobili and  <dig>  ests from other organs  <cit> . slightly more than half  of our transcripts did not exhibit any similarity  to ests that had been previously isolated from c. japonica. thus, the ests described in the present report contain novel information about protein-coding regions of the c. japonica genome.

functional analysis
we analyzed conserved domains using pfam  <cit>  as a database to predict the function of products of c. japonica transcripts. overall, we found that  <dig>   of the  <dig>  transcripts encoded proteins similar to members of  <dig>  pfam protein families . among these pfam families,  <dig> families are denoted "duf, domain of unknown function" and  <dig> families are denoted "upf, uncharacterized protein family". in total, products of  <dig>   of the transcripts from c. japonica male strobili were similar to members of  <dig>  pfam families when dufs and upfs were excluded. we found that  <dig>   transcripts belonged to only one pfam family,  <dig>  transcripts belonged to two families,  <dig> transcripts  belonged to three families, and two transcripts  belonged to four families . the most abundant protein families in male strobili of c. japonica corresponded to those most strongly represented in the genome of arabidopsis . similar earlier analyses indicated that these domains occur frequently in sugarcane and white spruce also  <cit> .

similarity of products of ests to stamen- or male gametophyte-specific proteins of arabidopsis
we compared our deduced proteins with stamen and male gametophyte-specific proteins in arabidopsis. referring to previous studies of arabidopsis, we identified amino acid sequences encoded by  <dig>  stamen-specific transcripts and by  <dig>  male gametophyte-specific transcripts in the arabidopsis database  <cit> . we found that  <dig>  stamen-specific transcripts and  <dig>  male gametophyte-specific transcripts of arabidopsis resembled  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, respectively, from male strobili of c. japonica, at a tblastx e-value of 1e- <dig> . table  <dig> shows the pfam domains that are found in stamen- and male gametophyte-specific genes of arabidopsis and the numbers of transcripts that correspond to the families of genes in male strobili of c. japonica. our results suggest that homologs of stamen- and pollen-specific transcripts of arabidopsis are expressed in the male strobili of c. japonica.

a  <dig>  transcripts were picked up on the basis of previous report by wellmer et al.   <cit> .

b  <dig>  transcripts were picked up on the basis of previous report by honys and twell   <cit> .

similarity of the deduced proteins to pollen allergens
we compared the peptides encoded by all the ests with known plant allergens in allergome  <cit> . table  <dig> shows a list of pollen allergens that are similar to the deduced proteins encoded by ests derived from c. japonica male strobili. proteins encoded by  <dig> transcripts  exhibited partial sequence homology to plant allergens, which included known allergens of c. japonica. this result suggests the possibility that unidentified allergens in c. japonica might exist in our est collection.

a the accession number of an est that exhibited strongest similarity.

b the e-value of an est that exhibited strongest similarity.

c total number of transcripts whose products were similar to the respective allergens .

families of putative transcription factors
transcription factors play important roles in the formation of floral tissues throughout organogenesis. to identify transcription factors, we first identified  <dig> pfam domains that encode transcription factors by comparing data in the attfdb   <cit>  with the domain annotations of arabidopsis proteins. as a result of a search for sequence similarity between ests from c. japonica male strobili and the  <dig> identified pfam domains, we identified a total of  <dig>  unique transcripts that encoded putative transcription factors, which could be assigned to  <dig> protein families . transcripts whose products resembled the c3hc <dig> zinc finger domain, myb-like transcription factor, and ap <dig> were abundant in the male strobili of c. japonica.

identification and phylogenetic analysis of mads-box genes
among the putative transcription factors, ten transcripts encoded mads-box proteins . in addition, we found another two transcripts whose products were similar to mads-box proteins with e-values < 1e- <dig>  we determined the entire sequence of representative cdna derived from each transcript . figure  <dig> shows the phylogenetic tree constructed from an alignment of the sequences of mads, i-, and k-domains. one cdna clone  did not encode a k-domain and it was classified as the cdna of a type i mads-box gene. six of twelve c. japonica mads-box genes were classified as def/glo/ggm13-like genes and two genes were categorized as tm8-like genes. the other three genes were categorized as ag-, agl6-, and tm3-like genes, respectively .

discussion
the genomes of gymnosperm species are usually large and replete with highly repetitive sequences. the haploid dna content of c. japonica was estimated to correspond to  <dig> pg of dna  <cit> . this value is about half of the mean value for pinaceae species  <cit> , but about eighty times that of the arabidopsis genome. est analysis is a low-cost approach to characterization of the coding component of the genome. ests derived from several tissues of c. japonica were analyzed previously  <cit> . however, most of the previously analyzed ests were not full-length. full-length cdnas are essential for the determination of sites of initiation of transcription and the functional analysis of genes  <cit> . in the present study, we constructed a full-length enriched cdna library from c. japonica male strobili at various stages of development. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a full-length enriched cdna library from a gymnosperm. in fact, the information of  <dig>  sitka spruce full-length cdna sequences were registered in genbank , but it has not been published. these full-length cdnas should be a valuable tool for gene discovery and analysis in gymnosperms. we found that 90% of our cdna clones included g at the 5' ends . the g at the 5' end of full-length cdna can be explained by the addition of c to the 3' end of full-length first-strand cdna in a non-template-directed manner by the reverse transcriptase  <cit> . our observation of bias towards g at the 5' end of cdnas is consistent with the addition of c to the 3' end of full-length cdnas. the sequences of 5' ends imply that our cdna library had been enriched for full-length cdna clones. we also found that the second nucleotide of most cdnas at their 5' termini was a purine nucleotide, which is common at sites of initiation of transcription in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . this result suggests that a purine nucleotide is common at sites of initiation of transcription in c. japonica as well as arabidopsis and rice. however, further studies about the comparison between genome sequences and the full-length cdnas are needed to identify the sequence characteristics around the transcription start site in c. japonica.

we isolated  <dig>  ests from either one or both ends of  <dig>  cdna clones. these ests were clustered into  <dig>  consensus sequences  by phrap. the redundancy is extremely low compared with assemblies of ests derived from other conifers. in previous studies, the assembly of  <dig>  ests derived from  <dig> cdna libraries from different tissues of white spruce resulted in  <dig>  consensus sequences  <cit> , and that of  <dig>  ests from wood-forming tissues of loblolly pine represented  <dig>  consensus sequences  <cit> . the normalization step in the generation of our cdna library contributed the high rate of gene discovery. we obtained  <dig>  transcripts after a round-robin blastn search and clustering of 5'- and 3'-end sequences derived from the same respective clones. we found that  <dig>  transcripts  did not exhibit any similarity in terms of predicted amino acid sequences to those encoded by arabidopsis and rice genomes or to those derived from pinus, picea and populus ests using blastx and tblastx . these results indicate that the ests generated in the present study have added to the known complement of gymnosperm transcripts.

we classified and annotated the transcripts isolated in this study . in our functional classification, categories with no concrete assignment, such as "prediction of general function only", "function unknown" and "unassigned", accounted for a large fraction of transcripts . among assigned pollen transcripts of c. japonica, close to 31% of the predicted proteins are involved in the synthesis and modification of proteins, which are categorized as j and o  <cit> . however, the percentage in those categories was only approximately 14% in the present study. the difference might be due to the large population of transcripts in the present study and/or to the specific characteristics of the male strobili of c. japonica. table  <dig> shows the functional annotation of the most abundant families identified in this study. protein kinase, cytochrome p <dig>  and the rna recognition motif were the most frequent domains. these domains are also present at relatively high levels in deduced products of the genome of arabidopsis. we also found that the numbers of transcripts that encoded certain protein families or domains, such as nad-dependent epimerase/dehydratase, the c3hc <dig> type zinc finger, the wd domain, aspartyl proteases and aldo/keto reductases, were larger than those that encoded the corresponding protein families or domains in the arabidopsis genome. in general, the degree of complexity of multigene families seems to be correlated with the size of the plant genome. southern hybridization patterns and comparative sequence analysis of conserved ortholog sets suggested that genomes of gymnosperms include complex families of genes  <cit> . our results suggest the increased complexity of gene families in c. japonica as compared to arabidopsis. since the number of cdna clones in the present study was insufficient to allow us to prove this hypothesis and since the complete sequence of each clone has not been determined, further studies are needed to clarify the complexity of gene families in c. japonica.

we also searched potential candidates for novel allergens in c. japonica. in previous study, we analyzed similarity of the deduced proteins encoded by ests derived from c. japonica pollen and known plant allergens, and found cdna clones that encoded proteins similar to six types of pollen allergens, eight types of food allergens and three types of latex allergens  <cit> . in the present study, we found  <dig> transcripts that encoded proteins similar to  <dig> pollen allergens including all of five known allergens in c. japonica . the major allergens in c. japonica are known to have similarity to pollen allergens of other plants  <cit> . the existence of numerous allergens in c. japonica pollen has been suggested but only a few antigens have been identified. these newly deduced proteins in c. japonica are potential candidates for novel plant allergens.

in this study, we identified  <dig> transcripts that encoded pfam domains of transcription factors, including those encoded by mads-box genes. in plants, mads-box genes are involved in various aspects of vegetative and reproductive growth, including the morphogenesis of flowers. plant mads-box genes are classified into types i and ii  <cit> . most of plant type ii genes have three more domains than type i, namely, an intervening  domain, a keratin-like  domain, and a c-terminal  domain. the plant type ii genes are divided into two types based on the intron structure, namely, mikcc- and mikc*-type genes  <cit> . the mikcc-type genes can be subdivided into several well-defined gene clades, known as 'subfamilies'  <cit> . we found twelve mads-box genes derived from transcripts from male strobili of c. japonica, one of which was a type i gene while the other eleven were mikcc-type genes. the mikcc-type genes in c. japonica could be subdivided into five subfamilies: def/glo/ggm13-, tm8-, ag-, agl6-, and tm3-like genes. to our knowledge, this is the first report to identify type i genes and tm8-like genes in a gymnosperm. functional characterization of type i genes in plants has been very limited to date. the type i gene in c. japonica  was most similar to agl <dig>  which is required for development of the central cell of the female gametophyte  <cit> . the functions of type i genes in reproductive organs in c. japonica remain to be determined.

the mads-box gene family has been subjected to a model of birth-and death evolution  <cit> . tm8-like genes have been found in rosids  and asterids  but not in arabidopsis  <cit> . a recent review noted that tm8-like genes exist in the basalmost angiosperms  and in magnoliids   <cit> . we found evidence for at least one tm8-like gene in cryptomeria . none has been reported in pinaceae to date, to our knowledge. these results suggest that tm8-like genes were established in the common ancestor of angiosperms and gymnosperms and that they have been lost relatively recently in some lineages. it seems likely that the rate of birth-and-death evolution of tm8-like genes has been high.

we identified six def/glo/ggm13-like genes in this study. def- and glo-like genes are known as b-class mads genes, which are key regulators of petal and stamen specification in model species of angiosperms, such as arabidopsis thaliana, antirrhinum majus, and petunia hybrida. ggm13-like genes are the sister lineage of the b-class genes and are, hence, also known as bsister  genes  <cit> . bs genes are expressed mainly in female reproductive organs and a member of the bs gene family is involved in development of the seed coat  <cit> . b-class and bs genes were treated as one clade in the present study. three genes  seem to be ancestral def- and glo-like genes, while the other three genes  seem to constitute a sister clade of b-class and bs genes. several gene duplications appear to have occurred in the lineage to cryptomeria after it diverged from other conifers.

the phylogenetic analysis of mads-box genes in the present study has implications for the evolution of gymnosperms. the phylogenetic tree of tm3-like genes indicates that the gnetales and the pinaceae are nested as sister groups and that cryptomeria is a sister of the gnetales plus pinaceae clade. a similar result was obtained for ag-like genes, but the bootstrap support was not very strong. our data support those in prior multigene phylogenetic studies that suggested that all conifers, with the exception of pinaceae, are a sister clade of the gnetales plus pinaceae clade  <cit> . the evolution and divergence of the mads-box family of genes has been studied extensively. however, most of the studied mads-box genes in gymnosperms were derived from gnetum, pinus, and picea  <cit> . the identification and characterization of mads-box genes in cryptomeria and other gymnosperms should help us to understand the evolution of the structure of mads-box genes and their roles in reproductive development.

CONCLUSIONS
we established a full-length enriched cdna library using rna derived from male strobili at various developmental stages, and we obtained  <dig>  ests that was grouped into  <dig>  clusters as unique transcripts. these full-length cdnas provide information on expression of genes during the development of male reproductive organs. our full-length enriched cdna library will be useful for large-scale gene discovery for studies of gymnosperm species.
