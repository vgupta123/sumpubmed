BACKGROUND
recent evidence strongly suggests that microglial activation plays a central role in the inflammation induced by experimental and human retinopathy  <cit> . microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system , is sensitive to minute changes in their microenvironment and is quickly activated. upon activation, they proliferate and become amoeboid phagocytotic cells that produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide , and reactive oxygen intermediates  <cit> . these factors are well known to induce neurodegeneration, although the precise mechanism is not fully understood.

recently, wang et al.  <cit>  reported that glycated albumin  significantly enhanced the production and release of tumor necrosis factor-α  from retinal microglia in vitro, suggesting that ga contributes to microglial inflammation in diabetic retinopathy. chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes, through the nonenzymatic glycation of free amino groups in proteins by glucose, leads to the formation of labile schiff base intermediates that undergo amadori rearrangement, leading to the relatively stable early adducts ketoamine or fructosamine . eventually, these amadori products form irreversible advanced glycation end products   <cit> . glycated albumin levels increase drastically under diabetic conditions, and the plasma levels of ga may vary from normal  to diabetic   <cit> . increasing evidence suggests that early glycated albumin is not just an index of glycemia or the precursor of ages. by itself, it may have direct impacts on cellular functions and thus may play a pathophysiological role in microvascular complications of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy  <cit> . glycated albumin accumulates in the diabetic retina  <cit>  and changes the local concentrations of cytokines, growth factors, and other bioactive molecules by binding on several cell types, such as retinal pigment epithelium cells  <cit>  and monocytes/macrophages  <cit> , and by inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines via the activation of protein kinase c , nuclear factor-κb , protein tyrosine kinase , and activator protein- <dig>  signaling  <cit> . therefore, ga may have important effects on the initiation and progression of diabetic retinopathy.

macrophage colony-stimulating factor  is one of the most important substances known to affect macrophage physiology. the binding of m-csf to its sole specific receptor, csf-1r, stimulates the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes  <cit> . moreover, m-csf is considered a key cytokine in the regulation of microglial inflammatory responses  <cit> . accumulating evidence suggests the up-regulation of m-csf accompanied by the strong and selective induction of csf-1r in activated microglia following brain damage caused by injury or disease such as brain ischemia or alzheimer's disease  <cit> . in vitro, microglial overexpression of csf-1r augments phagocytosis and contributes to the inflammatory response  <cit> . similar patterns of m-csf/csf-1r expression have also been reported in the diabetic environment, suggesting that m-csf/csf-1r signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic lesions  <cit> . the exact mechanism, however, is unclear.

given the small amount of information available concerning csf-1r expression by microglia in the diabetic environment, the regulatory role of m-csf/csf-1r signaling in microglial inflammation in diabetic retinopathy is unknown. in the present study, we sought to ascertain whether ga has an effect on retinal microglial activation, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as the expression of m-csf and its receptor csf-1r. furthermore, using exogenous m-csf and antibody neutralization, we assessed the combined effect of m-csf and ga on the proinflammatory response in primary microglial cells. our results indicate that m-csf acts as a costimulatory molecule to synergize ga-induced microglial inflammation via binding to its overexpressed receptor csf-1r in diabetic retinopathy.

RESULTS
morphology and characterization of cultured newborn rat microglia
after  <dig> to  <dig> days of mixed-cell culture, the microglia appeared in small colonies  of highly refractive cells above the basal macroglial layer. these round microglial cells or colonies were loosely attached to the macroglial monolayer; maximum proliferation was observed within  <dig> to  <dig> days. the purified microglial cells went from being amoeboid in shape to having a ramified shape, with a single long process and a small cell soma, over the course of  <dig> to  <dig> days. immunofluorescence analysis revealed that ox-42-positive microglial cells accounted for 95% of the harvested cells, whereas none of the cells was positive for gfap.

effects of various agents on microglial viability by mtt assay
m-csf-induced microglial proliferation in a dose-dependent manner was confirmed, in which the extent of microglial proliferation correlated well with the increase of the viability measured by mtt assay. in contrast to m-csf, ga didn't induce significant proliferation . furthermore, the microglial apoptosis was observed when the concentration of ga exceeds  <dig> μg/ml. in addition, the antibodies of either m-csf or csf-1r have no effect on microglial viability by mtt assay .

ga causes morphological changes in microglial cells
as shown in figure  <dig>  the unstimulated microglia had a ramified shape in vitro . in contrast, the ga-stimulated microglia was bigger and rounder, with the appearance of activated cells .

effect of ga on the expression of microglial iba1
iba <dig>  a microglia-specific calcium-binding protein and marker of activated microglia, is involved in motility, phagocytosis, and proinflammation in activated microglia via the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . in this study, we observed enhanced iba <dig> expression in ga-stimulated microglia compared with unstimulated cells. in addition, following  <dig> h of stimulation with ga, iba <dig> was translocated from the cytoplasm to membrane ruffles .

ga-induced release of tnf-α and interleukin -1β from activated microglia
following stimulation with  <dig> μg/ml ga for  <dig> h, a significant increase in the release of tnf-α was detected compared with the control group . moreover, ga induced the dose-dependent release of tnf-α, with a peak at  <dig> μg/ml . there was a slight increase in the release of tnf-α from  <dig> to  <dig> h; however, no statistically significant difference was found among the various groups . similarly, ga induced the dose-dependent release of il-1β. different from the release of tnf-α, the increase of il-1β following stimulation with  <dig> μg/ml ga was not significant compared with that in the control group until after  <dig> h . the release of il-1β peaked at  <dig>  ±  <dig> pg/ml following  <dig> h of stimulation with  <dig> μg/ml ga ; however, no statistically significant difference was found among the various groups . neither tnf-α nor il-1β production by activated microglia stimulated with ga could be prevented by the endotoxin binding polypeptide polymyxin b  at  <dig> μg/ml, a dosage previously reported to abrogate lps-induced effects on microglia  <cit>  .

ga-induced production of m-csf by activated microglia
m-csf production occurs via autocrine signaling in activated microglia. to determine whether ga could induce microglial production of m-csf, we analyzed the amount of m-csf in the microglial culture medium. after stimulation with  <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml ga for  <dig> h, a significant increase in m-csf release  was detected, compared with the control  .

ga-induced up-regulation of csf-1r and tyrosine-phosphorylation of csf-1r by activated microglia
previous studies showed that csf-1r expression is enhanced in activated microglia and that this up-regulation not only induces the microglial production of proinflammatory cytokines but also promotes the phagocytosis of amyloid β . we analyzed the effect of ga on csf-1r expression in microglia. csf-1r mrna was detected in unstimulated microglia; however, after  <dig> h of stimulation with  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> μg/ml ga, the level of csf-1r mrna expression was increased  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold, respectively .

to examine the effect of ga on csf-1r signaling, we incubated microglial cells with  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> μg/ml ga for  <dig> h, and then subjected them to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. our results indicate that both csf-1r and phosphorylation of csf-1r  was up-regulated by ga-activated microglia .

immunocytochemical analysis further demonstrated that ga induces the expression of csf-1r , as well as m-csf , in activated microglia. as shown in figure  <dig>  enhanced staining was observed in the ga-stimulated round amoeboid microglia, whereas weak staining was detected in the unstimulated ramified microglia.

inhibition of m-csf or csf-1r signaling suppresses ga-induced microglial inflammation
we next tested our hypothesis that m-csf/csf-1r signaling promotes the release of proinflammatory cytokines in ga-stimulated microglia. we neutralized the activity of m-csf or csf-1r by using anti-m-csf or anti-csf-1r antibodies. the neutralization of m-csf or csf-1r had no effect on unstimulated microglia; however, both antibodies decreased the release of tnf-α and il-1β from the ga-stimulated microglia .

m-csf augments ga-induced microglial inflammation
to further understand the combined effects of m-csf and ga on the proinflammatory response in microglial cells, we included m-csf in the microglial culture medium. m-csf alone did not induce cytokine release; however, costimulation with m-csf and ga for  <dig> h produced a significant increase in the release of tnf-□ and il-1β .

discussion
inflammation involving vessels and neural tissue occurs early in diabetic retinopathy, while excessive and persistent microglial activation is believed a major contributor to the inflammatory responses  <cit> . microglial activation occurs via a complex regulatory system involving multiple signals; however, the mechanism remains to be determined.

amadori-glycated proteins and the early nonenzymatic glycation of proteins are increased in diabetes and have been independently associated with microvascular complications  <cit> . as the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier  is a characteristic early event, the increased ga in plasma may penetrate from the compromised brb and accumulate in retinal parenchyma, influencing the types of retinal cells and molecular mediators that subsequently promoting the development of diabetic retinopathy  <cit> . our data suggested that in vitro ga activate microglia, producing proinflammatory factors. this event may be expected to occur in vivo, thereby aggravate the pathological inflammatory process. it was supported by the recent investigation that inhibiting the formation of ga would ameliorate the development of diabetic retinopathy  <cit> .

the ga used in this study was produced commercially less than  <dig> week prior and purified to exclude residual contamination with ages as described by baynes et al  <cit> . in contrast to ages, only a few studies have emphasized the role of ga, despite the fact that the amadori product is a major form of glycated proteins and the concentration of ga exceeds that of ages  <cit> . amadori-modification is structurally distinct from ages, and can bind to monocytes/macrophages via specific receptors  <cit> . these receptor proteins have been characterized and the amino acid sequence homologies were not found in any of the age receptors  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable that binding of ga to microglia via specific receptors rather than receptors of ages, induced microglial activation.

accumulating evidences showed m-csf is a key cytokine in the regulation of the microglial activation, proliferation and migration in cns  <cit> . moreover, the high-affinity binding of m-csf to csf-1r plays a role in mononuclear/macrophage-associated diabetic complications, including diabetic retinopathy  <cit> . our previous study provided the evidence that the vigorous expression of m-csf/csf-1r occurred in the early diabetic retina and a robust induction of csf-1r was observed on the activated microglia  <cit> . furthermore, as shown in the current study, primary retinal microglial cells express either csf-1r or m-csf, albeit at relatively low baseline levels. while they were exposed to gradient concentrations of ga, the enhanced expression of csf-1r signaling was detected in activated microglia, not only at the mrna but also at the protein level. this up-regulation is consistent with that as seen in vivo, and may be integral to diabetic microglial activation  <cit> . in light of the above findings, we hypothesize that m-csf signaling is a possible molecular pathway in diabetic retinopathy.

to further our understanding, we measured the amounts of tnf-α and il-1β, two important proflammatory cytokines secreted by activated microglia, in ga-stimulated microglial cultures treated with or without additional m-csf. our results show that m-csf enhances the production of proflammatory cytokines in ga-activated microglia. m-csf alone, however, did not induce the proinflammatory responses but proliferate microglia as shown by mtt assay. although theoretically, more cells due to m-csf treatment may contribute to more cytokine production, given the fact that this inducible proinflammation could be significantly inhibited by antibody neutralization of m-csf or csf-1r, and the fact that ga enhanced expression of m-csf/csf-1r by microglia, it is reasonable that this is quite far from the actual synergistic effects of the two agents. taken all together, we concluded that m-csf may be a co-stimulator with ga and that m-csf/csf-1r signaling exerts a synergistic effect with ga on the production of proinflammatory cytokines, not simply due to effects on cell proliferation.

astrocytes, a major source of m-csf in cns, can be induced to release m-csf by proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . however, note that m-csf is also secreted by activated microglial cells  <cit> . moreover, as determined by immunocytochemistry and elisa, the level of m-csf elevates in ga-stimulated-microglia. elevated m-csf expression could cause further reactive microgliosis, phagocytosis, and the release of inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, il- <dig>  and m-csf  <cit> . thus, the present study provides evidence for the roles of m-csf and its signaling cascade in activated microglia in response to ga stimulation, suggesting that m-csf is an important cross-talk mediator, involved in astrocytes, neurons, and microglia.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, it is evident that ga can induce microglial activation by stimulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α and il-1β in vitro. simultaneously, up-regulation of csf-1r on microglia may augment the overall inflammatory response by propagating the proinflammatory signal to nearby resting microglia and astrocytes. the binding of m-csf to overexpressed csf-1r seems to augment ga-induced microglial inflammation via autocrine and paracrine effects, which can be blocked by antibody neutralization. our present study demonstrate that m-csf/csf-1r signaling represents a further link between microglial inflammation and diabetic retinopathy and raises the possibility of specific therapies for targeting microglia-mediated injury in diabetic retinopathy. further work are required for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying m-csf/csf-1r signaling in microglia activation.
