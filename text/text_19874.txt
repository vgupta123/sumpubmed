BACKGROUND
understanding the diversity and evolution of male sexual traits is a major interest in evolutionary ecology  <cit> , and there is now substantial evidence that sexual competition has shaped these traits  <cit> . firstly, males compete for mating opportunities  and individuals who invest in secondary sexual traits such as ornaments or weapons are often better competitors and gain more mating events . secondly, in species where females mate with more than one male in the same reproductive bout, males compete to fertilize a set of ova through sperm competition   <cit> . in many cases, sperm competition can be compared to a raffle where the male probability to fertilize eggs is proportional to the relative number of sperm delivered by the male  <cit> . sperm traits such as sperm dimensions and characteristics can also increase the probability of fertilization through their impact on sperm mobility and viability  <cit> . such sperm characteristics can be considered as sperm quality characteristics and can also play an important role in the outcome of sperm competition  <cit> . consequently, sperm competition has selected for adaptations that increase both sperm quantity and/or quality. for example, in mammalian taxa, testes mass , a proxy of sperm quantity  <cit> , is strongly associated with different proxies of sperm competition such as social group size in bats  <cit>  or the percentage of within-litter multiple paternity in rodents  <cit> . moreover, although sperm quantity has been traditionally emphasized, recent studies testing simultaneously the contribution of both sperm quantity and quality on fertility have shown that, under some circumstances, sperm quality could be more important than quantity. for example, one study found that in the white-footed mouse , the probability of siring litters was more affected by sperm quality  than sperm quantity  <cit> .

the expression and maintenance of sexual traits involved in both pre- and post-copulatory competition are energy and time consuming  and are generally associated with various costs. for example, conspicuous secondary sexual traits often cause high predation risks  <cit>  and male investment in both pre- and post-copulatory traits decreases immune efficiency  <cit> . since males can allocate only a limited amount of resources to sexual competition  <cit> , theoretical models of sperm competition predict that, when the relative intensity of pre- or post-copulatory pressures change, males should modulate their reproductive investment between traits involved in competition for mating and traits involved in the production of high quality ejaculates depending on the expected pay-offs  <cit> . basically, when females are likely to mate with different males , males should preferentially increase their investment in ejaculate expenditure by decreasing the investment to pre-copulatory male sexually selected traits; whereas when female propensity to mate multiply is weak , males should predominantly increase their investment to pre-copulatory male sexually selected traits by decreasing the investment in ejaculate expenditure  <cit> . so far, evidence for such relationships at the inter-specific level comes mainly from two studies:  simmons and emlen  <cit> , who found in beetles from the genus onthophagus, that species with the steepest allometric slopes of horn size on body size also display the shallowest allometric slopes of testes mass on body size , and  fitzpatrick et al.  <cit> , who recently revealed a negative relationship between sexual size dimorphism and both baculum length and testes mass across pinniped species. although male development and maintenance of pre-copulatory male sexually selected traits other than body size or mass are costly , and can potentially covary with the expression of ejaculate characteristics , inter-specific studies involving male armaments or ornamental traits remain scarce. moreover, in this context, investment in sperm quality has never been considered, maybe because models of allocation to sperm competition according to the level of pre-copulatory competition are principally focused on sperm quantity  <cit> .

ungulates are well-suited to examine covariation between investment in sexual traits since males in this group face intense competition both to secure matings and fertilize ova and developed traits to increase their success under both pre- and post-copulatory competition  <cit> . the predominant mating system of ungulate species is polygynous  <cit>  and conspicuous weapons such as horns for bovidae and antlers for cervidae have been sexually selected in this group because they provide an advantage for males in gaining matings and ultimately increase fitness  <cit> . for example, in soay sheep  larger horns enhance the probability of being observed in consort, which in turn is related to mating success  <cit> . in addition, ungulate species where males face a high level of sperm competition have developed larger testes  <cit> , and sperm velocity is also likely to be under strong selective pressure since this parameter is directly related to variation in male fertility . moreover, it has been hypothesized that the level of intra-male competition and ultimately the relative investment in both pre- and post-copulatory traits could potentially differ between mating tactics exhibited by males in polygynous ungulates  <cit> . in the female defence mating tactic, males follow females and attempt to guard them during oestrus. therefore, male mating opportunities might depend predominantly on their dominance hierarchy and abilities to prevent other males from copulating with females mainly from the use of their weapons  <cit> . on the contrary, in the territory  defence tactic, males defend areas to attract females but do not monopolize females that can freely range over several male territories. as a consequence, the risk of sperm competition might be higher in species with territory defence tactic and males should increase their investment in ejaculate expenditure as predicted by a recent model of sperm competition  <cit> . thus, the variation found in ungulate sexual traits  could ultimately be the result of different levels of sperm competition between mating tactics exhibited by males.

in this study, we first use a comparative analysis on ungulates to test for covariation between male investment in weapon  length and male investment in sperm quantity and/or quality . we expect that the relative size of these pre- and post-copulatory traits should be negatively correlated  <cit> . then we tested the hypothesis that male mating tactic  can mediate the relative investment in these pre- and post-copulatory traits. following bro-jørgensen  <cit> , we expect species with a female defence mating tactic to invest in pre-copulatory male sexually selected traits at the expense of their investment in post-copulatory traits, while we expect the reverse pattern for species with a territory defence mating tactic.

RESULTS
regarding post-copulatory traits, no significant relationships between relative testes mass and sperm dimensions were observed . however, positive relationships between sperm dimensions were evidenced .

no significant relationship between relative weapon length and relative testes mass was found . however, there was evidence for a strong significant negative relationship  between weapon and total sperm length . although lengths of all sperm components  are significantly longer as total sperm length increases , only tail length was found to be strongly negatively associated with weapon length  although this relation was found to be significant only with the phylogenetic tree derived from bininda-emonds et al.  <cit>   . no significant associations were found between weapon length and head or midpiece length, nor between weapon length and midpiece volume . the taxonomic family had no effect on the evidenced relationships .

discussion
surprisingly, no evidence of covariation between relative weapon length and relative testes mass was found across ungulate species. however our results show evidence of a negative association between relative weapon length and sperm length. moreover, we found that allocation to pre- and post-reproductive traits is independent of the mating tactic.

the absence of a negative covariation between relative weapon length and relative testes mass contrasts with both theoretical predictions  <cit>  and recent empirical findings from fitzpatrick et al.  <cit> , who found a negative relationship between sexual size dimorphism and relative testes mass across thirteen species of pinnipeds. one possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between these two studies could come from a much lower intensity of post-copulatory competition in ungulates compared to pinnipeds as suggested by their small relative testes mass  <cit> . however, scrutiny on fitzpatrick et al.  <cit>  data reveals that the gonadosomatic index  of pinnipeds is very close to the gonadosomatic index of ungulates from our dataset  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in ungulates ; mann–whitney-wilcoxon test: w = 330; p =  <dig> ). therefore, the absence of a negative association between weapon length and relative testes mass in ungulates is unlikely to come from a lower post-copulatory sexual selection in this group, which is not surprising since evidence of female multiple mating in ungulates are now compelling .

our results further show evidence of a negative association between relative weapon length and sperm length across species of ungulates. when sperm components were analysed separately, this negative association was found only with the length of the sperm tail. in mammals, sperm tail length is correlated with sperm velocity  <cit> , which can potentially increase male fertilization success under competitive conditions  <cit> . therefore, although an increase in sperm length when the intensity of post-copulatory sexual selection increases is potentially adaptive, such negative covariation between sexual traits such as weapons and microscopic structures like sperm across species is striking and deserves to be studied in other groups before drawing any definitive conclusion. indeed, this is the first time that a relationship between pre-copulatory male sexually selected traits and sperm characteristics is documented at the inter-specific level although such covariations have been repeatedly investigated at the species level . for example, in coho salmon  males with more intense spawning colouration, in other words that allocate heavily in secondary sexual characters, had lower sperm velocities than males with less pronounced spawning coloration  <cit> . conversely, intra-specific studies have also documented positive relationships between secondary sexual traits and measures of ejaculate quality . however, a meta-analysis has recently failed to find a general pattern of covariation between pre- and post-copulatory traits  <cit> , suggesting that species ecological and biological characteristics might play a significant role on the direction and the strength of the covariation.

it is particularly surprising to observe a negative relationship between weapon length and sperm length while no association was found between weapon length and testes mass since testes mass is typically considered by far as the most robust indicator of investment in post-copulatory competition  <cit> . however, as emphasized by simmons and fitzpatrick  <cit>  in their recent review on the evolution of male fertility, caution is required before considering relative testes mass as an absolute proxy of sperm competition level. indeed, testes can perform functions other than sperm production and allocation in testes mass could be favoured even in the absence of variation in the level of sperm competition  <cit> . in ungulates, testes mass varies between monogamous and polygynous species  <cit> . however, following the male mating rate hypotheses  <cit> , polygynous species could have heavier testes than monogamous species as a result of a higher number of females to fertilize even in the absence of variation in the level of sperm competition. on the contrary, whether sperm characteristics respond to post-copulatory competition is still a debated topic, especially when, like in our study, no relationship between sperm dimensions and relative testes mass was found. even if studies reporting either negative relationships or no influence of sperm competition on sperm/tail length have prevented the emergence of a clear picture  <cit> , it appears that the majority of comparative studies performed over the past 20 years have reported positive relationships between the level of sperm competition and total sperm length . we thus cannot rule out that other post-copulatory traits such as sperm dimensions could respond to post-copulatory sexual selection  <cit> .

finally, preferential investment in pre- or post-copulatory traits could be obscured by variation in the pre- and post-copulatory selective pressures resulting from their mating tactics. indeed in the moth  mating tactic is associated with differences in ejaculate expenditure. moth males with female defence mating tactic have larger heads and thoraxes, have smaller testes and produce fewer sperm than males without female defence mating tactic  <cit> . however, our results do not show distinct pattern of allocation to pre- and post-reproductive traits according to the mating tactics. indeed, none of the pre- and post-copulatory traits investigated differ between mating tactics nor is the covariation between sperm dimensions  and weapon length affected by mating tactics. discrepancies between our predictions and our results might have at least two explanations. first, the classification of mating tactics used  might not reflect adequately the level of pre- and post-copulatory competition in ungulate species. for instance, in the great kudu , a non-territorial species, the level of pre-copulatory competition might be, contrary to our hypothesis, not so elevated since in this species males fight only occasionally  <cit> . conversely, the level of post-copulatory competition can also be high in species commonly classified as female defence mating tactic such as the white-tailed deer . indeed, in this species, dna microsatellite markers reveal that multiple paternities are widespread within litters  <cit> . second, in ungulates, males can show strong plasticity in their reproductive behaviour shifting from one mating tactic to another . in this study, we have used the main mating tactic generally associated with the species, but we cannot exclude that the degree of the occurrence of alternative mating tactics might exert selective pressures. for example, within a given species, individuals adopting a territory defence tactic are predicted to have large weapons and low testes mass while individuals adopting a female defence mating strategy are predicted to have small weapons and high testes mass. these individual variations in mating tactic might obscure the relationships between pre- and post-copulatory traits at the species level. unfortunately high quality data on reproductive tactics in ungulates are currently not sufficient to obtain a classification of mating tactics that would better reflect the selective pressures exerted on pre- and post-copulatory traits, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the absence of distinct pattern of allocation to pre- and post-reproductive traits reported.

CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal the absence of a negative association between pre-copulatory male sexually selected traits and relative testes mass. nevertheless, a negative association between pre-copulatory male sexually selected traits and sperm tail length was found. covariations at the inter-specific level between sexual traits or others are sometimes interpreted as an evolutionary trade-off  although such interpretations require extreme caution  <cit> . indeed, these conclusions are often based on the assumption that the quantity of resources devoted to the production and maintenance of sexual traits should be the same across species  <cit> . in ungulates, the variance in mass-specific metabolic rate appears to be small compared to other mammalian taxa  <cit> . therefore, the amount of resources that males can allocate to sexual traits is likely to be roughly similar between these species although fine scale measurements would be needed before drawing any definitive conclusion on the absence or presence of an evolutionary trade-off. further studies on the relative costs and benefits associated with investment in different sexual traits in ungulates , through for instance the use of experimental manipulations  and mating trials, are now required before drawing any conclusion on the presence of an evolutionary trade-off.
