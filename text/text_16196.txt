BACKGROUND
transcription factors  regulate gene expression in different tissues during various developmental stages in plants, thereby controlling agronomic and economic qualities of crops. tfs usually contain two different functional domains that are involved in dna binding and protein dimerization activities regulated by several mechanisms, including differential dimer formation  <cit> . basic helix-loop-helix  proteins constitute one of the largest tf families and are widely distributed across eukaryotic kingdoms  <cit> . bhlh proteins are usually classified into different subfamilies and subgroups based on sequences of their dna-binding or protein-binding domains, which are highly conserved among species . the bhlh domain generally contains approximately  <dig> amino acids and possesses two functionally distinct regions, a basic region and a helix-loop-helix  region  <cit> . the basic region, located at the n-terminus along with a dna-binding motif, comprises about  <dig> amino acids—typically including six basic residues  <cit> . the hlh region, containing two amphipathic α-helices separated by a loop region of variable length or sequence, acts as a dimerization domain and allows the formation of homodimers or heterodimers . in all bhlh motifs,  <dig> amino acids have been found to be highly conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals  <cit> . other than these conserved domains, bhlh proteins exhibit considerable sequence divergence. in addition, the nucleotides flanking the core element may play a role in binding specificity  <cit> .

according to their phylogenetic relationships and functional properties, dna-binding motifs of known bhlh tfs have been divided into six main groups  containing  <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . group a contains  <dig> subfamilies, such as atonal, d, delilah, dhand, e <dig>  hen, lyl, myod and twist, that can bind to e-boxes  of tf-regulated genes. group b comprises  <dig> subfamilies, including max, myc, mitf, srebp and usf, which are able to bind to the g-box . group c consists of seven subfamilies that possess both a bhlh domain as well as a protein–protein interaction region  binding to acgtg or gcgtg sequences. group d has only one subfamily, whose members all lack a basic domain. because these tfs can form heterodimers with bhlh proteins from group a, they are functionally related to typical bhlh proteins  <cit> . group e contains two subfamilies with pro or gly residues in the basic region that bind preferentially to typical n-box sequences   <cit> . compared with the other groups, group f proteins have divergent sequences and contain an additional domain for dimerization and dna binding  <cit> .

plant bhlh proteins have been well characterized only in arabidopsis, rice , chinese cabbage , tomato , nicotiana tabacum and salvia miltiorrhiza , where they have been divided into  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> subfamilies, respectively. phylogenetic analysis has shown that plant bhlh proteins comprise  <dig> subfamilies,  <dig> of which were present in the common ancestors of extant mosses and vascular plants  <cit> . investigations conducted in different plant species have revealed the wide and diverse array of biological processes in which these proteins are involved .

in this study, we investigated bhlh tfs in wheat  through a comparative genomic analysis. the aims of this study were as follows:  genome-wide characterization of bhlh tfs from wheat;  prediction of conserved residues of wheat bhlh tf genes;  analysis of phylogenetic relationships of wheat bhlh tfs and those of other plants;  chromosomal localization of bhlh tfs and identification of syntenic relationships with rice and arabidopsis; and  expression profiling of bhlh tfs by transcriptomic sequence, expression array and qpcr analyses.

methods
plant materials
chinese spring , cm <dig>  and a synthetic hexaploid wheat shw-l <dig> were used for expression pattern analysis of wheat bhlh genes at different development stages according to qpcr. all materials were offered by triticeae institute of sichuan agriculture university. root, stem, leaf and seed samples were collected from materials growing in greenhouse under a 16/8-h day-night photoperiod at 18 °c and 55–60% relative humidity in july to september,  <dig>  for chinese spring, samples included leaves and roots from seedlings at the five-leaf stage, 1-week-old whole seedlings, and germinating seeds at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after imbibition . samples of cm <dig> and synthetic hexaploid wheat consisted of leaves, roots and stems at the seedling stage and seeds at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 30 days post-anthesis . all samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c. total rna was isolated with trizol reagent  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the rna samples were stored at −80 °c. first-strand cdna synthesis was carried out using a prime-script tm rt reagent kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

rna sequencing  and expression array datasets for identification of bhlh tfs
wheat bhlh proteins identified from previous studies were downloaded from wheattfdb  and planttfdb v <dig>   databases  <cit> . bhlh protein sequences of rice and arabidopsis were obtained according to pires and dolan . housekeeping genes as expression references were obtained from ncbi and used to normalize the expression of bhlh proteins in wheat . for use in further analyses, we selected  <dig> rna-seq  data files with tissue or organ information at different wheat developmental stages from over  <dig> wheat rna-seq data files currently available in the sra database  . sequences of wheat cultivar chinese spring from the chromosome survey sequence data file popseq. <dig> dna  were used to analyze the chromosomal locations of bhlh tfs  <cit> . homologous genes of wbhlh were obtained from iwgsc  and tgac  databases. the 61-kb wheat genome array and expression profiling data in plexdb  were used to identify the expression of bhlh tfs.

bhlh domain structure prediction
for bhlh domain structure prediction, bowtie <dig>  was first applied to map rna-seq reads to the wheat genome sequences. cufflinks  was then used to assemble the mapped reads into the  <dig> rna-seq data files. the program cd-hit-est. was used to cluster redundant sequences , and the estate package  was used to translate nucleic acid sequences into protein sequences. redundant protein sequences were filtered out using the cd-hit program . hmmer v <dig>   was used to predict wheat bhlh tfs.

phylogenetic analysis and identification of conserved motifs
protein sequences were screened against the pfam database to identify domains of bhlh tfs. clustalx  <dig>  software was used to construct a neighbor-joining tree of wheat bhlh protein key domain sequences  <cit> . the identified bhlh domains were aligned using clustalx  <dig>  with default settings  <cit> . to identify conserved motifs in wheat bhlh proteins, meme v <dig> . <dig>  was used with default settings, except that the optimum motif width was set to ≥ <dig> and ≤ <dig> and the maximum number of motifs was set to identify  <dig> motifs. meme was also used to search for conserved motifs in the full amino acid sequences of bhlh.

gene ontology and enrichment analysis
annotation and identification of enriched pathways was performed using the kobas  <dig>  analysis toolkit   <cit> . the wego online tool  was used to perform gene ontology enrichment analysis of identified bhlh genes  <cit> . the blast program was used to compare the data from arabidopsis and rice, with genes subsequently removed on the basis of the following criteria: aligned amino acid sequence length >  <dig>  and % identity >80%. an interaction network associated with arabidopsis orthologs of bhlh genes in wheat was constructed using the arabidopsis interaction viewer and cytoscape  <dig>  software  <cit> . the string v <dig>  database  was used to identify protein–protein interactions of bhlh proteins.

chromosomal locations and collinearity of bhlh genes
the position of each bhlh gene on the  <dig> wheat chromosomes was determined by mapping bhlh gene sequences to chinese spring wheat chromosome survey sequences using blat and blast programs. the positions of arabidopsis and rice bhlh genes were also mapped. the identified positions were then marked on the chromosomes using the circos tool  <cit> .

analysis of bhlh gene expression in wheat
tophat  and cufflinks were used to analyze the expression of bhlh family genes in wheat. tophat <dig>  is a program that aligns reads to the genome and discovers transcript splice sites, while cufflinks <dig>  compares the generated map from tophat <dig> against the genome to assemble the reads into transcripts  <cit> .

rna-seq reads were first mapped to wheat bhlh family genes using tophat. the rna-seq reads for each biological replicate were mapped independently. these mapped reads were input into cufflinks, which produced one file of assembled transcribed fragments per replicate. the assembly files were then merged with the reference transcriptome annotation into a unified annotation for further analysis. this merged annotation was quantified under each condition by cuffdiff, which produced expression data as a set of tabular files. the tabular files were indexed and visualized with cummerbund to facilitate exploration of genes identified by cuffdiff as differentially expressed. after generating expression data in terms of fpkm   <cit> , we divided expression levels of bhlh genes by the average expression of the reference genes . we then combined the data using the ‘scale’ function in r  and used the pheatmap tool in r to draw a heat map of bhlh family gene expression levels in wheat. finally, bhlh tf expression data were obtained by combining genechip and expression profiling data from plexdb .

expression confirmation by qpcr
specific primers were designed according to bhlh gene sequences using primer  <dig>  software  . reference genes were used as an internal control to normalize the expression level of the target gene among different samples  <cit> . qpcr amplification was performed with sybr premix ex taq   using a myiq single color real-time pcr detection system .

RESULTS
characterization of bhlh tfs in wheat
in this study, we obtained  <dig> putative bhlh tfs with typical conserved sequences , among which  <dig> bhlh tf genes were common to this study and other databases . and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bhlh tfs were specific in this study, planttfdb and wheattfdb, respectively . to characterize sequence features of wheat bhlh tfs, a multiple sequence alignment based on protein sequences of these  <dig> tfs was generated. four typical conserved bhlh regions, namely, one basic region, two helix regions and one loop region, were detected in wheat bhlh tfs . the first helix region had five conserved residues , while the second helix region comprised seven . the loop region possessed only two conserved residues . the basic region contained five conserved residues . although the basic region was the most conserved bhlh tf region,  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins did not contain it. the loop region was found to be the most divergent in terms of both length and amino acid composition . according to the sequence alignment data,  <dig> conserved amino acid residues were found in more than  <dig> wheat bhlh tfs . among these residues, glu- <dig>  arg- <dig>  arg- <dig>  arg- <dig>  leu- <dig>  pro- <dig>  lys- <dig>  asp- <dig>  leu- <dig>  tyr- <dig> and leu- <dig> were found to be conserved in approximately 75% of tfs.fig.  <dig> characterization and distribution of bhlh domains. a sequence logo of the bhlh domain generated in meme. amino acids important for dimerization of the helix-loop-helix domain are indicated by stars. b distribution of amino acids in the bhlh consensus motif of wheat bhlh transcription factors. the numbers at the bottom are positions of the residues in the alignment




using the criteria of massari and murre  , the  <dig> bhlh proteins were separated into four categories according to sequence profiles in their basic regions:  <dig> e/g-box binding,  <dig> e-box binding,  <dig> other binding and  <dig> non-binding bhlhs. according to the number of amino acid residues in the basic region, wheat bhlh tfs were separated into two major groups, namely, groups with  or without  dna-binding regions. among the  <dig> tfs with dna-binding regions,  <dig> tfs had both g-box and e-box recognition sites,  <dig> tfs had e-box recognition sites only,  <dig> tfs had other binding sites and  <dig> tfs had no binding sites.

phylogenetic analysis of wheat bhlh tfs
to assess the evolutionary relationships of bhlh tfs in plants, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was generated using conserved bhlh domains from wheat, arabidopsis and rice . twenty-six subfamilies were identified, consistent with results previously obtained from arabidopsis and rice. to label these wheat subfamilies, we therefore adopted the arabidopsis bhlh group nomenclature proposed by pires and dolan . the  <dig> wheat bhlh tfs were grouped into  <dig> of the  <dig> subfamilies , with subfamilies xiii, xiv and x the only ones lacking bhlh tfs from wheat. the meme program was used to identify conserved motifs of tfs in each bhlh subfamily. fifteen conserved motifs were identified and designated as motifs  <dig> through  <dig> . most bhlh tfs in the same subfamily clearly had similar motifs .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of bhlh transcription factor domains in wheat, arabidopsis and rice. the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using clustalx <dig> and mega <dig> software. bootstrapping with  <dig> replicates was used to assess the statistical reliability of nodes in the tree

chromosomal distribution and synteny analysis
because the wheat genome has not yet been fully sequenced, only  <dig> of the  <dig> wheat bhlh genes were successfully mapped to the wheat survey sequence ; others were mapped onto the wheat scaffolds . the largest number of these bhlh tfs were distributed on wheat chromosome 3b, while chromosomes 1a and 1d contained the least .

a total of  <dig> wheat bhlh genes had orthologs in arabidopsis , rice  and both of them  . for example, wbhlh <dig> on chromosome 1b, is orthologous to genes on arabidopsis  chromosome  <dig> and rice  chromosome 5; wbhlh <dig> on chromosome 2d, is orthologous to genes on arabidopsis  chromosome  <dig> and rice  chromosome 3; and wbhlh <dig> on chromosome 1b, is orthologous only to genes on arabidopsis  chromosome  <dig> .

gene ontology and enrichment analysis
functional annotation of the  <dig> bhlh tfs revealed their association with a range of cellular component, molecular function and biological process categories . the majority of functions were biological processes, such as cellular process , metabolic process , biological regulation , response to stimulus , developmental process , pigmentation , multicellular organismal process , response to stress , hormone metabolic process , dormancy process  and seed germination  . the most highly enriched molecular function categories were related to binding , catalysis , hydrolase , nucleoside binding , nucleotide binding , ion binding , transferase  and protein binding  . most bhlh genes assigned to the binding category were involved in binding to dna, proteins and ions. the cellular component category included terms related to cell , cell part , envelope , intracellular , intracellular organelle , intracellular part  and membrane  .fig.  <dig> gene ontology analysis of bhlh genes. the results are classified into three main categories: cellular component, molecular function and biological process. the y-axis indicates the percentage of genes in a given category, while numbers above bars represent the number of genes in that category




on the basis of these annotations, only  <dig> bhlh tfs from  <dig> orthologous wbhlh proteins of arabidopsis and rice could be annotated in eight protein–protein interaction networks and identified in the string database . two kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways involving bhlh proteins were also detected, with proteins wbhlh <dig>  and wbhlh <dig>  involved in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway  and wbhlh <dig>  regulating light signal transduction in the circadian rhythm pathway . the same kegg pathways were also obtained when we annotated wbhlh tf proteins in sorghum and maize .

differential expression of bhlh genes in various tissues
the expression patterns of  <dig> wheat bhlh tfs were characterized at different growth stages in different tissues and organs using the  <dig> rna-seq data files . seven obvious blocks  of bhlh tfs with significant altered expression levels in endosperm, aleurone, seedlings, heading-stage spikes, flag leaves, shoots and roots were detected. blocks a–d and f, but not blocks e and g, showed obvious tissue-specific expression . the bhlh genes contained in blocks a and b were mainly expressed in spikes at the heading stage and in anthers at the uninucleate pollen stage. most bhlh genes in block c displayed higher expression levels in shoots than in leaves . the bhlh genes in block d were mainly expressed in 1-week-old roots and leaves. we found that the bhlh genes in block e exhibited higher expression levels in aleurone, heading-stage spikes, fusarium graminearum inoculated spikelets and non-inoculated spikelets, and 1-week-old leaves. the bhlh genes in block f also showed high expression levels in 1-week-old leaves. although bhlh genes in block g showed nonspecific expression in endosperm, aleurone, inner pericarps, outer pericarps, transfer cells, caryopses, and heading-stage spikes, all of these tissues are associated with seed.fig.  <dig> heat map of expression levels of wheat bhlh transcription factor family genes at different growth periods in different tissues and organs. the lines link gene structures and expression levels. each subfamily is represented by a different color. a grouping of  <dig> bhlh genes into  <dig> subfamilies according to gene structure. b clustering of bhlh gene expression patterns into  <dig> subgroups . seven blocks  correspond to higher expression levels. c enlarged map section showing details of bhlh gene expression of block g as an example. d these expression profile data were obtained using qpcr. the ‘scale’ function in r was used to normalize relative expression values. the heat map was generated using the pheatmap package of r. fpkm values were normalized using the ‘scale’ function in r




as an example, the enlarged area of the heat map in fig. 5c shows the high expression of bhlh genes in subgroup sg <dig> . expression levels of the selected  <dig> bhlh tfs gradually increased in leaves under salt stress from  <dig> to 48 h, whereas no significant variance in expression was detected among non-salt-stressed samples from leaves, roots, seedlings, endosperm, aleurone, spikelets and heading-stage flag leaves. genes from the same subfamily had obviously similar expression patterns. for example, bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig> and bhlh <dig> of subfamily iva  exhibited similar expression patterns in all samples, as did bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig> and bhlh <dig> of subfamily ib . however, some other genes of the same subfamily, such as bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig> and bhlh <dig> of subfamily ib, displayed contrasting expression patterns . moreover, some genes from different subfamilies showed similar expression patterns, such as bhlh <dig> , bhlh <dig>  and bhlh <dig> .

considering our results from another perspective, we present the xii subfamily as an example. this subfamily exhibited three main expression patterns corresponding to different subgroups on the heat map. first, the five bhlh tfs  in sg <dig> all had the same expression pattern . second, the expression patterns of nine bhlh tfs  in sg <dig> were also identical to one another . finally, wbhlh <dig>  wbhlh <dig>  wbhlh <dig> and wbhlh <dig> in sg <dig> all had different expression patterns .

we obtained expression data by combining genechip and expression profiling data from plexdb. block b contained two subgroups ; block c did likewise  . the bhlh genes of sg <dig> and sg <dig>  except for wbhlh <dig>  displayed relatively high expression levels in anthers before anthesis . most genes of sg <dig> and sg <dig> also showed relatively high expression levels in leaves at this stage . we compared the expression profiles of bhlh tfs in block g  by rna-seq and qpcr. the expression levels of these endosperm-specifically tfs were well correlated between the two methods  .

discussion
characteristics of bhlh family genes in wheat
in this study, we systematically predicted and identified  <dig> bhlh tf members in the wheat genome. based on the characterization of bhlh tfs according to expressed sequence tag data , we used rna-seq data to predict bhlh tfs that resulted in  <dig> bhlh tfs newly identified and localized on wheat genome survey sequences . this success can be attributed to the fact that rna-seq achieves single-nucleotide resolution, has a substantially higher dynamic range relative to expressed sequence tag sequencing, and allows reliable identification of rare transcripts and alternative splicing .

the bhlh proteins were separated into four categories based on sequence profiles of their basic regions. consistent with previous studies , most of these proteins contained  <dig> conserved amino acid sites . leu- <dig> in the bhlh hlix <dig> region is the most conserved amino acid residue in plants, including in arabidopsis, chinese cabbage, tomato and rice  <cit> . this residue, which may be extremely important for promoting the formation of dimerization among bhlh proteins, is less conserved in dicots than monocots. interestingly, we found that leu- <dig> was mutated to ile- <dig> in only five wheat bhlh proteins  and has been lost in wbhlh <dig> .

the genome of hexaploid wheat contains  <dig>  mb of dna originating from the natural hybridization of three genomes: a, b and d  <cit> . on the basis of the characteristics of bhlh conserved regions , we attempted to locate homologs of putative bhlh genes in the wheat genome database  and tgac . among the  <dig> identified wbhlh tfs, homologs of  <dig> appeared to be absent from either a, b or d genomes, while  <dig> were not located on two genomes . two possible reasons for their absence are gene loss during evolution  <cit>  and the parameters used for bioinformatics analyses.

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> distinct protein sequences clearly divided the bhlh genes into  <dig> subfamilies. this classification was further supported by the results of gene structure and motif analyses . the topology of our phylogenetic tree, constructed from bhlh genes of three species , is generally consistent with a previously published tree derived from arabidopsis and rice. in earlier studies, the number of bhlh tf family members has varied among species, with  <dig> bhlh tfs identified in arabidopsis and  <dig> in soybean,  <dig> in maize,  <dig> in rice,  <dig> in chinese cabbage and  <dig> in potato  <cit> . this abundance indicates that the bhlh tf family has an essential role in growth and development of wheat and other plants.

potential roles of bhlh genes in wheat
bhlh genes have been extensively studied and found to be involved in a wide variety of plant processes. for instance, bhlh tfs are involved in stress response, plant development, metabolite biosynthesis and trait development. specific examples include response to cold  and heat , abscisic acid and jasmonic acid responses as well as light-signaling pathways , root hair formation , anther development  and axillary meristem generation   <cit> . the functional annotation of wheat bhlh genes in this study revealed their responsiveness to abiotic stress and hormone signal transduction . our protein–protein interaction network contained  <dig> wbhlh proteins with significant homology to arabidopsis that had associations with abiotic stress and endogenous hormone signal transduction. for example, wbhlh <dig>  expression is transcriptionally induced by light and cold in imbibed seeds  <cit> , wbhlh <dig>  is implicated in light-signal transduction  <cit>  and pil <dig> is a phytochrome-interacting bhlh tf that negative regulates seed germination  <cit>  . wheat tf proteins wbhlh <dig> and wbhlh <dig>  which are respectively close orthologs of arabidopsis myc <dig> and pif <dig>  were found to be involved in two kegg pathways in arabidopsis but not in rice. wbhlh <dig>  is able to improve tolerance to phosphorus and nitrogen deprivation via regulation of nutrient transporter gene transcription and reactive oxygen species homeostasis  <cit> . wbhlh <dig>  has been demonstrated to enhance the susceptibility of transgenic arabidopsis to pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . wbhlh <dig>  regulates anthocyanin synthesis in wheat pericarps  <cit> . wbhlh <dig>  enhances freezing tolerance, while wbhlh <dig>  has been found to be affected by salt stress in a tolerant wheat cultivar  <cit> .

expression patterns of bhlh genes imply cooperative action and functional differentiation
bhlh tf genes from the same subfamily had similar expression patterns, with some genes belonging to different subfamilies showing similar expression patterns . we also observed some anomalous gene expression patterns associated with sg <dig>  sg <dig>  sg <dig> and sg <dig> , possibly the result of sample differences, blast tool mismatching or experimental errors. in this study, the bhlh genes of sg <dig> and sg <dig> had their highest expression levels in shoot and leaves . although plexdb did not contain expression data from shoots, most bhlh genes of sg <dig> and sg <dig> showed their highest expressions in leaves at the seedling stage. according to the bhlh gene expression data , we selected six bhlh genes and assayed their expression by qpcr. most of these genes displayed expression patterns identical to those revealed from bioinformatics analysis of anthesis-period seeds. these results indicate that bhlh tfs with similar structures may have similar functions. bhlh tfs in different subfamilies that have identical expression patterns may participate in the same network to cooperatively regulate plant processes.

CONCLUSIONS
since the importance for development and stress tolerance,  <dig> bhlh tfs predicted from wheat were subjected to identification, classification, phylogenetic reconstruction, conserved motif characterization, chromosomal distribution determination and expression pattern analysis. the bhlh proteins could be separated into four categories based on sequences in their basic regions. neighbor-joining-based phylogenetic analysis of conserved bhlh domains from wheat, arabidopsis and rice identified  <dig> subfamilies of bhlh tfs, of which  <dig> were found in wheat. a total of  <dig> wheat bhlh genes had orthologs in arabidopsis , rice  and both of them . seven tissue-specific bhlh tf clusters were identified according to their expression patterns in endosperm, aleurone, seedlings, heading-stage spikes, flag leaves, shoots and roots. expression levels of six endosperm-specifically expressed tfs measured by qpcr and rna-seq showed a good correlation. this comprehensive and systematic analysis of bhlh transcription factors in wheat reveals that those tfs from the same subfamily with similar sequence motifs generally have similar expression patterns. the findings in this work provided useful information for functional analysis of bhlh that could be used for improving of agronomic and economic benefit in wheat.
