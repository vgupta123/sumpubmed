BACKGROUND
vertebrates can distinguish numerous odorants in the environment using chemosensory receptors that are expressed in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . four types of chemosensory receptors have been found in the vertebrate olfactory epithelium, including the main odorant receptors   <cit> , vomeronasal receptors   <cit> , trace-amine associated receptors   <cit>  and formyl peptide receptor-like proteins  <cit> . the or genes were initially identified in mouse olfactory organ by linda buck and richard axel  <cit> , who found that each olfactory sensory neuron expressed a single or allele  <cit> . the ors, located on the surface of dendrites of sensory neurons on the olfactory epithelia, are the most important chemosensory receptors in the detection and perception of common odorants in the environment. two types of vrs  that are located in the vomeronasal organ in mammals are mainly responsible for detection of pheromones. in fishes, ors and vrs are both distributed in the one olfactory organ   <cit> . the taars, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, are responsible for recognition of trace amines and related compounds  <cit> . the formyl peptide receptor-like proteins that are found in the vomeronasal organs in mammals have an olfactory function associated with the identification of pathogenic states.

the ors are the most important chemosensory receptors in detecting environmental chemicals in daily life, and they detect a wide range of compounds. a large number of or genes have now been isolated from various species. approximately  <dig>  putative functional or genes and ~ <dig> pseudogenes in mouse  <cit> , ~ <dig> putative functional or genes and ~ <dig> pseudogenes in human  <cit>  and ~ <dig> or genes in fishes  <cit>  have been identified from genome databases. the vertebrate or genes have recently been divided into two major types, type  <dig> and type  <dig>  the type  <dig> genes were subdivided into five groups, α, β, γ, δ, ε and ζ, and the type  <dig> genes into four groups, η, θ, κ and λ, but the groups θ, κ and λ are considered to likely be non-or genes because they were identified from genome databases and found not to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . mammalian or genes are clearly classified into class i and class ii  <cit> ; here, groups α and β correspond to class i and the group γ to class ii  <cit> .

currently, the most fish or genes have been identified from genome databases. however, we do not know whether these genes are really expressed in the fish olfactory epithelia. so far, few experiments have been carried out to validate the expression status of or genes in the fish olfactory epithelium. in addition, it is necessary to expand the knowledge of fish ors, especially for marine fishes, as the teleost fishes from which or genes have been reported so far are mostly not strict marine fishes but freshwater, brackish or amphidromous.

the large yellow croaker , an economically important fish in china, belongs to the family sciaenidae of the order perciformes and dwells on the coast of the temperate zone in china. to clarify the evolution of the l. crocea or genes and to discover whether they are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, we cloned or cdnas from large yellow croaker by rt-pcr on the olfactory organ and isolated full-length cdna using rapid amplification of cdna ends . we then conducted phylogenetic analysis using these or genes and others from  <dig> vertebrate species and determined the expression levels of the different subfamilies in wild-type fishes using quantitative real-time pcr.

RESULTS
the number of or genes in l. crocea
cdnas corresponding to  <dig> or genes were isolated from the olfactory epithelium, including  <dig> full-length and  <dig> partial cdnas. figure  <dig> shows the number of or genes belonging to each subgroup. a disruption was found in two sequences in comparison with the complete cdna sequence obtained at the same time from l. crocea olfactory epithelium. one sequence had lost a start codon and another had lost a few nucleotides in the region of the 5' primer, but the open reading frame of the both sequences was not shifted .

in teleost fishes, the numbers of or genes are highly variable. table  <dig> shows the numbers of functional or genes from six fishes  <cit> . the zebrafish has the largest number of functional or genes , and the pufferfish has the least . however, an accurate number of or genes in different fishes remains unknown, because some of the sequences in the genome database of distinct species may be either intact or not completely included because of the limitation of sequencing technology. l. crocea contains about  <dig> or genes that are expressed in the olfactory epithelium.

a functional gene is a sequence that does not contain nonsense or frame shift mutation or long deletions and has initiation and stop codons at the proper positions. all the large yellow croaker or genes are inferred from cdna amplified from mrna in the olfactory epithelium. therefore, they are considered as functional genes whether full-length or partial cdna.

phylogenetic analysis
a species tree was built using mitochondrial genomes to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among  <dig> species, including  <dig> fishes and  <dig> amphibian . the species tree was in an excellent agreement with a previous study  <cit> . amphioxus  <cit> , which diverged from the vertebrates perhaps  <dig> million years ago , was used to root the tree. figure  <dig> clearly shows the evolutionary processes among the  <dig> species. the large yellow croaker is more closely related to fugu, pufferfish and stickleback than it is to medaka, salmon, trout, zebrafish and goldfish.

an or gene tree was constructed using the relevant or genes from large yellow croaker and  <dig> other species . two representative or genes from amphioxus that are highly divergent from vertebrate or genes were used to root the tree  <cit> . the phylogeny shows the relationships between the species, with branch lengths proportional to the number of expected substitutions per amino acid site. from this analysis and the criteria set forth by previous studies  <cit> , the or genes from these species could be classified into two major groups, the type  <dig> and type  <dig> genes . the type  <dig> genes are subdivided into four groups, β, δ, ε and ζ, and the group δ is further split into two subgroups . groups α and γ of type  <dig>  which are present in amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals and absent in fish except for one intact gene in zebrafish and a few pseudogenes in medaka and stickleback, were not included in the phylogenetic analysis. type  <dig> only contains group η in this study. thus, five groups  were included in the phylogenetic tree. five clades  of l. crocea or genes were assigned to group δ , three clades  were assigned to group η, and clade e was assigned in the group β.

to further analyze the evolutionary processes and infer the or gene duplications and losses among these different fishes, a reconciled tree was constructed using notung  <dig>   <cit>  based on the above gene and species trees . the tree shows  <dig> duplications and  <dig> losses. some lost or genes from unknown species were inferred, and these species were not included in this study owing to the limitations of the current or gene database.

from the above phylogenetic analysis, we can see that the l. crocea or genes are more closely related to those of fugu, pufferfish and stickleback than they are to medaka, zebrafish and frog . the evolutionary pattern of the or genes thus corresponds to the phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genome sequences. each subfamily of or genes evolved from common ancestral genes and was expanded in extant species. many genes have duplicated, and many have been lost.

functional divergence among fish or genes
gu  <cit>  has developed a statistical method to test the significance of type i and type ii functional divergence between duplicate genes. type i divergence results in site-specific rate shifts after gene duplication, and type ii divergence results in site-specific property  shifts. we used the software diverge  <dig> , which uses this method  <cit> , to analyze the inferred or protein sequences, and to infer the functional divergence of or proteins and to predict the amino acid site changes involved in functional divergence among sequences. the results indicate that the functional divergence among subgroups of odorant receptors is of type i . the coefficient of type i functional divergence between duplicate genes, denoted θml, is defined as the probability of functional divergence. a large value of θml indicates a high level of type i functional divergence, and vice versa. figure  <dig> shows posterior probabilities of functional variation of amino acid residues. the variation sites with posterior probability larger than  <dig>  are highlighted in the three-dimensional structure of an odorant receptor shown.

the statistical results represent functional divergence among different clades in each group. θml represents the coefficient of type i functional divergence; se θml is the standard deviation of θml.

the analysis of group δ <dig> ors suggests that the level of functional divergence between clades c and d  is higher than that between clades c and a , and the functional divergence between clades a and d is the lowest in the pairwise comparisons . the value of θml between clades f and g in δ <dig> is  <dig> , which means that these two groups of genes have evolved different functions. only one clade of or genes was found in the group β, and it was clustered with the group ζ and ε in the phylogenetic analysis . the level of functional divergence between groups β and ζ  is higher than that between groups β and ε , but the functional divergence between groups ζ and ε is the highest  among these three groups.

the type  <dig> genes are more diverse than type  <dig>  three clades of or genes in group η were included in this study. these clades were analyzed in pairwise comparison to predict the functional divergence. the results showed that the θml values generated by pairwise comparison among the three clades were  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   . this suggests that all three clades have experienced functional divergence and have evolved different functions from their ancestors.

however, the sequences in the same clade were found to be highly conserved. the or genes from different species in the same clade may perform similar functions, for example, detecting similar chemicals.

expression levels of or genes in the l. crocea olfactory epithelium
sixteen pairs of primers were designed according to the sequences in each clade  to detect the expression levels of or genes using quantitative real-time pcr. to evaluate whether each pair of primers conform to the efficiencies within the range  <dig> - <dig> , their efficiencies were examined by establishing standard curves based on regression analyses of the ct  value versus the log value of 10-times dilution of each target gene  for each pair of primers . the primers that had efficiencies within the range  <dig> - <dig>  were used in quantitative real-time pcr.

the average ct values of each gene expression obtained by real-time pcr are shown in additional file  <dig>  the mrna copies were calculated according to the ct values and the standard curves. expression of each target gene was normalized to the housekeeping control gene β-actin. the results showed that the different clades of or genes have distinct expression levels . comparisons between groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance . the or genes in clade k  in group η were expressed at the highest levels of all groups , followed by the clade c <dig>  c <dig> and g <dig> within group δ, and then clade i <dig> and i <dig> within group η in decreasing order, but no significant differences were found between each other. the expression levels of genes in clades a <dig>  c <dig>  d, f, g <dig> and g <dig> were similar , but they were significantly lower than those of the above clades . the expression levels of or genes in clade a <dig> is twice as high as that in clade a <dig> . the or genes in clade e within group β were expressed at the lowest level among all groups . these results suggest that the or genes in the clade k are expressed at the highest level in the olfactory epithelium, and or genes in clade e were expressed at the lowest level.

discussion
variable numbers of fish or genes
the numbers of or genes in teleost fishes are highly variable: zebrafish has the largest number of functional or genes of all the fishes, the large yellow croaker and stickleback have ~ <dig> or genes, fugu has ~ <dig> and the pufferfish has ~ <dig>  from these data, we can see the numbers of or genes vary 2- to 10-fold among these teleost fishes. the numbers of tetrapod or genes are much higher; for example, ~ <dig> functional or genes were identified from the genome in mouse, ~ <dig> in frog and ~ <dig> in human. most mammalian or genes in group α and group γ are thought to be airborne substance receptors  <cit> . the conservation of or genes in mammals is higher than that in fishes  <cit> , and it may be that the mammals evolved more or genes to adapt to the environment on the land  <cit> .

the evolutionary pattern of fish or genes
or genes originated at a very early time in chordate evolution, before appearance of amphioxus, which diverged from its most recent common ancestor with vertebrates  <dig> mya  <cit> . the vertebrate or genes have evolved into different families and subfamilies from their ancestor. the type  <dig> and type  <dig> genes diverged before the divergence of jawless and jawed vertebrates. the seven groups  diverged at around the separation of the jawless and jawed fishes. the tetrapods evolved groups α and γ, which were absent in fishes, but they lost most of fish-like groups  except in amphibians  <cit> . we have clarified the evolutionary relationship of or genes among modern teleost fishes using phylogenetic analysis. the results are consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the or genes of extant teleost fish evolved from the common ancestor of actinopterygii   <cit> . the or gene relationships among extant teleost fishes fit with their evolutionary history of the fishes. the large yellow croaker, fugu, pufferfish and stickleback are close evolutionary relatives, and thus their or genes are more closely related to each other than to those of other fishes in this study. modern teleosts have inherited the or genes and gradually expanded genes from their common ancestors in the process of speciation and duplication. however, in the process of gene duplication, some genes were lost, as shown in the reconciled tree . some or genes have developed species-specific functions  <cit> , but others have been lost and pseudogenized. for example, about 10-55% of or genes in zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, fugu and pufferfish have become pseudogenes  <cit> . half the human or genes have become pseudogenes and lost their function  <cit> .

in summary, extant teleost fishes inherited or genes from their common ancestors during speciation and duplication. some or genes have been lost or pseudogenized during evolution. the fishes with close evolutionary relationships show a closer relationship between their or genes.

functional divergence among or families
functional divergence is the process by which genes, after gene duplication, shift in function from an ancestral function. it is thought that this process of gene duplication and functional divergence is a major originator of molecular novelty and has produced many large protein families that exist today  <cit> . because of this, it is desirable, from sequence analysis, to identify amino acid sites that are responsible for functional diversity. it is important to know the level of functional divergence after gene  duplication, as well as how many amino acid substitutions are involved in functional innovations  <cit> . the or genes have been greatly expanded from their ancestral genes, and have developed into one of the largest multi-gene families in the vertebrates. the results of evolutionary divergence analysis indicate that all subfamilies of or genes have functionally diverged from their most recent common ancestors, and they have evolved new functions, because the coefficient of functional divergence  between each pair of clades is significantly larger than  <dig>  however, whether or not the different clades of or genes have different functions needs to be verified by future experiments. site-specific divergence can occur at some amino acid residues . we suggest that the amino acid sites  that show a posterior probability of a functional shift of over  <dig>  were the key sites involved in functional divergence between each pair of clades.

or gene expression and functions
we have shown that ~ <dig> or genes are expressed in the l. crocea olfactory epithelium. a previous study found that only a small proportion of the mouse or genes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, and the remaining or genes are transcriptionally inactive  <cit> . therefore, we inferred that many l. crocea or genes were not transcriptionally active, and that this is why they were not isolated from the epithelium using rt-pcr and race. for example, we do not find the groups ε and ζ in l. crocea, even though they are present in the other fish or gene families. however, we plan to confirm this inference when genomic sequence information is available. the different clades of or genes are expressed at different levels. the expression levels of or genes in the olfactory epithelium appears to control the likelihood that a cdna will be cloned  <cit> . the higher the expression level of an or gene, the easier it will be to isolate it from the epithelium. we found that two sequences, each with one disruption, are still transcribed in the l. crocea olfactory epithelium and inferred that these two sequences may have lost their functions. in a previous study, zhang and firestein  <cit>  found, from the available expression data for mouse or genes  <cit>  and the national center for biotechnology information  mouse expressed sequence tag  database, that some of the mouse or sequences identified from genome databases with one or two disruptions were still expressed in the olfactory organ. other researchers  <cit>  found that a few pseudogenes were also expressed in the mouse olfactory epithelium.

in previous studies, many researchers have shown expression of teleost or genes in the olfactory organ using in situ hybridization  <cit> . more than  <dig> or genes were found to be expressed in the mouse olfactory epithelium, and some or genes were expressed at significantly higher levels than others  <cit> . similarly, we found in the large yellow croaker that different or genes have different expression levels; for example, clades k , c <dig>  c <dig> and g <dig> were shown to be expressed at high levels. however, whether these genes have essential olfactory functions in l. crocea life needs to be further verified. the previous report showed that the monoallelic or expression was achieved through a mechanism in which or protein functions in olfactory neurons to abrogate expression of other or genes  <cit> . data from a number of previous studies also showed that different or genes, or even copies of the same or transgene in different genomic locations, are expressed in different numbers of cells  <cit> , but these studies did not address the issue of transcript levels per cell. the fact that some or genes are frequently chosen to be expressed, and when chosen are expressed at high levels per cell, is intriguing given each olfactory neuron's single-allele expression regime  <cit> . the transcription level of or genes is associated with control regions in the genome locus. mcintyre et al.  <cit>  found that homeobox transcript factors such as emx <dig> stimulated the expression levels of or genes in mouse, but it was not certain whether the rule would also apply to fishes. the regulation of or gene expression is intriguing, and it will be important to clarify the mechanism of gene expression regulation. whether or gene expression is correlated with the location of the genes in the genome and what the regulatory mechanism of or gene expression is in the fish olfactory system are questions awaiting further study. however, it is most important that the expression of or genes in fish must maintain the basic abilities to survive in the environment.

the olfactory system uses a combinatorial receptor coding scheme to encode odor identities  <cit> . each family of or genes is mainly responsible for detecting one class of similar chemicals. many studies of or genes in human and mouse have revealed that one or can be activated by various chemicals, and or genes in the same subfamily might distinguish a similar class of substance or a structural feature in substances  <cit> . fish live in the water and frequently encounter water-soluble substances, and most ors detect water-soluble substances  <cit> . however, the specificity between receptors and ligands has not been extensively reported in fish. the question of whether or not each subfamily of receptors is mainly responsible for detecting a specific array of chemicals in fish awaits an answer.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that about  <dig> or genes are expressed in olfactory epithelium of large yellow croaker. the evolutionary relationships among teleost fish ors accords with the evolutionary history of the fishes themselves. the or genes of modern fishes duplicated from their common ancestor and have been expanded during evolution. the l. crocea or genes are more closely related to those of stickleback, fugu and pufferfish than they are to those of medaka, zebrafish and western clawed frog. the different expression levels of the or genes of the large yellow croaker suggest different roles in olfactory function.
