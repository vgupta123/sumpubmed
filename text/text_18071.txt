BACKGROUND
plants are constantly exposed to many kinds of abiotic stresses  <cit> . water deficiency is one of the main environmental stresses which limits plant growth, distribution and crop yield worldwide  <cit> . it is estimated that, by the end of the 21st century, the droughty terrestrial areas will redouble  <cit> . therefore, it is extremely urgent to determine the mechanisms by which plants respond to drought, to improve the tolerance of drought stress.

to deal with water-deficit stress, plants have developed many mechanisms to regulate the balance of cells. plants optimize their morphology, physiology and metabolism to survive drought stress at both the cellular and organ level  <cit> . previous studies have noted that drought stress can induce oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, the glycolate oxidase pathway, which produces h2o <dig>  is activated by drought  <cit> . also, hydroxyl radicals can form from superoxide radicals and h2o <dig> which can damage dna, lipids and proteins  <cit> . the accumulation of reactive oxygen species  is frequently caused in cells by drought  <cit> . an excess of ros production can lead to oxidative stress in plants and negatively impact the normal function of cells  <cit> . ros scavenging ability and subsequent injury-reducing effects may correlate with the tolerance to drought  <cit> . both enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems have evolved in plants for scavenging and detoxifying ros. the main non-enzymatic antioxidants in plants are soluble ascorbate and glutathione  <cit> . ros scavenging enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase , superoxide dismutase , catalase  and peroxidase  also play a very important role. in enzymatic systems, apx, cat and pod decompose h2o <dig> to h2o at different cellular locations  <cit> . sod converts o2− to h2o <dig>  <cit> . the balance between antioxidative enzyme activities and ros production determines the extent of oxidative signaling and/or damage  <cit> . in addition, as chaperones, the production of hsps confer plants resistance to stress, can be induced by almost all stresses  <cit> . moreover, proline  plays a very important protective role during drought too. together with the increase in other osmolytes concentration and proline accumulates will resulted in the decrease of osmotic potential  <cit> . when plants are under drought stress, this osmotic regulation mechanism makes sure the adaptation to environment  <cit> . proline also takes part in the detoxification of ros  <cit> .

although there are some researches in woody plants responses to drought in morphological and physiological  <cit> , studies in molecular level is few. it is possible to perform reproducible, quantitative and large-scale research on the effect of every type of stress factor on proteome due to the recent advances in proteomics. currently, although proteomics has been studied in varieties of plants , the published proteomic researches on responses to drought followed by recovery is poor  <cit> .

in the atmosphere-plant-soil continuum, the largest hydraulic resistance to water flow is constituted by plant roots. in addition, roots can supply water and nutrients for shoots  <cit> . the main water-absorbing organs in plants are roots, and roots play a crucial role in the development of different plant organs because of the direct contact with drying soil  <cit> , and roots are the plant organ most seriously affected by drought. thus, a variety of stress defense mechanisms against water deficiency have developed in the root system. previous researches have demonstrated that drought can induce the stress defense mechanisms in roots, and also the structural adaptation of root architecture too . plants maintain the water uptake through the high hydraulic conductivity, increased rooting depth and root density and osmotic adjustment of the roots  <cit> . some studies showed that drought stimulates root growth  <cit> , especially in the deeper soil layers  <cit> . this mechanism may play an important role in drought resistance  <cit> . in contrast, some studies found that drought result in restrictions in root growth  <cit> . however, because of the complexity of phenomena encompassing multiple biochemical and physiological processes at both a cellular and organ level, mechanisms of the biochemical and molecular on drought resistance in plant roots has remained limited so far.


amygdalus mira  yü et lu is an important wild peach, and it is considered an ideal wild peach germplasm for improving cultivated peach plants. because of the loss of genetic variation, cultivated peach are sensitive to biotic and abiotic stresses. the wild peach germplasm can offer many useful genes for peach improvement. our earlier studies have shown that amygdalus mira  yü et lu in tibet showed tolerance to drought  <cit> . in addition, the levels of enzyme activities involved in defense mechanisms markedly increased during drought  <cit> . however, there is few knowledge available regarding the molecular response mechanisms related to the tolerance of drought in amygdalus mira yü et lu. proteomics approaches are very useful to characterize the responses of plants exposed to water deficiency. accordingly, we used physiological and proteomic techniques to examine the response of amygdalus mira  yü et lu to drought conditions. in addition, we also analyzed the capacity of amygdalus mira  yü et lu to recover following drought. these results will be useful for understanding the mechanisms of drought tolerance in amygdalus mira  yü et lu and will provide an effective pathway for the exploration of tolerance mechanisms that might improve drought tolerance in peach.

identification of differentially expressed proteins in response to drought stress and recovery
based on the biochemical, physiological and morphological responses to drought stress and recovery, we chose two time points, 16 days, which was the longest drought duration, and 20 days, which was during the recovery period after rewatering, to profile the changes of drought-responsive and recovery-responsive proteome. in total,  <dig> significantly differently expressed proteins were revealed in the drought stress groups compared to control groups . on day  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> identified proteins  were up-regulated while the rest were down-regulated in drought-stressed plants  relative to their control group . after rewatering, in the drought-stressed plants compared with the control group, we found  <dig> down-regulated proteins ,  <dig> up-regulated proteins  and  <dig> proteins  that were not significantly differently expressed in the s <dig> group. comparing the expression of these proteins on day  <dig> and day  <dig>   <dig> proteins  were up-regulated in the s <dig> group and down-regulated in the s <dig> plants,  <dig> proteins  were down-regulated in s <dig> and up-regulated in s <dig>   <dig> proteins  were up-regulated in both s <dig> and s <dig>   <dig> proteins  were down-regulated in both s <dig> and s <dig>   <dig> proteins  were up-regulated in s <dig> but not significantly differentially expressed in s <dig> and  <dig> proteins  were down-regulated in s <dig> but not significantly differentially expressed in s <dig> 

we also assessed how protein level changes during water deficiency and recovery differed at the five time points. as stress progressed and through recovery period, from the day  <dig> to day  <dig>  there were differences  between control groups and stress groups in protein levels . in addition, we followed up our analysis of  in the process of drought and recovery by using κ-means clustering .fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> differentially expressed proteins




because the genome and proteome of amygdalus mira  yü et lu have not been widely characterized, and the number of protein entries in public databases is quite low, it can be tolerated that use the primer sequence and protein entries for similar oligonucleotide primers and proteins expressed in rosaceae family species such as prunus persica, which is bound up with amygdalus mira  yü et lu, provided that a reasonable abundant sequence homology by amino acid replace or deletion  <cit> . in our study, we analyzed  <dig> proteins by ms analysis. the best matched protein with the highest score was selected as the final result for every protein spot . the identified proteins refer to a extensive range of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components including cytoskeleton dynamics , carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism , energy metabolism , transcription and translation , transport , inducer , stress and defense , molecular chaperones , protein degradation , signal transduction , other materials metabolism  and unknown function  .fig.  <dig> functional category distribution of the  <dig> identified proteins

proteins related to stress and defense
large numbers of stress and defense-related proteins were found to be induced in the drought-stressed roots , including five ros metabolism-related proteins . sod  and pod  were both down-regulated by water deficiency and recovered after rewatering. however, apx  responded differently. apx was up-regulated by drought stress and recovered by rewatering. cat expression exhibited a trend similar to the proteins related to inducer. two different spots  were both cat, and responded differently to drought stress. spot.  <dig> was up-regulated during drought, but spot.  <dig> only exhibited up-regulation at day  <dig>  after which it was down-regulated. both spots returned to control levels after rewatering. twelve of the other twenty stress and defense proteins  were increased and the remaining eight  were decreased by drought stress. after rewatering, there were five proteins  that were up-regulated, eight proteins  that were down-regulated and seven proteins  that returned to normal levels .

discussion
biochemical, physiological and molecular influences on plants are wide-spread during drought stress and can be divided into three aspects: growth control, stress damage control and osmotic homeostasis  <cit> . an integrated proteomics, biochemical, physiological and morphological approach was used for our research to investigate these three aspects of drought stress responses in amygdalus mira  yü et lu.

morphological, physiological and biochemical responses to drought stress and recovery
as the organs in direct contact with soil, roots are seriously affected by drought stress. previous studies displayed that root growth was significantly enhanced at the early stage of drought  <cit> , but in our study, there were no significant changes at the early phase of drought. yoshimura  <cit>  observed that wild watermelon’s root growth suppressed at the later phase of drought, which is consistent with our study. we identified significant suppression of root length at day  <dig>  which yoshimura  <cit>  hypothesized may be relevant to the implementation of drought tolerance mechanisms as roots deal with the reduced soil water potential without obtaining new water resources. after rewatering, at day  <dig>  root growth recovered. meanwhile, root water content gradually decreased with intensified drought stress, which is also consistent with the previous study  <cit> . after rewatering, root water content also recovered.

proline plays a protective role during drought stress  <cit> . nayyar  <cit>  found a higher rate of proline accumulation and utilization during drought in wheat. similar results have also been obtained in alfalfa  <cit> . moreover, decreased membrane injury correlated with a greater ability to accumulate proline has been found in barley  <cit> . in the current study, drought stress induced a 30-fold increase in proline levels at day  <dig>  good  <cit>  suggested that proline level increases may be primarily the result of increased synthesis. after rewatering, proline levels decreased and showed no significant difference compared to the control group. mda is a product of lipid peroxidation, and the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation can be reflected by mda levels  <cit> . as a ros, h2o <dig> can damage membrane lipids, proteins and dna  <cit> . in other words, the levels of mda and h2o <dig> can play a role of indicators of the free radical reactions occurring in the stressed tissue  <cit> . additionally, the relative conductivity  is another indicator of membrane damage  <cit> . previous studies reported that the levels of mda  <cit> , h2o <dig>  <cit>  and rec  <cit>  significantly increased in response to drought. as expected, levels of all three indicators increased significantly during drought in our research. in particular, the levels of mda and h2o <dig> were significantly increased after 8 days of drought, while the rec level exhibited significant changes after 12 days of drought. all these changes indicated that drought stress led to membrane damage. after rewatering, the level of rec returned to normal, the level of mda significantly decreased but was still higher than that of the controls, and the level of h2o <dig> did not recover. from these results, we can conclude that the membrane damage of membrane was being repaired but that the repair process was not complete. the signaling in plants or potential of oxidative stress may be indicated by the level of ros during drought and recovery  <cit> . sofo  <cit>  and upadhyaya  <cit>  found lower ros levels in prunus hybrids and tea, respectively. in contrast, bian  <cit>  found that the accumulation of ros still appeared and rwc had fully recovered, which is consistent with our result. it may because that it did not necessarily limit production of ros during the recovery period in amygdalus mira  yü et lu roots, suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in root recovery from drought. the role of ros in drought and subsequent recovery of amygdalus mira  yü et lu roots remains unclear and requires further investigation.

the increased ros products induced changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. antioxidant enzymes can maintain the balance of the formation and elimination of ros by detoxification of excess ros  <cit> . cat is present in peroxisomes, but it is essential for resolving h2o <dig> during stress  <cit> . apx is an antioxidant enzyme in the ascorbate-glutathione  cycle, which is an efficient antioxidant system for the detoxification of h2o <dig>  <cit> . the asa-gsh cycle properly scavenges ros in plant cells by maintaining a ratio of a reduced per oxidized ascorbic acid and glutathione  <cit> . several previous studies found that apx activity was increased  <cit> , cat activity was reduced  <cit>  or increased  <cit>  and pod activity was increased  <cit>  during drought stress, and upon rewatering, pod activity significantly declined but was still higher than that of the control, while apx activity was down-regulated. these different responses may depend on intensity of ros production, stress severity and plant species  <cit> . in the present research, the activities of apx, cat and pod were all up-regulated during drought stress. this result suggested that amygdalus mira  yü et lu up-regulates the activities of these antioxidant enzymes to protect against ros toxicity. after rewatering, the activities of pod and apx significantly declined but were still significantly higher than those of the control, and the activity of cat did not show a significant change. this result has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . it has been indicated that although there have different affinities for h2o <dig> in pod, apx and cat, they can all efficiently facilitate h2o <dig> scavenging in amygdalus mira  yü et lu root cells. in addition, a co-regulated antioxidant mechanism could develop to vary with roots in amygdalus mira  yü et lu.

actin  is a typical cytoskeleton-related protein, and profilin  plays an important role in the regulation of actin polymerization  <cit> . liu  <cit>  found that the down-regulation of profilin lead to the number of filamentous actin decreased and induced actin disorganization. previous studies reported that profilin significantly accelerates formin-mediated barbed end actin elongation  <cit> . in our research, the expression of these proteins was down-regulated in response to drought and returned to normal levels after rewatering compared to the controls. this result is consistent with the morphological response. from these observations, we can conclude that drought caused down-regulated expression of proteins related to cytoskeleton dynamics, resulting in shriveled and brown amygdalus mira  yü et lu roots.

in previous studies, the levels of carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism-related proteins were increased because of drought stress  <cit> . on the other hand, in other studies, it has been reported that the expression of these proteins decreased in response to drought stress  <cit> . in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis is an important metabolic pathway which can be found in almost all living organisms. the central role of glycolysis is to generate precursors for anabolism and provide energy to plants  <cit> . in our study, the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , which is involved in glycolysis, was decreased by drought and recovered after rewatering. as a typical glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase plays an important role in response to stress and the development of plants  <cit> . it has been reported that the accumulation of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes can be displayed in the early period of drought, particularly in tolerant species, and then reduced when drought is more invasive or the plant species is less tolerant to drought  <cit> . in our study, four proteins  were down-regulated and two proteins  were up-regulated after drought stress, and three of these six proteins  did not recover after rewatering. this result suggested that these proteins act synergistically to protect the plant from drought stress, and this effect could mean a better reaction capacity or higher flexibility for spot.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> compared to spot.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

two identified proteins  are related to atp synthesis, which is applied to carbon assimilation in the light-reactions of ps  <cit> . atp synthase is a key enzyme for atp synthesis during electron transport. with the predominantly on the beta subunit or catalytic sites being carried wholly, the activity and stability of atp synthase regulate the atp synthesis  <cit> . previous studies regarding the expression of atp-related proteins in response to drought stress are contradictory. josé  <cit>  and tezara  <cit>  observed a decrease in the expression of the atp synthase beta subunit during drought stress. they hypothesized that because a smaller amount of energy is needed by the cells during drought in these plants, the atpase content is likely reduced. however, kottapalli  <cit> , and zhou  <cit>  observed the opposite, and these results are consistent with our current study. kottapalli  <cit>  suggested that the atp synthase beta subunit is highly induced only in drought-tolerant genotypes. in our study, the expression of this atp-related protein is up-regulated during drought stress and recovers after rewatering. the higher expression of the atp synthase beta subunit in our study might improve the energy supply to protect amygdalus mira  yü et lu from injury under drought stress conditions. cytochrome p <dig>  is a protein that catalyzes the transformation of teasterone to 3-dehydroteasterone as well as the transformation of 6-deoxoteasterone to 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone late in the brassinosteroid  biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . to protect plants from environmental stresses, br has biological activities that include altering plant metabolism  <cit> . farah  <cit>  found that cytochrome p <dig> was up-regulated during drought, and it is consistent with our study. moreover, hong  <cit>  found that a cytochrome p <dig> loss-of-function mutant in rice shows reduced br biosynthesis and a dwarf phenotype. as a mechanism in plants of drought, changes in br biosynthesis remain to be analyzed.

in the signal transduction network, transcription factors are essential, and they lead from the perception of stress signals to the expression of stress-responsive genes  <cit> . our research found a significant increase in ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1a-like  during drought, and it is consistent with the farah study  <cit> . in addition, the expression level did not recover to normal compared with the control after rewatering. ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1a-like  is involved in a variety of plant reactions to abiotic or biotic stresses, and seo  <cit>  found that over-expression of the ertf gene led to tolerance improvement to drought stress. it has been reported that the levels of some proteins related to transcription and translation are up-regulated by stress to enhance stress resistance during a lot of defense-related proteins are newly produced  <cit> . in our study, ribosomal protein s <dig>  and elongation factor tu family protein  increased under drought stress, with the expression of ribosomal protein s <dig> increasing to almost  <dig> times the control level at day  <dig> of drought treatment. this result suggested that to enhance drought stress resistance, amygdalus mira  yü et lu produced defensive proteins through the up-regulation of these transcription- and translation-related proteins.

it is well known that the enhanced production of ros accompanies drought  <cit> . the first step of enzymatic antioxidant defense response is the conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase   <dig>   <cit> . zhou  <cit>  indicated that a major sod isoform contributing to sustained sod activity is fe sod, but previous studies found that cu-zn sod  primarily responds to drought  <cit> . brossa  <cit>  found that sod was up-regulated during drought; however, in our study, consistent with what zhou  <cit>  found, the expression of sod exhibited a trend toward recovery after rewatering. ascorbate peroxidase  plays a very important role in removing h2o <dig> by utilizing asa to reduce h2o <dig> to h2o. the responses of catalase isozyme  <dig>  to drought are heterogeneous, and it has been shown to remain unchanged, increase or even decrease under drought stress  <cit> . the regulation of cat under drought is complex  <cit> . peroxisomal membrane protein pmp <dig>  is a component of peroxisomes,  which contain antioxidant enzymes. yoshimura  <cit>  found pod was up-regulated both at the early phases and the late phases of drought stress in wild watermelon. in our study, during drought, the expression of apx  was up-regulated, and the expression of peroxisomal membrane protein pmp <dig>  significantly decreased. after rewatering, the expression of apx  was lower than that of the controls while the expression of peroxisomal membrane protein pmp <dig>  returned to the level of the controls. the expression of cat  <dig>  in our study is interesting; spot.  <dig> showed a significant increase, while spot.  <dig> was decreased at the late stage of drought stress, and both were lower than the control levels after rewatering. zhou  <cit>  found a similar result in apx protein expression. this result implied that cat protein in amygdalus mira  yü et lu was distributed in different cell compartments and had different tasks under drought stress  <cit> . in contrast to the activities of pod, apx and cat, changes in the expression levels of these proteins were not the same in response to drought. it revealed that protein levels do not necessarily correlate with protein activities. due to the drought acclimation phases, developmental phases and species research, there are certainly variations in response to drought  <cit> . the induction of ros-related factors suggests that the production of ros is accompanied with drought, and the induction of ros-related enzymes indicates an antioxidant system that may be involved in the protection of amygdalus mira  yü et lu from damage due to drought stress.

molecular chaperones were also identified to be regulated by drought stress. previous studies found that molecular chaperones were up-regulated during drought stress  <cit> . in our study, three types of molecular chaperones  were found to be up-regulated, and the other six identified chaperones  were shown to be down-regulated. only luminal-binding protein  <dig>  recovered after rewatering. among the identified chaperones, hsp <dig>  has been shown to refold non-native proteins which facilitate translocation processes and prevent protein aggregation under stress  <cit> . furthermore, small hsps  have been known to through protecting nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity  to maintaining electron transport in mitochondrial during stress  <cit> . our results suggest the important roles of this family in coping with drought by the regulation of molecular chaperones. in addition, our data indicated that cellular proteins in amygdalus mira  yü et lu roots are potentially exposed to an increasing risk of aggregation and denaturation during gradual drought stress, and the induction of molecular chaperones may have an essential role in offsetting this risk.

the observed expression pattern during drought stress for the proteins involved in protein degradation was also complex. rad <dig> protein  and predicted: putative dna repair protein rad23-3-like  have been known to function in dna excision repair, and both contain a ubiquitin-like domain. as hershko  <cit>  indicated, protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a key role in controlling cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig>  has been reported to increase under stress  <cit> . in our study, we observed significant up-regulation and down-regulation of spot.  <dig> and spot.  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, after rewatering, the expressions of these two proteins were different than the expressions under drought stress. after rewatering, rad <dig> protein  was decreased and predicted: putative dna repair protein rad23-3-like  was increased. it is possible that proteins related to protein degradation are also connection with the biosynthesis of novel proteins contained in the drought resistance mechanisms in amygdalus mira  yü et lu roots.

quantitative real-time pcr analysis
the transcription level of seven genes was different from the protein level, an inconsistency that has been observed in many previous studies  <cit> . the differences may be due to post-translational processing or post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the consistency between protein expression level and transcription level in the other four analyzed genes manifests that these proteins may be initially accommodated at the transcriptional level during root development phase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our research supports further information about proteomic, biochemical, physiological and morphological responses in the roots of amygdalus mira  yü et lu to drought and recovery. at the physiological level, drought stress reduced root water content and root length, and amygdalus mira  yü et lu responded to drought by increasing the levels of proline, mda, h2o <dig> and the relative conductivity. the activity of pod, apx, and cat in roots increased when exposed to drought and did not recover after rewatering. by analyzing proteins in the treatment and control groups over time, we support quantitative evidence regarding how biological processes are regulated during gradual drought and rewatering. moreover, if this is a single time point experiment, such information would be missed. plenty of proteins have been identified to be contained in drought stress. in addition, we also presented a correlation between protein and transcript levels. generally, the interaction between enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, the levels of proline, mda, h2o <dig> and the relative conductivity, and the expression level of proteins in drought-treated plants all contribute to drought resistance in amygdalus mira  yü et lu. however, a more comprehensive analysis is necessary for understanding the variability in the response of amygdalus mira  yü et lu to drought.
