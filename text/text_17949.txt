BACKGROUND
p <dig> is a cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor  that controls cell proliferation, cell motility and apoptosis  <cit> . it regulates the progression of cells from g <dig> to s phase by binding and inhibiting the cyclin e-cdk <dig> complex. a plethora of evidence has implicated downregulation of p <dig> in prevalent human carcinomas  <cit> . for example, downregulation of p <dig> is among the most frequent non-genetic molecular alterations in prostate cancer   <cit> . in this disease, low p <dig> expression is correlated with a number of prognostic morphological features  <cit>  and with decreased survival  <cit> . in contrast, ectopic expression of p <dig> can inhibit cell cycle progression in a human pca cell line  <cit> , suppress astrocytoma growth in nude mice  <cit>  and induce the death of breast cancer cells  <cit> . based on these findings, p <dig> has been denoted as a tumour suppressor.

the regulation of p <dig> during the cell cycle is very complex  <cit> . it involves regulation at the level of transcription, messenger rna translation  <cit>  and protein stability. the distribution among different cyclin-cdk complexes  <cit> , its sub-cellular localization  <cit>  as well as phosphorylation of several residues in p <dig> are important mechanisms of control  <cit> . p <dig> levels are high in quiescent cells and decrease rapidly upon mitogenic stimulation. however, the cell cycle-dependent variations in p <dig> levels are not reflected by similar changes in p <dig> mrna  <cit> . unlike traditional tumour suppressor genes, the p <dig> gene rarely undergoes homozygous inactivation in cancer cells  <cit> , a finding that points towards alternative mechanisms of p <dig> inactivation. many aggressive cancers display decreased p <dig> protein levels in the presence of high p <dig> mrna  <cit> , suggesting that p <dig> depletion is primarily a result of ectopic proteolysis.

the p <dig> protein accumulates in cells when the ubiquitin proteasome system  is inhibited  <cit> . this system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions that covalently attach a ubiquitin chain to a substrate protein  <cit> , leading to the recognition by the proteasome for degradation. biochemical studies identified scfskp <dig>  an ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates phosphorylation-dependent p <dig> ubiquitylation in vitro  <cit> . two other enzymes, kpc and pirh <dig>  have been also been implicated as e3s for p <dig>  <cit> . whereas scfskp <dig> mediates the degradation of nuclear p <dig> throughout s phase and g <dig>  kpc targets cytoplasmic p <dig> upon cell cycle entry from g <dig>  <cit> ; pirh <dig> instead targets nuclear and cytoplasmic p <dig>  <cit> .

considerable evidence suggests, however, that skp <dig> is the prominent regulator of p <dig> levels in cancer cells  <cit> . skp <dig> overexpression is frequent in human carcinomas devoid of p <dig>  <cit> . in addition, our own data have shown that skp <dig> overexpression in lncap prostate cancer cells is sufficient to direct p <dig> ubiquitylation and degradation  <cit> . furthermore, transgenic expression of skp <dig> in the mouse prostate causes low-grade prostate carcinomas that coincide with p <dig> downregulation  <cit> . conversely, rna interference -mediated knockdown of skp <dig> expression inhibits tumour growth in a mouse transplant model  <cit> . these findings validated p <dig> degradation pathways as promising cancer drug targets  <cit> .

the complexity of p <dig> regulation presents considerable challenges to drug development because of the potential for redundancies. thus, it is not readily apparent which enzyme involved in p <dig> regulation should be targeted in order to effect sustained p <dig> accumulation in cancer cells. in addition, pharmacological agents active in an enzyme assay in vitro are not necessarily bioactive in intact cells. rather than targeting a preselected component, we have developed a method for the up-front identification of compounds that are bioactive in restoring physiological levels of p <dig> in prostate cancer cells. using a validated cell-based assay, two compounds, small molecule inhibitors of p <dig> depletions   <dig> and  <dig>  were identified, which had the desired activity. smips restored p <dig> to physiological levels, inhibited cdk <dig> activity and caused cell cycle delay or apoptosis selectively in prostate cancer cells but not normal cells.

RESULTS
generation and validation of an lncap-derived screening cell line overexpressing skp2
prostate cancers typically display an inverse correlation between the levels of p <dig> and skp <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the commonly used human prostate cancer cell line lncap, despite faithfully recapitulating many features of human prostate cancer  <cit> , expresses relatively high levels of p <dig> but low levels of skp <dig> when compared to hela cells . in order to mimic the situation prevailing in primary prostate cancers, we created the lncap derivative cell line, lncap-s <dig>  which stably overexpresses myc-tagged skp <dig> at six to eightfold excess over endogenous skp <dig>  a manoeuvre that led to maximal downregulation of p <dig> . the same pattern was apparent by immunofluorescence staining; while nuclear levels of p <dig> are low in lncap-s <dig> cells, nuclear skp <dig> levels are highly elevated .

we also determined whether known inhibitors of p <dig> degradation could upregulate p <dig> in lncap-s <dig> cells. upon normalization to the loading control actin, the proteasome inhibitors mg <dig>  epoxomycin and bortezomib caused between  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold upregulation of p <dig>  while the cdk inhibitor roscovitine led to  <dig> -fold accumulation . the induction of nuclear p <dig> by mg <dig> and roscovitine was also apparent by immunofluorescence .

development of a high throughput screening assay to score the level of nuclear p27
the immunofluorescence assay used in figure 1c and 1e was adapted to  <dig> well plate format. all parameters, including the number of cells to be seeded, fixation, blocking conditions, antibody concentrations and incubation times with compounds were extensively optimized using positive  and negative  controls, resulting in the reliable protocol described in the methods section. representative images of lncap-s <dig> cells treated with dmso or roscovitine and stained with the above protocol in  <dig> well plates are shown in figure 1f.

in order to evaluate the performance of our assay to reliably measure the percentage of p <dig> positive cells in a cell population, we determined the z'-factor for the positive control reagent roscovitine. the z'-factor measures the variation and separation bands of an assay thereby providing a statistical measure of its quality. it takes into account the dynamic range and variability of the positive and negative control measurements  <cit> . we determined a z'-factor of  <dig>  using the imagexpress micro and metaxpress software from molecular devices  and  <dig>  using the cell lab ic <dig> and cytoshop software from beckman coulter . both values are deemed appropriate for a successful screen  <cit> . figure 1g shows the signal-to-background ratios using both imaging platforms.

primary screen
in order to assess the utility of the above protocol, we performed a pilot screen of  <dig> compounds  in duplicates for a total of  <dig> 384-well plates. lncap-s <dig> cells were incubated with individual compounds  for  <dig> h, followed by fixation, staining, imaging  and analysis as described in methods. we scored the percentage of cells positive for p <dig> in each well relative to the vehicle control . figure 2a shows the activity of positive control compounds , the negative control compound dmso , the non-specific staining  and small molecules derived from compound libraries  across all screening plates  prior to normalization. negative controls  gave basal percentages of p <dig> positive cells ranging between 2% and 13% while the positive control roscovitine increased these populations up to 50%. as expected, the average of ~ <dig> well measurements per plate - that is, the percentage of p <dig> positive cells in wells treated with individual compounds - was similar to the percentage of p <dig> positive cells in the negative control , indicating that most compounds tested were inactive in causing p <dig> accumulation .

normalization of raw data for  <dig> compounds was performed by calculating z scores, which represent the number of standard deviations by which a signal for a given compound differed from the mean signal of the entire plate  <cit> . it excludes control measurements altogether under the assumption that most compounds are inactive and can serve as intrinsic controls. the summed z scores for one set of duplicates  showed clear separation between the positive control compound roscovitine  and the non-specific staining . in addition, most summed z scores had values similar to the negative controls , indicating that we did not incur errors caused by plate position of compounds. this was further evaluated by visualizing every plate as a heat map of individual z scores. as shown in the example of a single plate in figure 2c, potential hits were randomly distributed over the plate . the analysis also identified several false-positive compounds with very high z scores, namely known dna binding compounds of red colour .

results of the primary screen
in the initial primary screen, we identified  <dig> compounds that increased the percentage of p <dig> positive lncap-s <dig> cells. upon manual examination of microscopic images,  <dig> duplicate compounds , seven obvious false positives  and  <dig> compounds with low quality staining  were sorted out. this resulted in a list of  <dig> candidates  with sixty compounds classified as strong ,  <dig> as medium  and the remainder as weak . at a z score of  <dig>  a compound has a theoretical probability of  <dig>  of being a false positive hit.

nt: not tested.

the data in the table represents the ic <dig> .

a number of experimental and clinically used chemotherapeutics such as camptothecin, thapsigargin, 17-n-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, mitomycin c and etoposide were identified . the pi <dig> kinase inhibitor wortmannin also scored positive, a finding that is consistent with the known role of the pi3k/akt pathway in the downregulation of p <dig> through skp <dig>  <cit> . we further validated some of the known bioactive compounds by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting .

secondary screening
the one hundred and nine most potent compounds  were selected for confirmation by secondary screening using the primary screening assay. after statistical analysis,  <dig> compounds were still considered positive hits . it is well established that compounds with high activity in the primary screen will appear less potent in the secondary screen because of a statistical effect known as 'regression towards the mean'  <cit> . thus, weaker hits often fail to validate in the secondary screen due to random measurement error. additional counter screening for autofluorescence identified another false-positive .

thirty-seven of the  <dig> validated compounds had known biological activity . of the remaining  <dig> compounds, none of which had known bioactivity,  <dig> were prioritized for further characterization based on features of their chemical structures. these compounds were denoted small molecule inhibitors of p <dig> depletion, smips.

activity and specificity of smips in p <dig> accumulation
sixteen of the  <dig> smips were obtainable as powders from commercial sources. the identity and integrity of all compounds was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography  and mass spectrometry . smips were retested for activity in a dose-response experiment using the primary screening assay. thirteen out of  <dig> purchased smips induced a ≥ twofold increase in the percentage of p <dig> positive cells at the maximal dose with the remaining compounds having lower activity . smip <dig> was identified as an additional false positive at this step .

several smips also induced p <dig> accumulation as determined by immunoblotting , although the effects were generally weaker . while seemingly small, such an increase is biologically significant because p <dig> levels do not vary more than two- to threefold during a normal cell cycle . this apparent discrepancy between the immunofluorescence and immunoblotting data, which we had encountered previously during assay development , is explained by the different metrics of the assays: while the immunofluorescence assay determines the percentage of cells with nuclear p <dig> staining above a threshold determined by staining with secondary antibody alone, the immunoblotting assay measures the total amount of p <dig> that can be extracted from a cell population .

further prioritization of the remaining  <dig> smips was achieved by counter screening against another unstable prostate tumour suppressor   <cit> . in order to address target specificity, lncap cells stably overexpressing nkx <dig>  fused to yellow fluorescent protein  were used. cells were treated with a single concentration  of smips in 384-well plates and analysed by automated microscopy . the z' factors for this assay, as determined by positive and negative controls, were between  <dig>   and  <dig>  , while the signal-to-background ratio was five in both cases. although some smips  caused a ~twofold increase in the percentage of nkx <dig>  positive cells, the effect was subtle in comparison to proteasome inhibitors  and could not be confirmed by immunoblotting . likewise, when the expression of endogenous nkx <dig>  was evaluated in du <dig>  another prostate cancer cell line with very low levels of nkx <dig> , none of the smips scored positive . the minor effects of some smips in the nkx <dig> -yfp fluorescence assay were most likely an artifact of compound autofluorescence at the wavelength used to excite yfp.

we also determined the effect of smips on a hela cell line stably expressing p <dig> fused to firefly luciferase   <cit> . while proteasome inhibitors led to an increase in p27-luc expression, which was readily apparent by luciferase assay  and immunoblotting , none of the smips were active. this finding suggests a certain degree of cell type specificity of smip action.

smips inhibit cell growth and induce cell death
since p <dig> can drive cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis  <cit> , we assessed the effect of smips on cell proliferation and viability. lncap-s <dig> cells and imr <dig> normal human fibroblasts were exposed to increasing concentrations of smips for  <dig> h and scored using the mtt assay followed by calculation of ic <dig> values  . whereas smip <dig> and  <dig> were moderately toxic in normal fibroblasts, smips  <dig> and  <dig> showed substantial cancer cell specificity being at least five times more potent in lncap-s <dig> than in imr <dig> cells. although smip <dig> also showed good cell type selectivity, it was excluded at this point due to structural features that suggested potential unspecific reactivity with cellular macromolecules. based on their apparent cancer cell specificity and their chemical structures, smips  <dig> and  <dig> were selected for additional studies.

smips induce dose-dependent accumulation of p <dig> and p21
in order to evaluate the dose-response of the effect on p <dig>  lncap-s <dig> cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the respective smips , and the percentage of cells with nuclear p <dig> was measured by immunofluorescence and automated microscopy. both smips led to a dose-dependent increase in p <dig> positive cells . dose-dependent increases in p <dig> and p <dig> were also observed by immunoblotting . whereas smips  <dig> led to ~threefold induction at  <dig> μm, smip <dig> was less active in this experiment causing only a modest accumulation of p <dig> .

in order to begin to determine the mode of action of smips, we measured their effects on p <dig> protein stability in a cycloheximide chase experiment. whereas the half-life of p <dig> was ~  <dig>  h in cells treated with dmso, a value that is in good agreement with published reports , treatment with either mg <dig> or smip <dig> increased p <dig> half-life to >  <dig> h . no effect on p <dig> stability was seen for smip <dig>  we also evaluated the stability of p <dig> and skp <dig> but did not see any effects of smips on these proteins. in summary, these data revealed a striking correlation between the ability of smip <dig> to downregulate skp <dig> and to induce p <dig> stabilization. in contrast, smip <dig> appears to regulate p <dig> and p <dig> primarily at the level of mrna expression .

since smip <dig> replicated the effect of mg <dig> on p <dig>  we tested whether it acts as a proteasome inhibitor. total cell lysate from lncap-s <dig> cells treated with  <dig> and  <dig> μm of the smips were analysed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody to assess the abundance of polyubiquitylated proteins. none of the compounds caused the accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins that was readily seen with the proteasome inhibitors mg <dig> and bortezomib . likewise, none of the smips inhibited the proteolytic activity of purified 26s proteasomes toward fluorogenic peptide substrates even when assayed at  <dig> μm concentration .

smips cause inhibition of cellular cdk <dig> activity, g <dig> delay and apoptosis in lncap-s <dig> cells
since smips robustly upregulated p <dig> and p <dig>  we asked whether this resulted in g <dig> delay. indeed, smips  <dig> and  <dig> induced a g <dig> delay with a concomitant decrease in the s phase population . we next asked whether the cell cycle delay coincided with inhibition of cdk <dig>  one of the major cellular target kinases of p <dig> and p <dig>  cdk2-cyclin complexes were immunoprecipitated from lysate of lncap-s <dig> cells treated with dmso, the cdk inhibitor roscovitine or smips and assayed for activity toward histone h <dig> in vitro. as with roscovitine, application of smips led to strong inhibition of the cdk <dig> activity retrieved from cells . in order to test the possibility that smips act like roscovitine as direct inhibitors of cdk <dig> kinase activity, smips were added to cdk <dig> complexes purified from untreated cells. unlike roscovitine, none of the smips inhibited cdk <dig> activity when added to the kinase reaction in vitro , indicating that the two smips are not kinase inhibitors.

the data is representative of two independent experiments.

we also evaluated the effect of smips on the levels of p <dig>  p <dig> and cyclins e and a complexed with cdk <dig> by coimmunoprecipitation. both smip <dig> and  <dig> led to a strong increase in the recruitment of p <dig> to cdk <dig>  while smip <dig> also slightly increased coprecipitation of p <dig> . smip <dig> also reduced the amounts of cyclins e and a retrieved with cdk <dig> . this was paralleled by a marked downregulation of cyclins e and a upon smip <dig> treatment . a more variable downregulation of cyclin a and cdk <dig> was observed with smip <dig> . taken together, these findings suggested that smip-induced inhibition of cdk <dig> activity might be a combined consequence of p27/p <dig> upregulation and cyclin e/a downregulation.

in order to determine the specific contribution of p <dig> and p <dig> to smip-induced cell cycle delay, we performed sirna-mediated knockdown studies. the depletion of p <dig> and p <dig> led to a decrease in the g <dig> population of untreated cells by  <dig> -  <dig> percentage points , a finding that indicates biologically significant effects at the knockdown efficiencies achieved . surprisingly, however, neither individual nor combined knockdown of the two ckis was able to abrogate smip-induced cell cycle delay . likewise, cdk <dig> activity in smip-treated cells was not rescued by knockdown of p <dig> and p <dig> . finally, neither the downregulation of cyclins e and a nor that of cdk <dig> was consistently affected by knocking down the ckis, suggesting that these effects of smips probably account primarily for their g <dig> delay activity.

in addition to g <dig> delay, treatment of lncap-s <dig> cells with smips for  <dig> h caused apoptosis as determined by the cleavage of poly-adp ribose polymerase . the apoptotic effect of smips was independently evaluated by measuring the amount of cytoplasmic histone-associated dna fragments. cells treated with  <dig> μm smip <dig> and  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> h showed a three- to fivefold increase in the amount of mono and oligonucleosomes, thus confirming the apoptosis-inducing activity of smips.

effects of smips in other prostate cancer cell lines
as shown in table  <dig>  smips also induced robust g <dig> delay in parental lncap cells as well as in two other prostate cancer cell lines, du <dig> and pc <dig>  no such effect was seen with hela cells or imr <dig> fibroblasts. in parental lncap cells, g <dig> delay correlated with an increase in the levels of p <dig> and p <dig> as well as a downregulation of cyclins a and e and cdk <dig>  which was particularly prominent with smip <dig> . unlike in skp <dig> overexpressing lncap-s <dig> cells, skp <dig> was downregulated by both smip <dig> and  <dig> in parental lncap cells, although the suppression was substantially greater with smip <dig> than  <dig> . less pronounced effects on skp <dig> were also observed in pc <dig> and du <dig> cells and in imr <dig> fibroblasts. in contrast, when averaged over four independent experiments, smips had no consistent effect on p <dig> levels in pc <dig> and du <dig> cells, although a minor increase in p <dig> levels was observed  that coincided with a modest reduction in the levels of cyclin a and cdk <dig> . none of the latter effects were apparent either in hela or imr <dig> cells. despite a lack of induction of apoptosis  or overt cytotoxicity , the smip-induced g <dig> delay of pc <dig> or du <dig> cells resulted in the same robust inhibition of colony formation in soft agar as observed in lncap-s <dig> and parental lncap cells .

the data is representative of at least four independent immunoblotting experiments.

discussion
the intimate link between p <dig> depletion and cancers deriving from the prostate and many other tissues renders pathways controlling p <dig> abundance attractive targets for the development of novel cancer therapeutics  <cit> . at the same time, the complexity and apparent redundancy of p <dig> regulatory pathways raises doubts as to whether targeting a single enzyme or proximal regulator can lead to sustained p <dig> accumulation in tumour cells. rather than screening for inhibitors of scfskp <dig> or other enzymes controlling p <dig>  we have developed a cell-based phenotypic screening system to identify compounds that can modulate the p <dig> regulatory network in cancer cells such that normal nuclear p <dig> levels are restored. the platform was validated in a pilot screen that identified two compounds of previously unknown biological activity that efficiently reversed the depletion of p <dig> in prostate cancer cells at low micromolar levels. one of these compounds, smip <dig>  increased p <dig> levels by prolonging the half-life of the p <dig> protein. therefore, p <dig> depletion can be reversed by small molecules in cancer cells overexpressing skp <dig> 

whereas the cell-based format readily revealed compounds that robustly modulated the screening endpoint - nuclear p <dig> levels - in intact cells, our pilot screen also exposed the disadvantages of this approach, namely that the molecular targets of smips remain unknown and that the modulated screening endpoint is not necessarily causal to the ultimate cellular effects of the compounds identified. for example, our rna interference studies showed that neither p <dig> nor p <dig> were required for smip-induced g <dig> delay in lncap-s <dig> cells. it is unlikely that inefficiency of the small interfering rna -mediated knockdown obscured such a requirement for smip action, since depletion of p <dig> and p <dig> decreased the fraction of cells in g <dig> thus indicating that the knockdown efficiencies achieved here were functionally consequential. in addition, p <dig> and p <dig> levels in smip-treated knockdown cells were still lower than or equal to the levels in untreated control cells, suggesting that the minor accumulation of the ckis observed upon smip administration to knockdown cells will be insufficient to cause a cell cycle arrest.

two potential explanations can be offered to rationalize the dispensability of p <dig> and p <dig> for smip-induced g <dig> delay induced by smips: first, it has been well established that mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p <dig> and p <dig> remain proficient in responding to negative proliferation signals with cell cycle arrest because the pocket proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  which have cki activity themselves, compensate for the loss of the p27/p <dig>  <cit> . secondly, smips induced downregulation of various positive cell cycle regulators, including cyclins e and a and cdk <dig>  which was fully maintained upon p <dig> and p <dig> knockdown. thus, it is conceivable that the combined effect of cyclin/cdk downregulation and cdk inhibition by pocket proteins and other ckis accounts for smip-mediated cell cycle delay in the absence of p <dig> and p <dig> 

although it appears that the compounds identified in the present pilot screen caused p <dig> upregulation as a secondary consequence of cell cycle delay, using nuclear p <dig> accumulation as a screening endpoint readily enabled the identification of cell permeable compounds with antiproliferative activity. notably, both smips show cancer cell selectivity as they induce cell cycle delay and/or apoptosis in four different prostate cancer cells but not in normal human fibroblasts. moreover, they inhibit colony formation in soft agar, which is a hallmark of the transformed phenotype of cancer cells and considered a stringent surrogate for in vivo tumour formation  <cit> . finally, when applied to a more diverse set of compounds with refined drug-like structures, our screening platform may lead to the identification of more potent and direct modulators of nuclear p <dig> accumulation, similar in characteristics to the recently identified proteasome inhibitor argyrin a, which induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis that is strictly dependent on p <dig>  <cit> .

the high content screening platform described here also enables chemical genetics strategies for the identification of novel cellular pathways and targets impinging on p <dig> - for example, the observation that smip <dig> strongly downregulates skp <dig> appears significant with regards to its mechanism of action. in a previous work we demonstrated that skp <dig> is a rate-limiting component for p <dig> degradation in lncap cells  <cit> . a recent study in mice revealed that inactivation of skp <dig> induces tumour cell senescence that is dependent upon p <dig>  p <dig> and the transcription factor atf <dig>  <cit> , which is an integral component of the unfolded protein response  that is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. although the exact mechanism by which smip <dig> downregulates skp <dig> is presently unknown, we have observed a robust activation of upr signalling by the compound . a similar downregulation of skp <dig> has been noticed with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which is also an upr inducer  <cit> . mechanism of action studies on smip <dig> are therefore beginning to suggest a link between upr-mediated downregulation of skp <dig> and the accumulation of p <dig> . however, a substantial future effort will be required to decipher the exact molecular targets of the compounds identified here. once those are revealed, target directed high throughput screening campaigns could be initiated to identify a more diverse set of compounds with improved potency toward p <dig> and clinical potential.

CONCLUSIONS
the results shown here provide proof-of-principle that the cell-based screen we developed provides an effective means of identifying bioactive molecules with cancer selective antiproliferative activity. the advantage of a cell-based screening format is, however, offset by the limitation that the modulated endpoint is not necessarily causal to the ultimate cellular effects of identified compounds, thus requiring additional pathway deconvolution studies. nevertheless, this approach can be applied to larger and more diverse sets of compounds with refined drug-like properties, revealing both unknown cellular pathways globally impinging on p <dig> and novel chemotherapeutic lead agents.
