BACKGROUND
glutarimides are the hydrolyzed cyclic imides formed as a result of cyclization of glutamine. these compounds particularly, the α-amino glutarimides are important components of many extremely valuable drugs. the glutarimide moiety is present in a great number of molecules and has a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. many glutarimides have been reported to show notable anticancer activity, cytotoxicity against kb cells in vitro, and are also potent inhibitors of p <dig> murine leukemia in vivo  <cit> . since aminoglutethimide inhibits steroidogenesis at the aromatase sites, it is used in treating metastatic breast cancer  <cit> . antineoplaston a <dig> - <dig> -dioxo-3-piperidyl]-2-phenyl-acetamide) is another glutarimide derivative, originally isolated from human urine. it has remarkable anticancer activity but lacks the toxicity of other common cancer drugs  <cit> . it has been suggested that a <dig> acts directly at the genomic level and alters the cellular responsiveness to steroidal hormones  <cit> . thalidomides have special clinical value in a number of pathological conditions such as erythema nodosum leprosum, rheumatoid arthritis, hiv-associated oral ulcers, and chronic graft versus host diseases  <cit> . both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that thalidomides have the ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α and its production  <cit> . fda has approved this drug for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum  and multiple myeloma  <cit> . many glutarimide derivatives are partial agonists of the central nervous system  and their actions range from convulsive and analeptic  to anticonvulsive and hypnotic . the importance of glutarimide moeties in antibiotics such as the cycloheximides is well known and they act by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial peptides at the initiation and extension steps  <cit> . however, the present study elucidates and reports a new function of α-amino glutarimide as a potent facilitator of agrobacterium infection of generally resistant host plants. the study also shows that α-amino glutarimide is a major product formed as a result of chemical modification of l-glutamine upon autoclaving.

infection of target host and non host plants by engineered agrobacterium tumefaciens is required for the production of tailor made transgenic plants expressing useful yield and quality enhancing genes  <cit> . as compared to direct transformation methods, agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation allows higher frequency of stable transgene expression  <cit> . hence this method has been employed to produce a large number of transgenic plants till date. even the natural barriers that prevent the use of agrobacterium as a vector for genetic transformation of monocots have now been overcome through the use of several innovative approaches, and several crop plants have been successfully transformed  <cit> . yet, quite a good number of crops, particularly, several important ones that exude bacteriostatic or bactericidal leachates as plant defense have remained outside agrobacterium's host range, and gene transfer into them is largely difficult. it is while targeting such 'difficult to transform crops' for transgenic production by agrobacaterium tumefaciens, that α-amino glutarimide can prove extremely useful.

methods
aqueous solution of l-glutamine at a concentration of  <dig>  g litre- <dig>  was autoclaved at 121°c and  <dig> psi for  <dig> and  <dig> minutes and lyophilized to afford gla <dig> and gla <dig>  respectively. the same concentration of aqueous l-glutamine solution that was not autoclaved but filter sterilized served as control .

chemical characterization of autoclaved products
gla <dig>  gla <dig> and control were subjected to tlc in order to study the structural changes in l-glutamine due to thermal degradation by autoclaving. samples spotted on tlc plates were run in solvent systems comprising of butanol:water:acetic acid:: 4:1: <dig> and n-propanol:2-propanol:water:: 4:3: <dig> followed by heating at 300°c in an oven for  <dig> minutes. visual changes in color and rf values of the spots were noted after spraying ninhydrin reagent on chromatographed tlc plate.

the autoclaved samples  were also characterized by modern spectroscopic techniques i.e. nmr and esi-ms. nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker avance- <dig> spectrometer. mass spectra were recorded on qtof-micro of waters micromass.

agrobacterium growth in response to autoclaved products
the engineered agrobacterium tumefaciens strain, gv <dig> containing the plasmid p35sgusint with the gus reporter and nptii selection marker genes was used. to fresh cultures of this strain harvested at an optical density  of  <dig>  at a <dig> nm,  <dig>  g litre- <dig> of gla <dig>  gla <dig> and gfs  were added and grown overnight as shake cultures in  <dig> ml yeast mannitol broth  in dark at 28°c and  <dig> rpm for  <dig> hrs. in another experiment, freshly revived cultures of a. tumefaciens was grown in liquid basal ms medium  <cit>  containing either of  <dig>  g l- <dig> gfs, gla <dig>  gla <dig> maintained at different ph i.e.,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . growth in response to  <dig>  g l- <dig> 5-oxo proline  in ms and ymb was also tested at these phs. all the results were confirmed using  <dig> % agar solidified ymb and ms medium.

for each of these experiments, cultures grown in medium free of gfs, gla <dig>  gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline served as control. a minimum of three replicates per treatment were used. growth in each case as represented by population density  at a <dig> nm ×  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml-1) was measured at regular  <dig> hr interval for  <dig> and  <dig> hrs of incubation in case of liquid and solid media, respectively.

agrobacterium virulence  gene induction assay
vir gene induction by the autoclaved products was tested using an octopine-type agrobacterium strain a <dig> harboring the psm <dig> plasmid with lacz under the control of virh promoter in trans to the wild-type ptia <dig> plasmid  <cit> . gla <dig>  gla <dig> or gfs were added to overnight grown bacterial cultures in ymb. the reporter β-galactosidase activity was measured, and the results were expressed in specific units calculated as described  <cit> . the popular vir gene inducer as  was used as a positive control for its maximal vir gene induction ability.

facilitation of agrobacterium infection of plants by the autoclaved products of l-glutamine
the effect of gla <dig>  gla <dig> or gfs on agrobacterium infection of plants was tested using tender leaves of a number of plant species like podophyllum hexandrum , aloe vera , lavendula officinalis , rosa sp. , malus domestica  rootstock mm <dig>  dendrocalamus asper , cynodon dactylon , zea mays , oryza sativa , triticum aestivum , aurocaria  and dryopteris . the leaves of nicotiana tabacum  served as control.

all the leaves were washed with tween  <dig> and surface sterilized using  <dig> % mercuric chloride for 5- <dig> min followed by thorough rinsing in sterile de-ionized water to remove all traces of mercuric chloride. the surface sterilized leaves were immersed for  <dig> min in fresh overnight grown culture of a. tumefaciens strain gv <dig> and co-cultivated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days at 28°c in dark after blotting off excess bacteria. basal ms medium containing  <dig>  g l- <dig> of either of gla <dig>  gla <dig>  5-oxoproline and gfs was used for co-cultivation. after each co-cultivation period, cefotaxime at  <dig> g l- <dig> was used to wash the explants free of all residual agrobacterium which were cultured on basal ms medium containing  <dig> μm tdz and  <dig> μm naa  at ph  <dig>  under culture lab conditions for callus formation. in order to identify the optimal conditions, different ph, i.e.,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the co-cultivation medium containing  <dig>  g l- <dig> of gla <dig> were also tested.

in another experiment, leaves of different plant species  were also transformed using different densities of agrobacterium equivalent to  <dig> ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> at a <dig> nm. these were then co-cultivated on medium supplemented with either of gfs, gla <dig>  gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline at ph  <dig> .

agrobacterium infected explants co-cultivated on medium containing  <dig> μm as but free of gfs, gla <dig>  gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline supplements served as positive control. a minimum of five replicates with three leaves per plant species were taken for each experiment which were repeated at least thrice.

gus assay
the histo-chemical assay of jefferson et al.  <cit>  was used to assess the success of transgene delivery into explants. after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of co-cultivation, explants, treated  and control  were randomly selected and immersed in assay buffer containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-ß-d-glucuronide  followed by vacuum infiltration for  <dig> minutes. after an overnight incubation in dark at 37°c, the expression of gus reporter gene was scored as blue spots and/or sectors per leaf explant and photographed using a sony cybershot dsc-f- <dig> camera. gus assay was also done for the leaf explants transformed using different densities of agrobacterium followed by co-cultivation on medium containing gfs, gla <dig>  gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline as well as control.

pcr confirmation of genetic transformation
callus tissue formed on the leaf explants of different plant species transformed in the presence and absence of either gfs, gla <dig>  gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline were selected on msc containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin. as described by doyle and doyle  <cit> , total genomic dna was extracted from the kanamycin resistant calli . these were pcr amplified using  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min, annealing at 55°c for  <dig> min and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min followed by further extension cycle of  <dig> min at 72°c using a programmable stratagene robocycler gradient  <dig>  the isolated genomic dna  was amplified using  <dig> μm dntps,  <dig>  u taq dna polymerase and  <dig> pmol of forward and reverse primers i.e., 5'-ggtgggaaagcgcgttacaag-3' and 5'-tggatcccggcatagttaaa-3', respectively  designed so as to amplify a  <dig> bp fragment of the gus gene). while  <dig> pg of plasmid dna served as positive control, dna from untransformed tissues were used as negative controls. the amplified products were finally resolved on  <dig> % agarose gel using a 0'generuler™  <dig> bp plus dna ladder from fermentas, life sciences. plant species  that failed to produce leaf callus were not subjected to pcr.

southern hybridization
genomic dna was isolated from callus tissues of different plant species transformed in presence and absence of α-amino glutarimide. the isolated dna  were digested with hindiii and ecori  and resolved on  <dig> % agarose gel along with a 0'generuler™  <dig> bp plus dna ladder . this was then blotted onto a nylon membrane  and hybridized with pcr amplified plasmid gus gene probe labeled with biotin using biotin decalabel dna labeling kit, fermentas, life sciences. the chromogenic substrate bcip/nbt  was used to detect the hybridization products of the biotinylated probe and the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate as blue-purple colored bands.

RESULTS
chemical characterization of autoclaved products
the yield of gla <dig> and gla <dig> was found in the range of 92-95%. while gla <dig> was observed in white crystalline powder, gla <dig> was a creamy white powder. the latter was highly hygroscopic and turned into a pale yellow sticky mass within an hour under ambient conditions.

thin layer chromatography
tlc analysis of gla <dig>  gla <dig> and gfs showed distinct differences in their rf values. gla <dig> showed only one spot at rf  <dig> , hence, confirmed the formation of only one product . however, in case of gla <dig>  one major spot was observed at rf  <dig>  together with a minor spot at rf  <dig> . the observation suggested the presence of one major compound  along with a minor compound  in gla <dig>  the difference in the rf values of both products from gfs  indicated the transformation of l-glutamine upon autoclaving.

nmr and mass spectroscopy
the nmr spectral data  provided evidence for gla <dig> and gla <dig> being two structurally different compounds .

gla <dig> was identified as 5-oxo proline  on the basis of comparison of nmr and mass spectral data with reported values. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  of gla <dig> showed protonated molecular ion at m/z  <dig> + which corresponded to the molecular formula c5h7no <dig> 

13c nmr spectrum of gla <dig> was dominant with the signals of major product  that showed  <dig> carbon resonances, of which two are observed at δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  for carbonyls. a downfield shift of these resonances when compared with parent compound  indicated presence of a cyclic ring. the other  <dig> carbons resonated at δ  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . considerable shifts in these resonances in comparison to the respective resonances of control  provided further support for the cyclic structure for product iii. dept  <dig> experiment revealed the nature of these three resonances as two ch <dig> at δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  and one as ch at δ  <dig> . in 1h nmr spectrum, three multiplets were observed at δ  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , each integrating for two, two and one proton, respectively. the multiplet patterns of these three proton resonances due to mutual scalar couplings indicate that they are connected in series. the coupling pattern was further confirmed by cosy. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  of gla <dig> showed protonated molecular ion at m/z  <dig> + for major product  which corresponded to the molecular formula c5h8n2o <dig>  the structural elucidation of compound iii finally revealed complete cyclization of glutamine during autoclaving. hmqc and hmbc study further confirmed the loss of a molecule of water to form compound iii i.e. α-amino glutarimide or 3-amino- <dig> -piperidinedione .

the results clearly suggested that the formation of α-amino glutarimide  was preferred over pyroglutamic acid  when l-glutamine was over autoclaved.

α-amino glutarimide: 1h nmr δ:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ; 13c nmr δ:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ; esi-ms m/z:  <dig> +.

agrobacterium growth in response to autoclaved products of l-glutamine
a. tumefaciens growth was more pronounced at ph  <dig>  as compared to acidic ph , irrespective of supplements , and a similar trend was recorded in both ymb and ms . however, growth was remarkably higher in ymb as compared to ms. as compared to control, maximum growth was recorded at ph  <dig>  in the presence of gla <dig> . while growth in the presence of gla <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, that in the presence of 5-oxo proline was about  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold in ymb and ms, respectively. growth in the presence of gfs was always lower than control, irrespective of culture media. at acidic ph of ymb ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , growth was lower than that in the presence of gfs , gla <dig>  and 5-oxo proline . however, about  <dig>  fold growth was recorded in the presence of gla <dig> . in case of ms, a trend similar to that in ymb was observed. while growth was lower by  <dig>  fold in the presence of gfs, it ranged between  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold in the presence of gla <dig> and 5-oxo proline. however, growth in presence of gla <dig> was  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold.

β-galactosidase activity as a measure of agrobacterium virulence  gene induction
considerably high β-galactosidase activity was recorded in the presence of as, a known vir gene inducer. however, the activity of control  was lower than that in the presence of as . while the activities were  <dig>  and  <dig>  miller units in the presence of gfs and gla <dig>  respectively, suppression  was observed in the presence of gla <dig> 

agrobacterium infection of resistant host plants by autoclaved products of l-glutamine
a. tumefaciens growth on leaf explants varied with plant species when transformed with different cell densities and co-cultivated on ms supplemented with gla <dig>  no growth was observed on any of the explants when transformed with  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> of a. tumefaciens followed by co-cultivation on ms containing either of gfs, gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline. slight a. tumefaciens growth was however, recorded on explants of bamboo, maize and apple rootstock transformed using a cell density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> followed by co-cultivation in the presence of gla <dig>  no explant, except tobacco showed a. tumefaciens growth when co-cultivated on control medium after transformation using cell densities up to  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  however, explants of apple rootstock, bamboo, maize, and rice showed slight growth on control medium at all tested cell densities beyond  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> 

growth increased with further increase in cell density i.e., lowest at  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> and highest at  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in case of indian may apple, aloe, lavender, wild rose, apple rootstock, bamboo, grass, maize and rice; and also in the leaf explants of fern and aurocaria when co-cultivated on ms containing gla <dig> . even in case of control i.e., in the absence of supplements, a. tumefaciens growth was observed on apple rootstock and rice when they were transformed using either of  <dig> ×  <dig> or  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  however, a. tumefaciens failed to grow on any of the explants when either gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline was present in the co-cultivation medium, irrespective of cell densities, .

when ph of the co-cultivation medium was considered, depending upon the plant species, slight to profuse growth was recorded on or around the explants in the acidic ph range only. in contrast, no a. tumefaciens growth was recorded on or around the explant surface at ph  <dig> , irrespective of supplements.

gus expression
gus expression varied with a. tumefaciens density, plant species or presence or absence of gla <dig> . irrespective of the presence or absence of gla <dig> in the co-cultivation medium, tobacco showed gus expression at all cell densities ranging from  <dig> × <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  on the other hand, the presence of gla <dig> or 5-oxo proline failed to induce gus expression in all the studied plant species including tobacco.

where cont* = control; + = one to five tiny blue spots; ++ = one to two large blue spots; +++ = small or faint blue patches; ++++ = large blue patch covering almost quarter of the leaf surface; and +++++ = entire leaf showed distinct blue color

gus expression improved with increase in a. tumefaciens cell densities from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in the presence of gla <dig> in case of apple rootstock, bamboo and maize; and from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in indian may apple, aloe, lavender, grass and rice. however, the best response in terms of strong gus expression spread over a larger area was recorded, only when  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> of a. tumefaciens was used, irrespective of plant species . increase in cell density beyond  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> had no effect on gus expression  in case of aloe, grass, maize, rice, aurocaria and fern. on the other hand, with time, the explants turned necrotic due to a. tumefaciens overgrowth at  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in case of tobacco, indian may apple, lavender, wild rose and apple rootstock.

the leaf explants of all the studied plant species showed gus expression only in the acidic ph range when co-cultivated on msc containing gla <dig>  however, the ph optima and the intensity of expression varied with the plant species tested . while the leaf explants of tobacco, lavender, apple rootstock, bamboo, maize and rice showed gus expression at all ph in the acidic range , those of indian may apple, wild rose and grass showed gus expression at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  only. on the other hand, the explants of aloe and fern tested positive when co-cultivated at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , whereas, that in aurocaria was best observed at ph  <dig>  only.

where + = one to five tiny blue spots; ++ = one to two large blue spots; +++ = small or faint blue patches; ++++ = large blue patch covering almost quarter of the leaf surface; +++++ = entire leaf showed distinct blue color and - = no gus expression 

in case of media containing  <dig> μm as, but free of all glutamine supplements, longer co-cultivation time was required for the explants of wild rose, apple rootstock, bamboo, grass, maize, rice and fern . the only exception was tobacco where <  <dig> day of co-cultivation was sufficient for strong gus expression. on the other hand, no gus expression was observed in explants of any of the plant species co-cultivated at ph  <dig>  .

pcr confirmation of genetic transformation
pcr amplification products of about  <dig> bp corresponding to gus gene were observed in the leaf calli of aloe, lavender, tobacco, rose, grass, fern and apple rootstock and maize provided gla <dig> was present in the co-cultivation medium . however, amplification was not detected in the calli derived from explants co-cultivated on either control or on media containing gfs, gla <dig> or as.

southern hybridization
genomic dna of calli derived from aloe, wild rose, maize, fern, lavender and grass leaves transformed using a. tumefaciens density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> and co-cultivated in the presence of gla <dig> tested positive in southern hybridization and distinct purple-blue signals were detected . however, no hybridization signals were observed in case of leaf calli obtained from explants co-cultivated in the presence of as but in absence of gla <dig> . hybridization signals were also not detected in the untransformed leaf calli of the studied plant species . only tobacco and apple rootstock mm <dig> showed the hybridization signals both in the presence or absence of gla <dig> in the co-cultivation medium . a distinct single band  was observed in case of aloe . while a distinctly sharp band of >  <dig> kb was observed along with >  <dig>  kb and  <dig> bp bands in wild rose , four bands above  <dig> kb and two bands of about  <dig>  kb and  <dig> bp were observed in maize . no signal was observed in case of fern  whereas, two sharp bands of about  <dig>  kb and  <dig> bp were observed in case of lavender . three distinct bands  were observed in case of grass .

discussion
l-glutamine is a highly thermolabile and non-volatile biomolecule that is chemically modified into different compounds at high temperatures. when present in aqueous solution at ph values that are not extreme, l-glutamine is transformed in two step reactions, first into glutamic acid and then into pyroglutamic acid or 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid or 5-oxo proline and ammonia  <cit> . besides 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid  <cit> , l-glutamine undergoes pyrolysis at temperatures as high as 300°c leading to the formation of nitrogen containing heterocycles  <cit> . the additional single methylene group in the side chain allows the free form of glutamine to cyclize and de-amidate spontaneously into pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, a five-membered ring structure found at the n-terminus of many immunoglobulin polypeptides  <cit> . in the present study also, l-glutamine underwent cyclization to form 5-oxoproline and α-amino glutarimide. however, this occurred when l-glutamine was autoclaved at 121°c and  <dig> psi for  <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively . further chemical investigations using tlc and different spectroscopic methods revealed that irrespective of the duration of autoclaving, both the compounds could be detected in the same sample. however, the amount of α-amino glutarimide was more  when the aqueous solution of l-glutamine was autoclaved for  <dig> min. this indicated the possibility of easy synthesis of α-amino glutarimide simply by autoclaving aqueous solutions of l-glutamine for  <dig> min. it would be pertinent to mention that in general, the synthesis of the glutarimide ring requires a minimum of 2- <dig> step reactions  <cit> .

glutarimides are extremely valuable biomolecules that act as a carrier or vector for transporting biologically active functional groups through cell membranes. the structural features and physiochemical properties of the glutarimide moiety is remarkably similar to the uracil derivatives. therefore, it interacts with specific receptors involved in transport of uracil and thymine nucleosides across biological membranes  <cit> . being a constituent of a large number of other important compounds, the glutarimide moeity possesses a broad spectrum of pharmacological and anticancer properties  <cit> . particularly,  <dig> -piperidinedione, a glutarimide with an intact imide group  substituted at α and β position in the ring acts as a powerful inhibitor of human rhinovirus 3c protease  <cit> . however, in the present study α-amino glutarimide was found to have a new function of facilitating agrobacterium infection of different susceptible and resistant plant species that ranged from host to non-hosts . the present study also found that neither 5-oxoproline nor 3-amino glutarmide are inducers of the vir regulon . rather, the compound promoted a. tumefaciens growth resulting in an increase in population density. however, increase in population density beyond  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> was found to have a detrimental effect on transformation efficiency . this led us to hypothesize that α-amino glutarimide formed due to autoclaving of l-glutamine was probably responsible for the xenobiotic quenching of the toxic wound exudates from resistant explants as has been indicated in tea  <cit> . this appears to be so because most of the plant species that were tested in the present study, leached exudates that not only killed the studied explants  but also retarded a. tumefaciens growth as has been shown in tea in our earlier study  <cit> . these bactericidal leachates probably killed or prevented the chemotaxis of an optimal a. tumefaciens population density required for explant infection. not surprisingly, the possibility of a strong negative influence by the toxic polyphenolic exudates on the chemotactic movement of agrobacteria towards the explant has been considered  <cit> . on the other hand, when the bactericidal-explant-exudates were possibly quenched by α-amino glutarimide, the requisite population density of a. tumefaciens which would otherwise have been repelled or killed, were now allowed to move towards the explants for infection .

however, the activity of gla <dig> was found to be ph dependant. while agrobacterium growth was enhanced at ph  <dig> , infectivity of explants of many of the studied plant species was mostly enhanced at ph  <dig>  and some at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , but never at ph  <dig>  . this indicated the necessity of manipulation of ph of the media containing this compound for its appropriate utilization. actually, vir gene induction and consequent agrobacterium infection of plants is best facilitated at acidic ph  <cit> . however, the ph optima are known to vary with plant species for agrobacterium virulence and gene transfer  <cit> . designing adequate artificial environment and manipulation of wound responses of plant tissues has facilitated successful genetic transformation of many plant species by favoring plant-a. tumefaciens interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
5-oxo proline and α-amino glutarimide were synthesized from l-glutamine upon autoclaving at 121°c and  <dig> psi for  <dig> or  <dig> min. although the compound did not have any vir gene inducing property, α-amino glutarimide facilitated agrobacterium infection of a number of resistant to susceptible plants successfully.
