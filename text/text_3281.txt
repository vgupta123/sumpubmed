BACKGROUND
herpes simplex virus  is a major cause of encephalitis in humans  <cit> . conventional treatment of hsv- <dig> encephalitis  involves the use of antiviral therapies, current guidelines for the treatment of hsv- <dig> recommend intravenous acyclovir  <cit> . however, there is some evidence showing that modulation of inflammatory response may be beneficial  <cit> . in this regard, kamei and coworkers  <cit>  showed that higher proinflammatory cytokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid  from hse patients were associated with a worse outcome of the disease and the decrease in cytokine levels after corticosteroid treatment resulted in a better outcome. therefore the severity of the hse depends at least in part on the inflammatory response  <cit> .

the inflammatory response in the central nervous system  may lead to neuroaxonal damage. one of the characteristics of an inflammatory environment is the recruitment of leukocytes, which can pass through the blood–brain barrier. the recruitment of leukocytes is composed of a series of events which are dependent on multiple protein interactions  <cit> . intravital microscopy studies allow the visualization of leukocyte/endothelial cell interaction in vessels in vivo and have revealed that leukocytes must first tether and roll along the venular wall before they can attach firmly and emigrate out of the vasculature  <cit> .

molecules called chemokines  are essential in the recruitment of leukocytes. chemokines act mainly on the adhesion step of this highly regulated process, contributing to the migration process  <cit> .

the chemokines ccl2/mcp- <dig>  ccl3/mip-1α, ccl5/rantes and cxcl-8/il- <dig>   <cit>  are increased in the brain of patients with hse. ccl5/rantes is a chemokine member of cc family that recruits monocytes, t cells, basophils and eosinophils, acting via the receptors ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  <cit> . chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. for instance, ccr <dig> is a g-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in different cell types like t cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and microglia, and that binds to several chemokines, including: ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig>   <cit> . besides the cc family of chemokines, there is also the cxc family of chemokines, which is important in the chemotaxis of several immune cells. for example, kc/cxcl- <dig> and mig/cxcl <dig> are chemokines that attract neutrophils and t cell to the inflammatory site, respectively. kc presents a chemotactic role similar to that played by the human cxcl <dig> 

our research group has established a murine model of hsv- <dig> encephalitis in which intracranial inoculation of a neurotropic hsv- <dig> strain causes signs of encephalitis and death a few days after infection  <cit>  in contrast with the nasal infection in which mice do not develop encephalitis  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that leukocyte rolling and adhesion in the brain microvasculature of hsv- <dig> infected mice was associated with the increased expression of chemokines in the brain  <cit> .

in this experimental model, mice infected with hsv- <dig> and treated with a polyclonal anti-ccl <dig> antibody two hours before the intravital microscopy decreased leukocyte adhesion in the microcirculation  <cit> . these results led us to evaluate the specific role of ccr <dig> receptor, a receptor for ccl5/rantes, in this model. ccr <dig> is constitutively expressed in astrocytes, microglia and neurons  <cit> . its role in the healthy brain is still poorly understood, but ccr <dig> seems to regulate leukocyte maturation and trafficking in models of brain disease  <cit> .

here we investigated the effect of the lack of ccr <dig> in the trafficking of leukocytes, infiltration of immune cells, cerebral levels of cytokines/chemokines and viral load in a model of severe hsv- <dig> encephalitis.

RESULTS
wt and ccr5-/- infected animals present similar survival curves
wild-type  c57bl/ <dig> and ccr5-/- mice were infected with  <dig> pfu of neurotropic hsv- <dig>  wt and ccr5-/- animals presented similar survival curves, with 100% of mortality at 4 days post-infection  . using a non-lethal  <dig> pfu inoculum all mice had an increase in survival rate , remaining no difference between wt and ccr5-/- experimental groups. these results were confirmed in two independent experiments.

ccr5-/- infected animals present changes in viral load
viral load in the brain was significantly lower in infected ccr5-/- mice when compared to wt infected mice at 1dpi .

hsv- <dig> infection increased inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, in the brain
facs was used to determine the specific immune cell composition of brain infiltrates, targeting neutrophils, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. control mice had fewer neutrophils, cd4+ and cd8+ infiltrating cells compared to infected mice.

the total number of immune cells in brain was significantly higher in ccr5-/- mice when compared to infected wt mice. the brain of ccr5-/- infected mice presented a significantly higher number of neutrophils, characterized as cd11+ ly6g+ cells, compared with wt infected mice. the number of cd4+ t cells was similar in both ccr5-/- and wt infected mice. conversely the number of cd8+ t cells was higher in wt infected mice when compared with ccr5-/- infected mice .

ccr5-/- infected mice present higher infiltration of leukocytes in the meninges
histophatological analysis was performed to indicate the localization of inflammatory cells. brain slides from wt and ccr5-/- control groups did not present histological changes. ccr5-/- infected mice showed a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration in the meninges when compared with wt infected mice. among inflammatory cells, polimorphonuclear cells, mainly neutrophils were the predominant inflammatory leukocytes found in the brain of ccr5-/- infected mice .

ccr5-/- infected mice present higher leukocyte adhesion
intravital microscopy was done to visualize rolling and adhered leukocytes in meningeal vessels to understand the involvement of ccr <dig> receptor in the recruitment process. after  <dig> dpi, no differences in the number of rolling leukocytes were found between infected groups. adhered leukocytes were significantly increased in infected ccr5-/- mice when compared to infected wt mice .

cytokines and chemokines are increased in ccr5-/- infected mice
after intravital microscopy, the brain was removed to evaluate the levels of the chemokines kc/cxcl <dig>  mig/cxcl <dig>  mcp-1/ccl <dig>  rantes/ccl <dig> and the cytokine tnf-α by elisa. at 1dpi, all chemokines and cytokine tnf-α were significantly increased in infected ccr5-/- mice when compared to infected wt mice .

discussion
in the present work, we showed that ccr5-/- mice infected with hsv- <dig> virus present an increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in the brain, composed mainly of neutrophils. in comparison with infected wt animals, ccr5-/- mice also presented a reduction in hsv- <dig> load, while no changes were found in survival rate.

previous studies have shown that c57bl/ <dig> mice infected with hsv- <dig> strain ek did not develop encephalitis by peripheral  route  <cit> . therefore, we standardized a model of infection by inoculating the virus hsv- <dig> strain ek by intracranial route. this route is associated with a severe disease characterized by diffuse meningoencephalitis in contrast with focal lesions determined by nasal or ocular inoculation  <cit> .

the inoculum of  <dig> pfu resulted in elevated rates of mortality in both wt and ccr5-/- mice, suggesting that this viral load may be lethal regardless of the immune or inflammatory pathways involved. this prompted us to use a lower inoculum but the mortality rate of both groups remained similar. interestingly, ccr5-/- mice infected with hsv- <dig> virus by ocular route also showed no difference in mortality rate when compared to wt mice  <cit> .

a lower hsv- <dig> load was observed in ccr5-/- infected mice. this might suggest either that the virus presented a diminished replication rate or that the inflammatory response could be enhancing viral clearance in the brain. both situations may be ascribed to the change in the type of cells infiltrating the brain. histopathology and flow cytometry analysis showed an early increase in the number of total cells in the brain of ccr5-/- mice, especially neutrophils. neutrophils may contribute to virus clearance through the release of antiviral cytokines like tnf-α or oxygen and nitrogen reactive species  <cit> .

neutrophils are the first cells to infiltrate the cornea and they remain the predominant cell type during the development of hsv- <dig> keratitis  <cit> . this neutrophil response is known to both inhibit viral replication and induce corneal lesion  <cit> . in contrast with the present results, carr and coworkers  <cit>  found decreased neutrophil recruitment into the cornea and trigeminal ganglia in the early stage of hsv- <dig> infection by corneal route in ccr5-/- mice. the number of recruited neutrophils in the cornea became similar in wt and ccr5-/- mice only at day  <dig> p.i. interestingly, there was increase in viral load in ccr5-/- mice at day  <dig> p.i. which was probably secondary to defective neutrophil trafficking during the earlier stages of infection. at the same time, trigeminal ganglia and brainstems of ccr5-/- mice revealed an increase of cd <dig> and/or cd <dig> t cells  <cit> .

in the present work, there was also a significant change in leukocyte recruitment during hsv- <dig> brain infection. however, in contrast with a previous work  <cit> , ccr5-/- infected mice showed an increase of neutrophil recruitment in detriment of the cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells recruitment in brain tissue. these conflicting results suggest that there is a significant difference between the immune response elicited in the periphery  and the response in the cns in ccr5-/- mice infected with hsv- <dig>  when the virus is inoculated in peripheral sites, such as cornea, an immune response against hsv- <dig> can develop in trigeminal ganglia and related lymph nodes. this response can modulate the immune response before hsv- <dig> reaches the cns, differing from the current study in which the virus was directly inoculated in the brain. previous studies involving other knock out mice have also demonstrated conflicting data depending on the route of hsv- <dig> inoculation. for instance, lundberg and coworkers  <cit>  demonstrated that tnf-α antiviral effects are independent of tnfr <dig> in mice infected with hsv- <dig> by corneal scarification. when the virus was inoculated in the periphery of c57bl/ <dig> mice, immune response of the host efficiently controlled virus infection even without tnfr <dig>  <cit> . conversely, it was described a significant decrease in the survival rate of tnfr1−/− mice infected by intracranial route  <cit> . the use of intracranial route is a way to elicit an immune response directly from the cns, aiming to exclude immune activation in the periphery. in this regard, tnfr <dig> seemed to be relevant for the control of hsv- <dig> replication in cns when there is no activation of the immune system in the periphery  <cit> .

in contrast to neutrophil increase, the brain of ccr5-/- infected mice showed a reduction of cd8+ cells. ccr <dig> is a member of the cc family of chemokine receptors that is expressed on a variety of leukocytes, including t cells and macrophages  <cit> . accordingly, it would be expected that, without ccr <dig>  recruitment of t cells might be reduced. the number of cd8+ t cells was also decreased in the brain of mouse hepatitis virus-infected ccr5-/- mice as compared to wt mice  <cit> .

macrophages, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells are present in perivascular infiltrates close to and in contact with hsv-infected cells in areas of massive myelin loss necrosis in the brainstem of mice with hsv encephalitis  <cit> . cd8+ t lymphocytes are the first mononuclear cells that cross the blood brain barrier and move toward the infected tissue. the role played by cd8+ lymphocytes in hsv- <dig> encephalitis is still controversial. while one study reported no significant differences in viral load or viral reactivation when the virus was injected in cornea of mice lacking cd8+ t cells  <cit> , another report showed persistent elevated viral titers in the brain of cd8-deficient, suggesting a role for cd8+ t cells in the control of hsv- <dig> replication  <cit> . in the current study, we found no difference in the levels of cd8+ lymphocytes in ccr5-/- mice, thus, these cells cannot account for the decrease in viral load in the brain of ccr5-/- mice. following cd8+ t lymphocytes, tissue-penetrating th <dig> cd4+ t cells contact local antigen presenting cells. this may result in an up-regulation of mhc molecules and secretion of more chemotactic molecules  <cit> . the inflammatory site during encephalitis involves the immune cells cited above and also b cells. mice deficient for b cell had increased susceptibility to hsv- <dig> after peritoneal infection, presenting increased viral replication in the cns. thus, those results evidenced the importance of b cells in the control of viral replication.

interestingly, treatment with anti-ccl <dig> or met-rantes, an antagonist of the ccl <dig> receptors ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  had no effect on viral titers but significantly decreased the number of leukocytes adherent to the pial microvasculature  <cit> . ccl5/rantes is able to bind other chemokine receptors like ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  possibly compensating the absence of ccr <dig> in the trafficking and migration of leukocytes  <cit> . using intravital microscopy, we found that ccr5-/- infected mice presented an increase of leukocyte adhesion to the pial microvasculature. bearing in mind that ccr <dig> is one of the most important receptors in leukocyte migration, this result seems paradoxical. however, one limitation of this technique is the impossibility to identify the kind of leukocyte that roll and adhere in vessels  <cit> . it is possible that those leukocytes observed in intravital microscopy are neutrophils.

here we found an increase in cerebral chemokine levels, including kc/cxcl <dig>  mig/cxcl <dig>  mcp-1/ccl <dig>  rantes/ccl <dig> and cytokine tnf-α in ccr5-/- infected mice. blocking the action of ccl <dig> receptor may result in compensatory mechanisms leading to the overproduction of other chemokines  <cit> . thapa and coworkers  <cit>  showed that mice deficient in ccr <dig> expressed higher levels of tnf-α, kc/cxcl <dig>  mcp-1/ccl <dig>  mip1-α/ccl <dig> and rantes/ccl <dig> in the brain after intravaginally hsv- <dig> infection. ccr5-/- mice showed a significant elevation in chemokines mcp-1/ccl <dig>  rantes/ccl <dig>  mig/cxcl <dig> and ip10/cxcl <dig> in the trigeminal ganglion and brainstem after ocular hsv- <dig> infection  <cit> .

the increase in chemokine concentration within the brain was also found in a study addressing the role of cxcr <dig> in hsv- <dig> infection. this receptor is expressed predominantly on cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, subsets of nk cells, and peripheral blood b cells. cxcr3-/- mice infected with hsv- <dig> in the cornea had an increase in ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and ifn-γ in the brainstem and il- <dig> in the brain tissue. in addition, cxcr3-/- infected mice exhibited high levels of chemokines which were coincident with high viral titers in the brainstem. the authors suggested that the absence of cxcr <dig> expression would suppress the capacity of t cells to respond to hsv- <dig> infection through limited trafficking to the trigeminal ganglia  <cit> .

in our study, the lack of ccr <dig> was associated with lower viral load, implicating this receptor in viral multiplication. however, it is not clear whether the virus depends on this receptor to enhance viral multiplication or the immune system mounts a different response in its absence, resulting in more efficient viral control.

our study has several limitations. we did not measure ccl- <dig>  which is another ligand for ccr <dig> and could be related to hsv- <dig> infection. we did not evaluate natural killer cells as well. these cells may be relevant for the control of viral infection as they are putative effectors in the response against virus. also, future experiments for the evaluation of viral titers and chemokine levels each day after infection are warranted. there is a possibility that compensatory mechanisms could eventually impact the immune-associated phenotype of ccr5-/- mice. nevertheless, no differences between non-infected wt and knock out mice were observed in the parameters assessed.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study suggests that the absence of ccr <dig> is associated with an enhanced immune response against hsv- <dig>  reducing cns viral burden. however, the death rate is unchanged probably as a result of excessive inflammatory response. future studies are necessary to further investigate the fining tune of the immune response in hsv- <dig> infection and, hence, to try to solve the puzzle involving both protection and lesion in the cns.
