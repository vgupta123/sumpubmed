BACKGROUND
the zebrafish has many advantages for use in immunological research. zebrafish can mount innate and adaptive immune responses much like higher vertebrates and their genome demonstrates a high degree of synteny to the human genome  <cit> . current methods for targeted gene silencing, the availability of many mutant strains and the ease of producing specific mutants make the zebrafish an excellent model for experimental immunology  <cit> . they are phylogenetically one of the lowest vertebrates and rely more than mammals on innate immune mechanisms, and may prove to be one of the best models for innate immunology. however, the development, propagation and characterization of mutant and/or knock out zebrafish are critical to help define immune cell and immune gene functions in the zebrafish model. much of the research on inducible components of innate and acquired immunity is based on in vitro research utilizing isolated or cultured cells. these types of studies are useful for dissecting specific mechanistic pathways but are artificial, in that unknown cellular interactions that occur in the whole animal are removed from the system. with the production of mutants and specific knock out mice, components of the immune system could be dissected in the whole animal model. the use of scid and rag  <dig> and  <dig> mutant mice has allowed the investigation of the specific contribution of innate defenses in many infectious diseases. both mutants have normally functioning macrophages, natural killer cells and neutrophils, but lack t and b lymphocytes  <cit> .

similar mutants are now being used in biomedical and fish immunology related research. reverse genetics, the ability to inactivate a given gene in an entire animal, is an established technique in zebrafish research  <cit> . target-selected mutagenesis was used to identify a series of  <dig> rag <dig> mutations. one of these was a point mutation that causes a premature stop codon in the catalytic domain of rag <dig>  <cit> . a functional rag <dig> protein is required for vj recombination when generating functional immunoglobulin and t cell receptor  genes  <cit> . as in other vertebrates, there is only one functional rag <dig> gene; loss of function at this locus results in a complete block of immunoglobulin gene assembly and, presumably, in immunodeficiency  <cit> . the aims of our project were to describe leukocyte cell populations of adult rag1-/-  and rag1+/+  zebrafish by morphologic and flow cytometric analyses, and to determine the presence or absence of leukocyte-associated transcripts by rt-pcr assays.

RESULTS
differential leukocyte counts
zebrafish non-erythroid peripheral blood cells included thrombocytes, monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells. thrombocytes had round nuclei and very scant, faintly eosinophilic cytoplasm that was often irregular. the nuclear chromatin was very dense. lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells included several populations that were round with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. the cytoplasm stained pale blue and was agranular. smaller lymphocytes had a very scant cytoplasm. larger lymphocytes had a more granular cytoplasm. monocytes were large with a lower nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. nuclear shape was round, indented or bilobed, and the cytoplasm was granular, but not frothy. macrophages were large with a low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. the nucleus was irregularly shaped. the cytoplasm was frothy, or vacuolated, and often contained debris, and the margin was often irregular. the granulocyte population was predominately two cell types: a myeloperoxidase  positive neutrophil and an mpo negative eosinophil. the nuclei of neutrophils were multi-lobed and the cytoplasm stained lilac or pale pink and was not obviously granular by light microscopy. eosinophils had eccentric nuclei. the cytoplasm stained pale pink and contained larger granules.

comparisons of pbl differentials from mutants and wild-types were  <dig> % vs.  <dig> % lymphocyte-like cells and lymphocytes,  <dig> % vs.  <dig> % monocytes, and  <dig> % vs.  <dig> % granulocytes . mutant lymphocyte-like cell populations were significantly less than wild-type lymphocyte/lymphocyte-like cell populations, and granulocyte populations were significantly greater compared to wild-types. average thrombocyte counts  were  <dig> ±  <dig>  for mutants and  <dig> ±  <dig>  for wild-types. comparisons of kidney hematopoietic tissue leukocyte differentials from mutants and wild-types were 8% lymphocyte-like cells vs.  <dig> % lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells, 57% vs.  <dig> % myelomonocytes,  <dig> % vs.  <dig> % precursors and  <dig> % vs.  <dig> % thrombocytes . again, mutant lymphocyte-like cell populations were significantly lower than wild-types, and myelomonocyte populations were significantly greater than in wild-types. cell counts are presented as percentage ± standard deviation.

flow cytometry
examination of mutant and wild-type kidney interstitial cells by fluoresence activated cell sorter  analysis demonstrated three main cell populations . on the basis of forward scatter  and side scatter  properties and location in a fsc vs. ssc plot, these populations were identified as monocytes/granulocytes/myelomonocyte precursors and designated a, hematopoietic precursors designated b, and lymphocytes/lymphocyte-like cells designated c. the fsc threshold was set to exclude erythrocytes. dioc <dig> and dioc <dig> staining did not discriminate the zebrafish thrombocyte population from the small lymphocyte population. however, differential counts of kidney hematopoietic tissue indicated thrombocytes were present at less than 1% in this tissue, so discriminating thrombocytes was not necessary. the number of cells with the characteristics of small lymphocytes was significantly reduced in mutant tissue: 7% of gated cells comprised the lymphocyte-like cell population in mutants whereas wild-types had a 26% lymphocyte/lymphocyte-like cell population. we also observed an increased population of monocytes/granulocytes/myelomonocytes in mutants  over wild-types  of the gated cells.

rt-pcr analyses of mutant and wild-type zebrafish kidney hematopoietic tissues
to determine if kidney hematopoietic tissue included functional b cells, we evaluated mutants for expression of immunoglobulin  transcripts with heavy-chain gene rearrangements . when evaluated using nested rt-pcr, the expected products  were obtained for all vh gene rearrangements in the wild-types but no products were obtained from mutants . tcr genes in zebrafish also undergo vj recombination  <cit> . to test for functional t cells we evaluated mutant and wild-type rna for expression of tcr β rearrangements using nested rt-pcr and found expression for these rearrangements in wild-types but no expression in mutants . these data indicate that mutant kidney hematopoietic tissue lacks functional t and b cells.

we also evaluated kidney hematopoietic tissue for the expression of mrna encoding nccrp- <dig> and  <dig> forms of nk lysin using rt-pcr. all rt-pcr assays demonstrated similar amounts of product for mrnas encoding these nk and ncc specific proteins in mutants and wild-types .

discussion
mutant zebrafish had significantly reduced lymphocyte/lymphocyte-like cell populations and significantly increased granulocyte populations. hematological findings of the wild-type fish are comparable with published values for zebrafish  <cit> . published peripheral blood differential results from zebrafish  <cit>  reported 81% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes and 11% granulocytes, and these were comparable to the values we observed: 71% lymphocytes, 11% monocytes and 18% granulocytes. zebrafish granulopoiesis and myelopoiesis have been well described  <cit> . the morphologic and functional characterization of macrophages and neutrophils  have been further described  <cit> . although leukocyte cell counts were significantly different between mutants and wild-types, cell morphologies and staining characteristics were comparable with each other, and other published data referred to above. the thrombocyte populations in mutant and wild-type peripheral blood were statistically the same. zebrafish thrombocytes have been reported to not be readily distinguishable from lymphocytes  <cit> , but a clear distinction could be made in our study, and was also observed in another study  <cit> .

kidney hematopoietic tissue was used for flow cytometry, so there was a greater hematopoietic precursor cell population than would be found in peripheral blood. gate values and cell populations agreed with published flow cytometry data  <cit> . flow cytometry findings corroborate the leukocyte differential counts that demonstrated a significantly reduced lymphocyte/lymphocyte-like cell population in the mutants. flow cytometric quantifications of brown trout and rainbow trout peripheral blood identified three cell populations that consisted of erythrocytes, lymphocytes plus thrombocytes and neutrophils  <cit> . dioc <dig> enhanced side scatter characteristics of carp thrombocytes separated them from lymphocytes  <cit> , and dioc <dig> and dioc <dig> were also used to separate avian cell populations  <cit> . initial trials with dioc <dig> were not conclusive in zebrafish. fortunately, thrombocyte percentages from mutant and wild-type kidney tissues were < 1%, so we did not need to correct for this cell type in our flow cytometry analyses.

hematopoiesis in zebrafish includes myelopoiesis that forms the myelomonocyte precursor that further differentiates into two myeloid lineages, granulocytes and monocytes  <cit> . the granulocytes further differentiate into heterophils and eosinophils  <cit> . the cell populations we identified appeared to directly correlate with the four main cell populations identified by traver  <cit> : erythrocytes, lymphocytes, precursors, and myelomonocytes. in flow cytometric analyses of zebrafish peripheral blood, thrombocytes are included in the small lymphocyte fraction. however, as previously stated, we utilized kidney tissue for flow cytometry, and thrombocytes were rarely found in kidney tissue.

the presence of mrna encoding ig heavy chain genes and tcr β-chain in wild-type kidney hematopoietic tissue and a lack of their expression in this tissue in mutants indicate that functional t-cells and b-cells are lacking in mutants. wienholds et al  <cit>  demonstrated a lack of ig vj recombination using pcr on genomic dna, but did not evaluate gene expression or tcr gene expression. the rt-pcr findings evaluating transcripts encoding nccrp- <dig> and nk lysins suggest that nk-like and ncc cells are present in mutant and wild-type kidney hematopoietic tissue, and these cells likely account for much of the lymphocyte-like cell population observed in the flow cytometry findings. fish possess both nk-like cells, and nccs  <cit> . zebrafish mutants lacking rag <dig> expression demonstrated a marked reduction or absence of lymphoblasts in the thymus  <cit> , and an increased susceptibility to mycobacterium marinum  <cit> . rag <dig> mutant mice also lack functional t and b cells  <cit> , while rag  <dig> mutant mice have functional nk cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
rag1t <dig> mutant zebrafish provide a unique model for investigating innate immune responses because fully functional innate defenses are present without the influence of lymphocytes and presumably lymphocyte associated acquired immune responses. macrophages are present, as are lymphocyte-like cells, and a significantly expanded granulocyte population. the rag  <dig> mutant zebrafish provide the model to elucidate mechanisms of the innate immune system and developmental immunology in fish. wild-types and mutants were utilized in mycobacterium marinum pathogenesis studies  <cit> . additionally, rag <dig> has been shown to be expressed in zebrafish olfactory neurons and rag <dig> negative zebrafish mutants have been used to evaluate the role of rag <dig> in olfactory neuron functions  <cit> . future research will provide new tools to direct the level and type of fish immune defenses against pathogens, and rag <dig> mutant zebrafish provide the platform to investigate specific roles of nk-like cells, nccs, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils in fish immune responses.
