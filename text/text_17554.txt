BACKGROUND
il- <dig> is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the il-12p <dig> subunit and the recently discovered il-23p <dig> subunit, related to il-12p <dig>  <cit> . the il- <dig> receptor complex is present on the surface of apc, nk and activated t cells. despite il-23p <dig> expression in different tissues and cell types, p <dig> alone has not been found to have biological activity and appears to be functional only when dimerized with p <dig>  which occurs in activated mφ and dc. production of il- <dig> by apc is triggered by host immune stimuli as interferons and by bacterial products, such as lps, that signal through tlr  <cit> . whereas il- <dig> drives the differentiation of t helper  <dig> cells , il- <dig> favors the development of a t cells subset with a unique expression profile, characterized by prominent production of il- <dig>  therefore referred to as th <dig> cells  <cit> . il- <dig>  in turn, induces pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to protective response during infection  <cit> . il- <dig> is commonly believed to act on memory cd4+ t cells, enhancing the expansion of committed th <dig> and production of il- <dig>  <cit> , although it was also hypothesized that il- <dig> role is not merely limited to a survival factor. in fact, several observations suggest that il- <dig> may act earlier during th <dig> commitment, promoting their effector function  <cit> . however, il- <dig> is absolutely required for providing th <dig> a pathogenic phenotype, because in its absence these cells may have regulatory functions. nonetheless, the il-23/il- <dig> axis is evolutionarily conserved as it provides a rapid response to catastrophic injuries, caused by certain infective agents  especially in gut, lung and skin.

although autoimmune diseases have long been considered being t cell-mediated, the pleiotropic role of mφ in immunity has lately received more attention, and mφ products have been implicated in various autoimmune pathologies. in particular, it is now demonstrated that mφ-secreted il- <dig>  and consequently t cell-derived il- <dig>  are linked to disease in animal models of autoimmunity  <cit> . abnormal il- <dig> concentration is found also in human biological fluids and tissues affected by rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit> , psoriasis  <cit> , inflammatory bowel diseases  <cit> . moreover, the il-23/il- <dig> axis plays a role during inflammatory process-derived tumor development: il- <dig> decreases number and activity of cytotoxic t cells in transformed tissues  <cit> .

gc hormones modulate a wide array of physiologic functions, especially in the context of immune homeostasis. therefore, synthetic gc are broadly employed for treatment of inflammatory conditions. suppression of inflammation by gc is believed to occur through three main mechanisms: non-genomic pathways, direct genomic effects and indirect genomic effects  <cit> . ligand-bound gr regulates target genes expression by interaction with gre. however, genes regulated through this direct interaction are much less  than genes whose expression is indirectly regulated. in fact, the gr is able to influence - mainly inhibit - the activity of several pro-inflammatory transcription factors, including nf-κb, ap- <dig>  t-bet, stat <dig>  <cit> : in the promoter environment of pro-inflammatory genes, active gr competes for binding to co-activators, affects rna polymerase ii activity, interacts with co-repressors and hystone de-acetylases, specifically modulating the expression of each gene. besides affecting transcription, gc reduce post-transcriptional stability of particular sets of mrna, thus dampening the synthesis of inflammatory proteins after the inflammation has been activated  <cit> . the synthetic gc analog dex has higher affinity for the receptor, higher anti-inflammatory activity and a longer biological half-life than conventional steroids  <cit> . as for the effects of dex on il- <dig> signaling, it is demonstrated that the gc analogue affects activation of stat <dig> induced by il- <dig> in pha/il- <dig> t cells  <cit> , and a study by ma et al. shows that dex inhibits lps-induced il-12p <dig> production in human monocytes  <cit> .

given the critical role of deregulated il- <dig> production in pathogenesis, we investigated in vitro the effect that dex exerts on expression of il- <dig> - in particular, of its unique p <dig> subunit - by human mφ. moreover, since nf-κb and p <dig> mapk are involved in the regulation of il-23p <dig> expression in various cell types of the monocyte/mφ lineage  <cit> , we focused on the mechanism of dex inhibition on these pathways with respect to down-modulation of il-23p <dig> 

RESULTS
dex reduces il- <dig> levels in vitro
primary cultured human mφ were first subjected to stimulation with lps in order to assess the time course of il- <dig> expression in response to the engagement of tlr- <dig>  although distinct subjects respond diversely in terms of fold induction, they all show a peak level of il-23p <dig> mrna after 8h of persistent stimulation with lps , which is followed by increase of the protein between 8h  and 24h  . therefore, we consider cultured mφ persistently stimulated with lps for 8h a suitable in vitro model of established il- <dig> expression.

the ability of dex to restrain ongoing il- <dig> expression was next evaluated adding the drug during the last 2h of lps treatment: mφ stimulated 6h with lps were either left untreated or treated with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> μm dex, and maintained at 37°c for additional 2h in the presence of lps. relative quantification by rt-pcr revealed that, while dex  <dig>  μm does not exert any effect on il-23p <dig> expression, dex  <dig>  μm induces a significant decrease in the amount of p <dig> mrna compared to dex-untreated samples . a similar reduction occurs with  <dig>  and  <dig> μm dex. on the same samples, the expression of other il subunits strictly related to il-23p <dig> was evaluated and compared by relative quantification, demonstrating that  <dig>  μm is the least dex concentration able to significantly down-regulate il-12p <dig> and il-12p <dig> mrna . on the other hand, a consistent up-regulation of fkbp <dig> mrna was observed with doses ≥  <dig>  μm, demonstrating the effective activation of the gr signaling pathway .

we then attempted at validating il- <dig> expression data also on the protein product, by an il- <dig> elisa on mφ supernatants collected at  <dig>   <dig> and 24h of lps stimulation, either treated or not with dex. unfortunately, the amount of protein was below the limit of sensitivity of the kit, and this problem could not be circumvented by concentrating the samples.

however, the effect of dex on il- <dig> protein production was verified at the intracellular level by western immunoblotting of the il-23p <dig> subunit. human mφ were stimulated 6h with lps and then either added with  <dig>  μm dex or left dex-untreated for additional 2h, then all the compounds were removed and total cell lysates were prepared at 24h. as shown in figure  <dig>  dex added during il-23p <dig> gene transcription leads to a significant decrease of the protein product , confirming the data observed at the transcriptional level and suggesting that the drug can be effective in reducing the amount of secreted interleukin. interestingly, dex was also able to prevent il23-p <dig> protein accumulation induced in human mφ by a distinct pro-inflammatory agonist, zymosan from saccharomyces cerevisiae .

dex does not affect nuclear localization or dna-binding of active nf-κb
transcription factor nf-κb can be regulated by various events and at distinct levels of the activation cascade. one such mechanism consists of cytoplasmic sequestration through interaction with a member of the iκb family. immunofluorescence directed to the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb was performed on mφ stimulated 6h with lps and then either added with  <dig>  μm dex or left dex-untreated for additional 2h. as shown in figure 3a , nuclear-cytosolic shuttling of p <dig> is shifted toward nuclei after 8h of lps treatment. however, addition of dex does not produce any significant reduction of the nuclear signal .

consistent with these results, we observed that none of the tested concentrations of dex actually up-regulates iκbα, either as mrna  or as protein, after 8h of lps stimulation , indicating that the lower il-23p <dig> expression is not secondary to cytosolic retention of nf-κb. nonetheless, it could be the consequence of an impaired dna-binding activity of nf-κb, therefore we performed nf-κb emsa on mφ treated as for immunofluorescence . we observed that the dna-binding activity of nf-κb before addition of the drug  is up to twice  that of basal cells ; when il-23p <dig> mrna is on its peak level  nf-κb activation remains indeed high , but is not inhibited by dex  . surprisingly, the amount of iκbα analyzed on the same cellular extracts  reflects the transcriptional activity of nf-κb rather than its inhibition. in fact, after 6h of stimulation  the amount of iκbα is up to five fold that of basal mφ  , it remains high at 8h   and it is almost unaffected by dex  .

dex reduces the transactivation ability of activated nf-κb
to confirm and elucidate the effect of dex on nf-κb, a reporter cell line was employed. mm <dig> cells transfected with the luc coding sequence under nf-κb transcriptional control, were stimulated with lps over a time course of 8h. at 2h luc mrna is at peak level, whereas the maximum of luc activity is observed at 6-7h . since our goal is to evaluate dex activity on pre-existing inflammatory conditions, we stimulated reporter cells 1h with lps to trigger luc expression. afterward, cells were treated with dex  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> μm for one more hour in presence of lps. culture medium was then replaced and cells were left at 37°c for additional 5h . at the end of treatment the luminescent signal is high compared to basal reporter cells, confirming the activation of nf-κb. whereas dex  <dig>  μm has no effect on the reporter activity, a significant reduction of luc signal is detectable with dex ≥  <dig>  μm.

western immunoblotting for p <dig> was performed on nuclear and cytosolic extracts from the same cells, to exclude that the lower level of reporter activity was due actually to cytosolic sequestration of nf-κb. as expected, nuclear nf-κb-p <dig> increases - and the cytosolic decreases - as cells are stimulated with lps, but the dex concentrations tested do not modify the sub-cellular localization of p <dig> to an extent significantly consistent with the reduction of reporter activity . therefore, we conclude that dex reduces the transactivation potential of active nf-κb, because expression of its target gene is down-modulated although the transcription factor remains localized to the nucleus.

dex down-modulates p <dig> mapk activity
because p <dig> mapk usually promotes nf-κb trans-activity, we speculated that the results above described could arise from p <dig> impairment by dex. thus, in lps-stimulated mφ, increasing concentrations of drug were tested on the extent of p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, on that of nf-κb p <dig> phosphorylation on serine residue  <dig> , and on the expression of mapk phosphatase- <dig> , a negative regulator of mapk.

western blotting was performed on the same type of samples employed for analyses of il- <dig> expression. accordingly, the decreased il- <dig> expression is accompanied by a consistent reduction of p <dig> mapk phosphorylation. again,  <dig>  μm dex  promotes a significant dephosphorylation of p <dig> compared to the control sample  and  <dig>  and  <dig> μm dex  yield similar results. interestingly, the phosphorylation of p <dig> was decreased with an apparent dose-trend relationship, consistent with the reduction of p <dig> mapk activity .

mkp- <dig> levels were evaluated by rt-pcr on mφ under the same experimental conditions as above. as expected, lps promotes a five-fold increase of mkp- <dig> mrna compared to basal mφ, and dex administered to the cells during the last 2h of stimulation further enhances mkp- <dig> expression. in particular, consistent with what above described, at least  <dig>  μm dex is needed to raise significantly the amount of mkp- <dig> transcript over the level of the dex-untreated sample, and this induction is maintained by dex  <dig>  and  <dig> μm . furthermore, the involvement of a phosphatase activity in the reduction of nf-κb transactivation potential by dex was demonstrated on mm <dig> cells using the phosphatase inhibitor na3vo <dig>  mm <dig> reporter cells were stimulated 1h with lps and then treated with dex  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> μm, added alone or along with na3vo <dig> for 1h more, in presence of lps. the medium was then replaced and cells were left at 37°c for additional 5h. increasing concentrations of dex promote a significant reduction of the luminescent signal compared to dex-untreated cells, whereas the phosphatase inhibitor counteracts the trend of such dex-mediated decrease, as cells treated with na3vo <dig> maintain a higher signal compared to cells treated with dex alone .

similarly, the link between phosphatase induction and il-23p <dig> down-modulation was assessed in mφ, administering na3vo <dig> along with dex. mφ were stimulated 6h with lps and then either left untreated or treated with dex  <dig>  μm in the presence or absence of na3vo <dig> for additional 2h. rt-pcr revealed that dex produces a decrease of il-23p <dig> consistent with that previously observed, compared to dex-untreated mφ, whereas addition of the na3vo <dig> along with dex impedes such decrease, yielding an amount of transcript significantly more abundant not only than that of dex-treated mφ but also of control  .

discussion
the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of gc are attributed to their ability of down-regulating pro-inflammatory pathways, such as those of mapk, ap- <dig> and nf-κb, and preventing production and/or release of several pro-inflammatory factors by a variety of cell types challenged with different stimuli  <cit> .

during the last decade numerous studies have demonstrated that aberrant expression of il- <dig> and of its downstream partner il- <dig> underlie development and maintenance of autoimmunity. the requirement of il- <dig> for th <dig> cells to acquire a pathogenic phenotype links unquestionably il- <dig> to disease but, to our knowledge, the outcome of dex treatment on the mechanisms of il- <dig> expression is as yet unexplored. many in vitro studies on the effects of dex perform either a drug treatment -spanning between  <dig> min to 2h- before activation of inflammatory pathways, or a co-treatment with dex and pro-inflammatory agonists  <cit> . instead, we reasoned that the performance of dex could be different if administered after the inflammation has been triggered; therefore, in a therapeutic perspective, we considered more interesting to verify the efficacy of the drug in restraining - rather than preventing - il- <dig> expression under active pro-inflammatory signaling. thus, in our model il-23p <dig> expression is stimulated by lps , then the drug is added during the phase of maximal accumulation of the transcript, before its physiological decay. four logarithms of dex sub-micromolar concentrations  were tested, and the engagement of the gc signaling pathway was verified by the up-regulation of fkbp <dig>  a gr target gene known to be expressed in response to gc as part of the gr auto-regulatory loop  <cit>  .

we show that at least  <dig>  μm dex is necessary to engage gr  and to produce a significant reduction of il-23p <dig> . in fact,  <dig> - <dig>  μm are dex concentrations within the physiologically and therapeutically relevant range for gr-mediated actions  <cit> . however, the results obtained with dex  <dig>  μm are not improved by higher doses, and this may originate from a saturation effect, hypothesis supported by the evidence that a  <dig>  μm plasma concentration of dex is sufficient to saturate more than 80% of the gr  <cit> .

dex  <dig>  μm reduces the expression of il-12p <dig> and il-12p <dig> as well . actually, high level production of functional il- <dig> by human monocytes, mφ and dc requires interferon-γ in addition to microbial stimuli  <cit> . however, this does not exclude that lps alone may trigger il- <dig> expression, though to a lesser extent. in fact, we show that both p <dig> and p <dig> are induced by lps treatment, but p <dig> is expressed at a level two orders of magnitude lower than p <dig>  based on the respective amplification efficiencies. unfortunately, since the amplification efficiency of il-12p <dig> is not comparable with those of p <dig> and p <dig>  we cannot make any statement about its relative abundance. however, from these observations we conclude that a physiologic dose of dex is able to dampen ongoing expression of both il- <dig> subunits, through inhibition of the signaling pathways that govern the transcription triggered by microbial stimuli. moreover, the transcriptional down-modulation of il-23p <dig> is here demonstrated to yield a comparable decrease of the protein amount, leading to the conclusion that dex effectively impairs the ability of producing il- <dig> in human mφ . therefore, we aimed at identifying the main molecular mechanisms at the basis of il- <dig> reduction by dex.

consistent with the typical tlr signaling, we have recently shown that nf-κb activity is required for il- <dig> expression in lps-stimulated human mφ  <cit> . thus, we focused on the nf-κb signaling pathway, which dex inhibits at multiple levels. the transcriptional up-regulation of iκbα has long been known to play a major role in gc-mediated repression of nf-κb, especially in certain cell types  <cit> . our research group have demonstrated that in mφ dex up-regulates iκbα, which prevents nf-κb triggering by lps  <cit> . instead, when dex is added over a pre-existing activation of the pathway, down-modulation of pro-inflammatory transcripts is not accompanied by a consistent cytosolic sequestration of nf-κb . in fact, dex does not affect amount of iκbα neither at the transcription level nor at that of translation . actually, lps up-regulates iκbα, which is already up to four times more abundant than in basal mφ when dex is added to cells ; thus, it is likely that dex is not able to further enhance iκbα expression. nonetheless, such high amount of iκbα seems not to be sufficient or competent for nf-κb inhibition in an environment of persistent tlr signaling. in agreement, when nf-κb activation is explored by emsa , clearly results that dex does not impair transcription factor binding to target dna.

although the relevance of iκbα up-regulation in gc anti-inflammatory action has been questioned  <cit> , our opinion is that it may rather depend on the timing of drug intervention with respect to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. accordingly, we verified on a cell-based reporter system that expression of a nf-κb reporter gene is indeed down-modulated upon addition of dex during lps stimulation , in a fashion that does not imply diminished nuclear distribution of the transcription factor  and hence suggests that nf-κb transactivation ability is decreased.

in synthesis, data from the mm <dig> cells parallel those from mφ in indicating that  <dig>  μm is the least dex concentration, among those tested, effective in tethering nf-κb pro-inflammatory activity triggered by lps. in addition, mφ data demonstrate that  <dig>  μm dex diminishes il- <dig> expression while leaving unaffected nf-κb activity in terms of nuclear localization or dna-binding; rather, data from the mm <dig> reporter system suggest that, in an ongoing inflammatory state, dex acts through reduction of nf-κb trans-activity.

besides nf-κb, p <dig> mapk regulates inflammation through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, and mapk inhibition has been suggested as a promising anti-inflammatory approach  <cit> . indeed, p <dig> mapk-dependent phosphorylation of proteins in the transactivation complex favors nf-κb activity  <cit> . for example, msk <dig> , a downstream target of p <dig> mapk, phosphorylates serine  <dig> of p <dig> enhancing transcription  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> favors inflammation also by post-transcriptional stabilization of pro-inflammatory mrnas that contain adenylate/uridylate-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region  <cit> .

we demonstrate that a decrease of p <dig> mapk phosphorylation takes place in lps-stimulated mφ upon administration of dex ≥  <dig>  μm . ser <dig> phosphorylation on nf-κb-p <dig> normally occurs following activation of p <dig> mapk and erk  <cit> . as expected, the down-modulation of p <dig> mapk is accompanied by a consistent diminution of ser <dig> phosphorylation . although the role of erk has not been explored in this work, these results strongly support the involvement of p <dig> mapk inhibition in the mechanism of dex-induced restraint of nf-κb trans-activity and of pro-inflammatory gene expression.

recent works have focused on the role of map kinase phosphatase  <dig>  in the context of gc anti-inflammatory function. mkp- <dig> is induced by gc, in fact dex raises mkp- <dig> levels in various cell types  <cit> . this phosphatase acts on p <dig>  jnk and erk, thereby terminating their activation. according to the model here depicted, we show a dex-dependent up-regulation of mkp- <dig> , consistent with the decrease of p <dig> and p <dig> phosphorylation. moreover, addition of na3vo <dig>  a phosphatase inhibitor, counteracts the effect of dex on nf-κb transactivation ability, demonstrating that dephosphorylation of substrates is necessary for the accomplishment of dex function . the same mechanism likely applies to the specific expression of endogenous il-23p <dig> in mφ, because the restraint caused by dex  <dig>  μm is completely prevented by na3vo <dig> .

because we demonstrated that dex causes inactivation of p <dig> mapk, and p <dig> favors stability of pro-inflammatory transcripts, we next asked whether the lower amount of il-23p <dig> results exclusively from reduced expression - secondary to reduced nf-κb activity - or is actually due to a combination of both impaired synthesis and enhanced degradation. the decay of il-23p <dig> mrna, in the presence or absence of dex, was analyzed by mrna decay assays with the inhibitor of gene expression actd . in our experimental approach actd is added after  <dig> min from addition of dex, to allow mkp- <dig> up-regulation. unfortunately, due to such particular timing of the assay, we could not conclude whether the rapid  decay in presence of dex can be ascribed also to enhanced post-transcriptional destabilization of p <dig> mrna. a possibility exists that dex is only capable of preventing stabilization of mrna-protein complexes, but not of destabilizing pre-existing stable complexes  <cit> . in light of this, the decreased amount of il-23p <dig> may result from failing stabilization of newly synthesized mrna.

in sum, we show here for the first time that a  <dig>  μm concentration of dex reduces the expression of il- <dig> by restraining nf-κb transactivation ability. we demonstrate that nf-κb trans-activity is reduced by loss of ser <dig> phosphorylation on p <dig>  and that this is sufficient to switch off the expression of an exogenous nf-κb target gene as well as of the endogenous il-23p <dig>  we show that this effect requires a phosphatase activity, suggesting that it is mediated by p <dig> mapk inhibition, achieved through mkp- <dig> induction by dex. from a therapeutic point of view, this latter point is particularly relevant in light of the overexpression of p38α by mφ of the intestinal lamina propria from inflammatory bowel disease patients  <cit> .

while this paper was in preparation, it was shown that expression of il12p <dig> is regulated by a ternary nf-κb complex composed of p <dig>  c-rel and an hypophosphorylated form of iκbβ that stabilizes the transcription factor  <cit> . therefore, it will be intriguing to verify whether iκbβ plays a role in il-23p <dig> expression, and eventually to explore the impact of dex on the phosphorylation status of iκbβ.

CONCLUSIONS
since continuous priming and recruitment of new t cells into the effectors pool underlies chronic autoimmunity and is involved in the relapsing nature of diseases, gains of interest the rationale of il- <dig> neutralization to prevent relapsing-remitting autoimmunities  <cit> . to this regard, the efficacy of dex treatment in vitro is here demonstrated, with interesting implications from a therapeutic perspective.

novel gr ligands that selectively promote transrepression but not transactivation have been proposed to maintain anti-inflammatory effects while causing fewer side effects; however, our findings show that dex-engaged gr induces an anti-inflammatory factor, mkp- <dig>  indeed supporting the opinion that dimerization-deficient gr ligands might not be effective  <cit> , as anti-inflammatory functions of gr are not independent of its dimerization and transactivation activity.
