BACKGROUND
the age-related neurodegenerative diseases prevalence is growing continuously due to a permanent increase in the human life span  <cit> . it affects almost half of all patients with dementia. parkinson's disease  is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, which results in abnormalities in motor function  <cit> . due to the high-frequency of pd, many researchers have tried to find the causation of pd. the disease is clinically characterized by impaired motor function, manifested by resting tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability  <cit> . pd is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra  pars compacta  <cit> .

although the causation of pd is diverse and complex combination of the mitochondrial proteins' dysfunction, genetic variation effects in cell cycles, and environmental risk factors, it is now clear that genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease  <cit> . however, the etiology of sporadic pd, occurring in 95% of the cases  <cit> , is still not fully understood. to solve this problem, several resources have been incorporated to help pd studies such as mdpd  <cit>  and pdgene  <cit> . mdpd provides a unique functionality to compare the differences in the type of mutations among ethnic groups manually examined by biomedical researchers  <cit> . pdgene at the gene prospector application provides evidence about human genes in relation to parkinson's disease and risk factors from association studies  <cit> . although useful integrated pd-related information has focused on genetic mutation and pd-association studies, there remains a limitation in public resource-dependent information. therefore, we constructed experimental resources to investigate a wide spectrum of molecular events prior to integrating the pd-related public resources. because public databases for snps and diseases are large, complicated, and difficult to use, we have developed the pipeline system to provide disease-related genes and genetic variations.

here, we report the pdbase database to capture characteristics of the general pd-related genes and abundantly expressed genes in sn . this database contains experimentally confirmed sn ests annotations and information about genes associated with pd: in detail, genetic variation, differential gene expression, gene-regulating elements, mitochondrial proteins, and pathways associated with pd-related genes. users can explore the pd-related information according to the gene name or by clicking the gene list.

methods and 
RESULTS
substantia nigra  ests collection
we collected the  <dig>  substantia nigra  expressed sequenced tags  from full-length cdna libraries of brain sn normal tissues and pd patients sn tissues using oligo-capping methods in a previous study  <cit> . these sn ests were deposited in no.s dt214917~dt <dig> at the dbest database, ncbi. the full-length cdna library was constructed using an improved capping method with the pcns-d <dig> vector  <cit> . a normalized cdna library was also constructed to obtain genes that are rarely expressed by the previous method  <cit> . we checked the repeat elements using repeatmasker program http://repeatmasker.org. to get high-quality sn ests, we went through several filtering steps: 1) removing the short length ests, 2) removing ests contaminated by genomic dnas and e. coli, and 3) removing ests not aligned in any unigene cluster. we analyzed the pd candidate genes with this ests pool containing  <dig>  sn ests from pd patients and  <dig>  sn ests from normal tissues. we carried out the annotation of sn ests based on unigene clusters and then obtained  <dig>  genes' information with  <dig>  unigene clusters.

sn ests clustering and expression
the annotation of the sn ests was carried out using the human refseq mrna  <cit>  and the unigene database  for similarity comparisons based on the unigene clusters . our sn ests were clustered in  <dig>  unigene clusters and assigned in  <dig>  genes. since we constructed the full-length cdna libraries using the oligo-capping technique  <cit> , these sn ests can be resourced to examine the multiple transcription start sites comparing mrna transcription start sites. to investigate amino acid changes, we compared the sn ests sequences to the refseq protein sequences using blastx  <cit> .

to study the global expression of genes possibly associated with sporadic pd constituting most pd cases  <cit> , we accounted for the number of sn ests from pd patients and normal tissues assigned in same gene. the frequency of each gene was analyzed by dividing the number of ests of a gene by the number of total clones merged into the unigene database build # <dig> in each full-length cdna library. genes that were abundantly expressed were selected and listed among the ests. significant differences in gene expression among the datasets were calculated using the audic and claverie method  <cit> . we analyzed the probability of differential expression between the normal full-length sn library and the pd full-length sn library at a cut-off probability of  <dig>  . finally, we found  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes through the comparison of normal and pd sn ests frequencies. mbp of them was reported to be up-regulated in pd sn  <cit> . the up-regulated genes were associated with structural constituents of the myelin sheath, cytokine activity, transcription regulator activity, gtpase activity, calcium ion binding, or rna binding on molecular function. the down-regulated genes were associated with oxidoreductase activity, serin-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, phosphatidylethanolamine binding, mu-type opioid receptor binding, rho gtpase activator activity, integrin binding, monooxygenase activity, or lipid binding.

genomic mapping of expressed sequence clusters
to create a consensus sequence, we mapped the sn ests, mrnas, and unigene est clusters having at least one mrna to exclude the pseudo genes onto human genome using blat and sim <dig>  we used consensus sequences to eliminate non-consensus features of each unigene cluster, after filtering out est sequencing errors or contamination by a minority of similar but paralogous sequences. then est-mrna alignment was generated using the sim <dig> program, producing a consensus sequence that excludes minority features such as unaligned ends and inserts due to chimeric sequences or unspliced introns. the matching genomic region was aligned with the complete set of ests and mrnas for the unigene cluster using blat  <cit>  and sim <dig>  <cit> . the sn est sequences were aligned in human genomic sequences with a 75% minimum score and 90% minimum identity. when coordinates had non-canonical splice sites, we confirmed the exon-intron junction sites with the sim <dig> program to perform alignments of expressed and genomic dna sequence data efficiently and accurately, allowing for introns in the genomic sequence, and a relatively small number of sequencing errors  <cit> .

alternative splicing analysis of sn ests
alternative splicing was detected by a computational procedure using genomic-est-mrna multiple sequence alignments. alternative splicing types were derived from these isoforms retaining all possible alternative splicing information  <cit> . sn ests with poor coverage were filtered out to remove non-consensus splice sites and regions with poor coverage. we categorized the alternative splicing types such as alternative start, alternative end, alternative 5' exon, alternative 3' exon, exon skipping, mutually excluded exons, or intron retention. alternative starts and ends were identified if the first or last exon in a gene model was part of an alternative region. alternative cassettes were labelled as such if the junction skipped one exon.

pdbase contains transcripts representing several alternative splicing events . sn ests were associated with alternative splicing events in  <dig> genes. to examine candidate genes having the pd-specific alternative splicing patterns, we compared the alternative splicing patterns of normal sn ests and pd patients ests. we found that thirty-five pd-specific candidate genes having alternative splicing events were up-regulated in pd sn tissues: for example, aqp <dig>  dcxr, dkk <dig>  eef1a <dig>  gnas, pgk <dig>  suclg <dig>  and thtpa. the major alternative splicing events in genes up-regulated in pd sn tissues are alternative transcription start or end sites. this may be a reason to construct sn full-length cdna libraries using the oligo-capping method to replaces the cap structure specific to the 5' end of eukaryotic mrna with oligonucleotides  <cit> .

functional annotation
to provide the global pd-related gene features, we integrated pd-related gene information, as well as knowledge-based information. because public databases for snps and diseases are large, complicated, and difficult to use, their integration is challenging. we collected  <dig>  genes associated with pd and average  <dig> genetic variations in genomic region through our pipeline system for the disease-related gene and genetic integration  <cit> . this integrated information is based on human gene nomenclature   <cit>  and uniprot  <cit> , genetic variation from dbsnp   <cit> , and disease information from online mendelian inheritance in man   <cit> , human gene mutation database   <cit> , and the genetic association database   <cit> . we examined the pd-related gene distribution to cover several domains of molecular and cellular biology based on the gene ontology database  <cit> . in addition, we surveyed the protein-protein interaction  of the pd-related genes from the human protein reference database   <cit> . it has been reported that the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of snpc is conducted by dysfunction of the mitochondrial complex through activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic molecular pathways  <cit> . hence, we investigated mitochondrion proteins associated with pd from mitodat   <cit> . we found  <dig> mitochondrial proteins located in inner membrane , outer membrane , inter membrane space , or matrix . the numbers in parentheses indicate the percentages of mitochondrial proteins located in each organelle among the total number of mitochondrial proteins. there are, for example, solute carrier family  <dig> , atp synthase, h+ transporting, mitochondrial f <dig> complex , and kinesin heavy chain member .

we also investigated molecular and cellular signalling pathways associated with pd-related genes from the biocarta models http://www.biocarta.com/genes/index.asp and the kegg databases  <cit> . to examine the rna elements involved in the regulation of pd-related genes, we searched microrna elements related to pd genes from the mirbase database as experimental micro-rna resources  <cit>  and conserved mammalian microrna regulatory target sites for conserved microrna families in the 3'utr regions of refseq genes predicted by targetscans at the ucsc table track  <cit> . in addition, we utilized multiple transcription start sites, cpg island, and repeat elements on the ucsc table tracks .

web interface
the pd database server was developed in java and java server pages connected to mysql. the main web interface allows exploration of integrated pd-related information through an alphabet ordered genes list and through query searching. the user can look at all the pd-related information at once. when the user clicks on a letter of the alphabet, the total pd-related gene list starting with the chosen letter can be seen. the user can then directly obtain results consisting of sn est statistics, targeted gene information , genetic variation , gene regulation , gene distribution on the gene ontology, and network information such as pathways and ppi . when the user submits a gene, the system will return a list of genes related to the query along with gene aliases and types. when selecting a specific gene, pdbase shows the sn est distribution, gene and genetic variants through the genome browser  <cit> , and provides information on network properties of the pdbase through the ppi viewer  <cit> . these genetic variation and gene regulation elements displayed in the genome browser or ppi viewer facilitate the recognition of the disease-causing gene characteristics, especially if the snp or gene regulation factors lie in the promoter region or in an intronic sequence  <cit> .

to show an example of a pd-related gene search, we present query results for a gene, spp <dig>  which is secreted phosphoprotein  <dig> . when a user queries this gene, spp <dig>  comprehensive information including frequency differences between the two full-length libraries from sn pd and normal tissues is seen. there are  <dig> sn pd ests and  <dig> sn normal ests in the pdbase database. the spp <dig> was down-regulated at a statistically significant level in more than one sample having a probability of  <dig>  < p <  <dig> . this gene is known as a high anti-apoptotic gene from a previous cell death activity study  <cit> . in addition, the user can get general gene information and genetic information containing the snp marks located in this gene region, repeat elements, and alternative splicing events from the pd and normal sn ests. three micro-rnas can be associated with regulation of this gene, which has experimentally confirmed protein-protein interaction with eighteen other proteins and belongs to the regulators of the bone mineralization pathway. this spp <dig> gene was represented as a pd target gene through our human sn ests analysis and verified using rt-pcr and neurotoxin, a 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropiridine -treated mice model  <cit> . the query results through the pdbase database are more helpful to researchers than results obtained from published previous databases.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a database of pd-related genes and genetic variation using sn ests, called pdbase. pdbase contains  <dig>  genes and the biological characteristics of these genes in two ways: 1) through  <dig> cdna libraries from human normal and pd's sn tissues and 2) by integrating information on disease-related genes and genetic variation. mitochondrial dna variants in pd play various roles. mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported as the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . thus, pdbase also provides the pd-related mitochondrion proteins, microrna, single nucleotide polymorphisms  markers within pd-related gene structures, repeat elements, and pathways and networks with protein-protein interaction information. pdbase integrates not only public resources, but also un-reported pd target genes discovered from normal and pd sn ests. it can serve as specific biomarkers for pd or neurodegenerative diseases and novel drug development. also, pdbase can provide insight into the pathogenesis of pd and identify molecular targets of potential therapeutic significance for the neurodegeneration.

availability and requirements
pdbase is freely available at http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr/pdbase/. all generated pd-related gene lists can be found at http://diseasome.kobic.re.kr/. the dynamic protein-protein interaction viewer based on java applet technology requires java-enabled web browsers.
