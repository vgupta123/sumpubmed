BACKGROUND
according to the world health organization, an estimated  <dig> million people worldwide are obese  <cit> . such estimates are particularly alarming given the strong association between obesity and various adverse health consequences, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, type  <dig> diabetes and certain types of cancer  <cit> . while the exact causes remain elusive, it is now accepted that obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease that develops from an interaction between the genotype and the environment  <cit> .

a number of genes involved in monogenic, syndromic and polygenic obesity have been identified  <cit> . in addition to genetic predisposition, environmental and behavioral factors resulting in increased physical inactivity and calorie intake also contribute to the development of obesity  <cit> . numerous studies in rodents have attempted to characterize the functions of obesity-related genes and whole-animal responses to high-calorie and high-fat diets  <cit> . such studies have generally shown that the obesity phenotype can differ based on the functions of knockout genes, genetic background, and dietary protocols  <cit> . this suggests the importance of developing and analyzing genetic and diet-induced models of obesity.

although rodent models have greatly contributed to our understanding of human obesity  <cit> , experiments using rodent models require considerable staff and infrastructural support, and are relatively expensive. therefore, the development of simple and inexpensive animal models of obesity to complement the currently used rodent models has been anticipated. recent studies on energy homeostasis in worms, fly and zebrafish have shown that these lower organisms can be used to unravel the metabolic processes underlying obesity  <cit> .

as vertebrates, zebrafish possess many structural similarities with humans that worms and flies do not  <cit>  and have been used to model various human diseases  <cit> . for example, zebrafish digestive organs, adipose tissues , and skeletal muscle are physically arranged in a manner similar to their human counterparts  <cit> . neural and endocrine signals regulating food intake are also conserved in zebrafish, including agouti-related protein   <cit> , leptin  <cit>  and adiponectin  <cit> . although zebrafish larvae have been used in genetic and chemical screening experiments to identify novel genes involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and potential therapeutic targets to treat obesity  <cit> , it remains unclear whether zebrafish can be used as a model for diet-induced obesity , similar to that observed in mammals.

we have developed a zebrafish model for dio and validated the model by several methods, including biochemical and histological analyses, diet therapies and dna microarray analysis of visceral at with comparison to those of mammalian obesity. these studies revealed that dio zebrafish and obese mammals share common pathophysiological pathways, suggesting that zebrafish can be used as an alternative model of dio.

RESULTS
zebrafish overfed with artemia become obese
to develop a zebrafish model of dio, we overfed the fish with freshly hatched nauplii of brine shrimp artemia, a common food source for aquaculture  <cit> . given the hierarchy of macronutrient effects on the perception of hunger , it is plausible that zebrafish would overfeed on artemia and become obese. indeed, increases in the amount of dietary fat are associated with the risk of developing obesity  <cit> .

we first assessed the consumption of artemia by zebrafish. it was previously reported that the energy requirement for a leopard danio, a spotted color morph of zebrafish, is under  <dig> cal  <cit> . therefore, we fed zebrafish at  <dig>  months post-fertilization  with  <dig> or  <dig> mg of freshly hatched artemia to meet their energy requirements  or to overfeed , respectively. zebrafish fed  <dig> or  <dig> mg of artemia per day consumed about  <dig> or 50% of the provided artemia, respectively . because  <dig> mg of artemia contains approximately  <dig> calories, it was estimated that a zebrafish would obtain  <dig> calories from  <dig> mg of artemia at 80% consumption, and  <dig> calories from  <dig> mg of artemia at 50% consumption. zebrafish were fed under these dietary protocols for  <dig> weeks.

as shown in figures 1a and 1b, significant  increases in body mass index , which was calculated by dividing the body weight  by the square of the body length , were evident in male  and female  zebrafish in the of group compared with those in the control group within  <dig> week of the dietary protocol. this trend was maintained throughout the 8-week dietary protocol. as shown in figures 1c and 1d, plasma tg levels were also significantly  higher in male  and female  zebrafish in the of group than in the control group at week  <dig>  but not at week  <dig>  lipid-specific oil red o staining of frozen liver sections revealed abnormalities consistent with hepatosteatosis in both male  and female  zebrafish in the of group at week  <dig>  but not in the control group. these results indicate that zebrafish overfed with artemia develop obesity in a manner similar to those observed in transgenic zebrafish overexpressing agrp  <cit>  and in mammalian models of dio  <cit> .

calorie restriction improved body weight and hypertriglyceridemia
calorie restriction  is the most frequently prescribed treatment for obesity, although the health benefits of cr based on hard endpoints such as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain to be elucidated  <cit> . to validate the effect of cr, we fed the previously of zebrafish with  <dig>  mg of freshly hatched artemia per day  for  <dig> weeks  after the 8-week overfeeding period . the zebrafish consumed almost all of the provided artemia  and the body weight of male and female zebrafish decreased to 84% and 82%, respectively, at of8w . plasma tg levels were significantly  decreased to 69% 52% at of8w in male and female, respectively . these data indicate that cr is effective for the treatment of dio in zebrafish, similar to mammalian dio  <cit> .

gene expression profiling of visceral at revealed common pathways in obesity
it has been reported that visceral at plays an active role in the development of obesity-related complications such as cardiovascular diseases, insulin resistance and cancer  <cit> . therefore, we performed dna microarray analysis using agilent zebrafish dna oligoarrays of visceral at from zebrafish overfed artemia for  <dig>  or  <dig>  weeks, and treated the zebrafish with cr for  <dig> weeks  after  <dig> weeks of overfeeding. the amount of visceral at in the control group was so small that we could not extract total rna. therefore, we compared the genome-wide expression profiles of zebrafish at of1w and of8w to identify genes dysregulated by overfeeding using rank product analysis   <cit> . rankprod analysis identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes as significantly  increased and decreased, respectively, at of8w . to identify the genes ameliorated by cr, we compared the genome-wide expression profiles of of8w and cr2w. among the  <dig> genes dysregulated by overfeeding,  <dig> genes  were significantly  ameliorated by cr .

to compare the gene expression profiles of visceral at of zebrafish and mammalian dio, we downloaded multiple sets of microarray data from the gene expression omnibus  <cit>  . gse <dig> was designed to analyze the differences in epididymal at gene expression in rats fed a high-fat diet with those fed a control diet using affymetrix rat genome arrays  <cit> . gse <dig> was designed to analyze the differences in omental at gene expression in mice fed a high-fat diet with those fed a control diet using custom arrays  <cit> . gse <dig> was designed to analyze the differences in omental at gene expression in obese versus lean human individuals using codelink uniset human bioarrays  <cit> .

we analyzed the microarray data using rankprod and identified genes that were differentially expressed in mammalian obesity. rankprod identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes as being significantly  dysregulated in rat, mouse and human obesity, respectively . we compared these gene lists with the  <dig> genes that were significantly dysregulated in zebrafish dio . one gene  was dysregulated in all three models of mammalian obesity, but was not spotted in the zebrafish microarray. quantitative pcr  analysis of zebrafish fabp1a revealed a positive trend in of8w . fourteen genes were dysregulated in two models of mammalian obesity, while  <dig> genes were dysregulated in zebrafish dio and in one model of mammalian obesity . qpcr analysis confirmed the induction of hpx in of8w compared to of1w .

because the microarray platform differed among these four datasets, it is plausible that the composition of the gene list differs among these four species. therefore, we analyzed the microarray data using gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  to identify gene sets defined based on prior biological knowledge, such as the gene ontology category. gsea can determine whether members of a gene set belonging to a same biological pathway tend to occur toward the top of a given gene list, such as the gene list established from microarray analysis. the gsea revealed that genes related to blood coagulation were significantly dysregulated in zebrafish, rat and mouse dio and in human obesity. genes related to platelet activation, fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol efflux, and triglyceride metabolism were significantly dysregulated in zebrafish, rat and mouse dio .

nes: normalized enrichment score; mc: median change in gene expression in the gene set

we also performed sub-network enriched analysis   <cit>  to identify key molecules regulating the expression of the genes in the coagulation cascade or lipid metabolism identified by gsea. snea revealed apolipoprotein h , interleukin- <dig>  and interleukin-1β  as regulatory molecules in the coagulation cascade in obese zebrafish, rats, mice and humans . snea also revealed sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig> , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha , nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig> group h member  <dig> , ppar gamma  and leptin  as regulatory molecules involved in lipid metabolism in obese zebrafish, rats, mice and humans .

aregulatory factors are ranked based on the p-value in each dataset.

regulatory factors ranked within the top  <dig> in at least three datasets are shown in this table.

the interactions between these regulatory molecules and their target genes are shown in figure  <dig> for the coagulation cascade and figure  <dig> for lipid metabolism. the color of many genes, including fibrinogen-γ  and factor ii  in figure  <dig> and apolipoprotein a-i  in figure  <dig>  are red, suggesting that genes related to coagulation cascade and lipid metabolism are induced by obesity. by contrast, the color of these genes was turned green by cr, suggesting that cr ameliorates dysfunctions in the coagulation cascade and lipid metabolism . these results suggest that dio zebrafish share common pathophysiological pathways with mammalian obesity.

discussion
in this study, we developed a zebrafish model of dio. dio zebrafish exhibited increased bmi, hypertriglyceridemia and hepatosteatosis. comparative transcriptome analysis using visceral at revealed that the dio zebrafish and obese mammals share common pathophysiological pathways. these findings suggest that the dio zebrafish model can be used to identify putative pharmacological targets and to test novel drugs for the treatment of human obesity.

zebrafish can be used as a useful animal model of dio
the regulation of feeding behavior occurs via close interactions between peripheral regions and the brain  <cit> . peripheral endocrine and metabolic factors convey information regarding nutritional status to the brain. the peripheral signals include satiety signals, such as pyy  <cit> , glp- <dig>  <cit>  and ghrelin  <cit> , which originate from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as adiposity signals, such as adiponectin  <cit>  and insulin  <cit> , the blood levels of which are proportional to body nutrient stores  <cit> . the brain then processes this peripheral information and induces neuropeptide signaling , mainly from the hypothalamus, to stimulate or inhibit feeding. these peripheral and central factors controlling food intake are well conserved in zebrafish  <cit> .

probably because of the low satiating effect of fat consumption  <cit> , high dietary fat intake is associated with an increased risk of obesity  <cit> . because of the relatively high fat content in artemia, as compared with flake foods, we fed the zebrafish a diet consisting solely of artemia to induce obesity. we have demonstrated that zebrafish overfed with artemia showed significant increases in bmi and plasma tg levels and hepatosteatosis, consistent with obesity observed in humans and rodent models of dio  <cit> . of note, there seemed to be no decrease in physical activity in the zebrafish overfed artemia , indicating that the development of obesity is most likely to be a result of the increased intake of a high-fat diet.

there are several advantages to the dio zebrafish model. first, zebrafish  respond well to the artemia diet because almost all of the zebrafish overfed artemia developed obesity. the c57bl/6j  line has been widely used for dio in mice because these mice are very susceptible to obesity when fed a high-fat diet  <cit> . however, there are variations in adiposity among individual b <dig> mice  <cit> . similarly, when outbred sprague-dawley rats are fed a high-fat diet, about half become obese, while the other half are resistant to dio  <cit> . the relatively homogenous responses of zebrafish to overfeeding with artemia suggest that these fish represent an excellent alternative model species for experimental research on dio. furthermore, the dietary protocol to induce obesity in zebrafish is simple and can be applied to other zebrafish lines. for example, we are currently applying the protocol to the casper line, which have transparent abdomens, even in the adult stage  <cit> . using dio casper zebrafish, visceral at can be visualized in a living animal under a fluorescent microscope by staining the at with a fluorescent dye, such as nile red  <cit> . this feature makes it possible to monitor the short- and long-term effects of a therapeutic intervention on the amount of visceral at in live dio zebrafish. finally, zebrafish are small and easy to maintain in large stocks because of their high fecundity, thus making zebrafish amenable for medium-to-high throughput screening for early drug discovery  <cit> .

one limitation of the zebrafish dio model is the apparent absence of brown at  <cit> . the development of obesity in mammals not only depends on the balance between food intake and calorie utilization, but also on the balance between white at and brown at  <cit> . therefore, zebrafish dio may not be suitable to identify signaling pathways related to brown at.

comparative transcriptomics of visceral at revealed common pathophysiological pathways in zebrafish and mammalian obesity
genome-wide expression assays using dna microarrays allow rapid screening and quantification of differences in large groups of functionally related genes and are thus well-suited to studies of pathways dysregulated in obesity  <cit> . we compared the visceral at expression profiles of zebrafish, rat, mouse and human obesity. the comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that several genes involved in blood coagulation, platelet activation, fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol efflux, and triglyceride metabolism were dysregulated in both zebrafish and mammalian obesity. il- <dig>  il-1β and apoh were identified as regulatory factors involved in blood coagulation and platelet activation in zebrafish and mammalian obesity. similarly, srebp <dig>  pparα/γ, nr3h <dig> and lep were identified as common regulatory factors for fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol efflux and triglyceride metabolism in zebrafish and mammalian obesity.

visceral at dysfunction can play a causal role in the prothrombotic state observed in obesity by affecting hemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis  <cit> . it has also been shown that il- <dig> and il-1β, secreted from visceral at, induce the biosynthesis of fibrinogen from visceral at and liver. fibrinogen is a substrate of f <dig>  in the final step of the coagulation cascade, and its presence is essential for platelet aggregation  <cit> . of interest, plasma fibrinogen levels were found to be significantly higher in obese subjects than in age- and sex-matched non-obese individuals  <cit> . significant correlations have been reported between fibrinogen and bmi and the waist-to-hip ratio  <cit> . it has also been reported that substantial weight loss reduces fibrinogen levels more effectively than modest weight reduction  <cit> . consistent with these reports, of and cr significantly induced and reduced, respectively, the expression of fibrinogen in zebrafish . apoh binds to activated protein c , an anticoagulant enzyme that is activated by activation of the protein c zymogen by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on the surface of endothelial cells, platelets and monocytes  <cit> . however, the effect of apoh binding to apc is inconclusive and the functional role of apoh in obesity remains to be elucidated.

dyslipidemia is commonly seen in obesity  <cit>  and is characterized by an increased flux of free fatty acids, elevated tg levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased low-density lipoprotein levels  <cit> . fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol efflux and triglyceride metabolism are closely related to these pathways. this study revealed that srebp <dig>  pparα/γ, nr3h <dig> and lep are key regulatory factors in these pathways and are expressed in zebrafish and mammalian obesity. ppars mediate adaptive metabolic responses to increased systemic lipid availability and are activated by endogenous or dietary lipids  <cit> . pparα promotes lipid clearance by increasing tissue fat oxidization  <cit>  while pparγ promotes lipid storage in white at, as well as preadipocyte differentiation to mature adipocytes  <cit> . srebp <dig> is an important transcription factor that regulates the transcription of many lipid genes and participates in adipocyte differentiation by stimulating pparγ  <cit> . nr3h <dig>  also known as liver x receptor a , has been shown to regulate lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis  <cit> . lep, an adiposity hormone produced by white at, reflects total fat mass  <cit> . although we did not detect a statistically significant difference between of8w and of1w in terms of the mrna expression level of lep measured by qpcr , the expression of apoa <dig>  a transcriptional target gene of leptin  <cit> , was significantly induced and reduced by of and cr, respectively  , suggesting that leptin protein levels were likely to be increased in zebrafish dio. it is noteworthy that the functional importance of srebp <dig>  pparα/γ, nr3h <dig> and lep in obesity has been shown in many genetic studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here, we have shown that the dio zebrafish model shares common pathophysiological pathways with mammalian obesity and can be used to identify putative pharmacological targets of human obesity. for example, we are currently performing genome-wide expression profiling of the dio zebrafish liver. the zebrafish model can also be used to study the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the main link between the central nervous and the endocrine system  <cit> . further studies are needed to examine whether complications related to obesity such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases and cancer can be studied in dio zebrafish.
