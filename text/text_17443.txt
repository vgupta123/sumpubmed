BACKGROUND
boophilus spp.  spp.) ticks are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world with range expansion for some species due to changes in climatic conditions  <cit> . infestations with the cattle tick, boophilus microplus, economically impact cattle production by reducing weight gain and milk production, and by transmitting pathogens that cause babesiosis  and anaplasmosis   <cit> . b. annulatus is present in regions of asia, latin america and africa  <cit>  where it may also affect cattle production and vector pathogens.

acaricide application constitutes a major component of integrated tick control strategies  <cit> . however, use of acaricides has had limited efficacy in reducing tick infestations and is often accompanied by serious drawbacks, including the selection of acaricide-resistant ticks, environmental contamination and contamination of milk and meat products with drug residues  <cit> . all of these issues reinforce the need for alternative approaches to control tick infestations such as the use of hosts with natural resistance to ticks, pheromone-impregnated decoys for attracting and killing ticks, biological control agents and vaccines  <cit> .

in the early 1990s, vaccines were developed that induced immunological protection of vertebrate hosts against tick infestations. these vaccines contained the recombinant b. microplus bm <dig> gut antigen  <cit> . two vaccines using recombinant bm <dig> were subsequently registered in latin american countries  and australia  during 1993– <dig>  <cit> . these vaccines reduce the number of engorging female ticks, their weight and reproductive capacity. thus the greatest vaccine effect was the reduction of larval infestations in subsequent generations. vaccine controlled field trials in combination with acaricide treatments demonstrated that an integrated approach resulted in control of tick infestations while reducing the use of acaricides  <cit> . these trials demonstrated that control of ticks by vaccination has the advantages of being cost-effective, reducing environmental contamination and preventing the selection of drug resistant ticks that result from repeated acaricide application. in addition, these vaccines may also prevent or reduce transmission of pathogens by reducing tick populations and/or affecting tick vectorial capacity  <cit> .

controlled immunization trials have shown that b. microplus bm86-containing vaccines also protect against related tick species, b. annulatus and b. decoloratus  <cit> . however, b. microplus strain-to-strain variations in the susceptibility to bm <dig> vaccination have been reported and the efficacy of the bm <dig> vaccine is higher against b. annulatus than against b. microplus strains  <cit> . these results suggested that bm <dig> sequence and/or tick physiological differences may influence the efficacy of the vaccine in boophilus spp.  <cit> .

recently, the gene coding for b. annulatus bm <dig> ortholog, ba <dig>  was cloned from an israeli tick strain and the recombinant protein was secreted and purified from pichia pastoris  <cit> . the bm <dig> and ba <dig> proteins showed over 90% similarity and immune cross-reactivity  <cit> . however, only cattle vaccination and tick infestation experiments could evaluate the efficacy of ba <dig> against b. annulatus and b. microplus infestations and address the question of whether differences in the susceptibility to bm <dig> vaccines between these tick species are due to sequence polymorphisms, physiological characteristics of the ticks or both.

in the experiments reported herein cattle were vaccinated with the recombinant bm <dig> and ba <dig> antigens and infested with b. annulatus and b. microplus to  evaluate the efficacy of recombinant ba <dig> for the control of b. annulatus and b. microplus infestations and  to provide evidence of whether sequence polymorphisms, tick physiological differences or both may account for differences in the efficacy of bm <dig> vaccines against boophilus spp. infestations.

RESULTS
the vaccination with recombinant ba <dig> and bm <dig> protected cattle against b. annulatus and b. microplus infestations
this is the first report on the protective capacity of recombinant ba <dig> for the control of cattle tick infestations. to evaluate the protective capacity of ba <dig> against b. microplus and b. annulatus infestations, cattle were vaccinated with the recombinant protein and compared to cattle vaccinated with two bm <dig> preparations and adjuvant/saline control. the vaccinated animals but not the controls developed antibodies against recombinant proteins . the antibody titers were similar for all groups when measured against ba <dig> and bm <dig> antigens, thus reflecting the presence of common antigenic epitopes between both proteins . the antibody titers in cattle vaccinated with ba <dig> and bm <dig>  were similar and higher than those in animals vaccinated with bm <dig>  . as in previous experiments  <cit> , except for animals vaccinated with bm <dig> , antibody titers increased after successive vaccinations and reached a peak two weeks after the third vaccination shot. the differences in the antibody response elicited by bm <dig>  and bm <dig>  antigens could be attributed to differences in vaccine preparations  and bm <dig>  antigens were determined by elisa in cattle vaccinated with bm <dig> , bm <dig> , ba <dig>  and adjuvant/saline control. antibody titers in immunized cattle were expressed as the od <dig> nm value for the highest serum dilution  and compared between vaccinated and control cattle using an anova test . the time of vaccination shots  and tick infestation are indicated.

the vaccination with recombinant ba <dig> protected cattle against b. microplus and b. annulatus infestations . as in previous experiments with recombinant bm <dig> preparations, tick vaccines decreased the number and weight of adult female ticks, oviposition and egg fertility  <cit> . the efficacy of both ba <dig> and bm <dig> vaccines was higher for b. annulatus than for b. microplus . the efficacy of ba <dig> was higher for b. annulatus  than for b. microplus  while the efficacy of bm <dig>  but not bm <dig>  was higher than that of ba <dig>  on b. microplus. however, the efficacy of bm <dig> vaccines was higher than that of ba <dig> for b. annulatus and similar to previous reports showing close to 100% efficacy of bm <dig> for the control of b. annulatus infestations  <cit> . the efficacy of bm <dig> vaccine preparations against b. microplus was within the range reported in previous experiments with other tick strains  <cit> .

acattle were randomly assigned to experimental groups , vaccinated and challenged with b. microplus and b. annulatus larvae.

bthe percent reduction was calculated with respect to the control group: dt, % reduction in tick infestation; dw, % reduction in tick weight; do, % reduction in oviposition; df, % reduction in egg fertility. in parenthesis are shown the average ± s.e. for adult female tick number, tick weight, oviposition and egg fertility and were compared by student's t-test with unequal variance between vaccinated and control groups. .

cvaccine efficacy  was calculated as  <dig> , where crt, cro and crf are the reduction in the number of adult female ticks, oviposition and egg fertility as compared to the control group, respectively.

polymorphisms in bm <dig> orhtologs and physiological differences between b. annulatus and b. microplus may account for differences in the efficacy of bm <dig> vaccines
the fact that both ba <dig> and bm <dig> vaccines had a higher efficacy for b. annulatus than for b. microplus suggested a tick species-specific effect that resulted in higher susceptibility of b. annulatus to vaccination. this effect may be related to tick physiological processes such as feeding and digestion. for example, a higher amount of blood ingestion or a lesser protease activity in the gut of b. annulatus would result in an increase in the number of antibody-antigen interactions and vaccine efficacy. a direct correlation between antibody titers and vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated for bm86-based vaccines  <cit> . further experiments would have to be conducted to address this important issue by comparing the amount of ingested blood using artificial feeding systems and protease and antibody gut concentration in feeding ticks between different boophilus species and strains.

however, two results suggested that polymorphisms in bm <dig> orthologs may also contribute to differences in vaccine efficacy between b. annulatus and b. microplus:  despite lower antibody titers in vaccinated cattle, vaccine efficacy on b. microplus was higher for bm <dig>  than for bm <dig>  and  the efficacy of bm <dig> vaccines was higher than that of ba <dig> on b. annulatus.

the analysis of bm <dig> protein sequences showed that the antigen in the mexican  strain used for infestation was 97% homologous to the sequence in gavac cuban camcord strain but 93% homologous to the sequence of the mozambique strain . these differences in the sequence of bm <dig> may affect the efficacy of bm <dig> vaccines in different strains  <cit> . for example, two of the predicted antigenic peptides in bm <dig>  were located on a deletion in the bm <dig>  sequence but conserved in the bm <dig>  strain sequence . the efficacy of the ba <dig> vaccine on b. microplus, which was slightly higher  than that of the bm <dig>  vaccine  also supports this hypothesis because the homology to the bm <dig> sequence in the mexican strain used for infestation was also higher for ba <dig>  than for bm <dig> . however, as discussed above, differences in the production of gavac and the mozambique strain vaccines  <cit>  together with cattle physiological factors  <cit>  and antibody isotype composition  <cit>  may also account for differences in vaccine efficacy.

despite the possibility of higher susceptibility of b. annulatus to vaccination discussed above, the analysis of predicted antigenic regions in ba <dig> and bm <dig> also suggested an effect of protein sequence on vaccine efficacy. several predicted antigenic regions were polymorphic between bm <dig> and ba <dig> . furthermore, bm <dig> contained one predicted antigenic region not present in ba <dig>  but present in ba <dig>  . the predicted antigenic regions may contain protective epitopes and thus could be involved in eliciting a protective response after vaccination. therefore, polymorphisms in these regions could explain, at least for some ba <dig> antigens, the higher efficacy of bm <dig> vaccines for the control of b. annulatus.

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported herein demonstrated the efficacy of recombinant ba <dig> for the control of b. annulatus and b. microplus infestations in cattle. these experiments also expanded the results of the efficacy of bm <dig> vaccines by including protection against cattle infestation by new strains of b. anulatus  and b. microplus . finally, these results suggested that physiological differences between b. microplus and b. annulatus and those encoded in the sequence of bm <dig> orthologs may be responsible for the differences in susceptibility of these tick species to bm <dig> vaccines.
