BACKGROUND
the regulation of human gene expression is known to be an extraordinarily complex process, including transcription, mrna processing, mrna transport, mrna stability, mrna translation, protein modification and protein stability. nevertheless, the picture that has emerged over the past two to three decades is one in which the process of transcription itself is a highly regulated process  <cit> , and one could easily believe that the combinatorial interaction of multiple transcription factors within the gene promoter is sufficient to explain this complexity. however, genes with more than one promoter have been known for some time  <cit> , and recent studies using independent lines of evidence have suggested that a large proportion of the human genome is transcribed from both strands  <cit>  and numerous human genes have more than one promoter allowing gene transcription in different cellular conditions  <cit> . as summarized in figure 1a, alternative promoters can take many different forms, producing a wide variety of transcripts and proteins from a single gene locus. moreover, the use of alternative transcription initiation sites also affects the splicing pattern of downstream exons, creating a variety of different transcripts and protein products  <cit> . it is needless to say that these various promoters greatly increase the regulatory control that the cell has over the expression of the gene.

alternative promoters are of particular interest because their aberrant expression has been linked to a number of diseases, particularly cancer. there are a number of experimentally well-characterized multiple promoters for known genes, for example tp <dig>  <cit> , myc  <cit> , cyp19a <dig>  <cit> , brca <dig>  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , mid <dig>  <cit> , ctsb  <cit> , src  <cit> , klk <dig>  <cit>  and tgfb <dig>  <cit> , to name a few. cyp19a <dig> is a well-characterized example that has five known alternative promoters, many of which are separated by more than  <dig> kb and are therefore regulated by completely non-overlapping promoters  <cit> . alternative first exons ex- <dig> , ex- <dig> /ex- <dig> , and ex-1f splice with ex- <dig> to encode the 5' prime untranslated regions  of cyp19a <dig> mrna in the placenta, adipose tissue, and brain, respectively. additionally, in gonads, the transcription starts just  <dig> bp upstream of translation initiation codon in exon- <dig>  the use of alternative non-coding first exons in the cyp19a <dig> transcripts does not alter the protein sequence, as the different 5'utrs splice into a common second exon  that contains the translation initiation codon. it is known that theses various promoters are used in a tissue-dependent manner  <cit> , but the promoter upstream of exon ex- <dig>  is aberrantly expressed in breast cancer tissue, aggravating the disease  <cit> .

many putative gene promoters have been identified either through mapping of expressed sequence tags  to the genome , through sequence conservation studies with other organisms  <cit>  or de novo computational prediction . databases such as mpromdb  <cit>  and h-dbas  <cit>  provide information about well-curated promoters and alternative spliced transcripts identified by aligning completely sequenced and precisely annotated full-length cdnas  <cit> . recently, intensive efforts have been invested in establishing genome-wide profiling methods to identify the regulatory regions, including alternative transcription start sites and the upstream promoter regions in human and mouse genomes  <cit> . currently, three ways were applied for this purpose. one is based on the decreased nucleosome occupancy and increased sensitivity to dnase of the active promoter regions. the two approaches, called dnase-chip and dnase-array, have been created to detect those transcribed promoters and transcripts  <cit> . the second one is called the cap analysis gene expression , combining full-length cdna library with sage technology to screen those 5' parts of transcripts  <cit> . the third one is using chip-chip  to profile the binding position of the rna polymerase ii preinitiation complex  <cit> . the data from these studies provide evidence of large-scale alternative splicing and wide-spread use of alternative promoters throughout the mammalian genomes. most of these methods cannot predict the mrna sequence produced from that promoter, and therefore constructing a traditional cdna microarray to detect their expression is impossible. moreover, two promoters may produce mrna isoforms that are nearly indistinguishable, again making expression microarrays difficult to design. one alternative is to use chip-chip to detect the binding of rna polymerase ii to the genome. although there is evidence that the presence of rna polymerase ii in the promoter does not perfectly correlate with active transcription  <cit> , there does exist a correlation between the two events and therefore rna polymerase ii binding is a good approximation of transcriptional activity  <cit> . here, we have taken an intermediate approach, where we first annotated all possible putative promoters in the human genome by integrative bioinformatics analyses. using these annotations, we designed 60-mer probes complementary to sequences and tiling the core promoter regions  of a subset of genes that have at least two annotated promoters. we tested this array by conducting chip-chip using antibody against rna polymerase ii  in mcf <dig> cells without and with e <dig> treatment. it is well known that estrogen receptor can act both as an activator and repressor of specific target genes, and that these events can then affect cell division and breast cancer progression  <cit> . knowledge about which of the alternative promoters of the er regulated genes are active and inactive in e <dig> treated and untreated conditions in mcf <dig> cells would lead to better understanding of their effects in breast cancer development. several novel putative promoters were found to be active before and after e <dig> treatment. interestingly, we found that in genes with more than one putative promoter, downstream promoters are much more likely to be affected by e <dig> treatment than upstream promoters, suggesting interesting mechanisms of gene regulation in multiple promoter genes.

RESULTS
alternative promoter array
in order to design an alternative promoter array, we first used a bioinformatics approach to annotate all known and putative promoters in the human genome. using evidence from three sources: ucsc known genes  <cit> , firstef  <cit> , and riken cage tags  <cit> , we found evidence for more than  <dig>  transcription start sites separated by  <dig> bases or more in the human genome. we took a gene-centric approach to our microarray design, choosing genes that had two or more known or putative promoters. in the end, about  <dig>  known or putative promoters were selected for our array, covering about  <dig>  genes. the median number of promoters per gene is three .  <dig> mer oligonucleotide probes were designed to tile a region - <dig> to + <dig> surrounding each known and putative transcription start site. because of limitations on probe design, not all regions could be effectively covered but on average the spacing is approximately  <dig> bases from the end of one probe to the beginning of the next.

genome-wide profile of potential promoter usage
in order to identify potential active promoters, we conducted chip-chip with antibody against rna pol ii in mcf- <dig> cell lines with and without e <dig> treatment for  <dig> hours, as described in the methods. the amplified immunoprecipitated dna and input control, after labeling with cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorescent dyes respectively, was used to probe the alternative promoter microarray . each experiment was repeated once to determine the reproducibility of the probe hybridization intensities. after filtering the low quality spots, we performed intensity dependent lowess normalization. the ma plot for normalized data is shown in figure 2b for one control  experiment. we, then, plotted the distribution of the normalized log ratios of red and green intensities. the histogram in figure 2c presents the log ratios for one control experiment, which shows a clear bi-modal distribution. the distribution with mode close to zero represents the probes that are non-responsive and the distribution with mode close to  <dig>  represents the probes of responsive promoters. the expectation maximization  algorithm of khalili et al  <cit>  was modified from the original gamma-normal-gamma fit to a simple gamma-normal fit that appeared to be more appropriate for our data. the algorithm clearly defines two distinct distributions in figure 2c, representing the unbound probes  and the bound probes . see additional file  <dig> for the ma plots and log ratio distribution of data from other experiments. a nice feature of the algorithm is that probes can be assigned to each distribution with a certain probability, allowing us to increase or reduce the stringency of our assignments easily. we defined strong candidates for rna polymerase ii activity as those probes that fell within the green distribution with a p-value of at most  <dig> . however, we also defined a second, weaker condition: those probes that are not significantly part of the larger unbound  distribution at a p-value of  <dig> . this latter group would encompass the "grey area" that lies between the two distributions. the "best" probe from each promoter was used to evaluate the activity of the promoter as a whole. figure 2d shows the proportion of active promoters in mcf <dig> cells at different quality thresholds. at least 65% of the promoters  are inactive in this cell line, whereas ~17% of the promoters have strong evidence for being active. this is roughly in accordance with previous genome-wide studies of promoter activity. for example, kim et al  <cit>  found ~ <dig>  active promoters in imr <dig> cells, which corresponds to ~23% of the unique annotated transcription start sites in the ucsc known genes  <cit> . when we map these promoters back to genes, we find that  <dig>  genes had at least one promoter active in at least on experimental condition, out of a total  <dig>  genes for which we were able to recover data – roughly 50%.

we validated a total of  <dig> promoters,  <dig> promoters that we predicted to be active with high confidence and  <dig> promoters that were predicted to be inactive in mcf <dig> cells. chip-pcr experiments showed that these predictions were for the most part accurate  – seven out of the ten positive targets microarray analysis were confirmed to be bound to rna polymerase ii. similarly, all but one of the negative samples showed no evidence of rna polymerase ii binding. although the binding of rna polymerase ii to the promoter region needn't correlate to gene expression because of posttranscriptional events, we find that a rough correspondence does exist. for example, two promoters in the gene ncoa <dig> were shown to bind to rna polymerase ii with a "low" level of confidence, although in the absence of e <dig> the upstream promoter was predicted to be "strongly off" . these qualitative results were verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  . by comparing these results to the gene eif3s <dig>  whose most upstream promoter was "highly on" in both treatments , we found that the qrt-pcr experiments showed a correspondingly high level of expression of the corresponding gene isoform .

alternative promoters and cpg islands
wang et al.  <cit>  recently noted that the 5'-most promoter of a gene tends to be cpg related, while more downstream promoters are less likely to be. we identified promoters that were active in one or both of our treatments, and classified them as either being associated with the 5'-end of the gene  or downstream promoters . similar to the findings of wang et al., we found that 92% of all 5'-end promoters are associated with a cpg island, whereas only 23% of downstream promoters are.

identification of novel promoters
as shown in table  <dig>  each promoter on the array is supported by different lines of evidence. the most common promoters are those that are supported by multiple cage tags. however, only 14% of the  <dig>  such promoters supported by only cage tags on the array were found to be active at "high" or "medium" confidence levels. of course, it is important to note that a negative result does not necessarily indicate an inaccurate promoter prediction; these promoters may be active in different cell types, or under different environmental conditions. therefore, these numbers should be seen as a lower limit. by far, the greatest concordance was found for cpg-related promoters that are supported by all lines of evidence , of these 68% were found to be active. the data also indicate that the cpg-related promoters that are supported by both cage tags and firstef predictions enjoy a higher rate of success than those promoters that are exclusively supported by either cage tags or firstef predictions. 16% of non-cpg-related promoters in this category were found to be active, while an impressive 39% of cpg-related promoters supported by cage and firstef results were found to be active. in all, if we consider all promoters not supported by knowngenes to be "novel", then out of  <dig>  promoters,  <dig>   were active in at least one treatment. if we eliminate promoters supported only by cage tags, then  <dig> out of  <dig>  promoters  are found to be active. of the ten genes selected for validation in figure  <dig>  eight fall into the novel category  and six of these were confirmed . these surprising results indicate that large numbers of undiscovered, unannotated promoters exist within human genes. notably, we have discovered  <dig> new and active promoters that are situated more than  <dig> bases upstream of the currently-defined 5' end of the gene, suggesting that a significant fraction of the current gene annotations may not be 5'-complete. one of these promoters was upstream of sox <dig>  and was verified to bind to rna polymerase ii . these results also strongly support the recent reports of high frequency of alternative promoter in mammalian genomes  <cit> . in addition, the complicated distribution patterns of these alternative promoters might be easily overlooked by previous expression array analyses.

differential use of multiple promoters with estrogen stimulation
our hypothesis was that treatment with e <dig> affects the promoter activity of a sub-set of genes in the genome. for this analysis, we defined "active" as promoters with "high", "medium" or "low" confidence. for the subset of genes that have single active promoter, we found that  <dig>  promoters were active in both e2- and e2+ treated conditions . whereas only  <dig> promoters were inactivated and  <dig> promoters were activated by e <dig>  this bias towards inactivation is highly significant , indicating that more promoters are inactivated by e <dig> than are activated, which supports the previous report about estrogen-mediated early-down regulated genes  <cit> . some of the genes associated with these promoters have previously been identified as being estrogen sensitive, such as greb <dig>  hspb <dig>  and wfs <dig>  <cit>  . we next considered those genes that have two active alternative promoters and checked for the differential activation or inactivation of the promoters. we found  <dig> genes with both promoters active and not affected by e <dig> treatment . more interesting are the cases where one promoter is affected by e <dig> treatment. the upstream promoters of  <dig> such genes are activated by e <dig> , whereas in  <dig> genes the upstream promoter is inactivated by e <dig>  – a more than 2: <dig> bias in favor of inactivation, which is quite similar to what we found in the single active promoter gene case, and also significant . curiously, this same bias is not present when we examined the downstream promoters, where we found  <dig> were activated by e <dig>  and  <dig> were inactivated by e <dig> .

in terms of the overall differential usage  of alternative promoters due to e <dig> treatment, we found that the downstream promoters are more often affected by e <dig> treatment than the upstream promoter. we found that there were a total of  <dig> downstream promoters affected by e <dig> treatment, while only  <dig> upstream promoters were affected – a significant bias . these intriguing patterns provide some insight into the regulatory control of genes and their isoforms by e <dig>  to investigate this phenomenon further, we examined the locations of active promoters within each gene. as shown in figure 7a, for genes with a single active promoter that is insensitive to e <dig> treatment there is a strong tendency for that promoter to be located at the 5' end of the annotated gene. similar trends are observed in genes with two active promoters that are insensitive to e <dig> treatment, where the upstream promoter is again located near the 5' end of the gene, while the location of the downstream promoter is uniformly distributed throughout the length of the gene . however, a surprising change is observed if one of the promoters is e2-sensitive, where we found that there was a very strong tendency for the downstream promoter to be close to the 3' end of the gene . in keeping with our finding that downstream promoters tend to not be associated with cpg islands , e2-sensitive promoters are overall less likely to be associated with cpg islands than active promoters taken as a whole: 50% of all active promoters are cpg-related, while only 37% of e2-sensitive promoters are .

discussion
although genome tiling arrays are increasingly becoming a viable alternative to focused microarrays, they remain significantly more expensive than focused microarrays, and their signal-to-noise ratio is very high due to the large numbers of inactive probes and lack of probe design considerations  <cit> . another alternative mechanism for studying alternative promoters is the use of traditional expression arrays that have been designed to specifically interrogate particular gene isoforms. unfortunately, in a large number of cases, mrna isoforms are not known for putative promoters, and many isoforms that originate at different promoters differ only in the first exon – a small percentage of the entire molecule, making it difficult to distinguish between the various isoforms. high-throughput sequencing techniques are a recent advance that provide an attractive alternative to microarray-based techniques  <cit> , however there is evidence that chip-chip is more sensitive than chip-sequencing techniques  <cit> .

traditionally, expression analysis was used to define promoter activity. however, one recent report has found that a number of genes experience transcription initiation but show not detectable full-length transcripts  <cit> . nevertheless, additional reports indicate that a correlation does exist between pol ii occupancy and gene activation  <cit> . the findings of guenther et al. may be explained by post-transcriptional regulation, but in any case we believe that the presence of pol ii in the promoter is a good approximation of promoter activity, although further experiments are still necessary to define and characterize this relationship.

here, we have presented a novel  <dig> k microarray that is capable of measuring alternative promoter usage in over  <dig>  putative promoters from nearly  <dig>  genes. this platform is suitable for indirect expression analyses using rna polymerase ii chip-chip as we have shown in this paper, but it is also suitable for methylation based studies using dmh or medip experiments , or for chip-chip experiments using other proteins of interest, such as transcription factors or histone modification signatures. we have demonstrated clear evidence for alternative promoter activities within genes, including the verification of a number of putative promoters. these results suggest that a large fraction of genes in the human genome possess undiscovered promoters and transcription start sites, which agrees with findings based on the mapping of ests to the genome  <cit> , and the mapping of 5' oligo cap cdna libraries to the genome  <cit> .

most intriguingly, we discovered that there is a distinct bias for the downstream promoter in e2-sensitive two-promoter genes to be very close to the 3' end of the gene, whereas no such bias exists in e2-insensitive genes. these promoters are very unlikely to produce a functional transcript of any sort, and we therefore speculate that its purpose is merely to regulate the expression of the transcript initiated at the upstream promoter by "blocking" the progression of the rna polymerase ii complex. this "stalling" mechanism has been observed in other contexts. for example, inhibiting dna replication was recently found to cause rna polymerase ii to stall during the transcription of p <dig>  <cit> . similarly, the cofactor of brca <dig>  is known to cause stalling of the rna polymerase ii complex proximal to the promoter  <cit> . however, we can think of no reason for "blocking" promoters to have a bias towards the 3' end of the gene, since this blocking action could be realized at any point relative to the primary promoter. an alternative possibility is that promoters near the 3' end of the gene are driving expression of an interfering rna, either antisense to the primary transcript or that is capable of inhibiting the formation and progression of the rna polymerase ii complex at the primary promoter  <cit> . such noncoding, interfering rnas are known to regulate expression of the dhfr gene in humans, for example, although in this case the interfering rna is transcribed from a promoter that lies upstream of the primary promoter  <cit> . much more work will need to be performed in the future to identify the regulatory action that these 3'-utr promoters have on their primary transcripts, if any.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated clear evidence of alternative promoter activity for approximately  <dig>  human genes, using a  <dig> k custom microarray that span across  <dig>  putative promoters. our results suggest that a large fraction of genes in the human genome possess undiscovered alternative promoters, which agrees with findings based on the mapping of ests and cage tags to the human genome. we found that a significantly more number of downstream promoters were affected by e <dig> treatment than the upstream promoters. and, there is a distinct bias for the downstream promoter in e2-sensitive two-promoter genes to be very close to the 3' end of the gene, whereas no such bias exists in e2-insensitive genes. the custom microarray can also be used for epigenome analyses, such as methylation based studies using dmh or medip experiments. the present data will help discovery of novel promoters and ongoing annotation of alternative promoters of human genes in different experimental conditions.
