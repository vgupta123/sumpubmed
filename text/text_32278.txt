BACKGROUND
oxyrrhis marina is a basal dinoflagellate taxon that has been extensively studied in both experimental and ecological contexts  <cit>  and increasingly represents a target for studies of dinoflagellate evolution  <cit> . oxyrrhis marina appears to have diverged early in the evolutionary branch leading to the dinoflagellate lineage, close to when the dinoflagellates diverged from the apicomplexans  <cit>  and thus occupies a novel position within the alveolates . the alveolate lineages have each evolved a variety of unusual molecular and genomic features, the development of which has remained unclear in many cases  <cit> . the phylogenetic position of o. marina, as an intermediate lineage between the dinoflagellates and the apicomplexans, and the recognition that it possesses further unusual cytological and genetic features, make it a significant target for the study of evolutionary patterns and genome organisation within the alveolates  <cit> .

despite increasing scientific interest in o. marina, genetic and genomic data for this taxon remain relatively scarce . in part, this is because comparative genomic approaches are limited by the relatively large phylogenetic distances separating o. marina from other genetic/genomic-model protists . more generally, dinoflagellate genomes remain poorly-characterised due to several genomic characteristics. for example, dinoflagellates typically possess large genomes  <cit>  that contain numerous genes arranged in repetitive tandem-arrays  <cit> ; further, they have potentially complex transcriptomes composed of multiple transcript variants for many genes  <cit> . the occurrence of such traits in o. marina remains only partially characterised: the genome appears to be large  <cit> , and a number of genes occur as multiple transcribed variants  <cit> , but whether these genes are present as tandem-arrays has not been demonstrated.

while full genome sequences remain out of reach, next generation sequencing platforms nonetheless provide an efficient strategy to characterise transcriptomes, which can then be used to  quantify genomic features such as novel gene transcripts, alternative splicing, and levels of gene expression; and  uncover the molecular basis of adaptive traits in ecological model-organisms that lack reference genomes  <cit> . thus, high throughput transcriptome sequencing represents a common starting point for large scale sequencing projects for a broad taxonomic range of organisms  <cit> . indeed, several est and transcriptome sequence datasets now exist for dinoflagellate species . additionally, as a result of its broad distribution and abundance in intertidal environments, o. marina is a useful model of the evolutionary and biogeographic processes that determine the distributions of free-living protists  <cit> . the wide distribution of o. marina is undoubtedly associated with an ability to tolerate a range of environments, notably variation in salinity, temperature, and ph  <cit> . beneath this general pattern, however, is evidence for intra-specific variation in physiological tolerances; for example o. marina isolates display differing tolerances to environmental salinity, which potentially correlate with their occurrence in open water compared with intertidal habitats  <cit> . crucially, the molecular basis of differences in physiological tolerances, and hence the mechanisms by which physiological adaptation potentially drives biogeographic patterns, are unknown. identifying genes that respond to key parameters such as salinity stress represents the first step towards indentifying the basis of physiological differences between strains.

in this paper, we present the first 454-based transcriptome sequence data for o. marina, with the aim of  highlighting the occurrence of genomic features such as extensive gene transcript variants, tandemly-arrayed genes, and a gene complement that make it an important target for understanding genome evolution within the dinoflagellates. moreover,  we assess the use of  <dig> read abundance to determine variation in gene expression in response to salinity stress, and thus we examine the potential molecular basis of salinity tolerance in this eurytopic flagellate. in doing so we provide a substantial dataset that increases the publically available dna sequence resources for this highly unusual dinoflagellate species.

methods
cell culturing
to provide rna for cdna synthesis and subsequent  <dig> sequencing, monoclonal cultures of the o. marina isolate 44_ply <dig>  were established in triplicate with media adjusted to  <dig> and  <dig> psu . cultures were grown in modified droop's s <dig> axenic growth medium  <cit>   and were treated with gentamycin  and penicillin/streptomycin solution  to limit bacterial growth; absence of bacteria and fungi was confirmed by culturing small volumes of o. marina cultures in l1p, l1m, and l1pm test media  and by visual inspection of dapi stained culture aliquots using a uv-equipped inverted microscope. cultures were maintained in the dark at 18°c and serially transferred to ensure exponential growth. specific growth rate  was calculated from daily estimates of cell density over  <dig> days . cultures were maintained at  <dig> and  <dig> psu for >  <dig> generations and were harvested when  <dig> l flasks contained ~ <dig>  ×  <dig> cells.

rna extraction and cdna synthesis
cells harvested from triplicate cultures were combined, and total rna was extracted using an rneasy extraction kit  following the manufacturer's standard protocol. rna quantity and integrity was assessed using an agilent bioanalyser picorna assay . cdna template for sequencing was generated using the standard smart cdna synthesis protocol . first strand cdna was synthesised using superscript ii reverse transcriptase from ~ <dig>  μg total rna. sufficient template for sequencing  was generated by long-range pcr; briefly, cdna was amplified in  <dig> μl pcr containing  <dig>  μl first strand cdna as template,  <dig> mm dntps,  <dig> μm smart oligo, ~ <dig> u advantage  <dig> taq polymerase , and the manufacturer's standard pcr buffer; thermal cycling conditions were: 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of . amplified dna was purified using a standard column-based protocol .

 <dig> sequencing and sequence assembly
library construction and pyrosequencing was completed by the centre for genomic research , university of liverpool, uk on a  <dig> gs flx system . libraries created from  <dig> and  <dig> psu salinity treatments were multiplex identified  and then pooled for sequencing using  <dig>  × gs454flx sequencing run. sequencing reads were quality trimmed and adaptor sequences removed prior to assembly. contig assembly was performed using newbler , with overlap settings of  <dig> bp and 99% identity and default values for the remaining parameters. the overall assembly was performed using the combined sequence data for both salinity treatments, and differentially-expressed genes were identified subsequent to annotation.

blast identity searches and sequence annotation
sequence contigs were annotated using a priority blast search strategy  <cit> . briefly, o. marina contigs were compared sequentially against the following databases: uniprot , ncbi nr , pfam , and smart ; identity searches were conducted using blastx  and megablast  implementations of the standalone blast program. initial blast parameters were word size  <dig> ,  <dig>  and an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  after each search the contigs that were not identified at the selected e-value cut-off were queried against the subsequent database . this priority blast procedure was repeated for the remaining unidentified contigs at a less-stringent e-value cut-off . finally, contigs identified by blast  were submitted to blast2go  <cit>  for go category assignment  <cit> .

two additional blastn searches  were conducted between the o. marina rnaseq dataset reported here, an existing genbank o. marina est dataset, and the dinoflagellate est genbank collection. the degree of similarity between o. marina datasets was further explored based on a cap <dig>  <cit>  assembly of the combined datasets .

analysis of expressed gene variants
the occurrence of gene variants/clusters was explored based on a cap <dig> assembly  <cit>  of  <dig> contigs; thus potential clusters/variants were identified as groups of contigs sharing ≥ 90% similarity. for each of the largest clusters indentified in this way, contributing contigs were aligned using seqman  and obvious errors  or mis-alignments edited manually. for cap <dig> contigs that were identifiable and contained open reading frames > 200bp in length, dn/ds ratios were calculated using kaks calculator  <cit> . a further assembly was performed, which included the o. marina ccmp <dig> est dataset. prior to assembly the ccmp <dig> est data were screened for redundancy , which reduced the data from  <dig>   <dig> sequences to  <dig>   <dig>  subsequently, the  <dig> rnaseq and est datasets were assembled at ≥ 90%. transcripts identified as shared between the datasets were subjected to blastx searches against the genbank non-redundant protein database to infer identity.

tandem gene pcr and cloning
for  <dig> candidates the occurrence of a tandem gene organisation was assayed by pcr. outward orientated primers were designed within  <dig> bp of the 3' and 5' ends of contigs. pcrs using phusion polymerase  were conducted using genomic dna as template and  <dig>  pmol of each primer. in all cases pcr amplicon identity was confirmed by capillary sequencing using bigdye v <dig>  chemistry on an ab3130xl genetic analyser. in  <dig> of  <dig> cases, tandem spacer regions generated a mixed sequencing signal indicating the presence of multiple amplicons. for  <dig> candidates , pcr products were cloned using the clonejet blunt end ligation kit  and jm <dig> competent cells . for each gene,  <dig> transformants were sequenced in forward and reverse orientations.

differential transcript abundance
the relative abundances of sequence reads from the  <dig> rnaseq datasets were used to quantify the pattern of gene expression in o. marina exposed to  <dig> and  <dig> psu. the representation of sequence reads from  <dig> and  <dig> psu libraries for each  <dig> contig was normalised for total library size , and statistically significant differences in relative abundance between salinity treatments were assessed using the pairwise audic and claverie, fisher exact and chi-squared tests implemented in the software package ideg <dig>  <cit> . statistical significance was taken at α≤  <dig> , following bonferroni correction implemented by the ideg <dig> software.

gene expression predictions from sequence read abundances were validated by quantitative pcr . pcr primers were designed against  <dig> contigs with a range of read abundances and  <dig> nominal control/housekeeping genes. template for qpcr assays was the same as that used for  <dig> sequencing. assays were performed following the manufacturers protocol in  <dig> μl reactions, containing 2x powersybr green  and  <dig> pmol forward and reverse primer. target and control primer efficiencies were estimated based on serial dilutions of cdna template. all pcrs were performed in triplicate on an ab <dig> quantitative pcr system. relative normalised expression metrics were calculated based on ΔΔct  <cit> . consistency of control gene expression was assessed based on pairwise ΔΔct comparisons between actin, alpha-tubulin, and beta-tubulin.  <dig> target read abundances were normalised to control gene abundance to allow direct comparison between  <dig> and qpcr expression metrics.

RESULTS
sequence output and assembly statistics
sequencing generated  <dig>   <dig> raw reads  from the transcriptome of o. marina isolate 44ply_01; following trimming to remove poor-quality and adaptor sequence,  <dig>   <dig> reads  were available for assembly.  <dig>   <dig> reads could be assembled, generating  <dig>   <dig> contigs, leaving  <dig>   <dig> singletons and  <dig>   <dig> reads that were removed as outliers. median contig length and the mean read number per contig were  <dig> bp and  <dig> , respectively.  <dig>   <dig> contigs were composed of  <dig> or more reads  and varied in length from 97- <dig>   <dig> bp -  <dig> contigs were greater than  <dig> bp long . short contigs  were typically represented by relatively small numbers of reads . however, a small number of short contigs  were highly represented in the sequence output . sequence reads are available via the ncbi sequence read archive . contig assemblies are included with this manuscript as additional file  <dig>  and summaries of the longest and most abundant contigs are included as tables s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively, in additional file  <dig> 

sequence annotation
based on blastx and blastn identity searches against uniprot, ncbi nr, pfam, and smart databases we identified  <dig> % of the o. marina contigs at the more stringent e-value cut-off . a subsequent reduction in stringency  allowed a further 8% of contigs to be assigned a putative function . notably, ~98% of the large  and all of the contigs greater than  <dig>   <dig> bp in length were identified by blast searches , thus the relatively low annotation rate of the dataset stems from an inability to identify relatively short contigs . the overall degree of similarity between the o. marina rnaseq data presented here, an existing est data set for o. marina , and ests for the dinoflagellates as a whole was examined by further blast identity searches between these  <dig> datasets. based on an e value of 1e- <dig> and > 80% similarity the numbers of shared sequences are provided in figure 2; o. marina data sets shared  <dig> contigs/ests , and  <dig> contigs/ests were common to all three datasets.

transcriptome coverage, representation, and gene variants
to examine the relative coverage of transcripts by  <dig> sequencing, the length and aligned position of contigs relative to corresponding full length mrna sequences was examined . for  <dig> contigs, full length mrna sequences were available in genbank for o. marina, or from relatively closely related taxa . in all cases  <dig> contigs were truncated and no spliced leader sequences  <cit>  were detected in the dataset. relative contig length varied between  <dig> and 15% of the full mrna transcript . the most complete identifiable contigs occurred for elongation factor  <dig> and ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit . shorter contigs tended to cluster at the 3' end of mrnas thus an overall 3' bias in coverage occurred .

in addition to single contigs some mrna transcripts were represented as multiple non-overlapping fragments or as variable numbers of substantially overlapping fragments . in the cases where multiple fragments occurred  one contig/fragment was typically highly abundant . manual checking of fragment alignments suggested that overlapping regions contained genuine polymorphisms, though the occurrence of multiple non-overlapping fragments is presumably an artefact of library preparation or sequencing . the second arrangement, multiple highly overlapping contigs, appears to be a genuine biological signal . to assess the prevalence, of these expressed gene variants,  <dig> contigs were further grouped/assembled using cap <dig>  this higher level assembly of contigs generated  <dig> gene clusters consisting of 2- <dig> contigs. in the majority of cases clusters consisted of truncated cdnas bearing 3' utr variants with < 100bp of coding sequence. however, for identified gene clusters, with > 200bp of coding sequence, variation was predominately synonymous, with dn/ds ratios between  <dig> - <dig>  . for the most extensive gene variant clusters, contigs were predominantly highly overlapping and biased toward the 3' end of mrnas . a similar occurrence of gene variants was evident in the o. marina ccmp <dig> est dataset. an additional cap <dig> assembly of the combined o. marina data highlighted a limited degree of overlap  and ~ <dig> gene variant clusters in the ccmp <dig> ests . the most abundant gene cluster in ccmp <dig> consisted of  <dig> variants, but was not identifiable by blast similarity searches against nr or nt databases. the largest gene variant cluster for which both strains possessed multiple gene variants was a type ii rhodopsin gene.

tandem gene arrangements
the genomic context of variants was explored for  <dig> candidate genes . in all cases, outward orientated primers designed against cdna sequences generated pcr products confirming that genes were present as tandem repeated copies. subsequent pcr and sequencing confirmed the length of intergenic regions . cloning and sequencing of alpha tubulin and hsp <dig> pcr amplicons revealed the occurrence of a single 195bp intergenic region  for alpha tubulin and for hsp <dig>   <dig> variable igrs . by percent identity hsp <dig> igrs formed  <dig> groups ; groups  <dig> and  <dig> consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> igrs, respectively. group  <dig> igrs were also associated with an aspartic acid/glutamic acid substitution, occurring  <dig> residues from the stop codon . five-prime ends of hsp <dig> and alpha tubulin cdnas were confirmed to terminate in a generic dinoflagellate spliced leader sequence; the intergenic spacer/5' utr boundary was inferred from alignment of cdnas and genomic sequences. five-prime utrs were  <dig> and 77bp in hsp <dig> and alpha tubulin, respectively. in both cases spliced leader sequences were spliced at an 'ag' acceptor site .

gene content and functional annotation
a total of  <dig> contigs could be assigned to  <dig> or more go categories . go annotation for biological processes  highlighted the dominance of contigs associated with metabolic processes , with fewer contigs involved with cellular organisation  and regulation . similarly, contigs were assigned to a range of level  <dig> cellular components, including intercellular components, membranes, organelles and protein- and ribonucleoprotein-complexes .

the functional distribution of the go-assigned o. marina contigs is relatively typical of eukaryotes, representing a broad range of biological processes and cellular components. notably 60- <dig> ribosomal proteins , out of an expected typical eukaryotic complement of 75- <dig>  <cit>  were present. figure  <dig> provides a summary of the distribution of molecular function  categories and indicates that the majority of contigs are associated with binding processes  and catalytic activity . the most abundant transcripts connected with molecular binding processes include actin , rho-associated protein kinase  <dig> , v-type proton atpase catalytic subunit a , serine/threonine-protein kinase , dna replication licensing factor mcm <dig> , and nucleoside diphosphate kinase  <dig> . abundant contigs were involved with catalysis include cathepsin b-like cysteine proteinase  <dig> , aldehyde dehydrogenase , 2-nitropropane dioxygenase , ankyrin repeat-containing protein , calcium-dependent protein kinase , and 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase subunit alpha .

a diverse range of genes associated with amino acid synthesis also occurred in the dataset. based on the kegg pathways database  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acid biosynthesis, metabolism, and degradation pathways had partial representation in the o. marina dataset  and  <dig> genes with discernable function within these pathways were detected . genes associated with the biosynthesis of  <dig> 'essential' amino acids  were also present. three of these amino acid/nitrogen metabolism genes - dihydrodipicolinate reductase  <dig> , glutamine synthetase , and ketol-acid reductoisomerase  - are typically associated with plastids .

a complete list of assignments, and identifications are included in additional file  <dig> 

differential transcript abundance/gene expression in response to salinity
growth rate of o. marina was significantly higher in the  <dig> psu treatment . based on an analysis of total read counts,  <dig> contigs were significantly differentially represented in salinity treatments . nine and  <dig> contigs were over or under expressed  in the  <dig> psu treatment. of the ostensibly differentially expressed transcripts,  <dig> were nominally identified by blast identity . differences in expression varied markedly for transcripts over or under expressed at  <dig> psu. for under expressed transcripts, differences ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> fold; total read counts varied between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and were inversely proportional to fold difference . for over expressed transcripts differences ranged between  <dig> - <dig>  fold, and total read counts varied between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> reads . a large proportion of contigs  were rare  and occurred in only  <dig> of the  <dig> treatments .  <dig>   <dig> contigs were present in the  <dig> psu treatment but absent in  <dig> psu;  <dig> contigs were present at  <dig> psu but absent at  <dig> psu.

quantitative pcr validation assays were successful for  <dig> target genes . target gene expression was normalised to  <dig> control genes . six and  <dig> targets were identified as over or under expressed at  <dig> psu, respectively, and greatest fold differences between treatments occurred for beta-tubulin, 40s ribosomal protein, and phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase  genes. comparison of relative expression patterns estimated from qpcr and  <dig> read abundance indicated extensive discrepancies between the  <dig> approaches. in  <dig> out of  <dig> comparisons, the direction of expression differences was the same based on the  <dig> approaches. in the remaining  <dig> cases there were substantial differences in relative expression level estimates; for example, estimates of expression for hsp <dig> were  <dig>  fold over expressed at  <dig> psu versus  <dig>  fold under expressed for  <dig> and qpcr based estimates, respectively .

discussion
oxyrrhis - an emerging genomic model
recent interest in the genetic and genomic architecture of o. marina has informed the evolutionary history of a range of conspicuous dinoflagellate traits. for example, it is now clear that the rna trans-splicing mechanism, seemingly ubiquitous within the dinoflagellates, also occurs within o. marina and the more distantly related perkinsus marinus  <cit> , suggesting that trans-splicing was established early in the ancestral lineage leading to the dinoflagellates. in contrast, studies of the mitochondrial genome indicate that the large but highly fragmented structure, again a feature of this taxon, is a more recent trait as it is common to the dinoflagellates and o. marina but probably not to perkinsus  <cit> . perhaps the most conspicuous dinoflagellate feature, the seeming massive genome sizes harboured by some species , also predates o. marina  but occurred after the divergence of oxyrrhis/dinoflagellates from perkinsus, in which the genome is of more typical proportion . thus it is clear that o. marina is of increasing significance in the study of alveolate evolution.

here we further indicate that tandem gene arrangements and abundant expressed gene variants are common in o. marina. est surveys of several dinoflagellates have highlighted the occurrence of multiple transcripts coding for the same gene product  <cit> , and detailed studies of specific genes have revealed complex gene arrangements and expressed gene variants in several species . in o. marina, previous study has shown abundant gene transcript variants for actin, hsp <dig>  and rhodopsin . we indicate the same phenomenon here, with nominally  <dig> identified expressed genes  present as up to  <dig> variants, for which the majority of nucleotide variation was synonymous. a comparison with existing ests indicates even more extensive gene variant clusters in o. marina ccmp <dig>  in both cases, a large number of variant clusters were not identifiable by blast searches against genbank databases and no obvious functional class of genes appeared to dominant the most abundant variant clusters. for 44_ply <dig> the largest gene cluster occurred for phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase, a gene associated with purine metabolism  <cit> , and the largest variant cluster in ccmp <dig> coded for a type ii rhodopsin gene. notably, slamovits et al.  <cit>  have described ~ <dig> variants encoding rhodopsin in strain ccmp1788; here we detected far fewer variants . this discrepancy may simply be a result of different methodologies. oxyrrhis marina cultures in this study were grown in the dark, and given the likely role of rhodopsin in phototaxis  <cit> , it would seem a potential that this treatment may reduce rhodopsin expression. alternatively, differences in gene variant abundance may occur between strains. whether structural or transcriptional differences exist at this level has yet to be examined, though global comparisons of the 44_ply <dig> and ccmp <dig> datasets using blast and cap <dig>  both highlighted limited similarity . we have previously documented extensive genetic diversity within o. marina  <cit>  and strains ccmp <dig> and 44_ply <dig> occur within different o. marina clades  based on sequence variation at  <dig> gene loci  <cit> . whilst it is beyond the scope of the current study, it is likely that comparative assessments of gene/genome complement, arrangement, and structure at a range of phylogenetic between basal dinoflagellates will be highly informative. in particular, such comparative strategies will be useful to assess the rate of change of, for example, gene copy number at a key evolutionary juncture within the alveolates.

in addition to the occurrence of extensive expressed gene variants we have also shown that genes encoding transcribed variants occur as tandem repeated arrays in o. marina, an arrangement that has been demonstrated for a number of other dinoflagellate taxa  <cit> . the  <dig> genes examined here  were each arrayed in tandem, separated by short intergenic regions. hsp <dig> occurs in several contexts, with  <dig> major variants of the intergenic region; notably however, based on 3' utr sequence the variants detected in a genomic context did not tally with those present in the rnaseq dataset. given that mrna sequences for hsp <dig> were fragmented and incomplete at the 3' end it is most likely that the corresponding portion of transcripts were simply missing in the rnaseq data, though it is also possible that we have under sampled the existing variation for this gene. in contrast, only a single intergenic sequence was recovered for alpha tubulin, which did match the mrna sequence. in both cases cdnas were trans-spliced, a universal feature of dinoflagellate transcription  <cit> , and the trans-splicing acceptor site corresponded to an 'ag' signal as noted in other dinoflagellates  <cit> . of course, as a result of potential amplification biases associated with pcr detection, the actual diversity of intergenic regions is difficult to assess; nevertheless the occurrence of tandem gene repeats separated by different intergenic spacers suggests a number of potential genomic arrangements. different intergenic spacers potentially indicate the occurrence of multiple tandem arrays at different genomic loci. alternatively, individual arrays may be a complex arrangement of gene copies and heterogeneous intergenic spacers. notably an in situ hybridisation based study of several genes in o. marina indicated  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genomic locations for actin, alpha tubulin, and hsp <dig>  <cit> . the precise structure and the extent of these tandem gene arrays remains to be investigated in o. marina; regardless, it is now increasingly clear that gene duplication is extensive in dinoflagellates more generally, and results in complex gene arrangements  highlighted that, in addition to phagotrophy, o. marina displayed a "plant-like" biochemistry including the ability to synthesise the full complement of amino-acids from ammonium or other simple nitrogen sources. while amino acid biosynthesis capability in heterotophic protists is exceptionally diverse, an absolute requirement for several amino acids is typical  <cit> . a broad range of transcripts indentified in this study were associated with amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis; based on the kegg databases  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acid biosynthesis pathways were represented by  <dig>  <dig> contigs. the ability to undertake population growth on a fully synthetic medium with relatively simple absolute requirements  and an exceptionally broad phagotrophic capacity  make o. marina exceptional. one mechanism by which o. marina may have gained its biosynthetic capacity is via an ancestral plastid or ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont  <cit> . the occurrence of plastid targeting signalling peptides and genes that are almost certainly plastid or cyanobacterial in origin  are certainly strong support for such a mechanism.

more generally, based on go and blast annotations a broad range of gene families and metabolic processes are nominally represented in the o. marina rnaseq library presented here. however, estimation of transcriptomic diversity, the comprehensiveness of the sequencing, and thus the likely gene complement of o. marina is difficult in the absence of a reference or close reference genome. estimates of gene content based on genome size are possible; recent work by hou and lin  <cit>  shows a strong non-linear correlation between genome size and protein-coding gene number across a broad range of eukaryotes. hou and lin  <cit>  estimate total gene content of the largest dinoflagellate genomes to be on the order of 80- <dig>   <dig> genes comprising ~1% of the total genome. an estimated dna content for o. marina of ~ <dig>  pg cell- <dig>  <cit>  places its genome within the dinoflagellate range  and suggests some ~ <dig>   <dig> genes . gene-content predictions of this magnitude are exceptionally high in comparison to other eukaryotes; however, as noted above, many genes in dinoflagellates occur in high copy numbers ; thus, it is possible that much of the 'gene space' in dinoflagellates is occupied by multi-copy genes and the total proteomic diversity is closer to that displayed by eukaryotes more generally  <cit> .

the representation of conserved gene classes also provides an approximate indication of transcriptome coverage. in this study we detected  <dig> ribosomal protein coding transcripts of the 75- <dig> that are typical of most eukaryotes  <cit> ; while contigs did not represent full transcripts and such a comparison can only give a crude estimate these figures suggest a representation in the region of 75% of the transcriptome. it should be noted however, that comparison of the rnaseq and est datasets for o. marina potentially conflict with this estimate. assuming strains are relatively similar , the degree of overlap in transcriptome sequence datasets between strains was relatively small , potentially indicating a high degree of under-sequencing in both cases. of course, strains might differ more than suspected, or biases in sequencing  might reduce overlap between the datasets. in either case, it seems clear that comprehensive sampling of the o. marina transcriptome is likely to require a further substantial sequencing effort.

transcriptomic novelty and the problem of identification by identity
we have identified a number of interesting features of the o. marina transcriptome adding to previous descriptions of an unusual gene content in this organism. however, the majority of the sequences generated in this study were not identified by identity searches. this limited identification success, whilst partially accounted for by a 3' bias in this dataset , is nevertheless diagnostic of a broader difficultly for genomic studies of dinoflagellates. while, the dinoflagellates are increasingly regarded as important targets for the study of genome evolution, large scale sequence resources are only relatively recently accumulating  <cit> . this poor sequence representation has an impact on the current use of such databases for sequence identification. for example, within the ncbi databases, est datasets  exist for only  <dig> dinoflagellate species, and the majority of ests  are derived from just  <dig> species. similarly, in a genomic context, only a handful of plastid genomes and genome sequence surveys exist for dinoflagellates and the majority of nucleotide sequences are environmental rdnas. consequently, identification of new sequences via database searches presents a significant challenge for dinoflagellate taxa.

in context, the relatively low annotation rate achieved in this study is, therefore, not surprising. est projects on metazoa, with relatively close ancestry to many genomic model organisms, can yield high proportions of ests  that are identified by reference to existing sequence databases . by contrast, only  <dig>   <dig>  contigs were identified for o. marina, and less than 2% of transcripts matched to a single relatively closely related species, such as perkinsus marinus. comparably low rates of annotation have been reported for other dinoflagellate est projects, with only 9% of the  ests isolated from alexandrium ostenfeldii homologous to known proteins  <cit>  and ~20%  of ests from alexandrium tamerense identified  <cit> . while ests from a number of other eukaryotic protist taxa, for example diatoms, do not appear to be so different from the protein and transcript data available in public databases, a typical annotation rate of ~50% of transcripts again highlights gaps in genomic information  <cit> . most notably a recent est project on perkinsus marinus generated ~ <dig>   <dig> est sequences, clustered into ~ <dig>   <dig> unique sequences of which 55% were identified  <cit> ; possibly the higher annotation rate in this case is a result of the closer  phylogenetic affinity between perkinsus and the apicomplexa . it is notable that only  <dig> o. marina transcripts produced significant identity to p. marinus sequences, and only  <dig> matches occurred between o. marina contigs and those from other dinoflagellate taxa. whether, this is a genuine result of a high degree of novelty of the o. marina genome or a simple result of limited genomic data can only be confirmed by further genome scale sequencing, although inferences from phylogenetic analysis do suggest that oxyrrhis represents a highly divergent and novel lineage  <cit> .

identification of salinity tolerance mechanisms by differential gene expression
the application of next-generation sequencing technology to directly characterise transcript abundance is an increasingly used strategy for gene expression profiling  <cit> . the most precise strategies quantify either 5'or 3'  cdna fragments and thus overcome potential biases associated with sequence read length and incomplete reverse transcription  <cit> ; but for species that lack genome references  this approach negates the generation of full or near full length coding sequences, which are typically a valuable output of transcriptome sequencing projects in the case of poorly characterised organisms. our aim here was to determine whether a de novo transcript assembly can be used concurrently with an experiment to obtain an informative gene expression profile.

comparisons of transcript abundance profiles for cells grown under  <dig> salinity treatments nominally identified differing gene expression patterns and in combination with growth rate estimates seemed to provide evidence for specific physiological responses and a tangible molecular mechanism. a higher maximum grow rate at  <dig> psu, was concurrent with a relatively strong induction of ~ <dig> transcripts at this salinity. likewise, a reduced growth rate and modest induction of a different set of  <dig> genes occurred at  <dig> psu. however, agreement between transcript abundance and qpcr gene expression estimates were relatively poor, both in terms of direction and magnitude, and in only  <dig> out of  <dig> assays were expression estimates similar. in a broader context, gene expression patterns derived via different methodologies  often do not strongly correlate, although there appears to be more concordance between qpcr and next-generation sequencing platforms than with microarrays , which may relate to overall transcript abundance  <cit> . it is clear from a range of studies that some features of next generation sequencing protocols not specifically designed/targeted to quantify transcript abundance potentially generate significant biases in representation . from the study presented here for example, the representation of a number of gene transcripts in the o. marina rnaseq dataset by numerous non-overlapping fragments  is clearly problematic and is likely a result of either incomplete cdna synthesis and/or a proportion of read assembly errors. likewise, the occurrence of extensive expressed gene variants, seemingly common in most dinoflagellates has the potential to result in extensive discrepancy between sequence and qpcr bases approaches; particularly if qpcr assays co-amplify extensive gene variant families.

accepting the above issues, those genes whose expression profiles were confirmed by qpcr did tentatively suggest a potential underlying salinity response. in  <dig> cases qpcr and  <dig> expression estimates identified genes as up regulated at  <dig> psu; most notable was the up regulation of phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase - this enzyme is a component of a common pathway in plants that generates the osmoprotectant glycine betaine  <cit> . thus, increased salinity appears to elicit a decrease in specific growth rate and tentatively a concurrent osmoregulatory response. clearly such an inference is speculative and confirmation of the occurrence of this metabolic pathway in o. marina is required.

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated some  <dig>  cdna sequence contigs for the basal dinoflagellate o. marina. blast searches identified ~14% of contigs; this relatively modest level of identification is likely due to o. marina's unusual phylogenetic position and the limited sequence data for dinoflagellate taxa more generally. nonetheless, we have identified a large number of transcripts associated with amino acid biosynthesis, and demonstrated the occurrence of extensive expressed gene variants and tandem gene arrangements; thus further highlighting the utility of next-generation sequencing platforms for generating de novo large scale sequence data to characterise non-genetic-model taxa. additionally in this study, comparisons of relative read abundance of cells grown under differing osmotic stress nominally identified ~ <dig> genes differentially regulated in response to salinity. while agreement between sequencing and qpcr based gene expression estimates was relatively poor; qpcr expression data tentatively identified candidate genes for further study of salinity tolerance in this taxon. in an evolutionary context, this is one of the first 454-based transcriptome surveys of an ancestral dinoflagellate taxon and will undoubtedly prove useful for future comparative studies aimed at reconstructing the origin of novel features of the dinokaryon. in an ecological context, these data highlight candidate genes for further research into potential adaptive mechanisms behind broad geographic distributions in eukaryotic microbes.
