BACKGROUND
adult stem cell maintenance is crucial for tissue homeostasis. tissues with a high turnover rate, such as intestinal epithelium, sperm, and hematopoietic cells, rely on stem cells for constant replenishment of cellular populations  <cit> . further, damage to these and other tissue types require heightened proliferation of resident stem cells to facilitate tissue regeneration. however, this proliferation must be tightly regulated: stem cells must respond appropriately to growth demands while limiting the potential for tumorigenesis  <cit> . precise control of stem cell dynamics is governed by a specialized microenvironment called the niche . short-range cues from the niche sustain the stem cell population, while allowing the production of differentiated daughters further away. many niches are now known to regulate more than one stem cell type, and stem cells themselves or their direct progeny can sometimes function as a signaling component  <cit> .

the testis of drosophila melanogaster provides a robust and genetically tractable system to study adult stem cells in their natural environment, and it has been well-characterized . a cluster of 8– <dig> post-mitotic somatic cells comprises a major component of the niche, called the hub . the hub supports germline stem cells  and somatic cyst stem cells . gscs divide asymmetrically to self-renew and generate a gonialblast, which will give rise to mature sperm . cyscs can divide to self-renew or generate cyst cells, which exit mitosis and, in pairs, encase each developing germ cell  <cit> . mature cyst cells are required for gsc differentiation, which suggests cyscs can act as a signaling component of the niche .

the hub provides signals and structural organization to the niche, acting as a stem cell docking site. during development, hub cells undergo a change in gene expression, which includes the up-regulation of growth factors and cytokine-like molecules of the unpaired  family  <cit> . in drosophila, upd  is a secreted signaling molecule that activates the highly conserved janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathway  <cit> . upd released from the hub turns on jak/stat signaling in neighboring stem cells, which is required for them to stay undifferentiated .

jak/stat signaling is essential in a variety of organisms for normal development and stem cell maintenance  <cit> . for example, mammalian hematopoeisis and inflammatory responses require cytokine signaling via jak/stat activation. the pathway must be tightly regulated as excessive stat signaling correlates with tumorigenesis , and in drosophila adult testis hyperactivation or loss of function of stat  disrupts stem cell maintenance . stat activation promotes e-cadherin -directed adhesion of the gscs to the hub, necessary for maintaining stem-cell properties  <cit> . in cyscs, stat activity facilitates integrin-based adhesion to the hub and signals for self-renewal . two downstream targets of stat, zinc finger homeodomain- <dig>   <cit>  and chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis   <cit>  maintain cysc fate, in part by preventing the cysc-to-cyst cell transition. ectopic stat activation or zfh- <dig> expression in the testis expands the cysc population, which prevents differentiation of both cyscs and gscs  <cit> . since stat activity must be finely tuned in stem cell populations to balance self-renewal and differentiation, it is important to understand how stat regulation is genetically controlled.

the transcriptional regulator apontic  is a key regulator of jak/stat signaling in the drosophila ovary  <cit> . during drosophila oogenesis, a subset of germline-encasing, somatic epithelial  cells form an invasive cluster, called the border cells . border cell specification and migration require jak/stat signaling . however, excessive pathway activation leads to additional invasive cells and a delay in cluster migration  <cit> . apt restricts jak/stat activation in anterior follicle cells and limits migration to an optimal number of cells  <cit> . we, and others, have determined that apt functions as a feedback inhibitor of stat activity by regulating the expression of two direct stat pathway inhibitors: suppressor of cytokine signaling at 36e  and the stat-targeting microrna mir- <dig>  <cit> . this led us to investigate a role for apt in other contexts.

here, we report that apt functions in the cyscs of adult testes to attenuate stat signaling and limit stem cell numbers. as in ovaries, apt expression in cyscs partially depends on stat activity, and its feedback inhibition of stat signaling functions through a regulatory network including socs36e and mir- <dig>  while other known stat targets in cyscs promote self-renewal, apt cell-autonomously permits timely stem cell differentiation. our data demonstrate that apt facilitates robust regulation of stat activity to regulate stem cell numbers in drosophila testes.

methods
fly stocks and husbandry
flies were raised on standard cornmeal-molasses food; all crosses were performed at 25 °c. the following fly stocks were utilized: canton s and w <dig> , tubp-gal80ts  <cit> , upd-gal <dig> , c587-gal <dig> , tj-gal <dig> , uas-tdf/mkrs , protein trap line ptt-gc aptcc <dig>  <cit> , stat92e397/tm <dig>   <cit> , two independent null mir- <dig> alleles , mir-279sponge  <cit> , uas-hoptum-l/cyo  <cit> , and uas-mcd8-gfp  <cit> . the apt loss-of-function mutant alleles used were: aptkg <dig>  <cit> , apttdf-pΔ4/cyo  <cit> , and apt167/cyo  <cit> . the trip collection provided: uas-aptrnai , uas-updrnai , and two uas-stat92e-rnai lines   <cit> .

inverse pcr was utilized to confirm and map the p-element insertion site of the protein trap ptt-gc aptcc <dig>  genomic dna was isolated from aptcc <dig> flies. dna was subsequently digested with pvuii   or msp <dig>  overnight at 37 °c. an overnight ligation reaction  was performed at 4 °c on the digested dna to promote self-ligation of the fragments. ligation products were amplified with pry <dig>  and pry <dig>  primers at an annealing temperature of 55 °c. purified pcr products were sequenced with the pep <dig>  primer by genewiz. blastn  and flybase  were utilized to analyze sequences.

to rescue the aptrnai phenotype, c587-gal4; uas-aptrnai/cyo flies were crossed to uas-tdf/mkrs  <cit> ; offspring and controls were incubated at 29 °c for  <dig> days prior to dissection. to generate socs36e deficient flies socs36eey <dig> and socs36e <dig> were crossed to produce transheterozygotes  <cit> . to test for a socs36e, apt genetic interaction, two independently derived stocks of the genotype socs36eey <dig>  apt167/cyo were crossed to socs36e <dig>  to create socs36e, apt double mutants, two socs36eey <dig>  apt167/cyo lines were crossed with a single recombinant stock socs36e <dig>  aptkg <dig>  <cit> .

flies bearing mutant alleles were kept at 25 °c for 0– <dig> days prior to dissection. gal <dig> containing males were incubated at 29 °c for 2 days before dissection for effective rnai expression. for genotypes in which c587-gal <dig> or upd-gal <dig> was combined with tubp-gal80ts and for the temperature matched controls, 0– <dig> day old experimental and temperature matched control males were shifted to 30 °c for 4 days. age-and-genotype-matched control males were kept unshifted at 25 °c for 4 days. males generated for experimental analysis were maintained at less than  <dig> males per vial and were transferred onto fresh food every 2– <dig> days until dissection.

testes dissections and immunofluorescence
males were dissected in schneider’s media containing 10 % fetal bovine serum  and  <dig> x pen/strep antibiotics . testes were fixed for 10 min at room temperature  in 4 % paraformaldehyde in pbx , washed at rt with pbx, and blocked for 1 h at rt ). antibodies were diluted in block and incubated with testes overnight at 4 °c. testes were washed with pbx prior to addition of molecular probes alexafluor secondary antibodies , which were diluted at 1: <dig> in pbx and incubated overnight at 4 °c. dapi was applied at 1: <dig>  for 10 min at rt; testes were washed with pbx, and stored in 50 % glycerol at 4 °c until mounted for imaging.

the following primary antibodies were utilized for analysis: rabbit anti-apontic , rabbit anti-stat , rabbit anti-zfh- <dig> , rabbit anti-vasa , guinea pig anti-traffic jam , and mouse anti-brdu conjugated with fluorophore alexa  <dig> . the following antibodies were obtained from the developmental studies hybridoma bank, developed under the auspices of the nichd, and maintained by the university of iowa, department of biology, iowa city, ia 52242: mouse anti-fasciclin  <dig> ; rat anti-dcad <dig> , rat anti-n-cadherin ; mouse anti-eyes absent .

images were obtained with a zeiss axioimager z. <dig> microscope equipped with axiovision software and apotome structural interference system for optical sectioning or a leica tcs 4d scanning confocal light microscope. images of testes stained with anti-zfh- <dig>  are 3d reconstructions projected into 2d, generated by fiji software  <cit> . all other images are a representative optical section of a z-stack. adobe photoshop cs <dig> and fiji software were utilized to process and format images.

analysis and quantification of gscs and total zfh-1-positive cell population
to determine the number of cyscs or gscs in the testis, we used zeiss axiovision or leica las software to generate z-stacks of optical sections of the apex in  <dig> – <dig>  μm steps. to be considered a gsc, a single vasa-positive cell had to be in direct contact with the hub. fiji or zeiss axiovision software was utilized to step through the z-stack to quantify all gscs in a single testis. for zfh- <dig> expression analysis, we counted all cells except hub cells that stained positively with a rabbit antibody directed against zfh- <dig>  either stepwise through a z-stack with zeiss axiovision software or through generation of a 3d reconstruction of the testis with zeiss axiovision or perkinelmer volocity software. we capped zfh-1+ cell counts at  <dig> per single testis, since if there were more cells they were very far from the niche. when testes were co-stained with anti-zfh- <dig> and anti-eya antibodies, zeiss axiovision and fiji software were utilized to assess co-expression of markers.

quantification of relative expression levels via fluorescent analysis
to obtain relative levels of apt or stat protein expression, all dissections and antibody stainings for a single experiment were performed together on the same day. images for each experiment were also acquired in a single day, with the same exposure times. for analysis, we used fiji software to circle nuclei with the freeform selector, and then used the measure tool to obtain average pixel intensity of several stem cells per testis in both the anti-apt or anti-stat and dapi positive channels  <cit> . for this study, we defined cyscs as the first tier of zfh- <dig> or tj-positive cells around the hub. dapi was used as an internal control to obtain a relative level of apt expression by generating an apt/dapi ratio. to acquire a normalized expression level of apt relative to the control, we set the control to one and derived an experimental/control ratio to calculate a relative fold-change in our experimental genotype.

analysis of e-cadherin expression levels
to assess e-cad expression, testes from w <dig> and aptkg <dig> homozygous males were dissected and stained with antibodies on the same day. images for each experiment were also acquired on a single day, with the same exposure times. images were analyzed as single optical sections and as a stack of optical sections projected in the 2d by fiji/image j. projections for both genotypes were constructed from a similar number of optical sections and represent a similar depth of tissue.

in vivo brdu labeling
testes were labeled with brdu  as previously described  <cit> . age-matched males of control and experimental genotypes were incubated for 2 days at 29 °c, for effective rnai expression. during this incubation, males were starved for 4 h. starved males were then fed  <dig>  mm brdu  for the final 20– <dig> h of the 29 °c incubation. only males with green abdomens were dissected. the same protocol described above for dissections was then utilized.

statistical analysis
all statistical analyses on cell count and expression data were executed via a two-tailed t-test. two-tailed fisher’s exact test  were utilized for statistical analysis of phenotypic penetrance. cell count data are displayed via non-parametric box and whisker plots. in these plots, the second  and third  quartile bars are separated by the median value. the diamond specifies the mean for each genotype. the upper whisker indicates the upper quartile through the maximum, while the lower whisker shows the minimum value observed through the first quartile. the standard deviation is provided  for all quantitative data not presented in graphs. for all statistical analysis, we maintained a significance requirement of at least p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
apontic protein is enriched in the adult testis apex
at the apex of the testis two stem cell populations surround the dome-shaped hub: somatic cyst stem cells  and germline stem cells  . to examine apt expression in the adult testis, we first used a protein trap for apt , which is predicted to create a gfp tagged full-length protein through mrna splicing  <cit> . we confirmed the location of the insertion to be downstream of at least one exon for all isoforms of apt . this reporter revealed enriched apt-gfp expression in the hub and surrounding cells . by co-staining with an antibody directed against the somatic cell marker traffic jam   <cit> , we confirmed that apt-gfp is expressed in the nuclei of cyscs, mature cyst cells, and distal pigment cells  <cit> , consistent with a previous report  <cit> . we also detected apt-gfp expression in the gscs. an antibody directed against apt showed the same expression pattern in testes from wild - type males  and overlapping expression with apt-gfp .fig.  <dig> apontic expression is enriched in the testis apex. a schematic of the adult drosophila testis apex. 8- <dig> germline stem cells  adhere to the hub  and divide asymmetrically to self-renew and generate a differentiated daughter, the gonialblast. cell division with incomplete cytokinesis produces  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  cell-cluster spermatogonia. a pair of somatic cyst stem cells  associates with each gsc, dividing asymmetrically to produce non-mitotic cyst cells , which grow and encase the developing germ cell. red indicates the fusome, which is a small sphere  in gscs and gonialblasts but is branched in spermatogonium. blue gradient behind the hub and triangle below schematic represents stat activity: the highest level of stat signaling  is found in cells adjacent to the hub, and it decreases distally . b schematic of the pttapt

stat activity promotes apontic expression in cyscs
stat signaling activates apt expression in the ovary  <cit> , so we examined this possibility in testis. prior work determined that activated stat binds to several sites in the apt gene regulatory region  <cit> . in addition, apt is expressed in testis stem cells , which exhibit high levels of stat activity  <cit> . to alter signaling levels and assay apt expression, we utilized the tissue-specific gal4/uas system  <cit> . first, we reduced stat92e specifically in cyscs and early cyst cells to assess cell-autonomous effects on apt expression. reduction of stat92e with either of two rnai lines, which we have previously verified  <cit> , expressed via the c587-gal <dig> driver  <cit> , significantly lowered apt reporter expression in cyscs, the first tier of zfh-1-positive  cells around the hub . conversely, constitutive activation of jak in the somatic cell population   <cit>  resulted in heightened apt protein levels in each cell .fig.  <dig> apontic is a downstream target of stat. a-b optical sections of testes from males of the specified genotypes in a pttapt

to reduce stat activity in stem cells non-autonomously, we reduced expression of the activator, upd, by expressing a previously-verified rnai line  <cit>  in adults with the hub-specific gal <dig> driver upd-gal <dig>  <cit>  and a temperature sensitive gal <dig> repressor, gal <dig>   <cit> . the presence of tsgal <dig> allowed normal upd expression throughout development at 25 °c, including during hub formation and stem cell establishment in embryonic testes  <cit> . adult males were shifted to 30 °c to deactivate tsgal <dig> and allow hub-specific expression of uas-updrnai. again, examination of apt protein by antibody staining , or gfp expression in the ptt-aptcc <dig> line , revealed a significantly lower level of apt expression in cyscs  when upd was reduced , relative to temperature-matched controls . the residual apt expression in the stat92ernai and updrnai experiments indicates that other factors contribute to apt expression in the testis. however, considered with the prior dna binding data  <cit> , these results suggest that apt is a downstream target of stat activity in cyscs of the testis.

apt limits the cysc/early cyst cell population and permits timely differentiation
given apt’s expression pattern, we wanted to determine whether apt mutations affected stem cell maintenance. we analyzed testes in which apt was reduced using characterized mutant alleles: aptkg <dig>  a homozygous viable p-element insertion line  <cit> , and apt <dig>  which contains a point mutation in the conserved dna binding domain  <cit> . the apt <dig> allele acts as a functional null and is homozygous lethal  <cit> , but is viable in trans to the hypomorphic allele aptkg <dig>  to assess cyscs, we examined expression of zfh- <dig>  a stat downstream target that is necessary and sufficient for cysc maintenance  <cit> . aptkg <dig> homozygotes and aptkg05830/apt <dig> males both displayed a significant increase in the zfh-1+ population near the hub compared to controls, suggesting the presence of additional cyscs or early cyst cells . analysis of the tj + population in testes from these males confirmed that the somatic population is expanded when apt is lost, relative to controls . to clarify the identity of these cells, we co-stained testes from apt mutants with antibodies directed against zfh- <dig> as well as eyes absent , a marker for mature cyst cells that is not expressed in cyscs or early cyst cells  <cit> . significantly more zfh-1+ cells are eya-negative in apt mutants, relative to controls . furthermore, some zfh-1+, eya cells were found to be distal from the hub, which was not often observed in wild - type testes . this spatial pattern of zfh- <dig> and eya expression in apt mutants indicates a delay in cyst cell maturation.fig.  <dig> apontic limits the zfh-1+ population. a total number of zfh-1+ cells in adult testes from flies of the specified genotypes, represented by a box and whisker plot: diamond gives the mean, horizontal line indicates the median . for a single testis, cell quantification was capped at  <dig>  so graphs likely represent an underestimate. b-c stacks of optical sections, projected into 2d, of testes stained with the following antibodies: zfh- <dig> expression  marks cyscs and immediate daughters, eyes absent  labels mature cyst cells, and fas <dig> indicates the hub . insets display zfh- <dig> or eya/fas <dig> staining alone. b in control testes , wild-type numbers of zfh-1+ cells are found proximal to the hub. arrows indicate zfh-1+/eya+ distal somatic cells. c in testes from an apt

to determine if apt loss of function caused the cyst cell phenotype cell-autonomously, we reduced apt specifically in cyscs and early cyst cells via c587-gal <dig> and a uas-controlled rnai line targeting apt. analysis in ovaries confirmed that expression of aptrnai in follicle cells phenocopied apt loss of function mutants . consistent with apt mutant alleles, tissue-specific reduction of apt showed a significantly expanded zfh-1+ population . we observed similar results using the tj-gal <dig> line, which drives expression in the hub, cyscs, and early cyst cells . re-introduction of full-length apt via c587-gal <dig> confirmed that the observed phenotype was due to loss of apt, as it restored wild-type number and organization of zfh-1+ cells . in contrast, over-expression of apt in cyscs in a wild-type background significantly reduced the number of zfh-1+ cells, which often led to complete localization of the zfh-1+ population next to the hub, and/or a significant decrease in the percentage of zfh-1+, eya cells, relative to controls . next, to prevent possible phenotypes caused by early loss of apt, we combined tsgal <dig> with c587-gal <dig> and aptrnai. we found a significant expansion of the zfh-1+ population when apt was reduced in adults, relative to the controls . again, co-expression of zfh- <dig> and the differentiation marker eya was less prevalent when apt was reduced in adults, relative to temperature-matched controls .

next, we wanted to determine if loss of apt yielded additional cyscs/cysc-like cells. while the additional zfh-1+ cells in mutants often lacked eya and could be cyscs, a more definitive marker of a stem cell is a periodic exit from quiescence. to assay cell division, we tested bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation, which occurs in dividing cells during s-phase. when apt was reduced in the soma, we found a significant increase in testes with at least one brdu+ somatic  cell several cell diameters away from the hub, relative to control testes . during eye development, apt facilitates the transition from g <dig> to s-phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . however, we did not observe a significant difference in cell division of tj + cells immediately surrounding the hub between apt loss of function and control testes . thus, the expansion of the zfh-1+ population when apt is reduced cannot be explained by an increased rate of cysc proliferation, and more likely indicates prolonged maintenance of cysc-like cells. collectively, these data suggest apt facilitates the differentiation program of cyscs.fig.  <dig> somatic loss of apt expands the cysc population. a-b projected images of optical sections of testes from males of the indicated genotypes, stained with antibodies directed against brdu  and tj . dapi  labels nuclei. the hub is outlined in blue. scale bar = 20μm. insets display single optical sections of indicated staining alone. a in control testes, cyscs divide at the hub . b when apt is reduced in the soma, a tj+ cell divides several cell diameters away from the hub . c percentage of testes, of the indicated genotypes, in which brdu+ somatic cells were observed. quantification was separated between cyscs  and tj+ cells more than one somatic cell tier away from the hub . two-tailed fisher’s exact tests were performed to analyze significance of the data, where *p< <dig>  and **p< <dig> . “n” indicates number of testes scored



apontic inhibits stat activity in cyscs
the expanded zfh-1+ population in apt mutants resembles the phenotype caused by excessive stat signaling in the soma  <cit> . to determine if apt inhibits stat activity in testes, as it does in ovaries, we altered somatic apt expression. we expressed apt below and above endogenous levels via aptrnai and a uas-apt transgene, respectively, with c587-gal <dig>  we monitored nuclear stat  protein levels in cyscs , since this sub-cellular localization provides a read-out for stat activity  <cit> . somatic reduction of apt cell-autonomously increased nstat protein levels relative to the control . conversely, high levels of apt in the cysc and early cyst cell populations resulted in decreased nstat in cyscs . quantification of this expression pattern revealed that the detectable amounts of nstat in cyscs changed significantly when apt was reduced or heightened . we obtained similar results using the tj-gal <dig> driver . interestingly, we observed tj+, nstat+ cells several cell diameters away from the hub when apt was reduced , consistent with an expanded zfh-1+  population. we did not observe this expression pattern in control testes . these results support the idea that apt negatively regulates stat activity.fig.  <dig> apontic functions as a feedback inhibitor of stat in the testes cyscs. a-c testes stained with antibodies recognizing stat  and tj  and counterstained with dapi . arrowheads indicate cyscs . insets display stat expression alone. a control testis shows wild-type stat expression: most detectable stat is found in the gscs around the hub , but it decreases in gonialblasts and cyscs . b more stat is detectable when apt is reduced in somatic cells via c587-gal <dig>  c stat expression is reduced in the cyscs when apt is over-expressed via c587-gal <dig>  d nuclear stat  levels were quantified in cyscs and normalized to dapi intensity. tj staining was utilized to outline nuclei of cyscs for measurement . c587-gal4; aptrnai and c587-gal4;; uas-apt were normalized to the rnai-alone control to obtain a relative expression level. somatic reduction of apt significantly increases nstat levels in cyscs, while heightened levels of apt significantly reduces nstat in cyscs. e-h optical sections projected into 2d of testes stained with zfh- <dig> , eya , and ncad  antibodies. insets display zfh- <dig> expression. hub, indicated by ncad expression, is outlined in blue. a single copy mutation in stat92e  or reduction of stat92e via c587-gal4  in testes with reduced apt in cyscs and early cyst cells suppresses the expansion of the zfh-1+ population observed when apt alone is reduced  and is similar to the control . i quantification of the zfh-1+ population of indicated genotypes. genetic reduction of stat92e function  when apt is reduced via c587-gal4 results in a wild-type quantity of zfh-1+ cells. j proportion of zfh-1+ cells that did not co-express the differentiation marker eya in testes from the genotypes in . one copy of a stat92e mutation in an apt deficient background restores the zfh-1+/eya- percentage to wild type. for all images scale bar = 20μm. two-tailed t-tests were utilized to assess significance in  and , while a two-tailed fisher’s exact test was used in , where *p< <dig> , **p< <dig> , ***p< <dig> , ****p< <dig> , and n.s. denotes not significant. all statistics were performed between the experimental genotype and aptrnai/+  or c587>mgfp  controls unless otherwise indicated by a black bar. “n” indicates number of testes scored



if apt attenuates stat signaling, then the apt mutant phenotype should be suppressed by reducing stat92e expression. in support of this, when apt expression was lowered, we found that additional removal of one functional copy of the stat92e gene, or reducing stat92e expression in cyscs and early cyst cells using c587-gal <dig>  resulted in a zfh-1+ population that was approximately wild type in cell numbers and organization . reduction of stat92e function, globally or via c587-gal <dig>  lowered the percentage of zfh-1+, eya cells to wild type . given the expression pattern and mutant analysis, we propose that apt functions as a feedback inhibitor of stat signaling in adult cyscs, which enables a proper spatiotemporal transition from cysc to mature cyst cell.

apt functions in a stat-regulatory genetic circuit to promote cyst cell development
apt activates expression of stat inhibitors during oogenesis  <cit> . to determine if apt has similar targets in testes, we examined suppressor of cytokine signaling at 36e  – a conserved post-transcriptional regulator of stat  <cit> . socs36e inhibits stat activity in cyscs and regulates their adhesion to the hub  <cit> ; however, loss of socs36e does not increase the zfh-1+ population . using the hypomorphic allele socs36eey <dig> and the strong loss of function allele socs36e <dig>  <cit> , we looked for a genetic interaction between socs36e and apt. socs36e, apt double homozygous mutants displayed an expanded zfh-1+ population very similar to loss of apt alone . interestingly, reduction of apt in a socs36e deficient background  partially phenocopied the zfh-1+ cell number expansion observed in testes from apt homozygous mutant males , c, and  <cit> ). these results are consistent with the idea that apt functions through socs36e in cyscs.fig.  <dig> apontic inhibits stat function via a conserved genetic circuit in testes. a-b, d-e 2-d projections of optical sections of testes stained with antibodies directed against zfh- <dig> , eya , and n-cad . insets show zfh- <dig> expression alone. a a testis from a socs36e mutant male contains a wild-type number and organization of zfh-1+ cells. b a single copy reduction of apt function  in a socs36e

apt promotes expression of the stat-targeting microrna mir- <dig> in ovaries  <cit> . to test if this regulator also acts in cyscs, we utilized a mir- <dig> sponge, which binds and decreases the endogenous microrna  <cit> . expressing the mir- <dig> sponge in cyscs and early cyst cells via c587-gal <dig> led to a significant increase in the total number of zfh-1+ cells . to determine if mir- <dig> function depends on or overlaps with apt in testes, we generated apt-/+; mir-279-/+ double heterozygous flies  <cit> . testes from these flies had significantly more zfh-1+ cells relative to a single copy reduction of mir- <dig> or apt alone . combined, these data suggest that somatic stat activity is finely tuned via a genetic regulatory circuit that is conserved in distinct processes during male and female gametogenesis.

apt limits the gsc population at the hub interface
while the hub is a key organizer of the niche, cyscs also function as a gsc niche component . since loss of apt function results in an expanded zfh-1+ population, we examined whether the gscs were affected. using an antibody for vasa to label germ cells  <cit> , we assessed the gsc population when apt was reduced in the soma by rnai, focusing near the niche. for this, we defined a gsc as a vasa-positive single cell directly interacting with the hub. despite an increase in zfh-1+ cells, we found no change in the number of gscs at the hub interface when apt was reduced in cyscs and early cyst cells  relative to the gfp control .

in contrast, examination of the gsc population in testes of males homozygous for the aptkg <dig> allele or bearing two different apt alleles   <cit>  revealed a significant increase in the number of gscs, relative to control testes . these data suggest apt may function in the gscs.

stat regulates e-cad in the germline  <cit> . consistent with apt functioning as a stat-regulator in the stem cell populations, we found altered expression of e-cad in the cell populations directly surrounding the hub in aptkg <dig> homozygous males, relative to wild-type controls . specifically, we detected e-cad all around the cells, not just at the hub interface, suggesting it was more highly expressed, or mislocalized, or both. co-staining with an antibody targeting vasa verified that gscs were among the cells with heightened e-cad accumulation.

since allelic and tissue-specific reduction of apt both resulted in an expanded zfh-1+ population , we set out to determine why we observed distinct gsc phenotypes. assessment of aptkg <dig> homozygotes by antibody staining revealed that apt protein is mildly reduced in cyscs but is expressed below detectable levels in gscs . collectively, these data support the possibility that significant loss of apt in the gscs, relative to cyscs, alters gsc adhesion to the hub resulting in their accumulation. thus, these data may suggest apt is required in both stem cell types, and that the levels of apt expression must be fine-tuned between each population to establish a balance at the hub interface.

discussion
here, we show that the transcriptional regulator apt is required for maintaining a wild-type number of stem cells in the testis apex. within cyscs, this function is dependent on apt’s inhibition of stat activity, which promotes stem cell differentiation cell-autonomously. we found that a high level of conservation exists in a stat-feedback genetic regulatory network that limits this stem cell population as well as cell invasion in ovarian follicle cells  <cit> . despite obvious distinctions between these processes, each requires a correct number of different cell types to be allocated to the tissue. pathways essential for each process, such as jak/stat, are often aberrantly activated in pathogenesis, such as cancer development, and thus require intense regulation  <cit> .

a conserved genetic regulatory circuit is essential for stem cell differentiation
apt is expressed in the adult testes somatic population  and gscs and gonialblasts. we verified that apt is expressed downstream of stat in the cyscs. however, mature cyst cells do not have detectable stat activation, which suggests that, like in the egg chamber, apt is regulated in stat-dependent and independent manners  <cit> . while apt is expressed in all anterior follicle cells of the egg chamber, stat signaling in the anterior epithelium is more restricted . eya, which is expressed in a similar pattern as apt in follicle cells, is required to activate apt expression broadly  <cit> . in wild-type somatic cells of the testes, stat activity and eya expression have complementary patterns – eya is not expressed until cyst cell maturation, when stat is turned off  <cit> . thus, in cyscs and early cyst cells apt is regulated by stat, then akin to the ovary, eya may maintain apt expression in the mature cyst cells.

we found that in the drosophila testis apt is a keystone in a stat genetic regulatory network, acting as a feedback inhibitor in somatic stem cells . of the three previously described stat downstream targets in cyscs – zfh- <dig>  chinmo, and socs36e – two prevent cysc differentiation  <cit> , while socs36e affects cysc adhesion, but not fate  <cit> . our data suggest apt is distinct in that it permits the transition from cysc-to-mature cyst cell. while self-renewal of stem cell populations is essential, the ability to differentiate is also critical for tissue repair and regeneration  <cit> . for differentiation to occur in cyscs, stat signaling must be shut down in the daughter dividing away from the hub  <cit> . loss of apt in cyscs delays this transition, reflected in a significant expansion of the zfh-1+ ) population that maintains the potential to undergo cell division away from the hub. while clonal mutant analysis using a null allele of apt in the cyscs might help clarify apt’s distinct roles, we have been unsuccessful in obtaining males of the necessary genotype for this experiment, despite multiple attempts. nevertheless, the results from viable mutants as well as temperature-regulated knockdown in overlapping expression domains consistently and strongly suggest apt is a feedback inhibitor of the jak/stat pathway that is required for cysc maturation.fig.  <dig> apt functions as a feedback inhibitor of the jak/stat pathway in cyscs. apontic  is required in the cyscs as a feedback inhibitor of stat signaling to promote the cysc to cyst cell transition: see text for details. apt’s genetic interactions with the stat-targeting mir- <dig> and the conserved inhibitor of stat, socs36e, suggest it may mediate expression of these targets, as in ovaries. gsc=germline stem cell, cysc=cyst stem cell



stat regulates cysc adhesion to the hub  <cit> . it is, therefore, conceivable to think that the expansion of the zfh-1+ population in apt mutants is partially due to increased adhesion of the cyscs and early cyst cells to the niche area. this would enable these cells to continue to receive the self-renewal cues. furthermore, the amount of cysc division did not appear altered between control and loss of apt testes, which suggests that apt does not work through cyclin e regulation in this tissue  <cit> . instead, we discovered a significant increase in nuclear stat levels in cyscs with reduced apt. thus, apt is required in cyscs to attenuate stat, which allows efficient and correct spatiotemporal somatic cell maturation in adults.

loss of the stat feedback inhibitor socs36e increases stat activity without affecting cysc numbers  <cit> . however, when we removed a single copy of apt in a socs36e mutant background, the zfh-1+ population significantly increased. although apt can activate socs36e expression  <cit> , the inability of socs36e reduction to alter the number of cyscs led us to hypothesize apt may inhibit stat through another regulator, as well. a genetic interaction between apt and the stat92e targeting mir- <dig>  <cit>  supports this idea. unlike loss of socs36e, reduction of mir- <dig> in the cysc and early cyst cell populations significantly expanded the zfh-1+ population. while we cannot rule out any direct regulation of stat by apt, our data strongly suggest a conserved genetic circuit attenuates stat activity in cyscs, which is required to allocate an appropriate balance of cells that will self-renew and differentiate .

similarly when apt was lost in the germline, we observed a significant accumulation of gscs at the hub interface. stat has been shown to promote the expression of e-cad in gscs  <cit> , and integrin expression in cyscs , in both cases facilitating interaction with the hub. loss of apt in the germline resulted in heightened e-cad expression in the gscs. these data support a model in which apt negatively regulates stat activity in the gscs and that the loss of apt may increase the adhesiveness of gscs to the hub. the mild reduction of apt expression in the cyscs in these experiments may suggest that the relative levels of apt between the two stem cell populations mediates a balance between the stem cell populations - possibly through adhesion molecule expression, since adherence to the hub is important for maintaining stem-ness in both cell types. collectively, our data suggest apt is essential in both stem cell populations of the drosophila testes to ensure appropriate maintenance and differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we postulate that apt functions as a feedback inhibitor of jak/stat activation in the cyscs via its regulation of socs36e and mir- <dig> . this genetic regulatory network is essential to prevent stem cell over-population by enabling cysc maturation. our data also suggest that appropriate expression levels of apt between the cyscs and gscs are important to maintain a balance of the stem cell populations at the hub interface. collectively, this work shows that apt is an important regulator of stem cell dynamics in the drosophila testis.
