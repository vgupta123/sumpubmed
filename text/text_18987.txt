BACKGROUND
temperature is a fundamental feature that affects all living organisms. each species, particularly ectotherms, has a non-stressful thermal tolerance range and responds to temperature by physiological, biochemical, and molecular level adjustments that underlie adaptation. for instance, many latitudinal clines exist in drosophila for allele frequencies at allozyme loci, chromosomal inversions, and microsatellites; as well as for traits like starvation resistance, desiccation resistance, and body size where the differences between populations have a genetic basis and can even persist for many generations under laboratory reared conditions  <cit> . by and large, the empirical evidence suggests that variation in these markers and traits are directly or indirectly related to temperature  gradients. perhaps the most pertinent example comes from recent studies on chromosomal inversion polymorphisms showing that the genetic constitution of populations is responding to contemporary rapid global warming  <cit> .

the native palearctic fly drosophila subobscura spans more than 30° latitude in the old world: from north africa to scandinavia. as a result, its populations experience a strong climatic gradient  <cit> . in the late 1970s and early 1980s the species invasively spread in north and south america and nowadays spans about 15° latitude on each continent  <cit> . remarkably enough, latitudinal clines in the new world for inversion polymorphism and body size parallel to the long standing ones in the native geographic area were evident after a few years since the american colonization. this 'replicated time series experiment of evolution in action'  <cit>  strongly suggests that those traits are indeed subject to selection from temperature-related factors. however, a laboratory natural selection experiment  specifically designed to test the putative role of temperature per se in the evolution of these clines found results conflicting to those expected from the latitudinal gradients for both inversions and body size  <cit> . certainly, laboratory experiments are not the best way to mirror what is happening at different latitudes and to reconstruct natural clines. but at present it is unclear whether temperature alone drives the clines. what types of genetic changes are needed for an organism to adapt to new thermal conditions?

a number of authors  have argued that changes in the transcriptome constitute a major component of the genetic basis for phenotypic evolution. gene expression profiling by means of microarrays has become a popular way of finding candidate genes of trait variation and is providing new insights into some old but fundamental questions in evolutionary biology  <cit> . here we examine global gene expression by measuring the relative abundance of mrnas in third instar larvae of d. subobscura from 3-fold replicated laboratory thermal selection stocks -derived from the estimated chilean epicentre  of the original new world invasion  <cit> - that had evolved at three constant temperature regimes during  <dig> years: cold , optimum  and warm . the connection between the very high dimensional nature of the gene-expression data and the multivariate whole organism phenotype, however, is not straightforward and detailed functional and ecological analyses of candidate genes will obviously be required to understand the genetic basis for thermal adaptation .

in holometabolous insects like drosophila many adaptations to changing environments involve changes in larval behaviour and physiology that may impinge on other phases of the life cycle . for this reason we used third instar larvae for the microarray experiment. a possible drawback was that both sexes were mixed, so we have overlooked any sex-specific thermal response that might have been present. total mrna from each population was compared to a reference pool mrna independently derived from the optimum  populations  in a standard two-colour competitive hybridization using cdna microarrays with d. melanogaster clones  <cit> . heterologous hybridization to study gene expression profiles has been validated between closely related species , and consistent data are also obtained for less closely related taxa . drosophila subobscura belongs to the d. obscura group, and the divergence time between the d. melanogaster and d. obscura groups has been estimated to be ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . this apparently offers a reasonable warranty to use d. melanogaster arrays in heterologous hybridization with d. subobscura. in addition, we carried out some preliminary tests in order to optimize the experimental conditions. highly reproducible and consistent gene profiling, comparable to that obtained with homologous hybridization by using some d. subobscura clones added to the arrays , was observed.

it is also important to remark here that the lower and upper thermal regimes used in the experiment are not stressful: the temperature range likely covers much of the physiologically tolerable range in this species  <cit> . obviously, the constant thermal regimes and light:dark period where the populations have evolved  do not mirror the seasonal changes experience by natural populations, but with this experimental protocol we can control that temperature is the only factor differing between the thermal stocks. the thermal stocks had already diverged for inversion frequencies, pre-adult life history components, and morphological traits  <cit> . the experimental design equated to a four-way factorial analysis of variance  with thermal selection regime and cyanine dyes  in a flip dye design as fixed effects, replicated populations as a random factor nested in thermal selection regime, and slide  as a random factor nested in thermal selection, dye, and replicate. the analysis allowed identifying quantitative differences in larval gene expression between cold-  and warm-adapted  populations.

the candidate genes were assigned a biological function and/or biological process when information was available. also important, a number of genes were mapped by in situ hybridization to the polytene chromosomes of d. subobscura. the karyotype of this species consists of five acrocentric chromosomes and a dot chromosome . what is crucial here is that d. subobscura harbours one of the richest inversion polymorphisms in the genus, with a total of  <dig> chromosomal arrangements  recorded in the native palearctic region  <cit> . this number reduces to  <dig> arrangements in colonizing populations of the new world, all of them but one segregating in the thermal stocks  <cit> . variation in some traits is known to be tied to inversion polymorphisms in drosophila , and quantitative associations between larval gene expression and thermal adaptation could be due to position effects  or hitchhiking arisen from linkage disequilibrium. in view of the rapidly and consistently evolved latitudinal clines in chromosome inversion polymorphism following the new world invasion by the species  <cit> , and the shifts in inversion frequencies in response to laboratory thermal adaptation  <cit>  and to climate change  <cit> , we expect that a large number of genes will be included inside inverted chromosome segments. linkage with inversions will highly complicate the identification of chromosome regions that are targets of selection.

RESULTS
overall patterns of gene expression in the thermal lines
an important point in the experiment was that the parents of treatment larvae had also been reared at the same temperature of 18°c to control for the possibility of non-genetic parental effects on offspring . in order to generate a reliable data set we analyzed mrna abundance from a highly replicated experiment: four independent batches of  <dig> optimum-reared larvae each -amounting to  <dig>  larvae in total - whose mrnas were competitively hybridized to a reference pooled mrna from  <dig>  control larvae on contiguous duplicated gene spots using a dye-reversal experimental design, thus providing up to  <dig> gene expression values for each probe. furthermore, some genes were spotted  several times on the slides, which helped to confirm the quality and consistency of the data as there was a clear correspondence among different spots .

the distribution of normalized measures for valid relative gene expression levels in the g =  <dig>  cdna clones is shown in fig.  <dig>  all clones with less than  <dig> valid expression observations were excluded from further analyses and, therefore, we will only focus on the right part of fig.  <dig> just after the x-axis scale break. as a result,  <dig>  cdna clones  were allowed for differential gene expression analysis and their microarray signature, plotted as expression ratio versus fluorescence intensity, is shown in fig. 2a. for each clone g =  <dig>  ⋯,  <dig>  the dye-reversal experimental design was subjected to a least squares anova model as that shown in table  <dig> for  gene cg <dig>  a key premise in the experimental design with  <dig> degrees of freedom for the main fixed factor temperature was to define a priori the linear contrast between the two furthest apart thermal selection regimes: warm  vs. cold-adapted  populations .

temperature stands for the fixed effects due to thermal selection regime , replicate for the random effect of replicated populations  nested in thermal regime, dye for the fixed effect of cyanine dye cy <dig>  or cy <dig>  in the flip dye design, and slide for the random effect of cdna microarray glass slide nested in thermal regime, replicate and dye.

a error term for temperature and for the planned contrast comparing warm-  vs. cold-adapted  populations. b error term for replicate, dye, and temperature × dye interaction. c error term for slide.

a total of  <dig>  cdna clones were identified as 'differentially expressed' when considering a p-value  cut-off of 5% for the temperature factor with  <dig> degrees of freedom , but none of them was labelled as truly significant in terms of the false discovery rate  method used in detecting differential gene expression . on the other hand, from the permutation p-values obtained after the linear contrasts between the two furthest apart thermal selection regimes the number of 'differentially expressed genes' rose up to  <dig> , with  <dig>  remaining significant after a fdr correction . fig.  <dig> also shows the averages for the expression ratio versus fluorescence intensity of the identified  <dig> genes differing in gene expression , together with the corresponding box-plots . the reason why the linear contrasts comparing p <dig> vs. p <dig> populations yielded more differentially expressed genes was because the averages of log  <dig> relative intensity ratios for optimum  populations were normally in between the averages for p <dig> and p <dig> populations. therefore, a substantial proportion of the sum of squares for the temperature factor with  <dig> degrees of freedom in the anovas was accounted for by the linear contrast .

a far more informative plot is shown in fig.  <dig>  where gene expression values are sorted according to the contrast estimates. it is clear that those populations that have evolved at the optimum thermal regime  ranged in between, and that the average gene expression difference between warm- and cold-adapted populations was generally low: from  <dig>  for cg <dig>  to  <dig>  for cg <dig> .

gene expression grouped by cellular function and biological process
analysis of functional categories defined by the gene ontology project  <cit>  using the gotoolbox  <cit>  revealed that our reference dataset  includes  <dig> annotated genes, and only  <dig> out of  <dig> genes labelled as 'differentially expressed' were annotated. these genes could be assigned to different cellular or molecular functions: over two-thirds are involved in metabolism processes , in transport processes , and in regulation of transcription .  for each functional category, we compared the actual number of occurrences with the expected one under the null hypothesis that all categories should be equally represented. namely, the probability of obtaining by chance a number n of annotated genes for a given term among a dataset of size n, knowing that the reference dataset contains m such annotated genes out of g genes, is calculated. this test follows the hypergeometric distribution and the gotoolbox allows for fdr correction, pointing at statistically relevant over- or underrepresented terms within a dataset. the results obtained are shown in fig.  <dig> and indicate an overrepresentation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acids metabolism and regulation of transcription among other categories. two categories are apparently underrepresented: organic acid and carboxylic acid metabolism .

it seems reasonable that genetic adjustments to environmental differences may involve changes in metabolism. thus, when inbred and non-inbred d. melanogaster lines are reared under benign and stressful  environmental conditions gene expression patterns of metabolic genes are strongly affected by both inbreeding and temperature stress  <cit> . furthermore, previous studies on thermal evolution using the same drosophila species have shown that differences between cold- and warm-adapted populations can be due to differences in the efficiency of larval growth  <cit> . in our thermal stocks with d. subobscura we have shown that cold-adapted  populations had longer development times in the whole range of developmental temperatures assayed, and that warm-adapted  populations seem to have evolved faster development  <cit> . together with the lack of divergence for adult body size, it seems that cold-adapted d. subobscura stocks achieve the 'target' size by growing more slowly. this apparently agrees with their lower level of gene expression for genes involved in metabolic processes when compared to their warm-adapted counterparts.

candidate genes for thermotolerance in drosophila
expression levels for genes of the heat shock protein group  that act as molecular chaperones and are important for cellular housekeeping are known to covary with the thermal regimes experience by populations, species and higher taxa  <cit> . hsp <dig> appears to be the primary protein involved in thermotolerance in d. melanogaster  <cit>  -though apparently not in other drosophila species  <cit> -, and hsp <dig> allele frequencies show latitudinal clines and change in response to thermal evolution in the laboratory  <cit> . in addition, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> latitudinal variation in the d. melanogaster australian cline  <cit> , and correlated responses to selection for knockdown resistance at 39°c for hsp <dig>  <cit> , have also been found. besides hsps, other candidate genes for adaptation to thermal extremes  are: hsrω , hsf , tot , mth , dca , fst , drs , shark , anon-23da , desat <dig> , period , ddc , and various metabolic enzymes as adh , gpdh , gdh  and treh .

we had valid gene expression values  for all but  <dig> of the formerly listed genes; namely, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsf, fst, shark, anon-23da, period, ddc, gpdh , gdh and treh.  differential gene expression with the q-value cut-off chosen for the linear contrasts between cold-  and warm-adapted  populations was found only for hsp <dig>  which showed increased expression levels in p <dig> populations. however, the q-value thresholds for hsp <dig> , fst , and treh  were low enough as to suggest that these three candidate genes also diverged in gene expression levels in our populations.  it seems, therefore, that our survey in d. subobscura apparently links thermal adaptation in a temporally stable environment to some specific candidate genes  previously associated to thermotolerance in d. melanogaster. it is also worth saying that the hsp <dig> gene had a q-value threshold of  <dig>   and might have also been associated with thermal adaptation. on the other hand, hsp <dig> is known to be expressed during normal development in d. subobscura but increased transcription occurs when flies are reared at heat-shock temperatures from  <dig> to 34°c  <cit> . consistent with this finding we did not observe a statistically significant differential gene expression between cold- and warm-adapted populations for hsp <dig> .

mapping of differentially expressed genes by in situ hybridization and correlated expression patterns
in situ hybridizations to the polytene chromosomes were routinely carried out after crossing wild-type d. subobscura males with virgin females from the ch-cu marker strain. a total of  <dig> genes out of  <dig> differing in gene expression as concluded from the a priori contrasts were used as probes, and most of them  yielded hybridization signals . in all cases the negative results were due to failures in the amplifications. in no instance an exchange of genes among the different chromosomal elements of d. melanogaster and d. subobscura has been detected, which agrees with the well supported evidence for the established chromosomal homologies previously proposed for each muller/sturtevant/novitski element  <cit> . the order of genes within each chromosomal element, however, is known to have widely changed among different species via the fixation of paracentric inversions .

from the chromosomal homologies between d. melanogaster and d. subobscura  <cit> , and the distribution of the ~120-megabase euchromatic portion of the d. melanogaster genome on each chromosomal arm  <cit> , we tested the null hypothesis that the location of genes differing in gene expression between warm- and cold-adapted populations on the different d. subobscura chromosomes was at random . the g-test for goodness of fit  <cit>  detected a marginally nonsignificant random distribution , with chromosome j apparently being overrepresented and chromosome o underrepresented. it seems interesting to contrast these results with the previously reported chromosomal inversion shifts in the thermal populations  <cit> . inversions on chromosomes j, e and, to a lesser extent, chromosomes a and o showed clear shifts in frequency according to the thermal regime, whereas those on chromosome u showed no trend whatsoever. it is not at all evident how the distribution of the differentially expressed genes on chromosomes matches with these patterns as, for example, chromosome e and u are well represented in table  <dig> but their behaviour after two years of thermal evolution was completely different.

figs.  <dig>   <dig> show a schematic representation of the location of genes along the d. subobscura chromosomes, together with the chromosomal regions covered by the gene arrangements segregating in the thermal stocks. to test whether or not there is any clustering of genes within the inverted segments of the chromosomes we have relied on published tables where inversion lengths of d. subobscura are given as percentages of the total length of all chromosomes . since overlapping inversions in chromosomes u, e and o introduce potential confusion, we have only considered the following heterokaryotypes in the analysis: ast/a <dig>  jst/j <dig>  ust/u1+ <dig>  u1+2/u1+8+ <dig> , est/e1+2+ <dig>  e1+2+9/e1+2+9+ <dig>  e1+2+9/e1+2+9+ <dig>  ost/o3+ <dig>  o3+4/o3+4+ <dig> , and o3+4/o3+4+ <dig> . the g-test for goodness of fit detected a highly significant deviation from a random distribution  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), with all but o <dig> chromosome segments covered by inversions having a higher than expected number of genes.

we further analyzed the correlated expression levels in cold-  and warm-adapted  populations and compared the correlation matrices of gene expression levels between p <dig> and p <dig> populations with a mantel test  <cit>  by randomly permuting  <dig>  times the rows and columns of one of the matrices. for those physically mapped genes  the mantel tests showed that correlated patterns of expression were similar for all chromosomes . the same conclusion was also obtained when simultaneously comparing the correlation patterns of the  <dig> differently expressed genes .

to summarize, the physical mapping has shown that a larger than expected number of differentially expressed genes are located inside inverted chromosomal segments, and that the past thermal selection regime does not seem to have significantly changed the correlated patterns of gene expression. since inversions in d. subobscura are know to influence temporal patterns of linkage disequilibrium between allozymes  <cit> , disentangling the effects of inversions will be obviously required in any future approach if we want to identify the relevant candidate genes underlying thermal adaptation in d. subobscura.

CONCLUSIONS
by looking at changes in the transcriptome this study has identified a large number of genes that appear to be involved in thermal adaptation in drosophila subobscura, with a substantial fraction implicated in metabolism. interestingly, expression levels of four previously reported candidate genes for thermotolerance in drosophila  were found to be correlated with past thermal selection regime. the highest experimental temperature used in our stocks  was not expected to be stressful. this was apparently confirmed by the lack of induction in the p <dig> populations of a heat shock response known to occur in d. subobscura  <cit> . the data also suggest an association with polymorphic inversions as some clustering of genes within inverted chromosomal sections was detected. this result is probably not surprising in view of the rapidly evolved latitudinal clines in inversion frequencies after the introduction of the species into the new world  <cit> , as well as the quick response of inversion polymorphism to laboratory temperature  <cit> . the challenge now is to elucidate what associations are causal and what are due to correlated responses or hitchhiking arisen from linkage disequilibrium with the inversions.
