BACKGROUND
dicer <dig> gene encodes a protein containing rnase iii domains essential for mirna biogenesis. mirnas, which are 19- <dig> nucleotides long, non-coding rnas, regulate gene expression by binding to target mrnas in a sequence-specific manner, subsequently inhibiting their translation or inducing their degradation  <cit> . this post-transcriptional gene regulation machinery has been implicated in controlling diverse aspects of development in organisms from plants to mammals. in mice, general knockout  of dicer <dig> resulted in embryonic lethality around  <dig>  dpc  <cit> . inability of dicer <dig> ko embryonic stem cells to develop further highlights the role of mirna machinery in maintaining stem cell population at early developing stages. results from the tissue-specific ko of dicer <dig> gene in mice have demonstrated the importance of mirnas in organogenesis including heart, lung, limb and gonads  <cit> .

adrenal, testis, and ovary derive from a common primordium when they first arise in embryos. in the mouse embryo around  <dig>  dpc, cells in the adrenogonadal primordium start to express the orphan nuclear receptor sf <dig>   <cit> . between 10- <dig> dpc, the adrenogonadal primordium divides into adrenal primordium and gonadal primordium  <cit> . the sf1-positive cells eventually differentiate into the cortical cells of the adrenal, sertoli and leydig cells of the testis, and granulosa and theca cells of the ovary.

the shared origin of sf1-positive cells in adrenal and gonads raise the possibility that a common regulatory mechanism is present for the establishment or maintenance of these cell lineages. importance of dicer <dig> and mirnas has been documented in the adult testis and ovary  <cit> . in this study, we developed a mouse model in which dicer <dig> gene was inactivated specifically in the sf1-positive cells in the adrenogonadal primordium, allowing us to study the overall functions of mirnas in the development of adrenal, testis and ovary.

RESULTS
ablation of dicer <dig> in sf1-positive cells causes prenatal degeneration of the adrenal cortex
to investigate the functions of dicer <dig> in development of adrenals and gonads, we generated a conditional ko model in which dicer <dig> alleles were inactivated specifically in the sf1-positive cells, the precursors for cortical cells in the adrenals and somatic cells in the gonads  <cit> . the dicer1-floxed allele has been shown to be a null allele upon cre recombination in lung, limb, inner ear and germ cells  <cit> . the sf1/cre mouse line expresses high levels of cre recombinase in the adrenogonadal primordium at  <dig> dpc  <cit> . we and others have used this sf1/cre line to remove or activate genes in the adrenogonadal primordium and observed adrenal and gonadal phenotypes at as early as  <dig>  dpc  <cit> .

among the three organs  that derive from the sf1-positive adrenogonadal primordium, the adrenal was the first to show histological/morphological phenotypes in response to the loss of dicer <dig>  the dicer <dig> conditional knockout  adrenals were indistinguishable from the control adrenal  up to  <dig>  dpc. at  <dig>  dpc, the dicer <dig> ko adrenals were significantly smaller than the control and the decrease in size continued thereafter . at p <dig>  the size of ko adrenals was only 20%~30% of the control . the decreased adrenal size was not the result of general growth retardation based on the fact that the body weights of control and ko animals were not different . immunofluorescence for markers of adrenal cortex  and medulla  showed that the differentiation of cortex and medulla occurred properly in the ko adrenal compared to the control at  <dig>  dpc . however, as the adrenal development progressed, sf1-positive cells in the cortex were decreased in numbers and were almost completely lost at p <dig> . growth of the medulla was not affected in the ko adrenal over time, but loss of cortical cells resulted in direct contact between the medulla and the adrenal capsule in p <dig> ko mice .

to further examine the functions of the diminishing ko adrenal cortex, we analyzed the expression of the steroidogenic enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  by immunofluorescence. similar to the results of sf <dig> immunohistochemistry , the numbers of steroidogenic cortical cells were decreased at  <dig>  dpc and these cells almost completely disappeared by p <dig> . to investigate whether the loss of cortical cells resulted from increased cell death or reduced cell proliferation, we examined proliferation by staining for proliferation marker ki <dig> and apoptosis by tunel assay. we found no apparent changes in the number of ki67-positive cells in the ko cortex compared to the control . using the tunel assay to evaluate apoptosis, we observed an increase of tunel- and steroidogenic enzyme 21-hydroxylase -double positive cells in the ko adrenal cortex starting at  <dig>  dpc . in the control adrenal, only few tunel-positive cells in the cortex were observed during development . however in the ko cortex, significant increase in tunel-positive cells was observed at all time points . at p <dig>  few apoptotic cells remained in the ko adrenal where almost all cortical cells were lost at this stage. as a result of loss of adrenal cortex, none of the dicer <dig> ko animals survived beyond p <dig> 

ablation of dicer <dig> in the sf1-positive cells causes testis degeneration after birth
ablation of dicer <dig> mediated by sf1/cre inactivates dicer <dig> not only in the adrenal but also in the somatic cells of fetal testes and ovaries. although sf1/cre was activated in the adrenogonadal primordium, the ko testis did not show any abnormality during fetal life. sertoli cell differentiation and testis cord formation in the fetal testes were comparable between control and ko as indicated by sox <dig> staining . at the time of birth or p <dig>  no morphological differences were found in the ko testis and epididymis . at p <dig> and p <dig>  the size of the ko testis remained similar to that at p <dig> while the size of the control testis increased over time . testis cords, as outlined by staining for laminin, started to degenerate at p <dig> in the ko testis and by p <dig>  only few testis cords were observed .

to investigate how loss of dicer <dig> in the sf1-positive cells affects differentiation of somatic cells and germ cells in the testis, we examined markers specific for sertoli cells , germ cells   <cit> , steroidogenic leydig cells , and the proliferation marker ki <dig> . no significant differences were observed in ko testis at p <dig> compared to the control. at p <dig>  the number of testis cords in the ko testis was decreased . we also observed a decrease in the number of proliferating sertoli cells inside the testis cords . at p <dig>  ko testes lost most of the testis cord structures and few cords were present. dicer <dig> depletion affected not only testis cords but also leydig cells in the interstitium. at p <dig>  most of the hsd3b-positive leydig cells disappeared and no leydig cells were found at p <dig> . it is known that leydig cells at this stage are mitotically inactive ; therefore, the decrease in leydig cell number was probably not the result of proliferation problems.

to examine whether the degeneration of the ko testis results from increased cell death, we performed immunofluorescence for cleaved caspase- <dig> , a marker for apoptosis. no casp3-positive cells were found in the control testes during development . in contrast, the ko testes had significant numbers of casp3-positive cells starting at  <dig>  dpc and becoming prominent at p <dig> and p <dig> . by double staining with the germ cell marker tra <dig> or the basement membrane marker laminin, we found that most of the casp3-positive cells in p <dig> ko testes belonged to tra98-negative sertoli cells inside the testis cords and cells in the interstitium . at p <dig>  casp <dig> staining was observed in both tra98-positive germ cells and tra98-negative sertoli cells inside the testis cords  and only few casp3-positive cells were found in the interstitium .

ablation of dicer <dig> does not disturb fetal and neonatal development of the ovary
targeted gene deletion mediated by sf1/cre transgene occurs in all sf1-positive tissues, including the ovary  <cit> . in our lab, the aforementioned sf1/cre transgenic mouse line was used successfully to inactivate beta-catenin in the fetal ovary  <cit> . we analyzed the dicer <dig> ko ovary mediated by the same sf1/cre at fetal stages and up to p <dig> and found no differences in morphology and marker expression between control and ko ovaries . at p <dig>  the size, staining patterns of cell specific markers , and markers for proliferation  and apoptosis  were indistinguishable between wt and ko ovaries .

discussion
in the sf1/cre-mediated dicer <dig> ko mice, adrenal cortical cells are the first sf1-positive population that undergoes apoptosis at fetal stages, followed by testicular leydig cells and sertoli cells, respectively. adrenal degeneration in the dicer <dig> ko starts between  <dig> - <dig>  dpc and by the time of birth, adrenal cortical cells are almost completely abolished. in the testis, however, degeneration becomes apparent only after birth and progresses rapidly. loss of somatic cells in the testes eventually leads to germ cells loss in the dicer <dig> ko testis. by p <dig>  almost all of the functional structures and cell types in the testis are no longer present. intriguingly, ovaries, which derive from the same sf1-positive primordium as adrenal and testis, show no morphological and cellular changes from fetal stages to p <dig> in response to the loss of dicer <dig>  increased apoptosis has been reported in tissues that lack dicer <dig>  <cit> . increased cell death in testes and adrenals in our study further suggests that dicer <dig> and micrornas processed by dicer play a universal role in maintaining cell survival.

in the adrenal, the cortical cells are derived from at least two sources: 1) the sf1-positive adrenal primordium, which forms the foundation of the organ and 2) sf1-negative capsular cells, which contribute to further growth of the adrenocortex  <cit> . it is known that loss of sf <dig> leads to apoptosis of adrenal cortical cells and adrenal dysgenesis at birth  <cit> . loss of dicer <dig> in the sf1-positive cortical cells also leads to apoptosis of the cortex; however, the degeneration process occurs much later than that in the case of sf <dig> ko. it is possible that dicer-regulated mirnas control genes that are critical for cortical cells survival, such as sf <dig>  however, in the dicer <dig> ko adrenal, sf <dig> is still present in the remaining cortical cells. depletion or mutation of cited <dig>  wt <dig>  and pbx <dig> also resulted in prenatal adrenal dysgenesis in mouse embryos  <cit> . involvement of dicer and mirnas in regulation of these genes in adrenal development remains to be determined.

adrenocortical degeneration was also reported in β-catenin conditional ko mice  <cit> . β-catenin deficiency mediated by the same sf1/cre resulted in underdeveloped adrenal cortex; however, no apoptosis was found at fetal stages. these data suggest that regulation of adrenal development via β-catenin is probably independent from dicer-regulated mirna machinery or vice versa.

dicer and other components of the mirna-mediated interference machinery are present in the testis, including germ cells and sertoli cells  <cit> . germ cell-specific dicer <dig> ko mice were generated using the tnap/cre that is active in the primordial germ cells  <cit> . loss of dicer <dig> in germ cells led to defects in proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia and abnormal morphology and motility of sperm  <cit> . sertoli cell-specific dicer <dig> ko mice was generated using the anti-müllerian hormone cre  line that targets sertoli cells starting at ~ <dig>  dpc  <cit> . loss of dicer <dig> in sertoli cells resulted in impaired spermatogenic waves and complete absence of spermatozoa. in addition, increased sertoli cell apoptosis was found at p <dig> and germ cells underwent apoptosis at p <dig>  eventually leading to complete testis degeneration at p <dig>  in our sf1/cre-mediated dicer <dig> ko model, we targeted both sertoli cells and leydig cells at an earlier stage . we observed testicular degeneration at an earlier time point and in a more dramatic fashion than was reported in the sertoli cell dicer <dig> ko. in our model, almost all testicular structures and cell types were absent at p <dig>  as expected, both sertoli and leydig cell populations underwent apoptosis albeit within different time frames . although male germ cells are negative for sf <dig>  their survival was affected in the somatic cell-specific dicer <dig> ko testis. this is expected as sertoli cells are known to provide structural supports and differentiation cues to support spermatogenesis  <cit> . although leydig cells were also affected in our model, we do not believe that their demise is responsible for the germ cell loss phenotypes based on the fact that male germ cells are not known to respond to androgens, the major product of leydig cells.

dicer <dig> is also expressed in the female reproductive tract and the ovary, including oocytes, theca cells and granulosa cells  <cit> . many mirnas are synthesized in ovaries at different stages of folliculogenesis  <cit> . it has been reported that morphogenesis and function of the female reproductive tract were affected in the absence of dicer <dig>  <cit> . to study the in vivo role of dicer <dig> in the mouse ovary, granulosa cell specific dicer <dig> ko mice were generated by using amhr2/cre, which is expressed in granulosa cells of preantral and antral follicles  <cit> . two different dicer1-floxed strains were used and both showed that loss of dicer <dig> in granulosa cells resulted in decreased ovulation rate, trapped oocytes in luteinized follicles and increased numbers of atretic follicles  <cit> . fertilized oocytes collected from granulosa cell-specific dicer <dig> ko females had decreased ability to progress to the two-cell stage  <cit> . we were not able to examine the consequence of loss of dicer <dig> on folliculogenesis due to death of dicer <dig> ko animals after p <dig> as a result of adrenal cortex degeneration. however at least at p <dig>  dicer <dig> ko ovaries show no signs of degeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
based on findings from our lab and others, sf1/cre-medicated gene deletion occurs in adrenals and gonads at 10- <dig> dpc. in the sf1/cre-mediated dicer <dig> ko embryos, defects in adrenals and testes did not become apparent until  <dig>  dpc and p <dig>  respectively, and the ovaries were not affected. the extended delay between deletion of dicer and the appearance of phenotypes suggests that dicer and/or micrornas have a substantial half-life  <cit> . it also raises the possibilities that  these organs have different turn-over rate of dicer and/or dicer-induced micrornas,  these three organs have different thresholds of tolerance toward the loss of dicer <dig> and micrornas, and/or  dicer and micrornas play tissue-specific roles among these three organs. in the sertoli cell-specific dicer <dig> ko testis, the significant alternations in gene expression have already occurred at the time when structural changes are not yet detectable. we are currently testing these three possibilities by performing a time course analysis of changes in dicer <dig> mrna, dicer protein and micrornas in these three tissues after dicer <dig> ablation.
