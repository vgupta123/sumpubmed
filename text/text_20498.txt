BACKGROUND
tomato is an important vegetable crop contributing pro-vitamin a and vitamin c to the human diet and providing high economic value to producers. tomato has also been extensively used as a model organism for basic studies in plant biology, with a focus on resistance to pests, plant development, and biochemical pathways. as a result, extensive genetic and genomic resources have been developed. in the early 1990's, a high-resolution genetic map was constructed using more than  <dig>  rflp markers between solanum lycopersicum and a wild relative, s. pennellii  <cit> . the first plant resistance  gene to be isolated and cloned, pto conferring resistance to the bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, was characterized via map-based cloning in tomato  <cit> . to date, several other r-genes from tomato have been cloned including genes conferring resistance to fungal , insect , and viral  pathogens  <cit> . genes regulating growth habit  and fruit development  have also been cloned and characterized  <cit> . genome sequencing projects are adding new resources for genetic analysis. recently, large-scale sequencing of tomato ests identified  <dig> potential simple sequence repeats  and  <dig> pcr-based polymorphic markers that were mapped on the s. lycopersicum × s. pennellii reference population  <cit> .

during and following domestication, tomato has undergone intensive selection and cultivated varieties have narrow genetic diversity relative to other crops. this narrow diversity makes it difficult to identify molecular markers that are polymorphic in modern breeding material. for instance, of the  <dig> putative ssrs that were identified based on bioinformatic screening of est databases, only  <dig> are polymorphic in cultivated tomato  <cit>  and only  <dig> to  <dig> of these ssrs are polymorphic within a given cross . the low level of polymorphism has resulted in a limited application of marker-assisted selection  in populations derived from elite by elite crosses due to a scarcity of markers. in order to identify enough markers for genetic mapping and mas, genome wide approaches to screening for markers must be adopted.

single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most common type of sequence variation and tend to be biallelic in plant species  <cit> . new methods for snp detection are facilitating high-throughput genotyping, and provide strong motivation for the identification of sequence variation. in tomato, an in silico approach for snp discovery was employed utilizing publicly available est sequences  <cit> . this study identified  <dig>  contigs with three est sequences from each of two s. lycopersicum varieties, rio grande and ta <dig>  one snp was detected for every  <dig>  bp analyzed, with  <dig> candidate snps in  <dig> genes. this strategy was limited by the predominance of ta <dig> sequences in the est databases at the time. a second strategy to facilitate snp discovery was developed based on conserved orthologous set  introns  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  snps were detected in  <dig> loci among  <dig> tomato varieties . of these,  <dig> snps in  <dig> loci were polymorphic within elite material. snps were detected in the cos introns at a rate  <dig>  fold higher than in coding regions. these studies suggest that sufficient polymorphism exists in tomato to expand mas to elite by elite crosses, but the primary limitation is the development of efficient methods to identify large numbers of snps.

a high-throughput approach based on an oligonucleotide array was proposed to identify sequence polymorphism including snps and insertion/deletions  in haploid yeast  <cit> . borevitz et al  <cit>  referred to polymorphisms discovered from array hybridizations as single feature polymorphisms  and identified nearly  <dig>  potential sfps between two arabidopsis varieties, columbia  and landsberg erecta . array-based sfp detection has been applied to several plant species including barley  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and cowpea  <cit> .

in the present study, we report sfp discovery using oligonucleotide arrays hybridized with genomic dnas from three s. lycopersicum varieties representing fresh-market, processing, and cherry  for marker development that will benefit both geneticists and breeders. we verified  <dig> sfps in  <dig> loci and conducted a genetic diversity analysis using  <dig> tomato varieties and accessions with  <dig> loci discovered from the arrays.

RESULTS
prediction and validation of sfps
we called putative sfps from two-way comparisons between the fresh-market variety fl <dig> and the processing genotype oh <dig> , between the cherry accession pi <dig> and fl <dig> , and between pi <dig> and oh <dig>  using a regression based method at six levels of significance from α = 10- <dig> to α = 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig> sfps were selected for sequence validation. high quality sequence data covering the target sfp probe regions were obtained for  <dig> of these, while partial sequences that did not extend into the target regions were obtained for an additional  <dig> loci. validation rates were determined based on the  <dig> sfps . the validation rates for six ci levels were 60% , 63% , 71% , 74% , 76% , and 75% . validation rate reached a plateau between α ≤ 10- <dig> and α ≤ 10- <dig> . although validation rates increased, at higher ci there was a reduction in the rate of known sfps called . at α ≤ 10- <dig>  11% of known polymorphism were excluded. this rate increased to 17% at α ≤ 10- <dig>  23% at α ≤ 10- <dig>  32% at α ≤ 10- <dig>  and 47% at α ≤ 10- <dig>  the increase in type ii error leads to a wide range in the estimate of the number of sfps for the six ci levels from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

sfp based discovery of snps and indels
a total of  <dig> snps and five indels were detected in the target probe regions. an additional  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were identified in sequences flanking probes identified as sfps. thus, a total of  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were identified in  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which contained at least one snp and one of which contained only indels . these sequence polymorphisms were not evenly distributed among loci as multiple snps  were identified in  <dig> loci including  <dig> loci with  <dig> snps,  <dig> loci with  <dig> snps,  <dig> loci with  <dig> snps, and  <dig> loci with ≥  <dig> snps . an example of a single locus, le <dig>  containing multiple snps is shown in figure  <dig>  this locus  encodes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase that is presumably involved in the ethylene biosynthetic process. the alignment of sequences from three varieties at this locus showed two snps at the target sfp probe position and an additional snp located 5' of the probe. two varieties, fl <dig> and pi <dig> share a common haplotype at this locus, while oh <dig> has a second haplotype . further analysis indicates that the second snp  in the probe sequence is a non-synonymous substitution  while the other two snps  are synonymous substitutions.

genetic diversity in tomato germplasm
in order to evaluate the utility of snps discovered from array hybridization and subsequent sequence validation, we used  <dig> markers to genotype a collection of  <dig> tomato varieties and accessions representing different market uses and origins  . we tested the hypothesis that these groups, based on origin and breading history, represent genetic subpopulations. to assess whether breeding practices have affected how variation is partitioned between the groups, we estimated pairwise θ  according to weir and cockerham  <cit>  using the msa software package  <cit> . pairwise estimates of θ ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between s. pimpinellifolium and the four cultivated groups of s. lycopersicum  indicating a high level of differentiation between cultivated tomato and this wild relative. the processing varieties represented a distinct subpopulation relative to fresh-market , vintage , and landrace  entries included in the analysis. fresh-market varieties represented a distinct subpopulation relative to vintage  and landrace  . expected heterozygosity, the probability of selecting two alleles at random from each subpopulation  <cit> , was estimated across all  <dig> loci as  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for fresh-market,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for processing,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for vintage,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for landrace, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for s. pimpinellifolium.

allele-based analysis of the  <dig> marker loci and haplotype-based analysis using five additional loci detected variation  within the fresh-market varieties for  <dig> of  <dig> loci . for  <dig> out of the  <dig> loci polymorphic in the fresh-market varieties, allelic variation was also present among the processing varieties. the two exceptions were le <dig> and le <dig>  the most common fresh-market alleles were present in a lower frequency for le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  and le <dig> in the processing germplasm. additional allelic variation  was detected in the processing varieties at le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig> and le <dig>  but these loci were monomorphic in the fresh-market germplasm. of the  <dig> loci that were polymorphic within elite germplasm, we detected only a single allele  in the vintage and landrace varieties for  <dig> loci . in contrast, six loci  contained allelic variation within the vintage or landrace varieties, but not in the fresh-market and processing varieties.

the  <dig> varieties of s. lycopersicum  showed no allelic variation for  <dig> loci: le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le000035s, le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  le <dig>  and le <dig> . the four accessions of s. pimpinellifolium, however, showed allelic variation  for these  <dig> loci and  <dig> other loci.

of  <dig> loci with snps,  <dig> loci contained four or more polymorphisms. we included four additional loci that correspond to leoh ests with >  <dig> snps  <cit>  and, as a control, the rcr <dig> gene, which is required for cf- <dig> resistance and is thought to be under diversifying selection  <cit> . we considered these genes to be highly polymorphic and were interested in addressing whether they might contain an unusual number of changes that could modify protein function. we eliminated all loci with indel polymorphisms, and the remaining set of  <dig> loci was used to estimate the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous substitutions . estimates of the ka/ks ratio for the  <dig> loci ranged from  <dig>  to >  <dig>  . the values for le <dig>  and le <dig>  are in the same range estimated for rcr <dig> . the sequences for le <dig> , le <dig> , le <dig> , le <dig> , le <dig> , and le <dig>  had values that approach or exceed  <dig>  these loci have a higher than expected number non-synonymous changes.

discussion
array-based sfp discovery proved to be a high-throughput approach to develop new molecular markers for genetics and breeding in tomato. we used genomic dna as a hybridization target to detect sfps on an affymetrix  array. validation rate leveled off between 71%  and 75%  for predicted sfps between three cultivated tomato varieties. however, using α values between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> resulted in a high percentage of known sfps within probe features being excluded.

our empirically determined estimate of the efficiency of random sequencing in cultivated tomato is  <dig> % snp discovery on a per gene  basis, an estimate that is influenced by the 1/ <dig>  bp occurrence of polymorphism and the unequal distribution of polymorphism within genes  <cit> . a random sequencing approach is therefore highly inefficient for snp discovery within cultivated tomato. the efficiency of random sequencing would increase to 18%-19% on a per gene basis if non-coding sequences were targeted  <cit> . the use of array hybridization to improve the rate of sfp validation to over 70% represents a dramatic improvement in efficiency relative to random sequencing.

the complexity of the target, the method of detection , and stringency of probability impact validation rate. complexity of the target is dependent on whether cdna  or genomic dna is used and on genome size when genomic dna is the target. using mrna as a hybridization target has been used to reduce the complexity of large plant genomes. this approach, however, adds other issues due to presence of multi-gene families, variation in the level of expression, and post-transcriptional sequence polymorphism  <cit> . the robustified projection pursuit  method has been developed as a way to improve sfp detection with fewer biological replicates  <cit> . projection pursuit analyses also perform well under a range of distributions  <cit> , a feature that is of particular importance to hybridizations using mrna target where the range of expression must be considered. using rpp and selecting probes with overall outlying scores  from the 5% distribution tail, the validation rate in barley was 80%  <cit> . using the same method for cowpea, but selecting u from the 15% distribution resulted in a validation rate of 67%  <cit> . thus, the stringency of selection is a key feature of increasing reducing false discovery rate. sfp detection accuracy for which known snp genotypes are predicted from mrna hybridizations are reported to be as high as 95% when multiple methods are used  <cit> . these values drop to ~80% when a single method is used  <cit> . our detection of sfps using dna as the target was less sensitive than similar studies in a. thaliana   <cit> . we attribute this difference to the complexity of the target, which is approximately  <dig> mb for tomato and  <dig> mb for a. thaliana. our validation rate was comparable to the 75% found for rice, which has a genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . increasing the stringency  decreased the false discovery rate while increasing type ii error, an observation that is expected. values of α between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> provided the best balance between false discovery and eliminating true polymorphisms.

the snps discovered from array hybridization provided a tool to both estimate θ  and inspect allele distribution within and between groups in order to assess the affects of selection during the breeding history of cultivated tomato. selection of individuals with favorable mutations during domestication and through breeding practices has led to a reduction of genetic diversity in crop species  <cit> . a narrow genetic base has previously been reported in cultivated tomato  <cit> . it is postulated that genetic bottlenecks occurred during domestication and during the introduction of tomato to europe from latin america by spanish explorers  <cit> . the patterns of lower snp variation we observed in vintage and landrace groups relative to wild tomatoes document a genetic bottleneck. however, breeding practices have stressed the introgression of new genetic variation, especially for disease resistance from wild species  <cit> . tomato breeding for fresh-market and processing varieties diverged with a strong emphasis on distinct ideotypes reinforced by the initiation of mechanical harvest. efforts to develop tomatoes specifically for mechanical harvest were initiated in  <dig>  but did not produce acceptable varieties until the mid 1960s  <cit> . given the historical practices of tomato breeding that include introgression and market differentiation, we hypothesize that genetic differentiation may have occurred between varietal classifications and that elite germplasm may contain more variation relative to landrace and vintage varieties. our pairwise estimates of θ between the five subpopulations representing fresh-market, processing, vintage, landrace, and s. pimpinellifolium strongly suggest genetic differentiation has occurred due to breeding. furthermore within subpopulation estimates of genetic diversity provide evidence that modern breeding practices have broadened the genetic diversity of tomato relative to landrace and vintage varieties. these results are consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

we also investigated whether a subset of highly polymorphic  genes might contain functional changes. we identified six loci with high ratios of non-synonymous substitution relative to our control gene. proteins encoded by these genes include, a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c , a cytochrome p <dig> , a fertility restorer-like protein , a ubiquinol-cytochrome c chaperone protein , and two proteins of unknown function . these genes may be candidates for functional analysis in order to identify genes that contribute to existing phenotypic variation in crop plants.

plant genomes have evolved under human selection. perhaps the best-documented consequence of this selection is a reduction of variation caused by genetic bottlenecks during the domestication process and through selective sweeps due to linkage to genes that are desirable in agriculture  <cit> . much of what we currently know about the genes that were selected during domestication and breeding derive from the map-based cloning of individual genes. selection has often been toward loss-of-function mutations. examples include the loss of seed dispersal in grains through shattering  <cit>  and loss of branching  <cit> . at the same time, some desirable phenotypes are due to gain of function mutations. examples include disease resistance  <cit> , high beta-carotene content in tomato which is conferred by a promoter mutation leading to increased expression of the fruit-specific beta-cyclase  <cit> , and elongated fruit shape due to the duplication, translocation, and subsequent over-expression of an iq <dig> domain-containing gene in tomato fruit  <cit> .

the idea that algorithms might be applied for the high throughput identification of the genes selected during crop improvement has been proposed for a number of plant species. the application of such approaches is somewhat crop specific, and is influenced by mating system and rates of polymorphism. in highly diverse species, such as maize, the focus has been to identify selective sweeps  <cit> . however in crops that have experienced severe genetic bottlenecks it will be difficult to distinguish selective sweeps from the effects of genetic drift due to the bottlenecks themselves. on the other hand, species with reduced genetic variation might offer a model to detect genes with increased levels of polymorphism. arguably, these are the genes that are of most interest to plant breeders as they likely contribute to existing phenotypic variation. in the case of tomato, an obstacle will be to distinguish genes that are associated with introgressions due to linkage disequilibrium from the selected genes themselves.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that sfp discovery using an oligonucleotide array is an efficient way to develop a large number of markers that may be used for high-resolution genetic mapping and marker-assisted breeding in elite tomato germplasm. the snps and indels detected in this study can be a useful resource for haplotyping and population genetic studies. we combined the identification of genetic variation within genes with methods to investigate the effects of selection on cultivated tomato. these methods included genetic diversity analysis to detect genes with unequal distribution between five subpopulations; and finally, an analysis of substitution rates was applied to genes with multiple polymorphisms to identify genes in which sequence variation may have functional consequences. we conclude that breeding has increased genetic diversity in modern tomatoes relative to vintage tomato varieties that were selected prior to the widespread application of mendelian principles to breeding  <cit> . our analysis identified some alleles in vintage varieties that have apparently been lost in modern tomatoes. however such reductions in genetic variation are offset by an overall increase in allelic diversity in both fresh-market and processing varieties. based on the frequent presence of these "new" alleles and haplotypes in wild relatives of cultivated tomato, we conclude that increased allelic diversity is most likely due to the purposeful introgression from wild species.
