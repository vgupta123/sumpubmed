BACKGROUND
anaplasma phagocytophilum is a tick-transmitted pathogen causing granulocytic anaplasmosis in human , equine and canine granulocytic anaplasmosis and tick-borne fever in ruminants  <cit> . the epidemiology of a. phagocytophilum is closely related to the ecology of its main vector, namely the hard tick of the ixodes genus. the most representative vectors include i. ricinus in europe, i. persulcatus in asia, i. scapularis in eastern and mid-western united states and i. pacificus in california  <cit> . although their vectorial implication has not been evidenced, a. phagocytophilum has also been detected in non-ixodes hard ticks, such as boophilus, dermacentor, hyalomma, and rhipicephalus <cit> . the bacterium is transstadially transmitted by the vector ticks but there is no evidence of transovarial transmission  <cit> . therefore, both mammalian reservoirs and vector ticks are essential for the cycle maintenance of a. phagocytophilum.

in europe, wild cervids in particular roe deer  are recognized as competent hosts for a. phagocytophilum <cit> . the presence of this bacterium has also been reported in other wild animals, such as birds and rodents  <cit>  but the whole range of animal species reservoirs for this bacterium in natural environment is still unknown. the presence of a. phagocytophilum in wild boars has been documented in several eastern european countries  <cit> , and also in japan  <cit> . however, the role of wild boars in the epidemiology of a. phagocytophilum is not fully elucidated.

in belgium as in other european countries, a steady increase of wild boar populations has been observed over the last twenty years. from  <dig> to  <dig>  according to the official census of the department of nature and forestry, the estimated hunting bags of wild boar in southern belgium  increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  heads  <cit> . the higher abundance of wildlife and the increased contact between wildlife, domestic animals and human populations raises the risk for outbreaks of tick borne diseases, and then the difficulty of implementing surveillance and control measures  <cit> .

the granulocytic anaplasmosis due to a. phagocytophilum is the most widespread tick borne infection in animals  <cit> . although the disease is known quite a long time in veterinary medicine, the observed increasing number of clinical and/or asymptomatic cases of hga during the two last decades mainly in united states  <cit>  but also in europe, has generated growing public health interest in this zoonosis. recently, cochez and co-workers reported  <dig> confirmed cases of hga between  <dig> and  <dig> in belgium  <cit> . despite interest for this pathogen, epidemiological data are scarse and there is few informations concerning a. phagocytophilum infections in wild boars in western europe, even though they are one of the most abundant big game species.

therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of infection with a. phagocytophilum in the wild boar population in southern belgium using pcr targeting gene coding for the 16s ribosomal rna.

RESULTS
within  <dig> spleens tested,  <dig> samples were tested positive and confirmed to be infected with a. phagocytophilum corresponding of ce <dig> , and dama  <dig>  strains by sequencing analysis. this prevalence of  <dig> %  in wild boars is surprisingly low compared to that previously detected in roe deer  collected in the same region  <cit> . this discrepancy is also reported in other european studies. wild cervids are important hosts for i. ricinus, the main vector of a. phagocytophilum. these species, especially roe deer, are largely infected by this bacterium  <cit> . in certain regions of germany, the prevalence of a. phagocytophilum in roe deer reached 95%  <cit>  and even 100%  <cit> . the role of these ungulates as competent reservoir for a. phagocytophilum is established  <cit> .

regarding wild boars, the situation is less clear. as in the present study, a. phagocytophilum has been reported with low prevalence in other countries such as the czech republic  <cit> , slovenia  <cit>  and romania  <cit>  with rates of infection of  <dig> to 4%. higher prevalences were detected in wild boars sampled in poland  and in the czech republic  in region close to the austrian border  <cit> . in contrast, studies performed in austria and north of spain failed to detect any infected boars by a. phagocytophilum <cit> . this low prevalence in wild boars supports the hypothesis that these animals can be naturally infected but capable to control infection. one of the pathways for controlling a. phagocytophilum infection may be the activation of innate immune responses and cytoskeleton rearrangement in order to promote phagocytosis and autophagy  <cit> .

a. phagocytophilum is a single species but there is a genetic heterogeneity within the species and many closely related strains are described that differ in vectors, host preferences, geographical distribution but also pathogenicity  <cit> . all strains circulating in wild hosts are not infectious for humans. as an example, the main reservoir for human pathogenic strains in north america is the white-footed mouse  while the white-tailed deer  is reservoir for strains non infective for humans  <cit> . in europe, cervids harbor mostly a. phagocytophilum strains that are not detected in humans  <cit>  but one study  <cit>  reported that red deer may be infected with strains infectious for humans. interestingly, human pathogenic strains of a. phagocytophilum have been detected in wild boars in slovenia, poland and the czech republic, suggesting that these ungulates may represent a potential reservoir for strains associated with hga  <cit> . further studies are needed to elucidate the role of wild boars in the epidemiology of a. phagocytophilum and to determine if strains detected in wild boars in belgium are human-pathogenic strains.

CONCLUSIONS
our data show that wild boars can be naturally infected by a. phagocytophilum in southern belgium. the low prevalence infection detected in the present work is in accordance with results from previous studies and suggest that wild boars could play a less important role than cervids as reservoir for a. phagocytophilum. however, as they are particularly abundant, if they were found to harbor strains pathogenic to humans, they may represent a significant source of infection for people carrying out outdoor activities.
