BACKGROUND
the primary aim of t cell development is to create a fully competent t lymphocyte population in the periphery, capable of quickly identifying pathogens yet non-responsive to self-tissue  <cit> . to maintain this delicate balance, the immature thymocytes are subjected to rigorous control, where signaling through the t cell receptor  is of utmost importance  <cit> . mature, peripheral t cells are equally dependent on the tcr, as activation and effector cell development are decided by tcr signaling strength and duration  <cit> .

upon receptor engagement, a host of adaptor and effector proteins assemble at numerous phosphotyrosines within the cytoplasmic segment of the tcr signaling complex. among the key players in this signaling system are the adaptors slp <dig>  <cit>  and linker for activation of t cells   <cit> , their association with the activated tcr and their subsequent phosphorylation that activates signaling through phospholipase c-γ   <cit> , as well as ras and the rho family of gtpases  <cit> , which in turn enable activation of more distal pathways such as the various variants of mitogen activated kinases   <cit> . loss of early signaling elements, such as lat or slp <dig> therefore has profound effects on t cell development and function, with an almost complete block at the very first thymocyte development step requiring tcr signaling, the β- selection, and with severely impaired peripheral responses as a consequence  <cit> .

shb is a widely expressed adaptor protein, known to associate with a variety of different tyrosine kinases, including receptors important for hematopoiesis in general and lymphopoiesis in particular, including the activated tcr, vegfr-  <dig> and pdgfr  <cit> . in the case of tcr signaling, the sh2-domain of shb binds to the ζ-chain of the cd <dig> complex, where it partakes in the lat- slp <dig> signaling complex  <cit> . shb has been demonstrated to associate with both lat and slp <dig>  and to facilitate the phosphorylation of numerous downstream signaling targets such as vav- <dig> and plc-γ, accordingly playing an important role in proper tcr signal transduction  <cit> .

a shb knockout mouse has recently been generated. no viable shb knockout offspring could be generated on the c57bl/ <dig> background owing to an early embryonic defect. however shb null mice were obtained on a mixed background   <cit> . the animals display abnormalities in their reproduction, vasculature and glucose homeostasis  <cit> . we employed the shb knockout to assess thymus and t cell function. although early t cell development appears unaffected, we observe hyperproliferation and a skewing towards a th <dig> response in peripheral t cells.

methods
animals
the generation of shb knockout mice has been described previously  <cit> . the animals were bred on a mixed background . all experiments were approved by the local animal ethics committee at uppsala university.

cell preparation
freshly isolated thymi and spleens were gently crushed through a  <dig> μm cell strainer  and thereafter treated with red cell lysis buffer  in order to remove erythrocytes.

flow cytometry
for flow cytometry  <dig> ×  <dig> cells in a final volume of  <dig> μl 1% bsa in pbs were stained with the following antibodies cd4-fitc, cd8-fitc, cd4-pe-cy <dig>  cd8- pe, cd44-pe-cy <dig>  cd25-pe, and cd62l-pe . flow cytometry was performed on a facscalibur  using cellquest software .

tcr stimulation
single cell suspensions with  <dig> ×  <dig> thymocytes or  <dig> ×  <dig> splenocytes in rpmi  <dig>  supplemented with 10% fbs and  <dig> μm β-mercaptoethanol  were stimulated with cd3-antibody  at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml in 37°c. thymocytes were stimulated for either  <dig> or  <dig> minutes whereas splenocytes were stimulated for  <dig> minutes.

immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
cell lysates were prepared by addition of lysis buffer . immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the samples with either α-phosphotyrosine antibody  or with shb antibody  <cit>  at  <dig>  μg/ml or  <dig> μg/ml, respectively, for  <dig> hour at 4°c. this was followed by incubation with protein a sepharose  under the same conditions. samples were washed  <dig> times in lysis buffer and resuspended in sds-sample buffer.

protein denaturation was achieved by boiling the samples for  <dig> minutes followed by separation on sds- page. proteins were transferred to hybond-p membranes  and subsequently blocked in 5% bsa over night at 4°c.immunodetection the membranes were probed with the following antibodies: α-phosphotyrosine , phospho-erk , plcγ , c-cbl , vav <dig> , phospho-p <dig> , zap <dig> , p <dig> , shb and erk . immunodetection was performed using hrp-conjugated secondary antibodies  and ecl detection solution  according to manufacturer's instructions. the autoradiographic film  was afterwards exposed to the membrane for  <dig> seconds up to  <dig> minutes, depending on the strength of the signal.

t cell purification, proliferation and cytokine production assay
single cell suspensions of splenocytes were fractioned into either cd4+ or cd8+ cells or into naïve cd4+ cells using macs magnetic microbeads , following the manufacturer's instructions.  <dig> ×  <dig> cd4+ or cd8+ splenocytes were plated on 24-well plates precoated with  <dig>  μg/ml α-cd <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml α-cd <dig> antibodies  in a volume of  <dig>  ml f-dmem  supplemented with 10% fbs and  <dig> μm β-mercaptoethanol. supernatants were harvested every  <dig> hours for  <dig> days and cytokine production was estimated by sandwich immunoassays using gyrolab bioaffy  following the manufacturer's instructions  <cit> . on the fourth day of stimulation, 10% of the cells were incubated with  <dig> μci of 3h-thymidine   <dig> hours, in order to estimate proliferative activity. the amount of radioactivity was thereafter determined with a wallac  <dig> scintillation counter . naïve cd4+ cells were cultured under the same conditions as described above, but the cells were plated on 96-well plates at a concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well in  <dig> μl for  <dig> day cultures and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per well for  <dig> to  <dig> day cultures.

real-time reverse transcription- pcr
rna was isolated from naïve cd4+ cells, at the indicated time points, using a rnaeasy mini kit  following the manufacturer's instructions. gene expression was quantified using the sybr® green rt-pcr kit . pcr conditions were 50°c for  <dig> minutes and 95°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by  <dig> cycles with denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> seconds, annealing for  <dig> seconds at the various temperatures indicated in table  <dig> and extension at 72°c for  <dig> seconds. primer sequences are listed in table  <dig>  transcription levels were normalized against β-actin. all pcr reactions were run on a light cycler  and ct-values were calculated using the accompanying software.

cell cycle analysis
the cell cycle status of naïve cd4+ t cells was analyzed at the indicated time points by adding 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine   in a final conctration of  <dig> μm followed by a 2-hour incubation. the cells were subsequently fixed and permeabilized using the bd cytofix/cytoperm kit  following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. cell cycle status was determined by staining with anti-brdu-apc  and 7-amino-actinomyocin d   followed by analysis on a facscalibur  using cellquest software .

statistical analysis
data is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean . for comparison of difference between two groups with normal distributed data, unpaired students t-tests were used unless otherwise stated. for paired comparisons, one wild type and one age and sex matched knockout sample was analyzed simultaneously, under identical conditions, and the wild type and the knockout values were set as one observation each for the comparison. all p-values less than  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
effect of shb null allele on blood cell numbers
since shb has been demonstrated to interact with the tcr, but also with other receptors that are important for the development and function of the hematopoietic system it was of interest to determine whether the loss of shb expression would result in any alterations in the number of blood cells. hematocrit values and thrombocyte numbers appeared unchanged , whereas both lymphocyte  and monocyte  numbers were decreased in the shb knockout  .

aberrant signal transduction in shb knockout thymocytes
tcr signaling is of uttermost importance in thymocyte development as many of the survival and death signals are mediated through the receptor. peripheral lymphocyte numbers may therefore be adversely affected by a disruption of signaling during early thymocyte development. to explore this possibility further, wild type and knockout thymocytes were stimulated for  <dig> and  <dig> minutes, followed by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine antibody. this revealed alterations in important tcr signaling components. plc-γ phosphorylation was lowered after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes of stimulation in the shb knockout  whereas vav- <dig> and cbl display increased basal phosphorylation levels in knockout thymocytes. additionally, shb knockout thymocytes fail to mount any stimulation-induced increase of vav- <dig> and cbl phosphorylation . a similar pattern is observed when the corresponding lysastes were probed for tyrosine phosphorylations; two major phosphotyrosine proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> kda both display elevated basal phosphorylation levels but no stimulation effect . other studies performed on shb knockout endothelial cells and oocytes, have demonstrated elevated signaling in the absence of ligand-stimulation, suggesting this as being a feature in common in several signaling systems lacking shb  <cit> . zap <dig> phosphorylation was unaffected by the absence of shb, which is an expected finding since shb is predicted to operate downstream of zap <dig> in the tcr signaling pathway . moreover, extracellular signal regulated kinase  signaling, which has been implicated in positive selection  <cit> , appeared similar in the two groups of cells after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes of stimulation .

unaltered thymocyte development in the shb knockout mouse
since thymocytes exhibited a changed signaling pattern in response to tcr stimulation, thymi were isolated from mice  <dig> weeks of age, as thymocyte developmental activity is at a peak at this time  <cit> . thymocyte numbers were determined, but no distinguishable differences between knockout and wild type animals were observed . even though there was no detectable deviation in thymocyte numbers, relative changes in the proportions of different developmental subsets in the thymus could cause the reduced numbers of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. thymocytes were therefore stained for cd <dig> and cd <dig> in order to identify the different developmental stages  <cit> . however, shb knockout animals displayed no statistically significant changes in the relative numbers of double positive , single positive  cd4+, and sp cd8+ cells . thymocytes were also analyzed for cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression to enable a distinction between the different double negative  subsets  <cit> , but the shb knockout mice displayed no major differences in the dn1- <dig> populations  .

shb knockout th cells display altered signaling and proliferation
despite changes in the tcr response to stimulation observed in shb knockout thymocytes, knockout mice exhibited no major changes in central t cell development. this prompted us instead to evaluate peripheral t cell function. we first analyzed absolute numbers of splenocytes, yet no detectable difference between knockout and wild type animals was noted .

to further study the function of peripheral t cells, splenocytes were fractionated into cd4+ th cells and cd8+ tk cells and stimulated with cd <dig> and cd <dig> antibodies for  <dig> hours after which proliferation was assessed by estimating 3h thymidine incorporation. when compared to the wild type cells, the shb null cd4+ cells exhibited a modest proliferation increase in response to stimulation  . cd8+ shb knockout cells also displayed a slightly elevated proliferative response, although this effect did not reach statistical significance .

an increased proliferative rate is likely to be caused by changes in tcr signal transduction. t cell signaling was consequently examined by stimulating cd4+ th cells with cd <dig> antibody for  <dig> minutes. in immunodetection with phosphotyrosine antibody the shb knockout samples displayed an overall increased protein phosphorylation in the absence of stimulation , a pattern similar to what was observed in thymocytes. more specifically there was a difference between wild type and knockout in the phosphorylation of a  <dig> kda band under basal conditions as well as in stimulated cells . in addition, bands of molecular weights  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and 36/ <dig> kda exhibited a higher degree of phosphorylation in unstimulated shb knockout samples, but phosphorylation levels did not appear to increase with stimulation.

in order to address the effect on other signaling pathways downstream of shb, erk and p <dig> mapk activity was measured in the samples, as both are important for t cell survival and function. p <dig> mapk stimulation was poor in the knockout, partly as a consequence of increased basal signal, whereas there was a clear increase in the amount of phospho-p <dig> mapk in the wild type after stimulation . erk signaling on the other hand seemed normal .

th <dig> skewing in shb knockout t cells after stimulation
another important factor governing t cell proliferation is il- <dig>  a potent t cell mitogen  <cit> . to test whether altered cytokine production was also a part of the increased proliferation seen in shb knockout th cells, cytokine levels were monitored every  <dig> hours for up to  <dig> days. shb knockout t cells were found not to produce more il- <dig> than their wild type counterparts but rather less, although this difference failed to reach statistical significance . ifn-γ and il- <dig> production were also investigated, revealing increased levels of il- <dig> in the shb null samples at both  <dig> to  <dig> hours and at  <dig> to  <dig> hours  . ifn-γ levels were however similar in knockout and wild type .

il- <dig> is the hallmark cytokine of a th <dig> response and increased il- <dig> levels is indicative of a bias towards th <dig> driven immune response  <cit> . a th <dig> skewing in combination with hyperproliferation often coincides with an increase in the proportion of peripheral memory t cells  <cit> . memory and naïve t cells are distinguished by their differential expression of cd <dig> and cd62l  <cit> , shb knockout and wild type t cells were consequently stained for these markers in order to determine if knockout mice had higher levels of memory cells. however, no difference in the proportions of memory and naïve t cells was noted between knockout and wild type animals .

to further confirm that shb knockout cd4+ th cells have a tendency to develop a type  <dig> cytokine response, naïve cd4+cd62l+ t cells were isolated and stimulated. brdu incorporation and 7aad staining revealed that naïve knockout t cells appear to progress faster through the cell cycle when stimulated, as demonstrated by the modest but consistent increased percentage  of shb knockout cells in the later stages of the cell cycle at  <dig> and  <dig> hours of stimulation  . additionally, when cell numbers were determined at the given time points the relative increase in cell numbers were higher in shb knockout samples compared to the wild type .

since shb null naïve t cells also exhibited a lymphoproliferative phenotype we decided to assay cytokine production in cd4+cd62l+ t cells after tcr stimulation. levels of mrna revealed that il- <dig> was produced in similar amounts in knockout and wild type cells . il- <dig> gene expression was elevated at all recorded time points but only reached statistical significance at  <dig> and  <dig> hours . the differences in ct-values correspond to an increase of the shb ko il- <dig> mrna levels compared with wt to  <dig> ± 110% and  <dig> ± 20% at  <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively . ifn-γ levels were on the other hand similar in knockout and wild type samples .

the differentiation of a newly activated t cell into a th <dig> or a th <dig> cell is governed by the transcription factors gata <dig> and t-bet, respectively  <cit> . to further ascertain whether the shb knockout displays a th <dig> skewing the expression of these transcription factors was studied. the lack of shb resulted in an elevated expression of gata <dig> after  <dig> hours of stimulation   whereas t-bet levels appeared unaffected . the altered ct-value corresponds to a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold increase in gata <dig> mrna in the shb ko.

discussion
we have previously demonstrated the involvement of the adaptor protein shb in tcr signal transduction in jurkat cells. the current study expands these observations by examining t cell development and t cell function in a shb knockout mouse. our data establish that shb is dispensable for thymocyte development but that it exerts effects on peripheral cd4+ t cell signaling. consequently, unfractionated cd4+ and purified naïve t cells proliferate at a higher rate. an increased number of memory t cells is most probably not the cause of the shb knockout phenotype since no difference in the proportions of memory and naïve cd4+ t cells was noted and the hyperproliferative effect was also observed on purified naïve t cells. the aberrant tcr signaling is a more likely candidate for the observed elevation in proliferation.

shb knockout cd4+ t lymphocytes displayed accelerated levels of tyrosine phosphorylation under basal conditions. several signaling components, putatively vav- <dig>  lat and p <dig> mapk, were markedly more phosphorylated in the absence of tcr activation. stimulation-independent signaling has been implicated as an important factor in determining tcr signaling responsiveness  <cit> . for instance, microrna- <dig>  a negative regulator of several protein phophatases involved in tcr signaling, causes increased basal signaling and a lowered activation threshold when over-expressed  <cit> . the elevated basal phosphorylation of important tcr pathway targets in shb knockout cd4+ t cells could make them prone to respond quicker and more vigorously to a given stimulus than their wild type counter parts.

even though modifications in basal signaling might in part explain the high proliferative rate displayed by shb knockout mice, the phosphorylation pattern of lat is also important to take into consideration. shb and lat association, in response to tcr activation, has been demonstrated in jurkat cells  <cit> , and mice expressing the laty136f mutant show a phenotype reminiscent of the one present in the shb knockout, with th <dig> skewing and lymphoproliferation  <cit> . as already mentioned, a product probably corresponding to lat  exhibited a high level of basal phosphorylation in shb null t cells, without becoming additionally phosphorylated by stimulation. lat was originally identified as a key adaptor protein in the tcr signaling cascade, responsible for signals essential to t cell activation. recent studies have revealed that lat is not only a mediator of positive signals but also an important negative regulator of tcr signaling  <cit> . the defective stimulation-induced lat phosphorylation displayed by shb knockout t lymphocytes could result in a suboptimal assembly of the lat signalosome. consequently, negative feedback loops acting on the tcr machinery might be affected augmenting the proliferative response. on the other hand, laty136f mice have increased numbers of cd4+ memory cells  <cit> , and as above mentioned, no such increase could presently be detected in the shb knockout.

the changes in peripheral cd4+ signaling resemble those observed in the shb knockout thymus. in shb knockout thymocytes vav- <dig> displayed increased phosphorylation under basal conditions without any signs of further amplified phosphorylation after tcr stimulation. cbl is a ubiquitin ligase that exerts a role in down- regulating zap <dig> activity upon tcr stimulation  <cit> . since no difference in zap <dig> activity was noted upon tcr stimulation between wild type and shb knockout, it seems unlikely that the altered cbl phosphorylation pattern observed plays any major role in affecting the shb knockout t cell phenotype. instead the changes in cbl phosphorylation are probably a mere reflection of the overall effects of shb deficiency on the tcr signaling complex.

t cell proliferation is dependent on tcr signaling that in turn indirectly promotes cell division by activation of il- <dig> transcription  <cit> . il- <dig> production was, however, normal in knockout cells despite the appearance of an increased responsiveness to tcr stimulation excluding this as an explanation for the shb knockout hyper-responsiveness.

in addition, shb appears to affect more than proliferation, since the cytokine production was also different from that observed in wild type t cells. upon activation, cd4+ t cells have the choice of maturing into different classes of effector cells, each characterized by their own cytokine profile. th <dig> and th <dig> cells are the two major subsets, responsible for cellular and humoral immune responses, respectively  <cit> . signaling from the tcr and cytokine receptors are of great importance in the development of these effector cell responses. alterations in the activities of targets downstream of the tcr might therefore also affect cytokine production. vav- <dig> has for instance been demonstrated as an important factor in il- <dig> production and the generation of a th <dig> response. vav- <dig> knockout mice preferentially develop a th <dig> response and vav- <dig> in synergy with protein kinase c-Θ  has been implicated in the promotion of il- <dig> transcription  <cit> . as already noted shb knockout thymocytes as well as cd4+ t cells exhibited a slight alteration in their vav- <dig> activation. the increased basal activity of vav- <dig> in knockout cells may alter the intracellular signaling conditions in favor of a th <dig> response.

moreover, the development kinetics of th <dig> and th <dig> cells are quite different. the hallmark cytokine of th <dig> cells, ifn-γ is produced within hours of activation. transcripts from typical type  <dig> cytokines such as il- <dig> are on the other hand detected at the earliest on day  <dig> of stimulation in any significant amounts and a full-fledged th <dig> response can take weeks to develop  <cit> . the main reason for the slow development of th <dig> cells is thought to be the extensive chromatin remodeling that is required to fully open the il <dig> gene locus for transcription  <cit> . a critical part of the remodeling process is cellular proliferation and it has even been suggested that a certain number of cell divisions are required before il- <dig> transcription occurs  <cit> . naïve and unfractionated cd4+ t cells from shb null mice produce il- <dig> more promptly after stimulation. since absence of shb appeared to lead to an increased cell division rate and faster cell cycle progression it may well result in a more accessible il <dig> locus thus contributing to a slight th <dig> skewing in the immune system of shb knockout mice.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we observe that cd4+ naïve t lymphocytes lacking shb exhibit increased proliferation due to alterations in important tcr signaling pathways also resulting in a bias towards developing a th <dig> cytokine response. further studies of the effects of shb on the immune system may therefore prove useful in the elucidation of th <dig> driven pathologies such as allergies.
