BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is one of the most economically important swine pathogens worldwide. the first commercial pcv <dig> vaccine was used under special license in france and germany in  <dig>   <dig> years after postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome  was first identified and reported in western canada
 <cit> . in addition to pmws, pcv <dig> is also associated with a number of diseases and syndromes, collectively referred to as porcine circovirus-associated disease 
 <cit> .

currently,  <dig> commercial pcv <dig> vaccines are available worldwide and differ in their antigen
 <cit> . one vaccine  is based on the classical approach of an inactivated oil-adjuvanted vaccine. three subunit vaccines  are based on an open reading frame  <dig>  protein expressed in the baculovirus system. another vaccine  is based on a chimeric pcv1- <dig> virus containing the genomic backbone of the non-pathogenic pcv <dig>  with the orf <dig> capsid gene replaced by that of pcv2
 <cit> . in  <dig>  pfizer animal health temporarily removed the inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine product from the markets because a chimeric pcv1- <dig> virus was incidentally detected in the field due to incomplete inactivation of the vaccine
 <cit> . in august  <dig>  a reformulated version of the chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine under a new brand name  re-entered the market.

pcv <dig> viremia plays a central role in the development of pmws. high levels of pcv <dig> viremia are associated with the development of pcvad
 <cit> . reductions in the pcv <dig> viremia have coincided with the appearance of both pcv2-specific neutralizing antibodies  and interferon γ-secreting cells  in pcv2-infected animals
 <cit> . therefore, the induction of pcv2-specific na and ifn-γ-scs by commercial pcv <dig> vaccines is a critical parameter to evaluate the efficacy of pcv <dig> vaccines in the control of pcv <dig> infection. it has been reported that subunit and inactivated pcv <dig> vaccines elicit pcv2-specific na and ifn-γ-scs
 <cit> . although the former inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine induced pcv2-specific na
 <cit> , little is known regarding the protective immunity by which the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine reduces the pcv <dig> viremia. the objective of present study is to elucidate the mechanisms how humoral and cellular immune response induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine reduces pcv <dig> viremia under experimental conditions.

methods
animals and housing
a total of  <dig> colostrum-fed, cross-bred, conventional piglets were purchased at  <dig> days of age from a commercial farm. all piglets were negative for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  and mycoplasma hyopneumoniae according to routine serological testing. all piglets were negative for pcv1-2a and pcv <dig> viremia by real-time polymerase chain reaction , respectively
 <cit> . all piglets were also seronegative against pcv <dig> according to commercial elisa . all pigs were housed in an environmentally controlled building as previously described
 <cit> .

experimental design
a total of  <dig> piglets were randomly divided into  <dig> groups . the pigs in groups t <dig> and t <dig> were immunized with an inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine  administered as a  <dig>  ml dose at  <dig> days of age based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. at  <dig> days of age , the pigs in groups t <dig> and t <dig> were inoculated intranasally with  <dig> ml each of a pcv2b . the pigs in group t <dig> remained unvaccinated and unchallenged, and served as the negative control group. the pigs in each group were housed separately within the facility. blood samples and nasal swabs were collected at − <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpc. all pigs were euthanized for necropsy at  <dig> dpc and superficial inguinal lymph nodes were collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. all of the methods were previously approved by the seoul national university institutional animal care and use committee.

quantification of pcv <dig> dna in blood and nasal swab
dna was extracted from serum and nasal samples using the qiaamp dna mini kit. dna extracts were used to quantify pcv <dig> genomic dna copy numbers by real-time pcr as previously described by gagnon et al. 
 <cit> . dna extracts from serum samples were also used to detect pcv1-2a dna by real-time pcr as previously described by shen et al. 
 <cit> .

serology
the serum samples were tested using the commercial pcv <dig> elisa igg  and serum virus neutralization  test
 <cit> .

preparation of pcv <dig> antigen
the same pcv <dig> strain used for challenge in the present study, was propagated in pcv-free pk <dig> cells to a titer of  <dig> tcid50/ml and treated with two freeze-thaw cycles. the pcv <dig> antigen was prepared by concentrating the virus present in cell culture by ultracentrifugation at  <dig> x g at 4°c for  <dig> h. the virus pellet was resuspended with pbs. the concentrated pcv <dig> was inactivated by exposing to an  <dig> w germicidal uv lamp at a distance of  <dig> cm for  <dig> h. immunoperoxidase assay was performed to confirm the inactivation of virus as previously described by rodriguez-arrioja et al. 
 <cit> .

delayed type hypersensitivity
the delayed type hypersensitivity  test was performed on  <dig> piglets from  <dig> groups at  <dig> weeks of age . piglets were injected intradermally on the left inguinal area with  <dig> μg of pcv <dig> antigen from infected pk <dig> cells. phytohemaglutin  and saline  were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. the mean diameters of the induration at the test site were measured with a micrometer  <dig> h after injection.

direct immunofluorescence assay
cryosections  were prepared from skin biopsy specimens in dth test. sections were transferred to microscope slides treated with poly-l-lysine. the slides were fixed with acetone for  <dig> min and then air-dried. the slides were then covered with  <dig> μl of mouse anti-pig cd4a conjugated with r-phycoerythrin   and incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c in a moisture chamber. after three washing steps with pbs, the slides were mounted in buffered glycerin for observation by fluorescence microscopy.

enzyme-linked immunospot  assay
the numbers of pcv2-specific interferon-γ-secreting cells  were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  at − <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpc as previously described
 <cit> . briefly,  <dig> μl containing 2× <dig> pbmcs in rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  were seeded into plates pre-coated with anti-porcine ifn-γ monoclonal antibody  and incubated with  <dig> μl of pcv <dig> antigen , phytohemagglutinin  as a positive control, or pbs as a negative control for  <dig> h at 37°c in a 5% humidified co <dig> atmosphere. then, the wells were washed five times with pbs . thereafter, procedure was followed by manufacturer’s instructions using a commercial elispot assay kit . spots on the membranes were read by an automated elispot reader . the results were expressed as the number of responding cells per million pbmcs.

flow cytometry
pbmcs were incubated with r-pe- or fitc-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies  for  <dig> min at 4°c in the dark and washed twice with pbs containing  <dig> % sodium azide and  <dig> % bovine serum albumin. cells stained with conjugated antibodies were resuspended immediately in supplemented rpmi  <dig> medium. cells were analyzed using a facscalibur flow cytometer  as previously described by sosa et al. 
 <cit> .

histopathology and immunohistochemistry
for the morphometric analysis of histopathological lesion score and pcv <dig> antigen score in superficial inguinal lymph nodes were collected at necropsy. in each sample, three sections were randomly selected and examined “blindly” as previously described by kim et al. 
 <cit> . the scores of lesions in lymph nodes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the pcv <dig> antigen scores were obtained by counting the number of pcv <dig> positive cells per unit area .

statistical analysis
continuous data  were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance . if a one-way anova was significant , pairwise testing using tukey’s adjustment was performed. discrete data  were analyzed by chi-square and fisher’s exact test.

the pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship among viremia, serum virus neutralization titer, pcv2-specific ifn-γ-scs, and the spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to assess lymphoid lesion score and pcv <dig> antigen score. a value of p <  <dig>  was considered significant.

discussion
quantitation of the pcv <dig> viremia could predict pcv <dig> infection status. several studies have already shown that pcv <dig> dna levels in serum are higher in pig with pmws than in healthy, subclinically infected pigs
 <cit> . hence, the reduction of pcv <dig> viremia by the pcv <dig> vaccine plays a critical role in controlling pcv <dig> infection. in the present study, the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine is able to induce pcv2-specific na and ifn-γ-scs in vaccinated animals. this protective immunity induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine correlated with the reduction of pcv <dig> viremia in pigs challenged experimentally with solely pcv <dig> as induced by other commercial pcv <dig> vaccines did
 <cit> . however, the presence of anti-pcv <dig> igg antibodies did not correlate with the reduction of pcv <dig> viremia. the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine also reduced the pcv <dig> load in nasal shedding in vaccinated animals, thereby decreasing the risk of transmission to other pigs via a nasal route and decreasing the amount of pcv <dig> circulating among the pigs.

ifn-γ, which is produced by pcv2-specific ifn-γ-scs, is a key immunoregulatory cytokine that controls the differentiation of naïve cd4+ into cd4+ cells and mediates cellular immunity against viral infections
 <cit> . our results are further supported by the observation that elevated numbers of cd4+ cells are seen in vaccinated animals only. lymphocyte subset analysis indicated that the numbers of cd3+ and cd4+ cells increased in vaccinated animals but the numbers of cd4+ cells decreased transiently in non-vaccinated animals. the selective loss of cd3+ and cd4+ cells that is observed in pigs with pmws
 <cit>  may impair the immune system in the pigs and result in co-infections with other viral and bacterial pathogens; co-infections are frequently observed in pigs with pmws under field conditions
 <cit> . because cd4+ cells promote a dth response
 <cit> , the dth response observed in only vaccinated animals also supports a cd4+ cell-associated protective cellular immune response that is induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine. pcv2-specific memory t lymphocytes induced by this chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine mount dth reactions in response to intradermal injection of the pcv <dig> antigen. hence, the induction of pcv2-specific na and ifn-γ-scs by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine is the important protective immune response that leads to reduce the pcv <dig> viremia and control the pcv <dig> infection.

well-controlled experimental studies are necessary to elucidate the protective humoral and cellular immune response induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine to reduce pcv <dig> viremia because the results can be affected by factors such as environment, feed, pig source, immune status and inoculums. under field conditions, pcv <dig> continues to circulate among pigs within the herd and the possibility of exposure and re-exposure to the virus by horizontal transmission occurs once one animal becomes infected. to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of protective humoral and cellular immunity induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine and its effect on reduction of pcv <dig> viremia by vaccination.

CONCLUSIONS
the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine is able to induce pcv2-specific na and ifn-γ-scs in vaccinated animals. this protective immunity induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine correlated with the reduction of pcv <dig> viremia in pigs challenged experimentally with solely pcv <dig>
