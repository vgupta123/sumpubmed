BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  infections remain a major healthcare burden considering the emergence of more virulent community-acquired or -associated mrsa  in addition to the longer existent hospital-acquired  mrsa strains.

while an abundance of mrsa typing data from the united states, western europe and australia are available, comparable data for the middle east are generally scarce. with regard to ha-mrsa strains, the pandemic strain st239-iii appears to be widespread in the region  <cit> . that strain was reportedly common in saudi arabia during the 1990s  <cit> . another pandemic strain, cc22-iv  has been detected in kuwait  <cit>  and abu dhabi  <cit> . studies in various hospitals and several countries indicated an increased number of ca-mrsa infections confirmed by strain typing data. pvl-positive strains, which are usually regarded as community-associated, have been found in kuwait  <cit> , abu dhabi  <cit> , lebanon  <cit> , egypt  <cit> , tunisia  <cit> , algeria  <cit>  as well as in people travelling from and to various middle eastern countries  <cit> .

in riyadh, the capital of the kingdom of saudi arabia, an increasing number of mrsa cases has been detected since the application of an infection control policy requiring a systematic mrsa screening of patients prior to admission in hospitals in  <dig>  <cit> . the mrsa prevalence in patients seen in king fahad medical city in riyadh was  <dig> % for the year  <dig> , and thus it is within a similar order of magnitude to other hospitals in saudi arabia  <cit> . according to an earlier one year study  performed in a hospital in the western region of saudi arabia  <cit> , the mrsa prevalence was  <dig> % of which  <dig> % showed resistance to erythromycin, gentamicin and oxytetracycline. the prevalence of ca-mrsa in a hospital in the eastern region increased by six-fold during a 5-year period, between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

to obtain the first mrsa typing data concerning saudi arabian patients, one hundred and seven mrsa isolates from king fahad medical city  in riyadh were characterised using dna microarrays.

RESULTS
altogether,  <dig> patient isolates were analysed for this study. detailed data on patients' demographics and the origin of samples are provided as additional file  <dig> 

for ten isolates, clinical and patient data could not be retrieved; for two additional isolates, patient data were not available. out of the ninety isolates for which demographic data were available,  <dig>  originated from male patients and  <dig>  from females. the mean age of patients was  <dig>  the median 22 years. patients carrying st239-iii were older than average .

additionally, five isolates from four environmental samples collected by the infection control & environmental health department  were included. this included two pvl-negative cc22-iv, two pvl-positive cc22-iv and one pvl-positive cc30-iv.

prevalence of resistance- and virulence-associated genes
table  <dig> shows which percentages of clinically important genes, i.e., resistance or virulence associated markers, sccmec elements and agr groups were found among the studied isolates.

most significantly, the prevalence of the genes encoding the panton-valentine leukocidin  was high .

clonal complexes and strains
isolates were assigned to ccs and strains based on hybridisation profiles as defined previously  <cit> . five major mrsa clones from four clonal complexes  predominated. these highly prevalent strains included cc8/st239-iii, , pvl-positive cc22-iv and pvl-negative cc22-iv , pvl-positive st30-iv  and pvl-positive cc80-iv . sporadic mrsa strains included pvl-negative cc5-iv, cc5-iv/sccfus, cc6-iv  and pvl-positive cc88-iv, pvl-positive cc5-iv, pvl-negative cc80-iv, cc97-v as well as cc1-iv/sccfus , pvl-positive cc1/st772-v , pvl-negative cc5-v, cc45-iv  and a cc9/st834-mrsa strain with an unidentified sccmec element.

some major international mrsa clones, such as cc5-ii , pvl-positive st8-iv , cc30-ii , or cc45-ii  were not detected among the tested sample population.

strain descriptions
short strain profiles with regard to the carriage of resistance- or virulence-associated genes and to other genes of relevance for the determination of ccs are shown in table  <dig>  full hybridisation profiles are provided in the additional file  <dig> 

clonal complex 1
two isolates were identified that belong to cc <dig>  one pvl-negative isolate carried sccmec iv as well as ccra- <dig>  ccrb- <dig> and the fusidic acid resistance marker q6gd <dig> . thus it can be regarded as identical to the west australian  strain wa mrsa- <dig> and some of the isolates originally described as wa mrsa- <dig>  <cit> .

the other isolate was identified as pvl-positive st772-v, also known as bengal bay clone or wa mrsa- <dig>  this is a distinct clone which differs from other cc <dig> strains in several features such as in the agr allele , capsule type , carriage of the enterotoxin-like gene orf cm <dig>  and the absence of the enterotoxin h gene seh.

clonal complex 5
both, pvl-negative as well as pvl-positive cc5-iv  as well as one pvl-negative cc5-v isolate were found.

three isolates belonged to a strain previously known only from malta  <cit> . it is characterised by the presence of the fusidic acid resistance marker q6gd <dig>  and additional recombinase genes beside a sccmec iv element  <cit> . one out of these isolates harboured, beside egc, also tst <dig>  sec and sel .

clonal complex 6
three isolates belonged to cc6-iv, which is identical to the australian strains wa mrsa- <dig> and − <dig>  they lacked pvl, but carried sea.

clonal complex 8/sequence type 239
all  <dig> cc <dig> isolates belonged to st239-iii, which is a divergent strain that emerged from an incorporation of a large fragment of cc <dig> dna  <cit> . all these isolates harboured the beta-lactamase-operon and tet  as well as, variably, further resistance genes as shown in table  <dig>  all isolates carried enterotoxin genes sek and seq.

patients carrying this strain were older than average .

clonal complex 9/sequence type 834
st <dig> is a distinct sequence type within cc <dig> that differs in several markers including the alleles of the regulatory locus agr  and of some adhesion factors , in capsule type  and spa type and in the presence of sasg .

one isolate was identified as cc9/st <dig> being essentially identical to the australian strain st834-iv, or wa mrsa- <dig>  in all markers but the sccmec element. it yielded signals for meca, a truncated signal transducer protein mecr <dig>  ugpq , ccrb- <dig> and q6gd <dig>  as well as beta-lactamase and msr . this strain carried tst <dig>  sec and sel, but lacked pvl genes.

clonal complex 22
cc <dig> was common; and pvl-positive as well as pvl-negative cc22-iv were identified.

eighteen patient samples and two environmental samples were pvl-positive cc22-iv. all isolates harboured the beta-lactamase-operon and aaca-aphd. other common resistance genes included aadd , erm and dfra . virulence markers included egc and lukf/s-pvl, but no other toxin genes were identified.

eight patient samples and two environmental samples were pvl-negative cc22-iv, i.e. identical or similar to the uk-emrsa-15/barnim epidemic strain. one of the environmental strains originated from the same sample as one of the pvl-positive cc22-iv. since it was identical to it with regard to all markers but pvl genes, being positive for erm, dfra and aaca-aphd, it is likely that it was in fact a deletion variant of that strain. the tst <dig> gene was detected in six isolates, but enterotoxin genes sec and sel were not found.

clonal complex 30
thirteen samples, including one environmental, belonged to pvl-positive cc30-iv . these isolates could be clustered into three variants based on the carriage of resistance genes. one variant  harboured the beta-lactamase gene, but lacked other resistance markers. a second variant  lacked blaz, but carried erm. the third variant  was positive for beta-lactamase, msr and mph as well as apha <dig> and sat. virulence-associated genes included lukf/s-pvl and egc; other enterotoxin genes were not found.

clonal complex 45
one single isolate of cc45-iv was found. it differed from the cc45-iv or berlin epidemic strain, which is commonly detected in western europe, in harbouring sasg as well as different alleles of the agr locus  and of adhesion factors fnba, fnbb, sdrd and vwb. thus it was related or identical to the wa mrsa- <dig> strain and to isolates previously identified in hong kong  <cit> . the isolate carried beta-lactamase as well as enterotoxin genes sej and ser.

clonal complex 80
two different cc80-iv strains were observed, one being pvl-positive and the other one pvl-negative. two isolates were pvl-negative cc80-iv; one of them harboured enterotoxin genes seb, sek and seq.

nineteen isolates from eighteen patients belonged to the pvl-positive cc80-iv strain . six different variants of that strain could be differentiated based on various combinations of resistance genes blaz, erm, apha3 + sat, far <dig> and tet. one patient carried two isolates which differed in carriage of blaz and far <dig>  all pvl-positive cc80-iv isolates also harboured edinb and etd, but no enterotoxin genes were found.

clonal complex 88
three isolates belonged to a pvl-positive cc88-iv strain. two out of three were positive for the distinct variant of the enterotoxin a gene, sea-n <dig> or sep, which is mainly known from the cc <dig> genome sequence of strain n <dig> .

clonal complex 97
two isolates were identified as cc97-v. both harboured the beta-lactamase operon and q6gd <dig>  one was positive for aaca-aphd and tet. both isolates lacked pvl as well as other exotoxin genes.

discussion
a striking result of the study was a high diversity of different mrsa strains and clonal complexes as well as a high prevalence of pvl. the most common strains identified during this study were st239-iii, pvl-positive and -negative cc22-iv, pvl-positive cc30-iv and pvl-positive cc80-iv.

st239-iii is a pandemic clone which is mainly hospital-associated. this might be the reason why carriers of that strain were older than the average. st239-iii was previously identified in various middle eastern countries including abu dhabi  <cit> , iran  <cit> , iraq  <cit> , saudi arabia  <cit>  and turkey  <cit> . pvl-positive cc22-iv has been previously found in great britain and ireland, germany and abu dhabi  <cit> . middle eastern isolates, i.e., those from abu dhabi  <cit>  and from the present study, generally differed from european ones in carrying additional resistance markers . pvl-negative cc22-iv represents a pandemic strain known as uk-emrsa- <dig>  or barnim epidemic strain. this strain is increasingly common in western europe and has also been found in malta  <cit> , kuwait  <cit>  and abu dhabi  <cit> . however, with an incidence of only  <dig> % among our isolates it was distinctly less common than in western europe, where 50-95% of mrsa isolates might belong to that strain  <cit> . its prevalence was also markedly low compared to a study from abu dhabi  <cit> , where this strain accounted for  <dig> % of mrsa isolates. this observation might be attributed to different population structures, to different patient collectives served by the respective hospitals and to a significant presence of european expatriates in the united arab emirates. isolates of that strain from both, riyadh and abu dhabi, often harboured tst <dig>  which is normally absent from european isolates. interestingly, the tst <dig> gene in that strain was not accompanied by sec and sel genes. this might indicate another genetic background than the previously characterised tst1-carrying pathogenicity island sapi <dig>  <cit> . pvl-positive cc22-iv have been described from bavaria, germany  <cit>  as well as from australia  <cit> , england  <cit>  and ireland  <cit> . observations of that strain from abu dhabi  <cit>  and in german patients with family ties to turkey  <cit>  as well as the present study might suggest that this strain is common and widespread in the middle east. pvl-positive cc30-iv is a strain mainly known from the pacific islands, samoa and new zealand, but also from abu dhabi  <cit>  and kuwait  <cit> . an importation of that strain into gulf countries appears to be likely due to the high numbers of immigrant labourers from pacific countries such as the philippines, as similarly noted in denmark  <cit> . pvl-positive cc80-iv has been dubbed the european ca-mrsa strain as it is widespread although sporadically detected across several european countries. however, it appears to be more predominant in the middle east and maghreb  countries being detected not only in saudi arabia but also in abu dhabi  <cit> , kuwait  <cit> , lebanon  <cit> , tunisia  <cit>  and algeria  <cit> .

other strains were rare being identified only in sporadic cases, accounting for less than 3% each. some of the minor strains have been previously observed in other regions so that an importation might be likely. for others no, or only few, data on distribution or prevalence are available. therefore it is not clear if they emerged locally or if they have been imported. for instance, cc1/st772-v is known to mainly occur in india and bangladesh, and cases in europe are usually linked to these countries  <cit> . there might also be an epidemiological link to india for the isolate from this study, as there are high numbers of indian workers, including healthcare workers, in riyadh. cc5-iv is known to occur essentially worldwide. cc5-iv/sccfus has been described only from malta  <cit> , so it would be interesting to check whether this strain has a wider distribution in the mediterranean countries and the middle east. cc6-iv has previously been observed not only in australia, but also in abu dhabi  <cit> . interestingly, cc6-mssa has been found to be a common clone in middle eastern camels  <cit>  so that a local emergence of cc6-iv after inter-species transfer and acquisition of a sccmec element appears to be possible. pvl-negative cc80-iv appear to be extremely scarce, and the few detected isolates might be deletion variants of the so-called european ca-mrsa clone. one of the two isolates identified in this study carried enterotoxin genes, which is also a rare feature among cc <dig>  pvl-positive cc88-iv are known from abu dhabi and, sporadically, from europe. cc97-v has been previously identified in egypt, which warrants further study on its presence in the middle east. since cc <dig> mssa are common among domestic animals, here again a possible transmission from livestock should be investigated.

the mrsa strains found in saudi arabian patients showed a significantly high carriage of pvl genes . comparable high figures have been reported from algeria  <cit>  as well as from abu dhabi . these are much higher proportions than observed in western european countries  <cit> . reasons for this difference are largely unknown. a possible explanation was a generally higher carriage of pvl in s. aureus from the middle east, possibly related to climatic or host factors. if that was the case, the frequency of pvl-positive-methicillin susceptible s. aureus  should also be high. however, data on mssa from this region are currently not yet available. in order to understand the local epidemiology of pvl, further studies need to focus on mssa as well as on mrsa in middle eastern countries.

it also might be speculated that pvl-mrsa just replaced pvl-mssa in the middle east, possibly favoured by a liberal use of antimicrobial drugs during the last decades. interestingly, previously published mrsa genotyping data from saudi arabia showed a much lower pvl prevalence of only 8%  in sccmec iv strains isolated from skin tissue infections from patients seen in outpatient clinics in riyadh in  <dig>  <cit> . this finding may possibly relate to the small number of isolates processed or to a different patient collective. it might also indicate a massive expansion of pvl-positive mrsa clones during very recent years. this is also in accordance to an otherwise observed increase in ca-mrsa infections  <cit> . these observations emphasise the need for a more systematic surveillance of this potential public-health hazard.

another interesting finding was that resistance markers that are traditionally associated with ha-mrsa  were common among ca-mrsa strains. for instance, all pvl-positive cc22-iv in this study carried aaca-aphd. thus, the detection of, e.g., gentamicin resistance in a clinical isolate must not be used to rule out a community origin or a possible presence of pvl in that actual isolate; and the decision to perform a molecular assay for pvl should be guided by the clinical symptoms of the patient rather than by the susceptibility profile of the isolate.

CONCLUSIONS
a number of very diverse mrsa strains were found in riyadh, saudi arabia in addition to a long established healthcare-associated mrsa strain . the prevalence of panton-valentine leukocidin genes was surprisingly high , with pvl-positive clones also being present in a healthcare setting. a significant rate of resistance markers was detected in strains usually considered as community-associated. this is a rather different situation than in european countries. screening and eradication programs thus need to focus not only on patients, but also on contact persons such as family members and healthcare personnel, too. further studies are still needed to understand the epidemiology of mrsa in saudi arabia, possible changes in population structures during the last decades and possible sources for importation of epidemic strains from other regions.
