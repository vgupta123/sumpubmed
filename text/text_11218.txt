BACKGROUND
the influenza a virus has its natural reservoir in wild waterfowl, who transmit it sporadically to other avian species along migratory flyways
 <cit> . the main antigenic influenza proteins - the surface proteins haemagglutinin  and neuraminidase  - are each encoded by a separate rna segment and are classified into subtypes which do not cross-react serologically. reassortment – the exchange of genetic segments between co-infecting parental viruses during replication – leads to novel combinations of ha and na subtypes. there are currently  <dig> known ha subtypes  and  <dig> known subtypes of na  circulating in birds
 <cit> . whilst all of subtypes h1-h <dig> and n1-n <dig> can be found amongst wild waterfowl
 <cit> , viruses with certain ha/na combinations occur frequently in nature whereas others are rarely observed
 <cit> . this, combined with the failure of laboratory studies to produce viable reassortant viruses of particular subtype combinations, has led to the suggestion that there is a requirement for a functional match between the influenza ha and na
 <cit> .

the ha and na proteins play complementary roles in the life cycle of the influenza virus. both ha and na bind to host cell receptors containing sialic acid residues: ha to initiate viral entry into the host cell, and na to permit the release of viral progeny from infected cells. experimental studies have suggested that a fine balance between ha and na activity must be achieved for productive viral infection
 <cit> . such a balance may, in fact, be more important for viral fitness than high levels of activity per se. for example,
 <cit>  showed that when artificially generated reassortant viruses of the n <dig> na subtype were cultured, several  only gave low yields. however, when the low-yield h3n <dig> culture was passaged, a number of changes occurred in the ha which reduced its receptor binding affinity, apparently to match that of the na in the reassortant rather than to return to the high levels of ha activity found in the h3n <dig> parent virus.

both the ha and na proteins are thought to determine sensitivity of naturally-occurring influenza viruses to neuraminidase-inhibiting drugs 
 <cit> . in vitro studies have investigated genetic interactions between ha and na in terms of nai resistance. evidence suggests that mutations in the ha which decrease receptor binding activity may compensate for a decrease in na activity resulting from treatment with nais, thus restoring the balance between ha and na function
 <cit> . in addition, ha and na mutations which individually confer low-level resistance to nais have been found to combine synergistically to confer resistance at a higher level
 <cit> . interdependence between the length of the na stalk section and the number of ha glycosylation sites has been identified in laboratory strains
 <cit>  and may also have direct consequences for the transmission of influenza viruses to other host species. for example, influenza a viruses which have become established in terrestrial poultry may possess additional ha glycosylation sites, accompanied by deletions in the stalk section of their na
 <cit> .

reassortment has been implicated in the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses, including those of avian origin which were responsible for significant human mortality in the twentieth century
 <cit>  and the  <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic strain
 <cit> . naturally-occurring reassortment events could affect the functional balance between the ha and na proteins
 <cit>  and this could in turn affect their evolution. whilst previous studies have investigated evolutionary rates of influenza , few have focused on how rates of evolution are affected by genetic interactions between segments
 <cit> .

evolution of protein coding sequences can be quantified in terms of rates of synonymous  and non-synonymous substitution  and their ratio, dn/ds, following the counting-based methods of
 <cit>  and
 <cit> . departures from selective neutrality can be detected by a dn/ds ratio which differs from  <dig>  positive selection is inferred when dn/ds >  <dig>  when dn/ds <  <dig>  it is inferred that purifying selection is acting. however, gene-wide estimates of dn/ds which show overall purifying selection may mask a small number of sites experiencing positive selection. for example, while the overall rate of non-synonymous substitution across the influenza ha has been found to be lower than the synonymous substitution rate in birds and humans , evidence has been provided for positive selection at certain amino acid sites, particularly those of antigenic significance .

avian influenza viruses of the h <dig> ha subtype present an epidemiological and economic threat on a global scale. along with h <dig>  h <dig> is the only subtype associated with the highly pathogenic form of avian influenza and has been known to cause outbreaks in domestic poultry , human infection
 <cit>  and even human mortality
 <cit> . the danger posed by h <dig> viruses is exemplified by recent human infections with h7n <dig> avian influenza, which had claimed at least  <dig> lives in china as of  <dig> may,  <dig>  and has been associated with an estimated 36% fatality rate amongst cases admitted to hospital
 <cit> . in particular, reassortment events between h <dig>  n <dig> and h9n <dig> viruses have been suggested to have been important in the emergence of the outbreak-causing h7n <dig> lineage
 <cit> .

in this study, we adopted a bayesian stochastic mutational mapping approach
 <cit>  to investigate how the association with different na subtypes influences the evolution of the ha-encoding segment of avian influenza. specifically, dn/ds ratios of avian influenza h <dig> ha <dig> were evaluated for clades associated with different na subtype backgrounds. we extended the mutational mapping approach of nielsen
 <cit>  by rescaling the inferred numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous changes to calculate dn/ds. ancestral trait mapping was used to construct a clade-model that inferred background na subtypes for branches across the tree, and dn/ds was averaged across all parts of the tree corresponding to a particular subtype. the ancestral trait mapping accounts for a lack of monophyly across the tree with respect to na subtype background, which arises through repeated exposure of h <dig> ha to different na backgrounds via reassortment. we find substantial differences between gene-wide dn/ds for avian influenza h <dig> ha on different na subtype backgrounds, consistent with the hypothesis that the selective pressure experienced by ha can be affected by its genetic context.

RESULTS
distribution of avian influenza h <dig> ha sequences
we downloaded all available unique avian influenza ha coding sequences from the ncbi influenza virus resource and labelled them according to the na subtype of the virus . the dataset we analysed contained over  <dig> sequences from viruses of each of na background subtypes n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  the distribution of these sequences with respect to other virus and host properties, specifically the taxonomic order of the avian host and the viral pathogenicity, was also considered . examination of the sequence names revealed that 71% of the sequences were known to have been isolated from terrestrial poultry and approximately 16% were from aquatic fowl. most of the sequences from birds of the order anseriformes were likely to have been isolated from farmed birds   although a small number were known to be from wild aquatic birds. on all na subtype backgrounds, the majority of sequences were from galliformes, although isolates from anseriformes were present for all subtypes . literature searching for laboratory-confirmed pathogenic status of avian influenza viruses revealed that approximately two-thirds of the sequences were from highly pathogenic  viruses, although numbers of hp and low pathogenic  isolates were not distributed evenly across the subtypes. for example, h7n <dig> viruses have only been reported in the low pathogenic form despite several years of circulation in live bird markets
 <cit> , whilst approximately half of the h7n <dig> isolates in the dataset were from hp viruses.

numbers of h <dig> sequences associated with different na subtypes, avian hosts, viral pathogenicities and years and locations of sampling are given in brackets. note that it was not possible to determine such information for all sequences. for different avian host taxonomic orders, we use the abbreviations ans. = anseriformes, and gal. = galliformes.

for each background na subtype, the h <dig> ha sequences covered a time-span of at least  <dig> years. there were roughly equal numbers of sequences from eurasia and america , and sequences from europe, asia and north america were present for all four subtypes considered. the geographic spread of h <dig> avian influenza viruses of different background na subtypes appeared to differ between continents. for example, 85% of the h7n <dig> sequences and 74% of the h7n <dig> sequences were from europe, whilst 88% of the h7n <dig> isolates were from north america. h7n <dig> appeared to be the most ubiquitously sampled subtype, in terms of location, host order and pathogenicity. overall, geographic and temporal diversity appeared to be captured in all subtypes.

phylogenetic analysis of avian influenza h <dig> ha
phylogenetic trees constructed for the avian influenza h <dig> ha <dig> coding region revealed a split into major geographical lineages which was consistent between maximum likelihood  and bayesian phylogenetic methods . the major lineages corresponded to viruses sampled in  europe, asia, africa and australasia  and  north and south america . the existence of eurasian and american lineages has previously been identified in avian influenza h <dig> ha
 <cit> , as well as in other ha subtypes and different gene segments
 <cit> . we observed a split in the american clade into north american and south american sequences , which has also previously been suggested
 <cit> .

within the eurasian clade, the australian isolates formed a clade with 100% bootstrap support. the maintenance of a distinct australasian lineage of h <dig> avian influenza within the eurasian clade, with continued reassortment of different na subtypes onto the h <dig> ha, has recently been reported
 <cit> . the phylogenetic position of early european fowl plague viruses  as a sister lineage to the australian clade has been observed in other studies
 <cit>  and was observed in our ml and mrbayes phylogenies, although both methods appeared to have difficulty in placing this clade . following other evolutionary studies
 <cit> , we excluded the fpv sequences from our mutational mapping analysis of evolutionary rates, since they have been highly cultured and may show artificially high rates of molecular change.

on a smaller geographic scale, h <dig> ha sequences from within avian influenza outbreaks, such as the italian h7n <dig> outbreak of 1999– <dig>  clustered together. the observation that h <dig> ha sequences from viruses with different na subtype backgrounds were distributed across the tree, rather than forming distinct clades, is indicative of repeated reassortment between h <dig> ha and na of different subtypes. avian h <dig> ha sequences did not cluster into distinct lineages corresponding to hp or lp viruses, or viruses from avian hosts of orders anseriformes or galliformes.

comparison of selection in h <dig> avian influenza ha on different na subtype backgrounds
we used stochastic mutational mapping
 <cit>   to infer mutational histories for the  <dig> avian influenza h <dig> ha <dig> mrbayes phylogeny samples. estimates of dn and ds averaged across sites in the influenza ha <dig> were calculated for parts of the phylogenies corresponding to na background subtypes n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> as described in methods. this allowed the selective pressure on h <dig> influenza ha <dig> to be compared across different na subtype backgrounds. uncertainty in the mutational mapping process was accounted for by simulating, and averaging over,  <dig> mutational histories for each of the  <dig> posterior phylogeny samples. the rate of synonymous substitution  was substantially higher than the rate of non-synonymous substitution  for avian influenza h <dig> ha <dig> on all background na subtypes , with no overlap between the 90% highest posterior density  intervals for dn and ds. lower rates of non-synonymous substitution than synonymous substitution resulted in gene-wide dn/ds estimates which were substantially less than one for all na subtype backgrounds, indicating an overall pattern of purifying selection across the ha <dig>  this is in line with previous studies
 <cit> , which have suggested that the influenza ha is conserved overall.

for all  <dig> mrbayes phylogeny samples, the average dn estimate across all ha <dig> sites for a given na background was plotted against the ds value for that tree sample . this indicated that a phylogeny sample with a higher rate of synonymous substitution would also have a higher rate of non-synonymous substitution, although the rate of synonymous substitution was not an exact predictor of the corresponding non-synonymous substitution rate. it may be observed that, whilst the same ds value would lead to a similar expected dn for background na subtypes n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  there was little overlap between the dn values on the n <dig> background and on backgrounds n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  with the dn values for n <dig> appearing to be higher than for the other na background subtypes.

for each background na subtype, the ha1-wide dn value for each tree sample was divided by the ds value for that tree sample, to obtain  <dig> ha1-wide posterior estimates of the dn/ds ratio on each of na backgrounds n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> . plots of the hpd intervals for dn, ds and dn/ds allowed posterior distributions of evolutionary rates to be visualised for h <dig> ha lineages associated with different na subtypes . we observed similar means and 90% hpd intervals for ds across all na subtype backgrounds. however, for both dn and dn/ds, the mean of the h7n <dig> distribution lay above the upper 90% hpd limit of the distributions for the other na background subtypes . the means for dn and dn/ds for background na subtypes n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> lay below the lower limit of the 90% hpd interval for h7n <dig>  although a small amount of overlap was observed between the lower 90% hpd limit of the distribution for h7n <dig> and the upper 90% hpd limit for the other subtypes.

for each background na subtype, the average dn/ds across the ha <dig> coding region was obtained for each mcmc sample by first averaging over mutational mapping replicates on that tree, then calculating average values for dn and ds across all ha <dig> sites. within tree samples, the site-averaged dn was divided by the site-averaged ds for that na subtype, to obtain  <dig> posterior estimates of the dn/ds ratio for each na subtype background.

in the absence of differences in synonymous substitution rates between the subtypes, the elevated rate of non-synonymous substitution across the avian influenza ha <dig> in h7n <dig> lineages led to the apparent increase in dn/ds for h7n <dig> compared to h7n <dig>  h7n <dig> and h7n <dig>  in order to compare posterior distributions of evolutionary rates for h <dig> ha <dig> on different na subtype backgrounds, randomised pairing of sampled rate estimates on different na backgrounds was performed . for arbitrary background na subtypes a and b, the proportion  of the randomly paired samples for which the rate for subtype a was greater than for subtype b , or less than for subtype b , was reported . for example, p =  <dig> / <dig>  would mean that the value for subtype a was greater than for subtype b in 5% of pairings, and less than for subtype b in 95% of pairings. a split at least as extreme as  <dig> / <dig>  in either direction was interpreted as a substantial difference in the location of the distributions for the two subtypes.

the proportion of randomised pairings of posterior rate samples for which the value for the first subtype in the comparison, minus the value for the second subtype in the comparison, was greater than  <dig>  and less than  <dig>  is reported. similar distributions would be indicated by the difference being greater than  <dig>  in approximately 50% of pairings. differences in the location of the distributions would be indicated by a more extreme split in one direction.

for all na subtype comparisons, the distributions of paired differences for ds were roughly centred on zero , indicating no substantial differences between the distributions, as suggested by the hpd interval plot. however, the pairwise difference comparisons indicated an elevated rate of non-synonymous change in h7n <dig>  leading to a substantially higher dn/ds for h7n <dig> than for the other subtypes .

our results for the ordering of dn/ds values across h <dig> ha <dig> on different na subtype backgrounds are consistent with the point estimates obtained by a previous study
 <cit>  which was based upon the single likelihood ancestor counting  method
 <cit> . the results from
 <cit>  could not be statistically compared between subtypes and did not account for uncertainty in the phylogenetic or mutational history. furthermore, estimating dn/ds separately for h <dig> ha datasets corresponding to different background na subtypes, as was carried out in
 <cit> , implicitly assumes that the tree of all h <dig> ha sequences should split into distinct clades according to background na subtype. our phylogenetic analysis, along with previous studies , has shown that h <dig> ha sequences are not monophyletic with respect to viral na subtype. it is therefore possible that error might be introduced into dn/ds estimates from datasets corresponding to individual na subtype backgrounds, by incorrectly assuming that ancestral lineages were associated with a particular na subtype.

comparison of avian influenza h <dig> ha <dig> dn/ds by virus pathogenicity and avian host
the distribution of the avian influenza h <dig> ha sequences we analysed was not uniform across na subtypes in terms of virus pathogenicity or avian host . we therefore carried out further mutational mapping analyses to assess whether differences in avian host or viral pathogenicity might have confounded the comparisons of evolutionary rates of h <dig> ha on different na subtype backgrounds. evolutionary rates dn, ds and their ratio, dn/ds, were compared for lineages corresponding to highly pathogenic  and low pathogenic  avian influenza viruses, and for viruses isolated from anseriformes , galliformes  and other avian hosts . as may be observed from the means and 90% hpd intervals for dn/ds  and the randomised pairing analysis for comparing distributions , dn, ds and dn/ds did not differ substantially between hp and lp lineages, indicating that viral pathogenicity did not have a discernible effect on the average selective pressure experienced across h <dig> avian influenza ha <dig>  likewise, no substantial difference was observed in the distributions of evolutionary rates between lineages corresponding to viruses sampled from avian host orders anseriformes or galliformes . we also investigated the relationship between the proportion of sequences from terrestrial poultry  and dn/ds for each background na subtype and did not find a significant correlation between them , although the power to detect a significant effect would be low, due to the existence of just four data points.

stochastic mutational mapping was used to calculate dn/ds along lineages corresponding to viruses of high pathogenicity  and low pathogenicity  for  <dig> mcmc tree samples, in an analogous manner to that described for comparisons by background na subtype.

evolutionary rate distributions were compared for highly pathogenic  and low pathogenic  lineages in an analogous manner to that described for different background na subtypes.

stochastic mutational mapping was used to calculate dn/ds along lineages corresponding to viruses from different avian host orders  for  <dig> mcmc tree samples, in an analogous manner to that described for comparisons by background na subtype.

evolutionary rate distributions corresponding to lineages from avian hosts of orders anseriformes  and galliformes  were compared in an analogous manner to that described for different background na subtypes.

site-by-site analysis of h <dig> ha <dig> dn/ds on different na subtype backgrounds
estimates of dn and ds at individual h <dig> ha <dig> codon sites were calculated separately for each na background subtype in order to investigate the process driving differences in selective pressure between h <dig> ha <dig> on an n <dig> na background, compared to an n <dig>  n <dig> or n <dig> background, and to identify sites under putative positive selection. of the  <dig> codon sites studied, the vast majority  had a mean dn/ds ratio of less than  <dig>  a small number of sites were identified as being under putative positive selection, i.e. with mean dn/ds >  <dig> across mutational mapping replicates and phylogeny samples, and such sites were distributed across the ha <dig> sub-segment . the domain in which each site with mean dn/ds >  <dig> was observed was recorded. sites under putative positive selection were observed in all domains: the signal peptide region, which directs the ha protein to the virion surface; the fusion domain , which fuses the ha protein to the rest of the virion; the receptor binding domain, which binds to sialic acid receptors in host cells, and the vestigial esterase domain, whose metabolic role is redundant but which has been speculated to play some part in membrane fusion activity of modern-day influenza viruses
 <cit> .

the largest number of sites under putative positive selection was observed on the n <dig> na background . this was approximately twice the number of sites with a mean dn/ds >  <dig> on n <dig>  n <dig> or n <dig> backgrounds . when the largest  <dig> mean dn/ds values across the ha <dig> codon sites were ordered by magnitude for each na background subtype, the dn/ds value on the n <dig> background was higher than the dn/ds value of that rank on all other na subtype backgrounds . the large dn/ds values observed at individual codon sites for h <dig> ha <dig> on the n <dig> na background would have led to the elevated ha1-wide dn/ds observed on the n <dig> na background; however, h7n <dig> also had many of the smallest dn/ds values out of the different subtypes at individual amino acid sites . for all na subtype backgrounds, sites with mean dn/ds >  <dig> were observed in each of the fusion, vestigial esterase and receptor binding domains.

although high dn/ds values were observed at two sites in the signal peptide region of h <dig> ha on na backgrounds n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  no sites with mean dn/ds >  <dig> were observed for the h <dig> ha signal peptide region on the n <dig> na background. the signal peptide region appears to have been considered in previous gene-wide or ha1-wide calculations of dn/ds , and the values we have reported across the alignment encompass the signal peptide and ha <dig>  note that we observed the same general pattern of average dn/ds across sites for h <dig> avian influenza on different na backgrounds  when averaging across just the ha <dig> coding region, i.e. excluding the signal peptide region .

some commonality was observed between the h <dig> ha <dig> sites with mean dn/ds >  <dig> on different na subtype backgrounds. one site  had mean dn/ds >  <dig> on all four na subtype backgrounds;  <dig> amino acid sites had mean dn/ds >  <dig> on  <dig> out of the four na subtype backgrounds and  <dig> sites had mean dn/ds >  <dig> in two out of the four background na subtypes . site  <dig> has been linked with receptor-binding specificity
 <cit>  and thus high levels of non-synonymous change at this site could signify a move towards viruses which are capable of infecting other host species.

of the  <dig> h7n <dig> ha <dig> sequences studied,  <dig> were from viruses circulating in the north american live bird markets between  <dig> and  <dig>  or from the many avian influenza outbreaks they seeded in commercial poultry in the northeast united states during this period
 <cit> . it may also be noted that 88% of the north american h7n <dig> sequences possessed a deletion of  <dig> amino acids at the ha receptor binding site, and a recent study has put forward the idea that non-synonymous changes might have occurred in the ha to maintain functionality
 <cit> . this would be compatible with our observation that a large number of sites with mean dn/ds >  <dig> were found in the receptor binding domain for h <dig> ha on the n <dig> na background . if the elevated level of non-synonymous change only applied to h7n <dig> ha <dig> lineages associated with the receptor binding site deletion then our results could also be compatible with this hypothesis. it is possible that molecular changes at, or adjacent to, other sites in the receptor binding region  could be compensating for the ha deletion. although this could indicate co-evolution at sites within the ha, again this could be to restore ha activity levels to match those of the na.

h7n <dig> was the most common avian influenza subtype isolated from the north american live bird markets between  <dig> and 2006
 <cit> , garnering attention as a potential source for a human pandemic virus
 <cit>  after it proved capable of causing limited human infection
 <cit> . north american h7n <dig> viruses isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> were found to exhibit increased affinity towards human-like α- <dig> -linked sialic acid receptors
 <cit>  which has also been associated with adaptation to certain terrestrial birds, such as chickens and quails
 <cit> . while  north american h7n <dig> only presented in a low pathogenic form, molecular evidence suggested a step-wise accumulation of basic amino acids at the north american h7n <dig> ha cleavage site towards those observed in highly pathogenic viruses
 <cit> . an elevated level of non-synonymous change amongst circulating avian influenza viruses could signify a heightened risk of molecular changes occurring which would increase the pathogenicity of the virus, or its ability to infect new species and become transmissible amongst humans. although h7n <dig> avian influenza appeared to have been eradicated from domestic poultry in north america by mid-2006
 <cit> , such findings might be particularly pertinent if the strain re-emerges.

advantages of stochastic mutational mapping for calculating dn/ds
our stochastic mutational mapping method for calculating the dn/ds ratio provides many advantages for investigating selective pressure in influenza ha on different na subtype backgrounds in the presence of reassortment. by using the rescalings described in methods, we are able to estimate rates of synonymous substitution  and non-synonymous substitution , rather than merely counting the number of synonymous or non-synonymous changes along branches
 <cit> . also, estimating dn and ds separately allowed us to attribute differences in the dn/ds ratio to underlying differences in the non-synonymous or synonymous rate. our method also enabled us to estimate dn and ds along parts of the ha tree corresponding to different na subtype backgrounds, despite sequences from viruses with different na subtypes being distributed across the tree; this does not require the introduction of additional model parameters, but merely summarizes the relevant lineages. finally, our rescalings allowed dn and ds to be compared between clades of different sizes and divergence.

bayesian methods for phylogenetic inference and mutational mapping provide an advantage over parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods since they naturally accommodate uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction  and the mutational history . failing to account for phylogenetic uncertainty can lead to artificially narrow confidence intervals for estimating substitution rates
 <cit> . we note that, whilst the topologies and relative branch lengths are consistent between our maximum likelihood and bayesian phylogenies, the mrbayes trees had longer branch lengths. this is likely to be due to a known artefact of mrbayes
 <cit> ; however, our dn/ds estimates for h <dig> ha are consistent with those from a previous study
 <cit>  which used different phylogenetic inference methods.

another advantage over parsimony is that non-parsimonious maps are not automatically excluded. using parsimony to minimise the number of mutations required to produce the observed pattern in the data can lead to an underestimate in substitution rates, perhaps by a factor of over 20%, and can also bias dn/ds estimates by underestimating the number of synonymous changes in scenarios where synonymous mutations occur more frequently than non-synonymous mutations
 <cit> .

in addition to the ability to use a collection of trees and sample multiple mutational histories, our mutational mapping method also possessed advantages over the paml maximum likelihood software
 <cit> . although paml can be used to estimate dn/ds along the branches of a phylogeny
 <cit> , its use in our study would have led to an over-parameterised model with very little power for statistical testing using likelihood ratio tests, since parameters would be estimated for each branch in the tree. furthermore, with stochastic mutational mapping we did not have to pre-specify branches with potentially positively-selected sites, which is a requirement of the branch-site models in paml. in addition, paml assigns dn/ds values for branches to a pre-determined number of rate classes , which would lead to a loss of precision compared to the stochastic mutational mapping approach. mutational mapping also records the timings of mutations across the tree, which we have used in calculating evolutionary rates, whereas existing maximum likelihood methods do not.

evolutionary implications
assuming that all synonymous changes are essentially neutral, ds is independent of the effective size  of the population and is simply the mutation rate
 <cit> , although synonymous rates in rna viruses can be affected by the virus’ secondary structure
 <cit> . our finding that ds for h <dig> influenza ha <dig> did not vary across different na subtype backgrounds therefore suggested that the mutation rate was constant for h <dig> ha <dig> across na subtype backgrounds.

under non-neutral models of evolution, differences in selective pressure could lead to differences between substitution rates
 <cit> . since non-synonymous changes in the ha <dig> coding region are likely to be non-neutral, the elevated dn observed for avian influenza h <dig> ha <dig> on an n <dig> na subtype background might be explained by a number of scenarios. firstly, selection could be acting to fine-tune the functional ha-na balance of h <dig> ha on an n <dig> na background following reassortment. secondly, a burst of positive selection could have occurred in the h7n <dig> lineages, which is not a consequence of the n <dig> na background, but instead a consequence of an unrelated, co-varying factor such as avian host, demographic scenario, or an interaction with another gene segment. thirdly, a relaxation of selective constraint could have taken place when h <dig> ha was exposed to the n <dig> na background. the results of this study do not definitively distinguish between such scenarios and causality cannot be inferred. however, whilst dn/ds >  <dig> was observed in a larger number of ha <dig> sites on the n <dig> na background than on n <dig>  n <dig> or n <dig> backgrounds, at many sites the n <dig> viruses also had the lowest dn/ds values out of all na subtype backgrounds  and this is not indicative of an overall relaxation of selective constraint. one explanation for the observed pattern of site-by-site dn/ds values could be a larger effective population size in ha for the h7n <dig> viruses, which would allow selection to act more effectively in removing deleterious mutations, leading to a reduction of variation at some sites.

the results presented in this study are consistent with the hypothesis that reassortment exposes ha to significant changes in selective forces via association with different na subtypes. however, establishing a causal relationship between background na subtype and differences in evolutionary rates of ha is not straightforward. mutational mapping analyses excluded underlying differences in evolutionary rates between viruses of different pathogenicity, or between different avian host orders, as causative factors in the elevated dn/ds observed in h7n <dig> avian influenza ha <dig>  nonetheless, other differences between the environments from which sequences were isolated may have influenced the selective pressure experienced. for example, it has been suggested that long term evolution in commercial poultry, which are not the natural reservoir of avian influenza, could lead to accelerated rates of evolution and the accumulation of point mutations in viruses in the live bird markets
 <cit> .

although we cannot exclude prolonged circulation of avian influenza viruses in non-natural avian hosts as a factor in observing an elevated dn/ds for h <dig> ha on an n <dig> na background, it can be noted that 66% of the h7n <dig> sequences we analysed were sampled during an outbreak of lp and hp h7n <dig> avian influenza in domestic poultry in italy, and that the elevated dn/ds did not appear to extend to this subtype background. however, italian h7n <dig> sequences were sampled over a period of less than two years, compared to over  <dig> years for h7n <dig> in the north american live bird markets. the effect of continuous circulation amongst non-natural avian hosts on selective pressure could be investigated in h5n <dig> avian influenza, which is endemic in the live bird markets of east asia
 <cit> . given detailed information about the origin of the avian hosts from which viruses were collected, dn/ds could also be compared along lineages corresponding to wild or domestic avian hosts.

future studies could investigate rate variation along individual branches of the h <dig> ha <dig> phylogeny to determine whether the elevated dn/ds extends to all lineages on the n <dig> na subtype background , or whether it is localised to particular parts of the tree . further analyses could also consider whether the elevated dn/ds observed for h7n <dig> ha <dig> also extends to other segments, for example whether the na for these viruses showed higher levels of non-synonymous change than the na sequences for the h7n <dig>  h7n <dig> or h7n <dig> viruses. other investigations could consider interactions with other influenza proteins, such as the matrix protein, with which the ha and na both interact closely. the precise nature of the genetic changes which take place when ha is placed in a novel na background  could also be explored in the laboratory using reverse genetics experiments, to provide an insight into how the balance between ha and na activity is regulated.

future influenza modelling studies could explicitly incorporate genetic interactions between segments, rather than assuming that their evolution is independent. such effects might be included in extensions to frameworks such as that of zhang et al.
 <cit> , who model the impact of reassortment on the dynamics of novel human influenza strains. although much modelling work has focused on human influenza rather than avian influenza, a recent study suggested that evolutionary changes mediating the ha-na functional balance were an important determinant of the transmissibility of the  <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic influenza strain
 <cit> , thus our result might find application in models of the emergence and spread of zoonotic influenza strains in human populations.

CONCLUSIONS
reassortment of avian influenza segments creates novel combinations of influenza genes and repeatedly exposes segments to different genetic backgrounds. our study has shown that the selective pressure experienced by the influenza ha can vary depending upon the genetic context in which a segment finds itself. in this case, the average dn/ds across avian influenza ha <dig> of subtype h <dig> differed according to the background na subtype of the virus. observed differences in selective pressure could not be accounted for by differences in the pathogenicity of the virus, or the taxonomic order of the avian host from which it was sampled. we believe that future influenza modelling studies could incorporate epistatic interactions between gene segments, for example when considering the impact of reassortment on the emergence dynamics of novel strains.
