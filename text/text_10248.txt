BACKGROUND
the fet-protein family comprises fus ), ews  and taf <dig>   <cit> . the fet-proteins are implicated in cancer and originally identified as n-terminal partners of different fusion oncoproteins . fet-proteins are also involved in neurological diseases with fus and taf <dig> mutations identified in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  , frontotemporal lobar degeneration   <cit>  and essential tremor disorders  <cit> .

fet-proteins are expressed in most human tissues and cell types  <cit> . the fet-proteins are composed of several conserved domains: sygq-rich n-terminal domain, g-rich domain, rna-binding domain , zn-finger, and c-terminal rgg-rich domain  <cit> . the n-terminal region of fet-proteins has a transcriptional trans-activating function and is involved in homo and hetero dimerization  <cit> . the c-terminal region is involved in subcellular localization and constitutes a hot spot for mutations associated with als and ftld . fet-proteins shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and have a c-terminal nuclear localization signal  <cit> . cellular stress, as well as fus and taf <dig> mutations present in als and ftld, results in cytoplasmic aggregation, appearing as immune reactive inclusion bodies in cultured cells and brain tissue. the inclusion body formation is concomitant with less nuclear fus and taf <dig> content  <cit> . the central and c-terminal protein regions including the rrm, zn-finger and rgg-rich domains are implicated in rna- and dna-binding . fet-protein rna target identification showed binding to thousands of rna species and fet-proteins are functionally involved in transcriptional regulation, mrna splicing and polyadenylation, rna transport, rna translation and microrna  processing . fet-proteins associate with a number of factors involved in transcription and rna processing, such as rna polymerase ii , the basal transcriptional regulatory complex transcription factor iid , and splice and polyadenylation factors . moreover, fet-proteins are present in the drosha mirna processing complex  <cit> . fus and ews have also been described playing a role in dna repair. fus and ews deficient mice and zebra fish show defects in dna pairing and dna repair  and the fet-proteins are able to pair homologous dna in vitro . the pleiotropic functions of ews and fus are further illustrated by the role of fus in dna damage responses  <cit> . fus is rapidly recruited to sites of double strand breaks in a poly polymerase dependent manner and fus depletion diminishes double strand break repair through both homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining  <cit> . furthermore, in response to dna damage, fus binds to a non-coding rna transcribed upstream of the cyclin d <dig>  gene, which leads to the inhibition of the histone acetyltransferase activities of creb-binding and p <dig> proteins, thereby repressing ccnd <dig> transcription  <cit> . rna mediated recruitment of fus to promoter regions goes beyond mechanisms directly related to dna repair, and i.e. it was shown that in cortical neurons fus binds the antisense rna strand at the promoter region for a large set of genes and this results in transcriptional suppression of the coding strand  <cit> . other studies have shown transcriptional regulation by fus through promoter association such as involvement in the regulation of rnapii c-terminal domain ser <dig> phosphorylation and accordingly rnapii accumulation at transcriptional start sites  <cit> . this is functional linked with downstream poly-signal selection in a process also dependent on fus recruitment to the nascent rna  <cit> . fus was also shown to activate transcription of genes related to oxidative stress defense through promoter binding  <cit> .

considering the fundamental roles the fet-proteins seem to play in normal cellular functions as well as in different types of human diseases, it will be important to elucidate the different mechanisms underlying the function of these proteins. in this study we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing  to identify potential binding sites of fus and ews at the chromatin level. the results show that fus and ews bind downstream the poly-signal in a subset of transcribed genes, that target genes are enriched for functions related to various aspects of rna regulation, and that, for at least some of these genes, fus and ews have rna processing functions.

RESULTS
identification of fus and ews genome-wide dna binding sites
a hallmark of the fet-proteins is their ability to bind nucleic acids including rnas as well as single and double stranded dna  <cit> . to identify target genes for fus and ews we conducted chip-seq analysis using human hek- <dig> cells. we selected hek- <dig> cells since genomics and rnomics studies at the time of our experimentation have used this genetic background to dissect regulatory functions of fus and ews, thereby allowing comparative analyses. the selected fus and ews monoclonal antibodies precipitated the expected proteins in cross-linked cell samples without any detectable cross-reactivity. following chip, the eluted dna fragments were subjected to next generation sequencing  using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. an equivalent amount of input dna was used for ngs as a negative control and acetylated lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  was included as a positive control for actively transcribed genes.  <dig> sequence reads were extracted for each sample. the obtained raw sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome  using burrows-wheeler aligner  <cit> . for the three chip samples, over 94 % of the sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome . aligned sequence reads were further processed with macs  <dig> .0rc <dig> for peaks calling  <cit> . a significant peak was defined using the criteria of a threshold ≥  <dig> reads and p-value ≤ 10− <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> enrichment peaks were significant for fus and ews, respectively, and of these  <dig> fus peaks and  <dig> ews peaks were positioned inside or proximate  annotated genes . we in the following focused on such peaks and characterized the distribution over target genes for the ews and fus peaks. we reasoned that if a peak is positioned within or in proximity of several genes, each of these genes should be encountered potential target genes . using this approach,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were scored positive for fus, ews and ac-h3k <dig>  respectively . it should be noted that since it is the distribution of chip peaks per annotated gene present in ucsc, each chip peak can results in multiple hits. therefore, the numerical sum of the presented hits is accordingly not equal to the number of peaks. a more detailed analysis of the position of peaks revealed that a large proportion of fus ) and ews ) peaks are located downstream the poly-signal in target genes . the remaining enrichment peaks for fus and ews were localized in the upstream region , inside introns  and within exons . we note that ac-h3k <dig> peaks more often localized upstream of genes and in introns and exons, whereas only a smaller number  were assigned to localize downstream the poly-signal .fig.  <dig> chip-seq profile of fus and ews binding sites in the human genome. a total number of chip-seq reads and the chip-seq reads mapped to the human genome for ngs sequenced samples. b distribution in a gene based model of fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig> peaks in or nearby  genes. upstream region  is defined as until 10 kb upstream of annotated gene transcriptional start sites, downstream region  is defined as until 10 kb downstream of annotated gene poly-signals, upstream + downstream  specifies a chromosomal localization in where a peak is until 10 kb upstream for one gene but at the same time downstream of a neighboring gene, exon , intron , and exon and intron . the location is defined accordingly to the summit of a given peak. c position binding profile of fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig> based on a transcript based model in where each annotated transcript with a fus, ews, or ac-h3k <dig> peak, the peak is localized accordingly to the gene model illustrated in the upper left corner including the features upstream , exon/intron , and downstream , and each feature further subdivided in smaller segments. the y-axis represents the number of times  each chip-seq peaks map to annotated ucsc gene transcripts at the given segment position in the feature. since multiple annotated transcripts often appear from one gene due to alternative splicing and promoter usage each chip-seq peak can generate several hits. the location is defined accordingly to the summit of the given chip-seq peaks

gene distributions were subdivided into six groups: exon, intron, exon + intron , upstream , downstream , and upstream + downstream. the latter specifies a chromosomal localization in where a peak is until 10 kb upstream for one gene but at the same time downstream of a neighboring gene



to identify the pathways to which fus and ews target genes belongs we performed a gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways analysis using the software chip-enrich specifically developed for gene set enrichment testing of chip-seq results  <cit> . for these analyses we used a cut-off fdr <  <dig> . the most significant results are presented in table  <dig> and the complete output in additional file  <dig>  chip-enrich analysis revealed that for both fus and ews the most enriched kegg pathway is ribosome  . the most enriched go biological process for both fus and ews is translational elongation . additionally, a prominent enrichment of regulatory processes at the rna level was observed within the go cellular component for fus. the  <dig> most significant enriched gene sets were heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, cytosolic ribosome, ribonucleoprotein complex, ribosomal subunit, and cytosolic large ribosomal subunit . four of these five gene sets were also among the five most significant ews go cellular component gene sets . inspection of the entire fus and ews chip-enrich analysis revealed existence of many additional go enriched gene sets involved in regulatory processes at the rna level .table  <dig> chip-enrich analysis of fus and ews chip-seq peaks

the presented chip-enrich results represents for fus the  <dig> most significant go signatures for biological process and for cellular component, as well as the single present go signature for molecular function and kegg pathway. for comparison the same set-up for chip-enrich results were presented for ews. the entire chip-enrich analyze list is included in additional file 4




to illustrate by an alternative approach the position of fus and ews chip-seq peaks we next used a transcript based model in which each annotated transcript was analyzed for the presence of fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig> peaks within or in close distance to the transcript . the location of such peaks was mapped relative to a standard gene model consisting of four genetic features: upstream , exon and intron, as well as downstream representing a location after the poly-signal . each of these features was sub-divided into  <dig> segments for more precise mapping. as shown in figure 1c, fus and ews preferentially bind the feature downstream of the poly-signal. it should again be noted that, since it is the distribution of chip peaks per annotated gene transcript present in ucsc, each chip peak can result in multiple hits. fig 1c also illustrates that ac-h3k <dig> chip peaks, if designated to the upstream feature mostly correspond to the 3’ end of this feature, and if chip-peaks are designated to exons and introns feature, the peaks mostly correspond to the 5’ end of this feature. this is in accordance with ac-h3k <dig> being a mark for transcriptional start sites. examples of fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig> enrichment peaks are shown for the acpt and c19orf <dig> gene complex , rcc <dig> and snhg <dig> gene complex , and hnrnpk gene  . the read number is shown at the left axis of each figure. the scale difference for the ac-h3k <dig> chip-seq enrichment  should be noted. the transcripts from ucsc hg <dig> genomic database are shown at the bottom. chip-seq results were validated by repeated chip experiments and analysis of representative genomic regions by quantitative pcr  .fig.  <dig> graphical illustrations of representative chip-seq results. chip-seq sequence reads for input, fus, ews, ac-h3k <dig> and rnapii were aligned to representative genes by integrative genomics viewer  <dig> . the number of sequence reads is presented on the y-axis within each figure. transcripts from the ucsc hg <dig> genomic database are shown in the bottom section of each figure. a chip-seq reads aligned to the neighboring acpt and c19orf <dig> genes. b chip-seq reads aligned to the overlapping rcc <dig> and snhg <dig> genes with additional inclusion of snora73a and snora73b genes. we note the presence of major fus and ews peaks corresponding to the position of the annotated poly-signal of snhg <dig> as well as minor fus and ews peaks 4 kb further 3’ end positioned. c chip-seq reads aligned to the hnrnpk gene with additional inclusion of mir-7- <dig>  dashed lines separate the paired input, ac-h3k <dig>  fus and ews chip seq dataset from the paired input and rnapii chip-seq dataset. red arrows show positions of primers used for qpcr based verification of chip results. blue arrows under gene names show direction of transcription



fus and ews bind actively transcribed genes
cross comparison of the identified target genes for fus and ac-h3k <dig> showed that out of  <dig> genes with fus binding assigned,  <dig> were also enriched for ac-h3k <dig>  indicating that most fus target genes are actively transcribed . the same was observed for ews target genes, since out of  <dig> genes with ews binding assigned,  <dig> were also enriched for ac-h3k <dig> . further analysis of fus and ews chip-seq peaks revealed that a large proportion of target genes were bound by both fus and ews . to validate if fus and ews target genes represented actively transcribed genes, we compared our chip-seq datasets with mrna expression analyses previously conducted in hek- <dig> cells  <cit> . we analyzed the expression profile of targeted genes in two dna microarray datasets . among the  <dig>  probe sets representing  <dig>  unique genes in the illumina gpl <dig> microarray, we identified  <dig> probe sets representing chip-seq target genes for fus and ac-h3k <dig>   <dig> probe sets for ews and ac-h3k <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets for fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig> . in addition, we identified  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> probe sets representing the chip-seq targeted genes with binding of fus, ews, or both, respectively, in the absence of ac-h3k <dig> . we note that the transcripts presented on the microarray are enriched for mrna with protein coding potential and thereby most ncrnas are excluded from our analyses. by comparing the relative expression level of fus, ews, or fus and ews target genes with or without ac-h3k <dig>  an active transcriptional status could be attributed to target genes . the number of fus target genes without ac-h3k <dig> was very low  which most likely explains the lack of significant change in expression levels between fus target genes without ac-h3k <dig> relative to the fus and ac-h3k <dig> target genes . a control set of  <dig> randomized selected probes representing the microarray was less expressed than probe sets with fus and ac-h3k <dig>  as well as ews and ac-h3k <dig>  further supporting that fus and ews target genes are actively transcribed . we performed go analysis of the above described probe set groups representing actively transcribed genes with chip-seq peaks of fus, ews and ac-h3k <dig> . we note that this go analysis is not directly comparable with the chip-enrich analysis presented in table  <dig> due to different grouping and definition of input genes. nevertheless, consistence with the chip-enrich analysis was evident . for ews and ac-h3k <dig> probe set group the most significant go biological process was translational elongation and go molecular function was rna binding . for the fus and ac-h3k <dig> probe set we note that there was significant enrichment for go cellular component gene sets representing cytosolic ribosome, ribosomal subunit, and cytosolic large ribosomal subunit, which were also detected by chip-enrich. for the probe set representing fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig> target genes we observed enrichment of go gene sets including go molecular function rna binding and several enriched gene sets related to ribonucleotide binding, as well as the go biological processes gene-expression and translation .fig.  <dig> characterization of fus and ews target genes. a the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes identified as potential targets for fus, ews or ac-h3k <dig>  respectively, were in addition examined for also the presence of peaks representing the two other chip-seq experiments. b the percentage distribution of genes with either individual or combined fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig> peaks. percentages were calculated from the numbers in

we further compared the actively transcribed gene groups fus and ac-h3k <dig>  ews and ac-h3k <dig>  and fus, ews, and ac-h3k <dig>  with microarray datasets representing hek- <dig> cells with sirna mediated depletion of fus, ews, or a combined fus and ews depletion   <cit> . few of the transcribed ews and fus target genes had altered transcription as a consequence of ews and fus depletion, suggesting that the binding of ews and fus to target genes is not essential for the given transcriptional level .

accumulation of rnapii in the downstream region of genes has been described to be relatively common  <cit> . considering that fus and ews largely target genes that are actively transcribed, we hypothesized that fus and ews binding downstream the poly-signal could be associated with rnapii accumulation. to investigate this, we calculated the distance between rnapii and fus or ews peaks downstream the poly-signal. rnapii genomic occupancy profile in hek- <dig> cells was obtained from encode chip-seq data and fus and ews chip-seq peaks located downstream the poly-signal is presented in additional file  <dig>  the analysis showed that fus and ews binding overlaps to rnapii binding, supporting that binding of fus and ews downstream from the last exon is associated with rnapii accumulation . we next examined whether fus and ews chip-seq peaks were intersecting  with rnapii chip-seq peaks. fus and ews chip-seq peaks were categorized accordingly to their gene localization as upstream, exon, intron, or downstream . note that one chip-seq peak can belong to several categories. the intersection analyses showed that in all fus peak categories, most peaks intersected with rnapii binding . for fus peaks, the most prominent intersection with rnapii peaks was for peaks localized downstream  . for ews peaks, we observed a general lower intersection with rnapii peaks . nevertheless, we also observed for ews peaks a prominent intersection between peaks localizing downstream and rnapii peaks  . thus, we conclude that fus and ews binding downstream the poly-signal often associates with rnapii accumulation at the same position. extending the analyses to also examine for intersection of fus and ews chip-seq peaks, we observed peak intersections within all localization categories . this is in alignment with the previous presented results showing that fus and ews have a common group of target genes .fig.  <dig> ews and fus binding downstream the poly-signal overlap with rnapii binding. a the distance in base pairs  for the  <dig> fus gene localized and the  <dig> fus downstream localized chip-seq peaks , as well as for the  <dig> ews gene localized and the  <dig> ews downstream localized chip-seq peaks , to rnapii binding . distances were plotted as histograms, where x =  <dig> indicate the center of rnapii binding. the y-axis show the number of fus and ews chip-seq peaks in each bar. b presentation of the percentage of fus  and ews  chip-seq peaks, both for the total number of gene localized peaks, as well as peaks belonging to different categories for gene localization, intersecting at least one base with rnapii peaks. c presentation of the percentage of fus and ews chip-seq peaks, both for the total number of gene localized peaks, as well as peaks belonging to different categories for gene localization, that intersect . at the right side is shown the coloring code for the intersection percentages. the percentage of fus, ews, and rnapii intersection with a randomized generated peak set was <  <dig>  % based on  <dig> x  <dig> simulations of the randomized peaks having the same length and chromosome distribution as the rnapii chip-seq peaks yielding a significance level of p <  <dig> x 10−5




functional analysis of exemplified fus and ews chip-seq peaks
to investigate the functional implications of ews and fus binding in representative genes, we performed depletion of fus, ews or both, by transfecting hek- <dig> cells with sirna. depletion efficiency was determined at both mrna and protein levels by qpcr and western blot . firstly, we analyzed the genomic region annotated with c19orf <dig> and acpt genes. for c19orf <dig>  ews, fus, and rnapii chip-seq peaks were detected downstream the poly-signal, as well as having ac-h3k <dig> and rnapii chip-seq peaks at the promoter region . we note that the acpt gene, which directly overlaps with the fus and ews chip-seq peaks, but not ac-h3k <dig>  was not expressed to a detectable level in hek- <dig> cells, either with or without fus and ews depletion, decreasing the likelihood that acpt represents a functional ews and fus target gene . to determine the eventual functional effects of fus and ews, we next examined by rt-qpcr the expression levels of c19orf <dig> isoforms, c19orf <dig> intron retention, and amounts of the snord <dig> precursors generated from c19orf <dig> intron sequences. the results showed that fus and ews depletion had no direct effect on the expression of the examined rna species using a significance threshold of  <dig>  fold changes . we next analyzed the overlapping rcc <dig> and snhg <dig> gene complex . we note the presence of major fus and ews enrichment corresponding to the position of the annotated poly-signal of snhg <dig>  as well as minor fus and ews peaks approximately 4 kb further downstream . the rcc1-gene has different mrna isoforms due to alternative transcription start sites and/or alternative splicing . the rcc <dig> downstream transcription start site is located after rcc <dig> exon  <dig> and displays overlapping ac-h3k <dig> and rnapii enrichment peaks indicating active transcription . the rcc <dig> upstream transcription start site overlaps with the transcription start site of snhg <dig> gene, which is a non-coding gene. the first two exons of the large forms of rcc <dig> and snhg <dig> mrnas are identical and two snhg <dig> mrna isoforms can be produced from rcc <dig>  this transcriptional start site also contains overlapping enrichment peaks for ac-h3k <dig> and rnapii . additionally, two small nucleolar rna precursors, snora73a and snora73b, are produced from the introns of rcc <dig> and snhg <dig> genes . rt-qpcr was used to investigate if the various rcc <dig>  snhg <dig> and snora <dig> rna isoforms generated from this genomic region were affected by depletion of fus and ews. the only significant change observed was reduction in rcc <dig> transcripts initiated from the upstream transcription start site in fus depleted cells . finally, we analyzed the hnrnpk gene, with fus and ews binding downstream of the poly-signal . distinct hnrnpk mrna isoforms are produced by usage of two alternative first exons, as well as alternative splice acceptor sites at the last exon . moreover, one of the microrna precursors of mir7- <dig> is generated from hnrnpk intron  <dig>  the expression levels of hnrnpk transcripts were not significantly changed by ews and fus depletion . to evaluate fus and ews effect on alternative splicing involving exon  <dig>  rt-pcr followed by gel electrophoresis was performed. two bands with distinct sizes were observed for both coupled and individual fus and ews depletions as well as for control, reflecting the usage of proximal  and distal  acceptor sites . fus and ews depletion caused a significant increase of hnrnpk transcripts, which used the distal exon  <dig> splice acceptor site  .fig.  <dig> fus and ews influence hnrnpk splice site selection. a graphical illustration of hnrnpk alternative splice acceptor site selection in exon  <dig>  p, proximal splice site; d, distal splice site. on top are indicated the coding region in gray and positions of translational stop  and poly-signal . b rt-pcr and gel electrophoresis of siews, sifus, siews and sifus, and sicontrol depleted hek- <dig> cells. this image is representative of  <dig> independent experiments. m, 100 bp dna ladder. –rt, negative control of pcr mix without template cdna. c ratio of d  to p  splice acceptor site usage in sirna transfected cells. the ratio was calculated from relative band intensity values by gelquant software. the ratio for sicon was given the value  <dig> and the ratios from sirna-depleted samples were calculated accordingly. experiments were performed in biological triplicates. data presented as mean + sem



discussion
the coupling of transcription with rna processing is widely accepted and, in recent years, it has become more evident that the functional importance of fus and ews may reside in this interface. several studies have addressed the association of fus and ews with rna. however, despite early in vitro evidence for the dna-binding properties of the fet-proteins  <cit> , few studies identifying in situ target genes for fus and ews have been conducted  <cit> . we here present a profile for genomic binding of fus and ews by chip-seq in hek- <dig> cells. to our knowledge this is the first presentation of ews chip-seq data whereas one fus chip-seq and one fus chip-chip dataset were previously published  <cit> . our studies were conducted in hek- <dig> cells since other fus and ews rnomics and genomics studies, including genome-wide rna binding analysis and fus chip-seq analysis, have used the hek- <dig> genetic background to dissect the regulatory functions. thereby, cross-experimental comparative analyses are possible by minimizing potential interference from cell line genetic differences and cell type specific gene expression profiles. nevertheless, we acknowledge that use of the single hek- <dig> cell line model has limitations in terms of delineating the general biological implications of the identified fus and ews gene binding profiles. it will be informative to extend fus and ews chip-seq profiling to other cell models to study the protein functions in more details and in relation to specific diseases involving fus and ews deregulation, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

we identified a small number of significant peaks for fus  and ews . of these peaks,  <dig> for fus and  <dig> for ews were located within or in close proximity  of annotated genes. given that one peak at a given genomic position often can be assigned to more than one annotated gene,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as potential targets for fus and ews, respectively. interestingly,  <dig> genes were common in situ targets for fus and ews. moreover, our peak intersection analysis showed that fus and ews chip-seq peaks often overlap, which altogether supports a functional cooperation or redundancy of these proteins. this observation correlates with previous descriptions of fus and ews being together in protein complexes  <cit> . the hereby identified binding of fus and ews to genes in hek- <dig> cells could be directly mediated through multiple nucleic acid interaction domains in ews and fus, or indirect as cross linking in the chip protocol strengthens protein-protein and tripartite protein-rna-dna interactions. in our study 16 % of fus and 20 % of ews enrichment peaks were in the upstream gene region including the promoter. fus and ews were reported to both enhance and inhibit transcription, being a common characteristic of these studies the binding of fus and ews mainly at the promoter region . additionally, genome-wide rna cross-linking and ip  analysis has shown that fus interacts with antisense rna originating from promoter regions  <cit> . this fus-rna interaction mediates transcriptional down regulation from the coding strand, indicating a function of fus in transcription in a position-dependent manner  <cit> . schwarts et al. showed that fus binds the c-terminal domain  of rnapii, preventing inappropriate ctd ser- <dig> hyperphosphorylation at thousands of human genes  <cit> . fus depletion caused rnapii accumulation at the transcription start site and a shift in the corresponding mrna expression profile towards usage of early poly-signals  <cit> . fus chip-seq analyses in hek- <dig> cells by schwarts et al. showed binding of fus to the transcriptional start site  in 68 % of transcribed genes, concomitant with rnapii presence  <cit> . this contrasts with our chip-seq data, where promoter and 5’ gene region binding of fus only constitutes a minor proportion of the fus in situ targets. we here also note that a fus chip-chip experiment by tan et al. identified direct fus interaction to promoter sequences in hela cells  <cit> . whereas tan et al. data were not straightforward comparable with our results due to different sample genetics and chip methodology, a dataset comparison with fus chip-seq data from schwarts et al. was more straightforward  <cit> . the chip-seq experiment by schwarts et al. was performed in hek-293 t/ <dig> cells and our study in the parental hek- <dig> cell line. in chip-seq data analysis we have compared input dna sequences versus fus chip dna sequences whereas schwarts et al. compared fus chip dna sequences generated from cells either pre-transfected with a scrambled sirna control or sirna against fus with the latter chip-seq only resulted in relative few sequence reads which could be mapped to hg <dig> . secondly, schwarts et al. used the peak-calling software findpeaks, whereas we used macs, with only macs also using input dna sequence data for peak estimation . we reanalyzed our and schwarts et al. fus chip-seq data with the findpeaks and macs peak calling programs. the p-value distribution for called peaks was similar between the two datasets using macs, whereas when using findpeaks a high proportion of the peaks called from schwarts et al. data clustered with high p-value . the distribution of macs and findpeaks called peaks over a model gene was next analyzed using a serial decrease in p-value cut-off levels. using macs peak calling, fus chip-seq peaks corresponding to promoter regions were identified in our data, but not in numerical alignment with schwarts et al., which described preferential promoter association to thousands of genes . moreover, macs identified in both datasets a small number of fus chip-seq peaks downstream the poly-signal . using findpeaks peak calling, fus chip-seq peaks corresponding to promoter association to thousands of genes were identified only in schwarts et al. data, and preferentially with high p-values . moreover, using findpeaks identified in our and schwarts et al. datasets a small number of fus chip-seq peaks downstream the poly-signal . we conclude that overall discrepancies in obtained results seem to be a combination of the dna co-immunoprecipitated under the given chip experimental conditions, criteria used for peak calling, and that the small number of downstream the poly-signal peaks do not appear evident in the schwarts et al. study given the much larger fus enrichment at promoter regions. however, we find it important that the identification of fus and ews binding downstream the poly-signal of a small subset of transcribed target genes irrespectively of peak calling methods and sequence datasets, indicates an overseen putative regulatory mechanism for gene targeting of fus and ews with potential implications for regulation at the rna level.

rna processing factors can be recruited to transcribed genes in multiple, not mutually exclusive, ways: i) by binding to the dna template either directly or through recruiting factors, ii) by binding to processing signals present in the nascent rna and iii) by binding to defined regions of the rnapii elongating complex i.e. ctd  <cit> . in mammals, rnapii transcriptional termination can occur anywhere from a few bases to several kb downstream from the poly-signal  <cit> . previous studies have revealed a general higher average rnapii density downstream from the poly-signal compared to the transcribed region  <cit> . however, a subsequent study proposed that these observations were biased, considering that most active genes have rnapii evenly distributed before and after the poly-signal, but that a subset of actively transcribed genes  contained rnapii enrichment downstream the poly-signal  <cit> . association of 3’-end processing factors, capping factors, spt <dig>  and ser- <dig> hyper-phosphorylated paused rnapii was identified approximately  <dig> - <dig>  kb downstream of the poly-signal  <cit> . the cdk <dig> kinase component of p-tefb, which mediates rnapii ctd ser- <dig> phosphorylation, is also present downstream of the poly-signal and this is being coupled with correct assembly of the spliceosome  <cit> . thus, rnapii pausing downstream of the poly-signal, transcription termination and pre-mrna processing seems to be highly interconnected. a link to transcriptional re-initiation is also opened  <cit> . go analysis showed that genes with and without downstream rnapii enrichment are implicated in different cellular functions  <cit> . it has been shown that fus and ews interact with different spliceosome components but also with rnapii and tfiid  <cit> . in this line, ews is shown to function as a co-transcriptional regulator of alternative splicing which can bind alternatively spliced exons at both the chromatin template level and in the nucleoplasm  <cit> . fus rna-clip analyses showed widespread cross-linking along the whole length of associated pre-rnas, suggesting that fus associates with target rnas until splicing is completed . so far, simple rna binding motifs which could explain rna-binding patterns of ews and fus have not been identified, but a preference for gu-rich motifs and short-stem loops was proposed to facilitate binding  <cit> . the hereby described binding of fus and ews downstream the poly-signal of actively transcribed genes often overlaps rnapii binding, and this could be mechanistically linked with the gene recruitment process of fus and ews. comparative analysis of the identified fus and ews target genes with expression data showed that target genes are mostly transcribed, but that neither fus nor ews have in general major impact on basal transcriptional activity. this is in alignment with other studies pointing that, due to the discrepancy in the number of identified fus rna targets and the number of genes differentially expressed after alterations in the fus expression level, basal transcriptional regulation seems to not be the main function of fus  <cit> . numerous studies have identified rna targets for fus and ews and characterized their regulatory impact. rna interactions have been extensively analyzed, particular after the identification of fus mutations associated with als . a comparison of rna-clip identified rna targets for fus and ews  <cit>  and the genes hereby identified by chip-seq, showed that  <dig> out of  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig> genes for fus and ews, respectively, were overlapping . note that fus and ews target genes characterized in terms of expression in this report were also identified by rna-clip in hoell et al.  <cit> . while addressing the regulatory function of fus and ews in this study, we were unable to identify significant effects for c19orf <dig>  for the rcc <dig> gene, fus and ews seem to regulate the relative levels of rcc <dig> transcript isoforms. one possible mechanism could be that fus and ews binding in the snhg <dig> gene, which is intragenic to rcc <dig>  enhance the transcription initiated from the upstream rcc <dig> promoter. another possibility could be that binding of fus and ews is associated with rnapii pausing, which in turn could modulate the subsequent splicing pattern of rcc <dig> mrna. a similar mechanism is found regulating the alternative splicing of cd <dig> mrna mediated by the dna-binding protein ccctc-binding factor  <cit> . in addition, transcriptional pausing at terminal exons was described as a general phenomenon linking chromatin structure to rna metabolism  <cit> . for the hnrnpk gene, we observed a fus and ews function on alternative splice site selection at the last exon. in accordance, fus was also previously identified as a splicing regulator of hnrnpk  <cit> . we note that depletion of fus and ews results in up-regulation of the third fet-protein, taf <dig>  and this indirectly could also participate in the regulation . during the finalization of this manuscript it was described that position-specific binding of fus to nascent rna regulates mrna length through alternative poly-signal usage  <cit> . fus was shown to stall rnapii and prematurely terminate transcription when fus rna binding was downstream the poly-signal  <cit> . we note that this scenario could be in alignment with our observations of fus and ews binding downstream the poly-signal in conjugation with rnapii accumulation, and that fus and ews could be involved in the functional regulation of 3’ end processing related events of such target genes. it is clear that ews and fus regulate alternative rna processing of genes involved in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes  <cit> . fus also contributes to the biogenesis of a specific subset of mirnas, including species relevant for neuronal function, differentiation and synaptogenesis  <cit> . fus rna clip-tag distributions are similar in mouse and human neurons, indicating conserved functions for these genes, and target mrna go terms implicated fus in the regulation of vital genes for neuronal maintenance, development and function  <cit> . go analysis of fus and ews mrna targets revealed enrichment in biological processes of dna repair and spliceosome assembly  <cit> , and preferential binding of fus with pre-mrnas encoding rbps was associated with a regulatory function of fus in alternative splicing of rbp encoding genes in neurons  <cit> . thus, fus seems to participate in a cross-regulatory network with other rbps, further suggesting that perturbations of fus in als and ftld may result in both direct and indirect transcriptome changes through the effect of fus on other rbps  <cit> . our results are in line with the above mentioned studies, as go profiles of ews and fus target genes showed enrichment in signaling networks related to ribosomal functions, rna processing, and translation. this further highlight the putative functions of fus and ews in regulating genes encoding proteins associated with the rna regulome and that deregulation of particular components of this program may be an important factor in cancer and neurological diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented results show that fus and ews associate with a subset of transcribed genes, often downstream the poly-signal, and that the identified target genes are functionally enriched for encoding proteins with role in rna regulatory mechanisms. the presented results yield mechanistic insight into possible recruitment mechanisms of fus and ews to target genes for regulation of cellular pathways at the rna level, and have identified novel fus and ews target genes with potential to be mediators of disease-associated cellular functions.
