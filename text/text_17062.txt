BACKGROUND
within the embryonic limb, skeletal development is initiated by aggregation of mesenchymal cells. these early condensations can subsequently adopt either of two distinct fates. they can give rise to cartilage and then bone through a process known as an endochondral ossification  <cit>  or alternatively they can initiate a program leading to joint formation. in this latter process, a localized dense region known as an interzone is formed in the mesenchymal condensations, ultimately yielding a synovium, a capsule, ligaments and articular cartilage  <cit> . although the molecular mechanisms regulating endochondral ossification have been fairly well-investigated  <cit> , those controlling joint formation largely remain to be clarified. the subsequent mechanisms of joint maintenance are equally poorly understood.

osteoarthritis  is one of the most common diseases of the joint, which is characterized by cartilage destruction, synovial inflammation, and bone remodeling. since articular cartilage has very poor regenerative capability, once the joint surface becomes degraded, it cannot be recovered. oa is a multifactorial disease which is influenced by mechanical, environmental and genetic factors  <cit> .

gdf <dig> is one of the genes that has been implicated in joint maintenance. gdf <dig> is expressed in the early developing joint interzone  <cit> , and loss-of-function mutations in this gene cause abnormalities of a number of joints in mice  <cit> . however, misexpression of gdf <dig> does not induce ectopic joints, but rather causes an increase in chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, gdf <dig> has also been reported to be required for joint integrity and homeostasis in humans. a single nucleotide polymorphism in the human gdf <dig> promoter that reduces its transcriptional activity is associated with susceptibility to osteoarthritis  <cit> . moreover, human loss-of-function mutations in the gdf <dig> gene result in congenital skeletal disorders such as hunter-thompson and grebe chondrodysplasia  <cit> .

sox genes are involved in cell type specification in a variety of tissues, including sex determination, neurogenesis and skeletal formation  <cit> . of particular relevance, the chondrocyte lineage is established through the activity of sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig> <cit> . sox <dig> binds to a regulatory element of the cartilage-specific type ii collagen  gene  <cit> , and its mutation in humans is known to cause a skeletal malformation called campomelic dysplasia  <cit> . interestingly, the chondrogenic actions of sox genes are also required for synovial joint morphogenesis  <cit> , raising the possibility that sox genes might similarly play integral roles in joint maintenance.

based on analysis of their hmg domains, sox genes can be separated into subgroups a-j  <cit> . here, we examined the group-c sox gene sox <dig>  we find that sox <dig> is expressed in the cartilage condensations in early stages of skeletal development in mice, but at later stages sox <dig> expression is notably increased in the joint interzone. we show that sox <dig> can activate gdf <dig> expression and demonstrate that there is a direct binding site for sox <dig> in the 5’utr of the gdf <dig> gene in vitro. sox <dig> misexpression in chicks does not induce ectopic joint formation in vivo, but slightly enhances endogenous gdf <dig> expression. finally, we find that sox <dig> protein levels are decreased in degraded cartilage during osteoarthritic progression in humans and mice, indicating a possible role of sox <dig> in pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.

RESULTS
the sox <dig> expression in developing limbs
to identify candidate genes that might play a role in regulating gdf <dig> expression in developing joints, we conducted a preliminary screen of all the known sox transcription factors. we examined the transcriptional activities of a reporter dependent upon the human gdf <dig> promoter  following overexpression of each of the known human sox genes in hela and atdc <dig> cells . the genes that gave the most prominent results in this assay were the three group-c sox genes  and of these, sox <dig> produced the strongest enhancement in both cell lines. the increased luciferase activitities induced by co-transfection of sox <dig> and the reporter construct containing the gdf <dig> promoter were about  <dig> and  <dig>  times higher  than that of sox <dig> and the control reporter vector lacking the gdf <dig> promoter but containing the luciferase reporter . we noted that sox <dig> activated transcription in the absence of the gdf <dig> promoter, albeit to a lesser degree, presumably due to non-specific interactions with the backbone of the reporter plasmid. this effect, which was not specific to sox <dig>  might be caused by the more stable α-helical structure of its transactivation domain than other sox genes  <cit> . nonetheless, sox <dig> had a clear and significant effect on the gdf <dig> promoter above that seen with the vector alone. on the other hand, the overexpression of sox <dig> and  <dig>  which are known to be involved in cartilage differentiation in developing limb, had less effect on the activity of the gdf <dig> promoter than that of sox <dig>  based on this preliminary screen, we chose sox <dig> for further study.

we first compared the expression pattern of sox <dig> and gdf <dig> by double fluorescence section in situ hybridization during an embryonic limb development of mice. at embryonic stage  <dig>  , when joint interzones are just starting to form between the metatarsals and tarsal elements, sox <dig> is expressed in the cartilage condensations, showing a distinct expression pattern from the joint-specific gdf <dig> . however, at e <dig> , the level of sox <dig> transcription is specifically increased at the interzone in the prospective joint region and co-localized with gdf <dig> .

increase of endogenous gdf <dig> expression by sox <dig> overexpression
to examine the capacity of sox <dig> to regulate cellular gdf <dig> expression, we created variants of the murine chondrogenic atdc <dig> and fibroblastic c3h10t1/ <dig> cell lines in which we stably introduced human sox <dig> through retroviral infection. the resultant sox <dig> overexpression increased endogenous mrna levels of gdf <dig> in both cell lines . conversely, the gdf <dig> mrna level was suppressed  by the retrovirally mediated shrna knock-down of endogenous sox <dig> activity  in atdc <dig> cells .

sox <dig> has three conserved domains: an n-terminus sry-related hmg domain , an acid-rich domain  and a c-terminus domain  , which contains potential transcriptional regulatory regions  <cit> . to determine the domains that are required for gdf <dig> expression, we created constructs lacking each domain, called sox11Δn , sox11Δar  and sox11Δc , respectively, and examined their ability to transcriptionally regulate the gdf <dig> promoter. the lack of the n-terminus hmg domain or c-terminus domain abrogated the transcriptional response induced by full-length sox <dig> overexpression . moreover, the endogenous gdf <dig> mrna level was significantly suppressed by constructs carrying deletions in either of these domains in atdc <dig> cells by retroviral infection . in contrast, the construct lacking the acid-rich domain did not abrogate gdf <dig> expression , indicating that the n-terminus and c-terminus domains, but not the acid-rich domain, play important roles in mediating sox <dig> function with respect to gdf <dig> expression.

identification of a core sox11-responsive element in the gdf <dig> promoter
we found five clustered sequences similar to the putative sox family consensus binding site caag in this region , that were highly conserved between humans and mice  <cit> . one of them was one-base different from the published consensus binding site , and the others were two-bases different  . we created four reporter constructs deleting these motifs: deletion of first two binding sites , first three binding sites , first four binding sites , or all five binding sites ; and compared their transcriptional activities in a dual-luciferase assay. we observed a stepdown in the luciferase activity induced when a deletion is introduced between + <dig> bp and + <dig> bp, which contains two adjacent sox family binding motifs. these were thus candidates for sox <dig> binding sites in the gdf <dig> promoter. a  <dig> bp element , containing the identified putative binding sites, was defined as segment a .

to further determine the core responsive sequence in segment a, we created mutations in the identified motifs . transactivation by sox <dig> was decreased only by mutations  <dig>  and  <dig>  not by mutations  <dig>  or  <dig>  and the inhibitory effect among mutations  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were comparable, indicating that the thymine at the + <dig> bp nucleotide is crucial for the binding between gdf <dig> promoter and sox <dig> .

previous reports suggest that a single nucleotide polymorphism  rs <dig>  in the 5’utr region is related to gdf <dig> expression and its postnatal joint maintenance  <cit> . we found a putative sox family binding motif at  just downstream of the snp. we examined the potential ability of sox <dig> to activate gene transcription through this motif in a luciferase assay. deletion of the sox motif near the snp did decrease transcriptional activity induced by sox <dig> overexpression. however, the one nucleotide mutation at the + <dig> bp  suppressed it more extensively, indicating the binding motif at + <dig> has a stronger affinity for the gdf <dig> promoter .

we further examined the binding of sox <dig> to segment a in electromobility shift  and chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays. in emsa, an oligonucleotide probe detected a complex formation between a segment a and in-vitro translated sox <dig> protein, which was supershifted by an antibody to sox <dig>  indicating the direct binding of sox <dig> to the segment a . moreover, cold competition with an excess amount of the unlabeled wild-type probe reduced the complex formation. specificity of sox <dig> antibody was confirmed by the absence of a supershift band with a non-immune normal igg . a chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay was performed using hela cells transfected with sox <dig> linked to three tandem repeats of the ha tag. pull down with an antibody to the ha tag showed in vivo binding of sox <dig> to the gdf <dig> regulatory region including segment a . specificity was confirmed, as sox <dig> was not immunoprecipitated by the overexpression of the empty vector or by a control non-immune igg antibody.

involvement of sox <dig> in cartilage formation in vitro
gdf <dig> is known to have chondrogenic ability in vitro and in vivo <cit> . therefore, we next examined the potential ability of sox <dig> to stimulate chondrogenic differentiation in vitro. the endogenous mrna levels of chondrogenic marker genes, col2a <dig>  sox <dig> and tenascinc <cit>  were all increased by the retroviral introduction of human sox <dig> into atdc <dig> cells . moreover, a short hairpin rna  directed against the endogenous mouse sox <dig> decreased the expression of the three chondrogenic marker genes . a similar chondrogenic effect of sox <dig> was observed in micromass cell cultures of chick limb bud cells after infection of an rcas virus encoding human sox <dig>  as indicated by an increase in alcian blue staining . the endogenous gdf <dig> mrna level was concomitantly increased in the micromass cultures by the infection of rcas virus encoding sox <dig> .

misexpression of sox <dig> in chicks enhances gdf <dig> expressions in vivo
to know the effect of sox <dig> overexpression in vivo, we injected rcas virus encoding gfp fused to the chick sox <dig> cdna into right chick lateral plate mesoderm at hh stage  <dig> , and harvested the limb at hh stage  <dig> or  <dig> . after confirming gfp fluorescence , we performed whole mount in situ hybridization on the injected limbs with a riboprobe for chick gdf <dig>  we used the non-infected contralateral side of the same embryo as a control. misexpression of sox <dig> did not induce additional domains of gdf <dig> expression, indicating sox <dig> is not sufficient to drive its expression in ectopic locations . however, when we harvested the hind limbs and examined the expression level of gdf <dig>  we saw a slight but significant enhancement following sox <dig> overexpression . the increased expression of gdf <dig> protein was also confirmed by western blotting . these results suggest that sox <dig> can at least partially contribute to the regulation of gdf <dig> expression but it is more than likely that there are other molecules involved in its expression during embryonic development.

decrease of sox <dig> expression during cartilage degradation
to know the role of sox <dig> in cartilage homeostasis, we next created an experimental osteoarthritis  model through surgical induction of instability in the knee joints of 8-week-old mice  <cit> . sox <dig> is normally expressed at a high level in the weight-bearing regions of the mature joint, although it is less expressed in the peripheral weight bearing zone or non-weight bearing zone such as edge of femoral condyle, tibial plateau or intercondylar space . four weeks after surgery, the medial knee joints exhibited cartilage degradation, as demonstrated by a decrease in safranin-o staining . immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both sox <dig> and gdf <dig> expression levels were decreased in the degraded cartilage in the medial knee joint, whereas they were still strongly expressed in the intact cartilage from the sham-operated knees or from the lateral knee joint of oa-operated knees  . these results were consistent among multiple sections obtained from the center of the weight-bearing area in different mouse knee joints  .

finally we analyzed  <dig> samples of human knee joints that had undergone total knee arthroplasty. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that sox <dig> expression was decreased from early stages of osteoarthritis progression, as assessed by decreased safranin-o staining and modified mankin’s cartilage degradation scores  . specificity of sox <dig> antibody was confirmed by using the antibody of non-immune igg .

discussion
in the present study, we identify sox <dig> as a molecule contributing to the regulation of gdf <dig> expression during joint formation and maintenance. in previous studies, sox <dig> was identified as an essential molecule for neuronal maturation, however its molecular function in developing limbs had not been explored  <cit> . we found that sox <dig> is expressed in the skeletal elements of the developing limbs and that its expression is increased in joint tissue as it develops . sox <dig> deficient mice show a range of skeletal morphological abnormalities  <cit> . however, no defects were observed in the program of joint formation per se, and the resulting limb phenotype is not severe  <cit> . it is more than likely that many genes are involved in joint formation and their function may be redundant.

we show that sox <dig> can enhance gdf <dig> expression in vitro . sox proteins are known to bind the 5’ utr of target genes to modulate their transcriptional activities.  <cit>  we find that, indeed, sox <dig> can bind the 5’utr of the gdf <dig> gene. although sox <dig> enhanced chondrogenic proliferation in vitro, its misexpression in vivo did not affect the gross morphology of limb nor the mrna expression patterns of gdf <dig> . however, sox <dig> overexpression increased the mrna levels of gdf <dig> both in micromass cell culture from chick limb bud cells and in misexpression experiments in vivo, albeit to a small extent . while sox <dig> is not requisite for joint formation, our results suggest that sox <dig> is likely to at least partially contribute to the regulation of gdf <dig> expression during that process.

finally, to investigate the roles of sox <dig> in joint homeostasis, we examined its expression pattern in an osteoarthritis experimental model of knee joints in adult mice and human samples after total knee replacement surgery . a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gdf <dig> gene has been reported to be related to susceptibility to osteoarthritis  <cit> . although the sox <dig> binding site in our study seems to be independent of this reported snp, reverse phase protein arrays in osteoarthritic and normal cartilage tissue identified sox <dig> as one of the molecules down-regulated in osteoarthritic cartilage  <cit> . consistent with these results, sox <dig> expression was decreased in degraded cartilage both in mouse experimental osteoarthritis model and in human samples of osteoarthritis. these data support the speculation that sox <dig> could be important not only for embryonic joint formation, but also for joint homeostasis in articular cartilage in adults. this could be tested by assessing whether sox <dig> deficient mice have increased incidence of developing oa relative to their wild type littermates.

joint formation is a complex and multistep process. another molecule essential for joint formation is wnt9a <cit> . wnt signaling inhibits chondrogenesis and promotes joint formation  <cit> . several joints are abnormally formed in the wnt9a-deficient mice  <cit> . the process of joint formation likely includes local induction of β-catenin/wnt9a activity, which serves to block chondrogenesis and to subsequently maintain the interzone space. in parallel, signals secreted from the interzone, potentially including gdf <dig>  act on neighboring cartilage elements to prevent induction of a new interzone in the vicinity. cells taken from prospective autopod joint sites using a microsurgical procedure displayed a propensity to undergo chondrogenesis following treatment with exogenous recombinant gdf <dig> <cit> , indicating that the formation of the mature articular cartilage is induced by the stimulation of chondrogenesis by secreted proteins such as gdf <dig>  we suggest that sox <dig> could be one of the molecules involved in the later stages of joint development, contributing to the maturation of articular cartilage, at least in part through enhancing gdf <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have identified sox <dig> as being capable of directly regulating gdf <dig> in vitro and showed its partial contribution to the in vivo regulation of gdf <dig> expression during joint formation and homeostasis. the further identification of molecules acting upstream of gdf <dig> will not only provide further understanding of joint formation, but will also potentially lead to insight into the pathogenesis of human joint diseases such as osteoarthritis.
