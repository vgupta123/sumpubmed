BACKGROUND
enterococci are normal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal  tract, but have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens with high-level resistance to antibiotics, such as ampicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin  <cit> . they can cause a wide spectrum of diseases, including bacteremia, peritonitis, surgical wound infections, urinary tract infections, endocarditis, and a variety of device-related infections  <cit> . the majority of the enterococcal infections are caused by enterococcus faecalis. however, in parallel with the increase in nosocomial enterococcal infections, a partial replacement of e. faecalis by enterococcus faecium has occurred in european and united states hospitals  <cit> http://www.earss.rivm.nl.

molecular epidemiological studies indicated that e. faecium isolates responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections and hospital outbreaks are genetically distinct from indigenous intestinal isolates  <cit> . recent studies revealed intestinal colonization rates with these hospital-acquired e. faecium as high as 40% in hospital wards, while colonization in healthy people appeared to be almost absent  <cit> . it is assumed that adherence to mucosal surfaces is a key process for bacteria to survive and colonize the gi tract. intestinal colonization of nosocomial e. faecium strains is a first and key step that precedes clinical infection due to fecal contamination of catheters or wounds, and in the minority of infections, through bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to extraintestinal sites  <cit> . it is not known which factors facilitate intestinal colonization of nosocomial e. faecium strains. the enterococcal surface protein esp, located on a putative pathogenicity island  <cit> , is specifically enriched in hospital-acquired e. faecium and has been identified as a potential virulence gene. esp is involved in biofilm formation  <cit>  and its expression is affected by changes in environmental conditions, being highest in conditions that mimic the microenvironment of the human large intestines: 37°c and anaerobioses  <cit> . furthermore, in one study, bloodstream isolates of e. faecium enriched with esp had increased adherence to human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells   <cit> , suggesting a role of esp in intestinal colonization. in contrast, adherence of e. faecium to caco- <dig> cell lines was not associated with the presence of esp in another study  <cit> . in e. faecalis, esp is also located on a pathogenicity island, although the genetic content and organization of the e. faecium and e. faecalis pai is different. esp of e. faecalis is also expressed on the surface of the bacterium  <cit>  and is important in colonization of urinary tract epithelial cells  <cit> . by using a mouse model, pultz et al.  <cit>  showed that esp does not facilitate intestinal colonization or translocation of e. faecalis in mice, however this does not automatically predict a lack function for e. faecium esp in murine colonization. first data suggest that the function of esp in both enterococcal species might be different. esp of e. faecium is clearly involved in biofilm formation  while there is controversy about the role of e. faecalis esp in biofilm formation  <cit> . furthermore, studies so far indicate that e. faecalis harbors more virulence determinants then e. faecium. for instance, besides esp different determinants  are putatively involved in biofilm formation  <cit> . this suggests that virulence factors in e. faecalis play somewhat redundant or partially overlapping roles such that the absence of a single virulence factor, like esp, has only minimal effect. to elucidate the role of esp of e. faecium in bacterial adhesion and intestinal colonization, we studied an esp mutant, constructed and described recently  <cit> , and its esp expressing parent strain for their ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal colonization by using caco- <dig> cells and a mouse model.

RESULTS
adherence assay to caco- <dig> cells
to determine whether esp contributes to adherence of intestinal epithelial cells, the esp expressing e. faecium strain e <dig>  its isogenic esp-deficient mutant , and an e. faecium esp-negative strain  were investigated for their ability to adhere to differentiated  <dig> days old caco- <dig> cells. strain e <dig> exhibited high adherence to caco- <dig> cells, while the esp-negative strain, e <dig>  showed only low-level binding to caco- <dig> cells . this difference in adherence was significant . however, no significant difference in adherence to caco- <dig> cells was observed between e <dig> and e1162Δesp.

intestinal colonization
to investigate the role of esp in intestinal colonization and translocation to mln, the esp expressing e <dig> and its isogenic esp-deficient mutant  were inoculated orally in mice separately or simultaneously in a mixed inoculum. mice were kept under ceftriaxone treatment the entire experiment. prior to any intervention no e. faecium was cultured from stools of mice. the mean enterococcal contents of the stool of naïve mice was  <dig> ×  <dig> ±  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/gram, these colonies were specified being e. faecalis.

both e <dig> and e1162Δesp were able to colonize the intestinal tract with comparable high numbers of cells for the entire  <dig> days of the experiment. one day after inoculation e <dig> reached a median of  <dig>   ×  <dig> cfu/gram of stool and e1162Δesp of  <dig>   ×  <dig> cfu/gram. ten days after inoculation, the amount of both strains slightly reduced to  <dig>   ×  <dig> and  <dig>   ×  <dig> cfu/gram of stool, respectively . similar amounts of e <dig> and e1162Δesp were found in the stool of mice colonized when the mixed inoculum was administered . after  <dig> days of colonization, all mice were sacrificed and e. faecium colonies obtained from small bowel, cecum, and colon contents were calculated. in both cecum and colon comparable amounts of e <dig>  ×  <dig> and colon contents  <dig>   ×  <dig> cfu/gram) and e1162Δesp  ×  <dig> and colon contents  <dig>   ×  <dig> cfu/gram) were isolated, from both separate  and mixed inocula . significantly more e1162Δesp  ×  <dig> cfu/gram) compared to e <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/gram) was isolated from the small bowel contents of mice when inoculated separately with e <dig> wild type and the esp-mutant strain . this difference was not found in mice inoculated with the mixture of e <dig> and e1162Δesp .

both e <dig> and e1162Δesp were able to translocate to the mln. from both of the separately inoculated groups of mice, three out of seven mln were found positive for either e <dig> or e1162Δesp. no bacteria were cultured from blood. no pathological changes in the intestinal wall were observed in any of the colonized mice.

for both mono infection and mixed infection, randomly picked colonies were tested by mlva to confirm strain identity. all colonies had the same mlva profile belonging to e. faecium e <dig> 

discussion
nosocomial e. faecium infections are primarily caused by specific hospital-selected clonal lineages, which are genetically distinct from the indigenous enterococcal flora. high rates of colonization of the gi tract of patients by these hospital-selected lineages upon hospitalization have been documented  <cit> . once established in the gi tract these nosocomial strains can cause infections through bacterial translocation from the gi tract to extraintestinal sites  <cit> . the mechanism which promotes supplementation of the commensal enterococcal population by these nosocomial strains is not known. destabilization of the gi tract through antibiotic therapy may provide nosocomial strains enhanced opportunities to gain a foothold in the gi tract. however, the effect of antibiotics is probably not the sole explanation for the emergence of nosocomial e. faecium infections since many antibiotics used in hospitals have relatively little enterococcal activity. this implicates that nosocomial e. faecium strains may possess traits that facilitate colonization of portions of the gi tract that the indigenous flora cannot effectively monopolize. cell surface proteins like esp, implicated in biofilm formation and specifically enriched in nosocomial strains, could represent one of these traits. previously, it was shown that e. faecium is able to adhere to human and mouse intestinal mucus in vitro and becomes associated in vivo with the intestinal mucus layer of clindamycin treated mice  <cit> . this suggests an interaction between the bacterium and the mucus or with the epithelium itself. to examine the role of esp in intestinal adherence and colonization, an esp expressing strain of e. faecium  and its isogenic esp-deficient mutant  were studied for adherence to differentiated caco- <dig> cells and colonization of murine intestines. e <dig>  a hospital-acquired strain, exhibited significantly higher adherence to caco- <dig> cells than e <dig>  a representative of the indigenous flora. these results are consistent with an earlier study performed by lund et al.  <cit> . however, no difference in adherence to caco- <dig> cells between the e <dig> and the e1162Δesp was found, indicating that esp is not the determining factor responsible for the observed difference in caco- <dig> cell adherence between nosocomial and indigenous e. faecium strains. this also implies that other determinants present in hospital-acquired e. faecium strains contribute to adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells. comparative genomic hybridizations of  <dig> e. faecium nosocomial, commensal and animal isolates identified more than  <dig> genes that were enriched in nosocomial strains, including genes encoding putative adhesins, antibiotic resistance, is elements, phage sequences, and novel metabolic pathways  <cit> .

in addition, similar levels of intestinal colonization or translocation were found after inoculation with e <dig> wild type or the isogenic esp mutant e1162Δesp. these data are in accordance with a study performed by pultz et al.  <cit>  in which they showed that esp did not facilitate intestinal colonization or translocation of e. faecalis in clindamycin-treated mice. only from the small bowel contents of mice when inoculated separately with e <dig> wild type and the esp-mutant strain significantly more e1162Δesp compared to e <dig> was isolated. this was an unexpected observation and we have no explanation for the fact that the levels of e1162Δesp in the small bowel are as high as in the cecum. relatively lower levels as seen for e <dig> are more typical for the small bowel.

CONCLUSIONS
our data clearly demonstrate that esp is not essential for high density colonization of the gi tract by nosocomial strains. other possible candidate traits implicated in this process could include novel adhesins, like the novel cell surface proteins recently identified  <cit> , bacteriocins, factors that resist specific or non-specific host defence mechanisms, and/or the ability to utilize new growth substrates. it is interesting in this respect that we recently identified a novel genomic island highly specific for nosocomial strains that tentatively encodes novel sugar uptake system  <cit> .

for nosocomial e. faecium clones the gi tract serves as staging area from which they can disperse in and between patients, ultimately causing hospital-wide outbreaks. it is therefore of utmost importance to gain insight into the processes and determinants that promote intestinal colonization of nosocomial e. faecium strains. only then we will be able to impede subsequent spread of these nosocomial clones.
