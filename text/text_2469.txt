BACKGROUND
polyploidy represents the occurrence of more than two complete sets of chromosomes in an organism and has long been recognized as playing an especially important role in plant evolution  <cit> . in flowering plants, polyploidy extent has been largely underestimated in terms of its commonality. indeed, major recent advances in genomic analysis has revealed that almost all angiosperms have experienced at least one round of whole genome duplication during their evolution.

the wide spreading of polyploidy throughout the angiosperms can be related to their highly plastic genome structure, as inferred from their tolerance to changes in chromosome number, genome size and epigenome  <cit> . although information with regard to the modes of polyploidization is limited, the major route of polyploidization seems to be sexual through the functioning of gametes with somatic chromosome number   <cit> . indeed, sexual polyploidization as compared to asexual would explain better the success of polyploid species in terms of higher fitness and more genetic flexibility. the control of 2n gamete formation has been generally attributed to the action of single recessive genes. these genes exhibit incomplete penetrance and variable expression that is significantly influenced by genetic, environmental and developmental factors  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms leading to 2n gametes have only recently begun to be uncovered  <cit> . in particular, d'erfurth and colleagues  <cit>  isolated and characterized parallel spindle <dig> gene in arabidopsis thaliana  that controls diploid pollen formation through spindle orientation in the second division of meiosis. the occurrence of parallel spindles at meiosis ii is a frequently found mechanism for 2n pollen formation that was described in potato many decades ago  <cit> . in potato, ps mutants have been used for breeding purposes in order to introgress beneficial traits from diploid  relatives into cultivated strains  <cit> . however, the gene ps leading to 2n pollen via parallel spindles was not isolated, so far.

interestingly, atps <dig> is a protein which contains contemporarily a forkhead associated domain , and a c-terminal pilt n-terminus domain . so far, the fha domain has been found in more than  <dig> different proteins from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes involved in several processes including cell cycle control, dna repair, protein degradation, transcription and pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . fha domain was shown to recognize phosphothreonine-containing epitopes  <cit> . pinc domain has been found in more than  <dig> proteins in all life kingdoms. pinc domain has rna nuclease activity  <cit> . in eukaryotes, pinc-containing proteins, such as human smg <dig> and smg <dig>  were linked to nonsense-mediated mrna decay , that recognizes and rapidly degrades mrnas containing premature translation termination codons .

in this study, a sequence-homology-based strategy was carried out to isolate ps gene from a diploid potato. through this approach, a genomic locus ps-like  and seven cdnas affected by alternative splicing have been cloned. the occurrence of at least two other psl loci is suggested in potato. in order to shed light on the evolution and function of psl genes in plants, a phylogenetic analysis of psl genes was performed and fha/pinc domains were compared. as far as we know, this is the first report about the isolation and characterization of psl in a crop. we also demonstrate the conservation of this gene family throughout plants.

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of psl genes in potato
using the predicted protein sequence of atps <dig>  two ests were identified on dfci potato gene index  named tc <dig> and dn <dig> corresponding to fha and pinc domains, respectively. the primers designed on the above mentioned ests allowed to isolate in diploid potato a  <dig> kbp genomic clone  lacking utr regions. in order to complete genomic sequence of psl <dig>  by querying potato genome sequencing consortium database  and sol genomic network  we retrieved a  <dig> kbp region of s. phureja v <dig> scaffold pgsc0003dms <dig>  and a tomato bac clone ac <dig>   sharing 97% and 93% of sequence identity with psl <dig>  respectively. primers designed on the tomato sequence were used to isolate a potato  <dig>  kbp psl <dig> genomic region spanning  <dig> kbp upstream of the start codon to about  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon . in silico gene prediction showed a structure of psl <dig> composed by six exons and five introns  and a  <dig>  kbp hypothetical psl <dig> cdna  with a gc content of 42% encoding a  <dig>  kda protein of  <dig> aminoacids .

given the meiotic function of atps <dig>  potato psl <dig> cdna was isolated from pre-bolting buds. seven different cdnas ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kbp were isolated including psl1a of  <dig>  kbp corresponding to psl1_pred. the sequence alignment between cdnas and the genomic psl <dig> indicated the presence of different groups of related psl sequences encoded by more than one locus . in order to investigate the relationship between the different psl cdnas, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis that suggested the existence of three different loci named psl <dig>  psl <dig> and psl <dig> . on the basis of sequence similarity, we assigned psl1a, psl1b and psl1c cdnas  to genomic psl <dig>  psl3a, psl3b and psl3c cdnas  to psl <dig> and the last cdna to psl <dig> . moreover, the distance measured as the number of different nucleotides among the seven cdnas showed that psl <dig> was more similar to psl <dig> than to psl <dig> . the nucleotide comparison between the predicted phupsl cdna and psl1a, psl <dig> and psl3c cdnas showing a similarity of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, suggested that phupsl locus corresponds to psl <dig> being the differences explained by the different genetic background.

based on the sequences of cloned psl cdnas, psl1b and psl1c, psl3a and psl3b are alternative splicing forms of psl <dig> and psl <dig> since they retained complete or partial introns causing the formation of premature stop codons  . moreover, the cloned psl <dig> cdna showed a ptc caused by the retention of the second intron. as a consequence, all the predicted psl proteins, except ppsl1a and ppsl3c, had truncated or lacking pinc domain .

in order to evaluate whether the alternative splicing psl variants were possible target of degradation through nmd we calculated the distance between ptcs and the successive exon-exon junction. being this distance more than 50- <dig> nt according to nagi and maquat  <cit>  we could consider psl1b, psl1c, psl <dig>  psl3a and psl3b as target of nmd.

phylogenetic analysis of psl genes in sequenced viridaeplantae
in order to investigate the evolution of psl family, a phylogenetic analysis was performed by a search on interpro  for proteins with both fha and pinc domains. interestingly, these domains were contemporary present only in plants, except for the multidrug-efflux transporter naegrdraft_ <dig> from the amoeboid naegleria gruberi.

psl1a sequence was blasted against the phytozome v <dig> database  that contains the genomic sequences of  <dig> organisms and against the sol genomics network containing the tomato genome assembly. afterwards,  <dig> sequences of predicted psl proteins were collected from  <dig> different organisms , since physcomitrella patens, ricinus communis, volvox carteri, zea mays and chlamydomonas rehinardtii seemingly lack psl genes. the sequences were then aligned and the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree is shown in figure  <dig>  the distribution of psls is in agreement with the known phylogenetic relationships between species among dicots and monocots. moreover, one psl locus was found in the analyzed plant species, except for glycine max. indeed, four different psl loci were identified in soybean and three of them encode alternative transcripts. differently from potato, the alternative transcripts of soybean retain pinc domain being the splicing sites located at the 3'-end of mrna .

analysis of fha and pinc secondary structure and active sites in psl proteins
in order to assess the conservation degree of psls, we predicted and compared the secondary structure of fha and pinc domains using the smart  and psipred  tools. it is reported that fha domain is 80- <dig> aminoacid  long folded into a 11-stranded beta sandwich, which sometimes contains small helical insertions between the loops connecting the strands. however, in silico analysis of fha displays only  <dig> beta-strands  out of  <dig> including the residues involved in phosphopeptide recognition and stabilisation of domain architecture  <cit> . using the above mentioned tools on yeast rad53p , a well characterized fha containing protein  <cit> , the identified fha region was  <dig> aa covering  <dig> beta-strands . as shown in figure  <dig>  the length of the predicted fha region in our dataset was  <dig> aa except for brassica rapa  and for glycine max psl <dig> . while the majority of fha domains showed  <dig> beta-strands, brassica rapa fha was predicted to be composed of  <dig> consecutive beta-strands followed by an alpha helical region. the group of monocots, brachypodium distachyon, oryza sativa and sorghum bicolor, as well as dicot glycine max  showed a helical insertion between the 2nd and the 3rd beta-strand. in other species this helical insertion was predicted but at a low confidence value as estimated by psipred. afterward, we compared the active sites in yrad53p with those present in pslfha domains through the protein alignment showed in figure  <dig>  it can be observed that glycine- <dig>  arginine- <dig>  serine- <dig> and histidine- <dig> in fha domain are perfectly conserved. the arginine- <dig> seems to be absent in all plant sequences. in the analyzed species, asparagine- <dig> showed a substitution with histidine, characterized by a different polarity, except for soybean psl <dig> glutamine- <dig> and brassica rapa that seems to lack this site. asparagine- <dig> is mostly substituted with the similar polar serine. instead, alpsl <dig>  atpsl <dig>  gmpsl <dig> and gmpsl <dig> exhibited arginine- <dig> with different polarity while brpsl <dig> glutammine- <dig> and mtpsl <dig> cysteine- <dig> both showing similar polarity of asparagine.

the analysis of pinc domain in our dataset started with the prediction of its secondary structure in human smg <dig>  . it is reported that hsmg6pinc  is  <dig> aa folded into a 5-stranded parallel beta-sheets that is highly twisted and alpha-helices arranged on both sides of each beta-sheet for a total of  <dig>  three aspartate residues are essential for pinc activity in hsmg <dig>  while a threonine or a serine in the sequence xd might be involved in catalytic role on the basis of similarity with other pinc domains  <cit> . smart predicted a pinc domain of  <dig> aa lacking the first and the last alpha-helices while psipred predicted  <dig> beta-sheets and  <dig> alpha helices in hsmg <dig> . in our dataset the pinc domain ranged from a minimum of  <dig> aa in cucumis sativus to a maximum of  <dig> aa in brachypodium distachyon . in our prediction, the number of beta-sheets ranged from  <dig> in gmpsl <dig> and cspsl <dig> to  <dig> in cppsl <dig>  the number of predicted alpha-helices ranged from  <dig> in cspsl <dig>  ospsl <dig> and psl3c to  <dig> in bdpsl <dig> and cppsl <dig>  afterward, we compared the active residues of pinc in psl proteins. the alignment between pinc domain of psl proteins and hsmg <dig> is shown in figure  <dig> . brpsl <dig>  smpsl <dig> and psl3c show the three expected aspartate residues at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the alignment. sipsl <dig> and sbpsl <dig> have a substitution of two aspartate residues with asparagine- <dig>  glutammate- <dig>  when a substitution occurs, the aspartate- <dig> is mostly replaced with glutammate- <dig> except for cppsl <dig> showing a different polarity residue  and mgpsl <dig> showing an alyphatic residue . the aspartate- <dig> is widely conserved except in bdpsl <dig>  ospsl <dig> and sipsl <dig> where it is substituted with a serine- <dig>  most of the psl proteins show a catalytic serine- <dig> in the described pattern sxd  instead of threonine- <dig> in hsmg <dig>  ptpsl <dig>  sipsl <dig>  smpsl <dig> and vvpsl <dig>  gmpsl <dig> and sbpsl <dig> are the only proteins lacking the c-terminal extremity of pinc interrupting at leucine- <dig> and lysine- <dig> respectively thus missing the catalytic threonine/serine- <dig> and the aspartate- <dig> 

selective pressure among amino acid sites in the psl family
in order to test for presence of positive selection at individual amino acid codons, the site specific models implemented in datamonkey  <dig> webserver   <cit>  were used. the integrative selection analysis of fel, slac and fer alghoritms evidenced no significant positive selected sites . conversely,  <dig> significant negative selected sites  were identified. the region between fha to pinc domains included few negative selected sites which were mostly located near the functional domains. the codons encoding the highly conserved active sites glycine- <dig>  arginine- <dig>  serine- <dig> and histidine- <dig> in fha and aspartate- <dig>  serine/threonine- <dig> and aspartate- <dig> in pinc were also subjected to negative selection . these observations support the results obtained through sequence alignment and evidence an occurrence of negative pressure upon non-synonymous mutations in psl genes. in particular, the regions next to the functional domains and the codons for active sites were affected.

discussion
in this work, we isolated psl genes in a diploid potato  and through in silico analysis we identified psl in other plant species. the function of psl in plants can be inferred from arabidopsis study on atps <dig> gene that appears responsible for the spindle orientation at meiosis ii playing a regulatory function, likely via rna decay  <cit> .

in all the analysed species, except soybean and potato, psl loci appear as singleton behaving as resistant to duplication. it is known that angiosperms are mostly paleopolyploids  <cit> , many having survived multiple duplication events  <cit> . analysis of genome sequences shows that some genes duplicate and persist as multiple copies after whole genome duplication  while other genes are iteratively returned to singleton status. moreover, it seems that the singleton status is consistently restored for some functional gene groups like those involved in dna repair or signal transduction  <cit> . the evolutive history of potato and soybean could explain the expansion of psl genes occurring in these species that have experienced recent wgd. in cultivated potato , wgd is reported to have occurred about  <dig> million of years ago  after the divergence from solanum lycopersicum  <cit> . in soybean , which seems to be an ancient allopolyploid on the basis of two different centromeric repeat classes  <cit> , two rounds of wgd happened the latter aging 10- <dig> mya  <cit> . in addition, the location of the four soybean psls on different chromosomes reinforce their origin from wgd rather than tandem duplications.

the evident feature of psl proteins is the contemporary presence of fha and pinc domains. fha is reported as a phosphothreonine  binding domain showing a  <dig> beta-sandwich secondary structure, also containing small helical insertions between the beta-strands  <cit> . the fha active sites are usually located in the loops connecting b3/b <dig>  b4/b <dig> and b6/b <dig> strands. rad53pfha arginine- <dig>  serine- <dig> and asparagine- <dig>  are involved in the interaction with the phosphopeptide backbone. arginine- <dig>  is the most important aminoacid for fha binding specificity. indeed, its conversion to glycine shifts the binding from ptxxd to ptxxi peptides in rad53pfha interaction experiments using surface plasmon resonance  <cit> . glycine- <dig> and histidine- <dig>  stabilize the architecture of the binding site. the remaining conserved residue, asparagine- <dig> , is remote from the peptide binding site and serves to tether the beta turn between b7/ <dig> to b <dig>  <cit> . the comparison of predicted secondary structure in our dataset showed a wide conservation among plant species regarding the number and the position of the beta-sheets and the presence of an helical insertion between the second and the third beta-sheet as a characteristic feature of monocot psl proteins. the comparison of active sites showed that two pslfha residues involved in pt binding as well those involved in stabilisation of the architecture of the binding site are fully conserved except for asparagine- <dig> that is replaced with a different polarity residue  in alpsl <dig>  atps <dig>  gmpsl <dig> and gmpsl <dig> with unknown possible effect on domain architecture. moreover, as compared to rad53pfha, a conserved substitution in plants is a histidine instead of asparagine- <dig>  known to be important for the selectivity of binding of phosphothreonine upon phosphoserine. the different polarity between these two residues might suggest a functional diversification of this active site. however, the consequences of this substitution in pslfha domain in terms of ligand binding cannot be easily predicted and should be assessed by protein:protein interaction analysis. it is also intriguing the lack of arginine- <dig> in plants raising the question of binding selectivity for plant pslfha.

as regards pinc domain, we made reference to human smg6pinc which has rnase activity and it is composed of alternating beta-sheets and alpha-helices. it is reported that hsmg <dig> is involved in nmd together with hsmg <dig> and hsmg <dig>  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atsmg <dig> was proved to be involved in nmd and to be required for meiotic spindle organization in meiosis ii  <cit> . as reported by glavan and colleagues  <cit> , hsmg <dig> and other pinc domains show three conserved aspartic residues at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  involved in mg2+ binding. threonine or serine embedded in the motif  xd is proposed to be the catalytic site on the basis of sequence alignment of pin domains and it is located at residue- <dig>  in hsmg6pinc.

our results showed differences of secondary structures in pslpinc domains even between phylogenetically close organisms. moreover, the typical alternation between beta-sheets and alpha-helices does not seem to be respected. in spite of these differences, the active sites showed a wide conservation among plants. the aspartate- <dig> is conserved in all proteins except for sbpsl <dig> and sipsl <dig> where an asparagine is present. this substitution maybe occurred after the divergence of bep from paccad clades among poaceae given its absence in oryza sativa, brachypodium distachyon and selaginella moellendorffii. the residue- <dig> showed the major degree of variation among the species mostly characterized by glutamate instead of aspartate. this substitution is not related to phylogenesis, being glutamate present in both monocots and dicots while aspartate- <dig> is shared by the brassicaceae brpsl <dig>  the selaginellaceae smpsl <dig> and the solanaceae psl3c. in carica papaya, mimulus guttatus and medicago truncatula the change involved aminoacids with a different polarity such as lysine, alanine, and asparagine. the aspartate- <dig> is widely conserved among psl proteins, except those of poaceae ospsl <dig>  sipsl <dig> and bdpsl <dig> showing a serine- <dig>  likely a substitution occurred after the separation of monocots from dicots. gmpsl <dig> and sbpsl <dig> lack this residue due to pinc domain truncation at leucine- <dig> and lysine- <dig>  respectively. as compared to hsmg <dig>  the majority of plants showed a serine instead of threonine- <dig> that is present only in ptpsl <dig>  sipsl <dig>  smpsl <dig> and vvpsl <dig>  this substitution should not compromise the pinc activity since serine and threonine are the most represented residues at this position in pinc domains of different organisms  <cit> . based on the evidence that the three aspartate residues of pinc domain are crucial for rnase activity, we can argue that psls lacking one of these residues or showing aminoacid with different polarity  have no enzymatic activity. however, we cannot exclude that they are partners of other proteins retaining rnase activity. indeed, in human, it is known that hsmg <dig> lacking two aspartate residues respect to hsmg <dig> has no enzymatic activity but the interaction between hsmg <dig> and hsmg <dig> led to a functional nuclease activity of smg7-smg <dig> complex  <cit> .

functional analysis of arabidopsis ps <dig> reinforced the evidence that the defects in meiotic spindle orientation in meiosis ii led to the formation of diplopollen. among the analysed species, manihot esculenta  was reported to produce 2n pollen but the cytological mechanisms underlying its formation were not deeply investigated  <cit> . since the predicted mepsl protein has fha and pinc active sites similar to those of other species, it is likely that the mechanism leading to 2n pollen in manihot esculenta does not involve parallel spindles.

in the potato genotype analysed in this study, neither spindle defects nor 2n pollen have been reported  <cit> . in this genotype, we identified three psl loci and seven transcripts. based on atps <dig> characterized by fha and pinc domains we can suspect that psl1a and psl3c, carrying both domains, are functional proteins. in addition, it can be speculated that psl1a that evidences the same pinc active residues of atps <dig> is the strongest candidate for the regulation of spindle orientation in meiosis ii. the landscape of alternative splicing in potato psl is not surprising since it has been already observed for genes involved in arabidopsis meiosis. for instance, atspo11- <dig>  involved in double strand breaks  required for meiotic recombination, exhibits up to ten splicing forms showing ptcs  <cit> . as inferred for atspo11- <dig>  psls are possible target of nmd that could act as a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway for the proper expression of psl. alternative splicing was observed also in glycine max but the lack of ptcs exclude nmd regulation of psl transcripts. defining the ligands of fha and pinc domains and proving psl as a component in nmd are essential to link psls to plant evolution by polyploidization via 2n gametes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that psls are common genes across viridaeplantae. we provide evidence that psls occur mostly as singleton in the analyzed genomes except in soybean and potato both characterized by a recent event of whole genome duplication. we provide useful insight into evolutionary preservation of fha and pinc domains throughout plant psl genes, suggesting a fundamental role of these domains for psl function. fha appeared to be highly conserved, while pinc secondary structure and specific active sites showed a less conserved landscape, suggesting a functional diversification among psl genes.
