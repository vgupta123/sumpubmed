BACKGROUND
analysing gene expression using microarrays is a well established method  <cit> . many different technologies have been developed, of which the most advanced are affymetrix genechip  <cit>  and illumina sentrix beadchip arrays  <cit> . these high throughput technologies allow the parallel quantification of a large number of transcripts. it is well known in the microarray community that normalization has to be performed to minimize systematic effects that are not constant between different samples of an experiment and that are not due to the factors under investigation .

several studies comparing different normalization methods have already been conducted, many of them focusing on affymetrix chips  <cit> , others on illumina chips  <cit> , and only very few have been conducted focusing on both technologies  <cit> . to our knowledge, so far no analysis has been published comparing a large number of different normalization methods for the illumina beadchip technology and only very few studies  <cit>  that took the normalizations offered by beadstudio into account and compared them to other established normalization methods. optimal selection of a normalization method depends very heavily on the nature of the experiment. in this regard factors like comparability and quality of single runs play a major role. it has been shown that the normalization method used may influence further downstream analysis to a great extent  <cit>  and thus has to be carefully chosen based on the actual data.

here we present a strategy for an in depth evaluation of normalization methods aiming at identifying the most appropriate one for a given data set. our study compares established normalization methods available in the r environment to those offered by beadstudio software. it focuses on the humanht- <dig> v <dig> expression beadchip, yet the underlying principles are directly transferable to other technologies measuring gene expression. analyses described here provide the basis for the phenocopy project . within this project, the aim is to predict mode of action as well as off-target effects of compounds based on gene expression data. to do so, hacat cells were treated with tgf-β as well as seven different compounds in seven dosages and with six sirnas. gene expression was measured after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours using illumina's human ht- <dig> v <dig> expression beadchips  <cit> . in addition we performed qrt-pcrs using the taqman® technology to measure the quantitative abundance of eight genes at three time points that are known to be deregulated  <cit> . in order to identify the normalization method best suited for the experimental design of the phenocopy project, we, in total, compared  <dig> different ways of normalization and analysed different statistical aspects of the data.

RESULTS
expression data was pre-processed in  <dig> different ways . we focused on analysing the tgf-β stimulated and control samples measured at three time points  in four replicates. generally speaking, first either background normalization from beadstudio  <cit>   or no background modification  has been applied. in a next step, the data was transformed using either log2-transformation  or variance-stabilizing transformation   <cit> . since beadstudio's background normalization can lead to negative values, the data had to be transformed to contain only positive values by using either the background correction of rma  <cit>  or forcepos  <cit>  to be able to apply log2-transformation. in a last step, the data was normalized using quantile, loess, or rsn  <cit>  normalization. alternatively, the transformation steps were skipped and vsn  <cit>  or the normalization methods supplied by beadstudio  are used for normalization.

different pre-processing methods were evaluated by analysing the variance of the resulting gene expression intensities via various statistical measures. some of these have already been used in other studies  <cit> . in addition to the investigation of the actual expression intensities, fold changes derived from resulting gene expression intensities were compared to fold changes based on quantitative measurements of rna abundance as determined by qrt-pcr. thereby, it is possible to evaluate the pre-processing methods with respect to their bias.

pre-processing methods were scored from - <dig> to  <dig> based on how well they match the required criteria for the different analyses described in this section. as it is difficult to clearly categorize the methods based on the examined measures, the final decision of which score to assign to some extent stays subjective. however, it is unambiguously possible to separate better pre-processing methods from worse. a complete overview of the scores assigned and the final ranking is given in figure  <dig> 

analyses of variance based on expression measurements
one basic assumption of gene expression pre-processing methods is that the majority of genes do not change their expression under different conditions. additionally, expression intensities of replicates should be very similar compared to the expression of transcripts between differently treated sample groups. based on these principles, we looked at different statistical measures to identify the method best suited for our dataset with respect to variance.

distribution of f-test statistics
a good normalization method should minimize the variation within a treatment group. furthermore, the variation within a treatment group should be smaller than the variation between groups. the f-statistic is a typical measurement to compare the variation between replicates to the variation between conditions or treatment groups  <cit> . results for the f-statistic based on the gene expression measured for the untreated hacat cells after  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h are displayed in figure  <dig>  four beadstudio normalization methods  show cumulative distribution functions that are clearly above those obtained based on all other pre-processing methods. applying neither background correction nor any normalization method  results in a data set producing less adjusted p-values <  <dig>  than other pre-processing methods. with decreasing significance of the adjusted p-values more pre-processing methods produce fewer p-values of higher significance than nobg_nonorm. based on the data set used, we expect only a small subset of the transcripts to be significantly deregulated. since for bg_nonorm compared to other pre-processing methods the fewest genes would be detected as being differentially expressed, i.e. showing a relatively high variation between compared to within group variability, this method seems to provide the best results. the remaining pre-processing methods perform relatively similar and equally well.

p-values against variance between groups
assuming a stable variance over the within group measurements, the bigger the variance between the groups, the bigger the respective -log <dig> should be. when plotting these parameters, an appropriate normalization method should result in smoothly increasing values with not too much scattering around the fitted curve. figure  <dig> displays the -log <dig> against the respective variance between the control groups at time points  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h for three of the pre-processing methods, an overview over all results is given in additional file  <dig>  normalizations reflecting the described properties are for example nobg_cubicspline, nobg_log_rsn, nobg_vst_rsn, and nobg_vsn. all of the normalizations performed on rma background corrected data as well as bg_vsn display a relatively high -log <dig> for a relatively high proportion of low between group variability values leading to a high scattering of observations in these regions. using, for example, the rank invariant normalization of beadstudio  the p-values for the low between group variability tend to be relatively small. this could lead to an overestimation of differentially expressed genes when filtering solely based on p-values.


boxplots of msqbetween and msqwithin
further indications for good normalization are the distributions of between  and within  group variances and their relation to each other. if genes are not differentially expressed, msqbetween should be comparable to msqwithin. for genes that are differentially expressed, msqbetween is supposed to be higher than msqwithin. figure  <dig> displays the boxplots for msqbetween  and msqwithin  values. since we expect some genes to be differentially deregulated across the different time points under consideration, quantiles of msqwithin values should lie below the corresponding quantiles of the msqbetween values. for the differentially expressed genes, within group variance should be smaller than between group variance, whereas for the genes not differentially expressed, the respective msqbetween and msqwithin values should show no great difference. small interquartile ranges  of msqwithin are indicative for a comparable variability between genes.

to judge the values for msq, an msqbetween was calculated for artificial group means of log <dig> expression values for three time points based on four replicates. the group means used were  which resulted in an msqbetween of  <dig> , indicated by a dashed grey line in figure  <dig>  the mean expression values of the artificial groups have been chosen such that they exhibit a log <dig> ratio of  <dig> when group  <dig> is compared to group  <dig> or group  <dig>  reflecting a relevant difference between those groups. a good normalization method should result in similar expression values for replicates and thus in small msqwithin values hardly crossing this artificial msqbetween. additionally, since we limited the whole data set to expressions measured for untreated hacat cells across time, we expect only few genes to be differentially expressed. thus, only a few genes are assumed to result in an msqbetween above the artificial msqbetween.

almost all boxplots representing msqwithin of background normalized data  result in outliers crossing the artificial msqbetween, only those transformed using vst do stay below. compared to other pre-processing methods, nobg_vst_loess, nobg_log_loess, and bg_vst_loess show a relatively wide iqr for both, msqbetween and msqwithin. methods that meet the described behaviour by showing a low within group variability for which the quantiles generally exhibit lower values than the quantiles of the between group variabilities are bg_vst_quantile, bg_vst_rsn, nobg_log_quantile, nobg_log_rsn, nobg_nonorm, nobg_vsn, nobg_vst_quantile, and nobg_vst_rsn.

density functions of msqbetween and msqwithin
density functions of msqbetween and msqwithin should exhibit clear differences. this fact renders density functions of msqbetween and msqwithin as an additional option for investigating these values. within group variability should be smaller than between group variability and most of the genes should show a between group variability similar to the within group variability, i.e. are not differentially expressed. thus, the mode of msqwithin should be smaller than the mode of msqbetween and the peak of the function for msqwithin is supposed to be higher than the peak for msqbetween. lean msqwithin functions, on the one hand, reflect a comparable within group variability for many genes. on the other hand, broader msqbetween functions indicate that at least some of the genes, i.e. the differentially expressed ones, show a higher between than within group variability. ideal characteristics of density functions as described here are very similar to the characteristics of ideal boxplots mentioned in the previous section. in contrast to density functions, boxplots give a very rough idea about the distribution of the values, also depicting outliers. density functions deliver a more detailed view of how the values are distributed across different ranges.

a small overlap of the functions like for the values generated by the nobg_average normalization  would indicate the unlikely event that most of the genes show a higher between than within group variability, i.e. are differentially expressed. thus, this normalization method is probably not adequate.

volcano plots
volcano plots constitute a standard visualisation of microarray results. they are generated by plotting -log <dig> versus the respective log <dig> ratios. due to the tendency of larger log <dig> ratios being connected to more significant -log <dig> a volcano like shape is generated. pairwise comparisons  using a moderated t-statistic  <cit>  were performed to calculate log <dig> ratios and p-values. our aim is to detect normalization procedures yielding as correct estimates of log <dig> ratios as possible combined with as informative p-values as possible. as mentioned above higher log <dig> ratios should tend to have higher -log <dig>  the loess fits of the log <dig> ratios and -log <dig> pairs  of the volcano plots shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> shall neither be too flat nor too narrow and the scatter of the p-values for specific log <dig> ratios should not be too large.

all volcano plots based on rma background corrected data do not look very promising. the fitted curves are rather flat, i.e. even for high absolute log <dig> ratios the -log <dig> are relatively low. additionally, the -log <dig> for similar log <dig> ratios tend to scatter extremely. some volcanos, e.g. bg_average, bg_nonorm, bg_rankinvariant, and nobg_rankinvariant, show an unsymmetrical relation between p-values for negative and positive log <dig> ratios. especially nobg_rankinvariant exhibits a bias towards small negative log <dig> ratios for which the respective -log <dig> seem to be relatively high. in this region the fitted curve shows a very steep, linear course. volcano plots generated for all other methods are similar to what would be expected. still they differ in the variance of the p-values and in that some of the fitted curves show a flatter shape than others. this reflects the fact that some normalization methods generate a smaller variance than others, resulting in lower fold changes but more significant p-values. ultimately, a method with a reasonable trade off between fold change and variance has to be chosen and cut-off parameters for interesting genes have to be defined accordingly. volcano plots best reflecting the desired properties in the context of our experiment were generated by nobg_log_quantile, nobg_log_rsn, and nobg_vsn. they show the least scattering of values around the fitted curves, but they probably underestimate fold changes. plots produced bye bg_forcepos_log_loss, bg_forcepos_log_quantile, bg_forcepos_log_rsn, bg_vst_quantile, bg_vst_rsn, nobg_cubicspline, nobg_log_loess, nobg_vst_loess, nobg_vst_quantile, and nobg_vst_rsn also fulfil the above mentioned criteria, but show more scattering.

residual standard deviation against mean and minimum of gene expression levels
in an optimally normalized experiment the residual standard deviation of fitted gene expression intensities should be low and independent of the expression levels, i.e. the variance over the different expression levels should be stable. this is prerequisite for many statistical methods, like for example linear model fitting and moderate t-statistics  <cit> , that are utilised for analysing gene expression data.

as displayed in figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  all of the methods without background normalization  show a moderate or low variance in regions of no or hardly to measure expression. in contrast, nearly all of the background corrected methods  result in high and, compared to the other methods, instable variance in the range of low intensity values. extreme examples especially are rma background corrections and bg_vsn normalization procedures. an exception constitute methods using background normalization in conjunction with variance-stabilizing transformation  which in contrast to other procedures using background corrections perform especially well.

methods which perform best with respect to variance stabilization across all expression levels are bg_vst_loess, bg_vst_quantile, bg_vst_rsn, nobg_vst_loess, nobg_vst_quantile, and nobg_vst_rsn.

scatterplots of expression values
scatterplots are an easy and straightforward visualisation tool for judging the comparability of replicates. they clearly show whether high variances are to be expected and, if this is the case, in which range of the expression data. figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> display the expression values of replicates plotted against each other. our results by and large confirm previous findings. some of the methods, for example bg_rma_log_loess, bg_rma_log_quantile, bg_rma_log_rsn, and bg_vsn, show high variance especially in the range of lower expression. plots generated based on these procedures exhibit high variability between replicates. some of the methods like for example bg_nonorm, bg_vst_loess, and nobg_average lead to asymmetric scatterplots indicating a bias in the expression values and a higher variability between replicates. methods that perform well in stabilizing the variance across different expression levels, for example bg_vst_quantile, bg_vst_rsn, nobg_vst_loess, nobg_vst_quantile, and nobg_vst_rsn, could also be confirmed by the scatterplots. additionally to those, nobg_cubicspline and nobg_rankinvariant exhibit symmetric scatterplots with a very low degree of variance between replicates.

pseudo-roc curves
in order to compensate for missing spike-in and dilution data a pseudo-roc approach  <cit>  mimicking the presence of true negatives has been conducted. the pseudo-roc curve for each normalization method is a linear transformation of the true roc curve. common single number summaries used to score and compare roc curves - the area under the curve  or the sensitivity at a given false positive rate - are area or distance based, and thus reduced by this transformation, but to the same degree for every curve. aiming at the validation of normalization methods with respect to their ability to generate data exhibiting a good sensitivity to specificity ratio, expression intensities derived from tgf-β treated versus untreated cells at  <dig> h were compared. based on the roc curves' auc , all normalization methods perform relatively well in delivering values suited for separating true positives from true negatives. to assign quality values to the roc curves, the auc values were sorted and subsequently allocated to three bins of sizes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  finally the bins were assigned quality values of - <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . bg_rankinvariant performs best with an auc of  <dig> , whilst bg_vst_loess performs worst with an auc of  <dig> .

analyses of bias based on qrt-pcr
qrt-pcr has been performed for mrnas from eight genes that are known to be deregulated by tgf-β signalling to a varying degree . by this means, it is possible to compare the results of the normalization methods to values that reflect the real abundance of the respective mrna in the cells. thus, we are able to evaluate the accuracy of the different pre-processing methods with respect to their bias. to guarantee that the comparisons of the normalization methods are not biased towards certain intensities, the mrnas used in qrt-pcr experiments were chosen such that the respective signals on the chips cover a broad range of expression intensities .

correlation analysis of fold changes
based on the different normalization procedures for the gene expression experiment and based on the qrt-pcr measurements , pearson correlations of the respective fold changes measured for tgf-β stimulated versus untreated cells at  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours were calculated. figure  <dig> displays the ranked correlation coefficients describing the relation between the different normalization methods and the taqman results. quality values were assigned based on correlation cut-offs. a value of  <dig> is assigned to correlation coefficients ≥  <dig> , a value of  <dig> to coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig> , a value of  <dig> to coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig> , a value of - <dig> to coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and a value of - <dig> to correlation coefficients ≤  <dig>  . values derived from most of the methods not utilising background correction  show a lower correlation to the taqman results than expression intensities that are background corrected . an exception in this regard are methods that are based on vst transformation . these three methods are amongst the six methods resulting in the lowest correlation coefficient values. correlation coefficients exhibiting high values are delivered by methods introducing beadstudio's background correction combined with either rma background correction and log2-transformation , cubic spline normalization , or variance stabilizing normalization .

regression analysis
to investigate the linear relationship between fold changes as determined by taqman and gene expression data, a linear regression analysis was performed by minimizing the sum of squares of the euclidean distance of points to the fitted line . this method was chosen because there is no clear assignment of dependent and independent variables. figure  <dig> displays the ranking of the different methods according to the slopes of the orthogonal regressions. following rules apply for results of these analyses: the closer the slope is to  <dig>  the better the respective normalization method reflects the qrt-pcr results in a linear manner. in this situation the deviation of the intercept from  <dig> indicates a constant under- or overestimation of the change of mrna abundance across the whole range of fold changes. an intercept <  <dig> stands for an underestimation and an intercept >  <dig> for an overestimation of fold changes. in the case that the slope deviates from  <dig> the difference between qrt-pcr based fold changes and normalized expression based fold changes depends on the size of the fold change. here, on the one hand, an intercept near  <dig> implies a continuous over-  or underestimation . depending on the slope, an intercept deviating from  <dig>  on the other hand, indicates overestimation for a certain range of values and underestimation for another range of values. regardless of the intercept, the most important point in our case is that the scatterplots are generally linear, with low variability and a slope close to  <dig>  in accordance to previous results, all expression values that are transformed using vst together with nobg_rankinvariant result in slopes that exhibit the largest deviation from  <dig>  fold changes calculated based on rma background correction and log2-transformation  best fit the qrt-pcr results .

CONCLUSIONS
it is important to select appropriate pre-processing methods for a given data set based on the experimental setup used. on the one hand, if sample sizes of the different groups are relatively small, it is crucial to achieve a homogeneous variance for the groups. on the other hand, if sample sizes are large, variances can be estimated separately and one should focus on unbiased fold changes. since the sample sizes for the current data set are rather small , a stable variance is more important than an exact representation of the fold change. in general, the data should be normalized without too much reducing real variations. figure  <dig> summarizes the quality measures for all methods we investigated, demonstrating the background for the final choice. clustering of the quality scores assigned reveals two major tendencies based on background normalization. on the one hand, data that was background normalized  tend to better reflect the real fold changes, i.e. show less bias. on the other hand, pre-processing without background normalization  leads to a more homogeneous variance. accurately defined, constant experimental conditions across all experiments as well as their parallel conduction probably have lead to a relatively consistent background level across all samples. since background correction could introduce additional variation, these could be the reasons why, for our data set, data that was not background normalized  in general provides better stabilization of variance than background normalized data . methods combining background normalization with vst  constitute an exception. here, vst leads to a better stabilization of variance while introducing more bias. as vst estimates an offset for the background based on the data  <cit> , nobg_vst_* and bg_vst_* pre-processing methods could lead to similar results.

one has to keep in mind that, based on the individual analyses, there are several methods resulting in nearly equal quality. therefore, it is not possible to give a well-defined rationale for using only one specific method. after excluding the methods that clearly violate the imposed criteria, the decision is still subjective. it, for example, depends on whether one would like to account for a good estimate of fold changes or a small and homogeneous variance. finally the decision remains based on experience; yet, with the analyses and criteria described here, we provide a recommendation on how to pre-select appropriate methods. since, for our data set, we intended to achieve a low and homogeneous variance, we provided more and to a certain degree overlapping statistics investigating variance. in case the focus is on a good estimate of the fold change, the researcher should higher account for statistics investigating this measure. correlation to qrt-pcr or slope and intercept of the regression between qrt-pcr and gene expression fold changes are examples of analyses that could be of higher interest in this context. focusing on variance, best suited for the data set analysed here are nobg_log_quantile and nobg_log_rsn. although log2-transformation in combination with quantile normalization has been approved as performing relatively well by du et al.  <cit>  and dunning et al.  <cit> , we decided to make use of robust spline normalization . in addition to our measures it was selected because rsn is aiming at combining the positive effects of quantile normalization, i.e. preservation of the rank order, and spline interpolation, i.e. continuous mapping of the values, but at the same time circumventing their drawbacks, i.e. discontinuous mapping of intensity values and no rank preservation, respectively  <cit> . surprisingly, the use of vst as recommended by dunning et al.  <cit>  and by du et al. <cit>  and the combination of vst with rsn as successfully used by du et al.  <cit>  did not perform as well as expected. reasons for this could be the different experimental setups  or the use of a newer illumina chip technology, namely humanht- <dig> v <dig> chips, in our experiment. vst has been validated based on a pre-released version of the humanref- <dig> v <dig> expression beadchip that contained  <dig>  to  <dig>  beads per probe. on the humanht- <dig> v <dig> chips an average of only  <dig> beads per probe is available. since vst makes use of those technical replicates, this could lead to a slightly worse performance on the new chip generation. in general, vst still performs well in stabilizing the variance but is outperformed by nobg_log_quantile, nobg_log_rsn, and nobg_vsn in reflecting the results measured by qrt-pcr. when utilising beadstudio normalizations, in accordance with dunning et al.  <cit>  who advised against the use of background normalization, we recommend using cubic spline without background normalization . as displayed in figure  <dig>  nobg_cubicspline outperforms all other beadstudio normalization methods.

spike-in or dilution data is frequently used for evaluating different normalization methods  <cit> . if no such data is available for the microarray chip type used, we propose to perform qrt-pcr for genes covering different spectra of expression intensities in order to obtain a measure for judging the quality of pre-processing methods. thereby, it becomes possible to get an idea of how well different normalization methods are able to reflect the real changes in expression intensities across different expression levels.

in summary, we provide statistical measures based on which researchers can decide on the best suited pre-processing scenario for their own experimental design. if no spike-in data is available, we recommend conducting qrt-pcr for selected, representative transcripts. thereby, it is possible to estimate the bias of log <dig> ratios obtained from normalized data. in conjunction with the measures for the variability of the data finally the basis for weighing well measured changes versus low and homogeneous variance is delivered and by this means selecting an appropriate normalization method is possible.
