BACKGROUND
umbilical cord blood  is increasingly used as an alternative source of transplantable cd34+ haematopoietic stem cells  for neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases  <cit> . the function of cd <dig> antigen on human hsc is poorly understood. it has been shown that small interfering rna-mediated gene silencing of cd <dig> on human hsc from ucb favours granulocytic and megakaryocytic development at the expense of erythroid commitment, thus shedding light into the potential functional role of this molecule during haematopoietic differentiation  <cit> . in recent years, hsc with a cd34- phenotype have been identified in human ucb, unravelling a hitherto unrecognized complexity within the haematopoietic hierarchy  <cit> . previously, we characterized a rare subpopulation of human ucb cd34-cd133-cd7-lineage- cells capable of differentiating both into cd34+cd133+ hsc in response to stem cell factor , and into nk/lymphoid progenitors if supported by interleukin - <dig> and stromal cells engineered to release human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor  and il- <dig>  <cit> . in line with this, ucb-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been used to support nk cell expansion induced by the combination of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and flt3-l  <cit> . similarly, wharton's jelly cells may serve as feeder cells to expand ucb-derived cd34+ hsc in a potentially clinically applicable culture system  <cit> . it should be pointed out that mesenchymal stem cells may activate allogeneic t cells during in vitro hsc expansion  <cit> , suggesting need for feeder cell-free culture systems that may support hsc expansion in the absence of untoward effects on other cell types.

il- <dig> is a four-helix bundle cytokine released by activated cd4+ t cells and by nkt cells  <cit> . il- <dig> signals through a heterodimeric receptor comprising the il- <dig> receptor and the common γc of the il- <dig> receptor family. il- <dig> affects the differentiation and proliferation of nk cells together with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  and is involved in the differentiation of t-helper  <dig>  cells, a recently identified subset of cd4+ t cells that produce il-17a, il-17f and il- <dig> and promote inflammatory and autoimmune conditions  <cit> . in addition, il- <dig> suppresses the differentiation of foxp3-expressing regulatory t cells, leading to enhanced cytotoxic t lymphocyte  expansion and activity  <cit> . finally, il- <dig> is a key regulator of antibody responses against foreign antigens  <cit> , suggesting that il- <dig> may be a master orchestrator of the t-cell-dependent adaptive immune response.

in mice, il- <dig> acts in concert with il- <dig> to boost the proliferation of both memory and naïve cd8+ t cells and to foster the in vitro release of ifn-γ  <cit> . interestingly, il- <dig> selectively enhances the effector functions of il-15-activated murine nk cells, further underpinning the importance of functional interactions between the two cytokines, and mediates potent in vivo anti-tumour responses  <cit> . when provided to serum-replenished cultures of ucb cd34+lineage- cells, il- <dig> in combination with il- <dig>  il- <dig>  flt3-l and scf reportedly induces an accelerated nk cell maturation  <cit> . furthermore, il- <dig> cooperates with hydrocortisone, il- <dig> and flt3-l in supporting the expansion of nk cells from ucb cd34+ cells  <cit> . however, the contribution of il- <dig>  if any, to the nk cell differentiation of cd34-lineage- cells has not been investigated. it is also unknown whether cd34-lineage- cells stimulated with il- <dig> may give rise to a qualitatively different nk population when compared to cd34+ hsc.

the present study aimed to address whether il- <dig> might replace the stromal cell requirements and foster the il-15-induced nk differentiation of human ucb cd34-lineage- cells.

RESULTS
isolation and phenotypic characterisation of ucb cd34-lineage- cells
freshly isolated cd34-lineage- cells stained negatively for stem cell-associated  and nk/lymphoid surface antigens , and comprised  <dig> % on average of ucb mononuclear cells . the aforementioned frequency of cd34- cells is in good agreement with that reported by others  <cit> . cd34-lineage- cells expressed low levels of il- <dig> receptor protein . the expression of il- <dig> receptor in control samples, e.g., ucb cd34+ hsc and human peripheral blood b cells, is shown in figure 1b and figure 1c, respectively. following the observation that stat1/stat <dig> deficient cd8+ t cells manifest decreased responsiveness to il- <dig>  <cit> , we attempted to determine whether il- <dig> induced stat protein phosphorylation in cd34-lineage- cells. when freshly isolated cd34-lineage- cells were stimulated with  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig> for  <dig> hours, both phosphorylated stat <dig> and phosphorylated stat <dig> were induced, whereas phosphorylated stat <dig> levels remained unaffected .

cd34-lineage- cells were next maintained with scf and flt3-l for up to  <dig> weeks, and il- <dig> or il- <dig> or the combination of both cytokines was supplemented to scf+flt3-l-containing cultures as indicated in the figure legends. either il- <dig> alone or, even more dramatically, the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig> activated the proliferation of cd34-lineage- cells . after culturing with flt3-l and scf supplemented with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  cd34-lineage- cells were expanded by  <dig> -fold on average , in contrast with the effects of flt3-l and scf either alone or supplemented with il- <dig> or il- <dig> individually. control cultures were comprised of ucb cd34+ cells exposed to the same cytokine combinations as the cd34-lineage- cells. cd34+ cells were incapable of responding to il- <dig> alone , in accordance with previous reports demonstrating lack of il- <dig> receptor expression on freshly isolated cd34+ cells  <cit> . as illustrated in figure 2c, cd34+ cells expanded vigorously in response to flt3-l and scf, either alone or supplemented with il- <dig>  however, proliferation was significantly increased in cd34+ cell cultures containing both il- <dig> and il- <dig>  indicating synergistic effects of the two γc signalling cytokines. interestingly, cd34+ cell expansion promoted by flt3-l and scf was constrained by the addition of il- <dig> . not unexpectedly, cd34-lineage- cells nurtured with il- <dig> either alone or in combination with il- <dig> acquired a peculiar lymphoid morphology with eccentric nuclei and heavy cytoplasmic granules .

we investigated the expression of an array of potentially informative activation/differentiation antigens on cytokine-modulated cd34-lineage- cells. the results of immunophenotypic studies are summarised in table  <dig>  as depicted in figure  <dig>  neither cd158a nor cd158b antigens could be detected on il-15-differentiated cd34-lineage- cells. consistent with the surface phenotype assigned to pseudo-mature nk cells  <cit> , a minute percentage  of il-15+il-21-differentiated cells expressed cd158a and cd158b, indicating that killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors  were not induced by either cytokine on cd34-lineage- cells. whereas cd <dig> was highly expressed by cd34-lineage- cells cultured with either il- <dig> alone or the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  a minor subset of cd56+cd16+ cells could be consistently detected both in cultures maintained with il- <dig> alone and in those nurtured with il-15+il- <dig>  nkp <dig>  a nk triggering receptor  <cit> , was found on significantly higher percentages of cells cultured with il- <dig> and il- <dig> compared with those maintained with il- <dig> alone. conversely, the cd94-nkg2a inhibitory receptor complex was expressed by comparable percentages of il-15-differentiated and il-21/il-15-differentiated cd34-lineage- cells . finally, nkg2d, a powerful activating receptor involved in the regulation of immune responses during infection, cancer and autoimmunity  <cit> , was preferentially detected on cd34-lineage- cells cultured with il- <dig> and il- <dig> . the immunophenotypic characteristics of nk cells differentiated in vitro from ucb cd34+ cells and those of nk cells from ucb and peripheral blood are depicted in figure  <dig>  when compared with cd34-derived nk cells and with pre-formed nk cells, cd34-lineage- cells emerging from il-15+il-21-containing cultures expressed very low levels of cd <dig> and kir, but high levels of cd <dig>  nkg2d and il- <dig> receptor. because nkg2d expression may be negatively regulated by tgf-β  <cit> , we added exogenous tgf-β at  <dig> ng/ml to cd34-lineage- cells concomitant with their exposure to il- <dig> and il- <dig>  under these conditions, less than 5% of developing nk cells stained positively for nkg2d , suggesting that nkg2d expression induced by il- <dig> and il- <dig> was sensitive to cytokine regulation. insufficient numbers of cells for detailed phenotypic analyses were recovered from cultures performed with flt3-l and scf either alone or supplemented with il- <dig>  thus precluding a thorough evaluation of the expression pattern of nk cell-associated antigens on those cell populations .

molecular profile of il-21-differentiated cd34-lineage- cells
we next aimed to get insights into the expression levels of mrna encoding for nk-associated transcription factors. the provision of il- <dig> and il- <dig> to cd34-lineage- cells was associated with up-regulated mrna signals for bcl- <dig>  gata- <dig> and, perhaps more importantly, id <dig>  a master switch implicated in the commitment of bi-potent foetal thymus t/nk progenitors to nk cells   <cit> . notably, bcl- <dig> induction by il- <dig> has also been demonstrated in t cells, leading to their enhanced survival through the activation of the pi-3k signalling pathway  <cit> .

because t-cell precursors residing in the foetal liver, spleen and blood possess nk lineage potential, we aimed to determine whether nk differentiation in response to il- <dig> and il- <dig> occurred in association with tcr rearrangement. previously, we have detected rearranged tcrγ genes in cd34-lineage- ucb cells cultured with il- <dig> and a stromal cell support  <cit> . the tcrγ chain gene has  <dig> constant ,  <dig> joining  and  <dig> variable  region segments. most variable region  rearrangements occur within the vγ1– <dig> subgroup and most joining region  rearrangements involve the jγ1/ <dig> segment  <cit> . in order to increase tcrγ rearrangement detection rate, we used multiple primer sets specific for c and j regions of the tcrγ chain, as detailed in materials and methods. as shown in figure 4b, cd34-lineage- cells cultured with il- <dig> and il- <dig> harboured un-rearranged tcrγ genes, similar to freshly isolated cd34-lineage- cells and to cells maintained with scf and flt3-l either alone or supplemented with il- <dig>  this observation suggests that nk commitment under the experimental conditions here established occurs through a pathway that does not include tcr rearrangement.

cytokine/chemokine secretion by il-21-differentiated nk cells
we next determined the ability of il-15+il-21-differentiated cells to release ifn-γ, gm-csf, tnf-α and ccl3/mip-1α in culture supernatants. ifn-γ was undetectable  after cell culture in the presence of scf and flt3-l supplemented with either il- <dig> or il- <dig> alone. in sharp contrast, exposure to il- <dig> and il- <dig> induced a highly significant release of ifn-γ in 4-week old cultures, corresponding to a mean of  <dig> ±  <dig> pg/ml in  <dig> independent experiments. ifn-γ release by cd34+ hsc matured with il- <dig> and il- <dig> was superimposable . gm-csf was undetectable in flt3-l+scf-differentiated cultures but was released at high levels from week + <dig> onward in cd34-lineage- cultures nurtured with il- <dig> alone or with il-15+il- <dig>  conversely, tnf-α was preferentially detected in the supernatants of il-15-differentiated cd34-lineage- cells compared with cells maintained with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  gm-csf and tnf-α release by cd34+ hsc followed a similar pattern, although the magnitude of cytokine release was significantly lower when compared with cd34-lineage- cultures. finally, measurable ccl3/mip-1α secretion occurred under any culture condition that we established. however, ccl3/mip-1α release in response to flt3-l and scf was further enhanced by il- <dig> alone and, to a greater extent, by il- <dig> and il- <dig> in combination . notably, nk cells differentiated with il- <dig> from cd34+ hsc released the highest levels of ccl3/mip-1α. collectively, these experiments suggested that il-15+il-21-differentiated cd34-lineage- cells acquired the ability to release soluble factors relevant for nk effector function and nk migration/homing.

response of il-21-differentiated nk cells to maturation stimuli
we asked whether a cytokine stimulus such as il- <dig> could further mature the population of nk cells differentiated with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  we recovered nk cells from  <dig> week-old cultures of cd34-lineage- cells and cd34+ cells, and we exposed them to exogenous il- <dig> for additional  <dig> hours  <cit> . cells were collected and used to assess the expression of a restricted panel of nk-cell antigens, whereas supernatants were used to measure tnf-α, mip-1α and gm-csf release. as summarised in figure 6a, no appreciable modification of the expression levels of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and kirs occurred after the exposure of il-15- or il-15+il-21-matured nk cells to il- <dig>  in line with this observation, the release of mip-1α, tnf-α and gm-csf was superimposable, irrespective of the provision of il- <dig> to cytokine-differentiated nk cells. whereas il- <dig> induced only a modest increase of cd <dig> expression on cd34-derived nk cells, it significantly enhanced their ability to secrete tnf-α and gm-csf . because equal numbers of cytokine differentiated nk cells were used to detect il-12-induced maturation, these experiments also indicated that tnf-α and gm-csf release on a per cell basis was remarkably higher in cd34-lineage--derived nk cells compared with cd34+-derived nk cells.

functional assays of nk activity
cd34-lineage- cells cultured with il- <dig> and il- <dig> for  <dig> weeks were assayed for nk activity against nk-sensitive tumour cell targets. to this end, cytokine-differentiated cells were first activated with il- <dig> and then co-cultured at escalating effector-to-target ratios with either nk-resistant raji cells or nk-sensitive k <dig> cells for  <dig> hours. the expression of cd107a, a lysosomal protein whose up-regulation reflects exocytosis of secretory granules, on cd56+ nk cells was monitored by flow cytometry  <cit> . control cultures were established with nk cells differentiated from ucb cd34+ cells under the same culture conditions as those applied to cd34-lineage- cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  minor degranulation occurred when nk-resistant raji tumour cells were plated in co-culture with nk cells derived from either cd34-lineage- cells or cd34+ hsc . conversely, an average  <dig> ± 11% of cd56+ nk cells stained positively for cd107a in co-cultures established with nk-sensitive k <dig> cells and nk cells differentiated from cd34-lineage- cells with il- <dig> plus il- <dig>  notably, nk cell degranulation occurred at significantly lower levels in co-cultures containing k <dig> cells and il-15-differentiated cd34-lineage- cells , suggesting that il- <dig> and il- <dig> exerted synergistic effects on nk activity. finally, nk cells differentiated from cd34+ hsc with either il- <dig> alone or il-15+il- <dig> manifested a similar cytotoxic activity to that of cytokine-differentiated cd34-lineage- cells .

discussion
nk cells are important effectors of the innate immune system and exhibit cytolytic activity against infectious agents and tumour cells. although our knowledge of nk-cell developmental intermediates remains limited, advances have recently led to a better definition of appropriate culture conditions for the in vitro generation of mouse and human nk cells from foetal thymus  <cit> , foetal liver  <cit> , ucb  <cit>  and bone marrow hsc  <cit> . in early studies, nk-cell development from purified hsc was shown to be stromal-cell dependent  <cit> . it has later been demonstrated that the stromal-cell requirements may be replaced by the provision of early-acting cytokines such as scf, flt3-l and il- <dig> to the cultures  <cit> . in particular, scf and flt3-l directly induce the expression of il- <dig> receptor-β chain on hsc, thereby rendering them susceptible to the nk-cell commitment induced by il- <dig>  <cit> . prolonged culture of cd34+ hsc with il- <dig> in the absence of stromal cells can generate pseudo-mature lytic nk cells, e.g., cells expressing markers of mature nk cells  but not ly <dig> receptors or kir  <cit> . more recently, ucb cd34+ cells have been differentiated along the nk lineage with flt3-l, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and hydrocortisone but in the absence of any stromal cell support  <cit> . in addition, il- <dig> may synergize with il- <dig>  il- <dig>  scf, flt3-l and serum supplementation in promoting the generation of nk cells from ucb cd34+ cells  <cit> .

the antitumor activity of il- <dig> has been demonstrated in murine experimental models where direct effects of il- <dig> on nk cells were responsible for tumour suppression  <cit> . in addition, the ability of il- <dig> to promote long-lasting cd8+ t-cell-dependent tumour responses has been shown in athymic mice with intraperitoneal or subcutaneous tumours  <cit> . il- <dig> may also augment human t-cell proliferation driven by polyclonal activation or by a peptide in the absence of other stimuli and may increase cd8+ t-cell production of ifn-γ induced by il- <dig>  <cit> . the aforementioned in vitro and pre-clinical findings have prompted the evaluation of il- <dig> as immunotherapy for patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma  <cit> . these studies have clearly shown that repeated cycles of il- <dig> are well tolerated as an outpatient regimen, thus encouraging further development of il- <dig> as an immunotherapy for cancer.

early studies of ucb transplantation for haematological malignancies have demonstrated an impaired rate and quality of immune reconstitution, which may be associated with an increased rate of infectious complications, particularly at early time points after transplantation  <cit> . these clinical observations reinforce the need for novel cell-based therapeutic approaches to overcome the potentially life-threatening infections, including those attributable to a delayed anti-cmv immunity  <cit> .

we provide evidence that il- <dig> favours the nk cell differentiation of cd34-lineage- ucb cells in cooperation with il- <dig> and in the absence of stromal cell support and serum or hydrocortisone supplementation. the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig> displayed a remarkable ability to promote the outgrowth of cd34-lineage- cells into nk cells, at variance with il- <dig> alone. this is backed by previous observations indicating that the γc-dependent cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> may integrate their signalling and synergise in regulating cd8+ t-cell expansion and function  <cit> . using murine mature nk cells, kasaian et al.  <cit>  have shown that il- <dig> may constrain the il-15-induced expansion of nk cells in vitro, although their activation status remains unaffected, underpinning the concept that il- <dig> may exert diverging effects on murine as opposed to human nk cells. it has also been demonstrated that low doses of il- <dig> increase the proliferative response of murine nk cells to either il- <dig> or il- <dig>  whereas high doses of il- <dig> may exert an inhibitory effect on nk cell outgrowth  <cit> . in our study, il- <dig> significantly inhibited the proliferation of cd34+ cells induced by scf and flt3-l, suggesting that il- <dig> may also exert opposite effects on hsc proliferation depending on the concomitant cytokine stimulus that is applied.

it should be emphasised that cd34+ hsc differentiated under the same cytokine conditions expanded more vigorously than their cd34-lineage- counterpart. not unexpectedly, il- <dig> promoted the activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig>  but not stat <dig> protein, in cd34-lineage- cells. nk cells generated in vitro with il- <dig> and il- <dig> acquired a cd56+cd16-/+ phenotype which differs from the phenotype that we previously observed using flt3-l, scf, il- <dig> and a stromal feeder layer, where nk progenitor cells stained negatively for cd <dig>  <cit> . the percentage of cd56-expressing cd34-lineage- cells was significantly higher compared to that in cultures of cd34+ hsc, indicating that the former hsc subset has the ability to give origin to a virtually pure nk cell population when confronted with il- <dig> and il- <dig> in vitro. the natural cytotoxicity receptor nkp <dig> and the nkg2d antigen were strongly up-regulated on cd34-lineage- cells cultured with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the activating receptor nkg2d, whose ligands are frequently over-expressed in tumours from multiple origins  <cit> , could be detected at very low levels in cultures performed with il- <dig> alone. conversely, nkg2d expression levels significantly increased as a result of combined treatment with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  suggesting that the nk cell populations obtained under these culture conditions may represent suitable effectors for cell-based anti-tumour therapeutic approaches. from a molecular standpoint, il- <dig> and il- <dig> induced mrna signals for bcl- <dig>  gata- <dig> and for the nk cell-associated transcription factor id <dig>  interestingly, nk cell differentiation occurred through a pathway that does not involve tcr rearrangement, indicating that the nk intermediates originating from ucb cd34-lineage- cells differ from previously described bi-potent nk/t cells  <cit> .

considerable release of ifn-γ only occurred in 4-week old cultures of cd34-lineage- cells maintained with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  conversely, gm-csf and tnf-α could be detected in supernatants of cultures maintained with either il- <dig> alone or il- <dig> plus il- <dig>  significant secretion of tnf-α could be measured preferentially in cultures stimulated with il- <dig> alone. these findings are in good agreement with previous reports on il-21-induced changes of cytokine secretion by ucb-derived cd34+ hsc  <cit> . in the latter study, il- <dig> increased il- <dig> and gm-csf production but lessened tnf-α release after 4-week culturing in the presence of hydrocortisone, flt3-l and il- <dig>  ccl3/mip-1α production occurred under any culture condition herein examined, although the highest production could be documented after challenge with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the robust gm-csf and ifn-γ release induced by il- <dig> and il- <dig> in combination suggests that cytokine-differentiated nk cells may retain the ability to mount effective anti-viral and anti-tumour responses. the significant secretion of ccl3/mip-1α, a chemokine implicated in the selective mobilization of nk cells from the bone marrow compartment into the peripheral blood  <cit> , implies that cytokine-matured nk cells may provide in vivo signals contributing to the regulation of nk homing, retention and migration.

the nk cell populations differentiated with il- <dig> and il- <dig> were resistant to further maturation with il- <dig>  as evaluated both in terms of surface membrane phenotype and in terms of cytokine/chemokine release. specifically, the expression levels of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and kir were similar irrespective of the provision of exogenous il- <dig>  similarly, ccl3/mip-1α, tnf-α and gm-csf release were superimposable in cultures of il-15+il-21-differentiated cells that were either stimulated with il- <dig> or left untouched.

finally, the nk cells differentiated with il- <dig> and il- <dig> underwent exocytosis of secretory granules, as measured by a flow cytometry-based cd107a degranulation assay, upon co-culturing for  <dig> hours with nk-sensitive tumour cell targets, indicating the acquisition of cytolytic potential. however, the extent of nk granule exocytosis was comparable to that measured in co-cultures of k <dig> cells and nk cells differentiated from cd34+ hsc with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that considerable numbers of highly pure, lytic cd56+cd16-/+ nk cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be obtained from ucb cd34-lineage- cells using a serum-free, feeder cell-free culture system. from a qualitative standpoint, these nk populations differ from those differentiated from ucb cd34+ hsc insofar they express high levels of the activating receptor nkg2d, release high quantities of ifn-γ, gm-csf and tnf-α and are resistant to maturation with il- <dig>  the findings highlighted herein also shed some light into the developmental intermediates of nk cells that can be differentiated after the exposure of cd34-lineage- cells to il- <dig>
