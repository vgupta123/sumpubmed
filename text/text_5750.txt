BACKGROUND
the herpesvirus envelope contains a variable number of glycoproteins involved in virus attachment, penetration, budding and spreading among infected cells. some of these proteins are extremely conserved in functions and sequences, while others are typical of a peculiar virus genus or species.

the entry model mechanism of human herpes virus  <dig>  is based firstly on the interaction between glycoproteins gc and gb and the host cell heparan sulfates associated with glycosaminoglycans  and secondly, by gd-mediated penetration that is also responsible for the fusion via gb, gh and gl  <cit> . five glycoproteins are conserved in all herpesviruses, gb, gh, gl, gm and gn, and numerous studies have been carried out in order to characterize them  <cit> .

the gb gene is one of the most conserved glycoproteins among the herpesvirus family. homologues of gb have in fact been identified in every human and animal herpesvirus studied  <cit> . the hypothesis that gb function may be conserved in all herpesviruses is corroborated by its secondary structure, that shows the consistent conservation of cysteine and proline residues and the carboxy-terminal portion of the proteins  <cit> .

herpesvirus  <dig>  belongs to the gammaherpesvirus, rhadinovirus genus, and has been isolated worldwide both in healthy animals and in animals with a range of diseases varying from ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, respiratory diseases and abortion  <cit> . the pathogenic role of bohv- <dig> is still unclear, even if there is increasing evidence of a secondary pathogenic role in bovine post-partum metritis  <cit> .

ten glycoproteins have been identified in bohv- <dig>  <cit>  and gb was demonstrated to be involved in cell host contact through heparan sulfate interactions  <cit> . it is not known if this interaction is sufficient to induce virus penetration and fusion or if a cellular receptor is specifically required, as for example occurs for human herpesvirus  <dig>   <cit> . structurally, gb is a heterodimeric protein, composed of two subunits linked by disulfide bonds. the protein is derived from a precursor that is first glycosylated, then trimmed and cleaved to acquire the mature gb form, thanks to a putative cleavage site which is present nearly in the middle of the sequence  <cit> . similarly to human herpesvirus  <dig> , murid herpesvirus  <dig> , human herpesvirus  <dig>  and hhv- <dig>  <cit> , gb is one of the major components of the bohv- <dig> virion. however the direct role of bohv- <dig> gb for the progression of the virus into the lytic cycle has yet to be demonstrated. in the present study, the generation of several tagged soluble forms of bohv- <dig> gb ectodomain was described, and their inability to block viral infectivity was also assessed. the cloning of different isolates of bohv- <dig> genome as bacterial artificial chromosomes   <cit>  allowed the generation of a gb-deleted mutant bohv- <dig>  which provided further evidence that bohv- <dig> gb has an indispensable role in bohv- <dig> lytic replication; moreover vsvg was unable to complement bohv- <dig> gb deletion, underlying the primary role of gb during bohv- <dig> life cycle.

methods
dna preparation and pcr
virus infected cells were lysed overnight in proteinase k buffer containing  <dig> mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> % sodium dodecyl sulfate  and  <dig> μg of proteinase k per ml at 37°c. nucleic acids were extracted by treatment with phenol–chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. treatment with  <dig> μg/ml of rnase a  was performed for  <dig> h, after which the dna was extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol again. the samples were kept at −20°c. one microgram of dna sample was amplified over  <dig> cycles, each cycle consisting of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min, primer annealing at 55°c for  <dig> min, and chain elongation with  <dig> u of pfu dna polymerase  at 72°c for  <dig> min. pcr amplification was carried out in a final volume of  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris–hydrochloride ph  <dig>  containing  <dig>  mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm kcl, 5% dmso and  <dig>  μm of each primer. the primers used for the amplification of bohv- <dig> orf <dig>  coding for gb protein, are sgfi-gb-sense and mlui-gb-antisense . the so generated  <dig> bp amplicon was then checked in 1% agarose gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining in 1× tae buffer  and used to subclone gb in an expression cassette. the specificity of the pcr product was determined by sequencing.


plasmids
to generate pgbfc, bohv- <dig> gb orf  was amplified by pcr using sgfi-gb-sense and mlui-gb-antisense primer , cut with sgfi/mlui and inserted in pcmv6-ac-fc  cut with the same enzymes. gb/fc orf was cut from pgb/fc firstly with bamhi, blunt-ended, consequently cut with pmei and then sub-cloned in pwpi  cut with pmei. thus pwpi/gbfc was obtained.

the chimeric orf  coding for gbtruncated-gd <dig> was obtained by gene synthesis  where an nhei and a bamhi restriction sites were included to the 5′ and 3′ end respectively. this gbtruncatedgd <dig> orf was excised from the vector  by nhei/bamhi digestion and inserted in pegfp-c <dig>  depleted of green fluorescent protein  after cutting with the same enzymes and pcmv-gbtruncatedgd <dig> was obtained. murine fc was then amplified by pcr from pcmv6-ac-fc vector with sali-fc-sense and bamhi-fc-antisense primers  and used to substitute the gd <dig> tag in pcmv-gbtruncatedgd <dig> 

pcmv-gbtruncated-gd <dig> was then cut with ndei and sali and the gbtruncated was exchanged with the full length  <dig> bp gb ectodomain, excised from pgb/fc, cut with ndei and xhoi. sali and xhoi are compatible enzymes and the generated ends are in frame. the so generated pcmvgbgd <dig> was then cut with bamhi, blunt-ended and the fusion peptide gbgd <dig> was inserted in pwpi opened with pmei and pwpi/gbgd106was generated.

pbluescript/gbtruncatedgd <dig> was cut with nhei and bamhi, the fragment was blunt-ended and inserted in pmei cut pwpi to generate pwpi/gbtruncatedgd <dig> 

pcmv-gbtruncatedgd <dig> was cut with sali/bamhi to excise gd <dig> that was replaced with the 752bp sali/bamhi cut murine fc amplicon for generating pcmv-gbtruncatedfc.

the gbtruncatedfc was at the end excised from pcmv-gbtruncatedfc, cut with nhei/bamhi, blunt-ended and inserted in pmei cut pwpi to obtain pwpi/gbtruncatedfc.

ptz-kanagalk, was generated by sub-cloning the  <dig> bp galactokinase prokaryotic expression cassette , along with the kanamycin resistant expression cassette , into the ptz57r shuttle vector, cut with kpni/psti  <cit> . the targeting vector, pgb-kanagalk-gb, was generated firstly by the insertion of the 1167bp left gb homology region amplicon  cut with ecori/kpni, in ptz-kanagalk, cut with the same enzymes; in this intermediate construct, cut with psti/hindiii, was consequently subcloned the 600bp right gb homology region amplicon , cut with the same enzymes.

cells, cell culture electroporation and recombinant virus reconstitution
bovine embryo kidney , mdbk , bek/cre  <cit> , hek  and besc  cell lines were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle minimal essential medium   containing 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig> iu/ml penicillin  and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin .

cells were sub cultured to a fresh culture vessel when growth reached  <dig> to 90% confluence  and were incubated at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air–5% co <dig> 

plasmid dnas  in  <dig> μl dmem without serum were electroporated  into bek or bek/cre cells from a confluent 25-cm <dig> flask. electroporated cells were then returned to the flask, fed the next day, and split 1: <dig> when they reached confluence at  <dig> days post electroporation. cells were left to grow until cytophatic effect  appeared. recombinant viruses were propagated by infecting confluent monolayers of mdbk cells at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  50% tissue culture infectious doses  per cell and maintaining them in mem with 10% fbs for  <dig> h. the medium was removed and replaced by fresh mem containing 10% fbs. when approximately 90% of the cell monolayer exhibited cpe , the virus was prepared by freezing and thawing cells three times and pelleting virions through 30% sucrose, as described previously  <cit> . virus pellets were resuspended in cold mem without fbs. tcid <dig> were determined on mdbk or bek cells by limiting dilution.

viruses
bohv-4-a, bohv-4-a-Δtk-egfp, bac-bohv-4-a, bacbohv-4-aΔl <dig> vsvg, bac-bohv-4-aΔl <dig> vsvgΔgb-kanagalk, and bac-bohv-4-a-Δgb-kanagalk were propagated by infecting confluent monolayers of mdbk or bek cells at a m.o.i. of  <dig>  and maintained in minimal essential medium   with 2% fbs for  <dig> h. the medium was then removed and replaced by fresh mem containing 10% fbs. when approximately 90% of the cell monolayer exhibited cpe , the virus was prepared by freezing and thawing cells three times and pelleting the virions through 30% sucrose, as previously described  <cit> . virus pellets were resuspended in cold mem without fbs. tcid <dig> were determined in mdbk cells by limiting dilution.

in vitro neutralization assay 
hek cells were seeded in a  <dig> cm <dig> flask and when reached the 85% of confluence, were transiently transfected with the plasmids carrying the gb tagged constructs.

in particular,  <dig> ml of dmem without serum were incubated with  <dig>  μl of ltx lipofectamine  and  <dig>  μg of pwpi/gbfc, pwpi/gbtruncatedfc, or pwpi/gbtruncatedgd <dig> at room temperature for at least  <dig> minutes. this transfection solution was then added carefully to the hek cell monolayer and left to incubate  <dig> hours at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  the transfection solution was then removed and replaced by  <dig> ml of 1: <dig> dmem/f <dig> medium without serum, after a washing, to remove any traces of the transfection solution. after  <dig> hours the supernatant was collected, clarified at  <dig> r.p.m. for  <dig> minutes and stored at −20°c.

the expression of gb was assessed by western blotting  and consequently the supernatant was used for the neutralization assay.

 <dig> hek cells/well were seeded in a  <dig> multiwells plate and left to attach to the well.

after few hours the cells were pre-incubated  <dig> minutes at 37°c with 1ml/well of the supernatant recovered from hek transfected with pwpi/gbfc or pwpi/gbtruncatedgd <dig> or pwpi/gbtruncatedfc with medium without serum. the supernatant was then removed and substituted with ten-fold bohv-4-a-Δtk-egfp virus dilution, starting from  <dig> to 10- <dig> m.o.i. the cells were then incubated overnight at 37°c in 5% humidified atmosphere.

this assay was also repeated in besc cells, with the same protocol, but seeding 3× <dig> cells/well in a  <dig> multiwell plate; the cells were then treated with the gb supernatant and infected with two-fold dilutions of the virus, starting from  <dig> m.o.i.

these two protocols were also tested using a contact time varying from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes and/or an incubation contact temperature of 4°c or 37°c.

the virus spreading was then monitored during the following days by fluorescence and contrast microscope analysis.

recombineering and selection
recombineering was performed as previously described  <cit>  with some modifications. five hundred μl of a 32°c overnight culture of sw <dig> containing bac-bohv-4-a, and bac-bohv-4-aΔl <dig> -vsvg were diluted in  <dig> ml luria–bertani  medium with or without chloramphenicol  selection  in a  <dig> ml baffled conical flask and grown at 32°c in a shaking water bath to an od <dig> of  <dig> . then,  <dig> ml were transferred to another baffled  <dig> ml conical flask and heat-shocked at 42°c for exactly  <dig> minutes in a shaking water bath. the remaining culture was left at 32°c as the un-induced control. after  <dig> minutes the two samples, induced and un-induced, were briefly cooled in ice/water bath slurry and then transferred to two  <dig> ml falcon tubes and pelleted using  <dig> r.p.m.  at 0°c for  <dig> min. the supernatant was poured off and the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> ml ice-cold ddh2o by gently swirling the tubes in ice/water bath slurry. subsequently,  <dig> ml ice-cold ddh2o was added and the samples pelleted again. this step was repeated once more, the supernatant was removed and the pellet  was kept on ice until electroporated with gel-purified ~ <dig>  kb fragment  obtained by cutting pgb-kanagalk-gb with ecori/hindiii . an aliquot of  <dig> μl was used for each electroporation in a  <dig>  cm cuvette at  <dig> μf,  <dig>  kv and  <dig> Ω. after electroporation, the bacteria were recovered in  <dig> ml lb  for  <dig> hour in a 32°c shaking water bath. for the counter selection step , the bacteria were recovered in  <dig> ml lb in a  <dig> ml baffled conical flask and incubated for  <dig>  hours in a 32°c shaking water bath.

after the recovery period, bacteria were washed twice in sterile 1x m <dig> salts   as follows:  <dig> ml culture was pelleted in an eppendorf tube at  <dig>  r.p.m. for  <dig> seconds and the supernatant was removed with a pipette. the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> ml of 1× m <dig> salts, and pelleted again. this washing step was repeated once more. after the second wash, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> ml of 1× m <dig> salts before plating serial dilutions  on m <dig> minimal medium plates . washing in m <dig> salts is necessary to remove any rich media from the bacteria prior to selection on minimal medium plates. plates were incubated 3– <dig> days at 32°c. several selected colonies were picked, streaked on mcconkey agar indicator plates  containing  <dig> μg/ml of kanamycin and incubated at 32°c for  <dig> days until red colonies appeared. red colonies were grown overnight in  <dig> ml of lb containing  <dig> μg/ml of kanamycin and bac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk were purified and analysed trough hindiii restriction enzyme digestion for gb-kanagalk-gb fragment targeted integration into the bohv-4-a gb locus.

sw <dig> bacteria containing bac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk genome were also grown, heat induced as described above and electroporated with a ~ <dig> kb gel purified fragment  obtained by amplifying the gb locus with the primers gb-left-sense and gb-right-antisense. for the counter selection step, the bacteria were recovered in  <dig> ml lb in a  <dig> ml baffled conical flask and incubated for  <dig>  hours in a 32°c shaking water bath. bacterial serial dilutions were plated on m <dig> minimal medium plates containing  <dig> g/l agar,  <dig> % glycerol ,  <dig> mg/l d-biotin,  <dig> mg/l l-leucine,  <dig> % 2-deoxy-galactose  and  <dig>  μg/ml chloramphenicol. plates were incubated for 3– <dig> days at 32°c. several selected colonies were picked up, streaked on mcconkey agar indicator plates  containing  <dig>  μg/ml of chloramphenicol and incubated at 32°c for  <dig> days until white colonies appeared. white colonies were grown in duplicate for 5– <dig> hours in  <dig> ml of lb containing  <dig> μg/ml of kanamycin or lb containing  <dig>  μg/ml of chloramphenicol. only those colonies growing on chloramphenicol and not on kanamycin were kept and grown overnight in  <dig> ml of lb containing  <dig>  μg/ml of chloramphenicol. bac-bohv-4-gbrevertant was purified and analysed through hindiii restriction enzyme digestion for gb locus fragment targeted integration. original detailed protocols for recombineering can also be found at the recombineering website  <cit> .

restriction enzyme analysis and non isotopic southern hybridization
fifteen μl of dna prepared from bacteria containing pbac-bohv-4-a and derivatives were restriction enzyme-digested with hindiii, separated by electrophoresis overnight in a  <dig> % agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, capillary transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane , and cross-linked by uv irradiation by standard procedures. the membrane was pre-hybridized in  <dig> ml of hybridization solution  for  <dig> hours at 65°c in a rotating hybridization oven . probe preparation and digoxigenin non-isotopic labelling was performed by pcr.

southern blotting probe was designed spanning kana region using the primer pair smai-asei-kana sense and smai-mlui-kana anti .

pcr amplification was carried out in a final volume of  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig>  mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates,  <dig>  mm alkaline labile digoxigenin-dutp ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm kcl, and  <dig>  μm of each primer over  <dig> cycles, each cycle consisting of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> minute, primer annealing at 55°c for  <dig> minute, and chain elongation with  <dig> u of taq polymerase  at 72°c for  <dig> minute. a parallel reaction omitting digoxigenin-dutp was performed, because digoxigenin incorporation into the amplicon can be checked through the size shift of the amplicon by gel electrophoresis. five μl of the probe were added to  <dig> μl of ddh2o into a screw-cap tube, denatured in boiling water for  <dig> minutes, and cooled down on ice for another  <dig> minutes. denatured probe was added to  <dig> ml of pre-heated 65°c hybridization solution to the pre-hybridized membrane and hybridized overnight at 65°c in a rotating hybridization oven . following hybridization, the membrane was washed twice for  <dig> minutes with  <dig> ml of washing solution i  and twice for  <dig> minutes with  <dig> ml of washing solution ii  at 65°c. on a freshly washed dish, the membrane was incubated for  <dig> min at room temperature in  <dig> ml of blocking solution . anti-digoxigenin fab fragment , diluted 1: <dig>  in  <dig> ml of blocking solution, was applied to the membrane for  <dig> minutes under gentle shaking at room temperature and washed twice for  <dig> minutes with  <dig> ml of washing solution . detection was performed following equilibration of the membrane in detection buffer  for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. chemiluminescent substrate  was added by scattering the drops over the surface of the membrane after placement of the membrane between two plastic sheets, and any bubbles present under the sheet were eliminated with a damp lab tissue to create a liquid seal around the membrane. signal detection was obtained, exposing the membrane to x-ray film. the exposure time was adjusted with the intensity of the signal.

western immunoblotting
cell lysates containing  <dig> μg of total protein were electrophoresed through  <dig> to 12% sds-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nylon membranes by electro blotting. membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-bohv-1-gd antibody , probed with horseradish peroxidase-labelled anti-mouse immunoglobulin g  antibody , and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence . for detecting the fc was used an anti-mouse igg whole molecule .

RESULTS
soluble gb fragments did not inhibit virus attachment and replication
recent studies have demonstrated that hhv- <dig> infection can be prevented by treating cells with a library of peptides homologous to the ectodomain of the hhv- <dig> gb.  <cit> . to verify if bohv- <dig> gb could act as a soluble ligand for a putative bohv- <dig> host cell receptor and block bohv- <dig> infection, bohv- <dig> gb ectodomain was sub-cloned and expressed as a secreted form into the supernatant of transiently transfected cells. bohv- <dig> gb has a length of  <dig> aa and corresponds to an orf of  <dig> bp . several studies have demonstrated that the mature form of gb is heterodimeric and is generated by the presence of an internal putative proteasic site  in the second half of its aminoacidic sequence that is responsible for the cleavage of the two subunits, that are then covalently linked by disulfide bonds   <cit> .


the secreted forms of gb were obtained on the basis of its transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail exclusion and/or substitution. firstly, the full gb ectodomain  was fused to a murine fc tag encoding the hinge region, the ch <dig> and the ch <dig> domains of the mouse igg heavy chain, in order to generate gbfc . thus, gbfc orf was inserted into the pwpi vector  <cit>  and pwpi/gbfc was obtained . in pwpi/gbfc, the expression of gbfc is under the control of the human elongation factor 1α promoter . downstream to the gbfc orf, an internal ribosomal entry site , the gfp orf and a simian virus  <dig>  large t antigen polyadenylation signal  were also present . this polycistronic construct allowed the rapid monitoring of the functionality of the construct by direct visualization of gfp expression by fluorescence microscopy . gbfc was correctly expressed, secreted and post-translationally modified when pwpi/gbfc was transiently transfected into hek cells . in fact, the variation of its size observed in western immunoblotting, was appreciable when the supernatant or protein cell extract from pwpi/gbfc transiently transfected cells were treated or untreated with reducing agents such as dithiothreitol  or β-mercaptoethanol .

.

a truncated form of gb fused to fc was also generated, gbtruncated/fc , where only a part of the gb ectodomain  was fused to fc. also in this case, gbtruncatedfc was correctly expressed, secreted and post-translationally modified when pwpi/gbtruncatedfc was transiently transfected into hek cells . two other versions of gb, gbgd <dig> and gbtruncatedgd <dig> respectively, were generated replacing the fc tag with the gd <dig> soluble epitope tag of bohv- <dig> in order to verify the influence of the tag peptide fused with gb in terms of secretion .

surprisingly, only gbtruncatedgd <dig> was efficiently secreted in transiently transfected hek cells, as shown in figure 2b and c. although gbgd <dig> was well expressed, its secretion levels were very low. it was outside the scope of the present work to determine the reasons of the inability of gbgd <dig> to be efficiently secreted and gbgd <dig> was eliminated from the study.

the supernatants containing gbfc, gbtruncatedfc and gbtruncatedd <dig> were used in an in vitro neutralization assay  to verify if one of these secreted forms could successfully prevent bohv- <dig> attachment and penetration. the nta was performed on different cell lines , employing a recombinant bohv- <dig> expressing gfp   <cit> , at different temperatures , time of contact , number of seeded cells and amount of secreted peptides. bohv- <dig> attachment and penetration was monitored at different times  by gfp expression under fluorescence microscopy. no blocking activity was achieved with any of the experimental conditions tested . the secreted gb forms tested were apparently unable to prevent bohv- <dig> attachment and penetration and this was in contrast with that reported for some herpesvirus  <cit> , but in agreement with others  <cit> .


the inability of gbfc, gbtruncatedfc and gbtruncatedgd <dig> to prevent bohv- <dig> attachment and penetration of the host cell gave rise to several hypothesis: a) the folding of the secreted peptide could be improper; b) the amount of the secreted peptide could be insufficient; c) viral glycoproteins different from gb could be responsible for mediating virus-cell interaction and internalization, subordinating gb to a secondary role.

bohv-4-aΔgb was unable to replicate in host cells
therefore, it was of interest to investigate the above hypotheses through the disruption of the gb gene in bohv- <dig> genome. the bohv- <dig> gb orf was disrupted by site specific insertional mutagenesis mediated by heat inducible homologous recombination in a strain of bohv- <dig> genome cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome , pbac-bohv-4-a  <cit> .

a targeting cassette , excised from pgb-kanagalk-gb vector, containing the  <dig> bp kana/galk dna stuffer double selecting cassette  <cit> , flanked by two bohv- <dig> gb gene homology regions, was electroporated in sw <dig> e.coli containing pbac-bohv-4-a genome and pbac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk was generated . in the pbac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk genome, most of the gb orf has been replaced by kana/galk dna stuffer double selection cassette . all recombinant selected clones were shown to be authentic when analysed by pcr and sequencing , hindiii restriction enzyme digestion and southern hybridization . in order to obtain the revertant genome, pbac-bohv-4-a-gbrevertant, a large dna fragment obtained by pcr from the bohv-4-a genome, was electroporated in sw <dig> e.coli containing the pbac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk genome. following a double negative selection  <cit> , several revertant clones were obtained as showed by pcr, sequencing , hindiii restriction enzyme digestion and southern hybridization . the selected clones’ stability was assessed by serially passaging over  <dig> days and analysis by hindiii restriction enzyme digestion . to reconstitute infectious viruses, pbac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk and pbac-bohv-4-a-gbrevertant were electroporated into bek or bek/cre cells to excise the bac cassette. surprisingly, the viable virus was obtained only from pbac-bohv-4-a-gbrevertant but not from pbac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk, in both bek and bek/cre cells . the deletion of gb rendered bohv- <dig> unable to be reconstituted and productively replicated. bohv-4-a-gbrevertant growth characteristics were identical to the parental bohv-4-a .


vsvg could not complement bohv- <dig> gb
various attempts have been reported regarding gb complementation in several gammaherpesviruses using heterologous gb  <cit> . it was thus decided here to try to complement gb with vsvg, which has been previously shown to complement hsv- <dig> gb  <cit>  and which is also widely used to pseudo-type lentiviral vectors  <cit> .

bohv- <dig> gb orf was deleted as was done for pbac-bohv-4-aΔgb-kanagalk, in bohv-4-aΔl <dig> -vsvg . bohv-4-aΔl <dig> -vsvg is a replicating competent attenuated bohv- <dig> expressing vsvg, where the vsvg expression cassette is inserted into bohv- <dig> l <dig>  gene locus . when pbac-bohv-4-aΔl <dig> -vsvgΔgb-kanagalk was electroporated into bek or bek/cre it was unable to reconstitute replicating viral particles , as was observed for the deletion of gb from bohv-4-a. this is a further demonstration that bohv- <dig> gb is essential and cannot be complemented by a heterologous protein such as vsvg.

virus entry into host cells normally requires one glycoprotein involved in cell binding and membrane fusion, whereas herpesviruses use several viral glycoproteins to enter cells. herpesvirus entry relies on a complex multiprotein mechanism that is not yet well understood. even if the role of each single protein potentially involved is widely studied, their action as a complex, determining virus adhesion and cell entry has not been fully clarified.

gammaherpesviruses can infect different cell types in a cell-dependent manner, as is the case for hhv- <dig>  which is able to infect b cells through the action of the gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gb, gh and gl proteins, whereas it can infect epithelial cells only with gb, gh and gl  <cit> . in this complicated panorama, the role of gb is usually conserved with respect to virus adhesion and fusion to the host cells. indeed, a gb homologue has been identified in all gammaherpesviruses  <cit> .

in muhv- <dig>  gb and gh are required for cell fusion and the n-terminal half of gb is thought to be responsible for the fusion, containing a putative fusion loop. a change in ph drives the fusion and gb changes its state from a pre-fusion state to a post-fusion one. specific mabs directed against gb block membrane fusion, maintain gb in its post-fusion form, block the release of virions from late endosomes  <cit> , thus neutralizing infection. of the ten glycoproteins that have been described in bohv- <dig>  <cit> , gb is the most abundant and one of the major components of the virion. similarly to the majority of other gammaherpesviruses, like equine herpesvirus  <dig>  and  <dig>  and muhv- <dig>  bohv- <dig> gb is present in the virion in its cleaved form  <cit> . the bohv- <dig> orf <dig> coding for gb is  <dig> bp in length and has a strict homology with hhv- <dig> gb, indicating that these sequence similarities could correspond to similar secondary and tertiary structures  <cit> . bohv- <dig> gb transcript is unspliced and shows a typical tata box sequence positioned  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the first atg and a putative polyadenylation signal can be identified in 3′ respect to the stop codon. bohv- <dig> gb is an heterodimeric glycoprotein, called gp6-gp10-gp <dig>  with an apparent molecular size of  <dig> kda- <dig> kda- <dig> kda respectively. gp10-gp <dig> are linked by disulfide bonds and gp <dig> by non-covalent bonds and all these subunits derive from the proteolitical cleavage of the gb gene product  <cit> . bohv- <dig> gb interaction with heparan-like molecules present on host cell gags was previously shown  <cit> , demonstrating bohv- <dig> gb contribution to virus entry and fusion, but its direct necessity has not yet been demonstrated.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study may be considered the direct demonstration that gb is essential for bohv- <dig> replication and its deletion is not compatible with virus survival. moreover, despite the structural similarity between bohv- <dig> gb and vsvg proteins, gb substitution with vsvg is not effective, emphasising the unique and specific role of gb in bohv- <dig> life cycle.

figure s <dig>  a) overall strategy to reconstitute the orf <dig> complete gb locus, via heat inducible homologous recombination. the  <dig> bp gb locus, amplified by pcr , was introduced to replace the  <dig> bp kana-galk selectable dna stuffer, flanked by orf <dig> homologous regions in the bohv-4-a Δgbkanagalk strain cloned as a bac. the expected orf <dig> locus  has decreased size of the hindiii fragment , generated by hindiii restriction enzyme digestion . b) hindiii restriction profile and corresponding southern blotting of five representative targeted clones, compared to the untargeted control. southern blotting was performed with a probe spanning kana sequence and confirmed the above data. c) clonal stability of the pbac-bohv-4-a-Δgbrevertant in escherichia coli sw <dig> cells, passaged for  <dig> consecutive days and analyzed by hindiii digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis.
