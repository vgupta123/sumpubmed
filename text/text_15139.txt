BACKGROUND
the two avian coturnix species - japanese quail  and common quail  - belong to the order galliformes and to the family phasianidae, which also includes the chicken . the distributions of the two quail species overlap in the lake baikal region, to and from where wild quail migrate every year, toward asia for c. japonica and toward europe and africa for c. coturnix <cit> . however, hybridization is possible between the two species  <cit> , and hybrid males have a distinct crow  <cit> .

in asia, the japanese quail was domesticated for its singing abilities in the 15th century, and selected lines were developed in japan for egg production at the beginning of the 20th century  <cit> . japanese quail lines were then introduced successively in north america, europe and the near and middle east in the first half of the 20th century  <cit> . its small size, short generation interval, good laying abilities and ease of reproduction interested scientists looking for a bird easy to maintain and to experiment with in the laboratory, or willing to develop alternative ways of producing eggs and meat for human consumption  <cit> . however, for unknown reasons, the common quail was not domesticated. research on japanese quail has led to the development and use of commercial quail strains for meat and egg production in asia, europe and other parts of the world  <cit>  and to a better knowledge of its genetics  <cit> .

the first modern genetic tools developed specifically for quail analyses were panels of markers  <cit>  and genetic maps using aflp   <cit>  and microsatellites  <cit> . despite their limited extent, they have already been used extensively. at the population level, genome scans were carried out to detect qtl  for traits associated to fearfulness  <cit> , growth, egg production and duration of tonic immobility  <cit>  and egg laying curve  <cit> , and markers were used to discriminate the two species and their hybrids  <cit> . at the genome level, genes carrying causal mutations were found for plumage colours, like tyrp <dig> for the roux plumage  <cit>  and asip for the yellow  <cit>  and recessive black  <cit>  plumages. more recently, the existing quail maps were integrated and aligned to the assembled chicken sequence  <cit> , thereby confirming the high degree of synteny conservation expected because of the high level of chromosome homology observed between both species  <cit> , and the relevance of quail models for trait analyses in poultry.

further developments in quail genomics are held back by the small number of available markers which delay the search for other causal mutations. it is especially critical for traits with no known homologous phenotypes in chicken, like the rusty plumage colour and the curly-shaped feathers  <cit> , and for the fine mapping of qtl. our objective was to develop a dedicated quail snp  panel, in order to fine map a qtl for duration of tonic immobility. tonic immobility  is an innate fear-related behaviour which occurs throughout the animal kingdom  <cit>  and has been studied extensively in poultry . its duration  is considered to be a measure of fearfulness, representing an antipredatory behaviour. in birds, it is characterized by a strong motor inhibition, elicited by a brief period of physical restraint. the animal first struggles and attempts to escape, then gets immobile even after termination of restraint, and this freezing-like posture may last from a few seconds to several hours  <cit> . duration of tonic immobility is a quantitative polygenic trait with low to moderate heritability in poultry  <cit> . it has been successfully selected upwards and downwards in experimental quail lines over a large number of generations  <cit> . despite its adaptive nature, fear may have deleterious effects on domestic animal welfare and health  <cit> , and the relationship between duration of tonic immobility and productivity has been shown to vary from a positive to a negative one depending on the avian population and on the performance traits  <cit> .

deciphering the genetic architecture of tonic immobility will be challenging, as for other complex traits  <cit> . we first aim to fine map a qtl associated with dti previously mapped to quail chromosome  <dig> by using two f <dig> crosses between a japanese quail line selected for its long tonic immobility  and two lines with shorter tonic immobility, sti  and dd . to this end, two advanced intercross lines  were built. provided the density of information is sufficient, using advanced generations is expected to restrict the genome region involved in the variability of the trait  <cit> , with the ultimate objective to identify a causative gene. we chose to obtain a high number of snp directly from our quail populations by high-throughput sequencing  of two main types of reduced representations of the genome: restriction digested fractions of genomic dna, and est , extending a first experiment  <cit>  by increasing the number of sequences obtained and detecting reliable snp. a subset of these markers was selected to analyse the ail populations and to fine map the qtl.

RESULTS
sequence analyses and snp discovery
the sequences obtained in this study are available at ncbi .

despite the rapid reduction of sequencing costs, identifying snp by whole-genome sequencing of many individuals in a non-model species remains expensive, notably because the reliability of the identified snp depends on the sequence depth  <cit> . therefore, another approach was chosen  <cit>  and reduced representation libraries  were built: a genomic library with tagged samples  and a transcriptomic library .

aflp fragments were sequenced in one and a half run which produced  <dig> , <dig> reads, totalizing about  <dig> mb of sequence. reads were mapped to the chicken genome  to determine if the chicken genome coverage was compatible with our aim to select quail markers evenly distributed across the genome, through the use of the chicken sequence assembly. the average number of reads per chromosome is consistent with the chicken chromosome lengths, with the exception of the z chromosome, where more reads are observed than expected. this is probably due to the repetitive nature of a large part of the sequence of the z chromosome  <cit> . in total, 72% of the sequences mapped to the chicken genome. this result is comparable with that obtained in turkey, using a different alignment algorithm  <cit> , confirming the possibility to obtain satisfactory results from alignment of heterologous sequences on a reference genome assembly. this illustrates the fact that both species have a similar level of divergence  with the chicken  <cit> . except for some regions with high depth due to repetitive elements, the aflp coverage was uniform enough  to develop genome-wide snp assays with confidence, given the proximity of the chicken and quail genomes  <cit> .

from these data,  <dig>  reads  with identity tag and length higher than  <dig> bases were assembled into  <dig>  contigs , leaving  <dig>  singletons. in the absence of a reference quail genome sequence, the snp detection was performed from the obtained contigs. this led to the identification of  <dig>  snp.

regarding the snp type, a transition/transversion rate of  <dig> / <dig> was observed. this value is similar to those reported for chicken , duck , and slightly higher than that for the great tit   <cit> . overall, our results confirm that reduced representation libraries from aflp-derived fragments are successful tools for snp detection. they also have been effectively used for phylogeographic studies  <cit> .

in addition to the aflp library, a second reduced representation of the genome was obtained from brain and embryo transcripts. the brain transcriptome may reflect a higher part of the genome than other tissues  <cit> , and brain is probably the location of differential expression of behavioural genes between our quail lines. the embryo transcriptome was added to find snp in genomic regions not covered by the brain transcriptome.

as previously described  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  cdna reads have been obtained, of which  <dig>  filtered sequences were assembled into  <dig>  est contigs, with an average length of  <dig> bases  and an average depth of  <dig> , leaving  <dig>  singletons. among these  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   mapped to the chicken genome.

out of the  <dig>  contigs or singletons built from cdna data, 54% had significant matches  on swissprot, refseq_rna or refseq_protein databases. sequences with more than 50% coverage with an identity level higher than 70%  corresponded to  <dig>  unique referenced genes.

as already established for several species including brassica rapa, drosophila melanogaster or homo sapiens <cit> , the transition/transversion ratio is higher in coding sequences than in untranscribed regions, and the  <dig> : <dig> ratio in our est data versus  <dig> : <dig> from aflp data confirmed this assessment. snp were mainly discovered in non-coding region , and 30% of the observed snp in the coding region were non-synonymous snp, like in chicken  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  snp were detected:  <dig>  came from the genomic fragments while  <dig>  were identified from the cdna sequences,  <dig> of which being common between the two analyses based on their mapping on the chicken genome. snp with at least  <dig> bp of flanking sequence each side have been submitted to dbsnp. this panel constitutes the first genome-wide collection of snp markers for genetic studies in coturnix.

tonic immobility of ail
the distribution of dti was similar for the two ail populations . yet, the distribution for dd-lti was shifted slightly toward higher values of dti, and was therefore more affected by the censoring of dti at  <dig> sec. this difference probably reflects the distinct origin and history of selection of the two lines with lower dti, dd  and sti  which were used to start the two ail populations in crosses with line lti .

qtl analyses
as previous experiments had shown the presence of a suggestive qtl on quail chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , snp were selected from sequences mapping to the homologous chicken chromosome  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  snp selected from aflp and  <dig>  observed in cdna were obtained, and  <dig> snp putatively covering the entire quail chromosome  <dig> were chosen for genotyping. twenty-five of them, detected from quail cdna putatively homologous to several chicken genes, appeared to map on different chromosomes when considering their best localization . out of the  <dig> markers,  <dig>  gave reliable genotypes in our populations , and a total of  <dig>  were polymorphic. after testing for non deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium, respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers were used for further analyses.

a framework map of quail chromosome  <dig> was built, comprising  <dig> markers with an average number of informative meioses of  <dig> , for a genetic length of  <dig>  cm and with an average between-marker distance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm . the length of our genetic map is comparable to that  obtained previously for the same chromosome by kayang and coworkers  <cit> , but is shorter than the one  obtained in a backcross study  <cit> . several factors could explain this difference in length, like the structure of the populations and the number of individuals genotyped in each study, the type of markers used or the method employed to calculate the distance.

assuming quail and chicken chromosomes  <dig> have similar physical length, the relative coverage for our quail genetic map was  <dig>  cm/mb, which is much lower than the  <dig>  cm/mb ratio observed in chicken  <cit> . this result, probably partially related to the variability of recombination rates between populations, is consistent with the smaller number of chiasmata reported in quail lampbrush chromosomes  <cit> .

ail populations are expected to offer a very powerful tool to fine map qtl, especially when inbred lines are used as founders  <cit> , and the final ail generation is analyzed using classical qtl methods, taking advantage of the recombination events that have occurred over the course of multiple successive generations. we used this strategy with our lines to fine map a qtl previously detected in two distinct f <dig> crosses  <cit> . two ail populations were used: the ail_dd families based upon f <dig> crosses of dd and lti quail, and the ail_sti population resulting from f <dig> crosses between sti and lti birds.

first, qtl detection was applied within ail sire families by interval mapping with qtlmap  <cit> . unexpectedly, no qtl for dti could be detected in either of the final ail generations, even after performing a bulk analysis using the two ail populations. we suspected this result was the consequence of a lower detection power because the origin of alleles was not accounted for. indeed, recent ail studies included genotyping and phenotyping of all individuals in the ail line  <cit> , or were set up from at least one inbred line  <cit> , which made it possible to trace the origin of alleles back to the f <dig> lines. to overcome the problem, an association analysis was performed in our ail, with the assumption that enough power would be gained by adding information from dams within families of sires homozygous for the qtl, that were uninformative in the qtl mapping analysis based on familial linkage. this strategy was successful in the ail_dd population :  <dig> markers, in a genomic region orthologous to position  <dig> - <dig>  mb in chicken, showed a significant association with dti : fsiel0m02c8axd_ <dig>  fsiel0m02d00it_ <dig>  fsiel0m02c7rbx_ <dig>  and fsiel0m02dmfkd_ <dig> . non-significant markers encompassing the region were respectively at  <dig>   and  <dig>  mb . as the ail approach allows us to reasonably consider that linkage disequilibrium is limited, our investigation could be first restricted around this  <dig>  mb area. this result confirms the first mapping of a suggestive qtl in the original f <dig> population, as the region detected here belongs to the confidence interval estimated by the two-lod drop-off method  <cit>  from the original lti-dd qtl position  <cit> . the same region also contained a significant qtl in the original lti-sti f <dig> population  <cit> , but had not been previously shown to be associated with dti in chicken  <cit> .

the association study showed also that the most significant marker  had a substitution effect of  <dig>  phenotypic standard deviations and that only  <dig> f <dig> sires were heterozygous at the qtl. by using these estimates, the power of detection of the qtl in the ail_dd familial analysis was estimated to reach only 40%, which accounts for the fact that the qtl was not detected using this approach.

the same analysis in the ail_sti population did not reveal any significant association between dti and a marker. this may be due to the lack of linkage disequilibrium between the markers and the causative mutation in the sti population: whereas the most significant markers from the ail_dd were fixed in the dd line , the sti population showed allele sharing, indicating that a complete association between a putative fixed mutation and a snp marker could not be observed in the ail_sti. the facts that the ail were not phenotyped under the same setting  and that the genetic origins of the f <dig> were a same base line population for lti and sti, and a different unrelated one for dd  <cit>  may have also contributed to the diverging results of the association analyses.

most of the genes recorded in the investigated region have no known association with tonic immobility , with the notable exception of the dystrophin gene . in the candidate region, one gene  is involved in mental retardation or autism  <cit> ; structural variations including another gene  have been shown to be involved in mental disorders like autism  <cit> , but no clear connection could be made with tonic immobility. the  <dig> significant markers are included in  <dig> different genes : q5zlt <dig>  or pdk <dig> , a kinase involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, has been showed to be associated with drug resistance and colon cancer  <cit> ; eif2s <dig>  is a gene coding for a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig>  involved in protein synthesis by playing a role in translation start site selection ; klhl <dig>  encodes for a protein belonging to the kelch-like proteins family, implicated in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis mainly through cytoskeleton organization  <cit> ; all these three genes do not seem to have a function directly linked with the duration of tonic immobility. the fourth one, sat <dig> , catalyzing the acetylation of polyamines, has been associated with antineoplastic activity of several antitumor  <cit>  and is essential for the polyamine homeostasis . sat <dig> has been shown in transgenic mice to be involved in several behavioural traits as activity and spatial learning in females, but not in defensive reactivity  <cit> . it may constitute a correct candidate gene. but the dmd gene, localized between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, seems to be a very interesting one even if only the 3’end of the gene is included in the candidate region. sekiguchi et al.  <cit>  showed that dmd is involved in defensive behaviors in mouse, including a strong freezing response, reminiscent of the strong motor inhibition exhibited by quail in the tonic immobility response. this gene, well known for its implication in duchenne muscular dystrophy in human through mutations leading to loss-of-function of the gene products in striated muscles  <cit> , is also expressed in the brain, where it might account for the mental deficiency reported in duchenne muscular dystrophy patients . however, further work is needed to investigate the precise involvement of brain dystrophin in the control of emotions and cognition.

CONCLUSIONS
using japanese quail as an example, this work confirms the efficiency of aflp fragments as a reduced representation of the genome to develop snp markers for species for which no whole-genome draft sequence is available. transcript sequencing brings a high number of quail est that can be used to help annotate a future quail genome assembly. this study provides also a high number of japanese quail snp, for genetic analyses in coturnix. it underlines the importance of modern technologies as next generation sequencing in the renewed ability to perform association analyses, even in non-model species.

the association study carried out with a snp subpanel for chromosome  <dig> led to a candidate gene, dmd, as being partly responsible for the variability of tonic immobility in japanese quail. it should be the focus of further investigations to help unravel this complex trait.
