BACKGROUND
the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  poses a major challenge to healthcare. mrsa is a major cause of hospital-acquired infection throughout the world and is now also prevalent in the community as well as nursing and residential homes  <cit> . of the staph. aureus isolates in the united kingdom in  <dig>   <dig> % were found to be mrsa and a point prevalence survey showed that 16% of intensive care patients were either colonized or infected with mrsa  <cit> . mortality attributable to mrsa bacteraemia has been estimated to be 22%  <cit> . increasing reports of resistance to antibiotics and antiseptics, have sparked a wave of research to find alternative antimicrobial strategies  <cit> . one such strategy involves the use of light-activated antimicrobial agents  in photodynamic therapy   <cit> . following excitation of the laaa by light of an appropriate wavelength, singlet oxygen and free radicals are generated locally which directly attack the plasma membrane and other cellular targets resulting in bacteriolysis  <cit> . this could form the basis of an alternative approach for the eradication of such bacteria from superficial wounds, burns, varicose ulcers, pressure sores and carriage sites which are readily accessible to topical application of a laaa and light.

in vitro experiments with pdt have demonstrated effective bactericidal activity of toluidine blue o  and methylene blue  as photosensitisers against mrsa  <cit> . however, there are few in vivo studies which have looked at the effect of pdt in wounds, and in particular ones inoculated with drug-resistant bacteria. furthermore there are no reports of the use of pdt in wounds colonised by mrsa. two mouse studies that investigated the effect of pdt using a targeted polycationic photosensitiser demonstrated that pdt is effective at reducing the number of bacteria in excision wounds infected with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . this was also shown in a burn wound model infected with bioluminescent staphylococcus aureus treated with pdt using a cationic porphyrin  <cit> . however, within days of treatment, the bacterial luminescence reappeared, indicating incomplete bacterial killing.

a potential problem with pdt however, is its lack of specificity. its cytotoxic effect, which destroys bacteria so effectively, leads to delayed burn-wound healing, presumably as a result of the reactive oxygen species acting on host tissue  <cit> . pdt also resulted in delayed healing of wounds in rat skin grafts  <cit> . however, treatment of wounds with laser light alone shows more diverse findings. delayed wound healing was seen after delivery of high laser energy  in burn wounds  <cit>  in contrast to unchanged or even improved speed of recovery when lower light energy  is used  <cit> .

a further factor associated with red light illumination is the generation of heat. this is partly due to absorption of light by endogenous chromophores as well as release of energy by the excited photosensitiser in the form of heat rather than the actual pdt effect. as far as we are aware, no in vivo study has investigated the local heating effect associated with pdt treatment for microbial eradication using methylene blue.

the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of pdt, using methylene blue as a photosensitiser, on the survival of an epidemic strain of mrsa in excisional and superficial wounds in mice. the local heating effect associated with this pdt treatment was evaluated as well as the extent of collateral damage to host tissue.

RESULTS
effect of pdt on the number of viable bacteria in the wounds
figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the number of emrsa- <dig> isolated from the treated excision and superficial wounds and their respective control groups .

irradiation of the wounds in the presence of mb resulted in a significant reduction in the number of viable bacteria recovered from the wounds. this reduction was  <dig> fold  in the excision wounds and  <dig> fold  in the superficial scarified wounds.

effect of pdt on the temperature of the wounds
to study the effects of irradiation on wound temperature, two groups of animals were examined. one group received only laser irradiation with no mb  while the other group had full pdt treatment with mb and laser irradiation . the wound temperatures at the beginning of treatment were consistently lower than the core temperatures. the wound temperature in the animals treated with pdt rose by  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c and the maximum temperature achieved in this group was  <dig> °c . however, a smaller increase in temperature was noted in wounds irradiated with laser light in the absence of mb  with  <dig> °c being the highest temperature reached in this group.

histological findings following pdt
the cytotoxic effect of pdt on host tissue was examined in  <dig> biopsies from wounds treated with laser light and mb in combination. all exhibited a clear demarcation between wound and the skin and extended into adipose or loose areolar tissue on their deep aspect. some included fragments of the underlying skeletal muscle. in the area of the wound, the epidermis had been removed to leave either a thin layer of the underlying connective tissue overlying the panniculus adiposus, or a wound base of adipose tissue. in contrast, the adjacent tissue had retained its epidermis complete with appendages. none of the wounds examined showed evidence of extensive tissue necrosis.

normal wound architecture was seen in wounds that were sampled immediately after pdt . by  <dig> hours there was a heavy lymphocytic infiltrate, which in some sections extended quite deeply to involve the underlying muscle. this was very prominent at the wound edges but less marked towards the centre . when present in the latter areas, inflammatory cells could be seen infiltrating between dermal adipocytes. wounds examined at  <dig> hours in the presence of bacteria exhibited a similar pattern of inflammatory cell infiltration regardless of whether they were treated with laser light and mb, either alone or in combination . moderate to heavy bacterial deposits were observed in some wounds and were generally localised to areas with a heavy fibrin slough. observations were made on three biopsies for each experimental condition.

discussion
there are many reports in the literature of the ability of light-activated antimicrobial agents to kill a wide range of microbes in the laboratory  <cit> . in some of these in vitro investigations, attempts have been made to model the in vivo situation by using biofilms of the target organisms  <cit>  or by carrying out experiments in the presence of blood or serum. <cit>  in this study we have taken this further by investigating the ability of a laaa, methylene blue, to kill bacteria while present in a wound. our in vivo model reflects the early stages of an infectious process i.e. the initial colonisation of a wound by a potential disease-inducing organism. we used a strain of mrsa that is known to cause wound infections with significant clinical relevance, including fatal outcomes. the results of our study demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to reduce the number of viable mrsa present in a wound using the laaa methylene blue when activated by  <dig> j/cm <dig> of light  from a low power laser.

although substantial reductions in the viable count of mrsa in the wounds were achieved, the kills observed in this in vivo model were substantially lower than those reported in in vitro studies. hence, using light doses as low as  <dig> j/cm <dig>   <dig>  log <dig> reductions in the viable count of a suspension of mrsa  were obtained using the laaa toluidine blue o  at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml  <cit> . wainwright et al. also reported that methylene blue and toluidine blue o are extremely effective laaas against mrsa in vitro  <cit> . to our knowledge, only three papers have been published on the use of laaas to kill s. aureus in vivo  <cit> . each of these has used a different animal model and a different laaa which makes comparisons with the present study difficult. however, in all of these studies the bacterial kills reported were considerably lower than those that can be achieved in vitro. for example, when the laaa meso-mono-phenyl-tri-porphyrin  was used to kill s. aureus in burn wounds in mice, the kills achieved amounted to less than  <dig> log <dig> units using a light dose of  <dig> j/cm <dig>  <cit> . much greater kills were attained in vitro using a considerably lower light dose  and concentration of ptmpp . several factors may account for the reduced bactericidal effect observed in vivo including:  binding of the laaa to host material thereby reducing the effective dose and resulting in the generation of singlet oxygen in regions remote from the target bacteria,  absorption of laser light by laaa bound to host tissues – this would result in shielding of any laaa bound to bacteria preventing light activation and  quenching of singlet oxygen by host molecules thereby protecting bacteria from its harmful effects. some of these problems could be avoided, and hence greater kills achieved in vivo, by using a photosensitiser covalently linked to a bacterial targeting moiety  <cit> .

one aspect of the in vivo use of antimicrobial pdt that has not previously been investigated is the change in temperature of the host tissues accompanying the procedure. treatment of basal cell carcinoma with 5-aminolevulinic acid and red light  with a power density of  <dig> mw/cm <dig> resulted in a 8–10°c change in the surface temperature of the lesion  <cit> . in our study we found that irradiation with  <dig> j/cm <dig> of light in the presence of methylene blue resulted in a substantial rise in the wound temperature – the average maximum temperature at the centre of the wounds being  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c. however, it is very unlikely that such a temperature increase could account for the bacterial kills observed – s. aureus is able to grow at temperatures as high as 45°c  <cit> . furthermore, the decimal reduction time for the organism at a higher temperature of 50°c is of the order of  <dig> minutes whereas in the current study, the wound temperature was above 40°c for no longer than  <dig> minutes and did not reach 45°c  <cit> .

microscopic examination of biopsies immediately following treatment and after  <dig> hours did not reveal any tissue necrosis regardless of the experimental treatment applied. thus, at the  <dig> hour time point the use of pdt did not amplify the effect of the wounding.

this study has demonstrated that substantial kills of mrsa can be achieved in an in vivo mouse wound model using the laaa methylene blue, and without causing collateral damage to host tissues. these findings are significant for several reasons. they constitute the first report of the in vivo killing of mrsa using laaas. secondly, they support the small, but growing, number of in vivo studies demonstrating that pdt is an effective antimicrobial. thirdly, if such results can be reproduced in humans, the technique could be an effective means of preventing the colonisation of wounds by the organism and, possibly be used to eliminate mrsa from carriage sites such as the anterior nares. it should be noted that only a single application of pdt was used in this study and greater kills may be achieved through repeated application of the technique or by the "fractionation" of the light dose administered or in combination with other therapeutic agents such as antibiotics. we are currently investigating such modifications of the technique.

in this era of concern over the threat of the growing antibiotic resistance of pathogens such as mrsa to antibiotics, pdt offers an important advantage in that it is unlikely that the organism could develop resistance to this modality <cit> . another advantage of pdt is that, unlike the vast majority of antibiotics, it can also inactivate microbial virulence factors in addition to its microbicidal effect. hence, the biological activities of the proteases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis and the lipopolysaccharide of escherichia coli have all been shown to be reduced by irradiation in the presence of a laaa  <cit> . the future of laaas for the prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases looks promising following the recent report of the use of methylene blue to successfully treat periodontitis – one of the most prevalent infectious diseases of humans. <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that pdt using the light-activated antimicrobial agent, methylene blue, kills mrsa in superficial and deep excisional wounds in mice. however, killing is less effective than when performed in-vitro. this bactericidal effect was not due to the heat generated as a consequence of the treatment. histological examination of the wounds showed neither collateral tissue necrosis nor architectural disturbance.
