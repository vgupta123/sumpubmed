BACKGROUND
real-time pcr technology has recently reached a level of sensitivity, accuracy and practical simplicity allowing its use as a routine bioinstrumentation for pathogen detection, single nucleotide polymorphism and gene expression analysis  <cit> . in particular for the latter application, several controls are needed to ensure the integrity of each step along the process  <cit>  and therefore, to obtain reliable and accurate results. this process includes rna extraction , efficiency of the reverse transcription and pcr steps, amount of rna added into the reaction, etc. while the quantitative rt-pcr is technically robust, the normalization procedure to correct sample-to-sample variation remains a critical and challenging problem of this method  <cit> . several procedures have been suggested based on physical parameters, such as volume or cell number, but these methods are either impractical or unreliable due to the heterogeneity of biological samples. some authors favour an internal control strategy, which uses an alien rna molecule that is artificially incorporated into the biological sample  <cit> . as an example, liu & slininger proposed a set of universal external rna calibrators for microbial mrna expression analysis  <cit> . in spite of these initiatives, the most common practice is to normalize to either total rna amount, ribosomal rna or to a single internal reference gene termed housekeeping gene . several mathematical models have been developed that calculate the "relative" mrna expression changes of a target gene with respect to an hsk. the "2ΔΔct" approach  <cit>  is the most popular application in quantitative rt-pcr, but it assumes optimal and identical pcr efficiencies of target and reference genes. violation of this rule results in a systematic bias that either underestimates or overestimates the initial copy numbers. this problem can be bypassed by adjusting for pcr efficiency, which can be estimated using many approaches  <cit>  that can be separated into three groups  <cit> : serial dilutions, individual graph analysis based on the rate of fluorescence accumulation within the exponential region, or mathematical model fitting. whatever the method employed for determining the pcr efficiency, accurate relative quantification implies that the expression of the reference gene is perfectly stable in the sample set.

it is empirically assumed that housekeeping genes fulfil the criterion of unregulated expression independent of the experimental condition. however, some evidence shows that these genes are regulated to some extent, reinforcing the idea that there is no universal reference gene whose expression level remains constant whatever the conditions  <cit> . since even small variations of an internal control could lead to non-reliable expression data, it is critical to validate that the expression of reference genes is stable prior to their use for normalization in real time rt-pcr analysis. to overcome the "circular problem" of evaluating the expression stability of a candidate gene if no reliable measure is available to normalize the candidate  <cit> , vandesompele and colleagues  <cit>  developed a statistical algorithm termed genorm. their strategy relied on  a careful selection of a set of genes that display minimal variation across different biological conditions, and  normalization of the genes of interest to the geometric mean of a minimal, albeit optimal number of the selected genes. the strength of using geometric averaging is in smoothing the individual variation of the expression value of a single reference gene, which can lead to large errors of normalized data in samples of interest  <cit> . other statistical algorithms were also proposed, e.g. bestkeeper  <cit> , which allows including up to ten genes of interest in the analysis, or normfinder  <cit>  that is apparently less sensitive toward coregulation of the candidate reference genes.

real-time rt-pcr is commonly used to validate microarray-generated data  <cit> . act <dig> and rdn <dig> are among the most frequently used reference genes in s. cerevisiae studies, because the expression of these genes has been considered relatively stable under the conditions investigated. however, only two recent papers showed the stability of act <dig> expression and some other standard reference genes to normalize the expression of genes involved in central carbon metabolism during short-term glucose pulse  <cit> , or during the rehydration process in active dry yeast  <cit> . with the notable exception of these works, we could not find any study dedicated to the selection and validation of suitable reference genes in s. cerevisaie, contrary to other fungal models such as the pathogenic yeast candida albicans  <cit> , and the fungi metarhizium anisopliae  <cit>  and aspergillus niger  <cit> . therefore, the purpose of the present work was to identify a robust set of reference genes for growth phase-related mrna profiling in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. from public microarray datasets, we selected a set of potential reference genes that exhibited minimal variation among various conditions. the most stable subset of internal controls, which gave rise to a robust normalization factor, was then applied to quantify expression of genes involved in glycogen metabolism in response to changing growth conditions, and in a mutant defective in tps <dig> which encodes the trehalose-6p synthase subunit  <cit> .

RESULTS
sampling
cell samples were regularly harvested from the yeast cultures, and only samples from key physiological states were selected and used for mrna quantification by real time rt-pcr assays . these physiological states were defined from the macrokinetic growth parameters and reserve carbohydrates profiles as follows: the exponential - respiro fermentative- phase ; the diauxic shift , which corresponds to the time when the sugar has just been exhausted from the medium while glycogen shows a transient peak of accumulation; the post-diauxic or purely respiratory phase , which corresponds to the re-assimilation of fermentation products and to a second phase of glycogen accumulation; and finally, the stationary phase  when cells are starved for carbon nutrient. contrary to the wild type strain behaviour, the tps <dig> mutant significantly mobilized glycogen during the pds phase, and consequently more samples were taken up during this period to better characterize the physiological state of this mutant in this growth phase . in total, we carried out six independent yeast cultures . the wild type kt strain was grown on glucose  as the basic and reference growth condition  <cit> . it was also cultivated on galactose , which was used as the growth control condition for tps <dig> mutant since this mutant strain cannot grow on glucose  <cit> . finally, cultures on galactose of the cen.pk strain and the corresponding tps <dig> mutant were made in duplicates .

expression level and stability of candidate reference genes
as stated in the introduction, accurate normalization requires reference genes whose expression changes are negligible under the investigated conditions. candidate genes were therefore identified using public microarray datasets from de risi et al  <cit>  and gasch et al  <cit> , because the culture conditions reported in these studies were the closest to our experimental setup. we selected eight potential reference genes based on the stability of their expression during growth on glucose , taking care that these genes belong to different functional categories to minimize the risk of coregulation. the remaining genes listed in table  <dig>  i.e. act <dig>  pda <dig>  rdn <dig>  ipp <dig> and tdh <dig>  were also included in the list since they are traditionally used as single reference genes in expression studies by northern blots or real time rt-pcr.

function of candidate reference genes and gois as annotated in the sgd database . all orf sequences were recovered from the sgd database. forward  and reverse  primer sequences; pcr amplification efficiency . genes highlighted in bold were selected from their apparent stability during growth on glucose . the remaining reference genes are commonly used internal controls in yeast studies.

transcription profiling using real-time rt-pcr assays was then performed with these  <dig> candidate genes, in samples from the  <dig> cultures. we first analyzed transcript abundance of these genes in the different samples by direct comparison of their cycle threshold , assuming equal ct for equal transcript number since all rt-pcr reactions were performed with equal quantity of total rna. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  most of the selected genes presented ct values that spanned from  <dig> to  <dig> cycles, while ct values from rdn <dig> and tdh <dig> were clearly lower. for rdn <dig>  these values centered around  <dig> cycles with a very low dispersion. the glycolytic gene tdh <dig> was also highly expressed as indicated by ct values around  <dig> cycles, but it exhibited rather high dispersion over the growth phases and culture conditions as indicated by large whiskers of the box and many outliers. the ct of the remaining selected genes showed a reasonable dispersion, with expression levels of alg <dig>  kre <dig>  taf <dig>  tfc <dig> and ubc <dig> exhibiting smaller variation than that of act <dig>  hem <dig>  ipp <dig> or pda <dig> 

these raw ct data were then analyzed using genorm to identify the most suitable candidate genes. for each independent culture , or pool of several cultures , the  <dig> genes were ranked according to their gene expression stability measure "m" . all genes presented an m value below  <dig> , which is the default limit for acceptable expression stability as defined by vandesompele et al  <cit> . another advantage of genorm is to provide the optimal number of reference genes required for accurate normalization. this number is obtained by calculating the pairwise variation values ) between each combination of sequential normalization factors  . vandesompele and coworkers  <cit>  recommended a cut-off value at  <dig> , below which the inclusion of an additional gene does not result in a significant improvement of the normalization. according to this criterion, taf <dig> and ubc <dig> turned out to be sufficient as internal controls to normalize expression levels from samples taken from growth on glucose , whereas  <dig> genes were required for normalizing gene expression from the data sets f and g . according to the recommendation of vandesompele et al  <cit> , we always used a minimum of three of the most stably expressed genes to calculate the normalization factor. from this analysis, act <dig>  ipp <dig> and tdh <dig> were excluded from the set of selected genes for normalization as they always ranked among the worst candidates. in contrast, alg <dig>  taf <dig>  tfc <dig>  ubc <dig> and to a lesser extent kre <dig> turned out to be the most stable genes in the culture conditions tested in this study .

to further support this conclusion and the suitability of this set of genes to serve as a reference in a broader panel of experimental conditions, we examined gene stability of these candidate reference genes by using data from the entire microarray datasets from the sgd server , which altogether correspond to several hundred different experimental conditions. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  genes like alg <dig>  taf <dig>  tfc <dig>  ubc <dig> presented a significantly higher number of experiments with a log <dig> ratio close to zero as compared to act <dig>  this microarray survey analysis indicated that our initially selected genes exhibited very little expression change over a wide range of experimental conditions. therefore, this set of genes, alg <dig>  taf <dig>  tfc <dig> and ubc <dig> should be preferentially used to calculate normalization factors in quantitative rt-pcr expression analysis in the yeast s. cerevisiae.

impact of reference gene selection on expression ratio values
the strength of genorm to select the most suitable reference genes was demonstrated by comparing normalized data calculated from different subsets of potential hsks. as is shown in figure  <dig>  the use of a normalization factor based on the geometric mean of expression levels of ubc <dig>  taf <dig> and alg <dig> ) yielded expected expression patterns of the glycogen metabolic genes gsy <dig> and gph <dig> during growth of the kt strain on glucose . ratios of expression values were almost identical using the following  <dig> best genes based on genorm classification , compare grey and hatched bars) or applying the normalization factor calculated from the six best genes together , not plotted). these results showed that, at least in this condition, any subset of three genes among the most stably expressed candidates was sufficient to calculate robust nf and to normalize expression of genes of interest .

the advantage of using validated genes for normalization was further analyzed comparing expression results after normalization , etc) to those obtained by using non-validated reference genes, e.g. act <dig> ) or a combination of act <dig>  pda <dig> and ipp <dig> ). as it could be expected from the coregulation of these three genes during growth on glucose , identical expression data were obtained with nf and nf as normalization factors . in contrast, a strong discrepancy between normalization to act <dig> and normalization to validated genes was observed in biological samples collected in the post-diauxic phase  and in the stationary phase . this strong deviation could be explained by the drop of act <dig> mrna as well as that of transcripts of other hsk genes  during these growth phases . to better visualize the advantage of using normalization to validated genes, data from sample set b were reported on a scatter plot , comparing data normalized to nf and nf, respectively, to those normalized to nf . a regression coefficient close to one  was calculated for nf versus nf. in contrast, the coefficient was extremely low for nf versus nf , mainly due to expression data from pds and sp samples.

similar analyses were carried out by using different biological situations, as for instance, in a biological set combining samples from cultures on glucose and galactose to analyze the influence of the carbon source , or from wild type and tps <dig> mutants to analyze the impact of the mutation on the expression data . again, discrepancies in ratios of expression values calculated by normalization to the "best reference genes" and to act <dig>  respectively, were evident in samples collected from yeast cultures entering the diauxic shift. the difference was even more pronounced with late stationary phase samples, as the difference could reach almost 10-fold between the two procedures . this discrepancy was visualized in the scatter plots presented in figure  <dig>  which report a larger range of ratio values than those in figures  <dig> & <dig>  as expected, data from ) versus ) aligned with a good regression coefficient , while nf did not correlate at all with nf as shown by the worst regression coefficient of the study . altogether, these results demonstrated the benefit of using multiple selected genes instead of a single, non-validated gene  for accurate and reliable data normalization.

application to quantitative expression analysis of genes involved in glycogen metabolism
to test the robustness of this subset of selected reference genes, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in glycogen metabolism in this yeast. it has been reported that large variations of reserve carbohydrate content are associated with coordinated transcriptional regulation of the cognate genes in response to changing growth conditions or under various genetic contexts  <cit> . when examining raw ct values from gph <dig>  and gsy <dig>  in the complete dataset , the very long whiskers of the boxes and numerous outliers confirmed the high variability of the expression of these two genes. on the contrary, the sga <dig> gene encoding the vacuolar amylo- <dig>  - <dig>  glucosidase  <cit>  exhibited much lower dispersion of ct values, indicating smaller expression change than gsy <dig> and gph <dig> under our growth conditions. using the  <dig> best reference genes for data normalization ), we confirmed the induction of gsy <dig> and gph <dig> between the exponential phase  and the entry into the diauxic shift , and found remarkable expression ratios close to  <dig> for gsy <dig> and almost  <dig> for gph <dig> . moreover, this normalization procedure allowed us to show that the expression of these two genes dropped immediately after the diauxic shift, to return to the initial level in stationary phase for gsy <dig>  or close to it for gph <dig>  while act <dig> normalization indicated stable and high expression of these two genes all along these growth phases. in contrast to gsy <dig> and gph <dig>  the expression of sga <dig> showed a modest increase when cells entered the diauxic shift to reach a 3-fold activation in the stationary phase. we also analyzed for the first time transcriptional patterns in galactose-grown cells . unexpectedly, the expression of gph <dig> and gsy <dig> was already very high in the exponential phase  as compared to cultures on glucose , and it did not further increase as cells entered the diauxic shift on this carbon source, whereas glycogen accumulated with a kinetic almost similar to that on glucose . the expression of these two genes then dropped during the post diauxic phase to reach levels even lower than on glucose in the stationary phase. in contrast to gph <dig> and gsy <dig>  sga <dig> expression was not affected by the carbon source. finally, expression patterns of these three genes on galactose were the same in the cen.pk genetic background  as in the kt strain .

the loss of tps <dig> function had a strong impact on the glycogen accumulation pattern on galactose, as it caused hyper-accumulation of the polymer at the end of the exponential phase, and also promoted its rapid and sustained degradation during post-diauxic and stationary phases . therefore, to get a preliminary idea on how this mutation could alter the glycogen kinetics at the transcriptional level, we quantified the expression of gsy <dig>  gph <dig> and sga <dig> during growth on galactose of the wt and its tps <dig> derivative strain. it is shown in figure  <dig> that the expression pattern of gph <dig> or gsy <dig> was identical in both the wild type and in the mutant strains. the only noticeable difference was for sga <dig> gene whose expression was already increased in the exponential phase in a tps <dig> mutant  as compared to the wild type strain .

discussion
in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the microarray datasets available on the saccharomyces genome database website now represent a vast treasure-trove of reference genes suitable for gene expression normalization. we therefore used the gene expression connection tool  <cit>  to search for a set of stably expressed genes in growth dynamics  <cit> . other approaches have recently been proposed for selection of internal controls, with statistical analysis of large microarray datasets  <cit> . nevertheless, as stated by the authors  <cit> , these in silico searches for stable internal controls must be accompanied by lab-bench work to verify that selected candidate genes are reliable for normalization in a specific experimental context. this is what we actually performed in the present work. out of  <dig> genes analyzed in this study, i.e.  <dig> functionally unrelated genes selected from the microarray datasets together with  <dig> standard reference genes , we identified alg <dig>  taf <dig>  tfc <dig>  ubc <dig> and to a lesser extent kre <dig>  as the most stable genes in our experimental conditions. another very important result from this study was the observation that geometric averaging of any subset of three genes among the six most stable genes led to very similar normalization factors, therefore highlighting the robustness of our gene selection. this conclusion was further supported by the weak expression change of this subset of genes as revealed by a survey of microarray datasets from the sgd server, i.e. in approximately  <dig> large scale transcriptomic studies, which altogether correspond to several hundreds of different samples. therefore, alg <dig>  taf <dig>  tfc <dig> and ubc <dig> genes are the most pertinent reference genes, not only for growth phase related mrna profiling in s. cerevisiae, but more generally for quantitative gene expression analysis with samples that cover a large panel of physiological and metabolic states.

probably because of the tedious experimental validation of a suitable set of reference genes, the common practice by many authors was to use act <dig>  pda <dig>  tdh <dig> or rdn <dig> as a single reference gene for normalization in s. cerevisiae expression studies, assuming a steady state level of expression for these so-called housekeeping genes. however, the validity of act <dig> as an internal standard has been already questioned  <cit>  and pda <dig> was preferred to act <dig> for normalization in northern blot analysis since stationary phase samples showed a more significant drop of act <dig> mrna. still, by the use of northern blot analysis, it was indeed demonstrated that act <dig> is a representative gene whose transcription is typically repressed following the shift from logarithmic growth to stationary phase  <cit> . as preliminary molecular clues on how down regulation of this gene occurs, these authors showed that topoisomerase i has a regulatory role in the transcriptional repression of most of the genes following the diauxic shift and in the stationary phase  <cit> . the second work reported a major role of the rna polymerase ii subunit rpb <dig>  which permitted appropriate transcriptional responses during stress, including nutrient stress that accompanies entry into stationary phase  <cit> . global transcriptome analysis  <cit>  also showed that act <dig> mrna levels did decrease significantly during growth in a glucose rich medium, a pattern that was confirmed by using absolute quantification by real time rt-pcr  <cit> . in our study, using the geometric averaging of multiple selected reference genes for relative quantification, we also found a significant drop of act <dig> transcripts and of other frequently used genes like pda <dig>  and ipp <dig>  when cells proceed from the exponential phase of growth to the stationary phase. therefore, as already mentioned by monje-cajas et al  <cit> , the use of act <dig> and related transcripts would seriously over-estimate  expression levels of genes of interest in stationary phase, leading to erroneous conclusions. moreover, the genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, for example tdh <dig> , were amongst the first yeast genes to be isolated. because of their high expression levels, their promoters have been widely used to construct yeast expression vectors  <cit>  and as model systems to study transcription  <cit> . nevertheless, as details of the organisation of glycolytic promoters have emerged, it has become clear that these "simple housekeeping genes" actually have sophisticated molecular mechanisms controlling their expression  <cit> . as reviewed in this latter reference, some glycolytic enzymes were induced by glucose while others such as eno <dig> and tdh <dig> appeared to be constitutively expressed irrespective of the carbon source . our results, i.e. the large dispersion of ct values from tdh <dig> in our experimental conditions  and the fact that this gene ranked amongst the worst candidate reference genes , somehow contradicted this conclusion and do not encourage the use of tdh <dig> as a constitutive, internal reference gene for reliable gene normalization. finally, the gene rdn <dig> encoding the 18srrna could have been accepted for normalization, but the very strong expression that is several orders of magnitude above the mean expression of tested reference genes and gois, together with the fact that rdn <dig> does not encode mrna precluded its use as an internal reference gene.

as an application of this normalization procedure with carefully selected reference genes, we reinvestigated in a quantitative manner the transcriptional response of genes implicated in glycogen metabolism, since this physiological event is an interesting hallmark during long term yeast cultures with significant transcriptional remodeling and huge variations of the polysaccharide content  <cit> . this study confirmed known transcriptional induction patterns of genes encoding glycogen phosphorylase  and glycogen synthase  that paralleled the accumulation of glycogen between the exponential phase and the diauxic shift on glucose  <cit> , with a notable induction ratio of approx. 100-fold for gph <dig> and 20-fold for gsy <dig>  for the first time, this study also provided expression data of these genes on galactose. despite similar growth pattern and glycogen accumulation kinetic as compared to glucose, the growth on galactose radically changed the expression pattern of these two genes. transcripts levels were already very high in the exponential phase as compared to glucose, and we could not observe any upregulation at the entry into the diauxic-shift. therefore, the glycogen accumulation that was observed at the end of the exponential phase during growth on galactose probably came from a concomitant activation of gsy2p and the inactivation of gph1p by protein phosphatases mediated dephosphorylation events  <cit> . with respect to the vacuolar amylo-glucosidase , the large-scale transcriptional study from gash and co-workers showed some transcriptional activation of this gene during long term yeast cultures on glucose  <cit> . wang and co-workers  <cit>  also provided indirect evidence of transcriptional activation of sga <dig> in stationary phase, showing a significant role of sga <dig> gene deletion on glycogen accumulation pattern in this phase of growth. their result suggested that sga <dig> may not be strictly sporulation specific, but could be activated under starvation, like in the late stationary phase. our study supported this assertion and showed that the expression of sga <dig> increased during the post-diauxic growth, with maximal 3-fold activation in stationary phase in wild type strains. on the other hand, the causal relationship between higher expression of sga <dig> and faster glycogen degradation in tps <dig> derivative strains as compared to the wt remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
a set of putative internal control genes for real-time rt-pcr analysis was selected from public microarray datasets. using genorm software, we validated that alg <dig>  taf <dig>  tfc <dig>  ubc <dig> and to a lesser extent kre <dig>  turned out to be the most stable genes under all conditions investigated. geometric averaging of their expression data was then applied to smooth individual variation and to calculate robust normalization factors, which allowed for the demonstration that the use of a single reference gene like act <dig> could lead to erroneous expression data. this set of reference genes was carefully tested in a context of large heterogeneity of samples  and applied to explore quantitatively the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in glycogen metabolism in this yeast. this study brought new insights into the transcriptional control of gsy <dig>  gph <dig> and sga <dig> during long term growth on glucose and galactose, suggesting a potential role of sga <dig> in the management of glycogen storage in tps <dig> cells. to summarize, this work provides a set of pertinent reference genes that should be used for validation of expression data from microarrays experiments and more generally for reliable real time rt- pcr analysis in yeast.
