BACKGROUND
wallerian degeneration , the degeneration of the axon distal to a site of transaction, occurs in both axons and myelin after injury to the peripheral nervous system  . the pns, unlike the central nervous system , is capable of regeneration after an injury that causes wd processes to begin  <cit> . a number of studies have found that nerve injury not only plays a key role in modulating the activities of schwann cells but also promotes axonal regeneration by releasing a large number of regeneration-related factors, including cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines . therefore, it is important to elucidate the key factors involved in regulating the degeneration and regeneration that occurs in the pns after injury . the molecular mechanisms regulating wd are not yet completely understood, but understanding the factors that regulate rapid responses during wd may reveal the mechanisms underpinning nerve repair and regeneration .

secreted phosphoprotein  <dig>  belongs to the family of secreted acidic proteins. it has a large number of consensus sequence sites and multiple phosphorylation sites and binds to several integrin receptors, which have been well established to function in cell adhesion, migration, and survival  <cit> . spp <dig> is expressed in a range of immune cells and reported to act as an immune modulator, which promotes cell recruitment to inflammatory sites  <cit> . it also functions as an adhesion protein involved in cell attachment and wound healing  <cit> . stimulation of spp <dig> expression leads to an increase in cell pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, although the regulatory pathways are not yet known .

we previously reported on gene expression signal flow and pathways regulated by key factors as determined by microarray analyses, such as claudins, transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  spp <dig>  and toll-like receptor  <dig>  during the processes of wd after rat sciatic nerve injury . here, we examined the effect of spp <dig> on cytokine release, cell apoptosis, cell migration and proliferation, and signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo.

animal model
male sprague–dawley rats  were provided by the experimental animal center of nantong university. the rats were randomly divided into eight groups  and underwent sciatic neurectomy. all animal tests were conducted in accordance with the us national institutes of health’s guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and by the key laboratory of neuroregeneration guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. the institutional animal care and use committee of nantong university approved all protocols used in this study.

the rats were anesthetized using an injection of complex narcotics , and the sciatic nerve was identified and lifted through an incision on the lateral aspect of the mid-thigh of the right hind limb. the sciatic nerve was cut, and a 1-cm segment was excised. one group of rats was immediately used in experiments , and the other groups were used  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h as well as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 4 weeks after the surgery. the 0-h animals received sham operations.

primary culture of schwann cells
the rats for this experiment were provided by the experimental animal center of nantong university. the rats were sacrificed, and schwann cells  were isolated from the sciatic nerves. the scs were treated with anti-thy <dig>  antibody  and rabbit complement  to remove fibroblasts as previously described  <cit> . scs were cultured from the sciatic nerves of 1-day-old sprague–dawley rats as previously described  <cit> . primary cultures of schwann cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °c in a humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere.

spp <dig> sirna transfection of schwann cells
three different small interfering rnas   were used to perform rna interference. scs were transfected with spp <dig> sirnas  using lipofectamine rnai max transfection reagent  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. black control that raised normally and nc-sirna were tested. the sirna- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> transfection experiments were repeated three times.table  <dig> spp <dig> sirna primers




overexpression of spp <dig> in schwann cells
scs were cultured in dmem  with 100 iu/ml penicillin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 g/ml streptomycin at 37 °c and 5% co <dig>  the scs were identified by examining the immunofluorescence of an antibody to the marker s <dig>  and the final cells were found to comprise 98% scs. the spp <dig> overexpression plasmid pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> was constructed as previously described  <cit> . a mixture of pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid and x-treme gene hp dna transfection reagent , or x-treme gene hp dna transfection reagent and an empty vector were then transfected into scs for 48 h. after that, real-time quantitative pcr and western blot analyses were conducted. the pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> overexpression experiments were repeated three times.

real-time quantitative pcr analysis
total rna was extracted with trizol regent, and cdna was synthesized with a cdna reverse transcription kit . real-time qpcr was performed using a  <dig> real-time pcr system according to the manufacturer’s protocols. the analysis was repeated three times, and the reactions were conducted in triplicate. the comparative ct method was used to analyze the cycle threshold  values. the data were analyzed, and group differences were considered statistically significant at values of p less than  <dig> .

western blot analysis
injured nerve samples and scs were homogenized in protein lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. the protein expression levels were analyzed using antibodies against anti-spp <dig>  akt, phosphorylated -akt, protein kinase c-alpha , c-fos, extracellular signal-regulated kinase , and p-erk. the western blot images were scanned with a gs <dig> densitometer scanner , and the optical density data were analyzed using pdquest  <dig> . <dig> software. gapdh was used as a reference to normalize the levels of protein. the data were analyzed, and group differences were considered statistically significant at values of p less than  <dig> . all injured nerve samples were analyzed in three independent experiments.

flow cytometry analysis
the extent of sc apoptosis was measured using an annexin v-fitc apoptosis detection kit  as described by the manufacturer’s instructions. scs were washed with pbs and then collected for flow cytometry analysis. fitc-labeled annexin v  in binding buffer  was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. the incubation was continued with 10 μl of propidium iodide for 10 min on ice in the dark. after that, the apoptotic cells were measured by facscan flow cytometry.

cell proliferation assay
cultured scs were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml onto  <dig> % poly-l-lysine-coated plates. cell proliferation was assayed at 2 days after cell transfection. edu  was added to the cell culture and incubated for 2 h. the scs were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. after sc labeling, a cell-light edu dna cell proliferation kit  was used to analyze cell proliferation according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cell proliferation was expressed as the ratio of edu-positive cells, which was defined by images of randomly selected fields obtained on a dmr fluorescence microscope . the cell proliferation assays were performed three times using triplicate wells.

cell migration assay
transwell chambers  with 8-µm pores were used to examine sc migration as described previously  <cit> . scs  resuspended in 100 µl of dmem were transferred to the top chamber and allowed to migrate in 5% co <dig> into the lower chamber before the addition of 600 µl complete medium. cells adhering to the bottom surface of each membrane were stained with  <dig> % crystal violet, imaged, and counted using a dmr inverted microscope . the cell migration assays were conducted three times using triplicate wells.

spp <dig> knockdown and overexpression in transfected scs alters mrna expression levels
we synthesized three specific spp <dig> sirnas—sirna- <dig>  sirna- <dig> and sirna-3—and all three were found to reduce spp <dig> mrna expression levels. the interference transfection efficiencies of two of the sirna fragments were at least 80% ; thus, we selected the most efficient one, sirna- <dig> , for the following experiment. to investigate the potential functions of spp <dig> in scs, including on cytokine release, we analyzed the mrna levels of the pro-apoptotic factors b-cell lymphoma  <dig>  and bcl-2-associated x protein  as well as neurofibromin  <dig> , neurotrophin  <dig>  and pkcα after spp <dig> knockdown and overexpression in transfected scs. our real-time qpcr results showed that bax, bcl <dig>  nf <dig> and pkcα mrna expression levels were downregulated in scs with spp <dig> knocked down and upregulated by spp <dig> overexpression in scs. by contrast, the expression of nt <dig> mrna was upregulated by spp <dig> knockdown and downregulated by spp <dig> overexpression in scs  . these data indicated that the differential expression of spp <dig> alters mrna expression levels in scs.fig.  <dig> cytokine expression in sc spp <dig> knockdown and overexpression. a spp <dig> sirna- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> transfection efficiency assay . b real-time qpcr analysis of bax, bcl <dig>  nf <dig>  nt <dig>  and pkcα mrna expression levels after spp <dig> sirna- <dig> transfection of scs for 2 days. gapdh was used to normalize values to the negative control . the average of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± sem. c real-time qpcr analysis of bax, bcl <dig>  nf <dig>  nt <dig>  and pkcα mrna expression levels after pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid transfection of scs for 2 days, using gapdh to normalize data to the negative control . the average of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± sem




spp <dig> affects c-fos, pkcα, and erk signaling pathways in vitro
as shown above, altered spp <dig> expression resulted in changes in mrna expression levels that could affect cytokines. we next examined whether spp <dig> affected signaling pathways in vitro using cultured scs. protein expression levels of c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk were compared with those in negative control scs using western blot analysis. we found that protein levels of c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk were significantly changed after transfection of spp <dig> sirna and the pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid , indicating that c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk signaling pathways could be activated by spp <dig> . thus, spp <dig> may play roles in regulating c-fos, pkcα, and p-erk/erk signaling pathways in cultured scs in vitro.fig.  <dig> expression of c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk protein levels in sc spp <dig> knockdown and overexpression. a western blot analysis of c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk expression after spp <dig> sirna- <dig> transfection of scs for 2 days, using gapdh to normalize data to negative controls. the average of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± sem. b–d relative protein expression levels of c-fos, pkcα, and p-erk/erk as determined by western blot analysis. e western blot analysis of c-fos, pkcα, and p-erk/erk expression after pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid transfection of scs for 2 days, using gapdh to normalize data to negative controls. the average of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± sem. f–h relative protein expression levels of c-fos, pkcα, and p-erk/erk as determined by western blot analysis




spp <dig> affects sc apoptosis, proliferation, and migration in vitro
to determine the function of spp <dig> in scs, primary scs were transfected with spp <dig> sirna, pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid, or negative control vector, and the effects of these transfections on cell apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of scs were examined in vitro. compared with that in negative controls, the apoptosis rate of scs transfected with spp <dig> sirna was increased  and that of scs transfected with pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> was decreased  , suggesting that silencing spp <dig> induced sc apoptosis, whereas enhancing spp <dig> expression reduced sc apoptosis. the results of our edu-based proliferation assay indicated that compared with the proliferation rate of scs in negative controls, that of scs transfected with spp <dig> sirna was decreased , whereas that of scs transfected with the pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid was increased  . we also found that the migration rate of scs transfected with spp <dig> sirna was increased , whereas that of scs transfected with the pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid was decreased  as compared with that of the negative control  . these results indicated that the expression of spp <dig> affects sc apoptosis, proliferation, and migration in vitro.fig.  <dig> spp <dig> knockdown and overexpression affect sc apoptosis. a, b silencing spp <dig> by transfection with spp <dig> sirna significantly induces apoptosis of scs compared with that in negative controls . c, d overexpression of spp <dig> in scs by transfection with the pcdna <dig> -spp <dig> plasmid significantly inhibits sc apoptosis compared with that in ncs. e relative numbers of scs with the spp <dig> knockdown. f relative numbers of scs overexpressing spp <dig>  the average of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± sem

to determine the effect of spp <dig> on wd after rat sciatic nerve injury in vivo, we examined the functions of spp <dig> on rat sciatic nerve repair and regeneration  <dig> and 2 weeks after injury. after exposing the injured sciatic nerves to either spp <dig> sirna or the negative control vector for  <dig> or 2 weeks, we conducted real-time qpcr and western blot analyses. our results indicated that altered spp <dig> expression affected the mrna and protein expression levels of the cytokines bax, bcl <dig>  nt <dig>  and early growth response  <dig>  as well as of pkcα and differentially regulated the c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk signaling pathways  . these results were consistent with the functions of spp <dig> observed in vitro.fig.  <dig> altered spp <dig> expression affects cytokine expression and c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk pathways in vivo. a real-time qpcr analysis of spp <dig>  bax, bcl <dig>  nt <dig>  pkcα and egr <dig> expression levels after exposure of injured rat sciatic nerves to spp <dig> sirna- <dig> for  <dig> and 2 weeks. gapdh levels were used as a control . the average of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± sem. b western blot analysis of spp <dig>  c-fos, p-erk/erk, and pkcα protein expression levels after injured rat sciatic nerves were exposed to spp <dig> sirna- <dig> for  <dig> and 2 weeks. gapdh levels were used as a control . c–f relative protein expression levels of spp <dig>  c-fos, p-erk/erk, and pkcα as determined by western blot analysis. the average of three independent experiments is shown as mean ± sem 




discussion
peripheral nerve injury and repair is a result of reactivated regeneration mechanisms in combination with newly activated injury-dependent reactions. our data indicated that gene and protein expression changes after sciatic nerve injury appeared to provide separate signals that were characterized by a high degree of overlapping genes . these signals are thought to recruit neutrophils and may amplify proinflammatory cytokine responses via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/nuclear factor-kappa b pathway to activate the processes of nerve injury, repair, and regeneration .

in the present study, we determined the effect of spp <dig> on nerve repair and rejuvenation after sciatic nerve injury in vitro and vivo. spp <dig> has been described as a component of the inflammatory environment of dystrophic and injured tissues  <cit> . different cell types may differ in their regulatory mechanisms of the spp <dig> gene. although spp <dig> is also important for the migration of neutrophils in vitro , regulation of the spp <dig> gene is incompletely understood. our results indicated that spp <dig> mediates cell activation and cytokine production after sciatic nerve injury. in addition, spp <dig> may act as an important anti-apoptotic factor and may prevent non-programmed cell death in inflammatory colitis. spp <dig> was previously shown to act as a macrophage chemotactic factor and play an important role in mast cell migration  <cit> . here, we reported the functions of spp <dig> in the injured sciatic nerve during wd. stimulation of spp <dig> expression resulted in cytokine expression changes and may regulate c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk pathways in vitro. altered spp <dig> expression was also shown to affect sc proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. we also verified these data in vivo. further studies will be necessary to identify the key regulatory factors, how they regulate signaling pathways in vivo, and their functions during wd after peripheral nerve injury.

CONCLUSIONS
spp <dig> is differentially expressed during wd after rat sciatic nerve injury. in vitro and vivo analyses revealed that spp <dig> is a key regulatory factor that affects nerve degeneration and regeneration through c-fos, pkcα, and p-erk/erk pathways after rat sciatic nerve injury. we concluded that spp <dig> plays important roles in peripheral nerve injury, repair, and regeneration.
