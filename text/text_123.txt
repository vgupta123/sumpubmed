BACKGROUND
several different algorithms for detection of periodically expressed genes in dna microarray temporal profiles have been proposed  <cit> . theoretical and algorithmic foundations for the detection algorithms include for example fourier analysis  <cit> , spline modelling  <cit> , single-pulse models  <cit> , and partial least squares classification  <cit> . one group of algorithms, including those in  <cit> , use supervised learning methods  <cit>  that exploit labelled expression profiles of genes known to be periodically expressed in the experiment to find other genes that also are periodic. this supervised learning approach precludes many potential applications where labelled training examples are not available e.g. for poorly characterised organisms.

in the subgroup of recently proposed learning-free algorithms which do not rely on supervised learning, prior knowledge in the form of a known angular frequency ω is presumed. for example, in  <cit>  the power  of frequency ω in the expression profile fourier spectrum is used in creating a score for detection. however, since the period time usually is not exactly known, a novel method was proposed in  <cit>  to resolve this problem by employing fisher's g-test  <cit>  for detection of periodic temporal profiles. this approach seems attractive but is designed to detect any periodic temporal profile, even if its period differs significantly from the period of the cell-cycle. in other words, it does not use any prior knowledge about the period time.

the algorithm used in the work by spellman et al.   <cit>  partly utilises prior knowledge about the cell-cycle period. this is achieved by averaging the power of fourier spectrum frequencies across a discrete set of frequencies over a frequency interval that is thought to encompass the true frequency . the detector test statistic is modulated by the pearson correlations between the present temporal profile and a set of labelled temporal profiles for genes known to be periodically expressed. thus, the algorithm belongs to the subgroup of supervised methods.

the performance of various algorithms used for detection of cell-cycle genes, i.e. genes regulated by and/or regulating the cell-cycle, were recently compared by de lichtenberg et al.   <cit> . importantly, one should remember that not all genes, required for the cell-cycle are periodically expressed. one example is cdc <dig> kinase whose activity is phase specific but regulated by the cyclins on the protein level  <cit> . moreover, there are many periodically expressed genes that are not part of the cell-cycle machinery. for example, the gene encoding the cell wall mannoprotein tir <dig>  is known to be periodically expressed . in the gene ontology  <cit>  tir <dig> is annotated to the biological process of stress-response, but not to any annotation linked to the cell cycle. with this in mind, inferred periodic expression from temporal patterns of mrna expression may be used to study to what degree cell-cycle genes are periodically expressed, but it is not expected that a detector for periodic expression will recover all cell-cycle genes.

any detector for periodic transcription transforms the expression time profile into a real number, the test statistic, which is used to make a decision or to rank the genes. the sensitivity and specificity of the detector thus depends on the particular test statistic threshold employed and should therefore be evaluated for all relevant threshold settings in a receiver operating characteristic  analysis. the roc is usually displayed in the form of a curve that shows the probability of detection as a function of the probability of false alarm for all possible values of the threshold  <cit> . due to the small number of labelled temporal gene expression profiles presently available, it is not possible to perform reliable evaluation of the performance of the detectors on real biological data. for budding yeast s. cerevisiae there are compilations of genes known to be periodically expressed during the cell-cycle  <cit>  but there are no compilations of genes known to be non-periodic. thus, using the few genes known to be periodically expressed, a rough estimate of the probability of detection can be obtained for any threshold value but there will be no estimates at all of the probability of false alarm.

in addition to the lack of labelled data for performance validation, another difficulty is that a gene may very well be periodically expressed in one experimental condition but not in another  <cit> . in conclusion, meaningful evaluations of detectors must be performed on simulated data. since the exact distribution of the temporal profiles of genes that are periodically expressed in any experiment is not known, it is important to study the robustness of the method when it is applied to time profiles generated from models different from those assumed in the construction of the detector.

in this work we demonstrate how bayesian inference  <cit>  can use diffuse prior knowledge about the cell-cycle period time to achieve improved detection of periodically expressed genes with a period close to that of the cell-cycle, without help from any labelled training examples provided by a supervisor. in a recently proposed empirical bayesian approach to detection of periodically expressed genes  <cit> , bayesian inference is used to compensate for undesirable phase de-synchronization among the cells in the population during the cell-cycle experiments. however, bayesian inference is not used in the critical step of designing a likelihood ratio based optimal detector that maximizes the probability of detection pd for a given choice of the probability of false alarm pfa. the new bayesian detector we introduce here calculates an approximation of the desired likelihood ratio and is based on diffuse but prior knowledge about the cell-cycle period time that has not been employed in earlier approaches.

we compare the performance of the bayesian detector introduced here to two state-of-the-art algorithms for learning-free detection of periodically expressed genes. the first is a detector based on fisher's g-test  <cit> . it is the only detector proposed for this purpose that is learning-free without requiring the period time to be exactly known. the second detector is based on a combination of two separate score values. it requires the period time to be exactly known and has performed well in a recently reported study  <cit> .

RESULTS
evaluation on simulated data
simulated periodic gene expressions were generated by adding random noise drawn from a normal distribution to fixed periodic temporal waveforms . simulated non-periodic gene expressions were generated by samples from another normal distribution. we do not believe this choice of waveforms to correspond to naturally occurring time profiles. however, using several different waveforms provides information about the robustness of the detectors against model errors. in addition to the periodic waveforms, we also simulated gene expression profiles that were periodic with a multiplicative amplitude attenuation similar to what has been observed in experimental data  <cit> .

comparisons of the bayesian detector to fisher's g-test  <cit>  and a combination test proposed by de lichtenberg et al.  <cit>  were performed. in fisher's g-test, the sampling distribution of the magnitude i of the strongest fourier spectrum component ωk in samples from a sequence of independent, identically distributed gaussian distributions , is used in a classical hypothesis test. specifically, the statistic

that depends on two p-values obtained via resampling, pregulation and pperiodicity. pregulation is intended to reflect the probability that the standard deviation of a particular gene can be obtained by pure chance. pperiodicity is intended to reflect the chance of obtaining a random signal with more energy in the user defined frequency component  of interest than the corresponding energy in the particular gene time profile of interest. ptotal is defined as the product pperiodicity·pregulation.

it has been observed that the time profiles of yeast gene expression in synchronized populations exhibit attenuation  <cit> . in order to study the effect of this attenuation, we also evaluated the result of including a multiplicative exponential term e-αt to the simulated time profiles from the periodic class. the attenutation coefficient α was chosen such that that the amplitude of expression at  <dig> min was 70% of that at  <dig> min. the attenuation coefficient α was selected to reflect the rate of attenuation that has been observed in microarray time profiles of periodically expressed genes in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . as seen in figure  <dig>  the bayesian detector performs well compared to the other two detectors also on these generative models. the performances are of course expected to become worse for all detectors with growing values of α .

exact knowledge of the period time results in a sharp prior in the bayesian detector . as shown in figure  <dig>  in this case the combination test and the bayesian detector have essentially the same performance. the roc for the bayesian detector when the standard deviation of the prior has been increased to  <dig>  is also presented in figure  <dig>  now the performance drops but is still not far from the performance obtained when the period time is exactly known.

we also evaluated the performance of the bayesian detector when the simulated noise was non-gaussian  and obtained in similar results . since the bayesian detector performance is more robust against the exact waveform than the other detectors, it is expected to work better also on real data.

periodically expressed genes in s. cerevisiae
the bayesian detector was applied to three time-course experiments where mrna expression was measured using dna microarrays during the cell-cycle in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in these experiments, yeast cells had been synchronized by a method based on either α-factor , cdc <dig>  or cdc <dig> . the bayesian prior for period time was chosen so that the reported interval of frequencies encompassed 70% of the probability mass in a gaussian distribution, with its mean value equal to the average of the reported frequency interval. for illustrative purposes we show in figure  <dig> the temporal profiles for the  <dig> orfs with the largest support for periodicity in the α-factor experiments as well as the corresponding  <dig> genes with the least support. the time profiles have been sorted by the maximum a posteriori value of the phase angle.

detection of cell-cycle annotated genes
as discussed in the introduction, it is well known that some genes involved in the cell-cycle regulation are periodically expressed as well as some that are known not be periodically expressed. to what extent genes involved in the cell-cycle machinery are periodically expressed remains an open question. we addressed this question by detecting periodically expressed genes using the bayesian detector and then analyzing how many cell-cycle genes were detected.

the cell-cycle genes were defined as the list of open reading frames annotated to the biological process "cell-cycle"  or one of its descendants in the gene ontology  <cit> . out of the  <dig> open reading frames  on the microarray used,  <dig> were annotated to "cell-cycle". selection was stringent in that only orfs annotated with the evidence code inferred from mutant phenotype  were used.

the detector test statistic  was calculated for each orf in each of the experiments. by varying the detection threshold, a roc curve for each synchronization method was calculated. these roc curves show detection of cell-cycle genes from expression data using our detector . as an example, for a high value of the detection threshold τ =  <dig>   in the α-factor experiment,  <dig> orfs were detected as periodic out of which  <dig> are annotated to cell-cycle with imp evidence code . this corresponds to pd =  <dig>  and pfa =  <dig>  . this result shows that there is only strong evidence for periodic expression for about 12% of the cell-cycle genes. however, the cell-cycle genes are highly overrepresented among the genes detected as periodically expressed. the probability of finding  <dig>  out of  <dig> orfs with cell-cycle imp among  <dig> out of  <dig> genes calculated by the hypergeometric sampling distribution is ~ <dig> . similarly, finding  <dig> among  <dig> genes in the cdc <dig> experiment corresponds to a probability of ~1e- <dig>  for lists of the orfs with τ =  <dig>  in the α-factor, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> experiments see additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

detection of genes with at least one phase-specific sequence motif
we also addressed the issue of whether promoter regions of genes detected as periodically expressed are enriched with respect to cell-cycle transcription factor binding motifs. for this we used the compilation of  <dig> known and  <dig> putative sequence motifs described in  <cit> . out of the  <dig> known motifs, seven are known to be bound by phase-specific transcription factors: mcm <dig>  ecb, mcb, swi <dig>  sff, cca and scb  <cit> . the compilation encompasses  <dig> orfs in the s. cerevisiae genome, out of which  <dig> are present in the microarray dataset. there are  <dig> orfs having at least one of the seven cell-cycle motifs in their upstream region. the roc curve reflecting the detection of this group is shown in figure  <dig>  for example, with τ =  <dig>  , the probability of finding at least as many genes with either one of the cell-cycle motifs as we do among the orfs detected as periodic is  <dig> e- <dig>  and  <dig> e- <dig> . in the cdc <dig> experiment, orfs with cell-cycle motifs in the upstream region are not detected more often than what could be expected at random . note in figure  <dig> that for α-factor and cdc <dig>  only a relatively small fraction of the genes with known cell-cycle motifs are detected as periodically expressed when the probability of false alarm is low. one explanation could be that there are additional layers of regulation that prevents the periodic expression of genes whose promoter contain cell-cycle motifs, such as epigenetic regulation. therefore we decided to determine if such effects were equally prevalent for all known phase-specific motifs when studied individually.

detection of genes containing a specific cell-cycle motif
we investigated how often the seven known cell-cycle motifs occurred in the upstream region of genes detected as periodically expressed. results for τ =  <dig>  are shown in table  <dig>  none of the cell-cycle motifs were overrepresented in cdc <dig> and cell-cycle motifs cca and swi <dig> were clearly not overrepresented in upstream regions of the orfs detected in the cdc <dig> experiment. furthermore, for α-factor and cdc <dig> we noted that the detector was most successful at detecting genes with the mcb motif. figure  <dig> shows the roc curves for detection of genes with the mcb motif using the three different synchronization methods. the expression of genes with the mcb motif thus appears to be less influenced by other types of regulation than just regulation through the mcb motif, at least in the α-factor and cdc <dig> experiments.

discovering novel phase-specific motifs
since the probability of detecting a gene with at least one known cell-cycle motif is relatively low for a low rate of false alarm  we investigated whether this could be explained by the presence of other motifs, still unknown to have phase-specific expressions. we thus tested for overrepresented motifs in the sets of orfs detected as periodic in each of the experiments. we found that among the  <dig> putative motifs,  <dig> motifs were significantly overrepresented among the genes detected in the α-factor experiment. the putative motif mcm1' was also overrepresented in the cdc <dig> experiment, see table  <dig> 

rather surprisingly, we also found the lys <dig> motif, bound by the lys <dig> transcription factor and involved in regulation of genes of the lysine biosynthesis, to be significantly overrepresented among orfs detected as periodic in the α-factor experiment.

discussion
a periodic gene expression during the cell-cycle corresponds to a phase-specific expression that in turn indicates phase-specific regulation of expression. therefore, detection of periodic expressions in cell-cycle experiments has gained a lot of attention as a computational tool for improved understanding of cell-cycle regulation. often the investigator knows the cell-cycle period time roughly, and if not, it could be estimated experimentally. however, such estimates will in general be uncertain due to the small size of the sample sets available. in the bayesian framework presented here, this kind of diffuse prior information about the period time can be taken into account. as shown by means of the simulations, this results in a detector which is more robust than detectors that rely on an almost exact estimate of the cell-cycle period time.

one should note that although the prior on the period time used in the simulations presented in figure  <dig> is not very precise it results in superior performance in comparison with the fisher's g-test which considers all possible periodicities. one explanation for the superior performance of the bayesian detector on varying wave forms is due to a higher rate of false positive classifications using the g-test, since it is designed to detect all possible single periodicities. when the signals encountered contain multiple peaks in their fourier spectra, the bayesian detector still identifies them well, since the dominant term in the fourier expansion is that of the desired period. however, the fisher's g-test is designed for detection of one and only one sinusoidal signal with unknown period time. the test statistic used is the ratio of the maximum power in the fourier spectrum to the sum of powers at all frequencies. thus, for waveforms with the same fundamental frequency, the g-test statistic will decrease in magnitude if the fourier spectra contain more peaks.

as expected from theory, the bayesian detector also outperforms the combination test by de lichtenberg et al. when the estimate of the period time deviates from the true value. this deterioration of performance might be explained by the decrease in the combination test output caused by the deviation between the estimated and true period time. when the period time estimate is correct, then the bayesian detector and the combination test have essentially the same performance but having access to the correct period time is not a realistic possibility in most cases.

although the present work considers detection of periodically expressed genes with a period close to that of the cell-cycle, it is important to note that the suggested bayesian approach can easily be adjusted for design of other detectors. for example, it would be straightforward to design detectors for genes with periodic expression at a particular phase of the cell-cycle by applying a non-uniform prior on the phase angle. furthermore, the phenomena of attenuating signals due to de-synchronization of phase in the cell population under study may be incorporated in the model. this would be an interesting direction for future work. however, we noted that the decrease in performance of the detector on sinusoidal waveforms with slow attenuation was small for a low rate of false alarm. nevertheless we investigated time profiles of genes from set b <dig> of de lichtenberg et al.  <cit>  that were not detected  but could not find a predominant signal of periodicity with attenuation for any of those genes. this suggests that those genes would not have been detected even if the bayesian detector would have been modified to take attenuation into account.

the present work shows that the bayesian detector detects more genes necessary for regulation of the cell-cycle than a random detector, but that the probability of detection is low for reasonable rates of false alarm. a trivial explanation is that some genes having a mutant cell-cycle phenotype are not periodically expressed as they are needed throughout the entire cell-cycle, or regulated otherwise. nevertheless, our approach provides quantitative estimates as to what extent genes necessary for cell-cycle regulation are periodically expressed. as an example, for a stringent condition on periodicity,  <dig> out of  <dig> cell-cycle genes are detected as periodic in the α-factor experiment. in addition the reasonable but still relatively high level of false alarm rate may have the trivial explanation that many genes not required for the cell-cycle are also periodically expressed.

it is interesting to note the lack of strong coupling between periodic expression and cell-cycle transcription factor motifs in budding yeast. there are many genes having cell-cycle motifs in their promoter regions that are not detected as periodically expressed. this observation can be explained by complexities of gene regulation, e.g. regulation of chromatin accessibility  <cit> . it could also be expected that a large set of genes are conditionally cell-cycle regulated depending on the environment.

it has been argued that the synchronization methods used induce many side effects not related to the core functionality of the cell-cycle  <cit> , thus it is to be expected that different genes are periodically expressed in different experiments. our analysis supports this notion, since we found that there are a number of genes that are clearly periodically expressed in only one experiment. expression could also be regulated by combinations of transcription factors. one study supporting this idea has shown that genes sharing pairs of motifs show more similar expression patterns than when considering genes sharing single motifs  <cit> .

it is also interesting to note that many genes are detected as periodically expressed while their promoter regions contain no known cell-cycle regulated elements. wolfsberg et al.  used a set of genes determined to be periodically expressed from microarray experiments to search for novel cell-cycle sequence motifs in yeast  <cit> . consistent with the present study, the presence of most known cell-cycle motifs were not well correlated with periodic expression and a similar pattern can be expected for novel motifs. however, a strong sequence signal for mcb and mcb-like motifs was found  <cit> . our results also indicate that the mcb motif is the motif that is most strongly associated with periodic transcription. one interpretation is that genes regulated by the mcb motif have less complex regulation of expression than genes with other motifs. similar observations were made by cho et al. who used manual identification of periodically genes in cdc <dig> synchronized s. cerevisiae and studied the  <dig> bp upstream region of the periodically expressed genes  <cit> . they found that the presence of mcb and scb motifs were associated with periodicity. however, a large number of the periodically expressed genes did not have mcb, scb or any other of the known phase specific motifs  <cit> .

we find that several putative sequence motifs  <cit>  are significantly over-represented in the genes detected as periodically expressed . for instance, genes involved in dna metabolism, morphogenetic activities and organization of chromosome structure contain some of these motifs. furthermore, the putative motifs sff' and mcm1' are associated with the known cell-cycle motifs sff and mcm <dig> respectively. thus, our findings support earlier notions that these putative motifs are important for periodic expression of cell-cycle related genes.

in addition to our simulations and experiments on real data already described, the bayesian detector has also been applied to the biological test sets described by de lichtenberg et al.  <cit> . since these test sets only contain positive examples, it is important to note that they do not provide any estimate at all of the probability of false alarm which is as important as the probability of detection in a roc analysis. therefore the results obtained using these test sets are available only as supplemental information .

CONCLUSIONS
learning-free detectors that do not rely on a set of training examples are perhaps the only alternative when trying to identify the periodically expressed genes of poorly characterized organisms for which there is also limited knowledge available from closely related organisms. our simulations indicate that systematic incorporation of a priori knowledge about the cell-cycle period time using bayesian inference may improve detection performance in comparison with two other recently proposed learning-free detectors.

when applying our detector to real data from spellman et al.  <cit> , we found that genes detected as periodically expressed only contain a small fraction of cell-cycle genes inferred from mutant phenotype. we also found a statistical overrepresentation of cell-cycle regulated sequence motifs among the genes detected as periodically expressed. moreover, among the genes detected, we found  <dig> motifs that have not previously been implicated in regulation of periodic expression in budding yeast. their roles can now be tested by direct experiments and improve our understanding of cis-acting mechanisms underlying periodic transcription.
