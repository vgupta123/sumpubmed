BACKGROUND
post translational modification of proteins with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers is an essential mechanism that regulates many cellular processes including protein degradation, endocytosis, dna repair and cell signalling. the protein called nedd <dig> in humans and rub <dig> in budding yeast is a ubiquitin-like modifier that is covalently conjugated to a lysine residue in the cullin subunits of scf-type e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligases
 <cit>  and possibly a few other proteins
 <cit> . the nedd <dig> modification, also known as neddylation, of cullins is important for function and the recruitment of e2s and other components
 <cit>  to scf-type ubiquitin ligases and therefore facilitates ubiquitin conjugation of scf substrates. similar to ubiquitin, nedd <dig> conjugation requires an e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> enzyme
 <cit> . in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> , as in mammals
 <cit> , the null mutation of either nedd <dig> itself or components of its conjugation pathway, i.e. its e <dig> or e <dig> enzymes, are lethal to the cell. curiously, the nedd <dig> system is not essential for viability of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . the reason for this difference is unknown, but could reflect differences in nedd <dig> substrates between these organisms.

just as ubiquitylation is reversed by ubiquitin isopeptidases, nedd <dig> conjugation is reversed by nedd <dig> isopeptidases in a process known as deneddylation. the best characterized deneddylating enzymes include the cop <dig> signalosome subunit csn5
 <cit>  and nedp <dig> 
 <cit> . in general these enzymes are surprisingly specific for nedd <dig> over ubiquitin
 <cit> , but some have been shown to have dual specificity
 <cit> . more recently, certain cysteine proteases, encoded by herpesviruses, were also shown to display deneddylase activity
 <cit> .

in all eukaryotic organisms the nedd <dig> gene is conserved  and encodes a non-conjugatable precursor that contains one or more residues downstream of the mature c-terminus at position  <dig>  to generate mature nedd <dig> from the inactive precursor, specific hydrolases cleave off the c-terminal residues generating a diglycine motif in the mature nedd <dig> c-terminus
 <cit> . this precursor processing is strictly required for nedd8’s recognition by the e <dig> enzyme and so the enzymes that catalyse this processing must be essential for nedd <dig> function.

in s. cerevisiae the sole nedd8-precursor processing enzyme has been identified as yuh1
 <cit>  . in the yuh <dig> null mutant, there is no longer any neddylation of cullin1
 <cit> . here, we present results aimed at identifying the nedd <dig> processing enzyme important for nedd <dig> function in s. pombe. we show that unlike the situation in budding yeast, s. pombe cells contain several enzymes capable of processing the nedd <dig> precursor.

methods
s. pombe strains and techniques
fission yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of the wild type heterothallic strains 972h- and 975h+. standard genetic methods and media were used and s. pombe transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure
 <cit> . the pcr mutagenesis was performed according to a previously published procedure
 <cit> .

antibodies
the antibody to tubulin was the tat- <dig> monoclonal . the antibodies to s. pombe cul1/pcu <dig> have been described before
 <cit> , and were kindly provided by prof. dieter a. wolf .

plasmids, expression and purification
the e. coli expression constructs used here were wild type cdna encoding uch <dig>  uch <dig>  nep <dig> and nep <dig> subcloned to the pgex-kg or pgex-6p- <dig> vector . all recombinant proteins were expressed as glutathione s-transferase  fusion proteins in e. coli bl <dig>  plyss and purified on glutathione-sepharose beads  by standard methods. the protein: bead ratio was normalized by sds-page and coomassie staining.

assays
for analyses of the deneddylating activity of purified recombinant proteins and in cell extracts, the flourogenic substrate, nedd8-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin   was used according the instructions provided by the manufacturer and as described previously
 <cit> . protein concentrations were determined by bradford assays . ubiquitin aldehyde  was used at  <dig> μm, while o-phenanthroline  was used at  <dig> mm.

RESULTS
uch1/yuh <dig> is a deneddylating enzyme
the orthologue of yuh <dig> in s. pombe is uch1+, which has a paralogue, uch2+. to investigate the role of uch1+ in the nedd <dig> pathway, we created a null mutation in the uch1+ gene by pcr mutagenesis.

we first noted that cells carrying this Δuch1::g <dig> mutation were viable  and appeared to have no physiological ill effects. if uch <dig>  as yuh <dig> in s. cerevisiae, was the sole nedd8-precursor processing enzyme, we would have expected the uch1+ deletion to be lethal. in order to detect any change in the neddylation status of a nedd <dig> substrate we replicated the experiment carried out in s. cerevisiae <cit> . we used an antibody to fission yeast cullin  <dig> 
 <cit>  to detect cul <dig> in cell extracts prepared from the Δuch <dig> strain. unlike in s. cerevisiae, cul <dig> was neddylated to a similar extent in wild type and Δuch <dig> s. pombe strains .

to assess whether or not s. pombe uch <dig> could process nedd8-precursor in vitro we purified a gst-tagged version of uch <dig> and used nedd8-amc as a substrate. from this, we observed that uch <dig> was indeed capable of processing nedd8-amc in vitro .

uch2/uch <dig> accounts for some deneddylating activity in fission yeast
in an attempt to isolate other potential nedd8-precursor processing enzymes we turned to uch2+, a paralogue of uch1+, and carried out the same set of experiments as described above using a gst-tagged version of uch <dig> , a Δuch2::ura <dig> strain, and a double Δuch1Δuch <dig> strain . as can be seen from these data, despite the fact that uch <dig> is capable of processing nedd8-amc in vitro , the deletion of both homologues of yuh <dig> in s. pombe does not result in any loss of cul <dig> neddylation . in addition, no loss in cell viability was apparent , as would be expected in a nedd <dig> compromised s. pombe strain.

deneddylating enzymes are functionally redundant
two genes that appear to be orthologues of the mammalian nedp1/den <dig> have been identified in s. pombe <cit> . these are nep1+ and nep2+. in mammalian cells nedp1/den <dig> has been described as a nedd8-precursor processing enzyme
 <cit> , and while s. pombe has two such orthologues, s. cerevisiae has none. we hypothesised therefore that these enzymes may possess the remaining nedd8-precursor processing activity in s. pombe that was unaccounted for by the two yuh <dig> orthologues. to ascertain this, we created gst-tagged versions of nep <dig> and nep <dig> and showed that these have processing activity in vitro . we then created null mutants in each of these genes, Δnep1::g <dig> and Δnep2::arg <dig>  and crossed them to our double mutant Δuch1Δuch <dig> strain in attempt to completely abrogate processing function in fission yeast. surprisingly, we found that this Δnep1Δnep2Δuch1Δuch <dig> strain was entirely viable , and cul <dig> could be efficiently neddylated in this strain .

the final candidate we examined as a potential nedd <dig> processing enzyme in fission yeast was csn5+. this subunit of the cop9/signalosome complex is well described as a metalloprotease capable of deconjugating nedd <dig> from its cullin substrates
 <cit> . indeed, as observed before
 <cit> , hyperneddylation of nedd <dig> was readily apparent in our Δcsn5::ura <dig> mutant . whether csn <dig> can process nedd8-precursor, however, is unclear. the Δcsn <dig> mutant was crossed to the quadruple knockout strain to create a Δnep1Δnep2Δuch1Δuch2Δcsn <dig> strain. even this quintuple knockout strain was viable . however, the hyperneddylation of cul <dig> observed in the Δcsn <dig> single mutant  was not as apparent in the Δnep1Δnep2Δuch1Δuch2Δcsn <dig> strain, suggesting that a reduced amount of processed nedd <dig> is available for cul <dig> modification in this background . despite this effect on cul <dig> neddylation, the quintuple knockout strain did not display any growth defect when compared to the wild type control or the other mutants .

deubiquitylating enzymes also provide deneddylating activity
in an attempt to estimate the remaining nedd8-precursor processing activity we examined the nedd8-amc processing activity of the Δnep1Δnep2Δuch1Δuch <dig> and Δnep1Δnep2Δuch1Δuch2Δcsn <dig> strains. this was done by preparing protein extracts of the strains and incubating with nedd8-amc as described previously
 <cit> . the results revealed that albeit the processing activity in these strains was reduced, it was by no means eliminated . most deubiquitylating and deneddylating enzymes in fission yeast are cysteine proteases, but a few are metalloproteases
 <cit> . to determine what may be responsible for this remaining activity in the quintuple mutant we used two enzymatic inhibitors, ubiquitin aldehyde and o-phenanthroline. ubiquitin aldehyde is used to inhibit deubiquitylating enzymes, while o-phenanthroline inhibits metalloproteases. as evident from the data, while ubiquitin aldehyde can inhibit some of the remaining activity from the Δnep1Δnep2Δuch1Δuch2Δcsn <dig> strain, o-phenanthroline cannot . this implies that the remaining activity present in the Δnep1Δnep2Δuch1Δuch2Δcsn <dig> strain is due to the activity of ubiquitin protease, but not metalloproteases.

discussion
in the present work we found that unlike in s. cerevisiae, the nedd8-precursor processing activity in s. pombe is not solely associated with the yuh <dig> orthologue uch1+. in fact the deletion of five candidate genes for nedd8-precursor processing activity appears to have little physiological effect on the cell, despite the predicted lethality associated with the lack of nedd8-precursor processing in fission yeast.

at first we were surprised by these results, but perhaps it is not so unexpected given what we know of nedd <dig> in s. pombe, i.e. that lack of nedd8-precursor processing will undoubtedly lead to death of the cell, and that nedd <dig> and ubiquitin are 50% identical in amino acid sequence. perhaps the requirement for nedd8-precursor processing, forces the cell to utilize those enzymes which perform a similar function for ubiquitin, turning them into nedd8-precursor processing enzymes. this is suggested by the remaining processing activity and cell viability once the genes for the five enzymes uch <dig>  uch <dig>  nep <dig>  nep <dig> and csn <dig> were deleted. despite these data, it is possible that in the wild type cell under normal physiological conditions, there is only one main nedd8-precursor processing enzyme in s. pombe, and it is only when the function of this enzyme is lost that the cell recruits other enzymes to perform the vital task of nedd8-precursor processing in fission yeast.

the observation that hyper neddylation of cul <dig> is lost in the quintuple mutant also suggests that these five enzymes provide the cell with most of the nedd8-precursor processing activity. however, since the quintuple mutant is viable, a limiting amount of processed nedd <dig> must be sufficient to support neddylation.

some dubs are regulated on the level of their subcellular localization
 <cit> . we note that our deneddylation assays were performed in cell extracts, and therefore do not take this into account.

recently, nedd <dig> overexpression was found to result in neddylation of ubiquitin substrates catalyzed by ubiquitin enzymes
 <cit> . this atypical neddylation suggests that ubiquitin activating enzymes can moonlight as nedd <dig> activating enzymes. the results presented here suggest that deubiquitylating enzymes similarly may also target nedd <dig>  these results are also in agreement with a recent paper on budding yeast nedd <dig>  cleavage
 <cit> , which shows that heterologous rub1-ubiquitin chains are disassembled by the cop <dig> signalosome and proteasome-associated dubs. hence, although yuh <dig> in budding yeast appears to be the major processing enzyme in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the profound structural similarity between ubiquitin and nedd8
 <cit>  leads to functional cross-talk in both yeasts.

CONCLUSIONS
unlike the situation in budding yeast, several enzymes contribute to nedd <dig> precursor processing in s. pombe, including a number of deubiquitylating enzymes. this functional redundancy may be connected with the essential nature of nedd <dig> conjugation in fission yeast.
