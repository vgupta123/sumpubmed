BACKGROUND
defects in the brca <dig> or brca <dig> genes are responsible for most hereditary forms of breast cancer and account for as many as 10% of all breast cancer cases  <cit> . women with a strong family history of cancer who possess a harmful brca <dig> or brca <dig> allele are at high risk for developing breast cancer within their lifetime   <cit> . in addition, brca <dig> mutation carriers have a 30-40% chance of developing ovarian cancer, while brca <dig> mutations also increase the risk of ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and male breast cancer  <cit> . cancers occur when heterozygous individuals experience a somatic loss of heterozygosity event at the brca <dig> or brca <dig> locus, leaving only the abnormal allele intact. because both gene products play a critical role in key cellular processes such as dna repair, cell cycle control, and transcriptional regulation, it is clear why inactivating mutations are so detrimental. the importance of these proteins is further evidenced by the fact that both brca <dig> and brca <dig> null mice are embryonic lethal  <cit> .

given their indispensible functions in maintaining the integrity of the genome, one might expect strict evolutionary conservation of brca <dig> and brca <dig> over time. indeed, some regions of brca <dig> have experienced purifying selection strong enough to operate even on synonymous mutations  <cit> . however, contrary to this line of reasoning, a number of groups have documented the rapid evolution of brca <dig> <cit>  and brca <dig> <cit>  in mammals. rapid evolution occurs when a gene experiences positive natural selection for new, advantageous mutations that arise in a population. because advantageous mutations commonly involve a change in protein sequence , recurrent rounds of positive selection in a gene lead to rapid evolution of the encoded protein sequence over time. for brca <dig>  the evolutionary rate was particularly elevated on the branches leading to humans and chimpanzees   <cit> . the identification of this signature in brca <dig> suggests that some alleles and polymorphisms currently circulating within the human population may offer a selectable advantage. however, both the cause and consequence of this unexpected mode of evolution seen in brca <dig> remain unknown.

here, we report an extensive evolutionary analysis of the primate brca <dig> gene. in previous studies of brca <dig> evolution, only exon  <dig> was examined with a limited number of primate species included in the analyses  <cit> . to extend previous studies, we have generated full-length brca <dig> sequences for  <dig> additional primate species. using this more extensive dataset, we validate the finding of positive selection in humans and their closest ape relatives ). we also show that specific codons in brca <dig> have experienced recurrent positive selection over evolutionary time, both within and outside of exon  <dig>  resulting in a small number of highly variable residue positions in an otherwise highly conserved protein. in addition, we sequenced exon  <dig> of brca <dig> from populations of chimpanzee, bonobo, and rhesus macaque  individuals and found that several unique polymorphisms exist within these populations. two polymorphisms in the chimpanzee population were found to be in hardy-weinberg disequilibrium suggesting that selection may still be operating on this gene in modern times. lastly, exon  <dig> of brca <dig>  another important genetic determinant for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, was also sequenced from diverse primate species. this gene also bears the surprising signature of positive selection. it is unclear why these critical genes bear this unusual evolutionary signature, but we present one possible hypothesis involving interactions between dna repair proteins and viruses.

RESULTS
brca <dig> is evolving under positive selection in primates
to expand our understanding of the positive selection shaping brca <dig> in primates, we obtained cell lines from  <dig> simian primate species, harvested total rna, and created cdna libraries. from these, the  <dig>  kilobase full-length coding region of brca <dig> was sequenced. these sequences were combined with full-length brca <dig> sequences from six primate species with available genome projects, creating an alignment of  <dig> full-length brca <dig> sequences.  <dig> out of the  <dig> full-length sequences have never before been analyzed .

the type of selection that a gene has experienced can be inferred from its rate of accumulation of non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitutions over time. protein-altering mutations are far less likely to be tolerated than synonymous mutations, and so dn/ds < <  <dig> for the vast majority of genes encoded by human and other mammalian genomes  <cit> . some genes, such as pseudogenes, evolve neutrally with dn/ds ~  <dig> because there is not strong selection for or against new mutations in these genes. finally, selection in favor of non-synonymous mutations results in a dn/ds >  <dig>  these genes are classified as being under positive selection, and are experiencing continued selection for “innovation” at the protein sequence level. in these genes, not only has the penalty against protein-altering mutations been relaxed, but this very type of mutation is being selectively retained. using paml  <cit> , we fit the full-length brca <dig> alignment  to models of positive selection where a subset of codons is allowed to evolve with dn/ds >  <dig>  and to null models not allowing positive selection . likelihood ratio tests revealed that the dataset fit the positive selection models significantly better than the null models . thus, brca <dig> has experienced selection in favor of non-synonymous mutations over the speciation of simian primates.

we next estimated dn/ds values on each branch on the primate evolutionary tree using the free-ratio model in paml. as expected, most branches exhibited a dn/ds <  <dig> . the branch leading to humans had the most elevated signal with a dn/ds of  <dig> . the second highest value of dn/ds on the brca <dig> tree is found on the branch leading to the last common ancestor of bonobos and chimpanzees, with a dn/ds of  <dig> . because the free-ratio model is highly parameterized, we next compared one-ratio and two-ratio models to determine whether selection has differentially affected the human, chimpanzee, and bonobo clade. as shown in figure 1b, our simian primate dataset fit the two-ratio model significantly better than the one-ratio model, with the human, chimpanzee, and bonobo clade exhibiting a dn/ds of  <dig> , while all other branches had a dn/ds of  <dig> . in summary, our extended primate dataset shows that brca <dig> is experiencing positive selection, and that the most intense selection has operated on the human/chimpanzee/bonobo clade.

based on a comparison of extant and predicted ancestral sequences, humans are estimated to have accumulated  <dig> substitutions in the brca <dig> gene since their divergence from chimpanzees and bonobos six million years ago,  <dig> of which are non-synonymous . in order to understand how unusual this is, we looked at the evolution of other genes, specifically ones encoding brca1-interacting proteins, along the branch leading to humans. because we do not have extended sequence sets for all of these genes, we took a simpler approach. for each gene, we aligned the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla sequences and manually counted the number of human-specific substitutions . these were categorized as non-synonymous  or synonymous  based on how they affected the codon in which they were found. when these values are normalized to gene size, brca <dig> has the highest enrichment of non-synonymous substitutions . care must be taken in comparing this metric between genes, because different genes have different equilibrium codon frequencies, and therefore have different mutational opportunities for synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. however, the brca <dig> gene has an enrichment ratio that is more than 4-fold higher than any of the other genes shown .

brca <dig> encodes a  <dig> kda protein with two conserved domains: an n-terminal ring domain and two tandem c-terminal brct domains . the ring domain has e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity that is essential in the dna damage response. the brct motifs function as a protein-protein interaction module that binds phosphorylated proteins involved in dna repair, cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling, and transcription. there is also a coiled-coil region between these two domains. interestingly, all but one of the non-synonymous substitutions predicted to have occurred in the human/bonobo/chimpanzee clade fall outside of these known structural motifs .

human variation at selected sites in brca1
the m <dig> model allows a class of codons to evolve under positive selection .  <dig> codons were identified as belonging to this class with a high posterior probability . these codons do not lie in the region of brca <dig> where it was previously reported that selection might be acting against synonymous mutations  <cit> , potentially given rise to a false signature of dn/ds >  <dig>  instead, all  <dig> sites show high variability between primate species at the protein level, often encoding very dissimilar amino acids . next, these positively selected codon positions were examined for variability within the human population. the breast cancer information core  is a repository of human brca <dig> polymorphisms. using this database, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  at amino acid sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . at four out of these five sites , we find that some human brca <dig> alleles encode a unique amino acid not observed in any of our primate sequences. in addition, snps known to cause human disease occur in six out of  <dig> sites. in all cases, these disease-linked snps are not amino acid-altering mutations, but rather more radical frame-shifting or nonsense mutations . in particular, nonsense mutations occurring in codon  <dig> are among the most common mutations documented in the bic. in figure 3b, all  <dig> sites of positive selection were mapped onto a domain diagram of brca <dig>  along with the most common human non-synonymous snps found in the bic . as described previously for mutations accumulated in the human/chimpanzee/bonobo clade, all but one of the positively selected residues  lie outside of any known structural motifs. in summary, the  <dig> codon positions identified in this analysis are highly variable between primate species and within the human population, and are involved in the etiology of cancers associated with this gene. disease-associated snps at these sites tend to be radical, protein-truncating mutations. however, a presumably distinct phenomenon appears to be driving selection in favor of non-synonymous point mutations at these positions.

brca <dig> variation in other primate populations
so far, we have documented sequence differences between the brca <dig> proteins of different primate species. we have shown that non-synonymous substitutions are accumulating in brca <dig> faster than expected under constrained, or even neutral, evolution. we next wished to explore whether positive selection is still acting on brca <dig> in modern populations. there is already evidence that this is true in the human population, because several brca <dig> snps have been found to depart from hardy-weinberg equilibrium in european populations  <cit>  and in australia  <cit> . we wished to determine if the same might be true in bonobo and chimpanzee populations. we amplified and sequenced the largest brca <dig> exon, exon  <dig> which is ~ <dig>  kilobases and comprises ~61% of the brca <dig> coding region, from the genomic dna of seven bonobo and  <dig> chimpanzee individuals . in bonobos, we found nine polymorphic sites, eight of which were single nucleotide polymorphisms , with three of these being non-synonymous. eight of the snps were in hardy weinberg equilibrium. interestingly, one bonobo individual was also homozygous for a seven amino acid deletion  . hardy-weinberg equilibrium was rejected for this polymorphism, although the support was weak and did not survive correction for multiple testing . the chimpanzee sequence set revealed nine snps, seven of which were non-synonymous. interestingly, in this larger sample set , three of the non-synonymous snps were found to be in hardy weinberg disequilibrium, suggesting that selection is acting either for  or against  these mutations. the support for one of these  was weak and did not survive correction for multiple testing . it is particularly intriguing to see that humans also share with chimpanzees this same s/g snp at position  <dig>  in both the bonobo and chimpanzee populations, all synonymous snps were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium.

we also sequenced exon  <dig> from  <dig> rhesus macaque individuals. rhesus macaques are not part of the human/chimpanzee/bonobo clade and are instead distantly-related members of the old world monkey clade . in these macaques, we found  <dig> snps in brca <dig>  with seven being non-synonymous . this includes a snp found at position  <dig>  a site of positive selection in the inter-species dataset. this codon is also the site of a known disease-linked mutation in humans; however, the cancer-linked snp at this position introduces a stop codon. nonetheless, all of these are in hardy-weinberg equilibrium.

caution must be used when interpreting signatures of selection acting on polymorphisms in primate populations. when sampling primates, it is not possible to get completely random and non-related population sets. deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium may occur due to factors other than selection. reasons for falsely rejecting hardy weinberg equilibrium include 1) non-random mating, 2) small population sizes which magnify the effects of genetic drift, 3) introduction of new alleles, 4) population subdivision or admixture, 5) biases in sequencing errors, and 6) linkage disequilibrium with another locus under selection. because the chimpanzee population consists of individuals from two different subspecies, admixture could plausibly lead to rejection of hardy weinberg equilibrium.

we also performed the mcdonald-kreitman and tajima’s d tests on our datasets . the tests were not significant and therefore do not support selection acting on any of these polymorphisms. false conclusions in this test can again result from a population with hidden structure. in summary, while the analyses using the simian primate dataset consisting of  <dig> species suggest that recurrent positive selection has been acting on brca <dig> over the course of several million years, the hardy-weinberg equilibrium tests performed here and by others indicate that selection is acting on modern day humans, and possibly also chimpanzees.

brca <dig> is also evolving under positive selection in primates
because of the rapidly evolving nature of brca <dig>  we also completed an evolutionary analysis of brca <dig>  another strong determinant for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. although brca <dig> has been shown to be under positive selection, only a small number of primate species was included in this study  <cit> . we sequenced the ~ <dig> kilobase exon  <dig> from  <dig> primate species. exon  <dig> is the largest of  <dig> exons and encodes about 50% of the entire brca <dig> protein. the sequences, along with six additional sequences from available genome projects, were assembled into a multiple alignment . we fit the alignment to positive selection and null models as described above. the positive selection models were again a significantly better fit to the sequence set than the null models, with a p value ≤  <dig>  . in summary, brca <dig> is under positive selection in primates as well, although this signature appears not to be concentrated on the human/chimpanzee/bonobo clade .

in contrast to brca <dig>  brca <dig> is a  <dig> kda nuclear protein that is exclusively involved in the homologous recombination pathway for repairing double-strand breaks. the eight brc motifs and the extreme c terminus mediate interactions with and recruitment of rad <dig>  a protein that catalyzes strand invasion during homologous recombination  <cit> . all eight brc repeats are encoded within exon  <dig>  the m <dig> model estimates that five codons are evolving under positive selection with posterior probability >  <dig>  . two of these positively selected sites were found to have a human polymorphism documented in the bic . when all five sites of positive selection are mapped onto a domain diagram of brca <dig> , they cluster within the first three brc domains  and the intervening regions . to examine this further, we aligned the amino acid sequence of all eight brc repeats of human brca <dig> and highlighted sites  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . surprisingly, all three sites of positive selection lie adjacent to a hydrophobic motif  known to mediate interactions with rad <dig> . since the co-crystal structure of the brca <dig> brc <dig> in complex with rad <dig> is available, we mapped these three sites to their analogous positions in brc <dig> and found that they are in close proximity to the rad <dig> binding interface   <cit> . the clustering of these residues near this interface might provide a clue to the driver of natural selection at these sites.

discussion
nearly all known cases of recurrent positive selection in primate genomes involve genes in one of three categories: 1) immunity, 2) environmental perception , or 3) sexual selection and mate-choice  <cit> . this is due to the fact that ever-changing external stimuli  drive the selection of new allelic variants. for example, immunity factors that are constantly challenged by pathogens exhibit some of the most striking signatures of positive selection seen in primate genomes  <cit> . here, immunity genes will experience positive selection for protein-altering mutations that improve recognition of a relevant pathogen. conversely, the pathogen will counter-evolve to escape detection, again placing selective pressure on the host population for new mutations that improve the immunity protein. this cycle can repeat itself indefinitely, resulting in an ever-escalating host-virus arms race. therefore, it is surprising to see that brca <dig> and brca <dig>  genes that do not classically fit into any of the three categories listed above, are evolving in a similar manner to these highly adaptive immunity genes. in addition to the two described here, other dna repair genes have also been shown to evolve under positive selection  <cit> , but the driver behind this unusual finding remains to be identified.

an intense battle exists between host dna repair machinery and viruses, and we propose that this could contribute to the evolutionary signatures documented here. many viruses are known to interact with the dna repair machinery and cell cycle regulators  <cit> . one fundamental issue is that the free ends of viral genomes are exposed, in contrast to the host’s dna, which is capped by telomeres. despite this, many viruses need to access the nucleus where the host’s dna repair machinery recognizes these un-capped viral genome ends as “damaged” cellular dna, activating the dna damage response. in order for productive infection to proceed, viruses must actively thwart these host repair pathways. for example, dna repair proteins interfere with the adenovirus lifecycle by concatenating the ends of newly synthesized viral dna, inhibiting efficient packaging into viral progeny  <cit> . in turn, adenovirus has evolved a way around this blockade by encoding proteins that mislocalize or degrade the specific host factors involved. depending on the virus involved, host dna repair factors can also be hijacked to facilitate viral replication. for instance, herpes simplex virus- <dig> simultaneously activates dna repair constituents that aid in viral genome replication  <cit>  and counteracts those that do not  <cit> . human immunodeficiency virus  <dig> is also known to activate the dna damage response and manipulate cell cycle checkpoints through the actions of its accessory protein vpr  <cit> . additionally, several studies have shown that specific dna repair proteins play critical roles in retroviral genome integration  <cit>  while others seem to decrease the efficiency of infection  <cit> .

one can imagine that these and other viruses that access the nucleus during replication could feasibly interact with brca <dig> or brca <dig>  driving the selection of variants that ultimately lead to decreased susceptibility to infection. however, it is possible that variant alleles selected for this purpose would have detrimental consequences to protein function in the context of host dna repair. most of the deleterious brca <dig> and brca <dig> variants characterized thus far introduce stop codons or frame-shifts that result in premature truncation of the protein, the consequences of which manifest as cancer at relatively early ages. the effects of non-synonymous point mutations, such as those documented here, might be expected to be much more subtle. the effects of subtle mutations are more difficult to assess because the resulting genomic instability may only be realized later in life and can be confounded by other genetic or environmental influences. we therefore propose a hypothesis where viruses are driving the intriguingly rapid rate of evolution seen in brca <dig> and brca <dig>  potentially giving rise to antagonistic pleiotropy. this would be analogous to the malaria and sickle cell anemia trade-off that is well documented  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the brca <dig> and brca <dig> proteins play key roles in the repair of damage to chromosomal dna. we have expanded the analysis of the evolution of these genes, showing that both have been subject to recurrent positive selection during simian primate speciation. although the force or forces driving the diversifying selection of these genes is unknown, the result is that the sequence of these proteins has been altered in humans and our closest living relatives. it remains to be seen whether this is an instance of antagonistic pleiotropy, where positive selection driven by one force causes functional consequences in another context, potentially the formation of cancers  <cit> .
