BACKGROUND
rice  is one of the world’s most important crops, providing a staple food for nearly half of the global population. in asia, africa, and latin america, the demand for rice is expected to increase due to the steadily increasing population  <cit> . in china, for example, rice production will need to increase by approximately 20% by  <dig> to meet the domestic demand if rice consumption per capita remains at its current level  <cit> . yet rice production is continually threatened by insects, diseases, and other stresses. in recent years, rice infestations by insects have intensified across asia, resulting in heavy yield losses  <cit> .

the whitebacked planthopper , sogatella furcifera horváth, is a serious rice pest in asia. it damages the plants by sucking sap from the phloem and transmitting viruses, which lead to reductions in plant height, number of productive tillers, filled grains, and yield  <cit> . during the tillering stage, a heavy wbph infestation results in the complete necrosis of rice plants, a condition commonly known as hopper burn  <cit> . the permanent breeding areas for the wbph are in the tropics, where the population is maintained in the paddy field throughout the year. as an insect that can travel long distances, wbph migrates from northern vietnam to southern china, and then to central china and japan, depending on the southwest monsoon in the rainy season. in temperate regions, wbphs cannot live through the winter, and they are replaced each year by immigrants from southern regions  <cit> . in rice production practices, wbph infestation is managed primarily by the use of chemical pesticides, which are both economically and environmentally costly. moreover, the pesticides kill wbph predators, and the overuse of pesticides prompts the evolution of resistance in the insects, which in turn leads to a pest resurgence. some groups have produced rice plants transformed with bacillus thuringiensis  genes for protection against wbphs  <cit> . however, the potential ecological risks of transgenic plants may limit the deployment of bt rice  <cit> . thus, the exploitation of host plant resistance has generally been considered one of the most economical and environmentally friendly approaches for the management of wbphs.

classical genetic analysis of selected rice accessions has led to the identification of six major wbhp-resistance genes, wbph <dig> to wbph <dig>  <cit> . wbph <dig> is located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> near the rflp marker, rg146a  <cit> . wbph <dig> is on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> in arc <dig>  <cit> , wbph <dig> is on chromosome  <dig> and flanked by rm <dig> and rm <dig>  <cit> . the other three wbhp resistance genes, wbph3– <dig>  have not yet been mapped to the rice genetic map. in addition to these major wbph-resistance genes, a number of quantitative trait loci  have been identified that are associated with the quantitative resistance of rice to wbphs. these qtls were identified by analyzing various rice lines, including recombinant inbred lines   <cit> , doubled haploid  populations  <cit> , introgression lines using wild rice species as the resistance donor  <cit> , and backcross-inbred lines  derived from interspecific crosses involving wild rice species  <cit> . despite the lack of molecular identity for any of the wbph resistance genes, some have been tentatively associated with either tolerance, antibiosis, or antixenosis, the three types of natural rice resistance mechanisms against wbph  <cit> .

one type of rice antibiosis resistance to wbphs is ovicidal resistance, which is characterized by the formation of watery lesions  that result in the death of the wbph eggs at those sites within 12 h of oviposition  <cit> . the egg mortality  depends on the rice developmental stage and is greatest at the maximum tillering stage. this ovicidal response to wbphs is especially prominent in the japonica cultivars in japan  <cit> . in addition, seino et al.  found that benzyl benzoate was present in the watery lesions of some japonica rice, but was undetectable in the intact plant tissue and non-watery lesions  <cit> , suggesting benzyl benzoate was the ovicidal substance in the watery lesions.

regarding the genetic basis of the rice ovicidal response to wbphs, a total of  <dig> qtls have been identified using the rice rils developed from a cross between the wbph-resistant japonica variety asominori and the wbph-susceptible indica variety ir <dig>  <cit> . four of the  <dig> qtls were further shown to be for the ovicidal trait based on the phenotyping for em  <cit> . nevertheless, our understanding of the genetic basis of wl induction for wbph resistance is extremely limited.

in addition to the continued identification of major resistance genes and qtls, our general understanding of plant resistance to insect herbivory has significantly improved with the employment of various genomic tools, one of which is global gene expression profiling  <cit> . for rice, gene expression profiling has been performed to understand the defenses against chewing insects such as the fall armyworm  <cit> , sap-sucking insect brown planthopper   <cit> , and water weevil  <cit> . these analyses showed that the defenses against these insects involved global changes in rice gene expression and led to the identification of a large number of candidate defense genes.

our study of rice resistance to wbphs has focused on the chinese japonica rice variety chunjiang  <dig> , which showed the strongest ovicidal response to wbphs among the rice lines screened  <cit> . in addition, cj <dig> exhibited sucking-inhibitory resistance to the wbph, a type of antixenosis resistance  <cit> . this dual-mechanism of wbph resistance in cj <dig> makes this variety a unique genetic material for studying rice resistance to wbphs. based on a cross between cj <dig> and tn <dig>  a wbph-susceptible indica rice, we previously constructed a dh population containing  <dig> lines. our previous characterization of the phenotypic expression of wbph resistance in this dh population  <cit>  suggested that the combined functions of both the major resistance genes and qtls affected the host-plant response to infestations by wbphs.

building on our previous work, this study had two objectives. the first was to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of rice resistance to wbphs. we aimed to identify the qtls associated with the ovicidal response, especially those for wls, using our cj06/tn <dig> dh population. once identified, these qtls were mapped to the rice genetic maps through fine mapping. the second objective was to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of rice resistance to the wbph. to this end, we conducted a microarray analysis to compare the gene expression changes in wbph-infested and uninfested cj <dig> and tn <dig> plants.

RESULTS
tn <dig> and cj <dig> exhibited distinct ovicidal responses to wbph feeding
cj <dig>  a japonica rice resistant to wbphs, and tn <dig>  an indica rice susceptible to wbphs, exhibited pronounced differences in the necrotic discoloration of the leaf sheaths following oviposition by wbphs . to quantify the differences in the ovicidal responses to wbphs of these two rice varieties, the wls were graded using a semi-quantitative scoring system  and the em rates were determined . these experiments were performed in two consecutive years,  <dig> and  <dig>  the watery lesion grades for cj <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, whereas the tn <dig> wl grades were  <dig>  and  <dig> . the two varieties also showed significant differences in the wbph-em rates, with em rates on cj <dig> of  <dig> % and  <dig> % in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, while those on tn <dig> were  <dig> % and  <dig> %.

the distribution of the ovicidal response in the dh population revealed a major locus and multiple minor loci for wbph resistance
the wl and em evaluations in the dh population derived from a cj06 × tn <dig> cross were also executed in  <dig> and  <dig>  the dh lines exhibited considerable quantitative variation for these wbph-resistance traits . for the wls, the dh lines had grades ranging from no visible symptoms  to a very strong response , with means of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . among the  <dig> dh lines,  <dig> demonstrated an ovicidal response, while  <dig> lines had non-ovicidal or slight responses, with nearly a 1: <dig> ratio of the two responses. twenty-two of the lines expressed a strong ovicidal response  in  <dig>  while  <dig> had no response . in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> lines were identified as ovicidal and non-ovicidal, respectively. the wbph-em rate on the dh lines ranged from 0–100%, with means of  <dig> % and  <dig> % in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . in  <dig>   <dig> lines resulted in high em rates, which was low  <dig> other lines. similarly in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> lines were classified as producing high and low em, respectively. the resistance levels of some of the dh lines exceeded those of the parents, which indicated the presence of transgressive variation for the ovicidal response to wbphs. the frequency distribution of the resistant-trait phenotypes for the wl and em in the dh lines clearly displayed the spectrum of one major locus and multiple minor loci for wbph resistance in the dh population.

the detection of quantitative trait loci associated with watery lesions and egg mortality
to identify the genetic loci responsible for the ovicidal response, qtl analysis was performed by doing an association analysis for the wls and em with a molecular-marker linkage map, which was available for the cj06/tn <dig> dh population. ten qtls associated with the wls and em were found and localized on six chromosomes in  <dig>  and  <dig> qtls distributed on five chromosomes were identified based on the  <dig> data . of these, some of the qtls responsible for the wls and em were co-localized on the chromosomes, while other qtls were found only in one of the two years. the qtls associated with the wls and em near rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and close to rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> were consistently detected in both  <dig> and  <dig>  however, the qtls located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were only localized in  <dig>  and the loci on chromosome  <dig> were only found in  <dig>  qtls associated with the ovicidal response were also observed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

*the numbers “1” and “2” in brackets indicate the quantitative trait loci identified in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

of the identified qtls, most showed negative additive effects, suggesting the cj <dig> alleles may increase the ovicidal response to wbphs. the loci associated with the wls that were flanked by rm <dig> and rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> presented the largest explained variance and showed additive effects. the lod  scores were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. their proportion of the phenotypic variation was over 30%, with the cj <dig> allele on chromosome  <dig> increasing the phenotypic grade for the wls to approximately  <dig> . this major qtl was named qwl <dig>  the qtls for wbph em were also found in this region both years, and the explained em variation was nearly 25%. the cj <dig> alleles on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and the long arm of chromosome  <dig> may strengthen the ovicidal response. we also found that some alleles from the tn <dig> variety may increase the resistance to wbph, such as the loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and the short arm of chromosome  <dig> 

development of the chromosome segment substitution lines for the major quantitative trait locus qwl6
based on the qtl analysis for wls, the distribution of the lod scores on chromosome  <dig> was determined . there was a slight difference in the distribution curve between the two years, but the region of the maximum lod score was similar under both years. due to the difficulty of genetically transforming typical indica in the subsequent study, the japonica parent cj <dig> was selected as the recurrent parent to introduce the susceptible qwl <dig> allele from tn <dig>  one line from the dh population was selected to cross with cj <dig>  followed by five successive backcrosses to cj <dig>  simple sequence repeat  markers rm <dig> and rm <dig> were used for the marker-assisted selection of the segregating progeny of each backcrossed generation. after five backcrosses with cj <dig>  the bc5f <dig> generation was scanned with a set of  <dig> ssr markers, which were uniformly distributed on the previous linkage map. one plant was selected, cssl20-2- <dig>  which carried a homozygous introgression from tn <dig> across the entire qwl <dig> region in the cj <dig> genetic background and was devoid of other qtls in the region . to confirm the phenotype of this line, wl production in response to wbphs was investigated. the grade of wls on cssl20-2- <dig> was dramatically reduced in comparison to its cj <dig> recurrent parent and was similar to that of tn <dig> .

fine mapping of qwl <dig> to a 122-kb region
the segregation population derived from a residual heterozygous line in the bc5f <dig> generation with heterozygosity only in the qwl <dig> region was used for fine mapping . this population displayed a clear bimodal distribution for wls and was classified into ovicidal and non-ovicidal response groups . among these  <dig> plants,  <dig> had no visible response and  <dig> plants showed strong ovicidal responses. based on the necrotic ovicidal symptoms, the  <dig> plants showing no visible response or only brownish oviposition damage were marked as not having ovicidal resistance, and the  <dig> plants with moderate to conspicuous watery lesions were designated as having ovicidal resistance. this segregation ratio fits the expected 3: <dig> ratio for single dominant gene segregation , suggesting that a single dominant gene derived from cj <dig> caused the strong wl response. the  <dig> plants without visible wls were used for further gene mapping. eight developed indel  markers and two ssr markers were selected to scan for polymorphisms between cj <dig> and tn <dig>  and five of the markers  were polymorphic between the two parents. based on these results, a regional linkage map of qwl <dig> was constructed . rm <dig>  rm <dig>  and ap <dig> were determined to be  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm from qwl <dig>  respectively, on one side; rm <dig>  ap <dig>  ap <dig>  and ap <dig> were determined to be  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm, and  <dig>  cm from qwl <dig>  respectively, on the other side. the bc5f <dig> seeds of the  <dig> plants without visible wls were harvested for further  <cit>  analysis of their ovicidal resistance in the f <dig> progeny. none of them showed ovicidal responses after oviposition by wbph .

for fine mapping of the qwl <dig> gene, the ssr marker rm <dig> on one side of the qwl <dig> target region and the indel marker ap <dig> on the other side were used to identify recombination break points in the segregating progeny derived from the residual heterozygous lines. seedlings  selected from  <dig>  bc6f <dig> progeny were transplanted into greenhouse conditions to evaluate their ovicidal resistance to wbphs. of these,  <dig> displayed no visible wls and were used for further fine mapping. the analysis of rm <dig> identified  <dig> recombination events between it and qwl <dig> on one side, and the analysis of ap <dig> detected  <dig> recombination events between the indel marker and qwl <dig> on the other side. eight polymorphic markers were available to narrow down the region of the qwl <dig> locus. ap <dig> detected  <dig> recombinants, whereas indel marker m <dig> co-segregated with qwl <dig>  the markers m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> revealed  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> recombinants, respectively, on one side, while markers m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> indicated  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> recombinants, respectively, on the other side . therefore, the qwl <dig> locus was finally delimited to an approximately  <dig> -kb dna region between the two indel markers, m <dig> and m <dig> 

this  <dig> -kb region of the nipponbare rice genome retrieved from the rice genome annotation project database  encoded  <dig> genes in its annotation . two candidate genes, loc_os06g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig>  were predicted to be phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase  and a g protein coupled receptor , respectively; the others are unknown proteins.

differentially expressed genes between cj <dig> and tn1
to further analyze the molecular mechanism underlying rice wbph resistance, whole genome transcript profiling using affymetrix microarrays was performed to examine the expression levels of all of the rice genes in infested and uninfested cj <dig> and tn <dig> plants. three-fold changes were used as a threshold to judge significantly different expression.in wbph-infested cj <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were found to be significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. in contrast, the numbers of significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes induced by the wpph infestation in tn <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . among the up-regulated genes in response to the wbph infestation in the two varieties,  <dig> were shared , while the number of genes that were down-regulated in both varieties was  <dig> .

to gain an understanding of the basis of defense, comparisons of gene expression were also made between the cj <dig> and tn <dig> plants. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed and further assigned to different functional categories . the differentially expressed genes related to secondary metabolism, defense, transport, translation, and protein turnover were overrepresented in cj <dig>  for instance, among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes for secondary metabolism,  <dig> had high levels of expression in cj <dig>  whereas only  <dig> showed high levels of expression in tn <dig> 

some of the differentially expressed genes in cj <dig> and tn <dig> are listed in table  <dig>  genes related to defense, secondary metabolism, transcription, and cell and hormone signaling were differentially expressed between cj <dig> and tn <dig>  genes encoding pathogenesis-related protein, germin-like protein, thaumatin-like protein, and α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor were drastically up-regulated in cj <dig>  after feeding by wbph, genes involved in secondary metabolism such as terpene synthase, anthranilate n-benzoyltransferase, agmatine coumaroyltransferase, and multicopper oxidase family protein were intensively up-regulated. genes pertaining to cell signaling and rna processing and transcription also showed differentially induced expression. in contrast, genes implicated in hormone signaling such as auxin-responsive protein, vq motif protein, and arr <dig> protein were strongly suppressed in cj <dig>  surprisingly, the genes that were highly differentially expressed were not located on chromosome  <dig>  where the major qtl for the ovicidal response was observed. comparing the sequences of some of the candidate genes in the 122-kb region, four of the six completely sequenced candidate genes had putative nonsynonymous substitutions . a functional difference based on the diversity of the amino acid sequences may also play an important role in wbph resistance.

expression patterns of the candidate genes in the 122-kb region
special attention was paid to the expression patterns of the candidate genes in the 122-kb region. the affymetrix array contained probes for  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate genes . while  <dig> of the genes showed no significant differences in expression, the remaining four  were identified as differentially expressed between cj <dig> and tn <dig> . the transcript level of loc_os06g <dig> was up-regulated 2-fold in cj <dig> after feeding by wbph, but did not change in tn <dig>  the expression of loc_os06g <dig> was suppressed in cj <dig>  but was up-regulated approximately 2-fold in tn <dig>  the expression of loc_os06g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig> were down-regulated more than 2-fold in cj <dig> under the wbph infestation, while there were no evident changes in tn <dig> to confirm the divergence on the microarray was due to the diversity in the genetic background, the differential expression of these four genes were further validated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  analysis . loc_os06g <dig> was up-regulated approximately 3-fold in cj <dig> during the wbph infestation, whereas there was no distinct change in tn <dig>  loc_os06g <dig> was down-regulated more than 3-fold in infested cj <dig> plants, yet it was up-regulated in tn <dig>  loc_os06g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig> appeared to be down-regulated in cj <dig> after the wbph infestation, but there was no obvious change in expression in tn <dig> in response to the wbph feeding. we also examined the expression of the other five candidate genes , but they did not display any differential expression .

discussion
the wbph sogatella furcifera horváth is a serious insect pest throughout the rice-growing regions of the world, and it has become one of the major threats to rice crops throughout asia, damaging plants both through its feeding behavior and as a viral vector  <cit> . the production of resistant varieties is an ecologically sound approach to prevent wbph infestations  <cit> . in an effort to use host-plant defenses, attempts to resolve the genetic basis of wbph resistance in rice have resulted in the identification of the six primary genes wbph <dig> to wbph <dig>  <cit> . sidhu et al. described new sources of major genes conferring resistance to wbphs in a population prevalent in northern india  <cit> . however, information regarding the genetic and molecular mechanisms of wbph resistance in rice is scarce. the major obstacle is in evaluating the resistance to wbphs; in addition, wbph resistance in rice has earned a reputation as being difficult to investigate. nevertheless, qtl analyses using genetic populations derived from crosses of nils or cssls have proven to be powerful tools for investigating the genetic and molecular basis of such quantitative traits  <cit> . several successful examples of qtl cloning resulted primarily from the development of the corresponding nils or cssls  <cit> . bph <dig> is the first rice insect resistance gene to be cloned as the result of a map-based cloning approach  <cit> . bph <dig> encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, and leucine rich repeat  protein and confers resistance to bphs, another major insect rice pest in asia.

in this study, we performed qtl mapping for the rice ovicidal response that causes the death of wbph eggs and finely mapped a major qtl for wl production that was delimited to an approximately  <dig> -kb dna region. yamasaki et al.  <cit>  identified a major qtl for the ovicidal response in the interval between r <dig> and l <dig> on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  which also contains the qwl <dig> region in our study.

there are two different resistance mechanisms to wbph in some japonica rice, namely ovicidal resistance and sucking-inhibitory resistance  <cit> . ovicidal resistance gives rise to egg mortality in the watery lesions induced at the oviposition sites, while sucking-inhibitory resistance restricts planthopper feeding and colonization on the rice plants  <cit> . in on our previous work, we identified the chinese japonica variety cj <dig> that has these two independent mechanisms, and subsequently constructed a dh population to examine their performance  <cit> . in this study, we identified a total of  <dig> qtls associated with the wls and em on eight chromosomes. the expression of the ovicidal response is somewhat suppressed in the sucking inhibitory variety under natural wbph infestations in the field, because the strong antixenosis against wbph females in these lines reduces oviposition rates. nevertheless, the cssls used in the fine mapping could lack the sucking inhibitory antixenotic effects.

among the identified qtls, some of the loci have been reported in earlier studies in different populations. the qtls on the long arms of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were reported by yamasaki  <cit> . the loci associated with the wls and em were flanked by r <dig> and l <dig> in a near-isogenic line  population  <cit> , and the qtls on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were identified by geethanjali  <cit> . some qtls co-localized with those for bph resistance, such as the locus on chromosome  <dig>  described by huang  <cit> . tan et al.  <cit>  also showed that two wbph-resistance genes in rice share the same loci with those for bph resistance, suggesting the possibility of common loci conferring resistance to both wbph and bph in rice. an analysis of the qtl information for both planthoppers in the same mapping population would help to verify this hypothesis.

it is now known that the responses by rice to bph feeding are most likely similar to pathogen-defense responses  <cit> . for example, bph <dig> is a member of the cc-nb-lrr disease resistance gene family, and it provides resistance to bph in a mechanism that is fundamentally similar to defense mechanisms against pathogens that activate a salicylic acid-dependent pathway  <cit> .

in this study, qwl <dig> was delimited to a  <dig> -kb dna region which contains  <dig> open reading frames. two candidate genes, loc_os06g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig>  were annotated to encode ppcdc and gpcr, respectively. ppcdc belongs to the lyase family, specifically the carboxy-lyases, and catalyzes the decarboxylation of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine to form 4′-phosphopantotheine. in addition, it can act as an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase ppz <dig>  which is involved in many cellular processes such as the g1-s phase transition and salt tolerance  <cit> . gpcrs are found only in eukaryotes and are involved in signal transduction. interestingly, there were no significant differences in the transcript levels of loc_os06g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig> between cj <dig> and tn <dig>  nine other unknown genes also had no significant differences in expression. however, using an affymetrix microarray, four of the unknown genes in the chromosome region containing qwl <dig> were found to be differentially expressed between cj <dig> and tn <dig>  and real-time rt-pcr authenticated that their differential expression was induced by wbph feeding. whether the mapped qwl <dig> gene is a homologous gene of known function or a new gene encoding a protein of unknown function should be determined by a genomic sequence analysis and functional complementation assays.

we examined the differential expression of genes responding to a wbph infestation between the highly resistant cj <dig> variety and the susceptible tn <dig> variety. the gene expression in cj <dig> showed more overall activity than in tn <dig>  irrespective of the presence or absence of wbphs , and a higher number of differentially induced genes  were found in cj <dig> than in tn <dig>  in addition, the expression of genes related to secondary metabolism, defense, and cell and hormone signaling showed prominent differences between cj <dig> and tn <dig>  whether infested wbphs or not. an asian rice gall midge infestation also elicited diverse responses in rice that involved the induction of genes in primary metabolism, nutrient metabolism and transport, dna synthesis, defense, and secondary metabolism  <cit> . many genes implicated in defense and stress had higher expression levels in the resistant cj <dig> variety, even absent a wbph infestation, and these genes were found to be even more strongly expressed after feeding by wbph. the results for genes related to secondary metabolism, cell signaling, translation, and protein turnover were similar.

some differentially expressed genes were anchored in the identified qtl regions. for example, loc_os01g <dig> and loc_os10g <dig> localized to the qtl region for wls between rm <dig> and rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and the region for em between rm <dig> and rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  respectively. some differentially expressed genes related to secondary metabolism and defense were also anchored in the qtl regions . however, among the genes that were highly differentially induced, none were located in the qwl <dig> interval. in addition, some nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions were identified between the resistant cj <dig> and susceptible tn <dig> varieties, implying a functional difference in the resulting amino acid sequences may play an important role in wbph resistance.

these results provide important genetic information for improving rice in that the markers tightly linked to qwl <dig> could facilitate the incorporation of ovicidal alleles into rice breeding lines and the selection of plants with the ovicidal response. the wbph populations on some of the varieties derived from the crosses between the indica and japonica varieties were six times higher than those on the ovicidal japonica variety reiho  <cit> , demonstrating that qwl <dig> is crucial for japonica varieties. in future breeding, when transferring useful indica genes into japonica varieties, the improved lines must retain the japonica ovicidal allele at qwl <dig> to suppress the proliferation of wbphs. it would also be feasible to transfer qwl <dig> into the non-ovicidal indica varieties by marker-assisted selection as a means of suppressing the wbph population in those cultivated areas. the identification of qwl <dig> and the ovicidal qtls is an initial step facilitating the positional cloning of a gene and qtls that confer resistance to insect oviposition in rice by utilizing the indel markers linked to qwl <dig> and the ovicidal qtls as the starting points. this positional cloning would also clarify the molecular and genetic mechanisms of the ovicidal response to wbph.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> qtls associated with wls and em in two different years, and qwl <dig> was identified as a major qtl in the rice response to infestation by wbph. based on the cssls and residual heterozygous population, qwl <dig> was delimited to a 122-kb region on chromosome  <dig>  an affymetrix microarray analysis showed that the resistant-cj <dig> and susceptible-tn <dig> varieties had different responses to wbph feeding. in addition, four genes in the 122-kb region of the qwl <dig> locus were differentially regulated in cj <dig> and tn <dig> in response to wbph infestation, suggesting they may be candidate resistance genes. these results will facilitate isolating this important resistance gene and its use in breeding wbph-resistance rice.
