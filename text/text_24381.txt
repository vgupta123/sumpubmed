BACKGROUND
to understand complex cell systems, functional analysis of proteins has become the main focus of growing research fields of biology in the post-genome era; however, the roles of many proteins in cellular events remain to be elucidated. among various methods to elucidate protein functions, the approach of chemical genetics is notable, with small molecular compounds used as probes to elucidate protein functions within signal pathways  <cit> . indeed, several bioactive compounds have led to breakthroughs in understanding the functional roles of proteins  <cit> ; however, one significant hurdle to developing new chemical probes of biological systems is identifying the target proteins of bioactive compounds, discovered using cell-based small-molecule screening.

a variety of methods and technologies for identifying target proteins have been reported  <cit> . among them, affinity chromatography is often used for identifying biological targets of multiple small molecules of interest; however, it is usually very difficult to identify compound-targeted protein with low expression because of the low sensitivity of detection using coomassie brilliant blue  staining and ms/ms analysis. thus, target identification of small molecules using affinity chromatography is severely limited. to overcome the limitations of affinity chromatography, we propose a new protocol combining in silico screening and experimental verification for identification of target proteins.

in our previous work, we developed an in-silico screening system, called “copicat” , to predict the comprehensive interaction between small molecules and target proteins  <cit> . if a target protein is input in the system, a list of chemical compounds which are likely to interact with the protein is predicted. in our previous work, several potential ligands for the androgen receptor were predicted by this system, these predictions were experimentally verified, and a novel antagonist was found  <cit> . on the other hand, if a chemical compound is input in the system, a list of proteins which are likely to interact with the compound is predicted by the system.

previously, we isolated the natural product incednine from the fermentation broth of streptomyces sp. ml694-90f <dig>  which consists of a novel skeletal structure, enol-ether amide in the 24-membered macrolactam core, with two aminosugars. in addition, it was reported that incednine induced apoptosis in bcl-xl-overexpressing human small cell lung carcinoma ms- <dig> cells when combined with several anti-tumor drugs including adriamycin, camptothecin, cisplatin, inostamycin, taxol, and vinblastine  <cit> . because this compound inhibits the anti-apoptotic function of bcl-2/bcl-xl without affecting its binding to pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family proteins, it may target other proteins associated with the bcl-2/bcl-xl-regulated apoptotic pathway. to address the mode of action of incednine underlying its interesting function, we first synthesized affinity-tagged incednine which is biologically active , and proteins bound to incednine were separated by sds-page followed by cbb staining, and each protein band was directly identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry analysis. fifty-three proteins were identified as listed in table  <dig>  and some of which, such as eukaryotic initiation factor 4a <dig>  prolyl 4-hydroxylase, beta subunit , heat shock protein  <dig> , and protein phosphatase 2a  were reported to relate to cancer cell survival <cit> . therefore these were knocked down by sirna or inhibited by a specific inhibitor, and assessed for their ability to modulate bcl-2/bcl-xl anti-apoptotic function, as does incednine. however, the candidate proteins tested did not appear to be the target responsible for modulating bcl-2/bcl-xl anti-apoptotic function . therefore, the target protein of incednine responsible for modulating bcl-2/bcl-xl anti-apoptotic function has not yet been determined, and further candidate proteins as targets of incednine are expected to emerge.

in this context, we propose a new protocol combining in silico screening and experimental verification for the identification of target proteins. we first predicted the candidate proteins likely binding to the input compound by applying the copicat system, and then employed western blotting to detect the binding of predicted proteins to the input compound. this method solves the problem of the low sensitivity of the traditional method .

RESULTS
computational prediction of target proteins for incednine
we set the chemical compound “incednine” as the binding ligand, and candidate proteins for the targets of incednine were computationally predicted from the kegg database by using the statistical prediction method for protein-chemical interaction. the training dataset of protein-chemical interactions to construct the svm-based statistical learning model was collected from the approved drugcards data in the drugbank database  <cit> , and  <dig> interactions with incednine obtained from our previous binding experiments using affinity chromatography  because the prediction accuracy was increased when more training samples of protein-chemical interactions were given to the svm-based statistical learning model. among  <dig>  human proteins in the kegg repository,  <dig> proteins were newly predicted as positive, that is, to interact with incednine with high probability greater than the  <dig>  threshold .

clustering of computationally predicted proteins
the  <dig> proteins that were computationally predicted to bind to incednine were clustered by the hierarchical clustering method using 199-dimentional feature vector that was used for encoding amino acid sequences to construct the svm-based statistical learning model . note that the similarity based on this 199-dimentional feature vector is different from the sequence similarity, and this similarity measure based on the 199-dimentional vector was proven to work well for protein-chemical interaction predictions in our previous work  <cit> . for example, 5htt and ar α-1a showed only about 10% sequence similarity although both were reported to interact with the mdma drug and successfully predicted by our svm-based statistical learning method. a cutoff threshold on the constructed clustering tree was determined so that the proteins were clustered into  <dig> clusters and each cluster had a statistically significant number of members. the proteins predicted to bind to incednine are listed in additional file  <dig> 

experimental verification
next, to examine whether incednine can bind to the proteins, an in vitro biotinylated incednine pull-down assay using the lysate of bcl-xl expressing ms- <dig> cells was performed. we tested  <dig> proteins as pilot experiments, which are selected from each cluster by one or two based on antibody availability. negative candidates that were predicted not to bind to incednine were extracted for experimental verification. these proteins, positive candidates and negative candidates, are listed in table  <dig>  among positive candidate proteins,  <dig> positive candidates pik3cg and acaca were found to bind to incednine, and  <dig> positive candidates dapk <dig>  pik3c2b, pip5k <dig>  chd <dig>  gtf2ird <dig> did not bind to incednine. among negative candidate proteins,  <dig> negative candidates becn <dig> and kif5b did not bind to incednine, and  <dig> negative candidate parp <dig> did bind to incednine . on the other hand, itpr <dig>  parp <dig>  plcb <dig>  kif1a, kif21b, and rgpd <dig>  listed as positive candidates in table  <dig>  were not well expressed and were not detected in bcl-xl-expressing ms- <dig> cells; therefore, accuracy of 40% , sensitivity of  <dig> %  and precision of  <dig> %  were achieved.

discussion
for target identification using affinity chromatography, conventional method requires multiple steps as follows; sds-page, cbb staining, excision of gel, destaining, reduction, trypsinization, and application to lc-ms/ms system ; these steps can be cumbersome, time-consuming and require expensive installation. furthermore, cbb staining used in conventional method can detect proteins over nanogram order. in contrast, our proposed protocol for predicting target protein allows us to use western blotting to detect proteins in picogram order. indeed, we found two incednine-binding proteins by this prediction. additionally, we can enhance the precision of copicat by feeding back the experimental results to the system.

in this work, pik3cg, parp <dig>  and acaca were revealed to bind to incednine by applying our protocol to identify potential target proteins of chemical compounds. these proteins are potential targets of incednine because it has been reported that these proteins are related to cancer survival and drug resistance, as follows.

pi3kcg encodes p <dig> catalytic subunit isoform p110γ and heterodimerizes with regulatory subunit p <dig>  composing class ib pi3k in the pi3k family  <cit> . although pik3cg and pik3c2b are distant homologous with 20% sequence identity, incednine selectively binds to pik3cg but not pik3c2b . in contrast to class ia, class ib pi3k acts downstream of g-protein coupled receptors . it has been reported that p110γ was upregulated and activated by the chimeric oncogene bcr-abl expression to contribute to cell proliferation and drug resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia  <cit> , and was found to be highly and specifically expressed among the pi3k family in human pancreatic cancer  <cit> , suggesting that class ib pi3k might relate to cell survival and drug resistance. product of enzymatic activation of class ib pi3k as class ia, phosphatidylinositol- <dig> ,5-trisphosphate, makes bad dissociate from bcl-xl and promotes cell survival via akt activation  <cit> . therefore class ib pi3k might contribute cell survival in bcl-xl-overexpressing cells.

parp <dig> is a member of the parp protein superfamily that catalyzes the polymerization of adp-ribose moieties onto target proteins, using nad+ as a substrate and releasing nicotine amide in the process  <cit> . parp <dig> activity is important for the regulation of homeostasis and the maintenance of genomic stability, participating in dna repair, the regulation of transcription, dna replication, cell differentiation, proliferation and cell death  <cit> . many in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that inhibition of parp <dig> potentiates the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs and ionizing radiation  <cit> . therefore, incednine could bind to parp <dig> and could function as antagonist of anti-apoptotic parp <dig> protein. alternatively, parp <dig> is emerging as an important activator of caspase-independent cell death. it has been previously reported that parp <dig> mediates the release of apoptosis-inducing factor , one of the initiators of caspase-independent cell death, possibly due to enzymatic over-activation  <cit> . we also observed that co-treatment of bcl-xl-overexpressing ms- <dig> cells with incednine and ant-tumor drugs induced aif release and subsequent caspase-independent cell death ; therefore, we can not exclude the possibility that incednine binds to parp <dig> and functions as parp <dig> agonist by accerelating aif release.

however, the most likely candidate of an incednine target protein is acaca , which was classified in cluster  <dig>  acaca is the rate-limiting enzyme for long-chain fatty acid synthesis that catalyzes the atp-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa, playing a critical role in cellular energy storage and lipid synthesis  <cit> . there is strong evidence that cancer cell proliferation and survival are dependent on de novo fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . additionally, acaca is upregulated in multiple types of human cancers  <cit> ; therefore, acaca may also contribute to cell survival in bcl-xl-overexpressing tumor cells. indeed, our preliminary experiments suggested that chemical inhibition of acaca using tofa  or small interfering rna-mediated acaca silencing results in the induction of apoptosis in bcl-xl-overexpressing human small cell lung carcinoma ms- <dig> cells when combined with anti-tumor drugs as does incednine , suggesting that acaca might be a molecular target of incednine. the possibility that incednine targets acaca is being actively investigated.

while our experimental verification implied the relatively low precision value  <dig> % , new detections of two incednine-binding proteins in addition to previously identified  <dig> proteins are significant. on the other hand, while we selected  <dig> candidates by clustering  <dig> predicted proteins for experimental verification, more comprehensive verification experiments for the  <dig> predicted proteins are needed.

the application of our method to incednine resulted in  <dig> %  precision according to in vitro pull-down assay. however, this relatively low precision value does not represent the true statistical significance of the method and is not comparable to the benchmark performances  by 10-fold cross-validation for copicat system.

this  <dig> % precision can be evaluated by using the following p-value.

  p−value=∑x=ptmcx×cnct 

here, n is the number of human proteins, m is the number of proteins potentially binding to the incednine, t is the number of tested proteins, and p is the number of true positives. with n = <dig> , which is the number of human proteins in the kegg repository, and m = n × 1%≒ <dig>  which is based on the overestimated assumption that 1% of all proteins could be regarded as potential binding proteins for the incednine. this p-value defines the probability that the prediction precision can be obtained by random selection of proteins. then, p-value of  <dig>  was obtained for the prediction precision  <dig> %. this small p-value means that  <dig> %  precision can be obtained with very small chance by random selection, and therefore, this small p-value proves the validity of our method.

CONCLUSIONS
although further study is required for complete determination of the target protein of incednine, this study demonstrated that our proposed protocol of predicting target protein combining in silico screening and experimental verification is useful, and provides new insight into a strategy for identifying target proteins of small molecules.
