BACKGROUND
solanum dulcamara  is an allogamous diploid  species with a genome size of ~  <dig> mb  <cit> . it is one of the few solanaceae species native to europe, although it has been widely naturalised around the world . s. dulcamara is placed in the clade dulcamaroid, one of the  <dig> well-supported monophyletic clades in the solanum section. the dulcamaroid clade is closely related to the morelloid clade, which includes s. nigrum, also native to eurasia and considered as a weed of arable fields, and next to the potato clade which includes species of economic importance such as s. tuberosum  and s. lycopersicum   <cit> .

bittersweet is adapted to grow in a wide range of ecological niches, from wet habitats such as riverbanks, lake shores and irrigation ditches to dry plains and dunes  <cit>  . it is able to produce different phenotypes under different environmental conditions and in this respect it could represent a good model to study and explore the molecular bases of acclimation and adaptation. it has been demonstrated that s. dulcamara serves as an alternative host for many agriculturally important pathogens, such as ralstonia solanacearum <cit>  and phytophthora infestans <cit>  and pests, such as the colorado potato beetle . for this reason attempts were made to eradicate it from potato cultivation areas and beyond  <cit> . on the other hand, as a host it can represent a european source of resistance genes for solanum breeding, as alternative to the currently used american sources. we have recently reported on the identification of two resistance loci to phytophthora infestans, rpi-dlc <dig> and rpi-dlc <dig>  which are located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

in spite of its important ecological role and potential to provide genetic resources for plant breeding, genomic research tools are lacking for s. dulcamara and only a very small number of nucleotide sequences  are currently available in genbank  <cit> . availability of a near-complete transcriptome, especially in combination with comparative genomics approaches and information transfer from related species with more genomics data can have a remarkable impact on the in-depth characterization of a species. combining data and knowledge from the potato and tomato genome sequencing projects  <cit>  with a de-novo rnaseq-based s. dulcamara transcriptome would thus be a powerful and valuable approach to speed up research on and exploitation of s. dulcamara.

we here present a deep sampling of the s. dulcamara transcriptome and first assessment of its complexity. the transcriptome enabled development of ssr and snp markers, of which the latter were used to generate the first genetic map of s. dulcamara. this map was compared to the maps of tomato, potato and eggplant in order to elucidate chromosomal evolution within the genus and to contribute to future gene mapping efforts.

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome assembly
short reads from seventeen different s. dulcamara cdna libraries that were sequenced using either roche gs-flx or illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing technologies  were combined to build de novo a consensus transcriptome using the trinity package  <cit> . this resulted in an assembly of  <dig>  contigs of more than  <dig> nts in size, with an average length of  <dig>  nts . the dataset encompasses  <dig>  unigenes, of which  <dig>  are clusters with multiple variants . these variants are expected to comprise allelic variants, splice variants, nearly-identical paralogs or mis-assemblies. the sequences of all contigs are available at the sol genomics network website .

functional annotation
blast annotation
to attach biological information to each contig, a multi-step annotation workflow was designed . first, sequence similarity search with blastx was performed against all tomato, potato and arabidopsis predicted proteins as well as the uniprotkb/swiss-prot sequence set  <cit> . according to this analysis, 85% of the contigs presented at least one match at an e-value of e- <dig>  no more than  <dig> contigs  were found to have matches only to the uniprotkb/swiss-prot database, of which  <dig> were similar to sequences from viruses. of these,  <dig> represented rna replication and coat proteins from the potato virus m . this is in agreement with earlier findings of pvm in s. dulcamara <cit> , confirming it may serve as a reservoir for the virus from which it could move into potato. the remaining  <dig> contigs  had significant matches to proteins from a wide spectrum of source organisms , and should be considered contaminations of the samples. second, all the contigs that did not match any protein  were searched against the genbank nucleotide non-redundant database with blastn.  <dig>  contigs had correspondence to entries in the database at an e-value of e- <dig>  most of the first hits  were sequences coming from solanaceae species, with tomato the most represented. these sequences most likely represent utrs or as yet un-annotated protein coding loci. the remaining sequences were similar to nuclear genes in genbank , mitochondrial dna , plastid dna  or ncrnas, repetitive elements and sequences annotated as genomic markers . finally,  <dig>  contigs, equal to ~9% of the assembled transcriptome, had no significant match in protein and nucleotide databases. the contigs in this dataset may encode for novel proteins, represent non-conserved utr regions or are mis-assemblies.

gene ontology and kegg ortholog annotation
in order to describe gene functions in a standard and controlled vocabulary, we used the blast2go suite  <cit> . interproscan searches were used to identify conserved protein domains in the s. dulcamara transcriptome and showed that  <dig>  contigs  had matches to conserved protein domains . mapping of the interpro entries to gene ontology  terms resulted in the assignment of  <dig>  go terms to  <dig>  contigs . the  <dig>  s. dulcamara contigs were also analysed with the kegg automatic annotation server   <cit>  to detect kegg orthologs .  <dig>  s. dulcamara contigs representing kos were identified  . furthermore,  <dig>  ec numbers could be associated to s. dulcamara contigs via the ko terms, resulting in the identification of  <dig> oxidoreductases,  <dig> transferases,  <dig> hydrolases,  <dig> lyases,  <dig> isomerases and  <dig> ligases.

all data combine to a high quality, thoroughly annotated draft of the s. dulcamara transcriptome.

comparison of protein family structure between s. dulcamara and other plant species
multi-species transcriptome comparison may be used in order to identify orthologous gene groups, measure changes in the size of protein-coding gene families, study gene family evolution and detect taxonomically restricted sequences .

orf/protein prediction
to be able to compare protein family structure between s. dulcamara and other plant species we first predicted the orfs and protein sequences encoded by the s. dulcamara contigs. estscan  <cit>  of the  <dig>  contigs indicated that  <dig>  contigs  contain putative coding sequences that could be translated into proteins. this is very similar to the percentage of contigs predicted to be protein coding by blastx , with the slightly higher percentage of the latter probably explained by the fact that blastx better tolerates sequencing errors that result in frame shifts and premature stop codons than estscan. in total,  <dig>  full-length proteins  and  <dig>  truncated proteins  were identified . to confirm the reliability of the estscan prediction we carried out blastp searches of the predicted proteins against the tomato, potato and arabidopsis protein complement. about 95%  of the s. dulcamara proteins had a significant match in at least one of these protein databases. comparison of the blastp results with the blastx results of the same contigs revealed that in  <dig> % of the cases, the best hit was identical. as a measure of the quality of our assembly, we also compared the size distribution of the subset of s. dulcamara full-length proteins to the length distribution of the proteins encoded in the genomes of tomato  and potato , the two solanum species for which a full genome sequence was published recently  <cit> . although the number of s. dulcamara full-length proteins is three to four times smaller than the number of proteins in the tomato and potato genome, protein size in the three datasets shows a similar log-normal distribution . together, these results support the reliability of the assembly and the predicted protein data set.

orthomcl clustering
orthologous gene groups were identified using orthomcl  <cit> . the analysis included protein datasets from s. dulcamara, from the related solanum species tomato and potato, as well as from the two model plant species arabidopsis and rice. as the input for s. dulcamara we used the partial and full-length proteins predicted by estscan. to ensure that each locus was represented only once in the orthologous gene group analysis, only the longest predicted protein from each variant cluster was used. similarly for the other species, only the longest protein variant encoded by a locus was used. a total of  <dig>  protein sequences from the five species were clustered into  <dig>  ortholog groups . a consensus annotation was automatically assigned to each group based on the frequency  of the most prevalent interpro entry list. in case the threshold criterion was not met, the combination of the two most frequent interpro entry lists was used. in figure  <dig>  the number of orthologous and putative species-unique gene groups is shown. of the  <dig>  proteins from s. dulcamara,  <dig>  were placed in a total of  <dig>  gene groups with multiple members and  <dig>  were not grouped and defined as species-specific singletons. as expected, a large part of the s. dulcamara gene groups  contained orthologs from all other species, thus representing genes that are highly conserved in flowering plants. high sequence conservation and high gene expression have been suggested to correlate  <cit> , which may explain why the rnaseq-based s. dulcamara transcriptome has a slight bias towards highly conserved gene groups , compared to the transcriptomes of tomato  and potato , which were derived from whole-genome sequencing. in s. dulcamara, as in the other species, many genes were species specific:  <dig> gene groups and  <dig>  singletons.

enrichment analysis
in order to understand which molecular functions were over-represented in the s. dulcamara specific set, we performed a go enrichment analysis compared to all s. dulcamara proteins used for the orthomcl clustering. the analysis showed that genes associated with the molecular function terms “kinase activity” and “transporter activity” were most significantly overrepresented , suggesting that these type of genes have evolved relatively fast in s. dulcamara. when looking at the s. dulcamara genes common only to either or both of the other two solanum species , molecular functions associated to regulation of gene expression and regulation of protein activity were enriched . again, this suggests that s. dulcamara genes involved in regulatory processes evolved relatively rapidly. because the s. dulcamara transcriptome is not complete and nearly-identical paralogs are likely to collapse into variant clusters in the assembly step, possible expansions and contractions of gene families need further study.

ssr analysis
in-silico ssr prediction
as a first effort aimed at the development and characterization of est-based ssr markers in bittersweet, the s. dulcamara contigs were examined for the presence of ssr motifs using misa . a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified . the frequency and the number of repeat units for each of the ssr motifs  are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  with the exception of mono-type and compound repeats, the average length of the ssrs was ~ <dig> nucleotides . by exploiting the orf/protein predictions from estscan, we also investigated the position of the ssrs along the transcripts . tri-nucleotide as well as hexa-nucleotide repeats are preferentially located in the coding regions, while the other types are more frequent in utrs. in particular, di-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide are preferentially located in 5' utrs, whereas mono-nucleotide ssrs are equally distributed between 5' and 3' utrs. these results are in agreement with observations in  <cit> . using the primer <dig> software  <cit> , primer pairs to amplify each ssr were successfully designed for  <dig>  transcripts and failed for  <dig>  sequences .

in-vitro ssr analysis
to verify the usefulness of the ssrs as genetic markers and assess genetic diversity within a panel of seven s. dulcamara accessions, the list of putative ssrs for which primers were designed was first reduced to  <dig> by filtering out all mono-nucleotide ssrs and considering only those contigs that have a single orthologous counterpart in the tomato genome . subsequently,  <dig> ssrs that seemed to be polymorphic in our short read libraries were amplified . capillary gel separation showed that the primer pairs for all but one ssr amplified fragments of around the expected size. all these microsatellites were polymorphic, having  <dig> to  <dig> alleles . in all cases, heterozygous individuals were identified in our panel of seven plants, which is in agreement with the outcrossing biology of the species. taken together, this shows that the set of ssrs and accompanying primer pairs is reliable and has potential use in the identification of marker-trait association as well as in the assessment of genetic diversity within s. dulcamara and between related species  <cit> .

genetic map construction
s. dulcamara contains a number of traits, such as several pathogen resistances, which may be valuable for agricultural purposes. to speed up gene mapping efforts in this species we generated a genetic map that is anchored to the high-quality genetic/physical maps of tomato. in addition to providing practically useful information on synteny and co-linearity between these two species, such a map also offers insight into genome evolution in the genus solanum.

snp identification
for map construction, we first identified sequence polymorphisms between accessions a54750069- <dig> and 944750001- <dig> for which an f <dig> population was available  <cit>  . by independently mapping the reads of the two parent genotypes to a subset of the contigs,  <dig>  putative snps were identified . the observed transition:transversion ratio of  <dig>  is very similar to what has been reported for snp types in other plant species  <cit>  .

segregation analysis and map construction
a subset of snps was identified that was heterozygous in the female parent and homozygous in the male parent  and  <dig> of these were selected in such a way that the tomato orthologs of the corresponding contigs were distributed evenly over the tomato genome . segregation of  <dig> out of  <dig> selected snp could successfully be determined in  <dig> f <dig> individuals, using kaspar assays . in addition, segregation of  <dig> aflp and  <dig> caps markers was analysed in the same individuals. linkage analysis using joinmap  <cit>  revealed the existence of  <dig> linkage groups, in agreement with the haploid chromosome number of the species. the resulting linkage groups ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> cm in size and harboured  <dig> to  <dig> markers each . synteny and co-linearity with tomato was studied using marker orthology . to better understand chromosome evolution in the solanaceae, the genetic map was subsequently compared to the integrative maps of tomato , potato , eggplant , pepper , tobacco  and their deduced common ancestors, as presented by wu and tanksley  <cit>  .

chromosomes co-linear with tomato
s. dulcamara  chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are syntenic and fully co-linear with their respective tomato  counterparts. co-linearity of sd and t chromosomes suggests that their arrangement represents the ancestral tomato/bittersweet arrangement. in case of sd1/t <dig>  sd3/t <dig> and sd8/t <dig> this is in agreement with the suggestion that also the more ancient common ancestor of tomato/bittersweet and eggplant  is likely to have had these arrangements  <cit> .

in case of chromosome  <dig>  tomato and potato contain two small inversions, located at the top and bottom ends of the chromosome, when compared to eggplant and their common solanum ancestor  <cit> . whether these occurred before or after the deviation of bittersweet could not be evaluated, because only a single and no markers are present in those regions, respectively.

the finding that sd <dig> is fully co-linear to t <dig> is surprising, because wu and tanksley  <cit>  suggested that tomato harbours an inversion that arose after the split from potato. more detailed examination of this region in potato, however, suggests this inversion is also present, but was followed-up by a second inversion, unique to potato, largely restoring the eggplant like arrangement  <cit> . thus, tomato and bittersweet have retained the arrangement ancestral to potato, in which there is a unique inversion.

chromosomes with inversions compared to tomato
s. dulcamara chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are syntenic with their corresponding tomato counterparts, but show intra-chromosomal rearrangements . the difference between sd <dig> and t <dig> is most easily explained by two subsequent inversions in the same region. the inversion between sd <dig> and sd <dig>  overlaps with an inversion seen in potato and eggplant and may thus represent the ancestral solanum arrangement  <cit> . the second inversion, between sd <dig> and sd <dig>  is similar to one seen in eggplant. wu and tanksley  <cit>  argued that this inversion is not present in the more distant relative pepper, and is thus eggplant-specific. taking into consideration our data, however, the inversion might have been present in the common solanum ancestor and reversed in the tomato/potato lineage, or alternatively, occurred independently in bittersweet and eggplant. either scenario would imply repeated use of the breakpoint. however, it should be noted that detailed examination of this chromosome segment has shown that it has undergone complex rearrangements, making conclusive interpretations difficult  <cit> .

sd <dig> shows a double inversion with respect to t <dig>  while having the same gene content. the large inversion from sd <dig> to sd <dig>  is tomato-specific, as the bittersweet structure is similar to that in potato and the ancestor of solanum. the second, nested inversion between sd <dig> and sd <dig>  is shared with the more distant relative pepper. wu and tanksley  <cit>  argued that this inversion was not easily recognisable in eggplant, which has complex re-arrangements in this chromosomal region, and was thus already absent in the ancient solanum, implying a reversal in bittersweet. a more parsimonious explanation would be that the bittersweet/pepper marker order is ancestral so solanum, and that the sd35/sd <dig> region diverged independently in eggplant and tomato/potato lineages. the translocation of the bottom half of t <dig> and potato  chromosome  <dig> with respect to eggplant and their last common ancestor must have occurred early after the split from eggplant, as it is already present in bittersweet.

sd <dig> has the same gene content as t <dig>  but shows two inversions relative to tomato, potato and eggplant, which thus occurred in the bittersweet lineage, after its separation from the tomato/potato lineage.

sd <dig> contains the same genes as t <dig>  with two inversions. the large long-arm inversion is tomato-specific; the arrangement in bittersweet being ancestral to the genus solanum. the origin of the smaller inversion at the top half is hard to deduce, because a similar rearrangement can be seen in eggplant and its more distant relative tobacco, but not in the intermediate relative pepper. irrespective of the evolutionary order of the rearrangements, this means inversions with similar breakpoints have occurred multiple times in this region.

chromosomes showing translocations relative to tomato
the gene content of tomato chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is represented by s. dulcamara chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but with a different inter-chromosomal arrangement. sd <dig> consists of the upper part of t <dig> and the upper part of t <dig>  roughly the same upper part of t <dig> associates with parts of t <dig> in eggplant and the more distant relatives pepper and tobacco  <cit> , suggesting that both, the arrangement in tomato-potato and in bittersweet are derived within their respective lineages. likewise, the same upper part of t <dig> associates with parts of t <dig>  t3/t <dig> and t <dig> in eggplant, pepper and tobacco, respectively. because of this complexity, it is impossible to deduce ancestral chromosomal arrangements and the origin of the inversions between bittersweet and tomato. repeated usage of the translocation breakpoints shows that these chromosomes are unstable over evolutionary time.

the top half of sd <dig> has the same gene content as t <dig>  but is inverted. the same inversion is not only seen in potato, but also in eggplant, pepper and tobacco, although the latter was not indicated by wu and tanksley  <cit> . this orientation thus is ancestral to solanum. however, while the top of t <dig> is associated with the bottom part of t <dig> in bittersweet, the more ancestral association is with the upper part of t <dig>  the bottom part of t <dig>  in turn, has been associated to parts of t <dig>  t4/t3/t <dig> and t <dig> in eggplant, pepper and tobacco, respectively, again indicating repeated usage of a region as a translocation breakpoint.

sd <dig> consists of the lower half of t <dig> and the bottom of half of t <dig>  the latter being inverted in orientation. this inversion can also be seen in eggplant and pepper  <cit> , and is therefore ancestral to solanum. again, these chromosomal segments have been associated to various different fragments during the evolution of the solanaceae.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a variety of genomics resources for the non-model species s. dulcamara and demonstrate their use for functional, genetic and comparative analyses. the large-scale characterization of the bittersweet transcriptome provides a first catalogue of the s. dulcamara gene repertoire and allowed snps and ssrs to be identified and successfully used as genetic markers for the generation of a linkage map and the analysis of genetic diversity, respectively. we show that molecular markers derived from transcribed regions can be anchored to the genomes of related species for map comparison. such information is very useful for gene mapping efforts, as we recently showed for mapping of the rpi-dlc <dig> locus, which is located near the inversion breakpoint on chromosome  <dig>  in comparison to tomato  <cit> . the observed chromosome inversions as deduced from the genetic map concur well with previously published data from other solanaceae and support the position of s. dulcamara in the tomato/potato clade   <cit> . furthermore, the data sustain the notion that certain chromosomal regions are more likely to serve as inversion and translocation breakpoints. for chromosome sd <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> we report a new chromosome composition of segments that in other species are also associated with translocations. for future research, the s. dulcamara transcriptome will serve as a reference for rnaseq gene expression profiling and be used to facilitate functional genomics studies. this is crucial to the identification of key regulators of important biological phenomena, such as adaptation to different environmental conditions and responses to biotic stressors. together, this will allow us not only to target genes underlying important agronomic traits, but also help us understand and exploit the unique biology of this species.
