BACKGROUND
the hypothalamus mediates homeostasis by integrating various endocrine and autonomic responses. distinct nuclei of the hypothalamus regulate sleep, circadian rhythm, energy homeostasis, sexual behaviors and thermogenesis. despite extensive studies on the physiological and clinical aspects of hypothalamic function, the molecular mechanisms defining the identity of the neuronal subtypes within each hypothalamic nucleus during development remain poorly defined.

in the murine hypothalamus, five of the neuroendocrine phenotypes  are generated during partially overlapping periods of time, mainly from the proliferative neuroepithelium of the third ventricle  <cit> . cells that produce crh are generated between embryonic  days  <dig> and e <dig>  with the peak generation at e <dig>  da and ss neurons are generated between e <dig> and e <dig>  while the ghrh and trh neurons are generated between e <dig> and e <dig>  with the peak generation at e <dig> and e <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

an interesting observation is that subpopulations of neuroendocrine cells coexisting in the same hypothalamic nucleus produce different neuropeptides   <cit> . the distinct neurotransmitter phenotypes do not differ in time of generation and may appear in response to individual differentiation programs involving specific gene networks, as demonstrated for serotoninergic, noradrenergic or dopaminergic phenotypes  <cit> .

the development of the central nervous system  is achieved through a delicate balance between cell proliferation, subsequent cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation to distinctive neuronal phenotypes. recent observations have highlighted that both extracellular cues  and intracellular signals  play pivotal roles in this process  <cit> . in addition, post-translational histone and/or dna enzymatic modifications, collectively called epigenetic gene regulation, also govern the process of neurogenesis  <cit> .

in vivo models provide evidence that several transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix, homeobox and pou domain families determine the proper establishment and maturation of various neuronal phenotypes within the hypothalamic nuclei  <cit> . in spite of these observations, the inductive signals and final targets of these transcription factors are poorly characterized.

our group has previously demonstrated that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor  increases hypothalamic trh mrna expression in rat e <dig> primary cultures. the bdnf effect is only observed in a population of trh neurons that express the catalytic isoform of the bdnf receptor, trkb  <cit> . in vivo studies have also demonstrated that the expression of the trkb receptor precedes chronologically that of trh in the paraventricular nucleus  of the rat hypothalamus; the effect of bdnf on trh mrna expression can also be observed in primary cultures of pvn neurons  <cit> . bdnf likely regulates the acquisition and/or maintenance of this phenotype during development. to gain a better understanding of the genes that control differentiation of a specific phenotype in the hypothalamic neurons, we performed a genome-wide study to characterize the transcriptome of hypothalamic trh neurons during the terminal phase of differentiation. this represented a challenge since the hypothalamic trh cells constitute only about 2% of the total cell population. to address this issue, we took advantage of the fact that the -774/+ <dig> bp regulatory region of the trh promoter confers tissue specific expression  <cit>  and allows expression of the green fluorescent protein  in the trh expressing cells. purification of the trh cell population was performed by fluorescence activated cell sorting  as described previously  <cit> .

in this report, we show that hypothalamic trh neurons undergoing the terminal phase of differentiation, expressed genes implicated in protein biosynthesis, intracellular signaling, and transcriptional regulation. among the transcripts enriched in the trh neurons, we identified three potentially relevant transcription factors: the krüppel-like factor  <dig> , the transforming growth factor beta  inducible early growth response factor , also known as tieg <dig>  and the activating transcription factor  <dig> . to our knowledge, this is the first report identifying these transcription factors during hypothalamic development. current experiments in our group have shown that klf <dig> and klf <dig> regulate trh gene expression. we provide a molecular toolkit via a compendium of expression data that can help unravel mechanisms of hypothalamic trh neuron development.

RESULTS
enrichment of embryonic hypothalamic trh neurons
to obtain information about the transcriptome of developing trh expressing cells, we induced gfp expression in trh neurons using transfected primary hypothalamic cultures derived from rat embryos of  <dig> days of gestation. this stage corresponds to the terminal phase of differentiation of the trh phenotype in the hypothalamus  <cit> . trh neurons were enriched by facs. the transcriptome of the trh neurons and hypothalamic cells was determined by dna microarray technology .

we have previously reported the conditions to efficiently transfect trh neurons in serum-supplemented cultures; control experiments suggested that most gfp+ cells were trh neurons  <cit> . taking advantage of these conditions, we transfected e <dig> hypothalamic cultures with a gfp expression vector under the control of the minimal trh promoter region  and determined the transfection efficiency by facs. after  <dig> h of transfection,  <dig> % of cells were gfp+ . preparative cell sorting followed by facs analysis of the gfp+ cell population demonstrated a strong enrichment with approximately 94% of cells being gfp+ . in general, cell viability was higher than 90% in all conditions examined as determined by propidium iodide  staining .

to corroborate the neuronal identity of the sorted gfp+ cell population, the expression of trh together with cell-type specific markers was examined by rt-pcr assays. gfp+ cells were separated from the gfp- cells by facs  <dig> h after transfection. as a control, a mixed cell population consisting of gfp+ and gfp- cells was obtained from sorted transfected cultures without selection , whereas non-transfected cells   were used to establish the basal levels of mrna expression. an increase in trh mrna levels was observed in the gfp+ cells compared with nt cells; this was also evident with respect to gfp+/- cells . the increased trh expression in the isolated gfp+ cells correlated with an increase in the expression of the neuronal marker tau, whereas the expression of the glial cell marker gfap diminished . as expected, gfp mrna was present only in the gfp+ and gfp+/- samples . these data, together with our previous report  <cit> , indicate that the sorting conditions permitted the enrichment of trh neurons from a mixed primary cell culture using gfp expression as a marker of trh proximal promoter activity.

dna microarray analysis of trh neurons and hypothalamic cells
once we corroborated that trh cells were enriched in the gfp+ cell population, total rna from gfp+ cells was isolated from a pool of six independent experiments. a pool from three other independent experiments was used to isolate total rna from gfp+/- and nt cells. these rna preparations were used to synthesize biotinylated crna targets and to screen u34a dna microarrays.

in the array-screening experiment, two separate aliquots of gfp+ and gfp+/-rnas, and a single one for nt rna were used. target generated from each aliquot was hybridized to an array, generating single  and replicate  datasets. within the rat u34a oligonucleotide microarray, we distinguished genes based on whether or not they had a well-characterized gene name in the genbank database.  <dig> probe sets were known genes and  <dig> probe sets did not have an assigned gene symbol ; the total number of transcripts analyzed was  <dig> .

analysis of the signal intensity with the microarray suite   <dig>  software  provides a statistical mean to determine the presence or absence of a gene in a sample. this test is based on the comparison of the hybridization efficiency of the target to its complementary sequence with the cross-hybridization of the target to a mismatch sequence identical to the complementary sequence except for one base. each gene is represented by  <dig> probe pairs, with one of the members of each pair containing one mismatch, selected from distinct regions of the gene. the signal values from these probes were used to determine the presence of a gene in the target and a p value calculated from these data. a p value of less than  <dig>  was used as a cutoff to consider that a transcript was present and a p value above this threshold indicated that it was absent. transcripts were considered significantly present or absent based on the following criteria: a) the normalized value from mean differences was higher than the microarray background and, b) the fold change between match and mismatch signals was higher than  <dig> 

on the basis of this analysis, the percentage of transcripts present in the gfp+ and gfp+/- populations was very similar. in the gfp+ cell population, 41%  of the genes represented on the microarray were present, whereas 59%  were absent . in the gfp+/- cell population, 41% of the genes  were present and 59%  were absent. in the nt cell population, 42%  of the genes were present and 58%  were absent.

enriched transcripts in the trh neurons
to identify the set of enriched transcripts in the gfp+ population, we selected genes with a significant level of differential expression. this involved first grouping the two replicates of the control  as well as that of the sorted sample's  expression data. signal intensities of the two replicates of control and sorted datasets were averaged to represent the expression level of a transcript in the respective control and sorted populations. these averaged intensities were used to calculate the fold enrichment in expression in sorted sample over the control for each transcript. a threshold of more than  <dig> fold increase or decrease in expression was considered significant to identify transcripts which are enriched in one sample but underrepresented in the other .

this analysis revealed that  <dig> transcripts were enriched in the gfp+ cells . as expected, of the  <dig> transcripts enriched, we identified some transcripts previously associated with a neuronal phenotype, like the neurofilament heavy chain polypeptide   <cit> , a voltage-dependent calcium channel  <cit> , and a nicotinic alpha-receptor subunit  <cit> . three of the enriched transcripts corresponded to novel transcripts within the developing hypothalamus, the krüppel-like  <dig> transcription factor , the tgfβ-inducible early growth response transcription factor , also known as tieg <dig>  and the activator of transcription factor  <dig> . in addition, a transcript up-regulated by vitamin d <dig>  was enriched in the trh/gfp+ cell population, suggesting a potential physiological role of this vitamin within the hypothalamic trh neurons, in agreement with previously reported data  <cit> .

on the other hand, we found that some of the transcripts diminished in trh/gfp+ cells  were associated with the glial cell phenotype. among them are the collagen type i and type iii   <cit> , and the follistatin-like gene, highly expressed in astroglial cells  <cit> . we also identified transcripts associated with cell cycle regulation, like annexin i, which negatively regulates cyclin d <dig> gene expression  <cit>  .

we then decreased the microarray threshold to  <dig>  fold change to determine if any missing classes of genes can be identified in the different cell populations. we used a heat map presentation and the gene expression profile to establish a hierarchical map based on the similarity of the gene expression values. the first scale, which is associated with a coloured strap, refers to genes with up-regulated  or down-regulated  expression levels in each cell population . the second scale represents the degree of regulation similarity among the genes. a value of zero indicates that the transcripts have the same regulation profile. figure  <dig> shows part of the transcripts identified in each cell population. this analysis confirmed the enrichment of various transcripts  in the gfp+ cells.

to validate the microarray data, we performed rt-pcr analyses for some of the transcripts presumably enriched in the gfp+ cell population. the levels of mrnas for nefh, vdup <dig>  and klf <dig> were increased in the purified population when compared to the nt or gfp+/- cell populations . on the contrary, the glial phenotype associated transcripts, gafp and col3a, were absent in the gfp+ cell population . these results confirmed our microarray data.

transcripts unique to the trh neurons
to further breakdown the microarray data, a second method of analysis of the original signal intensities derived from the mas software analysis was performed using a stringent p-value. this approach allowed us to identify transcripts present in the different cell populations with a high degree of certainty. using a p value of <  <dig> , we identified a total of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts whose presence in the two gfp+/-replicates was significant. similarly, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts in the replicate samples for the gfp+ cell population. in the nt cell population, we identified  <dig> transcripts.

in order to identify the transcripts that were present in both replicates and to reduce the false positive rate in the detection of expressed transcripts, we defined the representative set of each sample as that containing transcripts significantly expressed in both replicates according to the p <  <dig>  threshold. this resulted in  <dig>  transcripts as representative of the gfp+ cell population  and  <dig> transcripts for the gfp+/- cell population. as shown in figure  <dig>  the overlap between the three cell populations indicates that  <dig> transcripts were common to the three populations, whereas  <dig> transcripts were common to the gfp+ and gfp+/- cell populations but not expressed in the nt cell population. this comparison also shows that  <dig> transcripts were unique to the gfp+/- cell population, while  <dig> transcripts were unique to the gfp+ cell population at these thresholds. it should be noted that in this context unique transcripts refer to those transcripts that are uniquely detected in one or more populations shown in the venn diagram, as they are likely to be expressed in undetectable levels at these thresholds in other compared populations. according to their genbank annotations, several of these  <dig> transcripts  are related to neuronal phenotype, e.g. synaptojanin  <dig> ; to translation machinery, e.g. eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit  <dig> , ribosomal protein l <dig> ; to basal metabolic machinery, e.g. acyl-coa synthetase long-chain family member  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> ; to cell signaling, e.g. the serine-threonine kinase  <dig> ; in addition, transcripts encoding proteins with rna-processing properties were also observed, i.e. the nuclear transcription factor y gamma , the splicing factor arginine/serine-rich  <dig>  and the y box protein  <dig> . transcripts related to cns development were also identified, i.e. neurofilament heavy chain polypeptide , and the nuclear factor i/b . a transcript with chromatin remodeling properties, the transformation/transcription domain-associated protein  was also identified . these transcripts may play a critical role in the fetal development of hypothalamic trh neurons.

discussion
events occurring during development are tightly coupled to gene expression regulation. some specific genes have been related to the establishment of neuronal phenotypes within the hypothalamic area. particularly, the transcription factors otp, sim <dig>  sim <dig>  as well as brn <dig> have important roles in hypothalamic architecture . the absence of either of these transcription factors during embryonic development leads to anatomical and molecular hypothalamic impairment and consequently, to the complete lack of expression of specific hypothalamic peptides  <cit> . however, the signalling pathways regulating the activity of these transcription factors and their target genes have not been established. to obtain some insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating trh expression and/or trh neuron growth during development, we determined elements of the gene expression profile of fetal hypothalamic cells enriched in trh neurons using the dna microarray technology. our approach does not necessarily identify genes relevant for birth or migration, but should capture genes important for late developmental events involving trh neuron specification and function. here, we report that facs enriched trh neurons, previously cultured for  <dig> div, can be successfully used to characterize elements of their transcriptome. the database generated from this analysis allowed us to identify some transcripts, including several transcription factors, as novel candidates to regulate hypothalamic trh gene expression or trh neuron growth during the terminal phase of development. among the transcripts enriched in the gfp+ cells, we identified three transcription factors whose expression has not been previously reported within the hypothalamus in vivo. these transcripts include the zinc finger domain-containing transcription factor klf <dig>  <cit> , the tgfβ-inducible early growth response transcription factor   <cit> , and the activating transcription factor  <dig>   <cit> ; these are important regulators of cell differentiation and proliferation in different systems. recently, these transcription factors have been identified as ngf-responsive immediate early genes during pc <dig> cell differentiation  <cit> .

experiments performed in our group have corroborated the relevance of klf <dig> for trh gene expression. klf <dig> mrna is expressed in the embryonic rat hypothalamus, coincident with the establishment of the trh phenotype; in the neonatal rat hypothalamus, klf <dig> is expressed in the pvn, the source of hypophysiotropic trh. klf <dig> binds to the trh promoter either in vitro or in vivo during fetal hypothalamic development. in addition, klf <dig> regulates hypothalamic trh promoter activity both in vitro and in vivo during development. accordingly, trh expression is down-regulated at e <dig> in the hypothalamus of klf <dig> deficient mice, resulting in diminished bioactive peptide level. these data demonstrate that klf <dig> is a key molecule within the differentiation program of the hypothalamic trh phenotype  <cit> .

trh/gfp+ cells are enriched with another member of the krüppel-like family of transcription factors, klf <dig>  experimental evidences show that klf <dig> is a positive regulator of trh promoter activity in primary cultures of fetal hypothalamic cells and that its expression coincides with the establishment of the hypothalamic trh neurons in vivo  <cit> . klf <dig> binds to the trh promoter in vivo during hypothalamus development .

previous reports have demonstrated that klf <dig>  klf <dig> and atf <dig> expression is regulated by tgfβ  <cit> . since tgfβ isoforms and their receptors are expressed in the hypothalamus  <cit> , we have analyzed the effect of this cytokine in primary hypothalamic cultures. tgfβ- <dig> increased trh mrna expression by regulating trh promoter activity  <cit> . furthermore, tgfβ- <dig> induced klf <dig> mrna in primary hypothalamic cultures similarly to trh mrna. finally, klf <dig> was bound to the rat trh promoter in response to tgfβ in vitro . therefore, another of the transcription factors identified in the microarray screening appears critical for trh expression.

in this study, we used independent preparations of gfp+ cells that were pooled to identify transcripts enriched in trh neurons. using independent preparations of gfp+ cells not only decreases the false positives that are possibly identified if only one preparation is used but also enriches the relative concentration of the trh neuron specific transcripts compared to the background sample. experimental designs using pooling samples are often performed to reduce the effects of biological variation, making substantive differences easier to find. consequently, pooling samples has been used in many genome-wide-based studies to provide an accurate and reliable estimate of specific gene expression patterns, dna methylation profiling, identifying biomarkers, etc. in a specific cell population  <cit> . whether all the transcripts identified in this study are truly enriched in trh hypothalamic neurons in vivo, and whether they are expressed into functional proteins, is not yet known, except for the evidence mentioned above for two transcripts. under our experimental conditions, trh neurons passed through a stage of differentiation in vitro; thus, the procedure used in the present study might have altered some aspects of the expression profile of the neurons, leading to some false positives. however, the results obtained with klf <dig> and klf <dig>  suggest that our data should be a useful guide to study trh neuron differentiation. however, since trh neurons are localized in various hypothalamic nuclei  <cit> , each identified transcript may be either enriched in a specific trh neuron type, or in multiple types.

previous studies have indicated that each neuronal phenotype possesses a specific differentiation program, in which in addition to transcription factors  <cit> , epigenetic modifications and non-coding rna expression play pivotal roles. the analysis of the transcriptome of hypothalamic trh neurons allowed us to derive experimental data that indicate that klf <dig> and klf <dig> are important regulators of trh gene expression during the hypothalamus development. co-activators, such as the histone acetyltransferases , or co-repressors, such as histone deacetylases , can regulate klf <dig> and klf <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . therefore, we propose that during hypothalamic development trh gene expression is regulated by extracellular signals  that modulate the accessibility of specific transcription factors  to trh gene promoter by local histone modifications. to gain further insight into the molecular mechanism regulating hypothalamic neuronal phenotype differentiation, it will be critical to determine the impact of specific epigenetic modifications during hypothalamus development.

CONCLUSIONS
although the functional importance of the hypothalamus has been demonstrated throughout vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms controlling neurogenesis in this forebrain structure are poorly understood. the hypothalamic trh peptide has multiple hormonal and autonomous functions. previous studies have evidenced that pituitary response to trh is blunted in a number of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, alcoholism and depression  <cit> . whether specific abnormalities during the differentiation of hypothalamic trh neurons are associated with such disorders remains unknown. therefore, knowledge of transcriptional regulation during the course of trh neuron differentiation might contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying trh mediated homeostasis in the adult organism. for this purpose, we performed a genome wide study of hypothalamic trh neurons during late fetal development. we report novel transcripts within the hypothalamus that may be part of the differentiation program of the trh neuronal phenotype. these included the transcription factors klf <dig>  klf <dig> and atf <dig>  although the role of transcription factors during neuronal differentiation is well accepted, we are only at the brink of understanding how epigenetic mechanisms influence transcriptional activity and the accessibility of transcription factors to bind to cis-elements. the identification of transcripts enriched in fetal hypothalamic trh neurons will guide further studies on the differentiation of this phenotype.
