BACKGROUND
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , or prion diseases, are fatal neurological disorders of humans and other mammals that are characterized by accumulation of an abnormal, protease-resistant isoform of the prion protein  in the brain. in cattle, the largest disease outbreak was first recognized in  <dig> in great britain and peaked in the early 1990's when the number of confirmed bovine spongiform encephalopathy  cases rose to more than  <dig>  per year  <cit> . during this time, bse transmission among cattle was caused primarily by feeding meat and bone meal derived from other bse-affected cattle  <cit> . this so-called classical, or orally acquired bse has since been identified in  <dig> additional countries around the world  <cit> . consumption of beef from bse-affected animals was implicated as the most likely cause of one human prion disease, variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease   <cit> . however, after regulations were implemented to prevent bse-contaminated tissues from entering the animal feed supplies and active bse surveillance was increased, the number of bse cases dropped dramatically  <cit> . this was followed by a corresponding reduction in vcjd cases  <cit> .

an important outcome of intensive worldwide bse surveillance has been the detection of atypical bse in cattle. atypical bse cases may be distinguished from classical bse by differences in: 1) distribution in the central nervous system, 2) molecular typing profile of prptse by western blot, 3) distribution of cases over time, and 4) outcomes of transmission studies in animal models  <cit> . a striking feature of atypical bse cases is their advanced age at time of detection. for example, the average age of atypical bse cases is  <dig> years at the time of detection, compared to an average of  <dig> years for orally acquired bse cases  <cit> . although few atypical bse cases have been identified worldwide , they are significant because of their possible link to sporadic cjd in humans   <cit> .

recent evidence suggests that specific bovine prion protein gene  variants may represent genetic risk factors for atypical bse in older cattle. the first of two indigenous u.s. bse cases  was found to be homozygous for a particular prnp haplotype associated with atypical bse  <cit> . the second bse case  had a previously unidentified, non-synonymous e211k mutation in the prnp coding sequence . genetic risk factors for tse diseases are well known in human populations where more than  <dig> pathogenic prnp mutations have been discovered in families with inherited prion diseases  <cit> . these are transmitted as autosomal dominant disorders and include familial cjd, gerstmann-sträussler-scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia. because both indigenous u.s. bse cases have arisen without any known exposure to other infectious prion agents, the possibility remains that they represent a type of inherited bse that occurs in older cattle with certain prnp haplotypes.

the discovery of a prnp e211k variant in an atypical bse case is particularly remarkable because it is analogous to the most common pathogenic mutation in humans  which causes hereditary cjd . in the human e200k mutation, the normal glutamate  codon gag is replaced by a lysine  codon aag. first reported in  <dig>  this human g to a transition at codon  <dig> has arisen independently at least four times in human history  <cit> . the alabama atypical bse case had a normal gaa  and a novel aaa  codon at position  <dig> in the prion gene . investigators have not been able to identify the source of this apparent bovine g to a transition or the affected cow's herd of origin  <cit> .

knowledge of the distribution and frequency of prnp e211k variants in cattle populations is critical for understanding and managing atypical bse. the k <dig> allele had not previously been observed in a diverse sample of  <dig> full blood u.s. beef and dairy cattle  <cit> . however, it was not known whether the k <dig> allele was prevalent at a low frequency in commercially-produced crossbred cattle or was detectable in a more extensive sample of purebred cattle. to evaluate these possibilities, cattle from u.s. beef processing plants and registered purebred animals were genotyped at the prnp locus. the present report describes a matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry  genotype assay for accurate high-throughput scoring of the prnp e211k variant and its use to determine an upper limit for the k <dig> allele prevalence in u.s. cattle.

RESULTS
scoring haplotypes and diplotypes of prnp codons  <dig> and 211
the position of the e211k mutation is adjacent to that of a synonymous c/t polymorphism in codon  <dig>  thus it may be possible to observe four haplotype combinations of prnp codons  <dig> and  <dig> . moreover, ten diplotypes are possible when all paired combinations of four haplotypes are considered. to account for these ten possible paired haplotype combinations, homogeneous mass extension  reactions were designed to generate both the sense and antisense allele-specific extension products with unique molecular masses . because most of the ten diplotypes had not been identified in cattle and thus could not be used as dna controls, double-stranded synthetic dna controls  were used in their place . maldi-tof ms analysis of the resulting extension products showed that the alleles were sufficiently resolved for accurate diplotype assignment . importantly, all possible k <dig> alleles were well resolved in both the sense and the antisense reactions, providing internal confirmation of the presence of any potential k <dig> allele. the predicted relative positions of all four haplotype alleles in their ten paired combinations are shown graphically in additional file  <dig>  these assays and their synthetic dna controls provide the basis for accurate, high-throughput screening in cattle.

the prevalence of prnp k <dig> allele in u.s. cattle
because the alabama bse case was reported to be a "deep red, crossbred beef cow...possibly crossed with a santa gertrudis or similar breed"  <cit> , additional emphasis was placed on collecting cattle with bos indicus germplasm. the brahman, nelore, and mini-zebu breeds sampled are expected to contain the most bos indicus germplasm, whereas the brangus, beefmaster, santa gertrudis, brahmousin, and senepol breeds are composite breeds with both bos indicus and bos taurus germplasm. approximately 48% of the cattle samples from processing plants were from lots where the average bos indicus germplasm composition of animals was estimated by observers to be more than 50%. of the registered purebred sires and dams tested, about 30%  were bos indicus or composites thereof. the k <dig> allele was not detected in any of the  <dig> cattle tested, including those from five commercial beef processing plants in three states  and  <dig> registered cattle from  <dig> breeds . maldi-tof ms diplotypes were unambiguously inferred for all  <dig> cattle genomic dnas and fell into three classes: ce211/ce <dig>  ce211/te <dig>  and te211/te <dig>  a fourth diplotype, ce211/ck <dig>  was observed when recombinant cdna from the alabama bse case was used to reconstitute its diplotype . the upper bounds for prevalence of prnp k <dig> was estimated to be less than  <dig> in  <dig> cattle based on the 95% quantile of a beta posterior distribution conditional on the observation of  <dig> diverse u.s. cattle without any prnp k <dig> alleles and a conservative uniform prior distribution . changing the two non-negative shape parameters, alpha and beta, to that of a more realistic but less conservative probability density function  did not affect the outcome.

additional unrecognized prnp sequence variation in u.s. cattle
because unrecognized dna sequence variation near prnp codon  <dig> may interfere with genotype scoring, it was important to sequence the complete prnp coding sequence in diverse sires and dams from purebred collections. analysis of prnp coding sequences from more than  <dig> diverse purebred cattle from  <dig> breeds identified three previously unreported polymorphisms. all three single nucleotide polymorphisms  were in intron  <dig> at - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> bp upstream of the prnp start codon, respectively . a single guernsey was heterozygous for the snp at - <dig>  whereas two brangus and one brahmousin were heterozygous for the snp at - <dig>  a number of beefmaster and brahman animals contained the minor allele for the snp at - <dig>  however, neither of these three snps nor the  <dig> other known polymorphisms in this region interfered with scoring e <dig> or k <dig> alleles. in addition, 100% of the genotypes from codons  <dig> and  <dig> were concordant with those from the maldi-tof ms assays . the bovine prnp sequence variants, breed-based allele frequencies, animal genotypes, and electropherograms are publicly available  <cit> .

discussion
bovine carriers of the prnp k <dig> allele may be at risk for developing atypical bse without exposure to other infectious prion agents . the present study describes a maldi-tof ms assay and synthetic dna controls that facilitate screening large numbers of cattle for the k <dig> allele. our aim was to find the k <dig> allele – if possible. consequently, the sampling strategy for commercial and purebred sources was intentionally biased towards bos indicus germplasm because the alabama bse case was reported to be of this type. the bos indicus germplasm samples included more than  <dig> full blood and purebred animals from bos indicus and bos indicus composite breeds. moreover, a large sampling of texas beef processing plants increased this bos indicus bias. another intentional sampling bias was selecting more than  <dig> diverse elite registered full blood animals from  <dig> breeds. the top  <dig> of these breeds represent greater than 99% of the cattle germplasm used in the u.s., based on the number of their registered progeny  <cit> . because the germplasm of elite full blood animals is the foundation of seed stock and commercial cattle in the u.s., it represents a more thorough sampling of u.s. bovine germplasm than a random sample. in spite of the biased sampling, k <dig> carriers were not detected in any cattle tested. these results indicate, like atypical bse, the prnp k <dig> allele is vanishingly rare among u.s. cattle.

the origin of the k <dig> allele from the alabama bse case remains unknown. none of its ancestors were traceable and thus they were not available for testing  <cit> . the question remains, what was the origin of this prnp k <dig> allele? possibilities include: 1) it was a mutation that arose independently in early embryonic development of the  <dig> alabama bse case, 2) it was a mutation that arose independently in a gamete of one of its parents, 3) it was a mutation that arose recently in a line of cattle whose descendants include the alabama bse case, or 4) it was an allele present in a population or breed not tested. given the apparent scarcity of carriers in the u.s. cattle population, strategies for identifying k <dig> carriers might include sampling cattle from geographic areas relevant to the alabama bse case and the continued sampling of diverse purebred sires and dams from previously untested breeds. regardless of the origin of the prnp k <dig> allele from the alabama bse case, there is always a remote chance that a new k <dig> mutation may arise independently in any calf.

in spite of the homology with the pathogenic k <dig> allele in humans, the functional significance of the k <dig> allele from the alabama bse case remains unknown. a high-throughput dna test will be essential for identifying carriers needed for future studies designed to test the influence of prnp k <dig> on development of atypical bse. a 2006-born heifer calf from the alabama bse case is the only known living descendent; however its prnp codon  <dig> genotype has not yet been reported. of the  <dig> or so atypical bse cases reported around the world, only the alabama atypical bse case has been reported to have a k <dig> allele . thus, if additional research shows that the k <dig> allele causes atypical bse, it would not be the only cause. a recent report showed that five of six other atypical bse cases shared a relatively uncommon haplotype that is distinct from those of the alabama bse case  <cit> . regardless of the type, identifying undesirable bovine prnp alleles provides the opportunity to manage them before they cause disease.

CONCLUSIONS
no groups or breeds of u.s. cattle are presently known to harbor the prnp k <dig> variant. because a carrier was not detected, the number of additional atypical bse cases with k <dig> will also be vanishingly low.
