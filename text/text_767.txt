BACKGROUND
fusarium virguliforme , causal agent of soybean  sudden death syndrome , first caused a significant disease loss in  <dig>  <cit> . f. virguliforme was not prevalent in asia by  <dig> but had spread quickly across the americas from about 1980– <dig>  sds has become a major pest problem for soybean growers and breeders in the americas  <cit> . the origins of the disease remain unclear but f. virguliforme may be a new pathogen of soybean since no complete resistance has been reported.

f. virguliforme, like many plant pathogenic fusaria, were facultative hemi-biotrophic pathogens of plant roots with many host species  <cit> . however, only soybean among known hosts showed the leaf scorch when infected by f. virguliforme. soybean cultivars showed a wide range of susceptibility to both leaf scorch and root rot suggesting cultivar-specific partial resistance existed  <cit> f. virguliforme appeared to be a clonal pathogen  <cit> . there were some variations in aggressiveness among field isolates and maintained strains but there were no races reported, by  <dig> 

soybean resistance to sds was multi-geneic and had two components; a partial resistance to root infection and rot caused directly at the site of infection by the fungus; and a partial resistance to leaf scorch caused indirectly by translocated fungal toxins  <cit> . the bases of resistance might include resistances to one or more toxins  <cit> ; and both local and systemic resistances following pathogen recognition  <cit> .

heterodera glycines i., the soybean cyst nematode  was probably an ancient pest of soybean since complete resistances to some hg types of scn was found in about 1% of pre-domesticated and early domesticated plant introductions   <cit> . interestingly most of these pis were also partially resistant to sds  <cit> . one locus, the rfs2/rhg <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig>  was shown to underlie coinheritance of resistance to sds in the roots and also reduce root infestation by scn  <cit> . fine map development did not resolve rfs <dig> from rhg <dig> suggesting the underlying gene were either very closely linked or pleiotropic  <cit> .

rfs <dig> underlay partial resistance to the spread of root infections by f. virguliforme  <cit> . the site of infection did not rot as rapidly when this allele was present and rates of root growth nearly equal to non-infested plants were maintained. toxin translocation to leaves appeared reduced because leaf scorches did not develop or were less severe. the sudden plant death characteristic of sds was manifested as both early senescence and an unusual abscission, basal to the leaflets instead of the petiole. neither occurred if the rfs <dig> allele was present.

equally the rhg <dig> locus underlay partial resistance to scn  <cit> . h.glycines, like many plant parasitic nematodes, were obligate endoparasites of plant roots. like f. virguliformeh. glycines has many alternate hosts. over the past 50 years, the number of hg types  has expanded from  <dig> in the 1960’s to 16– <dig>  <cit> . however, the rhg <dig> locus was constant, being required for partial resistance to all hg types in most pis and cultivars. full resistance to scn required 1– <dig> loci in addition to rhg <dig>  the number depending on the nature of the cyst population parasitizing the roots  <cit> . genetic diversity was found among scn isolates, even inbred cyst populations like pa <dig>  hg type  <dig>  <cit> . further, variation among the host plant roots response to scn has been associated with temperature  <cit>  such that environmental conditions must be rigorously controlled during assays  <cit> .

the resistance or susceptible interaction between the nematode and soybean affected by rhg <dig> was not induced until females stopped moving through the roots and established a feeding site comprising several giant cells  <cit> . full resistance to scn, based on the combined action of the genes at rhg <dig> and one or more additional rhg loci, was manifest as; cell wall appositions to surround the feeding site; failure to supply the feeding site a tracheary element; and a necrosis as the feeding site develops. if the resistance allele at rhg <dig> was present normal rates of root growth were slightly depressed but the above ground stunting, yellowing and early senescence did not occur.

inheritance of resistance to scn was first reported in the pi ‘peking’  <cit> . three recessive loci  and a dominant locus  were assigned gene names by parsimony though other dominance models were equally likely. the peking derived resistance alleles of rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> were introgressed into the cv. ‘forrest’  <cit> . in crosses based on forrest and with scn isolate pa <dig> the rhg1-a was shown to be codominant with the susceptibility allele of ‘essex’  and alone capable of providing partial resistance. consequently, the forrest, ‘hartwig’, peking and ‘pi 437654’ allele was renamed to rhg1-a  by the soybean genetics committee.

the rhg <dig> locus was located to a sub-telomeric region of the soybean chromosome  <dig>  by many studies  <cit> . all of these segregating populations that were later tested with f. virguliforme also had an rfs2-like activity against sds  <cit> . however, an rhg1-like locus was found at other locations in a few scn resistant pis, including lg b <dig>   <cit> , mid lgg  <cit>  and lg b <dig>   <cit> . the effects of the rhg1-like loci found at other locations than chromosome  <dig> on resistance to sds were not reported by  <dig> 

it has been shown the resistance allele of rhg1-a/rfs <dig>  was associated with reduced seed yield when scn is not present in the fields  <cit> . that phenomenon might be related to delayed seedling development and stand formation  <cit> . how the root reduction contributes to resistance may involve a locus on chromosome  <dig>  where rzd, an interacting allele needed for resistance to zygote death, was strictly co-inherited in phase with rhg1/rfs2-a  <cit> . therefore, effects on development were predicted for the gene underlying rhg1-a/rfs2-a  <cit> .

fine scale genetic maps and bac based genomic analysis identified a 42 kbp region encompassed in bac b73p <dig> as the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus  <cit> . the region encoded an rlk , a variant laccase  and a predicted na/h ion antiporter . the gmrlk18- <dig> and gmlaccase18- <dig> were expressed in roots, shoots and flowers but not nodules or seeds. the antiporter was not expressed in any organ tested in essex or forrest. however, it might be expressed in flowers and seed at very low abundance  <cit> . many nucleotide differences were found in the region encompassing the gmrlk18- <dig> and gmlaccase18- <dig> genes from fragments of sequences from the resistant allele in forrest compared to susceptible genotypes ‘asgrow 3244’ and ‘williams 82’  <cit> . however, the gmrlk18- <dig> was considered the most likely candidate gene underlying rhg1-a based on fine maps and association analyses.

rlks are part of the eukaryotic tumor necrosis factor beta receptor super-family  <cit> . in plants they represent a major class of resistance genes and also a major class of developmental regulators. the gmrlk18- <dig> gene at rhg1/rfs <dig> had nine alleles recognized among pis and cultivars  <cit> . of those four alleles were associated with partial resistance to scn and five with susceptibility. the second most important resistance allele was from pi <dig> and named rhg1-b because it was recessive and discovered second  <cit> . however, a small scale experiment with rnai to the rlk  at the rhg1-b in transgenic hairy roots did not show a large effect on cyst numbers  <cit> . either dominance or incomplete inhibition of the protein might have occurred. here, additional experiments were undertaken with the gmrlk18- <dig> at rhg1-a in stable transformed soybean lines. here, a molecular basis for resistance to sds and scn was inferred from functional analyses of the rhg1/rfs2-a locus in near isogenic lines  and the forrest allele of the gmrlk18- <dig> gene in transgenic plants.

RESULTS
allelic variations at the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus
the forrest  allele of the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus was analyzed by sequencing the entire bac b73p <dig> to  <dig> fold redundancy . the bac sequence was compared to the sequences of  williams  <dig> whole genome shotgun sequence  <cit>  and a bac contig developed from  ‘asgrow 3244’  <cit>  from the same region. the bac insert encompassed  <dig>  bp that was predicted to encode nine genes comprised of  <dig> exons . the gmrlk18- <dig> was gene  <dig>  the laccase gene  <dig> and the antiporter gene  <dig>  sequences of the resistant and susceptible alleles were colinear with no large  insertions, deletions or inversions. across the entire bac there were  <dig> snps between forrest and the sequences of alleles for susceptibility. snps were found in the promoter and enhancer regions of all  <dig> genes. however there were only  <dig> snps within genes. only  <dig> of the  <dig> caused amino acid changes. there were just  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins changed by those  <dig> snps.

shown are; the gene numbers in the larger sequenced interval; the sequence coordinates from the predicted 5′ translation start to 3′ translation stop; and the presence of ests in genbank  with homology to the predicted genes. marker coordinates are listed. intra-geneic markers were italicized. genes were bold face. marker positions are rounded to nearest 10 bp except for snp markers which were exact. the * indicated the aligned est and mrna were from soybean, glycine max. the plasmid psbhb <dig> encompassed from  <dig> - 40–194 bp in bac 73p <dig> 

there was evidence for a large and highly polymorphic region within the bac . a highly polymorphic region was expected to be a characteristic of the region introgressed into forrest from peking. equally, relatively monomorphic regions were common when comparing sequences of us cultivars  <cit> . in fact, the three alleles  were nearly identical outside the 59 kbp central region. for example the region that encompassed gene  <dig> had just  <dig> snps across  <dig>  kbp among the  <dig> alleles and no alloproteins.

the rlk contained  <dig> of the  <dig> snps in the bac predicted to cause amino acid changes  when comparing forrest allele to williams  <dig> and asgrow  <dig>  however, it contained  <dig> synonymous snps. in comparison the laccase contained  <dig> snps predicted to cause amino acid changes and only one that was synonymous . the antiporter alloproteins contained one non-synonymous and two synonymous snps.

the greater number of differences between alleles of the gmrlk18- <dig> and the other candidate genes was taken as evidence this should be the first gene tested in transgenic plants. the rlk was subcloned on a  <dig>  bp insert for plant transformation  that contained 6 kbp of 5′ sequence,  <dig>  kbp of geneic sequence and 1 kbp of 3′sequence. the 5′ sequence extended to the tata box of the neighboring gene . the region contained  <dig> potential cis-regulatory elements  of 8 bp that were identical to motifs found in the 5′ regions hundreds of plant genes. the four closest to the rlk are shown in figure 1d. only the most distant was polymorphic between cultivars. the forrest allele of this cre was the identical to sequences found 5′ to  <dig>  rice genes and  <dig> arabidopsis genes. there was a 53 bp deletion from forrest  compared to essex, williams  <dig> and asgrow  <dig> in the enhancer region of the gene that was named siuc-indel- +  <dig> . there was also a 22 bp deletion 3′ to the gene at  named siuc-indel - <dig> . this deletion was within a complex microsatellite repeat mainly composed of aaag motifs. neither deletion appeared to encompass any previously characterized cres. in the intergeneic region between rlk and laccase were four polymorphic small indels or microsatellite-like polymorphisms.

syntenic paralogs of the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus
the soybean genome was hypothesized to be the product of a diploidized tetraploid  <cit> . therefore, a detailed molecular analysis of the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus required that paralogs and syntenic gene clusters be identified. the most identical paralog  was found on bac h38f <dig>  that was from lg b <dig>  in a region where loci with functions similar to rhg1/rfs <dig> were mapped  <cit> . significantly, the sequence of h38f <dig> contained a complete set of syntenic genes for a second rhg1/rfs <dig> locus and surrounding genes . interrogation of soybase showed the transcript abundance patterns for the syntenic rlk pair and laccase pair were both abundant in roots as reported in the rna sequence atlas generated from a williams  <dig> sister line derived nil  backcrossed into g. max   <cit> . the laccase transcripts were  <dig> fold more than either of the rlk transcripts in roots. though it must be noted this genotype was either the rhg1-d or rhg1-e allele.

comparing the syntenic bacs the dna sequence identity was high . at the rlks, gmrlk18- <dig> and gmrlk11- <dig>  with intron boundaries as described by  <cit>  and  <cit> , the amino acid identity was 93% overall with 94% in the lrr, 93% in the trans-membrane domain and 97% in the kinase domain . the n terminal signal peptide was most divergent . the laccase and the antiporter also showed 85–96% amino acid identity with their syntenic paralogs.

gmrlk11-1’s amino acid sequence was less identical to gmrlk18- <dig> than the alleles  of the gene. however, four of the six residues that differ among alloproteins of gmrlk18- <dig> were identical to the forrest allele in the homeologous protein gmrlk11-1-a. at the other  <dig> residues the changes were identical to the susceptible alleles of essex and williams  <dig>  from sequence comparison and transcript abundances it appears likely the paralogs gmrlk18- <dig> and gmrlk11- <dig> would share functions and should hetero-dimerize  <cit> .

allele and paralog discrimination in nils and transgenic plants
since paralogs with homeolog sequence variants  appeared to exist for each gene in the cluster, it was important to distinguish alleles precisely and separately from their most similar hsvs. in the nil population rlk alleles and hsvs were distinguished using both the siuc-tmd <dig> marker  and snp ala87val from the lrr region by taqman . in genomic dna tmd <dig> distinguished both the peking and peking-like allele of gmrlk18- <dig> from the other  <dig> alleles and the homeologous alleles of gmrlk11- <dig>  to distinguish forrest from both essex and x <dig> the snp probe to ala87val was again used for both genomic dna and cdna.

dominant, recessive or co-dominant nature of rhg1/rfs <dig> in nils
in the nil line 34– <dig> that was heterogenous at the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus, about 12% of plants  were still heterozygous by the f5:7: <dig> . those plants were heterozygous at the tmd <dig> marker because they had not yet been fixed by recombination. the frequency of heterozygous plants among f5:7: <dig> generation seed was surprisingly high  compared to the expected frequencies at the f <dig> , f <dig>  and f <dig>  generations. even calculating the expected heterozygous plant frequency starting from the f <dig> the occurrence was higher than expected . the existence of these plants suggested that fixation by re-assortment was selected against in viable zygotes  or that the heterozygous state was under positive selection. the remaining  <dig> plants  were fixed equally to forrest or essex alleles .

the cyst scores for all plants in the nil population corresponded with the respective alleles at the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus so plants with resistance alleles had female indices  less than 8% and plants with susceptibility alleles had fis greater than 84% . for the four heterozygous plants, polymorphic at tmd <dig>  the cyst scores ranged from 5–12% which corresponded to those for resistant or moderately resistant plants. therefore, the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus was dominant in this set of nils infested with hgtype  <dig> population jb <dig>  however, heterozygous nils were reported co-dominant with hgtype  <dig> population pa <dig> in earlier tests where fis ranged from 5–40%  <cit> . co-dominant and recessive roles of plant disease resistance loci were previously associated with factors needed by the pest for successful parasitism  <cit> . the discrepancies in dominance among different populations may be associated with the genetic background in which the gene resides or may result from interactions among genes at the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus and/or modifier genes at other loci  <cit> .

inhibition of root growth by alleles of rhg1/rfs <dig> in the nils
when counting the cysts with prior knowledge of the allele at rhg1/rfs <dig> in the standard assay of scn it was noted that root mass and vigor appeared to differ among genotypes. measurement of root masses showed a significant difference  among nils that were associated with the allele at rhg1/rfs <dig> . across several experiments, both nils that were susceptible and nils that segregated most susceptible lines had higher root masses  than their scn resistant  or heterozygous  counterparts. this phenomenon might underlie the global association of resistance to scn with low seed germination, seedling vigor and ultimately seed yield noted previously  <cit> . in addition, the lower root growth might provide an avoidance mechanism that is part of a broad resistance effective against all hg types.

the distribution of recombination events found previously among the six hg type  <dig> susceptible pis  <cit>  suggested that the action of rhg1/rfs <dig> required elements to the 3′ side of the rlk intron or in the c terminal portion of the protein. one of the  <dig> amino acid substitutions found in the intracellular kinase of the complete rlk  may be key to transducing intracellular signaling leading to the resistance response  <cit> . some mutations in the kinases of other plant rlks are known to be lethal  <cit> . therefore, it may be the kinase at the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus that underlies restricted root growth in resistant genotypes. the effect may be direct or occur after protein-protein interaction. the signal transduced is likely to result in a negative reponse since the kinase domain lacks the rd amino acid motif needed for atp binding  <cit>  and so protein phosphorylation.

transcripts of the gmrlk18- <dig> alleles at rhg1/rfs <dig> were found in soybean roots
expression judged by examination of est libraries in silico, cdna libraries by hybridization, rna sequencing and mrna populations assayed by qrt-pcr showed both transcripts encoded by gmrlk18-1-a and gmrlk18-1-e alleles  were present in both non-infested roots and scn-infested roots, as reported in  <cit> . the transcript and protein abundances were not increased by more than  <dig> fold in either h. glycines or f. virguliforme infested plants compared to non-infested plants . low transcript and protein abundances appeared to result from largely constitutive expression under the conditions and stages of development tested to date.

analyses of disease responses in plants transgenic with the resistance allele of the gmrlk18- <dig> in the greenhouse
in order to test the hypothesis that gmrlk18-1-a underlay part of the activity of the rhg1/rfs2-a locus susceptible plants were made transgenic with this allele. such plants had a resistance allele at a new location and a susceptibility allele  on chromosome  <dig>  several primary transgenic lines were created by biolistics and fertile lines selected in two different cultivars  for analyses of sds and scn responses.

in several transgenic lines from  used for sds and scn assays, lines were identified with the gmrlk18-1-a transgene in the homozygous state. in these plants the transgenes were both transcribed and translated. for example, in the progeny of fertile t <dig> line 6b <dig> the progeny t <dig> lines like 7d <dig> and sixteen t <dig> derived plants expressed the gmrlk18-1-a transgene as both mrna and protein . expression of the transgene alleles was equal to the endogenous gene alleles as judged by protein abundance. gmrlk <dig> transcripts and proteins were detected in about 50% of the progenies of the 6b <dig> primary transformants. in selfed lines expressing gmrlk18-1-a the transgene allele was detected as distinct mrnas and alloproteins. expression was directed by the native promoter and the enhancer elements contained on the proximal 6 kbp of the  <dig>  kbp fragment of psbhb <dig>  that plasmid was sub-cloned from bac b21d <dig>  during bac sequencing.

in transgenic soybean plants gmrlk18-1-a allele provided resistance to both root infection and root rot by fusarium virguliforme. that root resistance underlay a significant reduction in leaf symptoms and delay of the senescence caused by sds . resistance to sds was effective throughout the life of the plants which flowered and set seed. the non-transgenic x <dig> plants proved to be highly susceptible to sds and showed all the expected phenotypes of root rot and leaf scorch. the phenotypes among the susceptible plants included a gradual worsening of leaf scorch symptoms from  <dig>  at 21 days after infection  to  <dig>  by  <dig> dai. only at near maturity did the susceptible plants showed symptoms characteristic of sds. for example, leaflet abscission occurred from the top of the petiole instead of the base of the petiole. however, the transgenic plants did not show early senescence or reduced pod set. equally, the characteristic root symptoms of sds were very reduced in the rlk transgenic plants. symptoms reduced included the degree of root rot and browning of the root cortex. senescence was delayed by 14 days in gmrlk18- <dig> transgenics compared to controls and more pods were set in each of the three repeats of the experiment. therefore, the gmrlk18-1-a provided a very high degree of resistance to the transgenic plants in roots and leaves and pods.

part a shows scn female index in greenhouse grown seedlings at 28 days after scn infestations. pots were watered daily with 100 ml. female index  was the mean percentage of cysts of hg type  <dig> found on five plants per repetition compared to a susceptible genotype essex. part b shows the effects of the transgene on resistance to f. virguliforme. in greenhouse grown seedlings at 28 days after infestations. pots were saturated with water to the 5 cm level. leaf scorch was recorded as the mean disease severity  measured on a 1– <dig> scale found on five plants per experimental repeat. root rot severity  was measured on a 1– <dig> scale. panel c shows the percent insect incidence, defoliation by herbivorous insects and the consequent loss of biomass at harvest as mean dry weight per plant for field grown plants with  <dig> replications across 2 years.

the results from x <dig> transgenics were comaperd to results from westag <dig> transgenics in the sds assay with infested plants . westag <dig> plant were bigger and more stress resistant than x <dig>  however, the westag plants transgenic with the rlk again proved more significantly more resistant to sds caused by f. virguliforme. therefore, the resistance was not transgenic event or cultivar specific.

in separate assays with plants from the same lines the resistance to scn was partial in the gmrlk18-1-a transgenic plants  judged by female index . partial resistance was expected as rhg4-e was present and rhg4-a absent. scn fi was reduced by 30–50% across four experiments using three hg types . because the x <dig> selfed transgenic plants reported here had a susceptible allele at rhg <dig>  partial resistance was the expected outcome. the partial resistance was confirmed with another isolate of scn at harbin university . a cross was made to the ril ef <dig> via a susceptible nil we <dig>  ef <dig> was rhg1-e/rfs <dig>  rhg1-e/rfs <dig>  rhg <dig>  rhg <dig>  the progeny segregated for the rlk and so were rhg1-e/rfs <dig>  rhg1-e/rfs <dig>  rhg <dig>  rhg4::rlk18- <dig> or rhg1-e/rfs <dig>  rhg1-e/rfs <dig>  rhg <dig>  rhg <dig> with no transgene. plants with the rlk had a 20% lower fi and were almost in the resistant class . again the westag  <dig> plants were tested with the same assay. westag  <dig> appeared to encode a functional rhg <dig> resistance allele. consequently the rlk transgenic westag  <dig> showed nearly complet resistance. therefore, the gmrlk18-1-a was alone sufficient to provide for an rhg1–a like activity at different locations in different cultivars. the linked genes may reduce scn numbers but did require the action of a second locus  to provide full resistance to hg type  <dig> as expected from  <cit> .

analyses of plants transgenic with the resistance allele of the gmrlk18- <dig> in the field
field grown plants showed that the rlk was associated with increased insect herbivory . the primary damaging pest was the japanese beetle . insects were attracted to the rlk transgenic plants judged by pest incidence  measured from r1-r <dig> growth stages. herbivory resulted in plants with less leaf area that produced less shoot biomass at harvest compared to isogenic plants lacking the gmrlk18-a allele. there was no incidence of sds or scn in the field during the  <dig> or  <dig> seasons.

effect of the forrest allele of gmrlk18- <dig> on transgenic plant development
in both scn greenhouse assay and field the forrest allele of gmrlk18- <dig> caused a reduction in root and shoot mass . the reduction was significant even though the x <dig> cultivar was innately smaller than the nils due to a very much earlier maturity date. reductions occurred in seedlings in the scn assay , the sds assay  and whole plants in the field  at harvest maturity. the reduction in growth in the field lead to a reduction in biomass but not seed yield and seed number per plant. mid- to late-season defoliation by insect pests rarely reduces soybean yield. in both scn and field assays plant growth was limited by available water. a reduction in root growth might be related to reduced water uptake.

however, in the water saturated assays of sds resistance the forrest allele of gmrlk18- <dig> caused an increase in root and shoot mass  in the presence of f. virguliforme infestations. the increase in growth lead to a increase in biomass and seed yield  and seed number per plant in plants grown to maturity in the greenhouse . water sufficiency appeared to make the forrest allele of gmrlk18- <dig> beneficial to growth and yield when f. virguliforme was present. in contrast, plants that were not infested in the sds assays showed the forrest allele of gmrlk18- <dig> caused a decrease in root and shoot mass.

discussion
the gmrlk18- <dig> at the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus was shown to underlie resistance to root infection by f. virguliforme and the subsequent leaf scorch, as predicted by  <cit> . some resistance to scn was found but this was partial as expected in the absence of a resistance allele at rhg <dig>  <cit> . the rlk simultaneously contributed resistance to both pathogens, establishing pleiotropy . reduced seedling root growth was part of the resistance mechanism and this may underlie the reduced yield of resistant cultivars  <cit> . in arabidopsis clavata <dig>  the rlk that regulated meristem development, also had an effect on nematode resistance  <cit> .

in field trials of plants transgenic with gmrlk18- <dig> further evidence of pleiotropy was discovered when leaf herbivory was shown to be significantly worsened. insect pests are separated into the chewing and sucking guilds. resistance mechanisms to the guilds were known to operate by different pathways but some involved the rhg <dig> locus or region  <cit> . arabidopsis resistance to f. graminearum was recently shown to require operation of both sa and ja pathways  <cit> . the same nils used here when infested with h. glycines decreased proteins involved in salicylic acid responses and increased those in the jasmonic acid signaling pathways  <cit> . therefore, plants transgenic with gm18rlk18- <dig> might be altered in their responses to a broad range of pests and pathogens. additional pathogens will be tested in future studies.

the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus was shown to center on three genes where recombination was suppressed within a wider region that was high in recombination. perhaps the failure to recombine within the central  <dig> gene cluster caused the unusually high frequency of heterozygous plants in the neighboring region. a potential suppressor locus acting on the resistance allele of rhg <dig> was identified earlier  <cit> . the allele of the gene on chromosome  <dig>  had to be inherited from the resistant parent to prevent zygote or embryo lethality in scn resistant plants. consequently, all resistant plants co-inherited rhg1/rfs <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  and the resistance allele on chromosome  <dig> . that gene may have had a functional homeolog in this study. however, the locus was fixed to the r haplotype in all the nils, so fine mapping was not possible. plant transgenic with the rlk were fertile and produced seed and they would lack the resistance allele of the gene on chromosome  <dig> . therefore, gmrlk18- <dig> does not cause zygote or embryo lethality. additional genetic elements must be involved in that phenomenon.

an absence of recombination events in a region can be caused by; deletions; insertions; inversions; the condensed heterochromatin found near centromeres; and recombinant allele lethality. the first four phenomena were not occurring at the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus since dna sequences in resistant and susceptible cultivars were co-linear over at least 87 kbp. further, the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus mapped into a region within 1 mbp of the predicted telomere region of chromosome  <dig>  therefore, recombinant allele lethality may be the cause and a hypothetical model for its action was developed. the kinase domain of the rlk at rhg1/rfs <dig> was proposed as the element causing lethality to gametes or the zygote carrying a recombination event. the hypothetical anti-porter protein was proposed as the target locus kept in the resistant state when the rlk is conferring scn resistance . the laccase that was located between these two genes, along with the intergenic regions, are held in phase by the locus. it may be possible that the lethal nature of the three genes linked in association at the resistance locus are not fully suppressed by the modifier locus  and results in the inhibition of root growth observed in scn resistant cultivars .

the linkage disequilibrium studies reported with probes in, and around, the rlk inferred a larger more complex structure for rhg <dig> than simply the rlk polymorphisms  <cit> . possible roles included contributions to additive resistance; contributions to resistance in other resistance types  or contributions to the resistance to other hg types. the hypothesis that the linked genes were factors necessary in susceptible genotypes for scn parasitism was unlikely  <cit> . the dominance of rhg1/rfs <dig> to scn in nil segregation also suggested the genes were active in resistant types and inactive in susceptible genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus was shown to include the gmrlk18- <dig>  previously  <cit>  also reported inhibition of the resistance allele increased fi in composite roots, but not to a significant degree in small experiments with few replications. here rhg1/rfs <dig> was inferred to be a complex of three genes assembled and co-inherited over long periods of selection for resistance to a endemic pest, root parasitic nematodes. however, the gmrlk18- <dig> alone at a new genomic locations in transgenic plants was sufficient for resistance to a relatively new pathogen of soybean f. virguliforme. revisions to the sequence of the rlk made by re-sequencing pcr products  <cit>  were confirmed by bac fragment sequencing here. fortunately the amino acid changes made to  <cit>  lay outside of regions under detailed analysis for ligand and antibody binding  <cit> . previously cle peptide in nematode secretions were shown to be perceived by rlks in the clavata <dig>  clavata <dig> and coryne families  <cit> . in vitro, the purified gmrlk18- <dig> lrr domain has been shown to bind strongly to the cle peptide found in nematode secretions as well as two proteins and two cle peptide of plant origin involved in tracheary element inhibition  <cit> . it will be of interest to discover whether the ligand profiles are similar for the two resistances. the biochemical analysis of the rlk protein will lead to refinements of models for modes of action for the pleiotropic resistance.

the allelic discrimination probes developed provide a high throughput alternative to satellite markers for marker assisted selection. these tools will facilitate molecular breeding for resistance to two or more important pests and diseases of soybean  <cit> . the discovery of a syntenic set of paralogs to the rlk, laccase and transporter gene cluster at rhg1/rfs <dig> may also assist marker assisted breeding. the discovery of the syntenic homeologs raised significant barriers to reverse genetic approaches to analyses of the rlk at rhg1/rfs <dig>  another barrier to reverse genetic approaches was the role of rhg1/rfs <dig> in normal plant development that can be inferred from the restricted root growth of nils  and transgenic plants . a third barrier to reverse genetics was the uncoupling in eukaryotes of transcript and protein abundances. both effects may have contributed to the recent report of no significant difference between the scn counts on composite plant roots with the gmrlk18-1-b alone targeted for inhibition  <cit> . it must be noted that the gmrlk18-1-b protein abundance was not measured in that study in spite of the tools available to do so  <cit> . further, note that the numbers of cyst did differ between treatments  <cit>  and that might be significant in larger, replicated studies or under different conditions. further note that allele was recessive. however, further proofs of the nature of rhg1/rfs <dig> locus function may require knock-outs of each of the paralogs, or stable transformation to several new locations, followed by measurements of genetic segregation. in each case, the analysis will be complicated by the co-dominant nature of the resistance gene in certain experiments. in fact, the possibility that the susceptible essex allele of rhg1/rfs <dig> was functional by promoting root growth and susceptibility, and so actively promoted the establishment of parasitism by scn and f. virguliforme, should be explored with transgenic plants. the model inferring that soybean has adapted part of an existing pathogen recognition and defense cascade , to a new pathogen  disease  has broad implications for crop improvement. stable resistance to many pathogens might be achieved by manipulation of the genes encoding a small number of pathogen recognition proteins in the rlk family.
