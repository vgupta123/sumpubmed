BACKGROUND
flesh flies in the genus sarcophaga  have long been important models in insect physiology and biochemistry, particularly with respect to the study of endocrinology  <cit> , diapause  <cit> , cold hardiness  <cit> , reproduction  <cit> , and immunity  <cit> . larvae of sarcophaga flies typically feed on carrion or feces, playing an important ecological role in decomposition and feature prominently in human forensic studies  <cit> . sarcophaga species can cause myiasis in humans and livestock and therefore are of importance to medical and veterinary entomology  <cit> . in addition, sarcophaga flies are natural hosts of the parasitic wasp nasonia vitripennis and are often used in laboratory studies and for wasp culture. nasonia vitripennis parasitizes pupae of many species of higher flies, including house flies and other filth flies, making them economically important for biological control  <cit> . furthermore, n. vitripennis is a popular model for understanding host-parasite relationships, behavioral ecology, development, and evolution, thus offering an impetus for sequencing the genome of this wasp and two congeners n. giraulti and n. longicornis  <cit> .

despite its prominence as a model in several sub-disciplines, there is currently no genome project for any sarcophaga species, and genomic resources are limited. several laboratories have performed low-throughput est projects such as differential display  <cit>  and subtractive hybridization  <cit> , but the mainstay of functional genomic research on species in this genus has focused on homology-based, gene-by-gene cloning. the genomic resources developed for a handful of insects including drosophila, honey bees, mosquitoes, and bombyx mori has prompted much work on these species, pushing our understanding of processes in these few models far ahead of other insects. development of such resources for sarcophaga would greatly benefit the study of flesh flies as has been done with other non-traditional model insects such as polistes wasps  <cit> , glanville fritillary butterflies  <cit> , and tobacco hornworm moths  <cit> .

we describe an est collection developed as a genomic resource for the flesh fly sarcophaga crassipalpis, a model species for studying numerous processes including diapause, reproduction, endocrinology, stress tolerance, and immunity. to facilitate identifying sets of genes involved in a broad range of processes we developed our est set from a normalized whole-body library of numerous s. crassipalpis life stages including diapause-destined and non diapause-destined larvae, diapausing and non-diapausing pupae, and reproductive and non-reproductive adults of both sexes . we confidently identified approximately  <dig>  different transcripts involved in numerous biological processes. within these transcripts, we identified more than  <dig> potential microsatellite loci and over  <dig>  snps that can be used for future population studies. comparison of the distribution of s. crassipalpis unigenes among go biological process functional groups with that of the drosophila melanogaster transcriptome suggests that our ests are broadly representative of the flesh fly transcriptome. combining our data with full transcriptomes from d. melanogaster and a. gambiae, we used a three-species comparison to test whether coding sequences are evolving at similar rates across these go categories.

 flesh fly life stages that were individually rna extracted and combined equally prior to cdna library synthesis and normalization.

RESULTS
our normalized s. crassipaplis library was first subjected to a one-quarter plate titration run on the  <dig> gs-flx machine that yielded  <dig> , <dig> total bases from  <dig>  sequence reads that assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  singletons. of these contigs and singletons  <dig>  were identifiable at an e ≤  <dig>  using blastx against the ncbi non-redundant protein database .

we followed this one-quarter plate preliminary run with a full-plate production run that yielded  <dig> , <dig> total bases from  <dig>  sequence reads and combined the results of both runs into a single dataset which was assembled de novo. files containing our results are available from the national center for biotechnology information short read archive . after filtering adaptors and low-quality sequences  <cit>  we were left with  <dig> , <dig> total bases from  <dig>  sequence reads with an average length of  <dig> bases. these data were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of  <dig> bp and a range of  <dig> to  <dig>  bp as well as an additional  <dig>  singletons for a total of  <dig>  high-quality sequences. a file of all assembled contigs and singletons is available from the authors upon request.

subjecting these sequences to a blastx search against the ncbi-nr protein database yielded  <dig>  well-identified sequences with at least one hit e ≤  <dig>  ,  <dig>  poorly-identified sequences with hits between e =  <dig>  and e =  <dig>  and  <dig>  with no useful hits . subjecting these sequences to a blastn search against the ncbi-nt sequence database yielded  <dig>  well-identified sequences with a hit e ≤  <dig>  ,  <dig>  poorly-identified sequences with hits between e =  <dig>  and e =  <dig>  and  <dig>  with no useful hits . well-identified sequences  from both searches were combined and compared with each other using blastn, reducing the number of well-identified sequences into  <dig>  unique gene elements or unigenes. to estimate how many of these unigenes represented unique transcripts as opposed to different non-contiguous fragments of the same transcript we produced a file of the top  <dig> hits for each unigene and used these lists to compare accession numbers that overlapped among different unigenes with an e< <dig>  using a custom excel macro followed by manual editing. this procedure identified  <dig>  sequences that are likely independent transcripts .

while the ~ <dig>  identified transcripts are certainly less than the entire transcriptome, we acquired many sequences of interest. because our groups, among others, are particularly interested in diapause and stress biology, we compiled a brief list of genes we expect play a role in diapause . clearly, even this abbreviated list will provide fodder for years of functional genomics work on these candidate genes for our group and others.

our major goal was to generate a substantial representative sample of the transcriptome. to assess whether our est project was broadly representative of our expectations for the sarcophaga transcriptome, we used the annotations for each of our contigs and singletons to assign it to one of  <dig> major go categories for biological process, producing assignments for  <dig>  out of a total  <dig>  transcripts . we also compared the distribution of our sequences among these  <dig> go functional groups within biological process to the distribution of the  <dig>  predicted genes for drosophila melanogaster,  <dig>  of which are placed into those same functional groups . although there are noticeable differences between the drosophila and sarcophaga data in the percentage of transcripts within a few sub-categories, concordance in the overall distributions suggests that our library sampled widely across sub-categories and provides a good representation of the s. crassipalpis transcriptome. as sequencing technologies improve, further exploration of the s. crassipalpis transcriptome will likely include sequencing of new libraries made from key tissues during focal life stages that may not have high representation in total body extracts, such as brains from diapausing pupae or ovaries from pre and post-reproductive females, as well as deeper sequencing to both reveal rare transcripts and provide the additional information necessary to identify more of the unannotated transcript fragments in our current whole-body library.

because our est database appears broadly representative of the s. crassipalpis transcriptome, we compared it to the available transcriptomes of d. melanogaster and a. gambiae to assess whether coding sequences were evolving at equivalent rates across go categories. non-synonymous rates of substitution  were roughly gamma-distributed across genes within each go category for all three pairwise comparisons. median values across all go categories were generally lowest in comparisons of s. crassipalpis to d. melanogaster , reflecting their close relationship within cyclorrapha relative to the relatively deep phylogenetic split between cyclorrapha and culicomorpha. the 95% confidence intervals of the median  did not differ substantially across categories within any of the three pairwise comparisons , suggesting largely homogeneous rates of amino acid substitution. however, the median dn for response to stimuli had the highest  or second highest  value in the rank ordering among go categories across all three pairwise comparisons. this consistently high dn across multiple comparisons of species diverged on the order of  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  suggests that genes regulating responses to stimuli may evolve relatively rapidly across dipteran taxa. this divergence meshes well with obvious differences in sensory strategies between these three species that must identify and locate very different nutritional resources . in addition, responses to pheromonal and behavioural cues associated with reproduction vary widely across taxa and are likely under strong diversifying selection.

in addition to the focal animal, transcriptomics projects can also provide insights into parasites, pathogens, and other associated microorganisms. because we used whole organisms grown in non-sterile culture conditions we expected a portion of our library to include microorganismal sequences, some which are directly associated with s. crassipalpis and some that are inadvertent environmental contaminants. we identified only  <dig> non-metazoan sequences that appeared to be independent transcripts with an e< <dig>  from our blastx and blastn searches. although we expect that flesh flies have a rich microorgansimal community, our selection of poly-a rna as the starting material for our library likely eliminated many potential microbial sequences. few hits were ascribed to any single microorganismal taxa. roughly one-third of the sequences had high sequence similarity to various eukaryotic microorganisms including yeasts , filamentous fungi , and protozoans . sequences having apparent bacterial origin included many genera with species that have been associated with insects either as pathogens or as normal flora in the gut , but these sequences could just as easily represent environmental contamination. perhaps most interesting of the non-metazoan sequences were those for transposable elements, particularly sequences in the mariner-tc <dig> family and several retroviral elements. with future development such sequences may provide insight into new functional genomics tools for sarcophaga, potentially including transgenic modification.

another interesting feature of our  <dig> sequence data is that a number of sequences appear to contain repeat motifs  or single nucleotide polymorphisms . we searched for microsatellite motifs within our sequences using the program msatcommander  <cit>  to identify sequences with di-, tri-, tetra-, penta, and hexanucleotide repeats. our search for repeat motifs revealed  <dig> sequences containing some such motif from the total set of  <dig>  sequences . the high levels of variation typically found for microsatellite markers have led to their widespread use for a broad range of studies such as genome mapping, parentage analysis, and analyses of gene flow and genetic structure. because our library was constructed from a long-standing laboratory colony expected to harbor little standing variation compared to field populations, we did not screen any of these loci for allelic variability. similarly, to identify snps in our contigs we used the program polybayesshort, a version of the polybayes program  <cit>  that has been optimized for data from short read platforms such as  <dig>  under the default parameters. we found at total of  <dig>  snps that were distributed among  <dig> of our  <dig>  contigs, yielding an average of  <dig>  snps per  <dig> kb. however, because our samples were derived from a long-standing, inbred laboratory colony our snp estimates are likely a small fraction of the variation existing in s. crassipalpis populations in the field. we hope that identification of candidate microsatellite and snp loci will be useful for others interested in field-based population studies of s. crassipalpis and closely related sarcophaga species, some of which are important for forensic studies.

CONCLUSIONS
studies of flesh flies in the genus sarcophaga have contributed greatly to our understanding of diapause, stress resistance, reproduction, and immunity in insects, but work in this "non-traditional" model organism has been hampered by a lack of genomic resources. our use of pyroseqencing to develop a new est library containing approximately  <dig>  transcripts provides a new resource for innovative work that we hope will draw renewed interest in using flesh flies as a model. we expect that these est data will provide the foundation for a proliferation of functional work on flesh flies including "-omics" approaches such as the development of microarrays for large scale gene expression studies as well as serving as a foundation for identifying previously unrecognizable proteins in proteomics studies. these data will also increase our ability to explore specific gene and pathway-based approaches such as transcript quantification by qrt-pcr and rna interference of candidate genes that have previously been refractory to homology-based cloning. furthermore, these data compliment the growing number of est and genome projects in flies other than drosophila and mosquitoes, such as the medfly ceratitis capitata and the hessian fly mayetiola destructor  <cit> , enhancing resources for comparative studies of molecular evolution across the diptera. our initial comparative analysis of evolutionary rates across go categories illustrates this utility, and we anticipate that similar genome and transcriptome-wide analyses will yield important insights into insect diversification.
