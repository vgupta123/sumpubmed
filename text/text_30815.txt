BACKGROUND
clavibacter is generally considered a genus of plant pathogens, but ecological surveys suggest that environmental, non-pathogenic clavibacter occur more commonly than previously thought  <cit> . generally these non-pathogenic isolates are overlooked since diagnostic procedures focus on pathogenic strains. just recently, studies were undertaken to initiate the characterization of these non-pathogenic isolates  <cit> . the main objective of this study was to investigate key genomic features of non-pathogenic clavibacter isolated from tomato seeds. these strains tend to be misidentified as cmm in serological and molecular tests used in seed assays. their high genetic and phenotypic similarity to pathogenic cmm strains hampers a clear judgment on seed health.

the majority of non-pathogenic clavibacter strains isolated from tomato seeds exhibit similar cell and colony morphology to the genuine cmm  <cit> . because of the common biological origin , high sequence similarities and similar physiological characteristics, the non-pathogenic clavibacter strains are suggested to be the most related to cmm. initial in planta experiments demonstrated that this group of isolates is not pathogenic to the tomato plant and they do not colonize the vascular tissues of tomato  <cit> . non-pathogenic clavibacters neither induce a hypersensitive reaction  after infiltration of nicotiana tabacum and nicotiana benthamiana leaves  <cit> , nor when inoculated to mirabilis jalapa . furthermore, a majority of these strains is lacking one or both cmm plasmids carrying important virulence factors.

so far there is very little information available on non-pathogenic clavibacter strains isolated from tomato seeds. reports concerning the ecological niche, survival abilities or nutritional requirements are lacking. knowledge about the biology of these strains is limited, not only because they were only recently identified as constituting a separate clavibacter group but also because their significance in the cmm identification procedure has not been evaluated previously. their ecological niches remain unknown; routes of transmission and possible sources of these strains have not yet been recognized.

high genetic and phenotypic similarities of non-pathogenic clavibacter and pathogenic cmm strains are the main reasons for their misidentifications as cmm in the currently recommended detection/identification tests for cmm in tomato seeds  <cit> . cross-reactions with antisera specific for cmm and/or positive pcr reactions with primers used for identification of cmm illustrate the proximity of surface antigens and genomic sequences of non-pathogenic seed-borne clavibacter to the pathogenic cmm  <cit> . recent studies demonstrated that neither pcr assays based on commonly used 16s rrna genes or its region, nor those designed for the detection of known virulence factors are specific to only pathogenic cmm  <cit> . furthermore, some non-pathogenic clavibacter strains showed fainter pcr amplicons on the gel impeding the correct interpretation of the results  <cit> . taxonomically, these non-pathogenic clavibacters from tomato seeds are distinct from all clavibacter subspecies   <cit> .

recent developments in the field of molecular biology and sequencing allowed generating complete genome sequences and subsequently determining metabolic traits for many organisms. complete genome sequences of cmm ncppb  <dig>  <cit> , cms atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and cmn ncppb  <dig>  provide genetic information that allows for comparative studies and helps to better understand their pathogenicity characteristics and host adaptation. however, no information is available about the genome content of non-pathogenic clavibacter strains, which could deliver some informative insights into the differences in virulence determinants, genetic content and adaptation to a lifestyle in their natural ecological niche. genome comparison between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains belonging to the same species is an important and valuable approach to identify genes that may contribute to virulence and general fitness of the organism.

in this report we present the genome analysis of non-pathogenic clavibacter lmg  <dig> isolated from tomato seed. the specific purposes of this study were a) to generate a draft genome sequence of this strain, b) to analyze it for virulence-related gene content by comparing it to the available genome of the pathogenic clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis  ncppb  <dig>  c) to perform a comparative analysis with the genomes of cmm   <cit> , clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis   and clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus    <cit> , pathogenic to tomato, maize and potato, respectively, d) to search for adaptations to a non-pathogenic lifestyle.

methods
strains and dna extraction
non-pathogenic clavibacter sp. lmg  <dig> was received as isolate pd  <dig> from naktuinbouw, the netherlands. it was obtained in dilution plating on semi-selective media according to the current method for detection of cmm in tomato seeds recommended by the international seed federation   <cit> . lmg  <dig> is phenotypically similar to cmm on scmf and cmm1t and was identified as cmm in commonly practiced pcr tests but showed no pathogenicity in tomato plants  <cit> . lmg  <dig> was aerobically grown on mtna  medium without antibiotics at 25°c for 24 h-48 h  <cit> . stock cultures were stored at −80˚c in microbanktm beads . total genomic dna was extracted according to the guanidium-thiocyanate-edta-sarkosyl method described by pitcher  <cit> , which was adapted for gram-positive bacteria by a pre-treatment with lysozyme  and incubation for 40 minutes at 37°c.

plasmid extraction
isolation of plasmid dna was based on the alkaline method of anderson and mckay  <cit> . agarose gel electrophoresis was performed in a tris acetate buffer containing 40 mm tris, 20 mm acetic acid, and 2 mm na2edta . gels contained  <dig> % agarose and electrophoresis was performed at 55 v for 16 hrs at 4˚c. gels were stained with ethidium bromide  <dig>  μg/ml.

genome sequencing
library preparation and genome sequencing was performed by baseclear . high-molecular weight genomic dna was used as input for library preparation using the illumina truseq dna library preparation kit . briefly, the gdna was fragmented and subjected to end-repair, a-tailing, ligation of adaptors including sample-specific barcodes and size-selection to obtain a library with median insert-size around 300 bp. after pcr enrichment, the resultant library was checked on a bioanalyzer  and quantified. the libraries were multiplexed, clustered, and sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> with paired-end 50 cycles protocol. the sequencing run was analyzed with the illumina casava pipeline . the raw sequencing data produced was processed removing the sequence reads which were of too low quality  and discarding reads containing adaptor sequences or phix control with an in-house filtering protocol.

a paired-end  dna library with a mean insert size of 300 bp was sequenced with average reads of 101 bp on an illumina genome hiseq <dig> . next, a mate-paired  dna library with a mean insert size of 3800 bp was sequenced with average reads of 51 bp on an illumina hiseq <dig> . automatic trimming  and assembly was performed using clc genomics workbench v <dig> . an initial de novo assembly was performed in clc genomics workbench v <dig>  using the quality trimmed and paired reads from the pe and mp reads. all contigs shorter than 200 bp were discarded. remaining n-nucleotides in the scaffolds, introduced during scaffolding, were removed from the final sequence by breaking up the scaffolds back into contigs where they were encountered. the quality of the final draft genome sequence was compared to the initial pe-based de novo assembly through comparative read-mapping in clc genomics workbench v <dig>  using the trimmed read sets. contigs were ordered automatically with mauve  <cit>  and manually with artemis  <cit>  by comparing with cmm ncppb  <dig> 

genome annotation
functional annotation and metabolic reconstruction were performed with  the rapid annotation subsystem technology  server  <cit> , using glimmer  <cit>  for gene calling and allowing frameshift correction, backfilling of gaps and automatic fixing of errors, with  the integrated microbial genomes expert review  annotation pipeline   <cit> . assigned functions were checked with blast  <cit> . alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed with mega  <dig>   <cit> .

comparative genomic analysis
artemis software was used for data management and dnaplotter was used for genome visualization  <cit> . the mauve alignment tool was used for multiple genomes sequence alignment and visualization. islandviewer was used to analyze possible genomic islands  on the draft genome  <cit> . islandviewer integrates two sequence composition gis prediction methods, namely islandpath-dimob  <cit>  and sigi-hmm  <cit>  and one single comparative gi prediction method, namely islandpick  <cit>  for genomic island prediction.

issaga application from isfinder server  <cit>  was used to identify insertion sequences  and transposons in the draft genome of lmg  <dig>  sequences exhibiting homology to is and transposon sequences were verified with the mobilomics software  <cit> . the core genome was estimated using the phylogenetic profiler tool that is part of the img system  at a similarity cutoff of 50%.

the presence of possible virulence-related genes and genes expressed during tomato infection in the draft genome of the non-pathogenic clavibacter was analyzed by comparing it with tomato pathogen cmm ncppb  <dig>  the comparative screening of the gene content was performed in rast, img-er and edgar  <cit> . absence or presence of coding sequences in each genome, as reported by rast, img-er and edgar were independently confirmed by performing protein and nucleotide blast queries in the target genomes. proteins with amino acid sequence similarities higher than 50% and with a coverage higher than 70% were considered homologs. based on the rast, img-er and edgar annotation results, the presence of known and putative virulence factors, pathogenicity related genes and genes uniquely present in the non-pathogenic clavibacter lmg  <dig> were investigated. identification of orthologous groups between four available clavibacter genomes was achieved by orthomcl analyses  <cit> . orthomcl clustering analyses were performed using default parameters with the p-value cut-off = 1 × 10− <dig> 

deposition
the current draft genome sequence was deposited at genbank under accession number azqz <dig> after automatic annotation by the pgaap online annotation pipeline.

RESULTS
general features of non-pathogenic clavibacter lmg 26808
genome assembly using paired-end and mate-paired reads resulted in a  <dig>  mb sequence represented in  <dig> contigs from which the longest covered more than one million bp . the initial pe de novo assembly was used for scaffolding with the mp dataset. in the final consensus sequence each base matched at least phred quality score of  <dig>  lmg  <dig> contains one chromosome and evidence of a presence of a plasmid that showed a high similarity to a klebsiella pneumoniae kp <dig> plasmid poxa- <dig> . the genes of kp <dig> were found on  <dig> contigs in a draft genome of lmg  <dig>  . no sequences of known clavibacter plasmids could be detected. the gc content of the draft genome averages 72%. there are  <dig> trna genes and two complete rrna operons. a total of  <dig> protein-coding genes are predicted in non-pathogenic clavibacter strain , which is similar to the cmm genome ncppb  <dig> that contains  <dig> protein-coding genes. the genome of the non-pathogenic clavibacter strain contains  <dig>  proteins without predicted function being either annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown function.table  <dig>

the number of genes detected in the draft genome of lmg  <dig> was higher than in the other three complete clavibacter genomes . the average nucleotide identity  between the draft genome of the non-pathogenic clavibacter and the three published clavibacter genomes cmm ncppb  <dig> , cms atcc  <dig>  and cmn ncppb  <dig>  was determined using the in silico dna-dna hybridization  method included in the software jspecies  <cit> . the results indicated that lmg  <dig> is genetically most related to cmm ncppb  <dig> , followed by cmn ncppb  <dig>  and cms atcc  <dig> . although based on the ani values the lmg  <dig> genome is the most similar to that of pathogenic cmm ncppb  <dig>  the synteny plots of lmg  <dig> and cmn ncppb  <dig> and the percentage of homologous genes shared by lmg  <dig> and cmn ncppb  <dig> are also considerably high . the genomes of lmg  <dig>  ncppb  <dig> and ncppb  <dig> are collinear with less than  <dig> recombinational breakpoints.table  <dig>

comparison on a genomic scale revealed a high conservation in the gene sequence among genomes of lmg  <dig>  ncppb  <dig> and ncppb  <dig> . there are  <dig> genes  present in the lmg  <dig> draft genome that were not detected in the cmm ncppb  <dig> genome. forty eight of them were detected in cmn and/or cms genomes .  <dig> unique genes of lmg  <dig> were associated with the plasmid and/or low gc regions.  <dig> of the unique genes were found in the core chromosome of lmg  <dig> . almost half of the genes specific for lmg  <dig> belonged to hypothetical or unknown proteins . remaining sequences were coding for additional abc transporters, antibiotic resistance genes, acetyltransferases and several enzymes that in majority could not be assigned to any kegg  pathway . when compared to other clavibacter genomes, lmg  <dig> appeared to not have experienced gene losses and despite it is considered only a draft, the majority of important genes involved in basic metabolism and gene regulation could be detected. comparative analysis  showed that lmg  <dig> lacks sulfate and nitrate reduction pathways suggesting that its capability of survival in soli might be similar to this observed in cmm ncppb  <dig>  the core genome consists of  <dig> homologs found in all four clavibacter genomes. lmg  <dig> contains  <dig> genomic regions exhibiting a lower gc content . several genes coding for proteins within these regions were found to contribute to the fitness of the bacterium ; cl_ <dig> coding for multidrug-efflux transporter). the genome heterogeneity and genetic diversity among clavibacter strains most likely contribute to the differences in the bacterial lifestyle. phage-related recombinases , integrase/resolvase  and other insertion elements  associated with a phage were found in higher numbers in the genome of lmg  <dig> than in the cmm ncppb  <dig> genome . the genome of lmg  <dig> contained sixteen genes coding for transposases and recombinases . this number was much lower in comparison to more than  <dig> genes found in cms   <cit> . detected is belonged to is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> families. transposases were represented by tn <dig> . no pseudogenes among transposases and recombinases were detected suggesting that these elements may encode functional genes. none of the is elements found in lmg  <dig> has homologs in the other clavibacter strains. the most common is element in cms atcc  <dig> is is <dig> <cit> . cmm ncppb  <dig> contains only a few is, which are most probably nonfunctional  <cit> . cmn ncppb  <dig> contained only two types of is, namely ilsre <dig> and isncy .table  <dig> 
mobile genetic elements found in the genome of lmg  <dig> 




the comparison of functional categories as defined by cog  showed noticeable differences in the gene content in categories of ‘carbohydrate transport and metabolism’ and of ‘translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis’. all included clavibacter strains contained a higher percentage of genes in these two categories than a free-living organism escherichia coli  <dig> ed1a or a tomato pathogen as e.g. pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato t <dig> . these observations are supporting the hypothesis that compared clavibacter strains can most probably utilize different sugars as an energy source and that they possess a wide range of transport systems that enable the efficient trafficking of the substrates and products. the presence of a high number of genes involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis implies that these bacteria respond more effectively and rapidly to nutritional resources, which can be an important advantage in a changing environment.

genomic islands
the analysis of the lmg  <dig> genome showed that at least  <dig> regions with lower gc contents distributed among different contigs could be distinguished . parts of genomic islands  <dig> and  <dig> found in lmg  <dig> partly overlap with the chp region of pathogenicity island  described previously in cmm ncppb  <dig> . genomic islands with lower gc% are thought to be integrative elements that exhibit different codon usage relative to the rest of the genome, encode for transposases, integrases and are typically found at trna loci. their acquisition is mostly a result of actions of phages, transposons or horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . some of the genes present in these regions in lmg  <dig> were detected previously in the genome of cmm ncppb  <dig> but the majority represents regions that were not found in clavibacter subspecies. the total size of these regions accounts for 265 kb . the equivalent of pai of cmm ncbi  <dig>  containing two regions chp and toma with important genes responsible for effective plant colonization, was not found in lmg  <dig>  nor in other clavibacter genomes. however, a number of orthologs were found in all three clavibacter genomes . the higher number of orthologs of genes encoded on chp and toma regions  was found in cms atcc  <dig> , followed by lmg  <dig>  and cmn ncppb  <dig> . only six orthologs of pai  found in lmg  <dig> were located on the low gc region  <dig> and  <dig> .

genomic regions with lower gc content can contain diverse genes exhibiting functions in many metabolic processes. the longest region found in lmg  <dig>  included genes coding for antibiotic resistance , transposases  and many hypothetical proteins  some of which showed the highest similarity on the protein level to genes found on klebsiella pneumoniae plasmids. genomic region  <dig> contains some genes that showed similarities to the genes found in pcm <dig> plasmid of cmm ncppb  <dig>  the majority of them are hypothetical proteins and two of them code for acetyltransferases additional file 1: table s <dig>  previous studies indicated that some pathogenic clavibacter strains lacking pcm <dig> and pcm <dig> showed a positive signal in hybridization experiments with specific plasmid regions of cmm ncppb  <dig> implying that some of the genes found originally in cmm plasmids may be actually chromosomally-encoded in other cmm strains  <cit> .

genomic regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with lower gc content contained some genes encoding transposases and recombinases, which might imply their possible exchange/mobilization ability. in region  <dig> one phage-related gene , showing homology to prophage protein gp <dig>  was detected. its presence may represent the remains of prophage genes.

plasmid content
lmg  <dig> did not contain any of two known virulence plasmids found in pathogenic cmm ncppb  <dig>  however, the plasmid extraction demonstrated the presence of one plasmid, which size was slightly smaller than that of plasmid pcm <dig> . initially, we assumed that it might be a pcm <dig> that lost some genes because in the previous study we could not detect the presence of the pat- <dig> gene, which is encoded on the cmm plasmid  <cit> . even though we did not detect the complete pcm <dig>  some of the genes originally encoded on this plasmid were found in lmg  <dig> . except for two genes involved in the putative conjugal transfer , all the remaining genes showed to code for hypothetical or putative secreted proteins. all of them were detected on contig  <dig> but the order in which they were found in lmg  <dig> did not match the order demonstrated in pcm <dig>  moreover, there are more genes present on contig  <dig>  some of which showed to be homologous to proteins from the cmm chromosome . these observations may suggest that some of these plasmid genes were incorporated in the genome of lmg  <dig> 

the observation that some genes from pcm <dig> that were expressed during tomato infection by cmm  <cit>  had orthologs found in lmg  <dig>  might suggest that although their function is unknown, they may be essential for non-pathogenic clavibacter as well as pathogenic cmm strains . further investigation is needed to elucidate the exact functions of these genes. the smaller plasmid pcm <dig> was not detected during the plasmid extraction, nor were its sequences found in the genome sequence of lmg  <dig>  despite that two dna fragments of lmg  <dig> showed to be highly similar to two plasmid-encoded genes, namely pcm1_ <dig> and pcm1_ <dig>  the reciprocal blast search revealed that these sequences from the non-pathogenic clavibacter genome are more similar to the chromosomally encoded cmm_ <dig> and cmm_ <dig>  respectively. interestingly, the latter gene encodes celb, which is a putative secreted cellulase that contains a cellulose-binding domain . chromosomally encoded celb misses one of three protein coding domains present in the cela gene. the missing endoglucanase c-terminal domain is similar to the α-expansin protein family that occurs in plants and is essential for development of wilting and for degradation of crystalline cellulose  <cit> . the lack or disruption of any of these domains of cela inevitably led to the disability to induce disease symptoms in a tomato plant  <cit> .

surprisingly, the genome analysis showed the presence of sequences found in klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid poxa- <dig> . the presence of sequences from a plasmid of gram-negative bacteria in a gram-positive clavibacter strain is rather unusual and has not been reported previously. although the genome sequence of lmg  <dig> is only a draft and therefore incomplete, we could not detect any sequences that could be attributed to a klebsiella pneumoniae kp <dig> chromosome.

the exchange of genetic material between various prokaryotes is well known and has been extensively studied over the last few decades . although it was demonstrated for bacteria that the gene exchange is observed more frequently between closely related genera with a similar gc content and exhibiting high sequence similarities there are examples of recent gene transfers between distantly related bacteria   <cit> .

conjugational transfer is considered the most efficient way of lgt  <cit>  that contribute the most to the spread of antibiotic resistance among different bacteria  <cit> . this type of lgt is widely encountered among various bacterial species and even between bacteria and archaea  <cit>  on the one hand and between bacteria and higher organisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , or plants  <cit>  on the other hand. conjugational plasmid exchange was also observed within the genus clavibacter in which the endophytic cmm <dig> strain  was able to acquire these plasmids from other pathogenic cmm strains and restore pathogenicity  <cit> . furthermore, transformation experiments carried out with clavibacter xyli subsp. cynodontis  demonstrated the possibility to acquire an incp plasmid from enterobacteriaceae by this gram-positive actinobacteria, which provided another evidence of conjugational transfer between diverse taxa  <cit> .

klebsiella pneumoniae strains were found in many important crops such as potato, maize, soybean, cotton and tomato  <cit> . many of these strains carry plasmids that contain antibiotic resistance genes and possess the conjugation transfer systems which enable the gene mobilization and exchange among and outside enterobacteriaceae and other bacterial genera  <cit> . some genes encoded on the klebsiella pneumoniae plasmids exhibit high similarities to regions found previously in escherichia coli and yersinia genomes, implying that there is an active genetic exchange among strains of these genera  <cit> .

although an acquisition by lmg  <dig> of a relatively large plasmid originating most probably from a member of enterobacteriaceae/klebsiella relative by lmg  <dig>  was unexpected and unprecedented, a similar occurrence was previously reported by baltrus and coworkers. they detected a recent acquisition of a megaplasmid by two cucumber isolates of pseudomonas lachrymans <cit> . it was suggested that this acquisition resulted from an important ecological shift across closely related pseudomonas members and that the plasmid-encoded genes may be advantageous for the recipient bacteria.

as klebsiella pneumoniae and clavibacter strains thrive in the same environmental niche  and because of examples of possible genetic material exchange between distantly related bacteria we can hypothesize that the acquisition of plasmid sequences encoding antibiotic resistance genes might provide a competitive advantage for the non-pathogenic clavibacter strain lmg  <dig> 

non-pathogenic lifestyle
non-pathogenic clavibacter strains from tomato seeds tested in the previous study  <cit>  as well as other strains tested by jacques and coworkers  <cit>  did not introduce any disease symptoms when tested on tomato plants. possible explanations for the non-pathogenic nature of these strains are i) the lack of two plasmids present in pathogenic cmm and carrying virulence factors, ii) the absence of the pathogenicity island and iii) a significantly lower number of genes coding for extracellular hydrolytic enzymes including several important serine proteases, glycosyl hydrolases and the plant cell wall-hydrolyzing enzymes.

in pathogenic cmm, main virulence factors cel-a and pat- <dig>  encoded on pcm <dig> and pcm <dig>  respectively, are required to induce disease symptoms  in tomato plants  <cit> . moreover, genes coding for the production of extracellular enzymes, such as endoglucanase, polygalacturonase, xylanase, serine proteases and other secreted proteins have been implicated as possible virulence factors in recent reports  <cit> . the genome of lmg  <dig> did not contain the most prominent virulence factors pat- <dig> and cela. their absence may be directly linked with the absence of the pcm <dig> and pcm <dig> plasmids in the non-pathogenic clavibacter. however, southern hybridization experiments with plasmid fragments containing virulence factors showed that in some plasmid-free pathogenic cmm strains these virulence determinants had homologues on the chromosome  <cit> .

a proteomic study of tomato-cmm interaction identified several bacterial proteins with a putative role in signal perception, transduction and response to impulses. they belong to two-component system proteins, transcriptional regulators and other dna binding proteins. they are believed to play a role in sensing the tomato plant environment and initiating pathways, possibly leading to disease development  <cit> . all putative genes encoding proteins that are probably involved in signal exchange between tomato and bacterium could be identified in the genome sequence of lmg  <dig> .

as a non-pathogenic bacterium, lmg  <dig> was hypothesized to contain less genomic information for hydrolytic enzymes that are known to be expressed during tomato infection with cmm  <cit> . as expected, the most important group containing genes coding for secreted proteases from pat- <dig> family was largely absent in lmg  <dig> . additional pat- <dig> homologues encoded on the pcm <dig> plasmid  were also absent. from seven genes encoding putative serine proteases chpa-chpg   <cit>  only sequences similar to chpf and chpg were detected . both these sequences, however, matched to the same region and a reciprocal best blast hit confirmed the presence of only chpf. interestingly, the lack of chpg may be a possible explanation for the disability of lmg  <dig> to produce a hr in nonhost plants since the chpg mutant in cmm was unable to cause an hr in mirabilis jalapa <cit> . moreover, the low colonization efficiency of lmg  <dig> could be attributed to the lack of the chpc gene. a chpc mutation in the pathogenic cmm ncppb  <dig> resulted in a drastic reduction in colonization abilities in tomato plants  <cit> . pseudogenes chpa, chpb and chpd were not found in lmg  <dig>  the family of chp genes is important for plant-pathogen interaction in cmm, but probably also in cms where four orthologs were found. cmn genome had no orthologs of these genes.

the majority of members of secreted serine proteases of the ppa family  that are encoded in several different loci on the chromosome and on pcm <dig> could not be found in lmg  <dig>  orthologs of ppai and ppaf were found in lmg  <dig>  cms atcc  <dig> contained orthologs of ppab <dig>  ppab <dig>  ppaf, ppai, ppaa in the chromosome and ppac on pcs <dig> plasmid. on the contrary cmn ncppb  <dig> had only one ortholog of ppaf. since ppaa and ppac genes are important for plant colonization  <cit>  and they were absent in lmg  <dig>  it can be another evidence why non-pathogenic clavibacter strains are poorly colonizing tomato plants. indeed, secreted serine proteases studied in pathogenic cmm are thought to presumably facilitate the interaction between cmm and its host plant and are believed to play a function in pathogenicity by a possible utilization of plant proteins  <cit> . their lack might imply that interaction between lmg  <dig> and tomato is actually very limited. toma gene of cmm ncppb  <dig> , encoding endo- <dig> - beta galactosidase involved in detoxification of the alfa-tomatine, had orthologs in three other clavibacter genomes. however, the similarity based on the amino acid sequence was rather low / identity : 47/ <dig> in cms, 47/ <dig> in cmn and 47/ <dig> in lmg 26808).

genes coding for subtilases sbta, sbtb and sbtc are known to be secreted during the plant infection  <cit> . orthologs of these three subtilases genes were found in all four clavibacter genomes. sbt proteins of cmm are highly similar to different tomato subtilases, some of which have been associated with wound formation and pathogen responses  <cit>  and may play a role in the disease development. because they are present in the non-pathogenic clavibacter strain their function probably cannot be solely associated with the disease development. cellulases and pectinases are the most important enzymes degrading plant cell walls. in many bacteria genes encoding these enzymes were found to be virulence determinants  <cit> . in the genome of lmg  <dig> genes for pectate lyases, pela <dig> and pela <dig> and cellulase cela were not found. however, another cellulase celb, the polygalacturonase pgaa , xysa  and an arylesterase   <cit>  were present in lmg  <dig> . these findings support the thesis that the non-pathogenic clavibacter strain is probably less efficient in digesting pectins and cellulose into simpler by-products than the pathogenic cmm that is equipped with many various plant cell degrading enzymes.

enzymes from a large group of glycosyl hydrolases  which hydrolyze the glycosidic bond between two carbohydrates or between a carbohydrate and a noncarbohydrate molecule  <cit>  were also expressed during plant infection of cmm. therefore, many of them are assumed to be potential virulence factors that can hydrolyze substrates of plant origin  <cit> . our results demonstrated that genes for the majority of these enzymes are present in lmg  <dig> suggesting that their function might not be restricted to disease development alone. the glycosyl hydrolases are not considered as bona fide virulence factors, but as reflecting the adaptation to the differing composition of nutrients in planta allowing the survival inside of the plant.

very important functions involved in transport and metabolism are linked to the presence of abc and other transporters that ensure the uptake of amino acids, metals, sugars, oligopeptides, etc. some of these transporters that were expressed during tomato infection by cmm may utilize plant molecules to support its metabolism. the genes found in the genome of lmg  <dig> that code for transporters that are known to be expressed during plant infection by cmm are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  interestingly, only five orthologs of fifty seven transporters could not be found in lmg  <dig>  furthermore, the genome of non-pathogenic clavibacter contained additional transporters that were not present in the pathogenic cmm genome . some of them are supposed to play a role in the active drug transport and cell protection from toxic metabolites . another very important example of additional abc transporters in the genome of lmg  <dig>  are transporters involved in iron complex transport  . an alternative iron uptake system found in lmg  <dig> might be advantageous in an iron deficient environment. this data suggests that lmg  <dig> is probably able to utilize a broad variety of compounds to maximize its survival changes. many environmental bacteria were shown to contain a high number of transporter genes in support of an environmental lifestyle  <cit> .

observations described above correlate well with the initial assumptions that suggested that non-pathogenic clavibacter strains must have lost or never contained prominent virulence determinants responsible for disease induction in tomato plants. these hypotheses were partially underpinned by similar findings in another draft genome of non-pathogenic clavibacter lmg  <dig>  which lacks the majority of virulence factors including two main determinants. it also contained less plant cell degrading enzymes than pathogenic cmm ncppb  <dig> . furthermore, the comparative genome analysis of lmg  <dig> and cmm ncppb  <dig> revealed that some putative virulence factors, determined based on expression levels obtained from the proteomic study of tomato-cmm interaction  <cit> , were also present in lmg  <dig>  which may indicate their redundant functions and suggest that they are not critical for cmm virulence.

survival in the environmental niche
non-pathogenic clavibacter strain lmg  <dig> was isolated from tomato seeds yet knowledge on its environmental niche is largely lacking. ecological niche and transmission routes have not yet been found. preliminary results with colonization experiments showed poor colonization of vascular tissues of tomato and seemingly lower survival potential of lmg  <dig> in comparison to cmm  <cit> . the hr was not induced in mirabilis jalapa , indicating that non-pathogenic clavibacter strains do not contain genes that would be recognized by the plant to trigger the active plant defense response.

antibiotic resistance. in the genome of lmg  <dig> several additional genes responsible for antibiotic resistance were detected . they coded for beta-lactamases , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  and tetracycline efflux protein teta . they showed the highest similarity to genes found in klebsiella pneumonia, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica suggesting that they could originate from these bacteria. in addition to the above genes, the genome of lmg  <dig> contains two drug efflux transporters  not found in pathogenic cmm ncppb  <dig>  interestingly, lmg  <dig> contained glyoxalase/bleomycin resistance protein , which probably constitutes the resistance to bleomycin-antibiotic produced by some streptomyces strains  <cit> .

the presence of additional acetyltransferases might suggest that lmg  <dig> exhibits broad resistance to certain antibiotics as some of the acetyltransferases  catalyze the selective acetylation of one of the four amino groups found on a diverse set of aminoglycosides with antibiotic properties  <cit> . acetylation reduces the affinity of these compounds for the acceptor trna site on the 30s ribosome. as a consequence, bacteria expressing these genes are resistant to some aminoglycosides with antibiotic properties. the ability to cope with antibiotics produced by organisms with which non-pathogenic clavibacter strains share the environmental niche is a significant adaptive advantage. the growth of clavibacter strains in culture is often inhibited by other faster growing organisms. therefore, the presence of genes coding for antibiotic resistance might be the reason why non-pathogenic clavibacter strains are more frequently encountered and isolated from the semi-specific medium during the tomato seed certification.

toxin-antitoxin system. the presence of the toxin-antitoxin  genes  in the genome of non-pathogenic clavibacter is intriguing and raises questions concerning their origin and potential functions in relation to the physiology of the bacterium . the yefm and yoeb t-a genes were found in many bacterial genomes and sometimes more than one copy per genome  <cit> . it was demonstrated that t-a systems are present only in environmental and free-living organisms and were not detected in intracellular bacteria  <cit> . the blastp analysis of yefm and yoeb genes from lmg  <dig> revealed high similarities to proteins from rhodococcus pyridinivorans ak <dig> and microbacterium testaceum stlb <dig>  respectively. the t-a system found in lmg  <dig> was not present in the pathogenic cmm, but yefm  was present in another non-pathogenic clavibacter strain lmg  <dig> . interestingly, cmn contained another putative toxin-antitoxin system. t-a systems are not essential for normal cell growth, nevertheless they are present in many bacteria and archaea  <cit> . based on the frequency of t-a systems, it was suggested that they play subtle roles that are advantageous for cell survival in their natural habitats. toxins may facilitate cellular adaptation of an organism to changing environments by slowing down its cell growth, inhibiting its cell growth, or causing some of its cells to die  <cit> . it is possible that the presence of a t-a system in the lmg  <dig> genome increases the fitness of this bacterium in the occupied environmental niche. differences in the detected toxin-antitoxin systems in particular clavibacter subspecies might be attributed to different ecological niches and inhabited hosts.

error prone umudc operon. sos mutagenesis response in bacteria includes error-prone and error-free dna damage repair responses that are activated after exposure to different antibiotics, chemical compounds or radiation  <cit> . in escherichia coli umudc proteins are involved in error-prone bypass of uv lesions and umuc proteins possess dna polymerase activity. in the sos process many genes get induced and their products are involved in dna repair, replication and cell cycle control in order to repair the dna damage  <cit> . the genes coding for this operon were found in lmg  <dig> and also in another non-pathogenic clavibacter, lmg  <dig> , implying that their cells might have higher abilities to recover after exposures to uv and/or other types of chemicals retrieved during the seed certification procedures. some of the sequences coding for genes of umuc operon  and antibiotic resistance genes  described above are associated with the plasmid and/or low gc regions .

the extracellular polysaccharide . the genomes of all four analyzed clavibacter strains contained four gene clusters involved in exopolysaccharides production . the eps production in lmg  <dig> is expected to effectively occur since all genes involved in that process are functional . lmg  <dig> contains almost a complete set of genes involved in the eps production described in cmm ncppb  <dig>  there is, however, one notable difference between pathogenic cmm ncppb  <dig> and lmg  <dig>  in the eps <dig> of lmg  <dig> the order of the genes is disrupted because they are located at different contigs. the functionality of this gene cluster is therefore unknown. even if functional, it will probably be dependent on different regulation factors which may eventually influence the eps production. eps gene clusters in the pathogenic cms underwent quite some drastic changes with disruptions by insertion elements and most likely the eps production in cms atcc  <dig> is limited. eps clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are also complete in cmn ncppb  <dig>  in case of the eps cluster  <dig> in cmn ncppb  <dig> there are three additional genes  located in between other genes . the main eps composition of cmm and cms strains was determined experimentally and it showed some differences even though the general structure of a repeating unit of four sugars seems to be the same  <cit> . the number of hydrolases in cms atcc  <dig> and cmm ncppb  <dig> is the same but some of them show lower similarities indicating differing substrate specificity/a different sugar incorporated. the composition of eps in lmg  <dig> was not yet experimentally determined. even though this non-pathogenic strain showed a very similar genetic structure of eps clusters to those of cmm ncppb  <dig> some genes have lower similarities ; glucosyl transferases ). these findings indicate that the composition of eps might be different between cmm and non-pathogenic strains. in many bacteria the ability to produce eps and their presence in the cell wall surface has been shown to participate in the interaction between bacteria and the environment. eps is believed to prevent bacterial attachment to host cells which in consequence prevents the recognition of the bacteria by the host and the induction of an hr reaction  <cit> . in many plant pathogens eps production prevents bacterial immobilization by host lectins and in that way allows bacteria to spread in the xylem vessels  <cit> . the presence of at least three functional eps gene clusters in lmg  <dig> might facilitate the eps production in different environmental conditions and can be an advantage for non-pathogenic clavibacter, which probably inhabits not only tomato seeds but also other environmental niches.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the genome sequence of the non-pathogenic clavibacter lmg  <dig> revealed that this strain is adapted to a non-pathogenic lifestyle. this is reflected by the lack of prominent virulence factors present in pathogenic cmm and by the presence of a significantly lower number of genes encoding enzymes involved in digesting plant material and extracellular proteins that are potential virulence determinants. also, lmg  <dig> contained many transport proteins and transcriptional regulators implying its capacity to utilize various compounds and to respond rapidly to a changing environment. the genome of lmg  <dig> contained also a high number of abc transporters and genes involved in the cell signalling .

the draft genome of the non-pathogenic clavibacter strain and the comparative analysis with other whole clavibacter genomes provided valuable insights into the genetic bases of pathogenicity and mechanisms involved in the adaptation to host plants and to environmental niches. our results demonstrated that some of the putative virulence factors were also present in lmg  <dig>  which suggests that these genes rather contribute to the general fitness  of the bacterium by increasing competitiveness and adaptive abilities in the same environment than playing a role in virulence. whether the non-pathogenic clavibacter strain can turn into a pathogen will depend not only on the presence of additional fitness genes that allow for efficient host colonization and adaptation, but mainly on the presence of functional virulence genes. lmg  <dig> does not contain cela and pat- <dig>  the two most important virulence factors and lacks some other important determinants contributing to the effective plant colonization and involved in cell maceration and degradation. this specific combination of features likely represents the basis of its nature as a free-living bacterium and might exhibit the possible evolutionary process that involves horizontal gene transfer and gene loss, which shaped this bacterium into a non-pathogen. because the diversity of non-pathogenic clavibacter strains investigated so far is much higher than observed for cmm it will be very interesting to investigate more of these strains in order to reveal the common genetic features and to determine factors responsible for their non-pathogenic nature. so far, some of the genomic adaptations, such as the presence of additional antibiotic resistance genes and a toxin-antitoxin system could be confirmed in a draft genome sequence of another non-pathogenic clavibacter strain . a more in-depth comparative analysis with newly sequenced clavibacter genomes will allow generating more knowledge about underlying biology of these bacteria and enabling the selection of group-specific regions that will serve as targets for development of reliable identification primers for novel control strategies.

the availability of genome sequences of clavibacter strains is a critical to understanding of the processes involved in the evolution of these subspecies and in gaining more insight into the genetic basis of their pathogenic and non-pathogenic nature. our findings confirmed the thesis that the non-pathogenic clavibacter strain contains specific fitness factors but lacks crucial virulence determinants, which likely contribute to its poor colonization abilities and survival in the tomato plant. the comparison of cmm and a non-pathogenic clavibacter strains demonstrated that it is difficult to define real virulence factors since some of the genes previously assigned as putative virulence factors for cmm are also present in the non-pathogenic strain. the role of many putative virulence factors is not clear, which partially can be attributed to the functional redundancy of these genes and to the complex and not well understood processes of their regulation. in consequence, it is dependent on the environmental niche and growth conditions  whether the presence of additional factors increasing the general strain fitness will contribute to virulence.
