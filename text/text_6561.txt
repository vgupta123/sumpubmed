BACKGROUND
genetic variation exists between individuals  of all organisms and it makes up the genetic basis for phenotypic differences between individuals. in addition, genetic variation functions as a valuable resource for mapping phenotypic traits in model organisms. single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant form of genetic variation and therefore dominate high-resolution genetic mapping strategies. moreover, numerous well-performing high-throughout snp detection technologies have been developed, like oligonucleotide array-based technology, mass-spectrometry-based technology , and sequence-based technology   <cit> , which makes automated snp detection favored above the more labor-intensive detection of microsatellite markers  <cit> .

since the availability of its genome, the laboratory rat is gaining influence as a genetic model organism  <cit> . in addition, over  <dig> well-characterized inbred strains that are models for a wide variety of human diseases are available  <cit> . however, the availability of genetic tools, like a dense genome-wide snp marker set, is still subordinate compared to other commonly used model organisms. this is illustrated by the number of entries in dbsnp, the central snp repository of ncbi  <cit> : the amount of human , chicken , and mouse  entries surpass the amount of rat entries  spectacularly. in search for rat snps, experimental  <cit>  and computational  <cit>  approaches have been employed, but these efforts primarily resulted in snps associated with coding regions. for genetic mapping purposes, a much denser marker set, preferentially equally distributed over the genome, is required.

laboratory rat strains are thought to be established from a limited number of founder animals originating from a domesticated wild population  <cit> . the value of inbred strains emanates from the close genetic uniformity that facilitates phenotyping and genotyping. in principle, inbred strains are selectively bred for certain traits from a genetically diverse pool, comprising diverse genetic information about the trait. however, since many of the current rat strains were derived from common ancestral stocks and simply inbred to increase genetic uniformity, inbred strains clearly share alleles  <cit> . although such simplified models are essential for biomedical research, modulating effects on the clinical manifestation of a trait resulting from genetic heterogeneity in a population can only be studied to a limited extent in f <dig> hybrids. the use of a carefully chosen selection of inbred strains may address this issue, but the choice depends on knowledge on the relationship between the strains and hence the degree of genetic variation. alternatively, wild-derived strains may be good alternatives to introduce sufficient genetic variation in laboratory experiments  <cit> .

based on a preliminary observation that alleles from laboratory rat strains are frequently detected in wild-derived samples, we developed a wild rat-based snp discovery approach. the method consists of shotgun sequencing of a wild rat-derived genomic library followed by comparison with the published rat genome . genotyping commonly used rat strains for newly identified snps revealed that 84% of snp-alleles  occurring between bn and a single wild individual is also represented in one or more laboratory strains. a user-friendly webtool allows exploration of the genetic variation between any arbitrary combinations of two strains that were used in this study, making all information directly available for experimental use.

RESULTS
wild rat-based snp discovery
it is generally believed that commonly used rat strains originate from a wild-derived founder population of limited size  <cit> . to examine whether polymorphisms found in laboratory strains are still represented in individuals of the wild population, we typed two wild-derived samples for confirmed snps of the cascad database  <cit> . interestingly, about 53% of alleles , which were confirmed to exist in laboratory strains, were also represented in wild  <dig>  wild  <dig> or both . hence, a preselection of highly likely candidate snps could potentially be made by genotyping wild individuals and comparing the sequences to the rat genome sequence .

accordingly, we performed random shotgun sequencing on a genomic library of a wild rat . we generated shotgun traces  by bidirectional sequencing of about  <dig>  colonies .  <dig> % of the reads  could be mapped to a unique location in the brown norway rat genome using blat  <cit> , resulting in the automated identification of nearly  <dig>  ambiguous nucleotide positions . manual inspection of the sequencing reads reduced this set of potential polymorphisms to a set of  <dig> real snps and  <dig> indels. the average snp rate between bn  and this single wild rat is estimated to be about  <dig> per  <dig> bp and, hence, discovery of a novel snp can be expected every second shotgun read. a subset of the discovered snps was verified and genotyped in  <dig> commonly used strains . to this end, we designed primers for  <dig> snp-containing amplicons  of which  <dig>  were successfully read by unidirectional sequencing of the pcr products, resulting in roughly  <dig> kbp high quality sequence per strain or individual .

* amplicons are designed for the  <dig> snp candidates.

wild rat-derived snp characteristics
the verification of  <dig> candidate snps by amplicon-based resequencing in  <dig> inbred rat strains and three wild-derived samples  revealed  <dig> polymorphisms, consisting of  <dig> indels, seven 2-bp substitutions, one 3-bp substitution, one 5-bp substitution, and  <dig> snps, of which only one was tri-allelic. the amplicons are randomly distributed over the genome . we observed heterozygous positions in the outbred strains, but unexpectedly some were also found in the inbred strains . for our analysis, we considered these loci to be polymorphic as compared to the bn genome sequence.

from the  <dig> shotgun-based candidate snps,  <dig> were located in the  <dig> pcr amplicons that worked, and  <dig>  were reconfirmed by resequencing . strikingly, for  <dig>  of the confirmed snps, the wild rat allele is also present in one or more commonly used strains, with only  <dig>  being specific to bn . of the remaining  <dig>  snps, wild rat alleles are not present in any of the  <dig> selected strains and could be considered wild rat-specific. these results illustrate that shotgun sequencing one wild individual efficiently identifies shared polymorphisms among commonly used rat strains.

* by genotyping two other wild individuals , additional polymorphisms were identified, which could not have been found by shotgun sequencing only wild  <dig> 

while genotyping by resequencing,  <dig> novel snps were discovered that were not identified in the shotgun sequencing experiment . about 39%  of this set can be accounted for by differences in the sequence coverage between the shotgun reads and the resequencing genotyping reads , whereas the remaining part of this set is strongly biased towards snps that are not polymorphic between bn and wild rat  <dig> and thus could not have been discovered in the shotgun experiment. interestingly, about 37% of the newly discovered snps are polymorphic between the shotgun sequenced wild rat and any of the inbred strains . when considering all snps that are polymorphic in the set of  <dig> commonly used laboratory strains, of the majority  the wild rat allele is found back in one of the strains  and this percentage increases only slightly  when two other wild individuals  are included in the analysis. this indicates that wild rat-based snp discovery is already highly efficient using a single wild sample.

based on the genotyping results, the snp rate between bn and the shotgun sequenced wild rat  is  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp . the snp rate within the  <dig> rat strains, including bn, is  <dig> in  <dig>  and the snp rate in the entire experiment, including the wild rat , bn, and the other strains is  <dig> in  <dig> bp . to compare wild rat inter-individual variation with the inter-strain variation for commonly used inbred strains, we calculated the number of snps that are polymorphic when comparing arbitrary combinations of  <dig> strains. genotyping of  <dig> snp positions in the three wild rats resulted in  <dig> polymorphic positions, whereas the most polymorphic combination of inbred strains in this experiment  yielded  <dig> snps. this indicates that three random, but potentially related, dutch wild rats are about equally polymorphic as three carefully selected inbred strains. inclusion of wild isolates from other locations worldwide may increase the efficiency of the snp discovery approach.

intraspecific phylogenetic network
relationships among different rat strains have been determined previously by phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on microsatellite markers  <cit> . however, intraspecific relationships for laboratory strains are often very challenging to determine, due to small genetic distances and complex gene flow. the resulting multitude of plausible trees is best expressed by a network, which displays alternative potential evolutionary paths in the form of cycles  <cit> . we used network software  to construct a spatial network, based on  <dig> snp markers in  <dig> rat strains and three wild rat individuals . the three wild individuals are grouped together, possibly due to the geographic and possibly genetic relation between the samples, but in accordance with the last paragraph of the previous section, they appear relatively unrelated as compared to the set of inbred strains.

the majority of the snps  was selected for being polymorphic between wild  <dig> and bn. as a result, different bn substrains , depicted as a double-sized end node because of high similarity, and different wild rat individuals  are grouped together as the outliers. several strains that are known to be closely related  are also grouped together, like da and cop or ss and sr. interestingly, wky is also an outlier, indicating that besides bn, this strain can be utilized as an alternative mapping strain. wky is already commonly used as a normotensive control strain in genetic mapping of blood pressure quantitative trait loci  <cit> . wky is known to be closely related to shr and these strains are indeed grouped together . additionally, bdii and bdix are related and bde is an ri strain from e <dig>  these strain combinations are also grouped together. wistar is contributing to a large subset of these strains, like wky, wc, bdii, mwf, lew, and wf, which contributes to the complexity of the network structure.

data availability
the use of genetic markers for mapping traits in rat strains has been exploited for long time already. current marker sets in rats are mostly limited to microsatellites  <cit> , which are not abundantly available and are commonly detected in a more laborious way than snps. in this study, we have determined a total of about  <dig>  genotypes , out of which the vast majority are snps. this data is accessible via a versatile webtool  <cit> . pairs of strains of interest can be selected and explored on presence of verified genetic variation. besides a graphical representation of the location of the snps on a genome map, primer sequences that were successfully used in our experiments are also provided. in a pairwise comparison matrix , we plotted the absolute number of polymorphic positions for each of the strains or individuals used. interestingly, for some strains different alleles are observed in substrains , in line with previous observations  <cit> .

the matrix is built from genotyping data of  <dig> polymorphisms in  <dig> strains and three wild individuals. two inbred strains are represented by two substrains  and outbred sd is represented by two individuals from different stocks. sets of polymorphisms, including a graphical representation, can be retrieved from  <cit> .

simulation experiment wild rat-based snp discovery
to get insight in the benefits of using wild rats in snp discovery studies, we simulated larger scale experiments based on the results obtained in the experiments described above. shotgun sequencing of  <dig> kbp resulted in the identification of  <dig> snps. for  <dig> of those, the wild rat allele was also represented in laboratory rat strains and hence of interest for research purposes. the maximum amount of snps that can be discovered by fully sequencing this single rat is calculated by multiplying the snp frequency  with the rat genome size , which is  <dig> , <dig> snps. since none of our shotgun reads were overlapping, we can calculate the relation between shotgun sequencing reads of the wild rat and the amount of snps that will be found by scaling up this methodology, assuming random distribution of  <dig> bp shotgun reads over the genome . one million shotgun reads of a single wild rat would already result in the discovery of  <dig>  novel snps that are polymorphic in commonly used rat strains. this simulation indicates that a relatively small sequencing effort could potentially result in a vast expansion of the amount of genetic variation for the rat.

because shotgun sequencing was only done in the wild rat  <dig>  we cannot make a direct comparison between wild rat-based snp discovery and snp discovery based on rat strains separately. however, a similar simulation experiment can be performed by treating the genotyping resequencing as shotgun reads. for wild  <dig>  this would result in the identification of  <dig> snps as compared to the bn genome sequence. for  <dig> of those, the wild rat allele is found back in one of the inbred strains. for the combination of three strains most polymorphic as compared to bn in this experiment, the latter number would be  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for aug, shr, and wf, respectively. simulations based on these numbers show that it requires nearly two times as much shotgun sequencing in different inbred strains separately to discover the same amount of snps that can be found using the wild rat shotgun sequencing approach. it should be mentioned that parallel shotgun sequencing of all  <dig> inbred strains until saturation has the potential to yield  <dig>  times as many snps as compared to the wild-derived approach . an advantage of using inbred strains for snp discovery is that the genotype of the strain is immediately known. nevertheless, reconfirmation of the snp or genotyping of other strains of interest may be necessary anyway, minimizing the relevance of this advantage.

discussion
an increase in the amount of documented genetic variation for the rat will be essential to allow for high-resolution genetic mapping of the many inherited traits that have now been described for a wide variety of rat inbred strains. in addition, insight into genetic variation between rat strains provides valuable information on genetic relationships between strains, which can be instrumental to dissect the genetic basis of phenotypic differences. the wild rat-based shotgun sequencing method described here provides an efficient approach to generate such a dense map of genetic variation. to be able to benefit from haplotype-based mapping approaches  <cit>  a high marker density is needed to first reliably define haplotype blocks in strains of interest  <cit> . for the mouse, it has recently been announced that  <dig> inbred strains will be fully resequenced to achieve this goal  <cit> . with extreme dense genotype maps, it may even become possible to clone traits by haplotype-based in silico mapping  <cit> , but to achieve this, it is estimated that complete sequences of over  <dig> strains are needed  <cit> . although densities needed for these approaches are not reached, we do show here that wild rat-based snp discovery is potentially much more effective than shotgun sequencing different inbred strains. we propose that the most effective snp discovery strategy for the rat would be one based on shotgun sequencing of a single wild-derived sample and subsequent low-cost high-throughput genotyping of the resulting candidates in the laboratory strains of interest. many other model organisms are currently undergoing full coverage sequencing and snp discovery in these organisms will become increasingly important, especially for those organisms that are selectively bred for specific traits, such as cow and pig. pilot experiments using for example wild-derived swine samples could be performed to test whether it is eligible to efficiently transfer the wild isolate-based snp discovery strategy to other organisms.

our results do provide insight in the genetic descent of the laboratory rat. it is generally accepted that current rat strains underwent two major genetic bottlenecks. first, they originate from a small founder population of domesticated wild rats and second, they were selectively inbred to obtain homogeneity  <cit> . the three dutch wild rats used in this study are potentially relatively closely related as compared to wild rats from different parts of the world, but the genetic variation between them is mostly larger than or sporadically equal to any combination of three inbred strains, indeed suggesting the existence a common genetic bottleneck for laboratory strains. in addition, the laboratory rat does not show an extensive polymorphism rate in the mhc  as compared to other species  <cit> , like human, cattle etc. cramer et al. has analyzed the mhc of wild rats and compared the data with those from inbred strains  <cit> . in line with our observation, there were not many new haplotypes.

we observed that wild rat genetic variation is to a large extent represented in the inbred strains, which is in sharp contrast to genetic variation in wild-derived mouse strains that is mostly unique  <cit> . contrary to classical mouse inbred strains, where multiple subspecies contribute to the genetic make-up  <cit>  and recent mouse strains, derived from different mus species  <cit> , laboratory rat strains are most likely descending from a single rat species, rattus norvegicus  <cit> .

an independent study using  <dig> microsatellites in german and japanese wild-derived samples showed that the genetic profiles were quite divergent, partially owing to different geographic locations  <cit> . our study involved only dutch wild rats, suggesting that the inclusion of wild rats from different parts of the world could result in even more efficient snp discovery, although it also remains to be demonstrated what proportion of the additional discovered alleles is present in the inbred strains and if a geographic bias for this exists.

when multiple snps are present per locus/amplicon, independent haplotypes can be discerned. the genetic variation identified here is mostly organized in a limited amount of haplotypes per locus . theoretically, an amplicon containing two or three snps can be represented by four and eight haplotypes, respectively, but in our dataset the vast majority of amplicons harboring multiple snps is represented by only two or three haplotypes . again, these observations suggest the existence of a common and small founding population with very limited haplotype diversity and/or a very narrow genetic bottleneck before inbred strain selection. the observed small genetic basis in a wide selection of laboratory rat strains does not mimic genetic variation in the human population and as a result, studies and pharmacological tests in rat models neglect potential modulatory effects caused by genetic variation. although the use of f <dig> crosses and mosaic populations  <cit>  could address this issue, our data suggests that wild-derived rats may be very useful to this end, since a large amount of all genetic variation present in a large selection of inbred strains, is already represented in a limited number of individuals. therefore, it would be very interesting to investigate genetic variation in recently domesticated inbred  <cit>  and outbred rats such as wild-type groningen rats   <cit> . alternatively, careful selection of inbred strains based on genotyping data and subsequent random breeding may also expose the wild side of laboratory rats.

*) total number of amplicons that contains at least two snps. amplicons containing no snps or only indels were excluded from this analysis. amplicons containing  <dig> snp are also excluded, since two-state snps always give rise to two haplotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe a snp discovery platform for the rat that is based on two steps. first, candidate snps are discovered by shotgun sequencing a wild rat, followed by genotyping laboratory strains of interest. we show that 84% of alleles in wild rats as compared to the sequenced brown norway rat genome are also represented in a set of  <dig> laboratory strains. hence, the approach described here would be an efficient strategy for the discovery of novel informative snps in the laboratory rat. inclusion of other wild samples, preferably from different locations in the world could result in an even more effective snp discovery platform, as the three wild rats in our study, caught in relative close vicinity to each other, were already more polymorphic than the most polymorphic combination of carefully selected inbred strains. based on the more than  <dig>  genotyping datapoints obtained in this study, we postulate two things. first, laboratory rats originate from a single rat species, and inbred stains are relatively closely related with a limited number of haplotypes, reflecting known genetic bottlenecks in strain establishment. second, wild rats have the potential to represent the degrees of genetic variation as present in the human population much more efficiently than a random selection of inbred strains. this makes them or wild-derived strains potentially well-suited for studying modulatory effects of genetic background variation on specific phenotypes, such as behavior or responses to drug treatment.
