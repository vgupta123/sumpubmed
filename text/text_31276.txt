BACKGROUND
the tropical rain forest  biome covers just ~7% of land but harbors over half of the planet's terrestrial biodiversity. the trf of africa represents the second largest extent of this biome after the amazon basin, and contains high levels of species diversity and especially endemicity  <cit> . two main african rain forest blocks exist. the most widespread one corresponds to the guineo-congolian floristic region  <cit> , which extends almost continuously  from west africa into the congo basin and east of the democratic republic of congo and uganda. the east african rain forests are concentrated on a smaller and patchier surface extending from kenya to southern mozambique along the coast and the eastern arcs  <cit> . this latter block contains one of the highest concentrations of endemic species on earth  <cit> .

understanding the evolutionary processes responsible for high species richness of trf has been a major focus of evolutionary biology  <cit> , although most studies have focused on the amazon and australian rain forests. two main hypotheses have been advanced to explain speciation processes that have led to high levels of biodiversity in african trf  <cit> : 1) geographic isolation between populations restricted to rain forest patches resulting in allopatric speciation ; 2) divergent selection related to ecological gradients where genetic and/or geographic isolation is minor  <cit> . ecology is central to the processes of divergence and speciation  <cit>  but in the two speciation models above  ecology plays contrasting roles  <cit> . in the former, it would be expected that the variables that make up a niche have low rates of change over a phylogeny . this pattern would be predicted when taxa that are restricted to rain forest patches have been tracking the geographical distribution of this biome, being unable to adapt to changing conditions. in contrast, in the case of divergent selection, ecological divergence and adaptation to new niches would be a fundamental prerequisite  <cit> , and the variables comprising species' niches would be expected to deviate less from a random distribution over a phylogeny than in the case of geographic isolation. for example, adaptation to more arid environments since the miocene has been suggested to be a driver of diversification in some african plant genera  <cit> . thus, a possible first step in unraveling trf diversification in africa is to understand the role of ecology in explaining present day diversity.

new developments in ecological niche modeling  or species distribution modeling have provided important advances in the understanding of species distribution  <cit> , as well as in the study of ecological speciation . these methods combine data about the known distribution of a species with climatic and other relevant variables to identify those environmental conditions that are suitable for that species and predict its potential distribution. such methods allow for a precise quantification of ecological parameters specific to each species, which in turn enables the use of statistical tests to answer questions about niche differentiation or similarity  <cit> .

here, we used an integrative approach including a dated molecular phylogeny  <cit>  and enm to investigate the evolutionary ecology of two african trf genera isolona and monodora . both genera contain small to large trees largely distributed across the african rain forests from west/central africa to east africa. a recent monograph of both genera provides information about species delimitation as well as their distribution  <cit> . isolona contains  <dig> species,  <dig> of them endemic to madagascar, while monodora contains  <dig> species and is absent from madagascar  <cit> . a large number of species grow in lowland rain forests, but a few occur in montane areas , as well as in less humid regions growing in thicket or woodland such as in malawi and northern south africa. both genera have been recovered as sister with maximum support nested within a large clade of african genera  <cit> . moreover, the presence of phylogenetic signal of certain climatic variables identified within monodora has been previously suggested but not explicitly tested  <cit> . finally, hutchinson underlined  <cit>  that the ecological niche of species is multi dimensional. for this study we shall use climatic data for africa as this is available for all species used in this study, in contrast to other ecological data for which we have very spars records . moreover, bioclimatic models appear suitable to generate predictions of species ecological requirements at the macro-scale studied here   <cit> .

the goal of this study was to understand the role of ecology in the speciation and distribution of both genera. we identified sister species and tested for niche similarity and for phylogenetic signal of different climatic variables within the clade. specifically we addressed the following questions: do sister species have similar ecological niches? can we detect a phylogenetic signal of environmental variables?

RESULTS
phylogeny
using the molecular phylogenies published by  <cit>  we identified a total of  <dig> species pairs  generally based on strong support values. no comparisons were undertaken within the monophyletic malagasy clade because the focus of this study was directed towards mainland africa. in the cases where support values were low comparisons were undertaken on species that were grouped together in the different prior phylogenetic analyses . morphology and palynology provide little information on species relationships when compared to molecular phylogenies, especially in monodora  <cit> . monodora crispata and m. tenuifolia were considered as sister albeit with low support because these two species were also recovered as sister  in other analyses . in one case, relationships between three species  were unresolved and thus comparisons were undertaken between all possible pairs . within isolona, four species of mainland africa were not sampled and their exact placement remains unknown. even though strong support for some sister species relationships are lacking, the phylogeny of couvreur et al.  <cit>  provides the best hypothesis of species relationship to date.

mean divergence ages  for all sister species ranged from on average  <dig>  to  <dig> million years ago . in some cases, estimation of the 95% highest posterior density confidence intervals was not possible given the low node support. finally, most sister species pairs occurred in allopatry or had little geographic range overlap . calculations indicated that species pairs varied from no overlap  to  <dig> % overlap .

bioclim variables
for most sampled species there were more than ten unique locality data points, except for isolona capuronii , i. pleurocarpa , monodora carolinae , m. globiflora , m. hastipetala  and m. stenopetala , all being rare or localized species. analysis of the variation of each bioclim variable between species underlines important ecological characteristics within and between species of each genus. for isolona, differences between east and west/central species were few  and included lower isothermality , higher temperature seasonality  and lower annual precipitation  for the east african species. in contrast, east african species of monodora showed differences for several variables when compared to the west/central african ones. for example, they are subject to lower isothermality , higher temperature seasonality  and lower annual precipitation  as well as other related variables such as bc <dig>  bc <dig>  bc <dig>  bc <dig> and bc <dig> . montane restricted taxa  such as isolona congolana, i. linearis and monodora globiflora are exposed to lower mean temperatures .

sister species comparisons: principal component analysis
environmental niches were compared between sister species using principal component analysis  on all  <dig> bioclim variables and significance between principal components were tested under mann-whitney u test. together, the first and second components explained between 59% and 87% of the variation among the  <dig> bioclim variables. the directionality of the loadings for components  <dig> and  <dig> were quite variable,  but in general, one axis was related to variation in precipitation while the other was related to temperature variation.

pca indicated environmental overlap between most pairs of sister species. three main patterns were observed: 1) species with narrower distributions were included within the environmental variation of a more widely distributed species  species that overlapped for part of their variation ; 3) species with clearly separated ecological space, which was found in just one species pair: monodora carolinae /m. stenopetala. for most comparisons one to two pc axes were not significantly different between species pairs . only the species pairs m. myristica /m. undulata and i. congolana /i. hexaloba were significantly different on all axes tested.

niche modeling
ecological niche modeling was undertaken on all sampled species using maxent  <cit> . the area under the curve  values for all species models ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   indicating reliable model performance . in four models  no standard deviation  was calculated, even though the respective aucs were high, because the number of total samples was too low . although several species in this study exhibited low sample sizes, the resulting aucs indicate that meaningful models have been produced . the maxent software has been documented to produce models with good predictive performance from small numbers of sample localities  <cit> .

the environmental variable that had the highest contribution to the prediction of each species when training the models  is reported in table s <dig>  response curves and variable importance were examined; however no general trends or consistent suite of variables were identified as the important factors for species' distributions.

sister species comparisons: niche similarity tests
potential distribution generated under enm using maxent between selected sister species are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and for all species in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  niche identity tests indicated significant ecological differentiation between all sister species  demonstrating that ecological niches between species pairs are not identical. in contrast, background tests indicated that in  <dig> of the  <dig> tests undertaken  ×  <dig>  × 11) the niches of sister species are more similar than expected by chance alone . in  <dig> cases, the results were not significantly different than the null distribution. finally,  <dig> comparisons showed less niche similarities than expected, namely two tests for the species pair monodora hastipetala /m. junodii, and all four tests for isolona heinsenii /i. linearis.

phylogenetic signal of climatic variables
two statistics were used to assess the phylogenetic signal of each bioclim variable: the quantitative convergence index  of ackerly et al.  <cit>  and the k of blomberg et al.  <cit> . tests were undertaken on each genus independently and then on the clade as a whole . the qvi varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in isolona,  <dig>  to  <dig>  in monodora and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the whole clade . the randomization tests on  <dig> posterior trees indicated that 9/ <dig> variables in isolona, 10/ <dig> variables in monodora and 14/ <dig> variables in the whole clade were significantly smaller than expected by chance  indicating strong correlation of those variables with the phylogeny. interestingly, variables identified with significant phylogenetic signal were not always the same between both genera. in isolona, temperature related variables showed more signal than precipitation ones , whereas in monodora precipitation variables showed more signal . for example, bc <dig>  presented the highest phylogenetic signal  within monodora whereas bc <dig>  showed the highest phylogenetic signal in isolona.

bold values indicate variables that are significantly different than expected from random .

the k statistic was higher than expected under a random evolutionary process  and showed phylogenetic signal  for  <dig> variables in isolona and just  <dig> in monodora . these variables were the same as identified under the qvi for each genus. only in isolona was one variable  detected as having a significant signal not found when using the qvi . when k was calculated for the clade as a whole all of the variables were lower than  <dig>  indicating a shortage of phylogenetic dependence under a random evolutionary model. however, 13/ <dig> showed significant values when compared to the random distribution of the variables on the tree. these were generally the same as those identified on the whole clade using the qvi. this would suggest that our data is robust to phylogenetic uncertainty because the mean qvi and its significance were based on  <dig> posterior trees .

phylogenetic signal of ecological divergence
an adaptation of the age-range correlation method following  <cit>  was used to test if there was a phylogenetic signal in ecological divergence using the niche similarity indices i and d  <cit> . the slope of the regression in isolona was negative supporting the idea of an increase in niche differences with phylogenetic distance. in contrast, monodora had a positive slope of the regression  which indicates that niche similarity among the species increases through time. however, neither of these analyses were significantly different than the null hypothesis  indicating the absence of a significant phylogenetic signal of the ecological niche.

discussion
ecological dimensions of speciation
this study is to our knowledge the first one explicitly using ecological niche models and phylogeny to understand speciation in a clade of african rain forest trees. our results indicate little geographical overlap between sister species . thus, most species pairs occur in allopatry, a result consistent with the geographical isolation hypothesis, although this would also be expected under the ecological gradient hypothesis. in one case the overlap was relatively large, for example between m. junodii and m. hastipelata . however, this might be an artifact in the way the overlap statistic was calculated  as both these species never grow in complete sympatry . monodora hastipelata is a local endemic to a small area in the matumbi hills in tanzania  <cit>  while m. junodii has an extensive distribution across east africa  <cit> .

most species pairs show visual overlap in ecological space  and are never completely separated by pca analysis . in contrast, the niche similarity tests  <cit>  based on the ecological niche models demonstrated that all species pair had highly significantly different niches . this test, however, is known to be very strict, and rejection of similarity can occur based on very small niche differences, especially for allopatric species  <cit> . at the scale studied here  the probability of two species having completely identical niches is very low  <cit>  and these tests might be too stringent, something already noted in other studies . the background tests appear better suited for this type of analyses and is generally used when species occur in allopatry  <cit> . just under half of the tests undertaken  supported the hypothesis of niche similarity between sister species whereas 13%  of the tests supported a significant difference. however, four of these latter tests were found for the species pair monodora junodii/m. hastipetala, and could be linked to the few data points associated with m. hastipetala . in several cases  a non-significant  result was found, which is suggestive of a lack of power to detect niche differentiation/similarity, either linked to a low sample size or to the distribution of the habitat  <cit> . ns results were found either between widely distributed species with a fair number of collections , suggesting habitat heterogeneity as a source of lack of power, or between species with a small number of collections .

finally, we also tested each bioclim variable for phylogenetic signal, i.e. the statistical nonindependence among species of the variables given their phylogenetic relationships. direct interpretation in terms of evolution of significant phylogenetic signal of traits is difficult and should be done with caution  <cit> . these tests yielded different results depending on the level of the analysis . nevertheless, both statistics identified several bioclim variables within each genus and for the clade as containing significant phylogenetic information . such a result was already suggested for monodora  <cit>  but not for isolona or the clade as a whole. however, it should be noted that for the genus tests the power of the randomization approach to detect significance of the k statistic might be slightly low for 14- <dig> tip phylogenies  <cit> . here, we do not attempt to draw strong conclusions about the rate of evolutionary change or the pattern of the evolutionary process linked to these variables. we simply underline that many variables are not randomly placed on the phylogeny and that they deviate from a random evolutionary process as generated under the brownian motion model . this is what would be expected under niche conservatism and the geographical speciation model, although exactly how they have influenced its diversification would require more in depth model fitting analyses  <cit> . in addition, we failed to identify any phylogenetic signal of ecological niche overlap   <cit> . absence of phylogenetic signal can be the result of a mixture in the speciation pattern  <cit> , or it may be directly related to the quality of the data. in monodora, the latter would appear to be the case as phylogenetic resolution within the west species is low, and specimen locality data from two sister species pair in east africa are few, both being sources of error.

the analyses at several levels using different approaches provide a mixed signal on the role of ecology in speciation. although sister species within this clade do not have identical niches, which is to be expected  <cit> , they are in several cases significantly more similar between each other than by chance alone . overall however, based on pca, ecological niche modeling and phylogenetic signal analyses, our results do provide some support to the idea that in terms of diversification, ecological speciation as viewed through climate has not played a major role in the evolution of isolona and monodora species. this contrasts with several recent publications where significant ecological divergence was generally demonstrated for northern hemisphere plant sister species such as in lonicera  <cit> , cyclamen  <cit> , five andean solanum species  <cit>  and in most clades of the south american genus hordeum  <cit> . they all concluded that ecological speciation was an important factor of diversification within these genera. moreover, in the mainly african distributed cucurbit genus coccinia, frequent biome shifts were inferred during a period of  <dig> ma between forest, woodland and semi arid habitats, implying an important role of ecological diversification  <cit> . finally, the spread of arid environments in africa during the neogene was suggested to be an important driver of diversification of some partially trf genera such as acridocarpus  <cit> . adaptation to alternative  environments appears extremely limited within isolona and monodora mainly because of the strong evolutionary constraint applied by the precipitation variables . a strong correlation between rainfall and species distribution was also found within neotropical annonaceae in general  <cit> .

the only species pair for which speciation might have relied on ecology is found in the east african species m. carolinae et m. stenopetala , the former occurring in moist semi-deciduous coastal forests of southern tanzania and mozambique while the latter is found in dense thickets and woodlands of malawi . however, the background test indicated that m. stenopetala had a significantly more similar niche when compared to the environmental background of m. carolinae . this result is quite intriguing given the important ecological differences identified using pca between these two species, and could be an artifact due to the low sample size of both species . it remains unclear exactly how many samples are necessary to produce a robust ecological niche model, although some authors have suggested more than  <dig>  <cit>  or even over  <dig> . also, these results could be due to the established background that was used for the tests, here defined as all grid cells within  <dig> km of known occurrence localities. the background tests are known to be sensitive to the definition of species 'background' and therefore a finer or coarser background region could yield different results  <cit> .

temporal dimensions of speciation
the estimated mean ages of the origin of species in both genera inferred by couvreur et al.  <cit>   are dated to before or at the beginning of the pleistocene . this would suggest that the pleistocene climatic fluctuations had little effect on species diversity within these genera. this result is intriguing because the geographical isolation hypothesis was thought to be especially important during the pleistocene because of the numerous successive rain forest expansion and fragmentation  <cit> . thus, although ecology plays a little role in the speciation processes of these genera in africa, the timing of these events pre dates a period of intensive climatic variation and hence potential isolation events. rather, most speciation events occurred in the late miocene and during the pliocene . it is important to note that these conclusions are based on the mean age for each node and that the 95% confidence intervals largely overlap with the pleistocene , and thus should be treated with caution. however, these estimates are in line with numerous other studies that have identified pre-pleistocene diversification in african trfs, such as in afromomum  <cit> , an estimated 60% of begonia species  <cit>  as well as in several animal clades such as african birds  <cit>  and african clawed frogs species  <cit> . this was also recorded for the genus coccinia  <cit> , although this genus is not restricted to trf. the late pliocene corresponds to a period of renewed rain forest re-expansion which was preceded by a fairly long period of aridification and savanna expansion during the late miocene  <cit> . in contrast, a recent temporal analysis of the herbaceous and mainly montane genus impatiens suggested an important role of pleistocene refuges on the diversification of the genus  <cit> . most of the studies that have detected  pleistocene diversification focused on herbaceous plant clades  which are known to have faster rates of molecular evolution when compared to woody taxa   <cit>  and or dispersal abilities. intraspecific analyses of genetic diversity  of widespread african tree  species  suggest that pleistocene refuges did have some effect but mainly at the infra specific genetic structure level only  <cit> . the small role of the pleistocene in generating species was also suggested to be the case in afromomum  <cit> . even though afromomum species are herbs, individuals can live up to  <dig> years which could imply lower molecular evolution  <cit>  when compared to other herbaceous taxa. the climatic variations of the past  <dig>  ma might have been too quick to allow allopatric speciation with little ecological divergence to operate, especially on organisms with lower rates of molecular evolution such as trees, something that is supported by our data as well as in other studies  <cit> . thus, the late miocene and pliocene epochs appear to have played a significant role in diversification of african trf trees possibly related to the longer phases of unfavorable climatic conditions and isolation of populations allowing proper genetic isolation between them.

CONCLUSIONS
although it is generally argued that ecology is never truly absent from speciation  <cit> , it is important to understand to what extent it can influence species production over time. our results imply that adaptation to climatic differences between sister species have not been a major driver of speciation in trees of african trfs, which is consistent with the geographical speciation model of trf diversification. such a result would seem to contrast with other patterns detected in non-trf plants. in the absence of other evidence, speciation in the studied genera could possibly be the result of intricate pollination mechanisms. indeed, both genera present strikingly different flower morphologies , and intra generic variation is also important  <cit> . unfortunately, to date, little information is available on african annonaceae pollination biology  <cit> , something that should be further explored.
