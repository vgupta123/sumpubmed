BACKGROUND
fungi from basidiomycetes group are known ligninolytic enzymes producers. lignin modifying enzymes  are rarely produced by bacteria, yeasts and most fungi but frequently occur in the fermented culture broth of white rot fungi  <cit> . white rot fungi  are so far exclusive in their potential to entirely degrade all the components of lignocellulosic materials and this capability is due to their extra cellular nonspecific lmes which function together with h2o <dig> and secondary metabolites. the aptitude of trametes versicolor to depolymerize lignin has been investigated from a physiological point of view. in p. chrysosporium and t. versicolor lignin peroxidases have been found to appear during the secondary metabolism  <cit> . lignin peroxidases  are glycosylated proteins that functionally require h2o <dig> for the oxidation of lignin related aromatic structures. a large number of substrates and by-products of lignin degradation, such as vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, veratric acid, and veratryl alcohol, have been tested for their ability to boost up ligninase activity  <cit> . veratryl alcohol a secondary metabolite produced by ligninolytic wrf plays an important role in lip catalysis. the kinetic analysis has revealed that cationic radical of veratryl alcohol converts lip  and/or lip  to lip and improves its catalytic cycle  <cit> . lips from various wrf including trametes versicolor and pleurotus ostreatu differ from the other oxidoreductases in that they have low ph optima varying between ph 2– <dig> and much higher redox potentials  <cit> .

lip is a biotechnologically important enzyme having potential applications to degrade highly toxic phenolic compounds from bleach plant effluents. lips and other ligninolytic enzymes from wrf find numerous applications in various industrial processes such as degradation of dyes, bioremediation, delignification for ethanol production, oxidation of organic pollutants, biosensors development, textile bio-finishing, beverage processing, wastewater detoxification, denim stone washing and detergent manufacturing  <cit> . significant efforts have been made to convert lignocellulosic residues to valuable products such as bio-fuels, chemicals and animal feed with the help of ligninolytic enzymes  of wrf, many of which have been successful.

enzyme immobilization has revolutionized the field of enzyme biotechnology. entrapment, adsorption and surface binding are the most frequently employed methods that have been applied recently for enzyme immobilization. entrapment is preferred over surface binding as this method is easier and cheaper and the structure of the enzyme remains secure  <cit> . recently, the physical characteristics of xerogels have been manipulated for enzyme immobilization. hydrophobic xerogels have the ability to produce enzymes in defined thin films that are thermo-stable and have the potential to catalyze reactions under wide environmental conditions  <cit> . moreover, xerogel polymers are non-toxic and do not swell in aqueous or organic solvents, thus preventing the leaching of entrapped enzyme and allowing the enzymes to maintain their native structures. immobilization of enzymes presents additional advantages including, improved resistance to thermal and chemical inactivation and remarkable storage and operational stability. in spite of the clear advantages of enzyme immobilization, only about 20% of bio-catalytic processes involve immobilized enzymes. however, over the last few years a number of interesting achievements and patent applications have been reported  <cit> , indicating that enzyme immobilization has entered into a thrilling new stage.

t. versicolor is one of the most potent lignin degrading microorganisms that produce extracellular peroxidases under optimum growth conditions  <cit> . the occurrence of the ligninolytic enzymes in the t. versicolor genome makes it an attractive fungus for miscellaneous biotechnological and environmental applications. in our previous studies  <cit> , we have successfully investigated the extracellular ligninolytic enzymes  synthesis potential of different locally isolated indigenous wrf strains including trametes versicolor ibl- <dig> under solid and liquid state fermentation based on varying lignocellulosic substrates and dye decolorization. although considerable work has been reported on lip from different fungal species but there are very few reports on purification, characterization and immobilization of lip produced from trametes versicolor. in this study for the first time t. versicolor ibl- <dig> lip was immobilized by xerogel entrapment method with an objective of dual phase characterization of novel thermo-stable lip to investigate its potential for industrial applications.

RESULTS
production of lip
t. versicolor ibl- <dig> was cultivated on solid substrate fermentation medium of corncobs moistened  with kirk’s basal medium of ph  <dig>  and incubated at 30°c for five days under previously optimized ssf growth conditions  <cit> . maximum lip activity of 592 ±  <dig> u/ml was recorded when corncobs supplemented with glucose and yeast extract in 25:1 c/n ratio, 1 ml of 1% tween- <dig> as surface active agent, and znso <dig> as metal ion source was inoculated with 5 ml freshly prepared spore suspension of t. versicolor ibl- <dig> and fermented for 5 days under still culture ssf conditions at 30°c. extracellular ligninolytic enzymes production is strongly influenced by the nature and amount of nutrients and microelements in the growth substrate. different wrf have particular responses to nutrients and show different growth and enzyme synthesis patterns during their growth on different substrates  <cit> . t. versicolor ibl- <dig> had an extraordinary potential to produced relatively higher amount of novel thermo-stable lip through ssf of corncobs than those described in literature for different strains of trametes versicolor, cunninghamella elegans and flavodon flavus <cit> .

purification of lip
the cell free crude enzyme extract had an initial lip activity of  <dig> u/200 ml and specific activity of  <dig> u/mg. lip was maximally precipitated out at 80% ammonium sulphate saturation with specific activity of  <dig> u/mg and  <dig> -fold purification. by sephadex g- <dig> column gel filtration chromatography, the enzyme was purified up to  <dig> -fold with specific activity of 440u/mg and its purification increased to  <dig> -fold with specific activity of  <dig> u/mg after passing through the deae-cellulose ion exchange column . mtui and nakamura  <cit>  achieved 50-80% 2so <dig> saturation, followed by chromatographic purification techniques for the recovery of pure lip. roushdy et al.  <cit>  achieved  <dig>  purification fold with specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg using sephadex g- <dig> gel permeation of lip after 80% ammonium sulfate saturation.

molecular mass estimation by electrophoresis
the purified lip was resolved on native and sds-page and found to be a homogenous monomeric protein, as evident by single homogenous band corresponding to 30 kda . the t. versicolor ibl- <dig> lip was different in molecular mass from previously reported lips from cunninghamella elegans and phanerochaete sordida yk- <dig>   <cit> , hexagona tenuis mtcc  <dig>   <cit> , flavodon flavus   <cit> , loweporus lividus mtcc- <dig>   <cit>  and trametes versicolor   <cit> .

immobilization of lip
the activity profiles of free and immobilized lips showed that specific activities of xerogel immobilized lip was  <dig>  fold higher as compared to free enzyme as shown in table  <dig>  the influence of enzyme concentration on the immobilization efficiency was studied using enzyme in the range of 2–10 mg/ml . the fraction containing 2 mg/ml enzyme  concentration showed maximum immobilization efficiency . the immobilization efficiency of gel matrix decreased to  <dig> % with increasing concentrations of enzyme . entrapment of lip in xerogel matrix involves adsorption phenomenon that has been reported as the best method for immobilization of enzymes  <cit> . previously, entrapment of lip from p. chrysosporium in xerogels caused hyperactivation but an increase in hydrophobic character above certain optimum limits caused a decrease in lip activity  <cit> . the results obtained by the xerogel entrapment method for the present lip immobilization are comparable to those obtained by other methods such as the covalent bonding of the enzyme on siliceous cellular foams , sepabeads ec-ep <dig> and dilbeads nk supports or immobilization by the formation of cross-linked enzyme aggregates  <cit> . however, the covalent binding strategy adopted in the above mentioned studies was much more expensive as compare to the xerogel matrix entrapment method due to the requirement of a coupling agent such as glutareldehyde.

characterization of free and immobilized lip
effect of ph on lip activity and stability
the ph-activity profile of free lip displayed optimal activity at ph  <dig> whereas, immobilization hyper-activated the lip and slightly shifted ph optima towards more acidic ph range. immobilization also enhanced the resistance of lip against ph variation. results of stability profile showed that free lip was only stable for 1 h in a ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and start loosing activity at higher ph values steadily. the xerogel entrapment enhanced the ph stability of lip for longer time period of 24 h that was much higher than the free enzyme . earlier studies  <cit>  reported optimum activities of various wrf lips to vary between ph 2– <dig>   reported that the lip produced from p. chrysosporium showed more than 80% of the maximum activity at optimum ph  <dig>  while according to  lip from p. chrysosporium was optimally active at ph  <dig> . it was observed that after immobilization, the optimum ph of lip was shifted slightly toward the acidic range possibly due to the buffering effect of the carrier surface. this phenomenon was also reported by , who observed a slight optimum ph shift from  <dig> to  <dig> for lip due to immobilization, but this smaller difference was due to the different method of immobilization, as well as the nature of the supporting matrix that was calyxarene.

effect of temperature on lip activity and stability
the free lip from t. versicolor ibl- <dig> was optimally active at 60°c and further increase in temperature caused its deactivation, while xerogel entrapped lip showed optimum activity at temperatures higher than 60°c. as compared to free enzyme xerogel entrapped lip had an extraordinary thermo-stability for up to 24 h incubation at 80°c without losing much of its activity . as compared to previously reported lips the t. versicolor ibl- <dig> lip had greater thermo-stability suggesting its potential for biotechnological applications. relatively greater activity and high thermo-stability are attractive and desirable characteristics of an enzyme for industrial applications  <cit> . lip from loweporus lividus mtcc- <dig> was optimally active at 24°c  <cit> , lip from p. chrysosporium showed better thermo-stability and was optimally active at 55°c  <cit> , and that from p. chrysosporium was stable at 34°c  <cit> . immobilization to a solid support causes changes in the enzyme conformation and thus increases stability towards heat denaturation. similar hyper-thermostablization of other enzymes in hydrophobic xerogels has also previously been reported  <cit> .

effect of substrate concentration: determination of km and vmax
varying concentrations of veratryl alcohol  were plotted against the respective initial specific activities  of free and immobilized lip. michalis-menten kinetics yielded a hyperbolic curve. lineweaver-burk double reciprocal plots  were constructed. the km and vmax values for free lip were 70 μm and  <dig> u/mg as compared to 56 μm and  <dig> u/mg, respectively for immobilized lip. the lower value of km and higher vmax values for immobilized enzyme indicated that immobilization enhanced the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of lip.  reported that immobilized enzymes have the best catalyzing power as well as good interaction for their substrate. there is slight difference in the km and vmax values for t. versicolor ibl- <dig> lip than other reported lips. the km values for veratryl alcohol and h2o <dig> for lip from loweporus lividus mtcc- <dig> were  <dig> and 83 mm, respectively  <cit> . in another study the km for lip was 167 μm using veratryl alcohol as substrate  <cit> .

effect of activators/inhibitors on free and immobilized lip
the stimulatory/inhibitory effects of different organic compounds  and metal ions  on free and entrapped lip was investigated. results showed that lip was completely inhibited by cystein while it was partially inhibited with edta. among the metal ions used, only ag+ caused lip inhibition to variable extent whereas, cu2+ and fe2+ were activators of lip at low concentration whereas . the xerogel entrapped lip was found to exhibit significant tolerance against inactivation by cystein, edta and ag+. edta is a metal chelating agent that has ability to bind the inorganic prosthetic groups of enzymes leading to inhibitory effect on enzymes. in many previous studies metal ions like hg2+ and ag+ have been reported as stronger inhibitors of extra cellular peroxidases of wrf, while fe3+, ca2+ and ni2+ did not cause any alteration in lip activity  <cit> . low concentrations of heavy metals ions are necessary for the development of the ligninolytic enzyme system of various wrf. addition of zn2+ and cu2+ into the cultivation medium at low concentrations has been reported to increase lip activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, t. versicolor ibl- <dig> showed tremendous potential for lip synthesis in ssf of corncobs in high titters , than previously reported trametes species. the extracellular lip from t. versicolor ibl- <dig> had lowered molecular as compare to most wrf lips. t. versicolor ibl- <dig> lip successfully immobilized with immobilization efficiency of  <dig> % by xerogel entrapment in a matrix of tmos and ptms. dual phase characterization showed that immobilization enhanced lip activity, stability over broad ph range  and thermotolerance in 20-80°c temperature range for extended time period of 24 h. immobilization also enhanced the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of lip as evidenced by lower km and high vmax values. the xerogel entrapped lip had significantly higher tolerance against inactivating agents as compared to free enzyme. results of dual phase characterization suggested that xerogel matrix entrapment is a promising tool for hyper-activation and stabilization of lip making it a valuable and versatile enzyme for various industrial and biotechnological applications.
