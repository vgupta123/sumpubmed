BACKGROUND
aeromonas salmonicida is one of the predominant bacterial species found in fish and water samples  <cit> . while some aeromonas species are able to cause opportunistic disease in warm- and cold blooded vertebrates, a. salmonicida seems to be specific for fish. aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida a specific primary pathogen of salmonidae  has been known for decades to cause furunculosis. this bacterial septicaemia has a significant economic impact on aquaculture operations as well as on the wild stock of salmonids and some other fish species  <cit> . bergey’s manual of systematic bacteriology recognizes five subspecies of a. salmonicida: salmonicida, achromogenes, smithia, pectinolytica and masoucida <cit> . aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is referred to as typical aeromonas salmonicida by reason that these strains are very homogeneous and considered to be clonal  <cit> . clinical strains that cannot be assigned to any of the known subspecies are referred to as a. salmonicida ‘atypical’. in recent years, it has been recognized that ‘atypical’ strains cause diseases in salmonidae and other fish species that differ from furunculosis. therefore their importance is being increasingly recognized. the most common clinical manifestation observed, following infections with such strains, is chronic skin ulceration  <cit> . due to a convoluted history of nomenclature and taxonomy of aeromonas sp., clear assignment of strains using currently available methods remains sometimes confusing and controversial which makes epidemiological studies difficult  <cit> . intraspecies phenotypic variability also makes phenotypic identification challenging on the species level  <cit> . a variety of molecular genetic methods have been employed for genetic classification of aeromonads including mol% g + c composition, dna-dna relatedness studies, restriction fragment length polymorphism, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, plasmid analysis, ribotyping, multilocus sequence typing, pcr and more  <cit> . combination of 16s rdna-rflp analysis and sequencing of the gene rpod was proposed as a suitable approach for the correct assignment of aeromonas strains  <cit> . moreover, analyzing strains by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  with an extraction method revealed 100% genus-level accuracy and  <dig> % accuracy at species level  <cit> . however, this method was not able to discriminate a. salmonicida at the subspecies level.

currently, no molecular approach gives a clear genotypic distinction of strains among a. salmonicida species. for this reason we elaborated a molecular genetic technique to achieve an adequate subtyping of all aeromonas salmonicida subspecies. this method, named high copy number is-element based restriction fragment length polymorphism , has been successfully applied in numerous epidemiological studies for other pathogenic bacteria  <cit> .

RESULTS
optimization of hcn-is630-rflp conditions
is <dig> was selected because it is the is element with the highest copy number in the genome of a. salmonicida <cit> . primers internal to the highly conserved is <dig> genes  were designed to generate a probe on an intact is fragment from the a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida jf <dig> genome. to obtain the most distinct banding pattern, the digestion by several restriction enzymes on a set of sequenced genomes  was predicted by computer analysis. xhoi that does not cut within our probe for is <dig> revealed a good resolution with a clear banding pattern and was therefore selected. a size window of 1375 bp to 21226 bp was defined on all southern blots as some hybridizing patterns with very large or small fragments were not sufficiently resolved . the genomic dna sequence of a. salmonicida strain a <dig>  predicted that the probe would hybridize with  <dig> copies of is <dig> on xhoi fragments ranging from 1277 bp to 17948 bp .

we analyzed the is <dig> rflp-fingerprints of  <dig> aeromonas sp. strains of various geographical origins, which comprised  <dig> a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida,  <dig> subsp. achromogenes,  <dig> subsp. smithia,  <dig> subsp. masoucida, one subsp. pectinolytica,  <dig> a. salmonicida atypical strains,  <dig> a. popoffii,  <dig> a. sobria and a. bestiarum,  <dig> a. hydrophila, one a. trota, a. enteropelogenes, a. simiae, a. eucrenophila, a. ichthiosmia, a. jandaei, a. molluscorum, a. bivalvium, a. allosaccharophila, a. media, a. veronii, a. caviae and a. culicicola . the fingerprints  of the analyzed strains were subjected to similarity analysis and are shown in figure  <dig> 

nd: not determined.

hcn-is630-rflp profiles and stability of is <dig> insertions
a high degree of is <dig> polymorphism, both in a numerical and positional sense, was observed between the various a. salmonicida subspecies . however, the patterns revealed that is <dig> copy numbers and positions are well conserved within the given subspecies . the dendogram in figure  <dig> is a rflp tree that reveals the evolutionary relationship between strains analyzed. strains of the subspecies salmonicida, smithia, achromogenes and masoucida each grouped together showing a similar banding pattern. the number of is630-positive bands varied from  <dig> to  <dig> in a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida,  <dig> to  <dig> in achromogenes and  <dig> to  <dig> in smithia. within a subspecies, several bands were conserved:  <dig> in salmonicida,  <dig> in achromogenes and  <dig> in smithia subspecies. about  <dig> distinct patterns were observed in a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida without showing geographical association. the is <dig> pattern of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strain a <dig> as calculated from the genome sequence data closely clusters with these  <dig> patterns. in contrast, each pattern in the achromogenes cluster was different. in a. salmonicida subsp. masoucida  <dig> to  <dig> positive bands were detected and only  <dig> in the subspecies pectinolytica. even though the copy numbers vary within the subspecies, the patterns form clusters for each subspecies. the most remarkable tight clustering was found for a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. this latter presents is <dig> patterns that only show minute differences among strains that were isolated from various continents and over a period of half a century. no pattern was specific of a given geographical region. the results showed also that strains jf <dig> and jf <dig>  formerly classified as a. salmonicida atypical, clustered with a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida  and subsp. achromogenes   showing that they were misclassified previously.

the is <dig> pattern of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strain jf  <dig> that was subcultured for 4 days at 18°c and 25°c  to reach approximately  <dig> generations remained unchanged  indicating a good stability of is <dig> under experimental growth conditions.

copy number of the is <dig> element and rflp among other aeromonas species
other aeromonas species revealed lower copy numbers of is630:  <dig> in a. molluscorum,  <dig> to  <dig> in clinical a. sobria strains,  <dig> in a. veronii,  <dig> in a. allosaccharophila and a. media. only one copy was found in a. bivalvium and a clinical strain of a. hydrophila. no signal for is <dig> was obtained in a. caviae, a. trota, a. simiae, a. eucrenophila, a. ichthiosmia, a. jandaei, a. culicicola, a. enteropelogenes, a. bestiarum and the type strains of a. hydrophila and a. sobria. among the  <dig> strains of a. popoffii we found  <dig> very distinct patterns.

analysis of is <dig> abundance, localization and impact on the genome of aeromonas species
in order to study the origin of is <dig> in a. salmonicida, we performed a profound analysis and comparison of published aeromonas genomes . the genetic environment of is <dig> copies in the a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida a <dig> genome is shown in detail in additional file 1: table s <dig>  about  <dig> loci or dna sequences forming  <dig> complete or partial is units were found in the chromosome of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida a <dig> and on the plasmids pasa4/pasa <dig> . is <dig>  was found to be present in  <dig> copies and was the most abundant family representing 35% of transposons in a. salmonicida a <dig> . the different copies are well-conserved and show 98% nucleotide sequences identity. the other  <dig> is elements are isas <dig> , isas <dig> , isas <dig> , isas <dig> , isas <dig> , isas <dig> , isas <dig> , and unclassified isas  . 90% of the is <dig> copies reside in chromosomal regions that are specific to a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and were not found in other aeromonas. interestingly most of these loci correspond to known genes in bacterial genera other than aeromonas. this is the case for instance for the hypothetical gene asa_ <dig>  that is directly linked to is <dig> in a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and is not found in other aeromonads . in isas families other than is <dig>   <dig>  are directly adjacent to is <dig> showing that 66% of a. salmonicida a <dig> transposons are associated to genomic domains of variability. in comparison to other aeromonas sp., a. salmonicida a <dig> contains  <dig> to  <dig> fold more transposases  which are not responsible for a genome-reductive evolution  <cit>  because the total number of orfs is stable in comparison to other aeromonads . however they explain the high abundance of pseudogenes  in a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida <cit>  in contrast to a. hydrophila atcc  <dig> which only contains  <dig> pseudogenes and  <dig> transposases.

discussion
hcn-is6110-rflp has been applied as a standard method to subtype mycobacterium tuberculosis strains for years  <cit> . moreover, rflp based on is elements has been employed to type numerous other pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the published genome of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida a <dig> shows numerous is elements among which  <dig> belong to the is <dig> family . we therefore used hcn-is630-rflp as a new typing methodology for aeromonas species.

is <dig> was present in different copy numbers and integrated at various sites between the different a. salmonicida subspecies. on the other hand banding patterns were conserved within subspecies . hcn-is630-rflp revealed that is <dig> is abundant in all subspecies of a. salmonicida allowing a good accuracy for genomic fingerprinting. our results showed that rflp profiles can be used to distinguish subspecies of a. salmonicida and to differentiate a. salmonicida from other aeromonas species. they also indicate a high variability among strains of ‘atypical’ a. salmonicida. all strains of yet unclassified ‘atypical’ a. salmonicida consisted of a high number of is <dig> copies and were effectively related to the a. salmonicida cluster. our method demonstrates that such ‘atypical’ strains represent a heterogeneous group that does not fit into the classification of the five described a. salmonicida subspecies. these strains might represent various subtypes of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida or novel subspecies of a. salmonicida that have adapted to particular ecological niches or respective hosts. on the other hand, all a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida isolated since the 1950s and originating from all over the world have very similar patterns, indicating that they form a single clone showing pathoadaptational stability. altogether, our results confirm those of a previous study comparing genomic profiles of clinical isolates of aeromonas salmonicida using dna microarrays  <cit> . with the origin and intensification of fish farming, genetic rearrangements occurring through is transposition events could have been responsible for the selection and the emergence of this pathogenic fish specific clone. such an adaptation process of a pathogenic bacterium towards its host was recently indicated in the mycoplasma mycoides cluster for mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides <cit> . moreover, no unique pattern was associated to a specific geographical region of the world and we assume that this could be explained by the dissemination of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains between aquaculture countries via the intensification of the international trade in farmed salmon or by the natural migration of wild salmons.

besides the epidemiologic and phylogenetic interests of is <dig> fingerprinting to subtype a. salmonicida, we studied the characteristics of this predominant is element to reveal information concerning the pathoadaptation towards its specific host. mobile genetic elements can exert different effects on bacterial genomes  <cit> . through such genomic effects, is <dig> family has had an impact on the modulation of virulence genes in other bacteria  <cit> . in a. salmonicida 90% of the is <dig> copies reside in genomic regions that are variable between aeromonas sp.  and 80% of these sites contain genes that are specific to a. salmonicida and are not encountered in other aeromonas sp. suggesting that they constitute genomic islands. a part of these coding sequences are phages or hypothetical genes with homologues of characterized sequences in other environmental bacteria: i.e. the ‘vibrio seventh pandemic cluster i’ , genes for the synthesis of polysaccharide capsule, lipopolysaccharide, s-layer, chitinase, cytolytic insecticidal delta-endotoxin, and some effectors  of the type-three secretion system, the major virulence system of the bacterium. based on these findings we assume that is <dig> elements could be used by environmental bacteria to exchange dna fragments between each other by horizontal transfer. in the genomic islands where is <dig> is present, supplementary is elements can be found, which might serve as hot spots for further insertions. this would allow the transposon and the genomic island to evolve with acquisition of new genes without disruption of existing loci. these observations could explain why the is <dig> elements remained stable within the a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida genome.

other interesting characteristics of is elements homologous to is <dig> in a. salmonicida suggest that they could play a role in the co-adaptation of the bacterium with its host by trans-kingdom horizontal gene transfers through the bacterial t3ss:  such is <dig> elements are mostly present in gram-negative bacteria that use a t3ss,  their expression can be specifically induced or increased when bacteria are in direct contact with host cells  <cit>  and  several is <dig> are predicted to be t3ss effectors  <cit> . the modlab® t3ss effector prediction software gives for a. salmonicida is <dig> a positive output at  <dig>  which means, that the is <dig> itself is a potential t3ss effector. hence, when the bacteria colonize the host, the is <dig> expression could be induced and they could begin to exert their transposase activity by excising the transposon  from the bacterial genome. subsequently, the transposase linked to its transposon could be translocated into the host cell by the t3ss, reach the host genome in the nucleus, and finally perform its transposition.

bacterial is <dig> elements constitute with the tc1/mariner eukaryotic dna transposon family, a superfamily  <cit> . it was demonstrated in vitro that eukaryotic members of this family are able to transpose into prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . we suppose that the opposite could also be possible as is <dig> itself could be translocated via type three secretion system from the pathogen to its host. in this perspective, our assumption could explain how the adaptive horizontal transfer of a bacterial mannanase gene  into the genome of an invasive insect pest of coffee  occurred in the immediate genetic vicinity of a tc1/mariner transposon  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we describe hcn-is630-rflp as an adequate method for subtyping a. salmonicida strains and to differentiate a. salmonicida from other aeromonas species. the high degree of conservation of hcn-is630-rflp profiles among strains of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida isolated from geographically most distant areas and over the period of half a century shows that practically all copies of is <dig> are stably integrated in this pathogen that has a well-defined host range. we therefore conclude that is <dig> might have contributed to the pathoadaptation of a. salmonicida to salmonidae and to the emergence of the subtype a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
