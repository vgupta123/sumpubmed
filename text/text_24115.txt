BACKGROUND
temporal lobe epilepsy  is pathologically characterized by extensive neuronal loss in the ca <dig>  ca <dig> and hilar regions of hippocampus  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that the animal models of tle generated by intracerebroventricular injection of kainic acid  faithfully reproduce clinical and pathological features found in human tle  <cit> .

previous studies have reported the possible involvement of neurotrophic factors in epilepsy as suggested by the gene expression of neurotrophic factors such as ngf, bdnf and nt- <dig> in hippocampus in human tle as well as in tle animal models  <cit> . midkine , one of such neurotrophic factors, has emerged as an important neuromodulator in the central nervous system . mk, a member of the heparin-binding growth factor family, which includes mk and pleiotrophin, is known to possess neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties  <cit> . mk was originally isolated as the product of retinoic acid-responsive gene that functions primarily in inducing cell differentiation in mouse teratocarcinoma cells  <cit> , and has the ability to influence a variety of neuronal functions including neurite extension  <cit> , neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and neuronal survival following injury or damage in the cns  <cit> . during the fetal development of the cns, mk expression was demonstrated in neuroepithelial/neural progenitor cells following ethylnitrosourea injury  <cit>  indicating that mk might have a role in cellular proliferation  <cit> . recent studies further showed that mk has been implicated in neurological diseases, including alzheimer's disease  <cit> , cerebral ischemia  <cit>  and parkinson-dementia complex of guam   <cit> . in patients with alzheimer's disease  <cit>  or lytico-bodig disease  <cit> , mk immunoreactivity was found in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. in addition, an increased expression of mk was found in astrocytes in rat models of cerebral ischemia  <cit> . it is not known, however, whether the expression of mk in the brain after the brain injury is a part of an endogenous repair process to prevent further damage in the cns.

the objectives of the present study are to determine whether intracerebroventricularly injected mk acts as an anticonvulsant and blocks ka-mediated neuronal cell death in hippocampus.

RESULTS
mk expression after seizures
we first examined mk expression immunohistochemically in mouse hippocampus following ka injection. injection of ka  to mice induced severe epileptiform seizures . basal level of mk immunoreactivity was found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in control mouse brain injected with vehicle  , while in mouse injected with ka decreased mk expression was detected in pyramidal neurons ; nissl staining of the adjacent sections confirmed that the cellular area of decreased mk immunoreactivity was associated with damaged pyramidal neurons . nissl staining in control animals receiving pbs injection showed no evident neuronal damage .

interestingly, we have found the number of mk-positive cells markedly increased in stratum lacunosum moleculare  area of ca <dig> at 24-hr post-ka injection relative to pbs controls. representative mk immunostaining in ca <dig> slm is shown in figure 1b . in pbs-injected brain, only small number of mk-positive cells was observed . following injection of ka, ca <dig> slm area demonstrated an increase in the number of mk-positive cells . double-labeling immunofluorescence staining was then used to investigate mk expression in glial cells in ka-injected hippocampus. representative double staining for mk  and gfap  showed that mk was expressed in gfap-positive astrocytes; there was no mk expression in anti-complement receptor  <dig> -positive microglia .

quantification of mk expression data  showed that ka injection significantly decreased mk immunoreactivity by 44% in sp area relative to pbs-injected control. however, the mk immunoreactivity in animals with ka injection markedly increased by 651% in slm area as compared to pbs-injected control.

anticonvulsant effect of mk
to further investigate the role of mk in ka-injected hippocampus, we examined the potential protective effects of mk against ka-induced seizures and neurotoxicity. seizure onset was approximately  <dig> sec following ka injection, which lasted for mean  <dig>  sec . the intensity of seizures reached mean score  <dig>   when the seizure activity was highest . interestingly, seizure duration and intensity were markedly reduced by co-administration of mk in a dose-dependent manner, although the time of onset time slightly delayed at a high dose . seizure duration and intensity were shortened and attenuated to  <dig>  -  <dig> % and  <dig>  -  <dig> % of the control levels by treatment with ka , respectively.

neuroprotective effect of mk
representative nissl staining  <dig> hr following ka injection showed considerable neuronal loss in the hippocampal subregions, ca <dig> and hilus of the dentate gyrus as compared to pbs control . mk treatment was effective in reducing neuronal loss in ka-injected hippocampus as shown in a representative finding in a high dose  group . the extent of degeneration of hippocampal neurons was quantified in hippocampal subregions, ca <dig>  ca <dig>  and hilus . the number of hippocampal neurons was significantly reduced in ca <dig>  and hilus  by ka exposure, whereas ca <dig> region  was relatively spared when compared with pbs control. co-application of mk increased survival of neurons in ka-injected hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner, leading to significant improvements at ka doses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/mouse.

next we investigated the efficacy of mk to block the ka-induced cell death of gabaergic interneurons . a previous study has reported that gad67-positive interneurons are lost in the hippocampus in ka-injected animal model of excitotoxicity  <cit> . animals receiving ka injection showed significant reduction in the number of gad67-positive interneurons in subfields of ca <dig> , ca <dig>  and layers of dentate gyrus  as compared to pbs control . administration of mk  reduced the cell loss in gad67-positive neurons caused by ka injection and this neuroprotective effect of mk was evident in the subfields of ca <dig> and layers of dentate gyrus . application of mk markedly increased survival of gad67-positive neurons in the strata pyramidale , radiatum  of ca <dig> and molecular layer , granule cell layer , and dentate hilus  of dentate gyrus, whereas neurons in subfields of ca <dig> was not effectively preserved .

discussion
the main finding of this study is that intracerebroventricular administration of mk conferred neuroprotection against ka-induced excitotoxic cell death of hippocampal neurons. our results also demonstrated that mk was effective in attenuating ka-induced seizures and degeneration of gabaergic interneurons in hippocampus. the results from immunohistochemical staining showed that damaged pyramidal neurons in hippocampus are correlated with the decreased level of mk expression . at present, it is not known whether this reduced level of mk immunoreactivity in neurons is causative factor for neuronal degeneration induced by ka injection. however, previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that mk is an effective neuroprotective agent in reducing retinal degeneration caused by excessive light  <cit>  and decreasing hippocampal neuronal death in ischemic gerbil brain  <cit> . furthermore, mk knock-out mice displayed altered expression of calcium-binding protein in hippocampus and defective working memory  <cit> . in view of these observations, it is possible that mk is involved in the regulation of endogenous neuroprotective process against externally applied injury or disease.

we have found that the level of mk immunoreactivity markedly increased in astrocytes after ka injection . in a previous report, we have demonstrated rapid activation of astrocytes in hippocampal alveus and fimbria, strata oriens and lacunosum moleculare as well as dentate hilus as early as  <dig> hr following diisopropyl fluorophosphate -induced seizures and neuronal injury  <cit> . these observations suggest that the activated astrocytes serve as an important source of mk in response to excitotoxicity. important findings in the present study are therapeutic and neuroprotective effects of mk on ka-induced neuronal injury in ca <dig> and dentate hilus of hippocampus . our results are in good agreement with a previous study of neuroprotective effect of mk in transient forebrain ischemia when given immediately before middle cerebral artery occlusion  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that ka-injected brain show dramatic reduction in the number of gad-positive interneurons  <cit> , even in ca <dig> statum oriens and alveus where pyramidal neurons are relatively spared  <cit> , which can cause abnormal functional inhibition of neuronal circuitry leading to hippocampal hyperexcitability  <cit> . thus, it is noteworthy that icv application of mk blocks the degeneration of gad67-positive interneurons, especially in the stratum pyramidale and radiatum of ca <dig>  and the molecular layer, granule cell layer and hilus of dentate gyrus as caused by ka injection .

the majority of the animals experienced stage 4/ <dig> seizure severity after ka injection. a previous study has demonstrated in ka-injected rat epilepsy model that dizocilpine  inhibited hippocampal neuronal loss without blocking seizure development  <cit> . in addition, several studies in animal model of tle have also shown that significant neuronal loss is not necessarily a prerequisite for the development of seizures  <cit> . such results imply that the mechanism of mk action in tle model is different from that of mk- <dig>  an nmda antagonist. our results show that mk-induced neuroprotection against ka toxicity is primarily associated with moderation of seizure activity . it is believed that mk plays a role as an anticonvulsant directly  or indirectly by preserving an inhibitory amino acid  system including gad67-positive interneurons . furthermore, it is possible to speculate that mk could be a neurotrophic factor, especially for gad67-positive interneurons or astrocytes expressing high levels of mk  which may contribute to early cessation of seizure and control of its recurrence.

the exact mechanism of the neuroprotective activity of mk remains to be further clarified but activation of gene product associated with apoptosis by mk may provide some answers. for instance, previous studies have shown that mk inhibits apoptotic process by up-regulation of bcl- <dig> expression  <cit>  and by inhibition of caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the mk-mediated neuroprotective mechanism involves activation of signal transduction pathways involved in regulation of apoptotic cell death.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study demonstrate that the administration of mk produces a significant neuroprotective effect against ka-induced neuronal loss in mouse model of epilepsy. additional studies of mk to elucidate their neuroprotective activity in animal models of brain injury and neurodegeneration such as parkinson's disease, huntington's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, stroke or spinal cord injury should prove mk as a member of neurotrophic factors that are valuable in providing effective treatment for patients with various neurological disorders.
