BACKGROUND
microarrays are part of a new class of biotechnologies that allow the monitoring of the expression level of thousands of genes simultaneously. among the applications of microarrays, an important task is the identification of differentially expressed genes, i.e genes whose expressions are associated with the status of the patient .

the biological question of the identification of differentially expressed genes can be restated as a one  or two-sample  hypothesis testing procedure: is the gene differentially expressed between the two situations? however, when thousands of genes in a microarray data set are evaluated simultaneously by fold changes or significance tests approach, multiple testing problems immediately arise and lead to many false positive genes. in this 'one-by-one gene' approach the probability of detecting false positives rises sharply.

the false discovery rate , is defined as the expected fraction of false rejections among those hypotheses rejected. in their seminal paper benjamini & hochberg  <cit>  provided a distribution free procedure  for choosing a threshold on p-values that guarantees that the fdr is less than a target level α. the same paper demonstrated that the bh procedure is more powerful than the bonferroni method that controls the familywise error rate.

the fdr gives an idea of the expected number of false positive hypotheses that a practitioner can expect if the experiment is done an infinite number of time. as usual with expectation, it gives very little information about the number of false discovery hypotheses in a given experiment.

motivation
the value of  <dig>   <dig> or 10% for the fdr, which determines the threshold t, is arbitrary. storey and tibshirani  <cit>  stressed the importance of assessing to each feature its own measure of significance. they proposed to use the q-value,



where pi is the p-value of the ordered gene i, ri is the total number of rejected genes whose p-values are less than the threshold t = pi and  is an estimate of the total number of non differentially expressed genes, m <dig> 

the q-value is appealing because it gives a measure of significance that can be attached to each gene, but it must be stressed that it is not an estimate of the probability for the gene to be a false positive. the q-value is generally lower than the latter because it is computed using all the genes that are more significant than gene i. obviously a gene whose p-value is near to the threshold t does not have the same probability to be differentially expressed than a gene whose p-value is close to zero. therefore the q-value gives a too optimistic view of the probability for the gene to be a false positive.

therefore it is interesting to obtain an estimate of the fdr attached to each gene, called local fdr, from an inferential point of view and without any assumption about the distribution of the p-values under h <dig> 

RESULTS
let

h <dig> = {gene i is not differentially expressed}.

let the local fdr be the probability that a given gene is not differentially expressed. more specifically, fdr is the probability that a gene, whose p-value is pi, is not differentially expressed, taking into account the whole set of tests. a raw local fdr estimate is defined in a first step. in a second step the local fdr estimate is defined as a smoothed value based on the raw values.

let p <dig> < … <pm denote the ordered p-values for testing h <dig>  the raw local fdr estimate for gene i is:



where



where λ is a tuning parameter and w = #{i, pi > λ}, see storey  <cit> .

assume that the p-values for the non-differentially expressed genes are independent. the raw local fdr estimate has the following properties:

• under h <dig> and h <dig> and if e() = m <dig>   is unbiased with mean  <dig> 

• let  = m <dig>  under h <dig> and h <dig> and if m <dig> is known, v) = / ≈  <dig>  for m <dig> large enough. this value is a lower bound for v) when m <dig> is unknown.

• the variance of the raw local fdr under h <dig> is generally much smaller than under h <dig> 

•  where qj is the q-value of gene j. the q-value may thus be viewed as the mean of the local fdr of the genes with p-values lower than pj.

 is generally a very variable estimator. moreover the local fdr should increase with the p-value. this is not the case for the raw local fdr. therefore it is necessary to use a smoothed estimate.

the smoothed local fdr is



where fi is a smoothing function of the  for j =  <dig>  m, computed at position pi.

 gives a very valuable guideline for the choice of a threshold. one may consider the curve of the local fdr versus the index of the gene ordered by their p-values: a good candidate for the threshold should be a point with a high second order derivative, which corresponds to an abrupt change in the slope of the curve . the second order derivative of the smoothed local fdr can be computed numerically using finite differences.

as an interesting application of the local fdr, it is possible to compute the fdr associated with a class of genes or clones by summing up the local fdr estimate of each clone or gene: one may consider for example clones corresponding to the same gene, genes known involved in a given regulatory network, or gene from the same chromosomic region, and associate a fdr with the whole class. these genes do not need to have consecutive p-values. the following sections demonstrate how the local fdr can be useful using the data of well known experiments.

local fdr on golub data set
golub  <cit>  were interested in identifying genes that are differentially expressed in patients with two types of leukemias . gene expression levels were measured using affymetrix high-density chips containing  <dig> human genes. the learning set comprises  <dig> all cases and  <dig> aml cases.

data are available in the r multtest package. we used the preprocessing proposed by the authors and the p-values based on random permutations of the all/aml labels on welch t-statistics for each gene, dudoit  <cit> , on the  <dig> remaining genes. m <dig> is estimated with bootstrap method as suggested by storey and tibshirani and implemented in the library genets of software r.

we can see that there is an abrupt change of the smoothed local fdr around gene number  <dig> which corresponds to a threshold t =  <dig>  for the p-value. this may be an indication about the threshold. the figure  <dig> presents a zoom of the figure  <dig> for the first  <dig> p-values. we can see in figure  <dig> that if we select the  <dig>  top genes, we obtain a q-value equal to  <dig>  while the 438th gene has a local fdr equal to  <dig> . it must be noticed that there is a big difference between the two measures of fdr because the numerous regulated genes with very small p-values have a great influence on the q-value, which is not the case of the local fdr ).

the p-values have been obtained using random permutations. therefore the p-values are discrete with several genes possessing the same p-value. therefore the values of  may be equal to  <dig> because the difference between two successive p-values is  <dig>  the discrete structure of the p-values implies a departure from the theoretical continuous uniform distribution. this explains why the moving average smoothing creates discrete jumps which appear in figure  <dig> 

if the distribution of the statistics under h <dig> is correct, the p-values are distributed as a uniform distribution over  <cit> . the empirical distribution of the high observed p-values  is far from the uniform distribution. there are several non-exclusive possibilities to explain this: more than 50% of the genes are differentially expressed, the gene results for non-differentially expressed are correlated or there is a technical problem in the random permutations of the welch t-statistics.

local fdr on breast cancer data set
storey and tibshirani  <cit> , have analysed in detail data from hedenfalk  <cit>  on  <dig> microarrays on breast cancer. using the same p-values, we have computed local fdr estimates. the three genes which have been analysed in detail by storey and tibshirani  <cit>  are presented in table  <dig> 

one can see that the smooth local fdr estimate is generally greater than the q-value and gives a better idea of the probability that a gene is a false positive. for example, at the level of 5%, ctgf will be considered as differentially expressed on the basis of the q-value while it will be considered as non differentially expressed using the local fdr.

setting λ =  <dig> , storey and tibshirani  <cit>  estimate that 67% of the  <dig> genes in the data are not differentially expressed. the asymptote near  <dig> of the smooth curve supports this estimation.

local fdr on apoai data
the goal of the study is to identify genes with altered expression in the livers of two lines of mice with very low hdl cholesterol levels compared to inbred control mice. the mouse model is the apolipoprotein ai  knock-out mice. apoai is a gene known to play a pivotal role in hdl metabolism. the statistical analysis is described in dudoit  <cit> . height clones are expected to be differentially expressed between the control and the knock-out mices because they are clones of the apoai gene or of genes coregulated with apoai. the height clones are actually the  <dig> top clones detected by the statistical tests. however there are other following clones which seem statistically significant if we consider the q-value. we can see on the figure  <dig> that the local fdr values are much higher than the q-values.

there are two clones of the gene apo-ai. if we want to estimate the fdr of these two clones taken in a whole, we compute the mean of the smoothed local fdr of the two clones  and obtain a local fdr for the gene apo-ai, which is equal to . this example shows that it is possible to estimate the local fdr of any group of clones. this opportunity provided by the local fdr is certainly one of its major advantage with many potential applications.

discussion
the curve of the smoothed local fdr is an efficient tool to summarize the information about the number and the statistical significance of differentially expressed genes, and may also be used to give an indication about the validity of the statistical assumptions. moreover it is a valuable tool to choose the threshold for separating the differentially expressed genes from the non-differentially expressed one: one can choose a value of t maximizing the second derivative. alternatively one can use a cost function and choose the threshold that minimizes the mean cost for a given cost function: using cost of the experiment, cost of false positive gene validation and the profit of discovering a differentially expressed gene, it is direct to compute the optimal strategy for choosing the threshold.

note that a decision rule based on the local fdr would lead to a different set of selected genes than the usual one obtained by controlling the fdr. consider the set of tests for which the local fdr is below  <dig> , say. this set is not identical to the set identified by the standard criterion that fdr <  <dig> . the local fdr is higher than the q-value. therefore the first set is strictly included in the second one. the local fdr rule is therefore more conservative than the usual fdr one.

CONCLUSIONS
the p-value gives the probability that a non differentially expressed gene would be as or more extreme than the gene under concern. the q-value indicates the estimated proportion of genes as or more extreme than the gene under concern that are a false positive. the local fdr gives the estimated proportion of genes around the gene under concern which are false positive. the latter may be used as the probability that the gene under concern is a false positive, taking into account the multiplicity of the test. one of the major interest of the local fdr is that it gives the opportunity to compute the fdr of any given group of clones  or genes pertaining to the same regulatory network or the same chromosome.
