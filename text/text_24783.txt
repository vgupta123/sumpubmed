BACKGROUND
carbonic anhydrases  are zinc metalloenzymes which catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate . this simple interconversion of a membrane-permeable gas substrate into a membrane-impermeable ionic product is vital to many important biological functions; such enzymes are thus widely distributed in nature. on the basis of differences in amino acid sequence and structure, carbonic anhydrases are divided into five distinct, evolutionarily unrelated gene families: α, β, γ and the recently discovered δ and ζ  <cit> . the α-cas are distributed in animals, plants, algae and bacteria. in mammals various α-ca isoforms with different subcellular localization and tissue distribution are implicated in many physiological processes such as carboxylation/decarboxylation reactions, transport of co <dig> and/or hco3-, ph regulation, ion exchange, calcification, metabolism of urea, glucose and lipids, tumorigenicity, bone resorption and many other physiological and pathological processes  <cit> . members of β-cas are predominant in plants, algae, archaea and bacteria. in photosynthetic organisms β-cas play an important role in transport and autotrophic fixation of co <dig> while in prokaryotes β-cas are involved in wide range of cellular functions including provision of hco3- for carboxylating enzymes which catalyze key steps in biosynthetic pathways for essential metabolites, such as amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids  <cit> .

the γ-cas are predominant in bacteria and archaea domains. in eukaryotes, they have so far been described only in photosynthetic organisms. while the physiological role of α-cas in mammals and β-cas in plants and prokaryotes, have been extensively studied, the role of γ-cas remain elusive. to date, the only γ-ca that has been extensively characterized is "cam" from the methanogenic archaeon methanosarcina thermophila  <cit> . in the cyanobacterium synechocystis, the bifunctional ccmm protein localized in carboxysome  shows an n-terminal γ-ca like domain which has been proposed to bind hco3-/co <dig>  <cit> . however, no carbonic anhydrase activity could be detected for the recombinant ccmm expressed in e. coli. recently, a similar role for binding and transporting bicarbonate has been proposed for γ-ca subunits of plant mitochondrial complex, suggesting that the so-called γ-cas in photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms do not act as carbonic anhydrases but may have related activity contributing to co <dig> recycling in photorespiration, or play a role in the carbon transport between mitochondria and chloroplasts to increase the efficiency of photosynthetic co <dig> fixation  <cit> .

unraveling of microbial genome sequences has shown that γ-cas are widespread in prokaryotes, and it is likely that these enzymes play diverse roles in microorganisms. investigations into the ways in which archaea and bacteria domains use γ-carbonic anhydrase may reveal novel aspects of prokaryotic physiology. we are analyzing the role of carbonic anhydrases in a nonphotosynthetic, gram-negative, plant growth promoting α-proteobacterium, azospirillum brasilense that lives in close association with the roots of several important crop plants and grasses and stimulates the growth of its host plant by producing phytohormones and siderophores  <cit> . earlier, we have cloned the gene encoding β-ca from a. brasilense, overexpresed, purified and characterized β-ca. we also showed that the transcription of bca gene was down regulated by stationary phase, elevated co <dig> and acidic ph  <cit> . the objective of this study was to study the role of a putative gene encoding γ-carbonic anhydrase in a. brasilense sp <dig> 

RESULTS
sequence and phylogenetic analysis of gca <dig> of a. brasilense
a search for the presence of orfs annotated as carbonic anhydrase in the genome of a. brasilense sp <dig> http://genome.ornl.gov/microbial/abra/ revealed three orfs out of which two were annotated to encode carbonic anhydrase/acetyltransferase. blast results of the amino acid sequences of these two orfs showed homology with putative γ-cas. using the sequence information from a. brasilense sp <dig> genome, one of the putative γ-ca orf  of a. brasilense sp <dig> was pcr amplified, and sequenced. the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the a. brasilense sp <dig> gca <dig> and the putative γ-ca of a. brasilense sp <dig> were 97% and 99% identical, respectively. the gca <dig> orf consisted of  <dig> bp, which can translate a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig> kda. blastp analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of a. brasilense gca <dig> revealed 27% identity with cam, a γ-ca from m. thermophila. in addition to its homology with putative γ-cas, gca <dig> also showed significant homology to proteins annotated as acetyltransferase/isoleucine patch superfamily with no predicted function .

as inferred from x-ray crystallographic studies of cam, the active-site zinc is coordinated by three histidine residues  <cit> . the alignment of gca <dig> with the cam sequence showed that the essential histidines  required for ligating the active site zn are absolutely conserved in gca <dig>  further analysis revealed that three other residues  present in all γ-class ca sequences and reported to be involved in biochemical activity of cam of m. thermophila, are also conserved in gca <dig> . two glutamate residues, glu- <dig> and glu- <dig> of cam, whose role has been shown in co <dig> hydration and proton transfer, respectively, are conserved in cyanobacterial ccmm sequence but neither in gca <dig> nor in other γ-ca homologues such as pseudomonas putida  and e. coli  which share 36%, and 32% identity, respectively, with gca <dig>  suggesting that alternative residues might serve these roles.

to examine the phylogenetic relationship of a. brasilense gca <dig> with other known orthologs, the amino acid sequences of different γ-cas from eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria, bacteria and archaea were used to generate multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree . the deduced γ-ca amino acid sequences clustered in two clades; the larger clade a consisted of sequences from all three domains of life. the catalytically important residues of cam, glu- <dig> and glu- <dig> were missing in these sequences and information regarding ca activity of protein encoded by any of these sequences is lacking. clade b consisted of well documented cam protein from m. thermophila and cyanobacterial ccmm proteins. although cam has been shown to biochemically function as ca and its physiological role during acetotrophic growth has been suggested, no ca activity for ccmm, the closest relative of this ca in the phylogeny has been reported.

phylogenetic analysis suggests that γ-class is largely populated with homologs of a subclass that lack proton shuttle residues essential for cam, and the deduced gca <dig> sequence of a. brasilense falls in this subclass along with orthologs from closely related members of α- proteobacteria, viz. magnetospirillum magneticum, rhodospirillum rubrum, rhodospirillum centenum and granulibacter bethesdensis.

analysis of gca <dig> gene transcript in minimal and rich medium
before extending the study on functional analysis of gca <dig> in a. brasilense, the expression of gca <dig> gene in a. brasilense cells was examined. cell extracts of a. brasilense showed very low level of carbonic anhydrase activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/mg. since a. brasilense genome also encodes a functional β-ca  <cit> , it was not clear if the observed ca activity was due to β-ca or also due to γ-ca. to determine whether gca <dig> is expressed in a. brasilense under ambient conditions, rt-pcr with rna samples isolated from the mid-log phase cultures grown in minimal  or rich  medium was performed. the ~ <dig> bp gca <dig> transcripts was produced from both the rna samples  which was confirmed by sequencing the cdna amplicons. these results indicated that a. brasilense gca <dig> is constitutively expressed in cells grown in minimal or rich medium under ambient atmospheric conditions.

characterization of protein encoded by gca1
to examine whether gca <dig> gene encoded a functionally active protein, the gca <dig> orf was amplified from the a. brasilense sp <dig> genomic dna and directionally cloned into the pet15b to construct an over-expression plasmid, psk <dig> which, after confirmation by sequencing, was used for expression in e. coli and purification of the recombinant protein. sds-page analysis of extracts from uninduced versus induced cultures showed the presence of a protein of the expected size in the induced cells . the size of the recombinant gca <dig>  was larger than the predicted polypeptide size  due to the additional vector-encoded his-tag at the n-terminus of the protein. the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity under denaturing conditions . a clear band of purified protein in the position corresponding to the overexpressed protein in the crude lysate was visualized on the gel . this band cross-reacted with anti-cam antiserum . the recognition of recombinant gca <dig> with heterologous antibody indicates significant similarity between gca <dig> and cam.

no ca activity could be detected in crude cell extracts of e. coli overexpressing recombinant gca <dig> while under the same ca activity assay conditions, α-bovine caii showed specific ca activity of about  <dig> wau/mg, respectively. these results indicate that the supernatant fractions containing soluble recombinant gca <dig> lacked detectable co <dig> hydration activity.

construction of gca <dig> knockout  mutant
in order to gain an insight into the possible physiological role of gca <dig> in a. brasilense, attempt was made to construct a Δgca <dig> of a. brasilense sp <dig> by inserting kanamycin resistance gene cassette into the coding region of gca <dig> but in spite of repeated attempts no gca <dig> mutant could be isolated. since deletion of ca gene generally results in high co <dig> requiring  phenotype  <cit> , attempts were also made to isolate the desired mutants at 3% co <dig> concentration . the inability to obtain γ-ca knock-out mutant under aerobic atmosphere as well as under the atmosphere containing 3% co <dig> probably reflects that this putative γ-ca might be essential for the survival and growth of a. brasilense in the atmosphere containing ambient to 3% levels of co <dig>  since bicarbonate is a substrate for carboxylating enzymes central to many metabolic processes  <cit> , attempts were also made to restore Δgca <dig> by supplementing the minimal medium with some metabolic intermediates . unfortunately, none of these supplements rescued Δgca <dig> of a. brasilense suggesting that the putative gca <dig> protein might have physiological implications other than hydration of co <dig> 

bioinformatic analysis of gca <dig> organization: prediction of argc-gca <dig> operon in a. brasilense
while analyzing the organization of gca <dig> chromosomal region of a. brasilense using genome database and ncbi database blast resources, a putative gene  was identified that was located upstream of gca <dig> orf in the same transcriptional orientation with an intergenic distance of  <dig> nucleotides . the argc gene product  of a. brasilense shared high similarity with the argc protein of r. centenum, m. magneticum and r. rubrum. the n-acetyl-gamma-glutamate-phosphate reductase  encoded by argc is involved in the arginine biosynthesis in prokaryotes  <cit> . the arginine biosynthetic pathway proceeds via n-acetylation of l-glutamate by n-acetylglutamate synthase  yielding n-acetylglutamate which is converted into n-acetylglutamyl-phosphate by n-acetylglutamate 5-phosphotransferase encoded by argb. n-acetylglutamyl-phosphate is subsequently reduced to n-acetylglutamic semialdehyde by n-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase, encoded by the argc gene. thus the argc protein catalyses the third step in the pathway of biosynthesis of arginine from glutamate  <cit> .

several studies have shown that short intergenic distance between orfs and phylogenetically conserved gene order are important generalized predictor of operon structure  <cit> . thus, conservation of this adjacent, co-directional gene-pair might link apparently unrelated argc and gca <dig> genes in a co-transcriptional relationship. in order to test this possibility, the chromosomal neighbourhoods of gca <dig> orthologs in sequenced bacterial genomes of the members of phylogenetic tree  including both distant and close relatives of a. brasilense were analyzed. interestingly, this gene order was found to be fairly well conserved in some of the sequenced members of rhodobacteriaceae such as m. magneticum, r. rubrum and r. centenum . a similar syntenic organization was also observed in a member of acetobacteriaceae , but not in other bacterial genomes in which gca <dig> homologs are found. examination of the intergenic distance between argc and γ-ca encoding genes revealed a distance of only  <dig> nt in m. magneticum and g. bethesdensis,  <dig> nt in a. brasilense and  <dig> nt in r. rubrum whereas in r. centenum a gene encoding a protein of unknown function present between these two genes. thus, a conserved gene order of argc-gca <dig> and relatively short intergenic distance in a. brasilense and phylogenetically close members suggested that these two adjacent codirectional genes might comprise a bicistronic operon and also the possibility of functional and/or regulatory relationship between the two genes. the synteny with regard to the two other orfs encoding  <dig> s and  <dig> s ribosomal subunit proteins, respectively, located upstream of the argc gene was observed in a. brasilense as well as in g. bethesdensis and r. centenum but not in other closely related bacteria.

confirmation of the transcriptional linkage of the argc-gca <dig> orfs
to determine if argc and gca <dig> genes are part of a single operon and transcribed as a single mrna, reverse transcription-pcr  experiments were performed using total rna isolated from a. brasilense cultures using three different primer sets,  gcaf1/gcar <dig> to amplify gca <dig> orf , argf/argr <dig> for  <dig> bp portion of argc orf and argf1/gcar <dig> to amplify the transcript  encompassing both argc and gca <dig> orfs. analysis of rt-pcr amplified product revealed that argf1/gcar <dig> primer set produced a fragment of expected size  indicating that there was a single mrna for these two genes. amplicons of expected size, ca  <dig> bp and ca  <dig> bp, were also obtained with argc and gca1-specific primer sets, respectively . rt-pcr analysis confirmed that these genes are, in fact, co-transcribed which suggests a new functional linkage between the two genes that may have interesting implications for a. brasilense physiology.

determination of transcription start site of argc-gca <dig> transcript
co-transcription of argc-gca <dig>  confirmed by rt-pcr, prompted us to determine the transcription start site  and promoter elements involved in the regulation of this operon. we were also interested to examine if gca <dig> has its own tss which could be used to regulate transcription of only gca <dig> from a promoter located upstream of gca <dig> somewhere in argc orf. for this purpose, we performed 5'race experiment using rna sample isolated from a. brasilense sp <dig>  in the first step of 5'race experiment, we used gcar <dig> for cdna synthesis as this primer could drive the synthesis of cdnas from both types of transcripts , if present. in the later reactions, the respective nested primers were used  to amplify regions upstream of argc and gca <dig>  amplicons obtained in both cases, with gca <dig> and argc specific nested primers, showed a single transcription start from a c residue located at position - <dig> relative to the predicted translational start site of argc  indicating the presence of only one tss for this predicted operon located upstream of argc orf. analysis of the region upstream the identified tss for corresponding promoter elements  indicated the presence of ctaccg at - <dig> and gtacaa at - <dig> of tss with a spacing of  <dig> nt. eight base pairs upstream from the atg initiation codon, a consensus aaggaa shine-dalgarno sequence for ribosome binding was found .

inducibility of argc-gca <dig> operon in response to stationary phase and high co2
after the confirmation of co-transcription by rt-pcr and determination of transcription start site by 5'race experiment which suggested the transcription of argc and gca <dig> genes from a promoter located upstream of argc orf, we examined the regulation of argc-gca <dig> operon in response to different conditions. for this purpose, -  <dig> to +  <dig> of tss of argc-gca <dig> was inserted upstream of the promoterless lacz reporter in prkk <dig> to make transcriptional fusion , and β-galactosidase assay was performed with cells of a. brasilense harboring psk <dig> and grown in mmab in different conditions.

comparison of β-galactosidase activity in the cells taken from exponential and stationary phase cultures  showed that pargc activity was significantly up-regulated  during stationary phase than in the exponential phase of growth. similarly, β-galactosidase activity measured in exponentially growing cells of a. brasilense harboring psk <dig> under 3% co <dig> enriched atmosphere was ~ <dig> fold higher than the cells grown in ambient atmosphere . these data suggested that the pargc is constitutively but weakly expressed in exponentially growing cells under optimal growth conditions but significantly induced in response to high co <dig> or stationary phase.

in order to further confirm whether gca <dig> has its own promoter, an additional construct  was made by inserting - <dig> to -  <dig> of predicted translational start of gca <dig> in the same vector . no β-galactosidase activity could be detected with cells of a. brasilense strains harboring psk <dig> under any of the above conditions  indicating that there is no promoter upstream of gca <dig>  this result further confirmed the previously noted single tss by 5'race experiment for argc-gca <dig> operon and no independent transcription start site for gca <dig>  thus the results obtained from 5'race experiment and promoter analysis is in agreement with the notion that transcription of argc-gca <dig> operon is regulated by a single promoter located upstream of argc.

as argc is involved in arginine biosynthesis in prokaryotes, and arginine biosynthetic genes are normally induced in response to arginine limitation as might be the case in stationary phase when arginine becomes limiting  <cit> . to ascertain if the induction of pargc in stationary phase is a consequence of arginine limitation, promoter activity assay was performed with the cells harbouring psk <dig> taken from exponential phase and stationary phase cultures grown in minimal media supplemented with l-arginine . no difference was found in the β-galactosidase activity in cultures lacking/supplemented with exogenous arginine . as supplementation with exogenous arginine did not affect the activity of pargc in either exponential or stationary phase, it is likely that regulation of expression of argc-gca <dig> operon is arginine independent.

discussion
availability of bacterial genome sequences has opened a new range of possibilities to elucidate the functions of these sequences, thus providing biochemical, physiological, evolutionary, and ecological meaning to the nucleotide sequence data. release of partial genome sequence of a. brasilense has allowed the characterization of different genes that might be involved in the physiology of this plant growth promoting bacterium. a. brasilense genome revealed the presence of one β-ca and two putative γ-ca encoding genes. recently, we have shown that β-ca gene in a. brasilense encoded a functionally active protein, and its expression was regulated by growth phase, co <dig> concentration and ph  <cit> . in this work, one of the putative orfs whose amino acid sequence shared significant identity with other members of the γ-ca family was characterized.

the cell-free extracts having overexpressed recombinant gca <dig> protein did not show ca activity under the conditions tested. similar lack of detectable ca activity as found in case of recombinant gca <dig> protein was also observed in recombinant γ-ca of arabidopsis  <cit> , two cyanobacterial ccmm orthologs  <cit> , e. coli proteins yrda, caie, and paay  <cit> , γ-ca-like proteins from c. glutamicum  <cit>  and c. reinhardii  <cit> . it is interesting to note that since the discovery of ca activity in cam in  <dig>  all reported tests for ca activity in cam homologs have proven negative although structural modelling and sequence analyses showed homology with the overall fold of cam and conservation of the residues essential for metal binding and catalysis, except glu- <dig> and glu- <dig>  also, antibodies directed against cam specifically recognized gca <dig>  and mitochondrial γ-cas  <cit> .

as no Δgca <dig> mutant could be isolated under the tested conditions, the functional role of gca <dig> was analyzed by examining its neighboring genes. conservation of the gene order in prokaryotes has been considered as one of the important predictors of gene function that helps in speculating the function of a gene based on its neighborhood or gene organization  <cit> . the inspection of the genome sequences of other bacteria revealed that the gca <dig> homologues found in bacteria phylogenetically close to a. brasilense had a striking synteny for gca locus. on the basis of short intergenic distance and phylogenetically conserved organization of argc-gca <dig>  an operon-like organization of the two genes, argc and gca <dig> in a. brasilense was predicted. rt-pcr analysis revealed a transcript encompassing argc and gca <dig> genes confirming that argc-gca <dig> genes were co-transcribed in a. brasilense. in addition, 5'race experiment confirmed a single transcription start site located upstream of argc, and a lack of independent tss for gca <dig>  one of the major advantages of operon prediction in relatively less investigated organisms is that in many cases we may be able to link hypothetical genes to more-well-characterized loci and thus gain some insight into the possible function and regulation of the uncharacterized gene.

as γ-cas of plant mitochondrial complex have recently been proposed to be involved in binding/transporting co2/bicarbonate  <cit> , it is intriguing to note that the putative γ-cas of α- and γ-proteobacteria  may also be inactive with respect to ca activity and only bind co <dig> and/or bicarbonate in the context of different physiological processes. in the present case, on the basis of the induction of argc-gca <dig> promoter activity in response to high co <dig>  and lack of detectable ca activity of gca <dig>  it can be speculated that gca <dig>  like mitochondrial γ-ca, might also be involved in binding of co2/hco3- to provide the substrates to different metabolic enzymes, and may not act as carbonic anhydrase.

the amino acid sequence of γ-cas also showed significant similarity with proteins belonging to hexapeptide repeat family composed mainly of acetyl transferases  <cit>  and since the biosynthesis of arginine from glutamate proceeds through several n-acetylated intermediates  <cit> , it is possible that gca <dig> might be involved in the acetylation of some intermediate/s in the arginine biosynthetic pathway.

promoter activity data also indicate that the regulation of argc-gca <dig> promoter is not affected by exogenous arginine. the lack of repression of the a. brasilense argc-gca <dig> genes by arginine is consistent with the data reported on the activities of arginine biosynthetic enzymes in various bacteria and cyanobacteria that exhibit a cyclic pathway of ornithine synthesis, where the regulatory mechanism appears to rely mostly on feedback inhibition by arginine of the second enzyme, n-acetylglutamate phosphotransferase  <cit> . under nutrient-limiting conditions during stationary phase, arginine is an important metabolite as it can act both as a carbon and nitrogen source. arginine is also a precursor for the synthesis of polyamines, putrescine and spermidine, which may reduce oxidative damage to proteins and dna. since in e. coli, arginine constitutes 11% of the cell's nitrogen in stationary phase, biosynthesis of this amino acid is thought to be important under sub-optimal conditions  <cit> . this is the first report showing the role of co <dig> in the regulation of argc expression in any bacteria. although the precise role of argc in arginine biosynthesis in a. brasilense is not yet established, it is likely that the high metabolic co <dig> generated during stationary phase up-regulates arginine biosynthetic genes, including argc-gca <dig> operon alleviating arginine limitation in the nutrient starved stationary phase cells. the induction of argc-gca <dig> operon during stationary phase and at high co <dig> observed in this study suggests a possible regulatory link between arginine metabolism and another not yet characterized carbon dioxide-dependent process in which gca <dig> like protein might have a role to play.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows lack of co <dig> hydration activity in the recombinant γ-ca-like protein from a. brasilense. the unique operonic organization of gca <dig> and argc, observed in a. brasilense is syntenous with some of its closely related α-proteobacteria, viz. magnetospirillum, rhodospirillum, granulibacter etc. this suggests that the γ-ca-like gene cotranscribed with argc gene in a. brasilense, instead of being involved in co <dig> hydration, may have a role in arginine biosynthesis.
