BACKGROUND
the matrix metalloproteinases  are a family of some  <dig> zinc dependent proteases that, collectively, possess the ability to degrade nearly every component of the extra-cellular matrix  <cit> . the activity of the mmps is tightly controlled through proteolytic activation of the zymogen forms and stoichiometric binding of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases . the mmps play an important role in many physiological processes due to their inherent ability to remodel tissues  <cit> . however, in disease states such as vascular disease and stroke, the mmps may become deleterious due to dysregulation and can result in tissue injury and inflammation. specifically, the mmps may be involved in the degradation of the basal lamina in reperfusion injury resulting in disruption of the blood brain barrier and hemorrhagic transformation  <cit> .

recently, several lines of evidence have demonstrated the involvement of the mmps in cerebral ischemia. studies in rat, mouse, and baboon models have shown that mmp- <dig> is up-regulated following transient focal ischemia  <cit> . additionally, asahi et al. have shown that mmp- <dig> knockout as well as mmp- <dig> inhibition reduces ischemic lesion volume  <cit> . however, others have shown that pharmacological inhibition of mmp- <dig> yields no change  <cit> . lapchak et al. demonstrated that broad-spectrum mmp inhibition  reduced the incidence of hemorrhage in tpa treated brains when administered shortly after the onset of ischemia  <cit> . in addition, sumii et al. were able to show a reduction in hemorrhage severity in tpa treated animals given the same mmp inhibitor bb- <dig>  <cit> .

clearly the mmps are involved in the pathology of cerebral ischemia and hemorrhagic transformation. however, there is still uncertainty as to the origin of mmp activity. immunohistochemical studies from asahi et al. demonstrated that mmp- <dig> is primarily up-regulated in the vascular spaces while others have shown that there is a concomitant staining of neutrophils in the areas of mmp- <dig> activation suggesting a role for the neutrophil in the up-regulation of mmp- <dig>  <cit> . indeed, a recent study has shown that prevention of neutrophil infiltration significantly reduces mmp- <dig> up-regulation in an occlusion/reperfusion model of ischemia  <cit> . the source of mmp activity in focal cerebral ischemia is important to the development of therapies to target this mediator of neurovascular injury. it is still unknown whether neutrophils are an important source of mmps in experimental hemorrhagic transformation.

the objective of the current study was to evaluate the role of the neutrophil in hemorrhagic transformation and edema formation in a hyperacute 3-hour occlusion/reperfusion model of focal ischemia. the central hypothesis was that depletion of neutrophils would reduce hemorrhage development due to prevention of the up-regulation of mmp- <dig> 

RESULTS
neutrophil depletion
control and neutrophil-depletion groups received normal rabbit serum and anti-pmn antibody, respectively,  <dig> hours prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion  surgery. the dose of the anti-neutrophil antibody chosen  was very effective in reducing the circulating neutrophils. in control animals that received normal serum, neutrophil count, expressed as mean ± se of percent of total leukocyte count, was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and as expected did not differ from baseline. in the depletion group, administration of anti-pmn antibody reduced the neutrophil count to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % from  <dig> % at baseline . all animals included in the neutropenic group had >90% depletion of their neutrophils prior to the stroke surgery, as assessed by a blinded investigator using a hemocytometer . the body weight of control animals was  <dig> ±  <dig> g at baseline,  <dig> ±  <dig> g prior to stroke and  <dig> ±  <dig> g at  <dig> hours. in the antibody-treated group, body weight was  <dig> ±  <dig> g at baseline,  <dig> ±  <dig> prior to stroke surgery, and  <dig> ±  <dig> g at  <dig> hours.

gelatinase quantification
ischemia for three hours followed by  <dig> h reperfusion resulted in a significant increase in the expression and activity of both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> in the ipsilateral hemispheres . quantitative analysis of the gelatin zymography revealed consistent increases in the lower molecular weight form of mmp- <dig> . although there was a faint band corresponding to  <dig> kda mmp, the gelatinolytic activity in control vs neutrophil-depleted animals was similar. protein levels of mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>  were significantly increased in the ischemic hemisphere and neutrophil depletion did not affect mmp protein levels.

infarct size, edema and hemorrhage assessment
there was no significant effect of neutrophil depletion on either infarct size or the development of hemorrhagic transformation in our model . in addition, cerebral edema formation was similar between untreated and neutrophil-depleted animals. neurologic examination at  <dig> hours was not significantly different between the two treatment groups .

discussion
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion are known to induce large increases in mmp- <dig> protein and activity in the affected hemisphere and mmp- <dig> has been associated with hemorrhage formation in humans  <cit>  and experimental animals  <cit> . experimental inhibition of the mmps has been associated with decreased hemorrhage formation and improved stroke outcome  <cit> . since neutrophils are a known source of mmp- <dig>  this study was designed to determine whether neutrophil depletion, prior to cerebral artery occlusion, would decrease mmp expression and reduce hemorrhagic transformation.

despite the fact that neutrophil depletion was essentially complete prior to the focal cerebral ischemia in our experiment, we detected an increase in gelatinolytic activity corresponding to 86– <dig> kda mmp- <dig>  there was a faint band for the  <dig> kda prommp- <dig>  and the activity did not differ between the ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres. immunoblotting experiments confirmed the results of gelatin zymography and showed that specific up-regulation of the mmp- <dig> protein is responsible for increased gelatinolytic activity. justicia et al. reported that, in a  <dig> h mcao model in which the neutrophil depletion or antagonism was achieved by vinblastine administration or neutralizing antibodies against vcam- <dig>  respectively, there was no effect on the  <dig> kda mmp- <dig> expression but, increases in  <dig> kda mmp- <dig> activity were prevented. our results are in agreement with this observation that neutrophils are not the source of  <dig> kda mmp- <dig>  however, we do not detect any increase in  <dig> kda mmp- <dig>  this difference may be due to the duration of ischemia  and the extent of ischemic damage  <cit> . we have previously shown that hemorrhagic transformation occurs in various different regions of the injured hemisphere including: preoptic area, striatum and the lateral cortex in this model and that development of hemorrhagic transformation is related to the duration of occlusion, with no hemorrhage when reperfusion occurs after only  <dig> hour  <cit> .

in this model of focal cerebral ischemia and hemorrhagic transformation, where the mca was occluded for  <dig> hours prior to reperfusion, no significant effect of neutrophil depletion could be shown on either neurovascular damage or neurologic function. also, from our results, it is clear that neutrophils are not an important contribution to the increased mmp- <dig> expression in the  <dig> hours after this injury. it is possible that the contributions of neutrophils are greater when the injury to the brain is less profound than in our model. several different investigators have demonstrated that preventing the adhesion of neutrophils  <cit>  after ischemia and reperfusion reduces the ultimate injury. maier et al. reported that in superoxide dismutase  knock-out animals that are more susceptible to ischemic damage, neutrophils are not the source of mmp- <dig> contributing to blood brain barrier breakdown providing further support for the results of this present study  <cit> .

activated neutrophils release free radicals and proteolytic enzymes such as mmp- <dig> , in addition to activating cytokines, which further the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury. we initially thought that neutrophil adherence and activation may be an early contributor to the development of microvascular injury and hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral ischemia but this turned out to be not the case  <cit> . it is still possible that neutrophils are involved in the destruction of the basal lamina, but it is likely to occur later in the process, after neutrophil recruitment is maximal.

CONCLUSIONS
although neutrophils have been shown to contain mmp- <dig>  release of mmp- <dig> by neutrophils is probably not the mechanism of the early microvascular damage leading to edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation in our model. in addition, neutrophil adhesion is not necessary for the increase in activation of mmp- <dig> after ischemia. although neutrophils may contribute to the ultimate degree of neurologic damage after ischemia and reperfusion in the brain, they are not necessary for the development of hemorrhagic transformation.
