BACKGROUND
amphibian metamorphosis is generally characterized by dramatic and conspicuous developmental changes that are necessary for larvae to function as terrestrial adults. the morphological, behavioral, and physiological changes that occur during metamorphosis are associated with increases in thyroid hormone   <cit>  and rna synthesis  <cit> . these events are interconnected; at metamorphosis, tissue-specific concentrations of th activate and repress transcriptional networks within target cells that in turn regulate new patterns of development  <cit> . many genes that are associated with molecular and morphological events during metamorphosis have been identified from studies of anurans, and in particular xenopus laevis. in contrast, little is known about patterns of gene expression during salamander metamorphosis.

although anuran and salamander metamorphosis are regulated by many of the same endocrine factors, there is considerable developmental variation between these groups. most conspicuously, some salamanders do not undergo a complete metamorphosis in nature. these salamanders are called paedomorphs because they retain larval characteristics into the adult stage, and because genetic and phylogenetic evidence suggests that they evolve from metamorphic ancestors  <cit> . paedomorphosis in the mexican axolotl  is associated with low hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  activity and differential sensitivity of tissues to th that results in some cryptic biochemical and molecular changes, but not the complete suite of morphological changes seen in related, metamorphic tiger salamanders. interestingly, a. mexicanum can be induced to undergo anatomical metamorphosis by administering th and endocrine factors that function upstream of th synthesis  <cit> . the axolotl provides an excellent alternative to anuran systems because metamorphosis can be precisely induced and studied in juveniles or adults that are not developing toward a metamorphic outcome.

functional genomic approaches are beginning to reshape the way transcription is conceptualized during amphibian metamorphosis  <cit> . the transcriptional program for tissue regression, remodeling, and organogenesis is significantly more complicated than was initially predicted for xenopus  <cit> . previously, we used microarray technology to identify keratin biomarkers for t <dig> induced metamorphosis in the integument  of the mexican axolotl  <cit> . we showed that  <dig> nm t <dig> induces a complex transcriptional program and axolotls complete metamorphosis with no mortality. interestingly, this t <dig> concentration is known to affect gene expression and mortality in anurans  <cit>  and it is higher than t <dig> concentrations estimated in the serum of spontaneously metamorphosing salamanders. for example, larras-regard et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> nm as the maximum serum t <dig> level in ambystoma tigrinum, a close relative of the axolotl that typically undergoes metamorphosis. to further investigate the effect of t <dig> concentration on induced metamorphosis in the mexican axolotl, we report the results of a second microarray experiment that induced metamorphosis using a much lower concentration of t <dig> . using  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> microarray datasets, we describe the temporal transcriptional response of t <dig> induced metamorphosis and specifically address the following question: does t <dig> concentration affect morphological metamorphosis and gene expression in the axolotl? we discuss the biological significance of some of the differentially expressed genes  that were identified and the relationship between salamander and anuran metamorphic gene expression programs.

RESULTS
effect of t <dig> concentration on morphological metamorphosis
during t <dig> induced metamorphosis, mexican axolotls progress through developmental stages   <cit>  that are defined by the resorption of the upper and lower tailfins, dorsal ridge, and gills. we staged all axolotls after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days of t <dig> treatment. no metamorphic changes were observed after two days of t <dig> treatment and thus axolotls from both t <dig> treatments were assigned to stage  <dig>  at day  <dig>  morphological changes were observed in  <dig> nm t <dig> treated axolotls  but  <dig> nm t <dig> treated axolotls were indistinguishable from control animals . at day  <dig>  axolotls reared in  <dig> nm t <dig> had fully resorbed tailfins and gills, and thus had completed morphological metamorphosis . between days  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> nm t <dig> treated axolotls initiated metamorphosis but did not complete all morphological changes by day  <dig> . on average, individuals complete metamorphosis after  <dig> days in  <dig> nm t <dig> . thus, a low concentration of t <dig> delays the initiation timing of morphological metamorphosis but not the length of the metamorphic period.

gene expression in the absence of t4
our first set of statistical analyses tested control axolotls for temporal changes in mrna abundance that were independent of t <dig> treatment . temporal changes are expected if patterns of transcription  change significantly over time as salamanders mature, or if there are uncontrolled sources of experimental variation. after adjusting the false discovery rate  to  <dig> , none of the probe-sets  on the custom ambystoma genechip were identified as significantly differentially abundant as a function of time. thus, we found no statistical support for differential gene expression among control animals.

gene expression in the presence of t4:  <dig> versus  <dig> nm
at each of the times that we estimated mrna abundances during t <dig> induced metamorphosis, the number and diversity of genes that were differentially expressed between the  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> treatments differed  . a total of  <dig> degs that differed by ≥ two-fold at one or more of our sampling times were identified among all day by t <dig> treatment contrasts  . we identified  <dig> degs as early as day  <dig> , and eighty percent of these degs were up regulated in  <dig> nm t <dig> relative to  <dig> nm t <dig>  this small group of early response genes was statistically associated with the amino acid transport and amine transport ontology terms. additional gene functions of these early responding genes include epithelial differentiation, ion transport, rna processing, signal transduction, and apoptosis/growth arrest. we note that no differentially expressed transcription factors were identified as degs at day  <dig>  and neither thyroid hormone receptor  was identified as differentially expressed at any time point in our study. at day  <dig>  when axolotls in  <dig> nm t <dig> were undergoing dramatic tissue resorption events and axolotls in  <dig> nm t <dig> were indistinguishable from controls, we identified the greatest number of degs between the t <dig> treatments . an approximately equivalent number of up and down regulated degs were identified . these genes were enriched for functions associated with epidermis development, carbohydrate metabolism, ectoderm development, response to chemical stimulus, negative regulation of cell proliferation, response to abiotic stimulus, negative regulation of biological process, development, and organ development. by day  <dig>  when axolotls in  <dig> nm t <dig> had completed metamorphosis and axolotls in  <dig> nm t <dig> were continuing to show morphological restructuring, we identified  <dig> degs that differed between the t <dig> treatments . of the identified degs, 76% were down regulated in  <dig> nm t <dig> relative to  <dig> nm t <dig> . degs identified at day  <dig> were associated with response to pest, pathogen, or parasite, negative regulation of cellular process, positive regulation of physiological process, response to stress, response to stimulus, transition metal ion transport, di-, tri-valent inorganic cation transport, response to other organism, immune response, development, organismal physiological process, muscle contraction, response to biotic stimulus, and response to bacteria. the functional categories that we identified show that the axolotl epidermal transcriptional response to t <dig> is complex, involving hundreds of degs.

n/a refers to genes that do not have established orthologies to human. probe-set id represents the unique identifier for each probe-set on the custom ambystoma genechip. contig id represents the sal-site  <cit>  identifier for contigs associated with each probe-set. all fold changes are relative to the  <dig> nm dataset. thus positive values are up regulated in  <dig> nm samples relative to  <dig> nm samples and negative values are down regulated in  <dig> nm samples relative to  <dig> nm samples.

to further explore the effect of t <dig> on gene expression and morphological metamorphosis we conducted a principal component analysis . this analysis shows that global gene expression and morphological metamorphosis are strongly correlated, but there is little or no correlation between gene expression and t <dig> treatment . this suggests that after metamorphosis was initiated within t <dig> treatments, molecular and morphological events were coordinately regulated. t <dig> concentration affected the onset timing of metamorphosis in axolotls, but not the sequence of transcriptional and morphological events that define this process.

modeling the transcriptional response of genes during induced metamorphosis
to further investigate the effect of t <dig> concentration on induced metamorphosis, we modeled mrna abundance estimates from the  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> treatments using quadratic and linear regression. the regression analyses identified  <dig> and  <dig> degs that changed by ≥ two-fold relative to day  <dig> controls, in the  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> treatments respectively . given our previous analyses, we expected to observe different regression patterns  for degs from each treatment because metamorphic initiation timing was delayed in  <dig> nm t <dig> and metamorphosis was only completed in  <dig> nm t <dig>  indeed, most degs identified by the  <dig> nm regression analysis exhibited linear expression profiles during metamorphosis  while the majority of the degs identified by the  <dig> nm regression analysis exhibited curvilinear and parabolic expression profiles . thus, biological processes known to be fundamental to tissue remodeling and/or development were identified from both t <dig> treatments, however they were statistically associated with different regression patterns . for example, four collagen-degrading matrix metallopeptidase  genes  exhibited linear up regulated responses in  <dig> nm t <dig> and were categorized as lu. however, under  <dig> nm t <dig>  these genes were categorized among the qc and qlcu profiles. several genes associated with organ development  were up regulated in a linear fashion in  <dig> nm t <dig> and were categorized as lu. in  <dig> nm t <dig>  several of these genes  were statistically significantly up regulated  but failed to eclipse our two-fold change criteria. a single gene  was not statistically significant and categorized as "flat" in  <dig> nm t <dig>  however, this gene did not appreciably deviate from base-line expression levels until day  <dig> in  <dig> nm t <dig> . we attribute these differences between the t4treatments to the delayed onset timing of metamorphosis in the  <dig> nm t <dig> treatment. overall, the same generalized direction of expression was observed for  <dig> of  <dig>  degs that were commonly identified from both t <dig> treatments . the six genes  that seemingly exhibited opposite directions of expression in  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> were all categorized the same way . closer inspection of these expression profiles revealed that genes classified as qlcd trend upward at the early time points before decreasing at later time points . these results show that t <dig> concentration affected the shape of temporal gene expression profiles but essentially all epidermal degs that were identified in both t <dig> treatments were regulated in the same direction by  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> 

the regression analyses identified a number of degs that only met both of our criteria  in one of the t <dig> concentrations . of the  <dig> genes unique to  <dig> nm t <dig>   <dig>  were statistically significant in  <dig> nm t <dig> but did not eclipse our two-fold change criteria. of the remaining  <dig> genes unique to  <dig> nm t <dig>   <dig> exhibited ≥ two-fold change in  <dig> nm t <dig> at one or more sampling times but were not statistically significant. inspection of the  <dig> nm t <dig> regression patterns and fold change data associated with the  <dig> genes unique to  <dig> nm t <dig> revealed that all of these genes exhibited similar directional trends  in  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> . of the  <dig> genes unique to  <dig> nm t <dig>   <dig>  were statistically significant in  <dig> nm t <dig>  but failed to eclipse our two-fold change criteria. an additional  <dig> genes exhibited ≥ two-fold change for at least one sampling time in  <dig> nm t <dig>  but were not statistically significant. inspection of the  <dig> nm t <dig> regression patterns and fold change data associated with the  <dig> genes unique to  <dig> nm t <dig> demonstrated that  <dig>  of these genes exhibited similar directional trends in  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> . an additional  <dig> genes unique to  <dig> nm t <dig> did not exhibit >  <dig>  fold changes relative to day  <dig> controls until day  <dig> , suggesting that they are expressed during the terminal stages of metamorphosis . presumably, these genes were not detected in  <dig> nm t <dig> because we did not sample latter time points for this concentration. these results reiterate the point that essentially all genes identified by our study were similarly, directionally expressed in the  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> treatments.

to address similarity in terms of magnitude, we compared maximum fold level values for genes that exhibited qlvd and qlcu expression profiles in both t <dig> treatments . we assumed that genes exhibiting these profiles had achieved maximum/minimum mrna levels during the experiment, and thus could be reliably compared between treatments. no statistical differences were observed for fold level values of  <dig> qlvd and qlcu genes between the  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> treatments   <cit> , and the fold level values were highly correlated   <cit> . although this analysis was performed on a small subset of genes, the results suggest that mrna abundances are similar for genes that are differentially expressed in  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> 

n/a refers to genes that do not have established orthologies to human. probe-set id represents the unique identifier for each probe-set on the custom ambystoma genechip. fold change  <dig> nm refers to the maximum fold change observed in the  <dig> nm t <dig> treatment relative to day  <dig> controls. fold change  <dig> nm refers to the maximum fold change observed in the  <dig> nm t <dig> treatment relative to day  <dig> controls. profile refers to the expression profile for each gene obtained from regression analyses on the  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> datasets. qlcu refers to the quadratic linear concave up regression profile and qlvd refers to the quadratic linear convex down regression profile.

bioinformatic comparison: axolotl versus xenopus
salamanders and anurans may express similar genes during amphibian metamorphosis. to test this idea, we compared a list of 'core' up regulated metamorphic genes from xenopus  <cit>  to degs identified from our study of axolotl. of the  <dig> genes that were reported as differentially up regulated by ≥  <dig>  fold in limb, brain, tail, and intestine from metamorphosing xenopus,  <dig>  are represented by at least one of the  <dig> probe-sets analyzed in our study. of these, only two  were identified as statistically significant and differentially expressed by ≥ two-fold in our study . fk <dig> binding protein  <dig> was up regulated in axolotl and xenopus. however, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit was down regulated in axolotl and up regulated in xenopus. thus, < 5% of the 'core' degs that are commonly expressed among xenopus tissues during metamorphosis, were identified as degs in our study using axolotl.

we also conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics comparison between degs from axolotl epidermis and degs from t <dig> induced xenopus intestine  <cit> . gene expression similarities may exist between the xenopus intestine and axolotl epidermis because both organs undergo extensive extracellular remodeling that is associated with apoptosis of larval epithelial cells and the proliferation and differentiation of adult cell types. the presumptive orthologs of  <dig> of the  <dig> non-redundant degs from our study correspond to degs from xenopus intestine . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  exhibited the same direction of differential expression in axolotl epidermis and xenopus intestine. this list includes genes that are known to be associated with metamorphic developmental processes in amphibians. for example, two mmps  that are associated with extra cellular matrix turnover were up regulated in xenopus intestine and axolotl epidermis. however, other genes were regulated in opposite directions. for example, keratin  <dig> and keratin  <dig> were down regulated in axolotl epidermis but up regulated in xenopus intestine. these results show that there are similarities and differences in gene expression between xenopus and axolotls when comparing tissues that undergo similar remodeling processes.

biological, technical, and statistical replication
in order to validate a subset of genes that were identified as degs in our microarray experiment, we conducted a second experiment in which we used quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  to generate expression profiles for five candidate genes . these genes were chosen because they are involved in a variety of biological processes including cytoskeleton organization , cell-cell adhesion , tissue remodeling , and ion transport . in addition, we investigated srv_10216_s_at in order to verify results from a gene with unknown function. results of the regression analyses performed on the q-rt-pcr data are presented in figure  <dig> alongside plots of the analogous microarray data. residuals from the models fit for desmocollin  <dig> and solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> exhibited significant departures from normality . overall, there was very good agreement between the expression profiles obtained from microarray and q-rt-pcr analyses. the fact that the q-rt-pcr results are biologically and technically independent of the microarray data strongly suggests that these patterns are repeatable and unlikely to be experimental or technical artifacts.

n/a refers to a gene that does not have an established orthology with human. probe-set id represents the unique identifier for each probe-set on the custom ambystoma genechip. forward and reverse primers are denoted by the extensions  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

previously, we used stringent statistical criteria  to identify  <dig> annotated genes that exhibited robust responses to  <dig> nm t <dig>  <cit> . in that study, we focused on the potential of several keratin loci to serve as biomarkers of early metamorphic changes that precede changes in gross morphology. in this study, we used less stringent criteria to identify degs and more fully explore temporal gene expression responses when t <dig> concentration is varied. of the  <dig> degs previously identified in the epidermis of metamorphosing axolotls,  <dig> genes were statistically significant and differentially regulated by ≥ two-fold in the  <dig> nm regression analysis. of these,  <dig>  were statistically significant and differentially expressed by ≥ two-fold in the  <dig> nm regression analysis. only one of these  <dig> genes was expressed in opposite directions between the t <dig> treatments . however this gene was classified as lu in  <dig> nm t <dig> and qlcd in  <dig> nm t <dig>  and represents another example of a transiently up regulated gene that was categorized as qlcd . the  <dig> genes identified in  <dig> nm t <dig> but not  <dig> nm t <dig>  may function in late stage metamorphic processes that were only attained within  <dig> days under  <dig> nm t <dig>  for example, keratin  <dig> is known to be a marker of proliferating basal epidermal stem cells in mammals  <cit> ; this gene may be expressed late during metamorphosis in terminal cell populations of axolotl epidermis that give rise to adult epithelial cells. other genes associated with tissue stress, injury, and immune function  also appear to be late response genes although we can't rule out the possibility that these genes may be differentially expressed as a toxic response to  <dig> nm t <dig>  the majority of the degs identified previously using  <dig> nm t <dig> and very strict statistical criteria were similarly identified using  <dig> nm t <dig> and different statistical methods/criteria. these findings further emphasize that the metamorphic gene expression programs of a. mexicanum are similar even when th concentration is varied by an order of magnitude.

discussion
paedomorphic mexican axolotls can be induced to undergo metamorphosis by administering th. we found that axolotls initiate metamorphosis at least one week earlier in  <dig> nm versus  <dig> nm t <dig> and complete morphological transformations in  <dig> days. the lower  <dig> nm t <dig> concentration was sufficient to induce metamorphosis but the initiation timing was delayed and this proportionally delayed the time to complete metamorphosis. the same sequence of morphological changes was observed between t <dig> treatments and the majority of degs were identified in both t <dig> treatments, although their expression profiles were temporally shifted. nearly all degs exhibited similar directional trends between treatments, and the subset of genes that were directly compared between the t <dig> treatments exhibited similar relative abundances. our results show extremely similar changes in gene expression and morphology in the axolotl when varying t <dig> by an order of magnitude. this is an interesting result because t <dig> concentrations within this range are toxic to anurans and are known to affect tissue-specific abundances of transcription factors that regulate metamorphic gene expression programs  <cit> . below, we discuss the axolotl's precise transcriptional response to the range of t <dig> concentrations examined in this study. we then discuss the epidermal gene expression program of the axolotl, noting gene expression similarities and differences between salamander and anuran metamorphosis.

th levels are known to increase in larval amphibians as they mature and reach maximal levels during metamorphic climax. when the concentration of th reaches a critical intracellular level, transcriptional changes are initiated that bring about new patterns of development. because the th concentration required to alter transcription is cell-specific, tissues are often described as having different sensitivities to th. the sensitivity of cells to th involves multiple factors that affect the intracellular concentration of th and the ability of th to affect transcription, which is determined in part by the number of nuclear th binding sites   <cit> . mexican axolotls have functional trs  <cit> , but th levels are apparently too low to initiate metamorphosis  <cit> . direct hypothalamic application of t <dig>  using a dose that is insufficient to initiate metamorphosis via intraperitoneal injection, is sufficient to initiate metamorphosis in the axolotl  <cit>  and related paedomorphic tiger salamanders  <cit> . thus, axolotls are capable of synthesizing th in sufficient quantities to initiate and complete metamorphosis. however, the pituitary doesn't release a sufficient amount of thyrotropin to trigger the metamorphic process  <cit> . axolotl epidermis can be stimulated to initiate metamorphic changes in vitro, in isolation of endogenously synthesized th  <cit> . thus, the metamorphic timing delay that we observed between the  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> treatments probably reflects the time required to autonomously activate gene expression within th responsive cells of the epidermis and the time required to stimulate the hpt axis. rosenkilde  <cit>  showed that this latency period is th concentration dependent and above a critical dose  there is no variation in latency. after accounting for an estimated one-week difference in the initiation timing of metamorphosis between the t <dig> treatments, there was not a difference in the length of the metamorphic period. thus, endogenous th levels were functionally, if not quantitatively similar between  <dig> and  <dig> nm t <dig> treated axolotls after metamorphosis was initiated. this idea is also supported by the precise gene expression response that we observed between the t <dig> treatments: essentially all of the genes were expressed in the same direction, and a subset of genes that could be reliably compared showed the same magnitude of gene expression.

the precision of the transcriptional response between t <dig> treatments indicates that axolotls are surprisingly tolerant to t <dig> levels that dramatically affect anuran mortality and gene expression. others before us have also noted the tolerance of axolotls to high levels of t <dig>  <cit> . because anuran metamorphosis involves a more extensive and integrated set of remodeling events that are accomplished over a shorter time frame, there may be greater overlap in the sensitivities of cells to th among tissues that causes metamorphic remodeling events to occur out of sequence. the fact that salamander metamorphosis encompasses fewer morphological changes and that many of the changes are not as integrated  may explain why axolotls are so tolerant to high t <dig> concentrations. however, failure to observe an increase in thyroid hormone receptor beta transcription in axolotl suggests there may be fundamental regulatory differences between anuran and salamander metamorphosis.

the larval epidermis of axolotls is extensively remodeled during t <dig> induced metamorphosis  <cit> . application of th to paedomorphic axolotls induces many of the same epidermal changes that occur during natural and induced metamorphosis in anurans, including apoptosis of larval cells, proliferation of adult cell types, and epidermal keratinization. our results show that th induces a diversity of transcriptional changes that are associated with specific remodeling processes. we observed significant gene expression changes between the t <dig> treatments at day  <dig>  prior to observable morphological changes at the whole-organism level. most of these genes were up regulated in the higher t <dig> concentration relative to the lower t <dig> concentration. day  <dig> gene expression changes may reflect direct transcriptional activation via the binding of exogenous th to trs, which are functional in axolotls  <cit> . for example, the human ortholog of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig>  a primary target for transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenesis, is known to have a thyroid hormone response element  <cit> . early up regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig>  as well as fructose  <dig>  bisphosphotase, glucose  <dig> phosphate dehydrogenase, and  <dig> kd heat shock protein  <dig> at day  <dig>  indicates a biochemical response at the cellular level that includes activation of key regulatory enzymes of the gluconeogenic pathway. this is an interesting finding for the epidermis because such responses are generally associated with hepatic cell functions. several other interesting gene expression changes were detected at day  <dig>  these include atp binding cassette, subfamily b, member  <dig>  and transglutaminase  <dig>  atp binding cassette family genes are up regulated in mammals during epidermal lipid reorganization and keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> , and transglutaminase  <dig> encodes an enzyme that functions in the formation of the cross-linked, cornified envelop of keratinocytes  <cit> . the early expression of these genes is curious because keratinization is assumed to be a terminal differentiation event in the metamorphosis of amphibian epidermis. our results suggest that the process of keratinization is initiated very early. as a final example, two proteins that are specific to the mammalian inner ear were identified as significantly down regulated: otogelin and otoancorin. the head epidermis of the axolotl contains mechanoreceptors that are homologous to hair cells of the mammalian ear  <cit> . our results suggest remodeling of these and other neural components in the axolotl skin at metamorphosis. there are many additional examples that could be highlighted from our gene lists that have not been previously discussed within the context of amphibian metamorphosis.

the most gene expression changes and the greatest changes in transcript abundances were observed at day  <dig> in  <dig> nm t <dig>  for example, keratin  <dig>  a prototypical marker of proliferating keratinocytes in mammals  <cit> , was up regulated  <dig> fold in  <dig> nm t <dig>  this also marks the time of the greatest morphological remodeling. after this time, gene expression levels of many genes decreased. thus, as has been described in anurans, many gene expression changes in axolotl are transient, increasing initially and then decreasing. for example, apoptosis is activated and terminated during anuran  <cit>  and salamander  <cit>  metamorphosis to regulate the death and replacement of larval epithelial cells. when statistically significant genes were analyzed in the absence of a two-fold change criterion, genes that were transiently up regulated  were statistically associated with apoptosis and proteolysis functional ontologies . as another example of the similarities between the metamorphic gene expression changes that occur in the epidermis of frogs and salamanders, we identified three distinct probe-sets with established orthologies to human uromodulin that are dramatically down regulated in the epidermis of metamorphosing a. mexicanum. furlow et al.  <cit>  have observed analogous results in x. laevis and have shown that xenopus uromodulin orthologs are exclusively expressed in the apical cells of the larval epidermis. these and other genes that are similarly expressed between urodeles and anurans will provide useful biomarkers for comparative studies of metamorphosis between these two groups.

our informatics comparison between degs identified from axolotl epidermis and xenopus intestine identified >  <dig> genes that are commonly expressed in these organs during metamorphic remodeling. however, over half of these genes were differentially expressed in opposite directions in axolotl and xenopus. for example, several genes associated with immune function  were down regulated in axolotl epidermis and up regulated in xenopus intestine. this is not too surprising because it is well established that the axolotl immune system is fundamentally different from that of other vertebrates, including xenopus  <cit> . additionally, genes expressed in opposite directions in these comparisons may reflect fundamental differences that exist between intestinal and epidermal remodeling. genes that exhibited similar transcriptional patterns between xenopus intestine and axolotl epidermis were associated with many different functions. for example, dna methyltransferase  <dig> and 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  <dig> were down regulated in axolotl epidermis and xenopus intestine during induced metamorphosis. in mammals, dna methyltransferase  <dig> functions to maintain dna methylation patterns that influence gene transcription  <cit>  and 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  <dig> preferentially inactivates androgens and estrogens,  <cit> . this later example suggests a transcriptional response to increase gonadal steroid hormone levels during epithelial remodeling in amphibians. as a final example, a presumptive ortholog to human keratin  <dig>  that was up regulated by >  <dig> fold in axolotls exposed to  <dig> nm t <dig> was also up regulated in xenopus intestine, albeit by a comparatively modest four-fold increase. these comparisons emphasize similarities and differences in gene expression during metamorphic epithelial tissue remodeling in anurans and salamanders.

CONCLUSIONS
recent microarray analyses of anurans and salamanders show that amphibian metamorphosis involves thousands of gene expression changes, involving many biological processes that have previously received little attention  <cit> . our results show similarities and differences in the metamorphic transcriptional programs of anurans and salamanders. we expected to identify similarly expressed genes because epidermis was included in anuran tissue preparations that were used for microarray analysis, and because tissue remodeling that occurs during metamorphosis appears to involve some evolutionarily conserved biological processes. we also expected to observe transcriptional differences because anuran and salamander lineages diverged >  <dig> million years ago. our results suggest that amphibian metamorphosis cannot be fully understood from the study of a few anuran species. we show here that axolotls offer several advantages  that can be exploited to provide complementary and novel perspectives on amphibian metamorphosis.
