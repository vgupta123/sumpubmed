BACKGROUND
eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences or introns that need to be removed from precursor messenger rna  in a complex process termed splicing. during pre-mrna splicing, relatively short exonic sequences are recognized by spliceosome, a large rna-protein complex. during splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together to form mature rna. in addition to splice site  signals at the exonic 5' and 3' ends, accurate discrimination of exons and introns requires additional auxiliary elements  <cit> . these conserved but degenerate motifs have been termed exonic  and intronic  splicing enhancers and exonic  and intronic  splicing silencers that activate or repress splicing, respectively. these elements are thought to bind splicing regulatory factors, including the serine/arginine-rich  proteins and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins  <cit> . consistent with this concept, splicing regulatory motifs were shown to associate with a single stranded conformation that is more accessible to protein-rna interactions  <cit> . combinatorial interaction of splicing factors bound by these motifs is important for both constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mrnas because they contribute to the regulation of gene expression and proteomic diversity across higher eukaryotes  <cit> .

several systematic computational approaches and in vivo or in vitro selection methods have been employed to identify these motifs in the genomic sequences. for example, the rescue-ese , a computational approach used in conjunction with experimental validation, predicted specific hexanucleotide sequences as candidate eses based on significantly higher frequency of occurrence in exons than in introns and also significantly higher frequency in exons with weak sss than in exons with strong sss  <cit> . the number of putative exonic enhancer and silencer octamers were computationally identified by their enrichment in internal non-coding exons versus unspliced pseudoexons and 5' untranslated regions of transcripts in intronless genes  <cit> . a cell-based fluorescence-activated screen , an in vivo splicing reporter system was used to identify esss that demonstrated consistent silencing results in a splicing reporter construct  <cit> . evolutionary conserved intronic splicing regulatory elements were found by considering intronic boundaries surrounding orthologous exons in homo sapiens, canis familiaris, rattus norvegicus and mus musculus obtained from ucsc genome-wide multiple alignments  <cit> . putative splicing regulatory sequences were reported based on evolutionary conserved wobble positions between human and mouse orthologous exons, along with overabundance of sequence motifs compared to their random expectation  <cit> . exonic and intronic elements have also been predicted based on strand asymmetry  <cit> . neighborhood inference  approach predicted eses and esss with activity in regulating biochemical processes based on the local density of known sites in sequence space  <cit> . finally, a recent study based on deep re-sequencing of human transcriptome  <cit>  uncovered a new repertoire of plausible intronic hexamers supporting the tissue-specific splicing events.

a large fraction of spliceosomal components are highly conserved across eukaryotes, including tetrapoda  organisms  <cit> , where the genes encoding well-known rna binding proteins involved in splicing regulation are enriched with ultraconserved elements  <cit> . three quarters of rescue-eses are shared between humans and mice  <cit> . most of the human rescue-eses  <cit>  have a pronounced bias towards exonic boundaries in more distantly related vertebrate organisms  <cit> . a number of experimental reports showed that genes from distantly related tetrapoda organisms were correctly expressed and post-transcriptionally modified in transgenic animals  <cit> . these observations suggest that splicing regulatory motifs shared by tetrapods may further enrich known elements for functionally important sequences. however, no systematic studies have been carried out.

in this work, we predict an extensive set of cis-acting elements identified in a large set of tetrapoda exons and characterize their overlap with previously identified silencers/enhancers. unlike in previous methods, we did not restrict the size of ese/ise/ess/isss oligomers unless they are longer than  <dig> nt. our prediction is based on the assumption that auxiliary splicing elements have pronounced statistically significant density increase/decrease towards the exonic boundaries compared to the deep intronic or exonic sequences. this assumption allows using the identified elements to improve performance of splicing prediction methods. predicted ises/isss close to the annotated exons were examined for increased evolutionary conservation as compared to oligos with no predicted functionality. finally, we investigated association of the elements placed in context with the single-stranded configuration of local pre-mrna structure.

RESULTS
identification of splicing regulatory elements in tetrapods
using  <dig> , <dig> extended tetrapoda exons, we predicted  <dig>  unique splicing regulatory elements that have statistically significant density increase/decrease in the vicinity of ss compared to the deep intronic or exonic sequences. a total of  <dig> eses/esss and  <dig>  ises/isss were found to support 3'ss, whereas  <dig> eses/esss and  <dig> ises/isss were found to influence 5'ss. clusters of predicted elements could be found in .

in primates, we predicted a total of  <dig> 5'ss-related and  <dig> 3'ss-related ises/isss , whereas in the outgroup  we have found  <dig> 5'ss-related and  <dig> 3'ss-related ises/isss . among the predicted elements for the primates and outgroup  <dig> 5'ss ises/isss and  <dig> 3'ss ises/isss were common between two clades. splicing regulatory elements predicted for these two distant clades heavily overlapped with the elements ascertained for the entire tetrapoda superclass , suggesting a remarkable conservation of cis-acting splicing regulatory factors in vertebrate evolution.

here is shown the ratio between the actual intersection and the expected intersection of the sets under the null hypothesis . an intersection between the two sets of elements is calculated as the number of all the possible longest common substrings lcs of the two compared elements a and b, with the size | lcs| ≡ min, in ordered pairs  coming from the cartesian product of the sets.

we compared groups of the predicted exonic and intronic enhancers/silencers to better understand the "splicing code" supporting the exon definition. as could be seen in  groups of ises supporting 5'ss and 3'ss sides intersect only half as expected by a random chance. this observation supports a hypothesis that independent mechanisms define neighboring exons and they do not share intronic enhancers located within common introns. on the contrary, isss are approximately four times more likely to be shared by the 5'ss and 3'ss sides, compared to a random chance expectation, and seem to play an active role in creating a "silencing" background within introns  <cit> . the group of 5'ss ises has substantial intersection with the 5'ss esss. this finding is consistent with previous observations that 5'ss ises frequently play silencing role if misplaced within exons  <cit> . this is further supported by a pronounced antagonism between 5'ss supporting ises and eses .

higher conservation of intronic elements
a higher evolutionary conservation of the elements found in the proximity of exonic flanks compared to the background sequences would be an important indicator of their functional importance in splicing regulation  <cit> . within  <dig>  multiple intronic flank sequence alignments we found a significantly higher conservation of the predicted intronic cis-acting octamers as compared to all other possible motifs . here we considered only the predicted octamers for uniform estimates of conservation scores, which would not be possible for elements of different sizes. conservation degrees of isss and ises shown in table  <dig> are similar, which suggests the importance of both enhancers and silencers in splicing definition.

non-
set of all other possible elements was obtained by excluding the ises and isss supporting either 5' or 3' sss from the set of all possible octamers. we counted cases where oligonucleotides stay entirely conserved versus changing in at least one nucleotide position between the pairs of sequences from multiple sequence alignments, where only the motifs containing no gaps were considered. in case of 5'ss elements we considered window of size  <dig> nt starting  <dig> nt downstream from 5' exonic boundary in human sequence, where in case of elements supporting 3'ss we considered  <dig> nt window ending  <dig> nt upstream of 3' exonic boundary.

secondary structure association with the elements
according to  <cit>  splicing enhancers and silencers are preferentially located in a single stranded region of rna as compared to the controls, especially in the vicinity of sss. this has been explained by the higher probability of trans-acting factors, such as sr proteins, to bind local single-stranded regions. we therefore determined the probability unpaired  values for the predicted elements . we considered only predicted octamers to obtain the pu values on the same scale which would be problematic for elements of different sizes. we examined sequences composed of predicted octamers surrounded with ±  <dig> nt context located in various segments of exons and introns as shown in figure  <dig>  pu values are known to be strongly associate with gc content of the motifs and the surrounding context  <cit> , therefore it would be most informative to evaluate the difference in the distribution of pu values for the same group of elements surrounded by wild type and dinucleotide reshuffled contexts. table  <dig> presents the average pu values for the elements located in the different segments before and after reshuffling.

we classified the predicted elements surrounded by ±  <dig> nt context according to segments of their location. the mean pu values calculated according to  <cit>  for wild type and dinucleotide reshuffled contexts are followed by significant p-values obtained with the wilcoxon two-sided rank-sum tests. only the p-values rejecting the null hypotheses  that the distribution is similar in the two groups of pu values are shown.

having the numerical series of pu values in various segments for different types of elements, we estimated if their distribution changes after dinucleotide reshuffling with the two-sided wilcoxon rank-sum test as shown in table  <dig>  our working hypothesis was that if predicted enhancers/silencers are preferentially supported by a single-stranded configuration then average pu values should go down after contextual reshuffling as it would most probably disrupt the naturally occurring local secondary structures. we did not find statistically significant discrepancies in the distribution of pu values after reshuffling the contexts of elements located in segments associated with ss regulatory functions  as shown in figure  <dig>  the only exception was the insignificant reduction of pu values for both 5' and 3' isss located in deep intronic segments as could be seen in table  <dig>  this statistical significance is highly reproducible and holds even for reduced size subsets of  <dig> isss examined deep inside intron .

implication of elements found in splicing reporter experiments
in order to investigate the implications of elements found in splicing regulation, we considered systematic mutation experiments presented in  <cit>  . the results of these experiments are interpreted through the mutation induced changes in the predicted 3'ss regulatory elements . original experimental design  <cit>  considered the influence of exonic silencers on selection of competing 3'sss in human gene coding for proinsulin  and hepatic lipase . here we noticed that according to  predicted 3'ss isss are three times more likely to overlap with 3'ss esss compared to overlap by random chance, which indicates that most of the 3'ss isss elements also act as 3'ss esss. this is further supported by noticing that fas-ess elements aggggt and ggaggg  <cit>  are similar to our predicted 3'ss isss ggagggg  and tggaggg  and a substantial overlap between predicted 3'ss isss and fas-ess decamers  <cit>  as could be seen in table  <dig>  as could be seen in  removal of our 3'ss isss generally results in increased inclusion of isoform  <dig>  and newly introduced 3'ss isss result in increased inclusion of isoform  <dig> . same tendency is observed in , where removal of 3'ss isss increases level of ivs- <dig> isoform inclusion  newly introduced 3'ss isss result in an opposite effect . introduction of 3'ss ese signal taggtc  results in increased ivs- <dig> isoform inclusion as expected . these findings suggest an active role of the predicted elements in sss regulation.

comparison of newly identified elements with known binding sites for rna binding proteins
to further support the functional importance of the predicted elements we compared elements found with the oligonucleotides already known to attract rna binding factors actively involved in splicing.

ca repeats bound by hnrnp l  <cit>  are located in clusters d.ie. <dig> and a.ie. <dig> . clusters d.ie. <dig>  a.ie. <dig>  a.ie. <dig> are enriched with elements ycay that bind the nova family of neuron specific splicing factors  <cit> . poly-g signal has been reported simultaneously as an ise signal  <cit>  when located downstream of a 5' splice site  and play a role of an exonic silencer  when located inside exon  <cit> . the g-run-binding factor hnrnp h is known to participate in exon definition  <cit> . compact cluster a.ee. <dig> contains hnrnp a <dig> selex predicted binding domain taggtc  <cit>  and clusters a.ie. <dig> and a.ie. <dig> contain hnrnp a <dig> binding elements taggg  <cit> . clusters a.ie. <dig> and a.ie. <dig> contain elements aggagga, cagagga, cagaggg that were identified by selex procedure as binding targets for sf2/asf enhancer  <cit> . clusters a.ie. <dig> and a.ie. <dig> are enriched with consensus binding motif actaac of star family rna-binding factors, in particular quaking homologue   <cit> .

elements tgtgt and tgtt were established as active cores of primary binding sites of etr- <dig> splicing regulator after five rounds of selex procedure  <cit>  where many clusters, such as a.ie. <dig> and a.ie. <dig>  are enriched with such elements. from aedb database  <cit>   <dig> motifs were selected known to influence splicing in their natural context  <cit> , many of these elements are similar to our predicted elements. we have identified  <dig> out of  <dig> confirmed splicing modulating motifs of size greater than  <dig> nt to intersect with our predicted elements as shown in .

CONCLUSIONS
using the orthologous exons currently available for  <dig> tetrapoda organisms we have identified  <dig>  unique splicing regulatory elements. among these elements  <dig>  3'ss and  <dig>  5'ss supporting motifs are novel and have not been previously reported in systematic screens detecting such elements. among our predicted elements,  <dig> % were octamers and  <dig> % of sequences were heptamers as compared to only  <dig> % hexamers and  <dig> % pentamers, suggesting that motifs of larger size play important role in splicing regulation. we detected intersections with some of the cis-acting elements reported in the previous studies, but not nearly as dramatic as we saw between the intronic elements predicted for primates and tetrapoda non-eutherian  clades. it demonstrates high reproducibility of our results obtained for various vertebrate lineages and supports the existence of highly conserved splicing regulatory code across vertebrates. this result also suggests the implications of elements found in regulating human splicing and may help explaining human hereditary disorders caused by mutations modulating such elements. we have established the higher evolutionary conservation for the predicted intronic cis-acting elements within mammalian intronic flanks which indicates their functional significance in exon definition. the elements found contain many of the known cis-acting factor binding sites with functionality supported by experiments with splicing reporter constructs. all these lines of evidence suggest active involvements of the predicted elements in control gradient directing spliceosome to the proper exons in the process of pre-mrna splicing  <cit> .

we did not observe statistically significant association for the predicted groups of cis-acting elements with the secondary pre-mrna local structure in the vicinity of the sss, except for slightly increased single strandedness detected for 5' and 3' isss deep inside introns. this observation is in contrast to the earlier reported  <cit> , where known splicing regulatory motifs were identified as more single stranded compared to controls in exonic vicinity. our result may indicate a potential mechanism of how isss-mediated silencing background keeps spliceosomal components inactive in the deep intronic sequences by providing stronger than normal binding affinity to preferentially single-stranded isss.

a remarkable intersection between the 5'ss isss and the 5'ss esss  is explained by the highly improbable chances of having elements containing a core fragment of a strong 5'ss competitor consensus in vicinity of a 5'ss. we have also established that many 3'ss isss act as 3'ss esss. these observations suggest that discovered splicing regulatory elements have broad functionality spectrum spreading beyond genomic segments where they have been originally found, such as possible regulatory role in 3'utr  <cit> .
