BACKGROUND
protein kinases are a major component of the complex signalling networks that coordinate all fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, cell cycle and metabolism. protein kinases and phosphatases elicit reversible phosphorylation, which enable the rapid cellular responses that are crucial for survival in a continually changing environment. protein kinases activate and deactivate proteins by addition of the gamma-phosphate from atp to serine , threonine , tyrosine , aspartate  or histidine  amino acid residues  <cit> . cascades of consecutive kinase-mediated phosphorylation events constitute the backbone of signalling pathways  <cit> . the complexity of the signalling networks scales with size. part of this complexity is constrained by the number of genes encoding protein kinases, also known as the kinome. the number of encoded protein kinases in free-living eukaryotes ranges from as little as  <dig> kinases in saccharomyces cerevisiae
 <cit>  to ~ <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit> . between these extremes, surveyed organisms include dictyostelium discoideum with  <dig> kinases  <cit> , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster with  <dig>  and homo sapiens with  <dig> kinases  <cit> . minimal kinomes are present in parasites that are not obviously representative of other tractable species. the kinome of the parasitic fungus encephalitozoon cuniculi
 <cit>  has only  <dig> kinases and lacks sequences that are ubiquitous in the kinomes of free-living eukaryotes, including the ste family, tor and ampk. e. cuniculi kinases are also highly divergent within fungi:  <dig> are reported to have no clear orthologs. the protozoan giardia lamblia can be grown in pure culture and has a small genome of only  <dig>  orfs with a core of only  <dig> kinases, of which  <dig> have no clear orthologs and  <dig> are giardia-specific  <cit> . the remainder of the kinome is composed of a large expansion of  <dig> nek kinases,  <dig> of which are likely to be catalytically inactive. g. lamblia kinase domains were also found to have a mean sequence identity of only 40% with h. sapiens, lower than plant and fungal kinases .

it was originally thought that s/t and y kinases were unique to eukaryotes, and that bacteria and archaea operated a parallel system of h and d phosphorylation. however it is now known that s/t and y phosphorylation is also important in both bacteria  <cit>  and archaea  <cit> . while many eukaryote-like kinases  in bacteria share only remote sequence similarity with eukaryotic protein kinases  they share strong structural similarities  <cit> . the rio and bud <dig> families of kinases are common to both eukaryote and archaea  <cit> . conversely, the histidine kinases  are also found in eukaryotes, where their roles include osmoregulation in several species  <cit>  and ethylene hormone signalling in a. thaliana
 <cit> .

a well conserved  <dig> –  <dig> amino acid catalytic domain, known as the epk domain  <cit> , is present in most protein kinases and mediates protein phosphorylation. a small subset of kinases do not possess the epk domain and are regarded as atypical protein kinases   <cit> . as epks are structurally related, a common evolutionary ancestry, distinct from apks has been proposed  <cit> . members of the protein kinase epk family  <cit>  are divided into the following major groups: agc , tk , tkl , camk , cmgc ; mitogen-activated protein kinases ; glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase-like ), ck <dig> , ck <dig> , ste , and aur . the tk family, particularly transmembrane receptor kinases, account for the majority of receptor kinases in humans and serve as cell-surface receptors for growth factors that trigger cell growth, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . non metazoan-eukaryotes, including the green lineage, do not possess genuine tks  <cit> . instead, y phosphorylation is substituted by dual-specificity kinases that phosphorylate s/t as well as y  <cit> .

in this study we survey the kinase components of o. tauri and assess its suitability as a model organism for eukaryotic signalling, based on two criteria:  reduced signalling complexity and  conservation of signalling components. o. tauri is a promising candidate as it is the smallest free-living eukaryote  <cit> , with a  <dig>  mb genome, encoding  <dig>  proteins with minimal genome duplication  <cit> . this reduced genome might impose simplified signalling. o. tauri is part of the chlorophyta clade within the plantae supergroup  <cit> , and is taxonomically positioned at the base of the green-plant lineage. given its size and taxonomic position, it is a promising candidate for generating hypotheses that can be transferred to more complex eukaryotes. o. tauri has a streamlined cell structure comprising a single nucleus, mitochondrion, golgi body and chloroplast  <cit> . it possesses several benefits as an experimental model, cells can be readily and rapidly cultured in controlled laboratory conditions, where they undergo simple binary cell-division which can be synchronised by light/dark cycles. it has already been used as a model for the eukaryotic cell-cycle, helping to unify current understanding of cell-cycle regulation across eukaryotes  <cit> . the lack of a cellulose plant cell wall facilitates transformation  <cit>  as well as organelle enrichment and protein extraction  <cit> . these genetic and proteomic tools have already been applied to studies of protein turnover  <cit> , nutrient deprivation  <cit>  and the plant circadian clock in experimental  <cit>  and mathematical approaches  <cit> .

we survey the o. tauri kinome and examine conservation of protein sequences, through phylogenies of kinase orthologs in a. thaliana, h. sapiens and s. cerevisiae as the most widely studied models of plant, metazoan and fungal kinomes respectively. we then focus on three pathways, 1) tor signalling in h. sapiens, 2) mapk-mediated gsk <dig> signalling in a. thaliana and 3) the core circadian clock. we evaluate the capacity of o. tauri components to support signalling in current models of these exemplar pathways. building on our recent proteomic surveys  <cit> , we examine a large set of phosphorylated peptides detected by mass spectrometry and use these to validate phosphorylation-mediated signalling events in o. tauri. in combination with the phylogenetic evidence, we discuss the suitability of o. tauri as a model species to study protein kinase signalling.

RESULTS
the overall proteomic similarity among o. tauri, a. thaliana, s. cerevisiae, and h. sapiens was revealed by a survey of shared ortholog-groups  identified by orthomcl  <cit> . this approach allows a comparison of shared sequences, despite the widely differing number of protein-family members in their proteomes. the proportion of ortholog-groups that were unique to o. tauri and s. cerevisiae was very similar, at 45% and 44% of their respective proteomes. o. tauri shares  <dig> % of the  <dig>  ortholog-groups present in a. thaliana. the o. tauri genome contains a comparable number of h. sapiens protein families  to the existing model species s. cerevisiae .figure  <dig>

we compared the number of protein kinases for each family in o. tauri with other model organisms, using an existing, high-level classification derived from  <dig> eukaryotic kinomes  <cit> . this data-mining approach was augmented by experimental identification of  <dig>  phosphorylated o. tauri peptides from  <dig> liquid-chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry  experiments. these correspond to  <dig>  uniquely identified phosphorylations of  <dig>  peptide sequences of  <dig>  proteins , including several conserved protein kinases, discussed below. in the process of identifying and categorising kinases in o. tauri, we identified a novel gene locus, corrected  <dig> existing gene models, and patched sequencing gaps in  <dig> gene loci with sequence information from ostreococcus lucimarinus data to generate a more complete database for peptide identification. protein domain diagrams are attached as additional file 2: figure s <dig> while the new and patched gene models and sequences are detailed in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  evidence of phosphorylation motifs conserved between species is presented in additional file 4: figure s <dig> 

o. tauriprotein kinase and phosphatase survey
a survey of the  <dig>  gene models  <cit>  currently annotated in the o. tauri genome revealed  <dig> genes encoding catalytic protein-kinases and  <dig> protein phosphatases, respectively amounting to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the known o. tauri loci . the o. tauri kinome occupies a similar proportion of the genome to that found in s. cerevisiae   <cit>  and h. sapiens   <cit>  and is proportionally smaller than the a. thaliana kinome   <cit> , with which it shares the greatest sequence similarity of components .

phosphatases, in contrast, do not scale with the size of the genome. the human phosphatase portal   <cit>  reports  <dig> protein phosphatases of which  <dig> are protein tyrosine phosphatases . the remaining 28 s/t phosphatases consist of two families, metal dependent protein phosphatases  and phosphoserine protein phosphatases . a. thaliana contains  <dig> phosphatases of which  <dig> are ptps and the remaining s/t phosphatases contain  <dig> ppps and  <dig> ppms  <cit> . s. cerevisiae contains  <dig> protein phosphatases  <cit> , which are composed of  <dig> ptps,  <dig> ppps and  <dig> ppms. the o. tauri genome contains  <dig> protein phosphatases, which are composed of  <dig> ptps,  <dig> ppps and  <dig> ppms. the higher proportions of s/t phosphatases to ptps in o. tauri resemble the proportions found in higher a. thaliana more than s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens. the dominance of the ppm family within the s/t phosphatases in o. tauri is consistent with a. thaliana and h. sapiens but is in contrast to s. cerevisiae.

a categorisation of kinases into families by sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis with the a. thaliana, s. cerevisiae, and h. sapiens kinomes confirmed the presence in o. tauri of all major epk families  present in the green lineage . we also observed six small, conserved families of epk-related protein kinases, which are classified as other-epks  <cit>  and five families of apks. no receptor-like kinases  were found in o. tauri
 <cit> . the main epk families account for a large proportion of the kinome in all the eukaryotes. o. tauri contains  <dig> tkl-like kinases, which is consistent with a large expansion of this family in the green lineage  <cit> . in contrast the tkl family is absent in s. cerevisiae and many other fungal genomes  <cit> . for such a small kinome, o. tauri contains a surprising abundance of  <dig> abc1-like kinases, which have few functionally-characterised orthologs in other species . recent experimental technologies for targeted gene knock-out in o. tauri will therefore greatly assist in the elucidation of their function  <cit> . within epk subfamilies, not all branches are equally conserved, as is evident in the following phylogenetic analyses .

the tor pathway: pikk, cmgc and agc kinase families
target of rapamycin  mediated signalling is vital to the regulation of growth and the key components exist throughout eukaryotes  <cit> . here, we describe the phylogenetic relationships within the kinase families that participate in the tor signalling pathway  <cit> , apk pi3k-related kinases , and the epk cmgc and agc kinases.

pi3k-related kinases : tor, atr, atm, trrap and dna-pk
a conserved family of cell-cycle control proteins, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinases  are a class of kinases originally named after their ability to phosphorylate the 3′-hydroxyl group of phosphatidylinositols. the pi3ks that also act as s/t protein kinases are called pi3k-related kinases . six pikks are present in eukaryotic genomes. several of these couple the dna damage sensing and repair pathway with the control of cell-cycle checkpoints, thereby maintaining the genetic integrity of the genome  <cit> .

the phylogeny of pikks  reveal that o. tauri contains four of the five pikk family proteins that are present in plant genomes  <cit> , namely tor, rad3-related , ataxia-telangiectasia mutated , transformation/transcription domain-associated  protein kinases. the fifth protein, smg <dig>  is absent in both o. tauri and a. thaliana, but is represented in oryza sativa . smg <dig> has also been identified in  <dig> other members of the green lineage, and knockouts in physcomitrella patens confirm a conserved role in the nonsense-mediated rna decay pathway  <cit> . an additional atr-like gene fragment  is also present in o. tauri but was omitted from the phylogeny analysis to prevent gaps in the alignment. the phylogeny consistently groups o. tauri sequences into the same clade as a. thaliana, distinct from the s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens group. the topology of the atm, atr, and tor branches of the phylogenetic tree indicates that the s. cerevisiae proteins sequences have diverged considerably from h. sapiens. unlike a. thaliana and s. cerevisiae, o. tauri additionally contains a dna-dependent protein kinase , which groups with the h. sapiens dna-pk in the pikk phylogeny with an 88% bootstrap confidence . within the green lineage, candidate dna-pk orthologs outside the chlorophyta could only be identified in p. patens  and selaginella moellendorffii , suggesting that dna-pk has been lost in higher plants. dna-pk has a well-defined role in the non-homologous dna end-joining  pathway  <cit> , and has recently been recognised in mammals as an important component in the stress-induced phosphorylation of replication protein a   <cit> . rpa in turn forms a heterotrimeric complex, which interacts with recombination components to repair dna double-strand breaks. unlike dna-pk, rpa is conserved across eukaryotes, and phosphorylation sites on rpa have been found to be conserved in yeast, metazoa and higher-plants  <cit> . dna-pk was also recently shown to be involved in innate immunity against viruses  <cit> . the presence of dna-pk in the o. tauri kinome makes a first case for o. tauri as a model system to study protein kinases , in this case in dna damage control and potentially in innate immunity.figure  <dig>

cmgc cell cycle family: cdk, mapk, gsk3
among the most conserved of the epks are the cell cycle regulating cmgc kinases, which are named after their constituent subfamilies: cdk, mapk, gsk <dig> and clk. we identified  <dig> cmgc kinases in o. tauri  and one cmgc-like gene. seven are cdks  – two of these are cdk <dig>  and the closely related plant-like cdkg . the five further cdks are the core cell cycle kinases cdka , cdkb , cdkc  cdkd  and cdke , which are present as single orthologs in o. tauri
 <cit> , while up to  <dig> paralogs exist in a. thaliana, s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens . this makes o. tauri a powerful eukaryotic model to study a simplified cell cycle  <cit> .figure  <dig>

mapks are s/t-specific protein kinases, closely related to cdks, their growth and stress-response functions – including osmotic shock, oxidative stress and temperature response in plants have been extensively reviewed  <cit> . we identified  <dig> plant-like mapks in o. tauri , which have  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> groups of paraologous genes respectively in a. thaliana. for mapk  we observed phosphorylation of a conserved y on the t-x-y motif of the activation loop , which indicates conserved modes of activation. the greatly reduced set of mapks in o. tauri is a remarkable feature of a highly reduced kinome.

gsk <dig> is a highly conserved eukaryote cmgc kinase. the chaperone heat shock protein  <dig>  regulates the autophosphorylation of the activating y in gsk <dig>  <cit> . pharmacological evidence links both hsp <dig> and gsk <dig> with circadian timekeeping in o. tauri
 <cit> . o. tauri, like other algae, has a single copy of gsk <dig> , compared to the ten found in a. thaliana
 <cit>  . the o. tauri gsk <dig> kinase domain diverges considerably on its branch between h. sapiens and a. thaliana. however, the o. tauri gsk <dig> sequence is closer to h. sapiens  than s. cerevisiae . o. tauri also contains a single ortholog candidate for hsp <dig>  , while a. thaliana has four hsp <dig> paralogs  <cit> . two closely hsp90-related clades in figure 3c, acting as outgroups to confirm hsp <dig> orthology, reveals further a. thaliana specialisation of hsps that is shared in the o. tauri genome.

agc kinases: pdk <dig>  s6k and pkg
members of the agc family are cytoplasmic s/t kinases , some of which contain ca2+ sensing domains, regulate glycogen metabolism and ion channel conductance. phylogeny across diverse eukaryotes has revealed a complex patchwork of conservation that suggests a history of successive contractions and expansions in the agc kinases  <cit> . one of the few constants across eukaryote lineages is the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase- <dig> . within a. thaliana only pdk <dig>  nuclear dbf2-related , ribosomal s <dig> kinase  are conserved  <cit> . similarly, within o. tauri pdk <dig> , s6k , and ndr  are also conserved. existing work has revealed an expansion of s6k and ndr into large and ubiquitous families across the kinomes of higher plants  <cit> . pdk <dig> is present throughout the green lineage but many orthologs, including o. tauri, lack a functional lipid-binding domain  <cit> . pka- and pkg-like kinases exist in higher plants and other streptophytes  <cit>  but these have diverged substantially: orthologs from the chlorophyta such as o. tauri have closer sequence similarity to metazoan and fungal sequences than the closest sequences in streptophytes have to any of these groups. the most pka- and pkg-like kinase sequence in o. tauri is ot02g <dig> . the plant specific light sensor phototropin <dig>  and incomplete root hair elongation   kinases are also present. o. tauri contains  <dig> agc and four agc-like kinases, of which  <dig> contain cnmp-binding domains .figure  <dig>

pdk <dig> is the most important member of the agc family in terms of phylogeny as it represents a highly conserved kinase, which has changed little since the divergence of eukaryotic agcs  <cit> . pdk <dig> in o. tauri is most similar to the two a. thaliana orthologs . it also groups closer to h. sapiens  than s. cerevisiae orthologs  . pdk <dig> is thought to be a basal conserved kinase, which predates the divergence of epks  <cit> , and is therefore used to root agc phylogenies . pdk <dig> has also been termed the ‘master kinase’ of agc signal transduction  <cit>  because of its critical role in cellular survival through the activation of protein kinase b  and s6k in humans  <cit> . however, out of these two pdk <dig> targets only s6k  is conserved in a. thaliana and o. tauri.

the camp-dependent protein kinases  and cgmp-dependent protein kinases  are part of the same sub-family of kinase domains  <cit>  and have similar domain components, and quaternary structure  <cit> . pkg is composed of a single protein with cgmp binding and protein-kinase activity. pka is a heterodimer composed of separate protein-kinase and camp binding subunits. the inactive complex disassociates when camp binds to the regulatory subunit, which releases the active protein-kinase component  <cit> . as with many agc proteins, a conserved c-terminal tail acts as a phosphorylation site for priming the protein-kinase active-site  <cit> . there are five agc kinases with cnmp binding domains in o. tauri. two of these  contain all three domain components and have kinase domains with the strongest similarity to h. sapiens pkas . ot13g <dig>  has the closest domain structure to h. sapiens pka/pkg, and appears at the base of a subclade with two other kinases , branching prior to the divergence of pka and pkg .

ot02g <dig> is assigned with low confidence  to the base of the pkg branch. however, it diverges near to the root of h. sapiens pka-like kinases, which results in the domain being closer to prkx  than to pkg ; prkx is part of the family of pka catalytic subunits  <cit> . this supports a pka like activity for the domain, rather than the more constrained pkg substrate specificity  <cit> .

the minimal tor pathway in o. tauri: an inventory
tor is highly conserved across eukaryotes and acts as a master regulator for nutrient-responsive growth in yeast, metazoa  <cit> , and plants  <cit> . s6k <dig> and s6k <dig> are targets of the tor pathway in a. thaliana
 <cit> , and rapamycin inhibits this pathway, as in other organisms. s6k contains a conserved c-terminal motif that is a target for tor phosphorylation and pdk <dig> binding, and this motif is highly conserved in o. tauri. in mammals, complexes of mtor with raptor  and rictor  mediate distinct signalling pathways. the lst <dig> protein is a common component of both complexes. equivalents for both mtor complexes exist in yeast  <cit> . o. tauri, like the rest of the green lineage, only contains components of torc <dig>  the kinase targets of torc <dig>  are absent from o. tauri, and across the green lineage. in contrast, s6k is a conserved as a target of torc <dig> in the green lineage  <cit> , suggesting that the torc1-containing mtor complex could be the prototypical pathway for tor signalling.

having established the phylogenies for the essential tor pathway components gsk <dig>  tor, pdk <dig> and s6k  and its essential regulators in o. tauri, we now turn to analysing the complex series of phosphorylation events of the tor pathway. the conserved o. tauri components required for gsk3-mediated s6k regulation are shown in figure  <dig>  overlaid with the mammalian interactions based on conserved phosphorylation motifs and binding sites. it has been suggested that gsk <dig> may initiate the activation process of s6k  <cit> . this involves a complex series of phosphorylation events by multiple components. activated s6k transmits the final tor pathway signal by phosphorylating the ribosomal protein s <dig>  initiating it to regulate the translation machinery. upstream, the activation of s6k is proposed to require the concerted action of three phosphorylation events by gsk <dig>  the torc <dig> complex and pdk <dig>  in this order.figure  <dig> 
schematic of the regulation of tor signalling and s6k activation in
o. tauri
. numbered connectors indicate the order of the stages of s6k activation, as proposed by shin et al. <cit> .  gsk <dig> phosphorylates s <dig> allowing the  phosphorylation of t <dig> by the torc <dig> complex.  phosphorylated t <dig> is able to bind pdk <dig>  which phosphorylates s <dig>  leading to the activation of s6k. additionally, tor mediated inhibition of s6k is shown, which may occur via tap <dig>  previously unannotated in the o. tauri genome. tap <dig> in yeast binds pp2a and prevents the latter from dephosphorylating the gsk <dig> target site of s6k.



in mammals, the first of these phosphorylation events is by gsk <dig> to the equivalent residue of s <dig> on the s6k turn motif  <cit> . the gsk <dig> target s/t-x-x-x-s/t motif at this site is conserved in s. cerevisiae, a. thaliana, and o. tauri . this residue is constitutively phosphorylated in mammals, and is a dephosphorylation target of pp2c. the presence of gsk <dig> is proposed to infer resistance to pp2c-mediated inactivation of s6k by countering dephosphorylation  <cit> . the phosphorylation of s6k by gsk <dig> at s <dig> is a pre-requisite for the subsequent phosphorylation of the c-terminal t <dig> by tor. the phosphorylation by tor in turn enables the binding of active pdk <dig>  <cit>  to the c-terminal motif. the activation of human pdk <dig> requires autophosphorylation of a s in the activation loop, which is also a 14-3- <dig> binding motif  <cit> . human 14-3- <dig> binds to the phosphorylated motif in pdk <dig>  <cit> ; 14-3- <dig> also regulates pdk <dig> in a. thaliana
 <cit> . the activation-loop s is conserved in a. thaliana and o. tauri pdk <dig> . there are only two 14-3- <dig> proteins in o. tauri , providing a limited number of candidates for pdk <dig> regulation. active pdk <dig> binds to the primed tor motif at the c-terminus of s6k . this allows pdk <dig> to phosphorylate a t residue in the s6k activation loop  <cit> , which is also conserved in a. thaliana and o. tauri . yeast and human tor phosphorylates tap <dig> , which affects the formation of a tap42:pp2a complex  <cit> . pp2a has been shown to dephosphorylate s6k  <cit> , but it is unclear what role this potential signalling pathway has on s6k regulation in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . both tap <dig>  and pp2a  are found within o. tauri and the green lineage, though the tap <dig> ortholog in o. tauri was previously unannotated.

we have shown conservation of the agc kinases in the torc <dig> pathway in o. tauri. key phosphorylation motifs and binding sites are also conserved, for all the components of the model proposed by shin et al.
 <cit> . no phosphorylation was detected for the three key residues of s6k in our phosphoproteomic surveys. s6k was present, as phosphorylation at s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> were detected and similar samples observed the unphosphorylated protein  <cit> . however, the lack of detected phosphorylation in o. tauri cannot be taken as contrary evidence as the quantity of observed phosphorylation in proportion to expected phosphorylation in o. tauri is still relatively low. for example,  <dig> phosphorylations of human s6k are currently known  <cit> , and assuming a similar quantity of modification in o. tauri we have observed in the order of 10% of phosphorylations.

the camk family: cpk and snrk <dig> 
the camk are an important family of s/t-specific kinases with functionally divergent roles, which are represented by five o. tauri genes and thirteen camk-like genes that are more distantly related . consistent with previous findings  <cit> , plant camks are highly divergent with yeast and human proteins. hence, we sub-classified the o. tauri camks based on the separate phylogenies of two plant sub-families: calcium-dependent protein kinases  and sucrose-nonfermentation1-related protein kinases . in plants camks have a large diversity of roles in extracellular signalling and target substrates in pathways such as carbon and nitrogen metabolism, homeostasis, transcription and proteasome regulation  <cit> .figure  <dig>

snrk are an important subfamily of conserved camks, which are related to snf <dig> in yeast. snrk <dig> kinases are the founding members and are most closely related to snf <dig>  it is also the only member of the snrk family which is present across all eukaryotes and core members are involved in energy regulation in the cell  <cit> , with a primary function in glycogen metabolism  <cit> . the o. tauri snrk <dig>  is most closely related to the a. thaliana snrk1s . in addition to the core snrks, a. thaliana contains a functionally diversified set of snrk subfamilies  <cit> , which are absent from o. tauri. the human ortholog 5′ amp-activated protein kinase  is equidistant to o. tauri and the s. cerevisiae ortholog snf <dig>  indicating o. tauri may also be a suitable model for snrk signalling in humans .

cdpks have many roles in biotic and abiotic signalling pathways  <cit> . two kinases exist in o. tauri  with clear cdpk domain architectures and kinase domains. these have recently been classified as group i algal cdpks  <cit> . cdpks are typically a large family, involved in a variety of roles specific to higher plants, including herbivore defence  <cit>  and abscisic acid signalling . these specialised functions indicate that kingdom-specific adaptations have driven the sequence diversity of cdpks. a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-related kinases  ot01g <dig> is also present in o. tauri . two other o. tauri kinases align more closely to the s. cerevisiae rad <dig>  than cdpks. ot15g <dig> has previously been classified as a group iv algal cdpk  <cit> . recent cdpk phylogenies by hamel et al.
 <cit>  have shown that plant camks are likely to have diverged between the emergence of group iv and i, which places ot15g <dig> and ot07g <dig> within two distinct clades for plant cdpks. the retention of group iv and i clades within the reduced o. tauri kinome suggests an important conserved role for these kinase in calcium signalling.

the map2k pathway and ste kinase family
the downstream effects of extracellular signals, which are mediated by kinases such as the camks and agcs, are the mapk cascades. these form signalling connections from the cellular environment into the nucleus, in order to affect transcriptional changes  <cit> . all but the final target of the mapk cascade are found within the ste family. here we examine the ste family of kinases with a view to understanding an exemplar mapk pathway from a. thaliana: the gsk3-mediated regulation of stomatal opening through a map2k target  <cit> . as for the previously described tor pathway, we first assess the relevant kinase orthologs in o. tauri.

the ste kinases contain the map4k, map3k and map2k components of the mapk cascade  <cit> . eight ste family kinases and an additional six ste-like kinases were identified in o. tauri . these include one map2k , two map3k , and two map4k  kinase candidates. in contrast, a. thaliana has  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> orthologous genes respectively, again emphasizing the potential of o. tauri as an experimental model for gene manipulation in mapk signalling studies. within map3ks ot13g <dig> is the only member of the mekk clade and ot17g <dig> is a cdc15-like protein. the stes are closely related to the tyrosine-kinase like  family, and contain the plant-raf kinase, which also act as map3ks  <cit> . ot12g <dig> is the only confirmed plant-raf kinase . it contains a constitutive triple response  <dig>  domain , confirming it as an ortholog of the ctr <dig> gene: a potential-map3k that in a. thaliana is negatively regulated by the ethylene responsive histidine kinase etr <dig>  <cit> .

o. tauri also contains a single plant-like apg <dig> kinase  with four orthologous proteins in a. thaliana. c-terminal phosphorylation of apg <dig> was observed in o. tauri. apg <dig> kinases in yeast and a. thaliana are a target for the negative regulation of autophagy by tor  <cit> , highlighting another conserved facet of the tor pathway.

the minimal map2k pathway in o. tauri
the brassinosteroid signalling pathway acts upstream of gsk <dig> in a. thaliana, to initiate gsk3-mediated inhibition of the mapk pathway, leading to stomatal regulation  <cit> . the central components of this pathway are found in o. tauri; however, neither the upstream brassinosteroid signalling pathway nor the downstream stomatal regulation components are present. similarly, in human and yeast cells mapk cascades create complex signalling networks in a diverse array of processes  <cit> , many of which are absent in o. tauri. despite the diversity of processes, these central mapk components from the cmgc and ste kinase families are among the most conserved protein kinase families in o. tauri .

the residues of map2k that are proposed to be part of the gsk <dig> phosphorylation motif s/t-x-x-x-s/t are conserved in o. tauri, a. thaliana, s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens. the conserved residues are s <dig> and s <dig> in the o. tauri map2k . the residues s <dig> and s <dig> are conserved with those required for activation of map2k in human  and yeast   <cit> . the motif surrounding s <dig> appears to be more variable across eukaryotes than the downstream gsk <dig> motif. the residue corresponding to s <dig> is phosphorylated by a map3k  in a. thaliana
 <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the o. tauri components associated with the map2k pathway, along with a proposed schema based on the current a. thaliana model. the bsu family of green-lineage phosphatases, shown to regulate gsk <dig>  are represented by a single member in o. tauri. the mapk pathway, which gsk <dig> inhibits in a. thaliana, also has only a small number of possible components in o. tauri.figure  <dig>

o. tauri
. bsu has been shown to dephosphorylate a y to inactivate gsk <dig> in plants  <cit> , which is conserved as y <dig> in gsk <dig>  hsp <dig>  which is conserved across eukaryotes has been shown to chaperone the autophosphorylation of the activating y <dig> in gsk <dig>  <cit> . conservation of s <dig> and t <dig> in the o. tauri map2k form part of a gsk <dig> phosphorylation motif, which when phosphorylated inhibit map2k activity in a. thaliana <cit> . the upstream s <dig> is a conserved residue required for activation by map3k.



circadian signalling: ck <dig> and ck2
circadian rhythms are ≈ 24 h biological cycles, which arose as adaptations to daily changes in the environment. the circadian clock regulates diverse processes across eukaryotes, from the sleep–wake cycle of metazoa to photosynthesis  <cit> . o. tauri is already in use as a clock model for both in vivo and in silico studies  <cit> . in particular ck <dig> and ck <dig> have been shown to be part of conserved transcriptional/translational feedback loops in eukaryotes that regulate circadian clocks, based on pharmacological and overexpression results  <cit> .

casein kinase  <dig> family
the ck <dig> family of kinases are named after the highly conserved ck <dig> protein. ck <dig> has a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of membrane trafficking, dna replication, wnt signalling, rna metabolism  <cit>  and cell cycle regulation through tubulin binding  <cit> . ck <dig> isoforms have also been shown to affect circadian rhythmicity in metazoa  <cit> , in the fungus neurospora crassa
 <cit>  and in o. tauri
 <cit> .

ck <dig> typically consists of a large number of paralogs per organism, a selection of which is shown in the phylogeny in figure 8a . the human kinome contains seven isoforms , of which the four least divergent are shown. the h. sapiens ck1δ and ck1ϵ form the first branch after the divergence of s. cerevisiae, with a bootstrap confidence of 99%. a. thaliana contains many ck <dig> paralogs, of which ckl1- <dig> are the most conserved. the closest a. thaliana ck <dig> has a distance of  <dig>  to the point at which h. sapiens and s. cerevisiae diverge from the other sequences . s. cerevisiae encodes three ck <dig> isoforms, of which the closest  is included in figure 8a. the o. tauri ck <dig> sequence  branches near the midpoint between a. thaliana and the s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens sequences, only a relatively short distance of  <dig>  away from the s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens branch. o. tauri contains four further ck1-like protein kinases, of which only one  is conserved in a. thaliana .figure  <dig>

based on taxonomic studies of eukaryotes  <cit>  we generally expect the chlorophyta branch of algae and plant proteins to be more closely related, with a smaller distance between sequences from metazoa and yeast. however, our data shows that the distance of the o. tauri ck <dig> to the base of the branch that contains h. sapiens sequences is less than half the distance of s. cerevisiae to this branch. a. thaliana ck <dig> sequences also appear to have diverged considerably. the o. tauri ck <dig> is the closest among these three model organisms to human ck1δ and ck1ϵ. this indicates that o. tauri may be an interesting model organism to study ck <dig> 

casein kinase  <dig> 
casein kinase  <dig>  is a highly conserved kinase, found across all eukaryotes. ck <dig> is centrally important in many signalling pathways and is one of the most ubiquitous kinases in terms of substrate phosphorylation  <cit> . ck <dig> is a tetramer composed of a ck2β dimer and two ck2α subunits. o. tauri contains a single catalytic ck2α  and regulatory ck2β  subunit. the topology of the phylogenies for both subunits is very similar, the o. tauri ck <dig> appears to be more similar to the a. thaliana, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens than s. cerevisiae sequences. s. cerevisiae ck <dig> subunits have diverged considerably, similar to ck <dig>  indicating that o. tauri may be interesting alternative model species for ck <dig> 

ck <dig>  ck <dig> and the circadian clock
ck <dig> is one of the few conserved components of the eukaryotic circadian clock  <cit> , where it fine-tunes period length and amplitude by dynamic modification of core-clock proteins. in a. thaliana, ck <dig> phosphorylates circadian clock-associated  <dig> and late elongated hypocotyl  and over-expression of the ck <dig> regulatory subunit ckb <dig> shortens the period of these clock genes, accelerating plant flowering time  <cit> . ck <dig> is involved in temperature compensation of the clock in fungi and plants, which allows for robust timekeeping  <cit> . within o. tauri we have identified ck <dig> motifs in cca <dig> which are conserved  with the observed a. thaliana sites  <cit> , which indicate that this interaction may be retained. we also observed an s <dig> phosphorylation, in a chlorophyta specific region, at the c-terminus of the myb dna binding domain which conforms to an e-x-s ck <dig> substrate motif. in metazoa, ck2α directly phosphorylates period . mutation of ck <dig> delays the nuclear import of per and lengthens circadian period  <cit>  . a mutation in ck2β also lengthens period  <cit> . ck <dig> regulates the mammalian clock by binding and phosphorylating the clock protein per <dig> at s/t residues in the n-terminus, thereby stabilising the protein and promoting nuclear accumulation of per <dig>  <cit> . diminished per <dig> stability can have opposing effects on the circadian period by affecting the timing of when per <dig> is accumulated in the nucleus – accelerated and prolonged nuclear import speeds up and slows down the clock, respectively.figure  <dig> 
the core transcriptional circadian clock of 
h. sapiens
and 
o. tauri
. ck <dig> and ck <dig> regulate both clocks though per and cca <dig> phosphorylation. the downstream core clock however differs: in h. sapiens, ck <dig> has been shown to stabilise per <dig> and promote its nuclear accumulation  <cit> . per <dig> in turn stabilises cryptochrome 1/ <dig> in complex, which represses the transcriptional activation of per1/2/ <dig> via clock/bmal1/ <dig>  creating an oscillating feedback loop. in o. tauri, ck <dig> phosphorylates the morning-expressed cca <dig>  and attributed to the tau mutation in ck1ϵ  <cit> . the tau mutation increases per <dig> and per <dig> phosphorylation, increasing proteasomal degradation, and shortening the circadian period  <cit> . ck <dig> control of the clock is exemplified by familial advanced sleep phase syndrome, a condition associated with early sleep time followed by early morning awakening, whereby a mutation to human per <dig> or ck1δ advances period . mutations to d. melanogaster ck1δ lengthen period, suggesting differences in the regulation between mammalian and insect clocks  <cit> . until recently, ck <dig> has not been implicated in plant clocks. there are early indications for a functional role for ck <dig> in the o. tauri clock  <cit> , however the exact targets of ck <dig> are unknown.

smaller kinase families in o. tauri
additional file 5: table s <dig> shows that the remaining protein kinases span a wide range of families, which are discussed in additional file 8: figure s6: two of the highly-conserved rio family, a polo-like kinase , an aurora kinase, bud <dig>  five stn-like kinases, two bub1-like kinases, haspin, and two hks. the o. tauri kinome therefore comprises a suitably diverse set to represent many of the known protein kinase functions in eukaryotes.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> gene loci encoding catalytic protein kinases in o. tauri, constituting a small kinome of a similar order to s. cerevisiae . as a photosynthetic model for core signalling, it is nearly ten-fold smaller than the a. thaliana kinome  <cit> . comparing a. thaliana, s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens sequences, we found o. tauri kinases were frequently more closely related to the h. sapiens sequences than were the s. cerevisiae orthologs . thus genome reduction in o. tauri has not led to divergence in its kinome, in contrast to the minimal kinomes of parasitic species. dna-pk is present in o. tauri and h. sapiens but absent in a. thaliana; pkg in o. tauri is also closer to the metazoan and fungal sequences than the closest a. thaliana sequences; several other components are conserved in exemplar signalling pathways , such as s6k activation via the torc <dig> pathway. together with other conserved components that are otherwise absent or poorly conserved in much of the green lineage, such as the cell cycle phosphatase cdc <dig>  <cit> , our kinome survey indicates that o. tauri is a reduced but representative laboratory model species for signalling research, which incorporates many eukaryote-wide signalling components.
