BACKGROUND
the rapid advances in sequencing technologies have facilitated the development of comparative genomics – an important approach in contemporary evolutionary biology research 
 <cit> . the stickleback fishes  provide an excellent model system for such comparative studies. the three-spined stickleback  has become a vertebrate ‘supermodel’ allowing a combination of studies at molecular, developmental, phenotypic, and population genetic levels to explore factors and processes relevant for adaptive evolution in ecologically relevant contexts 
 <cit> . the three-spined stickleback is a small teleost populating diverse ecosystems across a wide geographic distribution in the northern hemisphere and occurs in marine, brackish, and freshwater habitats. populations that have colonized freshwater habitats after the retreat of pleistocene ice sheets have evolved remarkable morphological and behavioral diversity as compared to marine populations 
 <cit> . for example, they have repeatedly evolved changes in body shape, skeletal armor, trophic apparati, pigmentation, osmoregulatory functions, life history, and behavior 
 <cit> . the genetic architecture for several of these phenotypic adaptations has been – or is being – deciphered 
. interestingly, the parallel evolution  of armor loss, pelvic reduction, and pigmentation has been found to result from parallel genetic changes in similar genes 
 <cit> . however, relatively little is known about the genetics of these or other traits in other stickleback species .

the nine-spined stickleback  is an emerging model for evolutionary biology research 
 <cit>  and has diverged from the three-spined stickleback around  <dig> million years ago  
 <cit> , but the two species are ecologically – and to some degree also phenotypically – very similar 
 <cit> . phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of the nine-spined stickleback demonstrate that their colonization and adaptation to freshwater habitats from marine environments has occurred independently multiple times 
. meanwhile, freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks have also evolved – repeatedly and independently – similar morphological 
, behavioral 
 <cit> , neurological 
, and physiological 
 <cit>  phenotypes in different localities. notably, similar adaptive traits also have been evolved in parallel between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks 
 <cit> . for example, both marine nine- and three-spined sticklebacks have a complete pelvis, but several different freshwater populations in both species have undergone a genetically based reduction - or even total loss - of the pelvic girdle and associated spines 
. however, it is still uncertain whether or not the genetic underpinnings of the pelvic reduction in nine- and three-spined sticklebacks are the same. for instance, shapiro et al. 
 <cit>  first suggested that changes of pitx <dig> expression might contribute to pelvic reduction in both species, but later discovered that the major loci controlling for pelvic development were completely different between the two species. this suggests that the pelvic reduction in these species is an example of genetic convergence 
 <cit>  . hence, nine- and three-spined sticklebacks offer a powerful opportunity to study whether or not similar phenotypic changes across species are associated with the same genes or genetic mechanisms.

a genome-wide comparative study can help us to better understand how selection has shaped divergence and illuminate the genetic basis of parallel evolution in nine- and three-spined sticklebacks. it can also reveal the extent of genome-wide differentiation across protein-coding and non-coding regions and the prevalence of species-specific genes that may influence the evolutionary trajectory of divergent species. however, compared to the three-spined stickleback with abundant genomic resources 
 <cit> , genomic resources for the nine-spined stickleback are still largely lacking . for example, development of microsatellite markers for study of nine-spined stickleback currently is based on the three-spined genome, but cross-species utility of microsatellite primers is limited due to low amplification success 
 <cit> . fortunately, the recent explosion of affordable next generation sequencing  technology provides evolutionary and ecological researchers a great opportunity to conduct genome-wide studies of non-model organisms with limited genetic and genomic resources 
. for instance, transcriptome, a collection of expressed sequences, represents a sample of the spatiotemporally expressed genome that can be used for comparative genomic studies at an interspecific level, as well as genetic diversity analyses at an intraspecific level. here, we used deep sequencing  to characterize partial brain and liver transcriptomic libraries of nine-spined sticklebacks from marine and freshwater populations exhibiting a high degree of morphological and genetic divergence 
. with the resulting transcripts, we  characterized the sequence divergence between the two closely related stickleback species,  investigated rates of molecular evolution for patterns consistent with positive selection, and  evaluated sequence differentiation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
we obtained a total  <dig>  high quality reads with mean length of 250 bp from  <dig> sequencing of four cdna libraries from nine-spined sticklebacks . contig assembly of the reads were combined from the four cdna libraries into one “nine-spined stickleback transcriptome” containing  <dig>  contigs ≥ 100 bp  with an average coverage depth of  <dig> reads .

functional annotation
a blastx search returned  <dig>   nine-spined stickleback contigs with significant hits to three-spined stickleback genes. this proportion of contigs with blast hits is similar to previous transcriptome studies 
, in which contigs without significant hits may consist of untranslated transcripts, chimeras or assembly artifacts. blast2go with the gene ontology  annotations database was used for further annotation and  <dig>  contigs have one or more go terms . we additionally found that  <dig> contigs had no significant blastx hit with protein sequences from the three-spined stickleback but had significant hits with protein sequences in at least one of the other seven fish genomes available from ensembl. by using blastn and blat searches, we confirmed that  <dig> of the  <dig> contigs had no hits in the current three-spined stickleback genome . because these contigs correspond to genes in other teleost genomes, this suggests that the orthologous sequences of these contigs have probably been lost in the three-spined stickleback rather than gained in nine-spined sticklebacks.

sequence comparison between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks
we found that  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  nine-spined stickleback contigs  had a pairwise ks ≤  <dig>  compared to their three-spined stickleback orthologs , and these had an average length of 690 bp . we restricted all further analyses to these  <dig>  contigs, or “unigenes”, in an attempt to curtail the effects of erroneously called orthologs with large ks values. the corresponding genes are more or less evenly distributed across the three-spined stickleback genome with  <dig> % to  <dig> % of genes on each chromosome, and the gene number per chromosome is positively correlated with chromosome size . given the conserved genomic synteny between the two species 
 <cit> , these observations suggest that the unigenes are a relatively unbiased sample of nine-spined stickleback genes in terms of genomic distribution.figure  <dig>

we used three methods to detect positive selection on genes in sticklebacks. we first calculated the pairwise substitution rates ks, ka, and ka/ks between the nine-spined stickleback unigenes and their putative orthologs in the three-spined stickleback . genes are generally under strong purifying selection , with a mean pairwise ks value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . a total of  <dig>  orthologous pairs had a ka/ks ratio between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and  <dig>  had a ka/ks ratio >  <dig> . the latter  <dig> unigenes are distributed across  <dig> chromosomes .figure  <dig>

we also performed the branch-site test with medaka as an outgroup to detect positive selection operating on sites along each stickleback lineage. the branch-site test revealed a total of  <dig> unigenes  that are putatively evolving under positive selection in the nine-spined stickleback lineage and  <dig> unigenes  in the three-spined stickleback lineage . we also found  <dig> unigenes  with sites evolving under positive selection in the ancestral lineage before the split between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks .

a third method was used for inferring positive selection by utilizing nine-spined stickleback snps. we analyzed the patterns of selection among genes with the mk test and the direction of selection . we found  <dig> unigenes that departed from neutrality ,  <dig> of which show a signature of positive selection . however, none of these signatures remained statistically significant after correction for multiple tests.

it is noteworthy that positive selection on seven genes was detected by at least two of the three methods mentioned above. for example, two genes with a pairwise ka/ks ratio ≥  <dig> that are involved in lipid transport are also detected using the branch-site test, of which one gene  is consistent with positive selection in the nine-spined stickleback lineage and the other gene  is consistent with positive selection in the three-spined stickleback lineage. other overlaps from methods of detecting positive selection include a gene  detected by the mk test and the branch-site test in the nine-spined stickleback lineage, and four genes  detected by both pairwise ka/ks and the mk test. combining all three tests, we found a total of  <dig> genes with patterns of adaptive evolution in either the nine- or three-spined stickleback, or both. these genes are distributed rather evenly across all of the three-spined stickleback chromosomes except xiv . we found  <dig> of these  <dig> genes with associated go annotations spanning a broad range of functions . we found that nine go terms  were significantly overrepresented among these  <dig> genes by comparing to all three-spined stickleback genes, which suggested that these  <dig> genes have been subject to adaptive evolution .figure  <dig>

 <cit> .



a total of  <dig> nine-spined stickleback unigenes contained partially sequenced utrs ≥ 50 bp. the average k2p distance of these utrs and their three-spined stickleback orthologous sequence was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , whereas the average k2p distance of the coding regions for these same genes was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the average pairwise ks for the  <dig> unigenes was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and is close to that of the all  <dig>  unigenes , which suggests no bias of the  <dig> unigenes with utr information, at least with respect to ks. the divergence of utrs was significantly higher as compared to the divergence in corresponding coding regions  but significantly lower than that of ks , which suggests that utrs have evolved under lower selective pressures than coding regions, albeit not neutrally . based on the divergence estimates above and the species divergence time of  <dig> mya 
 <cit> , we calculated the substitution rate as  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per year in coding regions  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per year in utrs between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks.

divergence between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks
we found  <dig>  snps  among  <dig> unigenes in the sampled nine-spined sticklebacks . many of the snps  are predicted to be nonsynonymous changes, while the remaining are either synonymous  or in utrs  . we found  <dig> snps in  <dig> unigenes  that lead to ‘fixed’ genotypes between the two ecotypes, including  <dig> homozygous differences. these divergent snps occur in both tissue types and as such are not tissue-specific differences but most probably reflect general genetic differences between the ecotypes . of the fixed homozygous differences, five are nonsynonymous snps, ten are synonymous snps and two are snps found in utrs .

discovery of microsatellite markers
microsatellites are important genetic markers for non-model organisms and have been widely used for studies of nine-spined sticklebacks 
 <cit> . we analyzed the nine-spined stickleback unigenes to identify microsatellite markers. we obtained  <dig> ssrs in  <dig> unigenes . in terms of abundance, dinucleotide repeats were most abundant  followed by trinucleotide repeats , mononucleotide repeats ,  <dig> tetranucleotide repeat, and  <dig> hexanucleotide repeats. of the  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> are perfect and  <dig> are compound. ac/gt  was the most abundant dinucleotide repeat motif and agg/ctt  was the most abundant trinucleotide repeat motif.

discussion
the nine-spined stickleback transcriptome
in recent years, the use of comparative genomic approaches in a phylogenetic framework has shed much light on a variety of fundamental evolutionary questions, such as adaptive evolution 
 <cit> , genetic variation 
, and speciation 
. development of genomic resources is the first step towards such biological questions. using  <dig> pyrosequencing, we have contributed to the improvement of genomic resources for nine-spined sticklebacks. we provide over three thousand transcript sequences that correspond to an orthologous gene in the three-spined stickleback, and report hundreds of genic microsatellites that can be used as markers in future experiments with nine-spined sticklebacks. the data provided here significantly increase the number of available gene sequences for nine-spined sticklebacks since there are currently fewer than  <dig>  sequence entries in the national center for biotechnology information. given its status as an emerging model for evolutionary biology research 
 <cit> , this transcriptomic data will be of interest to researchers investigating the evolution of nine-spined sticklebacks, for example by using the identified snps or microsatellite markers for population genetics studies. it also allows for more refined inferences concerning stickleback and teleost evolution in a phylogenetic framework by providing orthologs of closely related fish species. thus, apart from contributing a large number of new gene sequences to the research domain, the results of this study represent the first reported nine-spined stickleback transcriptomic resource, and as such, provide a starting point for intra- and inter-specific genomic comparisons in sticklebacks.

sequence divergence between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks
the nine-spined stickleback transcriptome characterized in this study allowed us to survey sequence divergence between two closely related species – nine- and three-spined sticklebacks. because the two species diverged  <dig> mya 
 <cit> , we anticipated that the genetic differences would be considerable despite the highly ecological, phenotypic, and genetic similarities between the species 
 <cit> . the rate of sequence substitution is of central importance to understand mechanisms underlying molecular evolution. rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions are good indicators of selective pressures at the sequence level of protein-coding genes 
 <cit> . synonymous sites usually evolve neutrally and can provide insights on the background rate of sequence evolution 
 <cit> , thus we used the ks values of protein-coding genes to estimate neutral substitution rates in sticklebacks. the average substitution rate was estimated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per synonymous site per year between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks  when calibrated to the divergence time of  <dig> mya. this rate is faster than previously published genome-wide substitution rate estimates available across mammals , but is nearer the substitution rate of teleosts  as the rates of molecular evolution in fish are known to be fast compared to other vertebrates 
 <cit> . additionally, the unigenes we identified may be enriched with highly expressed genes that are more easily detected in transcriptomic sequencing, and thus the estimated substitution rate might be an underestimation because highly expressed protein coding genes usually evolve slowly 
 <cit> . nevertheless, this estimated substitution rate should be a useful yardstick for research in teleost molecular evolution in general, and particularly for those studies on stickleback phylogeny and molecular clock dating.

identifying genes that show evidence of positive selection can help us in understanding whether closely related species occupying similar ecological niches share genetic attributes involved in adaptation. the ka/ks ratio  is often used for diagnosing the extent and direction of selection on sequence evolution 
 <cit> . using three analyses based on nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions, a total of  <dig> genes show indications of positive selection in one or both species of sticklebacks. these  <dig> genes have significantly smaller pairwise ks  but significantly larger pairwise ka  compared to the other analyzed genes . despite a broad range of go annotations that these genes are involved with, we found that they showed enrichment in several functional categories. such genes may be of particular interest for further studies aiming to investigate their detailed functions, as well as possible associations with ecological differences between stickleback species.

in addition to coding sequence changes, regulatory sequence changes may play an important role in repeated adaptive evolution of freshwater three-spined sticklebacks 
 <cit> . in general, utrs, especially 3′-utrs, are found to evolve neutrally among very closely related taxa 
 <cit> . however, we found that utrs between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks are under stronger purifying selection as compared to synonymous sites, but under more relaxed selection as compared to coding regions . these findings suggest that some utrs may be important in shaping stickleback evolution 
 <cit> .

gene gains and losses are important processes contributing to evolutionary innovation and differentiation 
 <cit> , perhaps especially so in teleosts because of the teleost-specific whole genome duplication event 
 <cit> . the comparison between stickleback orthologs revealed that some genes are likely to have been lost in the three-spined stickleback, as they exist both in nine-spined sticklebacks and other model fish genomes. it is also possible that these genes are missing from the current three-spined stickleback genome assembly, or that the genes have evolved so rapidly that they no longer resemble the same gene in other fishes. of the genes that might have been lost in three-spined sticklebacks, nine have associated go terms related to binding , cell migration, and membrane component. however, a more complete grasp of the number of genes differentially lost and retained between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks can only be answered with a complete nine-spined stickleback genome. nevertheless, our results suggest that as in the case of other vertebrates 
 <cit> , stickleback divergence is also accompanied with gene losses.

however, we are aware that our results largely depend on the initial dataset for which we can make comparisons between genes. because we used a subset of all genes in the genome, we cannot capture the entire list of variation and genes that are evolving under positive selection. in fact, our dataset may further be biased towards slowly evolving genes under stronger purifying selection if we are capturing mainly highly expressed genes, and those with low ks values. nevertheless, our results should provide a useful first step towards unraveling the genetics underlying divergence between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks. taken together, our analyses of substitution rates, positive selection and gene loss suggest that there are considerable genetic differences between these two ecologically and phenotypically similar species.

genetic divergence between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks
much research has been directed towards investigating genome-wide divergence between marine and freshwater three-spined sticklebacks and many genes associated with their divergence have been identified 
 <cit> . genetic differentiation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks also has been described in studies utilizing microsatellites 
 <cit>  and restriction-site-associated dna sequencing 
 <cit> . for example, shikano et al. 
 <cit>  found several functionally- and physiologically-important genes that had experienced divergent selection between different habitats, and bruneaux et al. 
 <cit>  showed that genomic regions enriched for genes having functions related to immunity, chemical stimulus response, lipid metabolism, and signaling pathways had experienced positive selection. however, in-depth genome-wide studies of genetic differentiation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks have been lacking. here, we probed the genome-wide genetic differentiation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks to understand whether similar or different genetic changes underlying divergence between freshwater and marine populations exist in the two stickleback species. we found  <dig> genes with ‘fixed’ genotypes between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks , and these represent candidates for ecotypic differentiation in nine-spined sticklebacks. interestingly, one of these genes, the enolase 1a  gene has also been found to be associated with the divergence of marine and freshwater three-spined sticklebacks 
 <cit> . atpases are another group of interesting genes that have been associated with the marine and freshwater divergence in sticklebacks. we found that the atp5b and atp6v1ba genes have snps differentiating marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks, and similar evidence is available from atp6v1aa <cit>  in nine-spined and atp6v0a <dig> and atp6v0e <dig> in three-spined sticklebacks 
 <cit> . furthermore, a transferrin gene  with a putative function in iron ion transport may be of particular interest for understanding adaptive population divergence of marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks, since ion concentration is one of the notable environmental differences demarcating marine and freshwater habitats. hence, enolase 1a, atp5b, atp6v1ba and transferrin provide promising candidates for further investigations focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of differentiation and adaptation between marine and freshwater stickleback populations. further studies screening more populations and individuals are needed to evaluate the robustness of these results, as well as to understand how often adaptive divergence between marine and freshwater populations of different stickleback taxa is occurring through evolution in the same or in different genes or genetic elements.

CONCLUSIONS
with the massively parallel pryrosequencing of nine-spined stickleback cdna libraries, we identified over three thousand unique gene transcripts and hundreds of genic microsatellites. using these transcripts, we calculated sequence substitution rates in coding regions, in utrs, and across synonymous sites between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks. we identified over a hundred genes with molecular patterns of positive selection in one or both stickleback lineages and found several candidate genes that might be involved in differential adaptation between marine and freshwater nine-spined sticklebacks. both the same and different genes were found to associate with marine and freshwater divergence across stickleback taxa. apart from these specific findings, the study brings about significant amount of new resources  to the reach of the research community interested in fish and stickleback genomics in particular.
