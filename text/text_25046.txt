BACKGROUND
brassicaceae is a large family, consisting of approximately  <dig> genera and more than  <dig>  species
 <cit> . in addition to providing vegetable oil, vegetables, fodder and condiment, brassicas are important sources for dietary fiber, vitamin c and other nutritionally beneficial factors such as anticancer compounds
 <cit> . cytogenetic research of the six cultivated species has shown that the group includes three diploid species, b. rapa , b. nigra , b. oleracea ], and three amphiploid species, b. juncea , b. napus  and b. carinata ]. in addition, interspecific hybridization studies demonstrated that three diploid species contain the basic chromosome sets, while the amphiploid species contain hybridized and naturally doubled combinations of the three diploid species in a relationship that is referred to as u’s triangle
 <cit> . the genome sizes of the diploid brassicas and the allopolyploids are 529– <dig> mb and 1068– <dig> mb respectively
 <cit> .

long-term cultivation and artificial selection of brassica crops have resulted in rich intraspecific morphological variations all of which are adapted for various cultivation conditions
 <cit> . for instance, well-established vegetables of the b. oleracea species comprise a number of morphologically diverse crops, including cabbage , brussels sprouts , kale , kohlrabi , chinese kale , broccoli  and cauliflower .

cabbage  is considered to be a typical representative of the c genome of brassica and the b. oleracea genome sequencing project  was launched in  <dig>  the b. oleracea material that was used for the de novo sequencing was an advanced homozygous inbred line 02– <dig>  the primary sequencing project has been completed and the findings will be published shortly. to anchor the assembled scaffolds to pseudochromosomes, a high-density genetic map based on sequence-tagged pcr-markers is required.

a high-density genetic map can also form the basis for quantitative trait loci mapping , marker assistant selection , and functional gene positional cloning, and will be useful for functional genomics and genetic breeding studies. a comparison of the genetic maps of closely related species will contribute to an understanding of the origin of relationships among the brassicas, and genetic maps can provide insights into genome organization and evolution through comparative mapping.

more than ten genetic linkage maps of b. oleracea have been constructed
 <cit> . the early genetic maps used restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers
 <cit> . however, rflps requires a large amount of dna and the procedure is inefficient and difficult to apply in breeding. with the invention of the polymerase chain reaction , a variety of pcr-based markers, such as simple sequence repeats  were successively developed and became the preferred markers. ssrs require only small amounts of dna, are easily generated by pcr, are amenable to high-throughput analysis, codominantly inherited, multi-allelic, highly polymorphic, abundant, and are evenly distributed in genomes
 <cit> . ssrs have been extensively used in tagging qualitative genes and in dissecting the genetic bases of complex traits
 <cit> . recent developments in sequencing technology have simplified and accelerated the discovery of sequence variants, enabling the development of sequence-based markers including single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion/deletion polymorphism  markers
 <cit> . snps are the markers of choice for high-resolution genetic mapping and association studies because of their abundance and widespread distribution throughout the genome
 <cit> . these third generation markers, however, have rarely been used for genetic linkage mapping in b. oleracea.

b. oleracea genetic maps are most often constructed using populations obtained from crosses between subspecies and varieties, and f <dig> populations that are not immortal
 <cit> . f <dig> mapping populations are temporary and difficult to maintain for long term and comparative studies. to produce high-resolution genetic maps for future research, double haploid  and recombinant inbred line  populations are more often used for mapping. however, to date, no studies have reported the use of a dh population for mapping between cabbage varieties.

we generated a double haploid  population derived from an f <dig> cross between two advanced homozygous inbred lines, 01– <dig> and 02– <dig>  by microspore culture. a number of ssr and snp markers were developed using the whole genome shotgun sequence data from the brgsp. these markers were then used to construct a saturated genetic map of the b. oleracea genome that could be used to anchor and orientate sequence scaffolds from the b. oleracea genome assembly.

methods
development of a mapping population and dna isolation
two diverse advanced homozygous inbred lines of cabbage, 01– <dig> and 02– <dig>  were used as the parents to develop a doubled haploid  mapping population containing  <dig> lines. the dh population was derived from the f <dig> by microspore culture
 <cit>  and contained lines with a wide variety of morphological traits.

total dna was isolated from the expanding leaves of three-week old plants using the modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  method
 <cit> . the genomic dna samples were adjusted to  <dig> ng dna/μl and preserved at −20°c until used as the templates for pcr amplification. additional, leaf tissue was lyophilized for use in future experiments.

marker sources
the two marker types  were obtained from seven sources including genomic dna sequence data and gene or est databases . a total of  <dig>  ssr markers were developed from the cabbage sequence scaffolds and  <dig>  snp markers were developed by resequencing the other parent  of the b. oleracea mapping population. the  <dig> published ssr primer pairs derived from the genomic sequences of b. rapa , b. oleracea , b. napus  and b. nigra , were obtained from the brassicadb database
 <cit> . the fito markers were designed by iniguez-luy
 <cit> . a total of  <dig>  ests in b. oleracea were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information  for the identification and development of  <dig>  est-ssr markers
 <cit> . professor liu kede from huazhong agricultural university developed  <dig> markers with the data from the brassica.info database
 <cit> . the data for the bac end sequencing generated  <dig> ssr markers. the remaining  <dig> ssrs were derived from the b. rapa genome. a total of  <dig>  primer sets were developed for the  <dig>  ssr and  <dig>  snp markers and used to scan for polymorphisms between two parents. 

analysis of molecular markers
ssr detection
the process used for ssr markers development is presented in figure
 <dig>  first, all ssrs were identified and selected using misa
 <cit>  in the assembled sequences and expressed sequence tags. the minimum repeat units for mnrs , dnrs , tnrs , ttrs , pnrs , and hnrs  were chosen to be  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the maximum difference was  <dig> base pairs between two ssrs. 

ssr markers
first, the redundant ssr-containing sequences were identified by tgicl software . second, ssr primer pairs were designed using the primer  <dig>  program
 <cit> . the primer lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, with an optimum size of  <dig> nucleotides. the melting temperatures ranged from  <dig> to 65°c, with an optimum temperature of 55°c. the optimum gc content was set to 50%, with a minimum of 40% and a maximum of 60%. the predicted pcr products ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. third, the primer pairs were then filtered by e-pcr with default parameters
 <cit> . all primers were synthesized by the engineering company, shanghai, china.

dna amplification of the ssr markers was carried out in volumes of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig> unit of taq polymerase,  <dig>  μm of each of the primers,  <dig> μm dntps,  <dig> μl 10 × buffer  and  <dig> ng of genomic dna as templates. the pcr profile was as follows: initial  <dig> min at 94°c, then  <dig> cycles, each with  <dig> s dna denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> s annealing at 55°c and  <dig> s extension at 72°c, and a final extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr was carried out in a geneamp pcr system  <dig> .

snp markers
firstly, a lot of snps  were identified between the 01– <dig> and 02– <dig> by soapsnp software . secondly, the snp-contained sequences were extracted for primer design by snaper
 <cit>  using the default parameters. a total of  <dig>  snps were transferred into snap makers for genotyping via page . pcr amplifications were performed in a volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> ng genomic dna,  <dig> μl 10 × taq buffer ,  <dig> μm dntps,  <dig>  μm each primer and  <dig>  unit taq dna polymerase. the pcr profile was as follows: initial  <dig> min at 94°c, then  <dig> cycles, each with  <dig> s dna denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> s at the appropriate annealing temperature  and  <dig> s extension at 72°c, and a final extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr was carried out in a geneamp pcr system  <dig> . the pcr products were separated on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. after electrophoresis, the gels were stained as previously described
 <cit> .

linkage analysis and map construction
for map construction, the segregation in the dh population was analyzed for all the ssr markers that showed polymorphisms between the parental 01– <dig> and 02– <dig> lines. the markers contained two types of genotypic data: type a, the same as parent line 01– <dig>  and type b, the same as parent line 02– <dig>  data that were unclear or missing for various reasons were indicated by ‘-’.

markers which were reproducibly polymorphic between the parental lines were scored in the dh population. linkage analysis and map construction were performed using joinmap version  <dig> 
 <cit> . linkage groups were identified in the lod  of odds) grouping threshold range of  <dig> – <dig> , and linkage groups were assigned as c01–c <dig>  corresponding to the c-genome linkage groups of b. napus <cit> . maps were generated for each linkage group using a recombination frequency below  <dig>  and lod scores above  <dig>  for all the markers within each linkage group. a ‘ripple’ procedure was performed after the addition of each marker and the ‘jump’ thresholds were set to  <dig>  recombination frequencies were converted to centimorgans  using kosambi’s method for map-distance calculation
 <cit> .

marker distribution analysis
to evaluate whether the mapped markers were randomly distributed on the linkage map, the linkage groups were divided into  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cm blocks, and the number of markers per block was counted. observed frequencies of the number of markers per block were compared with the expected ones by performing a chi-square test , using a poisson distribution function, p = e-μμx/x!, where x is the number of markers per block and μ is the average marker density in the consensus map. average marker density  was used to calculate the expected binomial frequencies for each marker class per block interval for all the linkage groups. the distribution of markers on the linkage groups was also evaluated separately for the ssr and snp markers.

RESULTS
development of the mapping population
a total of  <dig>  normal embryos were obtained from the 01-88 × 02- <dig> f1by microspore culture. each bud generated approximately 70– <dig> embryos. after plant regeneration,  <dig>  plants consisting of  <dig> haploids,  <dig> doubled diploids,  <dig> polyploids, and  <dig> chimeras were obtained. finally, a dh population including of  <dig> individuals were obtained.

marker development
a total of  <dig>  putative ssr sequences were identified from the cabbage assembled scaffold sequences. the frequencies of the different types of ssrs in the genome are listed in table
 <dig>  six different ssr repeat types were indentified, and of these the mnrs  were the most abundant and the hnrs were the least abundant . among the dnrs, n was the most abundant repeat motif , followed by n  , n  and n. all ten possible combinations of tnrs were observed in the ssrs. among them, the n motif was the most common , followed by the n , n , n  and n  motifs. four main combinations of ttrs, four of pnrs and four of hnrs were also observed . all the other repeat types were very rare in the b. oleracea genome.

a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps were detected between 01– <dig> and 02– <dig>  of these the a/g snp type  was the most abundant and the g/c snp type was the least abundant. while the a/c snp type accounted for  <dig> %  and the a/t snp type accounted for  <dig> %. a total of  <dig>  snp markers were transfered to snap markers for genotyping the mapping population.

a total of  <dig> , <dig> est were downloaded from ncbi. a total of  <dig>  ssr loci were detected from the est sequences . the proportion for the mnrs and tnrs in brassica est sequences was higher than in b.oleracea genome sequences except aat motif. the frequency of the most types of repeat units  in the genome was higher than that in ests except three motifs . especially at motif frequency in the genome  was much higher than that in ests .

analysis of polymorphic markers
to construct the map, a total of  <dig>  markers were screened with the dna from the 01– <dig> and 02– <dig> parental lines. fifteen percent  of the markers were polymorphic , including  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig>  snps. the snps were more useful than the ssrs for map construction.

skewed segregation of markers
because of differences among genotypes in their responsiveness to microspore or anther culture, most of the brassica linkage maps based on dh populations contain markers with skewed segregations
 <cit> . in the present study,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  markers  that were polymorphic between the two parental lines were assigned to linkage groups. of those,  <dig>  had skewed segregation patterns, including  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig>  snps . there were segregation distortion regions  in all of the linkage groups except c <dig> and c <dig>  the markers in the sdrs were randomly distributed. c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> with five sdrs each had the highest numbers. the longest sdr, with  <dig> markers, was on c <dig>  where it covered  <dig> % of c <dig>  the shortest sdr with only  <dig> markers was in c <dig> and c <dig> . 

asdrs, segregation distortion regions.

construction of the high-density genetic map
the genetic map that was constructed includes  <dig>  markers  assigned to nine linkage groups designated c01–c <dig> , the same as the number of haploid cabbage chromosomes . only  <dig> markers  were not linked on the map. the map spanned a total of  <dig>  cm. because the cabbage genome size is approximately  <dig> mb
 <cit> , the current map represents average genetic and physical intervals of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  kbp per marker, respectively, making it the most saturated linkage map for b. oleracea to date. 

the largest linkage group  contained the largest number of markers  and spanned  <dig>  cm, while the smallest linkage group  contained the smallest number of markers  and spanned  <dig>  cm. the average distance between adjacent markers went from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . the distribution of ssrs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the distribution of snps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . seven gaps with a distance > <dig> cm between adjacent markers were spread across c <dig>  and seven gaps with distances > <dig> cm between adjacent markers occurred on six of the linkage groups: c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> each with one gap, and c <dig> with two gaps . the results show that the marker loci were unevenly mapped in nine linkage groups .

ad, gap distance between adjacent markers.

distribution of markers along linkage groups
significant deviations from the random distribution of markers were observed for marker intervals of  <dig> cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig> cm,  <dig> cm,  <dig> cm, and  <dig> cm. for a  <dig> cm interval, the significant deviation  was shown in figure
 <dig>  indicating that the markers were not randomly distributed in the brassica oleracea linkage groups. marker distribution for other intervals  also showed clustering of markers  along linkage groups. the independent analysis for testing the random distribution of ssr  and snp  markers indicated deviations from the random distribution.

the distance between two adjacent markers on the linkage groups varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between two adjacent markers . this distance distribution reveals a strong skewness , further indicating the non-random distribution of the markers along the linkage groups . among the  <dig>  intervals on  <dig> different linkage groups,  <dig> intervals were smaller than  <dig> cm , and  <dig> intervals were larger than  <dig> cm .

discussion
construction of high-density linkage map of b. oleracea
this study was concerned with the construction and comprehensive analysis of a high-density linkage map of b. oleracea. the map spans  <dig>  cm and is divided into nine linkage groups corresponding to the number of b. oleracea chromosomes, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. significantly, of the  <dig>  mapped markers,  <dig>   were sequence-based markers for b. oleracea.

the main purpose of constructing the map was to anchor and orient scaffolds onto the pseudochromosomes for the b. oleracea sequencing project. approximately 83% of the b. oleracea genome has been assembled using this high-density linkage map, and the results will be published in a future paper.

ideally the average distance between adjacent markers should be short and the markers should be evenly distributed throughout the genome. however, many of the markers on the linkage maps of tomato
 <cit> , barley
 <cit>  and maize
 <cit>  have been reported to be clustered. similarly, the markers on the b. oleracea genetic linkage map created in the present study are not evenly distributed.

ssrs are efficient anchor markers with high levels of polymorphism and single locations. they can be used to integrate different linkage maps and chromosomes. ssrs also make good probes for fluorescent situ hybridization  to integrate genetic and cytogenetic maps.

the main reason why the distribution of molecular markers is uneven is that some chromosomal regions in the parental lines lack polymorphisms. therefore, the development of mapping populations from different crosses and the use of new molecular markers, including snps and ssrs are effective ways to fill in gaps between makers to obtain saturated genetic maps.

comparison with published maps of b. oleracea
a total of  <dig> different genetic linkage maps of b. oleracea have been constructed . the first substantial linkage map based on an f <dig> cross between cabbage and broccoli, contained a total of  <dig> rflp markers and covered  <dig> cm
 <cit> . since then, the construction of molecular genetic linkage maps of brassica has developed rapidly. kianian and quiros
 <cit>  developed a map from an f <dig> that consisted of  <dig> rflp and  <dig> isozyme markers covering over  <dig> cm in  <dig> linkage groups. a linkage map consisting of  <dig> rflp markers with a total distance of  <dig> cm was constructed from an f <dig> cross between cabbage and broccoli
 <cit> . a b oleracea genetic map consisting of  <dig> molecular markers and one phenotypic marker distributed along nine linkage groups  with a total distance of  <dig>  cm and a marker density of  <dig>  cm/marker has also been published
 <cit> . the highest density brassica oleracea linkage map developed by gao et al.
 <cit>  comprised of  <dig>  markers. although this linkage map contained more markers than ours, most markers on their map were srap markers, which could not be transferred to other linkage map easily. the map constructed in this study comprised of markers which were ssr and snp markers that were easy to transfer to other linkage maps. 

the map produced in the present study contains the second largest number of transferable markers out of the  <dig> genetic linkage maps constructed thus far. the average genetic and physical intervals, however, are the shortest at  <dig>  cm and  <dig> kb per marker, and the number of transferable markers on the map is more than on all the previously published genetic maps. in addition, because the mapping population was a doubled haploid  produced from a cross between cabbage varieties the map will enhance the efficiency of cabbage breeding, compared to the other maps that were produced from crosses between different varieties such as cabbage and broccoli, and cauliflower and kale. therefore, this newly constructed map is not only important for research on the related characteristics of cabbage, but it will also contribute to the exchange of materials between laboratories and successive research in the future.

the reason for segregation distortion
segregation distortion is defined as the frequencies of genotypes in offspring that do not conform to those predicted by the classical mendel's law of inheritance. genetic mapping studies have demonstrated that this phenomenon occurs in many species, including maize
 <cit> , rice
 <cit>  and cherimoya
 <cit> ; however, the cause of this marker skewing is still debated.

skewed segregation of markers affects recombination values between markers which results in decreased accuracy of genetic maps and qtl mapping. the extent of skewness is related to the type of markers, the mapping population that was used, and the genetic relationships of the parents. in general, the skewness of co-dominant markers is less than dominant ones
 <cit> . the skewed segregation ratio of recombinant inbred lines is higher than backcross populations  and doubled haploid populations . the f <dig> population has the lowest marker skewness. a low frequency of skewness implies that the parental genetic relationship is close
 <cit> .

lyttle
 <cit>  suggested that skewed segregation was one of the engines of evolutionary processes, and that it may be related to the selection of gametophytes or sporophytes. faure
 <cit>  proposed many possible reasons for this phenomenon:  the loci on chromosomes are not homologous or translocated, which impacts negatively on synapses in meiosis;  different selectivities of gametophyte and sporophyte;  interactions between adjacent and linked loci; and  non-homologous recombination, gene conversion, and/or transposon from parents
 <cit> . environmental factors and perhaps other factors may also have to be considered.

skewed markers may be distributed among linkage groups either as individuals or as clusters. the individually segregated loci occur because of the emergence of systematic segregation
 <cit>  and are caused by point mutations. often distorted markers are linked in clusters, suggesting that there has been selective process of gametophytes or sporophytes
 <cit> .

in the current study, we identified  <dig> distorted regions on linkage groups c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  the sdrs were distributed as clusters, which is similar to the results of studies on other crops. the highest numbers of distorted sdr markers were found near the middle of the linkage groups, and the numbers gradually reduced towards the ends. in summary, studies of the linkage maps of rice, maize and other crops have shown that sdr loci may be linked to sterility genes and pollen suppressed genes which, in turn, affects the selection of partial gametophytes or sporophytes. it is important to note that while the phenomenon of skewed segregation was observed in b. oleracea, it requires further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the high-density linkage map of b. oleracea l. var. capitata was constructed with the aim of using it to anchor the assembled scaffolds to pseudochromosomes, and the assembly of the cabbage genome sequence  has been completed using this map. the map will also provide a useful resource for positional cloning, molecular breeding, and integration of information of genes and traits in b. oleracea.
