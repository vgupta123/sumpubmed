BACKGROUND
the genus ochroconis comprises oligotrophic species found in litter, soil and moist surfaces that have also been associated with occasional opportunistic infections in humans and animals  <cit> . macroscopically, these fungi are characterised by red-brown exudates in the culture medium. under microscopic examination, rhexolytically liberated conidia with open denticles and frills remaining on the conidial bases are commonly observed  <cit> . their taxonomic classification has been problematic. the fungi have been suggested to be grouped within chaetothyriales  <cit>  or as unclassified anamorphic ascomycetes  <cit> . machouart et al.  <cit> , however, used multigene  phylogenetic analysis to classify the fungi in the family sympoventuriaceae of class dothideomycetes. from the original four species, o. gallopava, o. constricta, o. humicola and o. tshawytschae  <cit> , the genus has expanded to include at least  <dig> species  <cit> . following intensive revision based on molecular, morphological and ecological comparisons, a new genus verruconis was proposed for the thermophilic oligotrophs o. gallopava, o. verruculosa and o. calidifluminalis  <cit> . the remaining ochroconis species are mesophilic saprobes, causing infections mainly in cold-blooded animals such as fish and frogs, but also occasionally in warm-blooded vertebrates including humans  <cit> . two of the species, o. lascauxensis and o. anomala had been isolated from lascaux cave, causing black stains on cave sediments, walls and paintings  <cit> . a strain of o. constricta from soil was reported to have keratinolytic activity  <cit> .

o. mirabilis has been previously identified as o. constricta, a species that has been isolated mostly from water , domestic environments , and human skin and nails  <cit> . we previously isolated five strains of o. constricta   <cit> . the genome of um  <dig> was sequenced, and preliminary observations on its genome were reported  <cit> . in this study, um  <dig> was re-identified as o. mirabilis based on phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses. moreover, we analysed its genome content in-depth. additional studies on carbohydrate enzymes, lipases, secondary metabolite backbone genes, mating type genes, comparative gene families and protein families expansion and contraction are presented in this study. these genomic features are possibly associated with the ability of the species to thrive in different environments.

RESULTS
morphological and molecular identification
microscopic examination revealed rhexolytic liberation of conidia, unbranched, cylindrical to acicular conidiophores; smooth-walled to verruculose, subhyaline to pale brown coloured conidia that were constricted at the septum; and the presence of anastomosing hyphae as described by samerpitak et al.  <cit>  . the colony of um  <dig> was grey brown and raised in the middle with red-brown colour in the circumference and the medium surrounding the colony. the reverse side of the colony was dark brown in colour and did not grow into the agar.fig.  <dig> macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of um  <dig>  culture characteristics of um  <dig>  from the front and  from the reverse on sda. microscopic characteristics of the  conidia and  i) anastomosing hyphae. bars 20 μm



um  <dig> was previously identified as o. constricta. here, we re-examined its identity using an its-based phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic analysis showed um  <dig> clustering with um  <dig> within the o. mirabilis cluster .fig.  <dig> its-based phylogenetic tree of species from the genus ochroconis. ochroconis spp. its-based phylogenetic tree generated by bayesian analysis based on  <dig> sampling frequency for a total of  <dig>  generations. scolecobasidium excentricum and sympoventuria capensis were used as outgroup strains. um  <dig> was resolved as o. mirabilis. the accession number for um  <dig> its sequence is kf639587



we constructed a phylogenomic tree with protein sequences from  <dig> fungal genomes from different classes, including two leotiomycetes, two sodariomycetes, five eurotiomycetes, six dothideomycetes and two saccharomycetes as outgroups . a total of  <dig>  proteins were clustered into  <dig>  orthologous clusters with  <dig> single-copy orthologues identified. the phylogenomic tree is consistent with that in a previous study  <cit>  which showed o. mirabilis um  <dig> within class dothideomycetes.fig.  <dig> phylogenomic tree of um  <dig> and other fungi. the phylogenomic tree was constructed using  <dig> publicly available fungal genomes from class eurotiomycetes, sordariomycetes and dothidemycetes with two fungal genomes from class saccharomycetes as outgroup. the tree was generated using bayesian analysis. um  <dig> was found clustered within class dothideomycetes



genome assembly, gene models and transposable elements
the 500-bp and 5-kb insert libraries generated  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig> , <dig> reads  <cit> , respectively using illumina hiseq  <dig>  the sequencing coverage for the combined sequenced reads was 80-fold . the reads were assembled into  <dig> contigs, with  <dig> contigs having size ≥200 bp. the contigs were then scaffolded into  <dig> scaffolds based on the paired-end information from both libraries. the assembly size of um  <dig> was ~ <dig>  mb, with a scaffold n <dig> of  <dig> ,353 bp. the assembled genome had a gc content of  <dig>  %. a total of  <dig>  genes were predicted using genemark-es version  <dig> e  <cit> , with an average gene length of 1411 bp. a total of  <dig> rrnas and  <dig> trnas were predicted in the genome.table  <dig> sequencing statistics and genome features of um 578



there were  <dig> class i retrotransposons and  <dig> class ii dna transposons encompassing  <dig>  % of the assembled genome . gypsy and copia from the class i retrotransposons and tc1-mariner from the class ii dna transposons are reported to be the most abundant transposable elements in fungal genomes  <cit> . as seen in table  <dig>  gypsy type forms the highest number of transposable elements in um  <dig>  followed by dde_ <dig> and ty1_copia while helitronorf type forms the largest number in class ii transposons. although the repetitive elements described here may not represent all transposable elements in the genome of this isolate owing to the limitation of illumina technology  <cit> , they provide an idea of the type of transposable elements identified in this genome. the composition and organisation of repetitive elements in the genome enable the delineation of the best strategy for sequencing the whole genome  <cit> .table  <dig> transposable elements predicted in um 578



gene annotation
in the functional categorisation using eukaryotic orthologous group ,  <dig> predicted genes were redundantly assigned into kog classifications , of which,  <dig> genes were annotated as poorly characterised proteins,  <dig> assignments were in the category of information storage and processing,  <dig> in the cellular processes and signalling category and  <dig> in the metabolism category. of the eight kog classifications in the metabolism category,  <dig> genes were annotated to the secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism ,  <dig> genes annotated to lipid transport and metabolism  and  <dig> genes annotated to energy production and conversion , composing the top three classifications in this category. in class q, there were  <dig> genes annotated as flavin-containing monooxygenase. flavin-containing monooxygenases are widely found in many organisms and have multiple biological functions. these enzymes in um  <dig> might play a role in the biodegradation of environmental aromatic compounds, detoxification of drugs and antibiotics, and siderophore biosynthesis  <cit> , processes which provide a survival advantage in the adverse environment.fig.  <dig> kog, kegg and go classifications of predicted genes in o. mirabilis um  <dig>  a distribution of kog classes. i) information storage and processing caterory: j, translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; a, rna processing and modification; k, transcription; l, replication, recombination and repair and b, chromatin structure and dynamics. ii) cellular processes and signalling category: d, cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning; y, nuclear structure; v, defense mechanisms; t, signal transduction mechanisms; m, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; n, cell motility; z, cytoskeleton; w, extracellular structures; u, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport and o, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones. iii) metabolism category: c, energy production and conversion; g, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; e, amino acid transport and metabolism; f, nucleotide transport and metabolism; h, coenzyme transport and metabolism; i, lipid transport and metabolism; p, inorganic ion transport and metabolism and q, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism. iv) poorly characterised category: r, general function prediction only and s, function unknown. b kegg metabolic pathway distribution. c distribution of go annotations



of the  <dig> predicted genes annotated in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway maps, the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism is the fourth highest metabolic pathway mapped with predicted genes from this species , after carbohydrate metabolism , amino acid metabolism  and lipid metabolism  . from the styrene degradation map , three enzymes were mapped in the degradation of z-phenylacetaldoxime. the enzymes were nitrilase , nitrile hydratase  and amidase  but no phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase . to further inspect the capability of um  <dig> in z-phenylacetaldoxime degradation, a gene annotated as phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase was identified. the gene, um578_ <dig> encodes an enzyme belonging to the haem-containing dehydratase family  that has 31 % similarity to the bacillus sp. oxb- <dig> phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase oxd   <cit>  . interestingly, a nitrilase  encoding gene is located adjacent to the oxd gene in the genome as observed previously in fusarium graminearum  <cit> , bacillus sp. oxb- <dig>  <cit>  and pseudomonas syringae  <cit>  . however, the gene arrangement in um  <dig> is different from that in those reported species, and the predicted regulatory protein is missing in um  <dig> 

furthermore, we found that um  <dig> might be able to degrade cyanamide in the atrazine degradation pathway . cyanamide is a reactive substance that seldom occurs in nature and remains undegradable for a long time in an abiotic medium. it is used as a nitrogen fertiliser in the form of calcium salt and hydrogen cyanamide. cyanamide was also reported to be phytotoxic, bactericidal and fungicidal  <cit> . in this genome, two genes were identified to encode cyanamide hydratase  and urease , respectively and are shown to be expressed . cyanamide hydratase catalyses the hydrolysis of cyanamide to urea while urease converts the urea to ammonium. the cyanamide hydratase from the fungus myrothecium verrucaria is well characterised and used in transgenic plants to act as a biocontrol of phytopathogens  <cit> . moreover, the end product, urea, is a useful compound that acts as a plant fertiliser to facilitate plant growth  <cit> . the presence of genes involved in biodegradation shows the adaptation of the fungus towards the occurrence of non-natural compounds in the environment.

in the functional classification of um  <dig> genome based on gene ontology ,  <dig> of  <dig>  predicted genes were given a go assignment. of these genes,  <dig>  were redundantly assigned into cellular component ontology,  <dig>  into molecular function ontology and  <dig>  into biological process ontology . most of the genes were annotated to cell  and organelle  in the cellular component ontology, binding activity  and catalytic activity  in the molecular function ontology, and cellular process  and metabolic process  in the biological process ontology. as these are the fundamental components and processes for the viability of an organism, it is not surprising that these genes encompass a large portion of the genome.

carbohydrate metabolism
heterotrophic fungi harbour carbohydrate active enzymes  to degrade complex carbohydrates from organic matters for nutrient supply. we identified  <dig> cazyme catalytic domains in um  <dig>  the modules comprise  <dig> domains belonging to auxiliary activities,  <dig> to carbohydrate-binding modules ,  <dig> to carbohydrate esterases ,  <dig> to glycoside hydrolases ,  <dig> to glycosyltransferases  and five to polysaccharide lyases  . based on substrates specificity, um  <dig> has a very small number of cazymes involved in cellulose degradation but a high number of cazymes involved in hemicellulose degradation , indicating a possible least preference towards cellulosic materials compared to compounds high in hemicellulose. it also harbours a larger number of cazyme modules as compared to some necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic and saprophytic fungi . however, it contains less cazyme modules involved in plant cell wall degradation . the large number of enzymes involved in hemicellulose degradation present in um  <dig> indicates a possible preference of this fungus towards soft plant tissues such as fruits  <cit> . some modules such as cellobiohydrolase  involved in cellulose degradation, endo-β- <dig> -xylanase , arabinofuranosidase  and β- <dig> -galactanase  involved in xylan degradation and, pectin methylesterase  and rhamnogalacturonan lyase  involved in pectin degradation were absent in this isolate. this might lead to least efficiency in the degradation of plant cell walls. among the  <dig> isolates identified as o. mirabilis in the study by samerpitak et al.  <cit> , only a few were isolated from plants.fig.  <dig> comparison of cazyme modules in um  <dig> and other fungi with different lifestyles. um  <dig> has a higher number of predicted cazyme modules compared to some of the fungi in different lifestyles. cbm, carbohydrate-binding modules; ce, carbohydrate esterases; gh, glycoside hydrolases; gt, glycosyltransferases; pl, polysaccharide lyases. 1data obtained from zhao et al.  <cit> ; 2data obtained from ohm et al.  <cit>

peptidases
using merops analysis, we identified  <dig> peptidases in um  <dig>  of which,  <dig> were secreted enzymes. the highest numbers were from the metallopeptidase family , and the serine peptidase family  .

as o. mirabilis are isolated from human skin lesions and nails  <cit> , we looked for genes encoding keratin degradation proteases and identified seven that are secreted proteases similar to the keratin-associated degradation proteases of the dermatophyte trichophyton rubrum. these peptidases belong to the families m14a, s <dig>  m <dig> and s <dig>  one gene  encoding a secreted metallocarboxypeptidase from the family m14a, shows  <dig> and 41 % identity to m14a peptidase of t. rubrum   <cit>  and metarhizium anisopliae   <cit> , respectively. this peptidase contains conserved zinc-binding, substrate binding, catalytic sites and cysteine residues . a total of six secreted carboxypeptidase s <dig> family were predicted. of the putative s <dig> peptidases, um578_ <dig> has the best match to the characterised t. rubrum carboxypeptidase scpa   <cit>  . multiple sequence alignment showed the conserved active sites in um 578_ <dig>  with t. rubrum scpa and aspergillus fumigatus cp <dig> , ortholog of scpa . in addition, another s <dig> peptidase, um578_ <dig> was identified similar to t. rubrum carboxypeptidase y    <cit>  with 66 % identity.

furthermore, two genes encoding leucine aminopeptidase  from the m <dig> family, um578_ <dig> and um578_ <dig> exhibited  <dig> and 54 % identity to t. rubrum lap <dig>   <cit>  and lap <dig>   <cit> , respectively. multiple sequence alignment was conducted with lap <dig> and lap <dig> from t. rubrum and a. fumigatus that have been reported to have the same hydrolytic activity  <cit>  . both genes have the same catalytic sites as reported. the consensus binding sites for the first and second zn2+ ion in um578_ <dig> are his <dig> and asp <dig> and, glu <dig> and his <dig> respectively. asp <dig> is the predicted residue bridging the two zn2+ ions. the um578_ <dig> first zn2+ ion binding site was predicted at his <dig> and asp <dig>  and the second zn2+ ion binding site was predicted at glu <dig> and his <dig>  the bridging residue is at asp <dig>  lastly, we also identified two genes encoding putative dipeptidyl peptidase iv  and dppv from family s <dig>  um578_ <dig> shares  <dig> and 53 % identity to dppiv secreted by t. rubrum   <cit>  and a. fumigatus   <cit> , respectively. another gene, um578_ <dig> shares  <dig> and 52 % identity to dppv of the t. rubrum   <cit>  and a. fumigatus   <cit> , respectively. both genes have the same conserved catalytic sites as previously reported  <cit>  . the two predicted peptidases have the catalytic triad ser  <dig>  asp <dig>  his <dig> and ser  <dig>  asp <dig>  his <dig> 

in addition, we identified a gene  encoding a putative sulphite efflux pump, ssu <dig> . ssu <dig> is involved in the excretion of sulphite to digest keratin by reducing the disulphide bridges in the cornified cell layers  <cit> . um578_ <dig> has ten membrane-spanning helixes and hydrophilic n- and c- termini, which is consistent with the previous report by léchenne et al.  <cit>  .

it has been hypothesised that the presence of multiple endoproteases of subtilisins  and fungalysins  enable dermatophytes to invade hosts as they share similar sets of peptidases with non-dermatophytes . we compared the abundance of peptidases found in keratinophilic dermatophytes and in um  <dig> . however, we could not find any similar abundance pattern of peptidase families between um  <dig> and the dermatophytes. from the gene families analysis conducted with  <dig> fungal genomes , we identified shared genes among t. rubrum, t. verrucosum and um  <dig>  that are not involved in keratin degradation. most of the shared genes encode hypothetical proteins while some genes encode the atpase family associated with various cellular activities, methyltransferase, beta-lactamase, alpha/beta hydrolase, glyoxalase-like, nad-dependent epimerase and dna binding proteins. thus, the secreted proteases in um  <dig> do not seem to play a role in the survival of o. mirabilis in human skin and nails.

peptidases from families m10a, m12a and s <dig> were found to be involved in the degradation of collagen and extracellular matrix . in the um  <dig> genome, we predicted four peptidases belonging to the m10a family , nine zinc metallopeptidases from the astacin family  and  <dig> prolyl aminopeptidases . among the four m10a peptidases, three  are similar to myroilysin that was reported to have elastinolytic activity and synergistic effect in collagen degradation  <cit> . the matrix metallopeptidase from candida albicans was reported to degrade fibronectin and type i collagen completely as well as partially degrade laminin and type iv collagen  <cit> . astacin family peptidases  have diverse functions ranging from digestion of food to the processing of extracellular matrix components  <cit> . prolyl aminopeptidases from family s <dig> free the n-terminal residue from a peptide with a preference towards proline, thus, providing an advantage for the fungus to utilise proline-rich substrates such as collagen  <cit> . as the domestic environment has been reported as a reservoir for fungi causing human infections  <cit>  and the infection was suggested to occur via moisturised human skin after a shower  <cit> , these peptidases are likely to provide the nutrient source for o. mirabilis causing skin infections as described for fungi inhabiting moist indoor reservoirs.

lipase activity
lipases belong to many different protein families that do not show sequence similarity but have the same architecture. some of these enzymes share similar fold and catalytic machinery  <cit> . the ubiquitous skin-inhabiting fungus, malassezia globosa is unable to synthesise fatty acids but has multiple lipases that enable it to assimilate lipids from the skin of its human host  <cit> . we compared putative lipases in um  <dig> with those in several skin-inhabiting and non-skin inhabiting fungi  and found the percentage of predicted lipase genes in um  <dig>  to be comparable to that predicted in candida albicans , an opportunistic skin coloniser . the result suggests the possibility of um  <dig> employing these lipases for survival on the skin.table  <dig> summary of predicted lipases for each fungus in the analysis

secondary metabolites
to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on secondary metabolites produced by ochroconis. in um  <dig>  we identified a total of  <dig> secondary metabolite backbone genes comprising five polyketide synthases , one pks-like, three nonribosomal peptide synthases , four nrps-like and four dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases . polyketides are secondary metabolites that are formed from small carbon precursor acids whose successive condensation is catalysed by pks  <cit>  and comprise diverse natural products including antibiotics, pigments and mycotoxins.

melanin plays a significant role in resistance to abiotic stress and pathogenicity in dematiaceous fungi  <cit> . we found a potential pks  responsible for dhn-melanin biosynthesis. the gene is highly similar to the c. heterostrophus pks <dig>    <cit>  and the bipolaris oryzae pks <dig>    <cit> . um578_ <dig> contains five conserved domains comprised of ketosynthase , acyltransferase , acyl carrier protein  and thioesterase  domains in the order ks-at-acp-acp-te. the arrangement of the domains in the gene is the same as that in the pks <dig> and pks <dig> genes  <cit> . further inspection of the genes near um578_ <dig> revealed two genes annotated as transcription factor cmr <dig>  and tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase , located downstream to the pks gene . this strengthens our postulation that um578_ <dig> encodes a pks to synthesise dhn-melanin precursor as most of the genes involved in secondary metabolism are found in the clusters. moreover, the gene organisation and orientation of the um  <dig> melanin gene cluster is similar to those in c. heterostrophus and alternaria brassicicola  <cit> . another two enzymes that are essential in the dhn-melanin synthesis, scytalone dehydratase  and trihydroxynaphthalene reductase , were also found in the genome with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % identity to colletotrichum obiculare scytalone dehydratase  and trihydroxynaphthalene reductase , respectively.

on the other hand, putative aflatoxin /sterigmatocystin  biosynthesis genes were found in the um  <dig> genome . production of the toxic and carcinogenic af which was previously reported to be limited to aspergillus spp. has recently been reported in fusarium kyushuense  <cit> . st, the precursor of af is produced by diverse fungi  <cit> . genetic and biochemical studies suggested that the production of af, st together with another toxin dothistromin share common biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . dosthistromin is a red toxin that was first isolated from dothistroma septosporum. the disease caused by this toxin is known as dothistroma needle blight with broad spectrum toxicity against bacteria, fungi, plant and animal cells  <cit> . few fungi from the class dothideomycetes are also known to produce this toxin  <cit> . however, it should be noted that homologues of af/st biosynthetic genes are known to be involved in functions other than the production of red toxin. at this stage of knowledge, the exact role of these putative genes remains unknown.

trichothecenes are a family of mycotoxins consisting of more than  <dig> structurally related sesquiterpenoid metabolites. the toxins are potent protein synthesis inhibitors and apoptosis inducers in eukaryotic cells. trichothecenes are usually encountered as contaminants of food and animal feeds. the biosynthesis of trichothecenes involves a series of oxygenation, cyclisation and esterification reactions  <cit> . trichothecene-producing fungi are found in the order hypocreales, including stachybotrys, tricothecium, myrothecium, cephalosporium, fusarium and trichoderma. species from the genus stachybotrys have been reported as a significant contaminant of the indoor environment and have been associated with damp building-related illness, and the production of satratoxins, roridins and verrucarins types of trichothecenes  <cit> . the gene families analysis showed a significant number of fungal trichothecene efflux pump  domains in the um  <dig> genome . the function of tri <dig> has been postulated to be mainly responsible for self-protection of the fungus by exporting trichothecene outside the cells  <cit> . we identified the trichodiene synthase encoding gene  with  <dig>  % identity to the fusarium asiaticum trichodiene synthase . other genes encoding enzymes required for trichothecene biosynthesis were located in other regions of the genome . furthermore, the genes downstream to the putative trichodiene synthase are two proteins containing the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase domain and one protein containing the tri <dig> domain . based on these results, we hypothesised that the region of genomic dna that spans 8 kb from um578_ <dig> to um578_ <dig> is probably a trichothecene biosynthesis cluster for o. mirabilis. overall, these findings show that um  <dig> is likely to produce trichothecene.fig.  <dig> expansion of selected pfam families. predicted proteins were classified into pfam families and the expansion and contraction of families was analysed using cafe software. a pfam family of trichothecene efflux pump  . b pfam family of taurine catabolism dioxygenase taud/tfda . c pfam family of glutathione-s-transferase n-terminal  and c-terminal . d pfam family of rta1- like protein 



sexual reproduction
sexual reproduction enables the exchange of genetic material in eukaryotes to produce recombinants that are better adapted to the environment. in the genus ochroconis, the sexual-morph of the species is not well known, and the only species with known teleomorph is o. sexualis  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the involvement of o. mirabilis in sexual reproduction by looking for the presence of genes in mating and meiosis. we managed to identify several potential genes participating in the mating process, signalling, fruiting body development and meiosis . an alpha-box domain containing protein  with 43 % identity to fusarium oxysporum mat- <dig> gene   <cit>  involved in activation of alpha-specific genes was identified. um578_ <dig> was located adjacent to the genes encoding dna lyase apn <dig>  and cytochrome c oxidase vla cox <dig>  . the presence of these two genes in the mating type gene organisation has been reported in aspergillus, coccidioides, histoplasma and dermatophytes  <cit> . as only mat- <dig> gene was identified in um  <dig>  this strain could be a heterothallic fungus .

the homeodomain proteins  and, the alpha-box and hmg domain proteins are the two classes of proteins previously found in the mating type loci and are hypothesised as the ancestral fungal sex determinants. these two classes of sex determinants have undergone gene lost and acquisition in different lineages which resulted in the absence of homeodomain proteins in euascomycetes  <cit> . a hypothetical protein containing homeodomain was identified upstream of the um578_ <dig> gene . this would be the first euascomycete reported having a putative homeodomain protein in such proximity to the alpha-box. however, further functional validation is required to characterise these proteins. it should also be noted that only pheromone receptors but no pheromone genes were identified in the genome . as pheromone-receptor systems are essential in sexual reproduction  <cit> , there is a possibility that this fungal strain is not able to mate.

gene families analysis
the selection of fungal genomes for comparative analysis is based on different lifestyles of the fungal candidates and the characteristics of o. mirabilis  <cit>  . a total of  <dig>  gene families were identified using orthomcl with  <dig> families conserved in all  <dig> fungal genomes. there are  <dig> families conserved in dothideomycetes and  <dig> um  <dig> specific gene families in this study set. among those um  <dig> specific gene families, the f-box domain containing genes formed the largest family , followed by the genes containing heterokaryon incompatibility domain  .

in the pfam family expansion and contraction analysis,  <dig> families were shown to have undergone changes , with  <dig> families significantly expanded and  <dig> families contracted in um  <dig> . the domains enriched in um  <dig> can be functionally categorised into proteins involved in transport functions, protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, oxidoreductase activity and hydrolysis functions. in contrast, the contracted families are domains encoding for pks backbone enzymes, glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  and lysm domain . some of the expanded families are also present in gene families only observed in um  <dig> such as taurine catabolism dioxygenase taud/tdfa, trichothecene efflux pump , btb/poz domain, antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase, and alpha/beta hydrolase fold.

expansion of genes containing the taurine catabolism dioxygenase taud/tdfa domain was found with an increase from  <dig> to  <dig> copies . four taud/tdfa genes were found in a um  <dig> specific gene family. these genes encode alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase function in the catalysis of taurine to sulfite and aminoacetyldehyde  <cit> . taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid present in high concentrations in mammals, marine invertebrates, fish and marine algae. taurine plays a role in physiological functions in these organisms such as antioxidation, cell cytotoxicity reduction, osmoregulation and membrane stabilisation  <cit> . some microorganisms utilise taurine as a sulfur source under sulfate starvation  <cit>  and as a source for growth  <cit> . the high number of taud genes identified suggests the utilisation of taurine as a nutrient source by o. mirabilis.

recently, a dothideomycetes, acidomyces richmondensis was found able to synthesise and degrade taurine in a biofilm study. taurine was then suggested to act as a compatible solute protecting the microbes from osmotic stress  <cit> . kegg annotations showed that um  <dig> might produce taurine . two genes  were mapped to the glutamate decarboxylase  in the taurine metabolism pathway. in addition, we managed to identify a gene  annotated as cysteine lyase that is  <dig>  % identical to saccharomyces pombe cysteine lyase . this completes the taurine metabolism pathway. thus, o. mirabilis that is frequently isolated from immensely low water availability environments such as coastal hypersaline and bathroom surfaces  <cit> , might also acquire taurine in osmoregulation.fig.  <dig> kegg map of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. genes annotated via kegg are shaded. cysteine dioxygenase  was not annotated. however, the intermediate product, l-cysteate may be supplied via the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway



among other enriched pfam domains, the glutathione-s-transferase domains encode enzymes well-known to be responsible for detoxification by catalysing the conjugation of glutathione to xenobiotics, pesticides and drugs  <cit> . the pfam families encoding the n-terminal and c-terminal of glutathione-s-transferase increased from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> copies respectively . rta1-like protein that is also involved in detoxification has expanded from  <dig> to  <dig> copies . the rta1-like protein plays a role in resistance to 7-aminocholesterol and prevents toxicity by binding to toxic substances  <cit> . the inflation of these pfam families might contribute to the survival of o. mirabilis in domestic environments that are rich in xenobiotics and compounds toxic to the fungus.

CONCLUSIONS
our in silico genome analysis of o. mirabilis um  <dig> revealed potential genes that enable the fungus to thrive in hostile environments and the involvement of mycotoxin production. our analysis indicated that plant materials may not be the primary source of nutrient for this fungus. occasional disease in humans may be related to the presence of several putative peptidases involved in the extracellular matrix and collagen degradation together with the action of lipases. the isolate might be heterothallic, and the mating activity remains to be elucidated. the expansion of genes involved in the degradation of taurine and detoxification enables the fungus to survive in the man-made hostile environment. this in-depth analysis of um  <dig> genome provides a platform for more targeted functional studies in the future.
