BACKGROUND
a number of screens have been undertaken to identify proteins that interact with the tumour suppressor proteins p <dig> and rb. rbbp <dig> is one of the few proteins identified that has been shown to interact with both p <dig> and rb. three partial cdna's from the full length rbbp <dig> transcript were originally cloned and sequenced in different studies. rbq- <dig>  <cit> , corresponding to residues 150– <dig> of the human protein, and pact   <cit> , corresponding to residues 207– <dig>  were cloned on the basis of their ability to bind rb and p <dig> in both human and mouse cells. p2p-r  <cit> , corresponding to residues 199– <dig>  was cloned based on its recognition by two antibodies specific for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins . an alternatively spliced form omitting residues 651– <dig>  corresponding to exon  <dig> of the full length gene, has also been reported  <cit> . the hgmw-approved name retinoblastoma binding protein  <dig>  will be used for the complete protein in what follows. analysis of the rbbp <dig> locus on human 16p <dig>  suggests that three major transcripts of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb occur, by a combination of alternative splicing and alternative poly-adenylation. these transcripts encode proteins of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, which have been designated rbbp <dig> isoforms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively .

rbbp <dig> has been shown to suppress the binding of p <dig> to dna  <cit>  and to block the binding of the adenovirus e1a protein to rb  <cit> , suggesting that the interactions with both tumour suppressor proteins are biologically relevant. rbbp <dig> strongly localises to chromosomes during mitosis and to nuclear speckles, which are believed to be the main sites of activity for pre-mrna splicing and processing, during interphase  <cit> . over-expression has been shown to lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . the yeast homologue, mpe1p, forms part of the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor and is essential for the specific cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mrna  <cit> .

recently it has been reported that rbbp <dig> is strongly up-regulated in oesophageal cancer cells, and high levels of expression correlate with higher rates of proliferation in cultured oesophageal cancer cell and low survival rates in cancer patients  <cit> . cytotoxic t cells specific for rbbp6-derived peptides were able to lyse oesophageal cancer cells in culture, and to produce regression of oesophageal tumours in mice xenograft models.

despite its potential as an anti-cancer target and its apparently close association with transcription and the cell cycle, very little is known about the function of rbbp <dig>  in this report we describe the structure of the n-terminal domain of the human rbbp <dig> protein  and show that it adopts a ubiquitin-like fold. taken together with the presence of the ring finger domain in all rbbp <dig> homologues, this result suggests that rbbp <dig> may regulate pre-mrna processing proteins by covalently modifying them with a ubiquitin-like moiety. given that the dwnn domain is expressed as a single domain protein in the vertebrates as the isoform  <dig> form, the additional possibility exists that the dwnn domain itself plays the role of the ubiquitin-like modifier.

RESULTS
the rbbp <dig> protein family
an investigation using promoter-trapping technology led to the identification of a novel hamster gene homologous to the human cdna 21c <dig>   <cit> . this was completely sequenced and shown to be a  <dig>  kb cdna clone encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein . the corresponding gene was found to be located on human chromosome 16p <dig> , upstream of the previously identified rbbp6/pact/p2p-r gene. analysis of cdna sequences showed that the sequence coded for the previously unidentified n-terminus of the rbbp <dig> protein , which we have named the dwnn domain. a number of complete rbbp <dig> cdna clones have now been sequenced  and these confirm the presence of three mrna transcripts of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, which occur as the result of a combination of alternative splicing and alternative poly-adenylation. the three transcripts encode proteins of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, which have been designated rbbp <dig> isoforms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. 

extensive blast searches  <cit>  against all available sequence data showed that the dwnn domain is found only at the n-terminus of the rbbp <dig> family of proteins. all of the identified rbbp <dig> homologues include the dwnn domain, a cchc zinc finger and a ring finger domain and are found as single copy genes in all complete eukaryotic genomes analysed to date . the three domain form is found in plants, protozoa, fungi and microsporidia, although it is much reduced in size in the single-celled parasite encephalitozoon cuniculi, which has a highly compacted genome and has been identified as being close to the "minimal" eukaryotic organism  <cit> . the rbbp <dig> homologues in vertebrates and insects are longer and include additional domains, including the rb-binding and p53-binding domains identified previously  <cit> . however, there are no homologous sequences present in prokaryotes.

the zinc finger is of the cchc type, also known as a "zinc knuckle"  <cit> , which occurs in a number of mrna-associated proteins, including the splicing factors slu <dig>  h9g <dig> and hsf <dig>  <cit> . the zinc knuckle from slu <dig> has been shown to play an active role in preventing slu <dig> from shuttling between the nucleus and the cytosol during mrna processing  <cit> . ring fingers are typically found in e3-ubiquitin ligases and have been shown to play an essential role in the conjugation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like moieties to protein substrates  <cit> . the rbbp <dig> ring domains have a c-x2-c-x11-c-c-x- -x2-c-x2-c-x12-c-x2-c rather than the classical c3hc <dig> consensus, which means they are either c4c <dig> or c3nc4-type ring fingers, depending on which residues are involved in coordinating the two zinc ions. c4c <dig> ring-like domains have been found in the transcription-associated proteins cnot <dig>  <cit>  and p <dig>  <cit> , and despite its non-typical consensus cnot <dig> has also been shown to have ubiquitin-ligase activity  <cit> . in addition to the conserved cysteines, rbbp <dig> ring domains share the wider set of conserved hydrophobic residues characteristic of u-box domains  <cit> . these are even stronger predictors of ubiquitin-conjugating function than the metal-chelating residues, since they are shared by a wider set of domains that adopt the same fold and participate in ubiquitination even in the absence of zinc ions.

in addition to the first three domains, human and mouse rbbp <dig> both contain long c-terminal extensions containing a proline-rich domain , an sr domain  and the rb-binding  and p53-binding domains  reported previously  <cit> . large c-terminal extensions also occur in the d. melanogaster and c. elegans homologues  although we have not been able to identify clear homologues of the sr, rb binding and p <dig> binding domains in these proteins, nor is it known whether they associate with homologues of p <dig> or rb.

an alignment of dwnn homologues from a range of different eukaryotes is shown in figure  <dig>  these sequences show no similarity to any other sequences in the database, indicating that the domain represents a novel protein motif that emerged soon after the emergence of eukaryotes. this conclusion is consistent with a comparative genomic study of proteins involved in rna metabolism  <cit>  showing that the appearance of splicing factors and rna binding domains such as zinc knuckles coincides with the development of pre-mrna splicing soon after the emergence of eukaryotes. this is in contrast to proteins involved in basic transcription and translation, many of which share common ancestors which pre-date the divergence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. in the light of the low copy number at which the rbbp <dig> gene appears, it is perhaps interesting that many proteins involved in rna metabolism are also present at low copy number in the genomes of many organisms, despite the high level of conservation and the essential function they fulfil in the organism  <cit> .

in addition to forming part of the full-length rbbp <dig> protein, the dwnn domain is also expressed in vertebrates as a small protein of 118– <dig> residues  containing a dwnn domain and a short c-terminal tail. preliminary analysis suggests that the short form is present in all vertebrates but not in invertebrates, plants or fungi. the sequence from residues 82– <dig> in human is poorly conserved across species, suggesting that it may be un-structured in vivo; this conclusion is supported by our observation that this part of the protein is sensitive to proteolysis when expressed recombinantly in bacteria, whereas the dwnn domain  is highly stable.

determination of the structure of the dwnn domain
residues 1– <dig> of human rbbp <dig>  corresponding to the dwnn domain, were expressed recombinantly in e. coli and the structure determined using heteronuclear nmr. assignment of 99% of all non-labile protons and 90% of 13c and 15n resonances was achieved using standard triple resonance protocols . a total of  <dig> noe-derived distance restraints were used in the structure calculation, made up of  <dig> short range,  <dig> medium range and  <dig> long range restraints. structural data used in the calculation are summarised in figure  <dig>  a backbone superposition of the  <dig> lowest-energy conformers is shown in figure 4a. the average of the pair-wise root mean square deviations for residues 2– <dig> is  <dig>  Å for all backbone heavy atoms and  <dig>  Å for all heavy atoms respectively. regions of secondary structure were identified in molmol  <cit>  using the built-in algorithm. the number of restraints per residue and the associated local rmsd across the family of structures are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, regions of secondary structure correspond to large numbers of long-range noe's and small rmsd's. the final family of structures have no distance-restraint violations greater than  <dig>  Å, no dihedral angle violations greater than 5° and conform well to ideal covalent geometry as determined using the programmes whatcheck  <cit>  and procheck-nmr  <cit> . statistics relevant to the final family of structures are presented in table  <dig> 

comparison of the representative dwnn structure against the entire protein data base using the dali server  <cit>  reveals that it is most similar to human ubiquitin , and the n-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of isg <dig> , with z-scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the amino acid sequences of ubiquitin and dwnn are only 18% identical. a superposition of the backbone traces of the dwnn domain and ubiquitin is shown in figure 4c, along with a structural alignment of the primary sequences . the rmsd between the two structures over structurally equivalent regions  is  <dig>  Å.

the secondary structure consists of the elements β1-β2-β3-α-β4- β5- β6- β <dig>  with the α-helix packing against a five-stranded β-sheet made up of strands β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> in a ubiquitin-like β-grasp topology . unlike ubiquitin, dwnn contains an additional short section of anti-parallel β-sheet immediately prior to the α-helix , the evidence for which takes the form of strong αn noe's and large 3jnα coupling constants . the residues in this sheet have the highest number of long-range noe's, and the some of the lowest rmsd values , suggesting that it is one of the most stable regions of the whole protein. to our knowledge this additional β-sheet has not been seen in other ubiquitin-like proteins. the  <dig> helix immediately preceding the last β-strand in many ubiquitin-like proteins is not present in dwnn; figure 4d shows that the residues corresponding to this helix  are entirely absent in dwnn. in addition, based on our data we were not able to confirm the presence of a second  <dig> helix at the c-terminal end of the α-helix that is found in many ubiquitin-like proteins; however the loop preceding strand β <dig> is two residues longer than the corresponding loop in ubiquitin, so that there is no longer a requirement for a tight helical turn at this position. the high level of conservation of g <dig>  may be the consequence of the presence of the extra strand β <dig>  which requires the backbone to make a sharp kink at that position. hydrophobic residues f <dig>  l <dig>  i <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  i <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> and p <dig> make up the core of the protein, accounting for their high degree of conservation. the high level of conservation of non-hydrophobic residues y <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  y <dig> and r <dig> suggests a possible functional role for these residues.

discussion
in recent years a superfamily of ubiquitin-like domains has been identified  <cit> . this superfamily can be divided into the ubiquitin-like proteins , which consist solely of the ubiquitin-like domain, and ubiquitin domain proteins , which are larger proteins containing one or more ubiquitin-like domains. to our knowledge dwnn is the first example of a ubiquitin-like domain that is alternatively expressed both as a ubl and as a udp.

ubiquitin-like proteins typically share the c-terminal gg motif, which acts as a recognition motif for a protease that cleaves between the two glycines, initiating the process of conjugation. the occurrence of the gg motif in the structurally identical position in human and mouse dwnn domains  suggests that the domain may be involved in a similar process of conjugation, which we may call "dwnnylation". as in the case of ubiquitin, the gg lies outside of the structured region, as can be clearly seen in figure 5b. the absence of the gg in lower organisms is more difficult to rationalise; however preliminary est analysis suggests that organisms which do not contain the gg motif also do not contain the ubl form of the dwnn domain , so it is possible that the dwnn domain does not act as a covalent modifier in lower organisms. in the yeast protein hub <dig>  which has also been shown to be involved in pre-mrna splicing  <cit> , the role of the di-glycine motif is taken by a yy motif  <cit> . the structurally equivalent position in dwnn is taken by a highly conserved rr motif , which may therefore act as the activation signal.

ubiquitin contains four conserved lysine residues which are the sites of attachment of additional ubiquitin moieties, leading to the formation of poly-ubiquitin chains in some contexts  <cit> . k48-linked chains are recognised by the 26s proteosome, leading to degradation of the attached protein, whereas k6-linked and k63-linked chains are involved in a number of non-proteolytic processes, including stress response, dna repair and endocytosis  <cit> . k11-linked and k29-linked chains may also target substrates to the proteosome. in addition, mono-ubiquitination of proteins has been shown to be associated with receptor endocytosis, as well as the sorting and trafficking of proteins  <cit> . the dwnn domain contains no equivalent of k <dig> or k <dig> , although the equivalents of k <dig> and k <dig>  are highly, although not absolutely, conserved.

a number of lines of evidence suggest a role for rbbp <dig> in both mrna processing and ubiquitin-like protein modification. the close association between domains involved in rna metabolism and ubiquitination has previously been pointed out in a number of proteins, including mdm <dig>  <cit> . in yeast, the rbbp <dig> homologue mpe1p has been shown to be a component of the cpf complex  <cit> . mammalian rbbp <dig> has been identified as an sr protein on the basis of an sr domain   <cit> , the cchc rna binding domain, its localisation within nuclear speckles  <cit>  and its associate with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins   <cit> . sr proteins are involved in splicing, whereas hnrnps are thought to play a central role in organising the polyadenylation, splicing and export of mrna transcripts  <cit> . a number of sr proteins are known to interact directly with the c-terminal domain of the rna polymerase ii complex. a role for rbbp <dig> in mrna processing therefore seems highly probable. the presence of a ring finger domain in all eukaryotes, combined with the ubiquitin-like structure of the dwnn domain, makes it highly probable that rbbp <dig> also has ubiquitin-ligase activity, possibly involving modification of hnrnps with a ubiquitin-like moiety. several hnrnps have recently been shown to be sumoylated  <cit> , which resulted in a decreased affinity of the hnrnp for mrna.

furthermore, since p <dig> and rb have both been shown to bind to mammalian rbbp <dig>  it is possible that rbbp <dig> plays a role in the regulation of these two proteins similar to that played by mdm <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a possible model for the integration of the regulation of transcription, cell cycle control and apoptosis. given the fact that the dwnn domain can be independently expressed in vertebrates, an interesting possibility is that the function of rbbp <dig> is to dwnnylate other proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the dwnn domain represents a novel ubiquitin-like domain expressed in vertebrates both as a single domain protein and as the n-terminus of the rbbp <dig> family of tumour-suppressor associated proteins, making this the first example of a ubiquitin-like domain that is alternatively expressed both as a ubl and as a ubp.

members of the rbbp <dig> family are found at low copy number in all eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes, and the n-terminal three domains  are well conserved in all eukaryotes. longer forms are found in worms, flies and vertebrates, and the human rbbp <dig> contains domains known to interact with p <dig> and rb.

the similarity of dwnn domain to ubiquitin and the presence of the ring finger suggest that the dwnn domain may act as an ubiquitin-like modifier, possibly playing a role in the regulation of the splicing machinery. whether this involves the proteosome or some other ubiquitin-associated signalling such as regulation of membrane trafficking or protein sorting remains to be determined.

the functional basis for the association with p <dig> and rb is less clear. parallels have been drawn between the vertebrate long form of rbbp <dig> and mdm <dig>  <cit>  on the basis that both proteins contain ring domains and interact with p <dig> and rb. this would suggest a role for rbbp <dig> in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis and the integration of these processes with transcription and mrna processing. the presence of the three domain form in even the earliest eukaryotes would appear to support the conclusion that rna metabolism is the primary role of the protein, and that domains linking the protein to cell cycle regulation were added after the divergence of animals from plants and fungi.
