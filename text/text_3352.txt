BACKGROUND
autophagy is a conserved proteolytic mechanism by which cytoplasmic components, including damaged organelles, toxic protein aggregates and intracellular bacteria and viral pathogens are sequestered in a specialized double-membrane-bound autophagosome and delivered to the lysosome for bulk degradation and subsequent recycling  <cit> . it was well known that autophagy plays an important role not only in cell homeostasis, but also in innate immunity  <cit> . invading bacteria could be driven to the autophagosome–lysosome pathway for degradation  which protects the host against pathogen colonization  <cit> . it has been reported that autophagy is necessary for cells to restrict many pathogens such as mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> , group a streptococcus <cit> , salmonella enterica <cit> , francisella tularensis <cit>  and rickettsia conorii <cit> .

peritoneal dialysis -related peritonitis represents a serious complication and is the most important cause leading to the dropout in pd patients  <cit> . escherichia coli  is the most common organism caused single-germ enterobacterial peritonitis during pd  <cit> . it was noticed in recent years that a change in the virulence of e. coli peritonitis episodes resulted in high rates of treatment failures and even mortality  <cit> . lipopolysaccharide  is the biologically active constituent of endotoxins derived from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> , which is a potent inducer of autophagy in many cell lines, including macrophages  <cit> , human keratinocytes  <cit> , and myoblasts  <cit> . however, the induction of autophagy by lps in peritoneal mesothelial cells , which provides a nonadhesive and protective layer in the abdominal cavity against the invasion of foreign particles and injury  <cit> , and the role of autophagy in the elimination of e. coli from pmcs have not been studied yet. the objective of present study was to investigate the autophagy induced by lps in pmcs and its role in defense against e. coli. we were specifically interested in determining whether autophagy contributes to e.coli survival or death.

cell culture and viability studies
the simian virus  <dig> -immortalized human peritoneal mesothelial cell line  has been described previously  <cit> . hmrsv <dig> cells were cultured in dmem/f <dig> medium containing 10% fbs in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 95% o <dig> and 5% co <dig> at 37°c. the cell line was identified by phase contrast microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis. the effect of lps on the viability of cultured hmrsv <dig> cells was determined by mtt assay  <cit>  and flow cytometric analysis  <cit> .

immunofluorescence co-staining of ck- <dig> and vimentin
after fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, cells were permeabilized with  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  followed by incubating with 5% bsa in pbs for 60 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. then cells were stained with mouse anti-vimentin and mouse anti-cytokeratin  <dig> in pbs containing 5% bsa at 4°c overnight. cells were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. finally, coverslips were sealed with mounting medium. images were collected by an lsm  <dig> confocal immunofluorescence microscope .

measurement of autophagy by immunoblotting
equal amounts of protein were separated on 15% sds-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride  membranes. after blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in tris-buffered saline for 60 min at room temperature, the membranes were incubated at 4°c overnight with primary antibody. following incubation with secondary antibodies, the protein bands were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system. densitometric quantification of band intensities was determined using an image analysis program .

transfection of hmrsv <dig> cells with gfp-lc <dig> plasmid
hmrsv <dig> cells at 50-70% confluence were transiently transfected with 2 μg/ml gfp-lc <dig> plasmid dna per dish which was performed with lipofectamine  <dig>  after treatments as shown in the figure legends, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclei were labeled with dapi. autophagy was assessed by the formation of fluorescent autophagosome puncta. cells with more than  <dig> puncta indicated the gfp-lc <dig> positive cells. values were calculated from  <dig> cells/sample.

detection of autophagic vacuoles by mdc
treated cells were washed  <dig> times with pbs and then incubated with  <dig>  mm mdc in dmem/f <dig> at 37°c for 10 min. the cells were then immediately observed under a fluorescence confocal microscope equipped with the appropriate filters, where mdc exhibits autofluorescence at wavelengths of  <dig> and 525 nm for excitation and emission, respectively.

sirna gene silencing of beclin- <dig> or tlr4
knock down of beclin- <dig> or tlr <dig> in hmrsv <dig> cells was obtained by utilizing complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides to human beclin- <dig> or tlr <dig> . a non-targeting sirna pool was applied as a control . hmrsv <dig> cells were transfected with 1 μg of each duplex using lipofectamine  <dig> 

bacterial killing assay
the e. coli strain  was resuspended in saline without antibiotics prior to infection of hmrsv <dig> cells. hmrsv <dig> cells were plated at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per well and then treated as shown in the figure legends. e.coli was added at a moi of  <dig> and incubated at 37°c for 1 hour . then, hmrsv <dig> cells were washed with cold pbs to remove non-adherent bacteria and stop additional bacterial uptake. meanwhile, gentamicin  was added to limit the growth of extracellular bacteria. the cells were lysed at further 30 min, 60 min and 90 min respectively  with sterile distilled water. the number of viable bacteria  released from cells was detected by plating serial dilutions of bacteria on luria bertani  agar plates. bactericidal activity was analyzed by the percentage of remaining e.coli  which was was calculated as  ×  <dig> 

analysis of e. coli co-localization with autophagosomes by immunofluorescence
cells were infected with e. coli  bioparticles at a moi of 20: <dig> for 1 hour. following phagocytosis, cells were treated as shown in the figure legends. subsequently, the cells were washed  <dig> times with pbs and incubated with  <dig>  mm mdc in dmem/f <dig> at 37°c for 10 min. the cells were observed under a fluorescence confocal microscope equipped with the appropriate filters where mdc exhibits autofluorescence at wavelengths of  <dig> and 525 nm for excitation and emission, respectively.

transmission electron microscopy
cells were fixed at room temperature with former fixative . the samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, subsequently incubated with 1% uranyl acetate, then dehydrated through increasing concentrations of ethanol, and gradually infiltrated in lx- <dig> medium. thin sections of each sample were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then analyzed under a jem  <dig> transmission electron microscope .

statistical analysis
quantitative data were expressed as means ± standard deviations. the statistical differences in multiple groups were determined by one-way anova followed by student–neuman–keuls test. statistical differences between two groups were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test. all calculations were performed using spss  <dig>  statistical software . a value of p <  <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
characterization of human peritoneal mesothelial cell line  in culture
confluent hmrsv <dig> cells exhibited multipolar with a uniform cobblestone-like appearance under the phase contrast microscope. immunofluorescence analysis showed positive staining for cytokeratin  <dig> and vimentin , but negative staining for factor viii associated antigen and cd <dig> .

effects of lps on cell viability
following exposure of hmrsv <dig> cells to  <dig>  μg/ml lps for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 hours, or to the concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml lps for 24 hours, mtt assay showed no significant changes in cell viability . flow cytometric analysis also indicated that the rates of apoptosis in hmrsv <dig> cells did not change statistically after treatments of lps as described above .

autophagy in hmrsv <dig> cells was induced in response to lps stimulation
light chain  <dig>  exists in two forms, the 18 kda cytosolic form , and the 16 kda processed form  which is located on the autophagosomal membrane and a definitive marker of autophagosome formation  <cit> . beclin- <dig>  a protein factor that activates the class iii phosphoinositide 3-kinase  complex  <cit> , is another essential autophagy related protein for the eventual formation of the autophagosome  <cit> . following treatment of hmrsv <dig> cells with lps at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml for 12 hours, western blotting  demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in expression of beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii . apparently, after treatment with  <dig>  μg/ml lps, the amount of beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii in cells increased significantly . following treatment with  <dig>  μg/ml lps for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 hours, respectively, the expression of beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii increased in a time-dependent manner with a peak at 12 hours, and then declined . according to the results of wb and the viability assays, a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml lps and a time point of 12 hours were chosen for further experiments.

autophagosome formation could be confirmed further by fluorescence microscopic analysis of gfp-lc <dig> cells. hmrsv <dig> cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding gfp-lc <dig> and then incubated with  <dig>  μg/ml lps for 12 hours. it was observed that the transiently transfected cells exhibited characteristic fluorescent punctate gfp-lc <dig>  while green fluorescence of control cells remained cytosolic and diffuse .

monodansylcadaverine , a specific marker for autolysosomes  <cit> , was also applied to confirm the induction of autophagy in treated hmrsv <dig> cells. as shown in figure 2d, only basal levels of autophagy were observed in control cells, while increased number of vesicles as well as their size, which was indicated by the characteristic mdc staining, could be seen in the cells treated with lps .

transmission electron microscopy  demonstrated that after exposure of lps for 12 hours, the number of canonical double-membrane autophagosomes in hmrsv <dig> cells was significantly higher than that of control cells .

lps-induced autophagy enhanced intracellular bactericidal activity and the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes
the effect of activation of autophagy on e. coli viability was monitored by the percentage of remaining e.coli, which was calculated by direct scoring of bacterial colony-forming units  on bacteriological media  <cit> . the percentage of remaining e.coli was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in lps pretreated cells versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in control samples after 90 min incubation  , indicating that induction of autophagic pathways by lps in infected hmrsv <dig> cells could restrict the growth of e. coli.

to further investigate whether autophagy mediates intra-cellular antimicrobial activity in hmrsv <dig> cells, we analyzed the recruitment of lc3-ii to e. coli. following treatment with lps, cells were infected with fluorescent e. coli and autophagic vacuoles were labeled with mdc. the co-localization of e. coli with mdc-labeled autophagic vacuoles at 1 hour post-infection in hmrsv <dig> cells was quantified. compared to control cells, lps-activated hmrsv <dig> cells exhibited a markedly increased rate of e. coli co-localization with mdc-labeled autophagic vacuoles . as shown in figure 4d , the rate of e. coli co-localization with mdc-labeled vacuoles in lps-treated cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, while in control cells it was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % .

the effect of lps-induced autophagy on e. coli limitation was also verified by electron microscopy. the tem study showed that following stimulation of cells with lps, 76% of e. coli was engulfed in double-membrane-bound autophagosomes, while in control cells, only 9% of e. coli was harboured in autophagosomes . in contrast to lps-treated cells, 83% of e. coli in control cells was resided in single-membrane phagosomes .

inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors reduced lps-induced bactericidal activity and the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes
it was reported that the progression of autophagy was inhibited by the pi3k inhibitors, 3-methyladenine   <cit>  and wortmannin   <cit> . to demonstrate whether autophagy played a role in the bactericidal function of hmrsv <dig> cells, hmrsv <dig> cells were pre-incubated with 10 mm 3-ma or  <dig> nm wm for 1 hour, respectively, and then treated with lps for 12 hours. as shown in figure 5a and b, both 3-ma and wm pretreatment reduced the levels of beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii. in line with wb data, both 3-ma and wm markedly diminished the accumulation of mdc  and formation of gfp-lc <dig> puncta  in lps-treated cells.

to further investigate the role of autophagy in limiting e. coli growth, we compared the growth of e. coli in cells with or without pharmacological inhibitors. as depicted in figure 5d, lps-induced bactericidal activity in hmrsv <dig> cells was significantly abrogated by treatment with either 3-ma or wm.

we analyzed the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes in hmrsv <dig> cells pretreated with 3-ma or wm by confocal fluorescence microscopy. as expected, suppression of autophagy by 3-ma or wm also attenuated the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes . following the infection, the rate of co-localization of e. coli with mdc-labeled autophagosomes in lps-treated cells was approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , while in 3-ma or wm pretreated cells was approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively .

downregulation of autophagy by beclin- <dig> sirna reduced lps-induced bactericidal activity and the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes
to more specifically determine whether lps-induced antimicrobial activity was dependent on autophagy, short interfering rna  specific for beclin- <dig> was used to transfect the hmrsv <dig> cells and block autophagic responses. figure 7a shows that knockdown of beclin- <dig> effectively reduced expression of beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii protein. meanwhile, fewer autophagic vacuoles labeled by mdc were observed in hmrsv <dig> cells transfected with beclin- <dig> sirna .

we subsequently examined the bactericidal activity of the sirna-transfected cells in response to e. coli. compared with control cells incubated with lps alone, loss of beclin- <dig> in hmrsv <dig> cells markedly attenuated bactericidal activity induced by lps . in addition, we further used mdc staining to look for e. coli-targeted autophagosomes. consistent with the pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by 3-ma and wm, co-localization of e. coli with mdc-labeled autophagosomes decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  upon down-regulation of the beclin- <dig> gene in hmrsv <dig> cells .

lps induced autophagy via toll-like receptor  <dig>  dependent signaling in hmrsv <dig> cells
after incubation hmrsv <dig> cells with lps, a ligand for tlr <dig>  the expression of tlr <dig> increased in a dose-dependent and time-dependent way, as determined by wb . interestingly, tlr <dig> protein increased quickly at early stage , which was earlier than the increase of lc3-ii protein. it was also observed that expression levels of both beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii protein were significantly diminished in cells pretreated with 100 μg/ml polymyxin b  , an antibiotic binding to lipid a, which is the component of lps responsible for receptor binding and cellular signaling  <cit> . moreover, pmb pretreatment decreased gfp–lc <dig> aggregation as demonstrated by immunofluorescent microscopy .

in addition, knockdown of tlr <dig> with tlr <dig> sirna markedly decreased expression of beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii protein activated by lps incubation , which indicated that loss of tlr <dig> attenuated lps-induced autophagy. furthermore, as shown in figure 10d, tlr <dig> sirna impaired intracellular bactericidal activity induced by lps.

discussion
although aberrant autophagy is observed in many bacterial infectious diseases, the role of autophagy in pd-related peritonitis remains unknown. our study has investigated the role of autophagy in pmcs against intracellular e.coli. we demonstrated that lps could induce autophagy in hmrsv <dig> cells. lps enhanced the intracellular bactericidal activity of hmrsv <dig> cells and promoted the co-localization of e.coli  with autophagosomes. moreover, treatment with microtubule-disrupting agents such as 3-ma or wm or beclin- <dig> sirna, markedly attenuated the intracellular bactericidal activity of hmrsv <dig> cells and the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes induced by lps treatment. furthermore, knockdown of tlr <dig> vanished lps-induced autophagy and bactericidal activity. these data collectively suggest that autophagy activated by lps via tlr <dig> represents an innate defense mechanism for inhibiting intracellular e. coli replication.

autophagy is a process traditionally known to contribute to cellular cleaning via the removal of intracellular components in lysosomes  <cit> . recently, our colleagues reported that lps stimulation led to autophagy in cultured peritoneal mesothelial cells  <cit> . in keeping with their reports, our data revealed that lps induced accumulation of lc3-ii in a time- and dose-dependent manner in hmrsv <dig> cells, as indicated by an increased aggregation of gfp-lc <dig> puncta and a higher number of autophagosome-like mdc-labeled vacuoles. furthermore, hmrsv <dig> cells pretreated with 3-ma, wm or beclin- <dig> sirna displayed defective autophagy induction in response to lps. these results indicate that lps is a general stimulant of autophagic activity in pmcs. in addition, our study showed the viability of lps-treated cells had no significant difference compared to the control group. it has been demonstrated that exposure of pmcs to lps resulted first in autophagy and later, apoptosis  <cit> . apoptosis was only observed under higher concentrations of lps  exposure for 48 hours in hmrsv <dig> cells  <cit> . we could not detect apoptosis in hmrsv <dig> cells following the incubation with lower doses of lps  for shorter time periods  in present study, which was consistent with the previous report  <cit> . these observations indicated that incubation of 1 μg/ml lps for 24 hours was sufficient to induce autophagy but not apoptosis in hmrsv <dig> cells.

during infection, the ability of macroautophagy to remove large cytoplasmic structures with selectivity enables this pathway to be used to clear intracellular bacteria, parasites, and viruses   <cit> . several medically important human pathogens are degraded in vitro by xenophagy, including bacteria , viruses such as herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  and chikungunya virus, and parasites such as toxoplasma gondii <cit> . we therefore wondered whether induction of autophagy could affect the growth of e. coli in infected hmrsv <dig> cells. we found that stimulation of autophagy by lps in infected hmrsv <dig> cells could lead to degradation of e. coli within autophagosomes. furthermore, we observed that 3-ma or wm blockade of autophagy markedly attenuated the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes, leading to a defect in bactericidal activity. to more specifically determine whether autophagy affect the elimination of e.coli, beclin- <dig> sirna was employed to inhibit autophagy. as expected, fewer e.coli were targeted to the autophagosomes, and consequently more remaining e.coli were observed in cells deficient in beclin- <dig>  taken together, these data demonstrated that the effect of lps on bactericidal activity was dependent on the induction of autophagy.

lps is the ligand for tlr <dig>  and it also exerts multiple cellular effects by inducing signaling through tlr <dig>  <cit> . the activation of tlr <dig> by lps in peritoneal mesothelial cells might result in a massive influx of leukocytes in the peritoneal cavity, leading to the development of peritoneal dysfunction or peritoneal fibrosis  <cit> . it was demonstrated that tlr <dig> served as a previously unrecognized environmental sensor for autophagy  <cit> . therefore we further investigated whether tlr <dig> played roles in lps-induced autophagy in hmrsv <dig> cells. our results showed that the lps treatment increased the expression of tlr <dig> protein significantly in a dose-dependent and time-dependent way. moreover, the increased expression of tlr <dig> protein occurred earlier than the increase of lc3-ii protein. pretreated with pmb, a tlr <dig> inhibitor, displayed defective autophagy activation as indicated by the significantly decreased expression of both beclin- <dig> and lc3-ii protein as well as the decreased gfp–lc <dig> aggregation in cells. consistent with the pharmacological inhibition of tlr <dig>  knockdown of tlr <dig> with tlr <dig> sirna also led to reduction of autophagy-associated proteins. importantly, lps-induced bactericidal activity in hmrsv <dig> cells was significantly decreased after knockdown of tlr <dig>  to sum up, these results demonstrated that upregulation of autophagic response by lps was dependent on tlr <dig> signaling in hmrsv <dig> cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the present data revealed that lps-induced autophagy in hmrsv <dig> cells enhances both the co-localization of e. coli with autophagosomes and intracellular bactericidal activity. the upregulation of autophagic response induced by lps was dependent on the activation of tlr <dig> signaling. these results indicate that lps-induced autophagy is at least partially responsible for the growth restriction of e. coli in pmcs. developing strategies of selectively stimulating autophagy in infected cells may be considered as a new method for dealing with hard-to-eliminate e. coli. further and precise in vivo studies may shed light on how autophagy combats invasive pathogens inside the host cells.
