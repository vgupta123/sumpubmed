BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae, also referred to as group b streptococcus , is a gram-positive, β-hemolytic, chain-forming coccus. it has been recognized as one of the major causes of pneumonia and meningitis in neonates  <cit> , mastitis in cows  <cit> , and meningoencephalitis in fish  <cit> . since  <dig>  serious piscine gbs infections have occurred among tilapia farms in china, causing high mortality and resulting in considerable economic losses  <cit> . the isolate gd201008- <dig>  a highly virulent strain isolated from a moribund cultured tilapia in china, was identified and sequenced in our laboratory in  <dig>  <cit> . according to our comparative genomics analysis  <cit> , isolates from cultured tilapia in china have a very close genomic relationship with the human strain a <dig>  in fact, the genomic content of these isolates cannot be distinguished from that of a <dig>  s. agalactiae a <dig> was originally isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a neonate with meningitis in the usa  <cit> ; therefore, s. agalactiae infections among fish in china may represent a zoonotic hazard although further investigations are required to confirm this hypothesis.

as a consequence of the potential economic and ecological impacts on public health, many studies have been conducted on s. agalactiae with the aim of identifying virulence factors  <cit> , diagnostic markers  <cit>  and treatments  <cit> . surface proteins of pathogenic bacteria are known to mediate the key step in the bacteria-host interaction during infection and may represent protective antigens and virulence markers. thus, identification of s. agalactiae surface proteins associated with bacterial infection and a greater understanding of their roles in pathogenicity are required. the pre-absorbed immunoproteomics method  was successfully established as a useful tool for identifying bacterial surface proteins in our previous study  <cit>  and has been applied in escherichia coli  <cit>  and campylobacter jejuni  <cit> . this technique involves the separation of proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis  and western blotting with untreated  and “pre-absorbed” serum, which is produced from untreated serum using a modified cross-absorption process to remove bacterial surface antigen-specific antibodies. protein spots that appear in the blot probed with untreated sera, but that are absent in the blot probed with pre-absorbed sera, are assumed to be surface proteins.

in this study, we performed paim analysis of the piscine s. agalactiae strain gd201008- <dig> and identified a serine-rich repeat protein , designated xf, among the potential surface proteins. previous research has indicated that srr- <dig> is an important surface protein for adherence and virulence in human s. agalactiae strains  <cit> . however, the role of srr- <dig> in the pathogenicity of piscine s. agalactiae is unknown. to investigate this issue, a mutant strain  and a complemented strain  were constructed using streptococcus-e. coli shuttle vectors pset4s  <cit>  and pset <dig>  <cit> . their growth characteristics, adherence to hep- <dig> cell and virulence were evaluated in a zebrafish infection model.

RESULTS
pre-absorbed immunoproteomics on s. agalactiae
untreated and pre-absorbed antisera were used to probe 2-de blots of s. agalactiae gd201008- <dig> cell lysates. the immunoreactive spots observed in immunoblots  were matched with the corresponding protein spots observed in the stained 2-de gel  by comparison using the layer function of photoshop cs. in order to minimize the proteomics trial error, the experiments were repeated at least in triplicate, and only the highly reproducible spots were selected. one spot, xf, that invariably appeared in the blot probed with untreated serum , but was less distinct in the blot treated with pre-absorbed serum  in the triplicate repeat tests, was excised from preparative 2-de gels, subjected to tryptic digestion, and then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry  and the psort program. other spots which were not detected using the pre-absorbed serum in repeat experiments were also excised and analyzed by maldi-tof ms; however, these proteins were predicted to be cytoplasmic by the psort program .figure  <dig>

because of the much greater sensitivity of western blotting, the xf spot was more extensive in these blots than in the paired coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig> stained gels. consequently, low abundance proteins with strong immunoreactivity, such as xf, are strongly stained in western blotting analyses. in addition, the serine-rich repeat proteins of s. agalactiae have been reported to be high mw glycoproteins  due to glycosylation  <cit> , although their genes encode just 654– <dig>  amino acids. in the present study, the apparent molecular weight of xf was in the 150 kda range. it can be speculated that the large disparity between the published reports and our result is due to differences in the degree of glycosylation of serine-rich repeat proteins. furthermore, one of the limitations of 2-de is the inability to analyze very large  or very small  proteins  <cit> . consequently, fully glycosylated serine-rich repeat proteins  will not be detected in 2-de.

the srr- <dig> protein from piscine and human s. agalatiae strains
spot xf was identified as a cell wall surface anchor family protein  by maldi-tof ms , also known as a serine-rich repeat protein   <cit> . it has been confirmed that srr- <dig> is localized on the surface of streptococcal cells and binds to human fibrinogen and keratin  <cit> . previous immunoproteomics studies have confirmed that srr- <dig> is a highly immunoreactive protein that is reactive with both s. agalactiae convalescent guinea pig sera and infected tilapia antisera  <cit> . the conserved domain architecture retrieval tool of ncbi  showed that the srr- <dig> protein has an orthologous counterpart among gbs strains: a long and specialized signal sequence, two extensive serine-rich repeat regions  that undergo glycosylation, a fibrinogen-binding domain , which is necessary for binding to human fibrinogen and keratin  <dig>  <cit> , and a typical lpxtg cell wall anchoring motif. the srr- <dig> proteins range in size from  <dig> aa to  <dig>  aa and the c-terminal sas  repeat region  is responsible for the observed size variation, which has also been reported previously by samen et al.  <cit> . blastp analysis showed that the similarity of the amino acid sequence of srr- <dig> proteins from  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa  is greater than 90%, and 100% identical among piscine strains gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig> and human strains a <dig> and cjb <dig>  protein xf contains  <dig> aa, with a sdrg region between 472– <dig> aa and a srr <dig> region from 698– <dig> aa. in piscine s. agalactiae sa20- <dig>  the srr- <dig> protein is only  <dig> aa and devoid of srr <dig> due to a single base  deletion at the position  <dig>  bp in its orf leading to early termination. in the study by takahashi et al.  <cit> , the predicted secondary structures of srr proteins from s. agalactiae are similar to those of srr proteins from other streptococcal species. using the swiss-model tool, we found that the predicted secondary structures of srr- <dig> proteins among s. agalactiae were similar, even when compared with strain sa20- <dig> figure  <dig>

construction of the mutant and complementation strains
to further investigate the function of protein xf in the pathogenesis of piscine s. agalactiae, the plasmids pset4s-xf and pset2-cΔxf were constructed as xf gene deletion  and complementation mutants, respectively.figure  <dig>

the pset4s-xf and pset2-cΔxf plasmids were verified to be correct by diagnostic restriction enzyme digestion with sali/smai and bamhi/psti, respectively . the mutant strains Δxf and cΔxf were confirmed by pcr  and real-time pcr . the primers xf a and d amplified a  <dig>  bp fragment of the Δxf, while no product was generated from the parental and complementation templates. the xf1/xf <dig> primers amplified a 289 bp product from the parental gd201008- <dig> and cΔxf templates while no product was obtained from the Δxf template. all the pcr products obtained had the expected fragment sizes  and in correct sequence.figure  <dig>

to confirm that the mutant has no effect on the transcription of bilateral genes, qrt-pcr assays was performed to detect the expression of xf gene, xf upstream and downstream orf genes in the parental, mutant and complementation strains. data for the three strains were normalized to the expression of the gapdh gene using the 2−ΔΔctmethod. the transcription levels of xf gene in the Δxf were below the level of detection for this assay and there were no significant differences in xf upstream and downstream gene transcription levels between Δxf and cΔxf . these results indicated the successful construction of an isogenic knockout mutant of xf and complementation of Δxf, with no effects on the transcription of bilateral genes. the transcription level of xf in the cΔxf strain replicated from plasmid pet- <dig> was higher than that replicated from the genome of the wild-type strain  due to the increased plasmid copy number compared to the genome replication number, with each new cell acquiring at least one copy of the plasmid as the cell divides. moreover, the plasmid pet- <dig> was constructed from pssu <dig>  a native plasmid isolated from s. suis dat <dig>  <cit>  and belonging to the pmv <dig> plasmid family  <cit> . lorenzo-diaz et al. showed that the number of copies of the pmv <dig> vector was lower in enterococci  than that in pneumococci   <cit> .

growth characteristics of the mutant and complementation strains
before studying the effect of xf inactivation on the pathogenesis of s. agalctiae in vivo, it is important to characterize the growth characteristics of the parental, mutant and complementation strains in vitro. the od <dig> of cultures of the gd201008- <dig> and Δxf strains in tsb broth and cΔxf in tsb broth containing 100 μg/ml spectinomycin at 37°c were determined. in addition, the growth curves of these strains at 28°c were also determined for evaluation of the ld <dig> values in a zebrafish infection model at 28°c. as shown in figure  <dig>  there were no significant differences in the growth curves of the wild-type, Δxf and cΔxf strains at the same temperature. the bacterial population reached a peak during the logarithmic growth phase after 6 h at 37°c and after 10 h at 28°c. moreover, no differences in shape and chain formation were observed between the strains following gram staining .figure  <dig>

contribution of xf to adhesion and invasion in vitro
to investigate the importance of xf for bacterial adherence to, and invasion of host cells, the human epithelial cell line hep- <dig> was infected in vitro with the parental, mutant and complementation strains under the same conditions in triplicate repeat tests. as shown in figure  <dig>  the adherence of the gd201008- <dig> wild-type strain to hep- <dig> cells was only  <dig> % with a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> and there were no significant differences in the adherence to hep- <dig> cells among the gd201008- <dig>  Δxf and cΔxf strains . in the invasion assays, the parental strain gd201008- <dig> displayed poor invasion of hep- <dig> cells  and there were no significant differences in corresponding activity exhibited by the Δxf and cΔxf strains . these results indicate that piscine s. agalactiae gd201008- <dig> has weak capacity for adherence to and invasion of hep- <dig> cells. thus, xf has almost no effect on bacterial adherence and invasion to hep- <dig> cells under the chosen experimental conditions.figure  <dig>

the study by samen et al. showed that srr- <dig> could not mediate bacterial invasion into hep- <dig> cells, but promoted adherence of the s. agalactiae human strain  <dig> to hep- <dig> cells  <cit> . compared with our results, srr- <dig> showed a different effect on adherence to hep- <dig> cells between human and piscine strains. since piscine s. agalactiae gd201008- <dig> showed only weak adhesion capability to hep- <dig> cells, this cell line may not the best choice for investigation of the cell adhesion capacity of piscine s. agalactiae. the contribution of xf to adhesion and invasion in vitro was not clearly reflected under these experimental conditions; therefore, development of an alternative host cell, such as a tilapia epithelial cell line, is required for more accurate evaluation of the adhesion capability of piscine bacteria in vitro. it can be speculated that the poor capacity of the piscine strain for adherence to and invasion of hep- <dig> cells is the result of the loss of some genes nonessential genes involved in adherence to human cells during adaptation to the fish host. for example, there are no lmb or scpb genes derived from the genomes of piscine s. agalactiae strains in the ncbi nr database to date  <cit> . these two genes encode two important adhesins in human strains: laminin-binding protein and c5a peptidase, respectively  <cit> .

virulence of wild-type and Δxf strains in a zebrafish infection model
the zebrafish infection model was used to estimate the effect of the xf mutation on s. agalactiae virulence. this model has already been established for multiple streptococcal infections, including streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> , streptococcus pneumonia  <cit> , streptococcus suis  <cit>  and streptococcus agalactiae  <cit> . zebrafish have many advantages for this purpose, such as the existence of both innate and adaptive immune systems, short generation time, ease of breeding large numbers in the laboratory and suitability for large-scale genetic screens. zebrafish were injected intraperitoneally  with either the parental gd201008- <dig>  Δxf or cΔxf strains at various doses in triplicate repeat tests. the mortality of zebrafish was observed within 7 days post-challenge. as shown in figure  <dig>  the average ld <dig> values determined in triplicate assays were  <dig>  × 102 cfu/zebrafish for the wild-type strain,  <dig>  × 102 cfu/zebrafish for Δxf, and  <dig>  × 102 cfu/zebrafish for cΔxf. the 50% lethal dose of Δxf was increased  compared with that of the parental strain while that of the complementation strain cΔxf was restored to  <dig> -fold higher than that of the mutant strain Δxf. these results indicate a significant reduction in the virulence of s. agalactiae in the Δxf mutant strain .figure  <dig>
