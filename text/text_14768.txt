BACKGROUND
the reliability of phylogenetic analyses on protein-coding sequences strongly depends on models designed to approximate the substitution processes of nucleotide and amino acid. for the evolutionary analysis of protein-coding sequences, particularly phylogenetic inference, three types of substitution models can be used, provided that both dna and protein sequences are available; nucleotide
 <cit> , amino acid
 <cit> , and codon substitution models
 <cit> . for closely-related sequences in which most substitutions are synonymous, amino acid substitution models cannot be used, instead nucleotide substitution models may be employed. conversely, nucleotide substitution models should not be used in the case of diverged sequences in which synonymous substitutions are almost saturated and nonsynonymous substitutions are significant. on the other hand, codon substitution models are appropriate to both closely-related and highly-diverged sequences with the intrinsic property of detecting both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions.

in a reversible markov model for substitution, a substitution rate matrix must be specified to estimate the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree. substitution tendencies between nucleotides and those between amino acids are characteristic of each species, each organelle, and each protein family. in the case of nucleotide substitution models, full parameterization for a substitution rate matrix is possible with  <dig> parameters; the total rate is normalized to one. however,  <dig> parameters for an amino acid substitution rate matrix are too many to be optimized for any size of a multiple sequence alignment. thus, empirical amino acid substitution rate matrices have been estimated from a large number of substitutions inferred on phylogenetic trees of single or many protein families; the jtt
 <cit> , the wag
 <cit> , and the lg
 <cit>  matrices from nuclear proteins, mtrev
 <cit>  from vertebrate mitochondrial proteins, cprev10
 <cit>  and cprev64
 <cit>  from chloroplast-encoded proteins, and flu
 <cit>  from influenza proteins. even a codon substitution rate matrix, khg
 <cit> , has been estimated. these matrices significantly differ from one another, indicating that actually substitution tendencies significantly differ among these protein families. the estimation of a substitution rate matrix requires a large number or size of alignments with intensive calculation, and therefore is not always feasible. however, generic empirical substitution rate matrices such as jtt, wag, lg,and khg represent the average tendencies of substitutions over various protein families by sacrificing gene-level resolution
 <cit> . on the other hand, a rate matrix such as mtrev, cprev <dig>  and flu derived from a specific protein family represents substitution tendencies characteristic of the protein but often lacks generic representation of substitution tendencies enough to be applied to other protein families. to resolve this situation, the parametrization of an amino acid substitution rate matrix has been attempted to easily generate an alignment-specific rate matrix
 <cit> . here, we propose a different approach of employing a mechanistic codon substitution model in which the biological and evolutionary mechanisms of amino acid substitutions are taken into account.

in mechanistic codon substitution models
 <cit> , substitution rates are represented as the product of a codon mutation rate and the ratio of fixation, which depend on the types of codon replacement and amino acid replacement, respectively. hence, mutational tendencies at the nucleotide level and selection at the amino acid level can be taken into account at various levels of separation. this is a critical difference from amino acid substitution models. as a result, the variations of codon mutation rate and selective constraint across sites can be distinguished from each other. we formulated a codon substitution rates between codons μ and ν as
rμν≡mμνewaμbν, with a codon mutation rate mμν, a mutation equilibrium frequency
fνmut, an equilibrium frequency fν, and a selective constraint
waμbν on the substitutions between amino acids aμ and bν <cit> . on the basis of this mechanistic codon substitution model, we estimated the wab by maximizing the likelihood of an empirical amino acid or codon substitution frequency matrix, each of jtt, wag, lg, and khg
 <cit> . it was shown
 <cit>  that the mechanistic codon substitution model with a fully-parameterized codon mutation rate matrix  and a selective constraint matrix , each element of which was approximated as a linear function ,0]) of a given estimate  of selective constraint estimated from the empirical substitution frequency matrix such as jtt and lg, outperformed both nucleotide and amino acid substitution models converted into codon substitution models in the wide range of codon sequences, from closely-related to highly-diverged protein-coding sequences. in this codon substitution model, codon mutations with multiple nucleotide changes are also taken into account, and were shown to increase significantly the likelihood of observed substitutions
 <cit> . there have been a variety of models
 <cit>  for selective pressure on amino acid replacements in mechanistic codon substitution models. for their details, please see
 <cit> , in which the present mechanistic codon substitution model was discussed in comparison with other models.

in these days, dna sequences are first analyzed and protein sequences are translated from them, and consequently codon sequences are likely available for most protein sequences in databases. however, there are protein sequences whose codon sequences are not available or not easily retrieved because of no cross link. in such a case, analysis at the amino acid level must be forced. here we show that even for amino acid sequences, among which synonymous substitutions cannot be identified, the present mechanistic codon substitution model with the assumption of equal codon usage outperforms amino acid substitution models using empirical substitution rate matrices.

the best models in the present amino acid substitution models for the respective datasets are cprev <dig> for cpprot- <dig>  mtrev for mammal-mtprot, and flu for ha_human-flu-a-h1n <dig>  this fact is expected because cprev <dig> was estimated
 <cit>  from the full set of  <dig> protein-coding genes in the  <dig> chloroplast genomes including cpprot- <dig>  mtrev
 <cit>  from the  <dig> mitochondrial proteins of  <dig> vertebrate species, and flu
 <cit>  from ∼ <dig> influenza proteins including ha_human-flu-a-h1n <dig>  hence, the fact shown in the tables indicates that these matrices certainly represent substitution tendencies specific to the respective protein families. on the other hand, cprev10
 <cit>  was estimated from the smaller dataset than that for cprev <dig>  that is,  <dig> proteins in  <dig> chloroplast genomes including  <dig> land plants and the complete genome of cyanobacteria. the size of database used for cprev <dig> may cause the cprev <dig> to perform worse than jtt for cpprot- <dig> 

these tables also show that the log-likelihood values for jtt, wag, and lg are much smaller than those of the reference models and also differ largely from one another, indicating that these empirical substitution matrices represent the average tendencies of substitutions over various protein families but lack gene-level resolution. what are the characteristics of substitutions specific to each protein family? certainly the strength of selective constraint against amino acid substitutions depends on the type of protein, and varies across sites in a protein. however, the dependence of selective constraint on the substituted type of amino acid may result primarily from amino acid properties. hence, in the present mechanistic codon substitution model, we approximate the selective constraint  for a target protein family with a linear function of the particular value  that was estimated from an empirical amino acid substitution frequency matrix and represents the average strength of selective constraint against each type of amino acid substitution over various proteins. in addition, the tendency of nucleotide mutation may differ among nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast dna, and selection on nucleotide substitutions at the dna/rna level may exist and depend on each gene. in the present model, a nucleotide mutation rate matrix is fully parameterized by  <dig> parameters, and one additional parameter  is employed to represent the ratio of multiple to single nucleotide changes in a codon.

tables
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig> clearly show that all the codon substitution models together with the respective selective constraint matrices estimated from jtt, lg, wag, and khg significantly outperform the best amino acid substitution model in all the three datasets, even though  <dig> more parameters must be estimated. here we should notice that the best amino acid substitution rate matrices were estimated from the protein families corresponding to the respective target proteins. in addition, it is important to notice that in agreement with common biological knowledge the mean transitional exchangeability is estimated to be far larger than the mean transversional exchangeability for all protein families in all codon substitution models.

as already claimed for codon sequences in
 <cit> , the variation of selective constraint across sites  is a better model than the variation of codon mutation rate  in all the three datasets. this fact confirms a common presumption that substitution rate variations across sites detected by amino acid substitution models are caused primarily by the variation of selective constraint rather than the mutation rate variation.

in the present analysis,  <dig> categories of unequal probabilities are employed to represent a Γ distribution. this number of categories is chosen to be not sufficient but minimum to represent a Γ distribution. actually, as shown in tables
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig>  representing a Γ distribution by  <dig> categories of unequal probabilities can significantly improve the log-likelihood.

in tables
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig>  the results for the equal constraint model are also listed; selective constraint is the same for all types of amino acid substitutions, that is, β =  <dig>  the aic and bic values of the equal constraint model are larger for the mammalian-mtprot but smaller for the cpprot and ha_human-flu-a-h1n <dig> than those of the reference amino acid substitution models. accordingly, the estimated value of the slope β of a linear function for selective constraints, is larger for the mammalian-mtprot than for the cpprot and ha_human-flu-a-h1n <dig>  this fact indicates that the dependence  of selective constraint on amino acid type is less effective for both cpprot and ha_human-flu-a-h1n <dig>  although this may result from a property that both the datasets consist of relatively closely-related sequences and contain mostly conservative amino acid substitutions.

in the energy-increment-based  model shown in tables
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig>  the selective constraint matrix used is the one estimated on the basis of the mean increment of contact energy and residue-volume change accompanied by an amino acid replacement
 <cit> . although the energy-increment-based selective constraints perform better than the equal constraint, it does not perform as well as the empirical selective constraints estimated from the jtt, wag, lg, and khg, indicating the good quality of their empirical values of the selective constraints.

in the present discrete gamma distribution model for the variation of selective constraint, the value of w <dig> differs among categories, but the same equilibrium frequencies of amino acids, which are estimated to be equal to those in the alignment, are employed for all the categories. amino acid frequencies strongly depend on residue location in protein structures. typically, non-polar residues are more and polar residues are less frequent in the interior of protein structures, where selective constraint against amino acid replacements tends to be more restrictive
 <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . there must be a correlation between the strength of selective constraint and the equilibrium frequencies of amino acids. hence, different equilibrium frequencies should be employed in principle for each category. substitution rate matrices that differ only in their equilibrium frequencies were employed in
 <cit> , <cit> . in
 <cit> , <cit> , a different rate matrix was employed for each of gamma rate categories and biochemical and structural categories. le et al.
 <cit>  estimated from a very large alignment database and then tested four amino acid substitution rate matrices each of which corresponds to one discrete gamma category or one distribution-free category and has different exchangeabilities and equilibrium frequencies. here, we estimate amino acid frequencies for each category from the posterior probabilities of sites being at each category and then parameters are optimized again with the estimated amino acid frequencies for each category. the aic and bic values for this new model named with a suffix "-dg4sf" are also listed in tables
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig>  the values of aic and bic are improved for mammal-mtprot and cpprot- <dig> but not for ha_human-flu-a-h1n <dig>  this model requiring additional  <dig> parameters needs a sufficient number of amino acid substitutions in an alignment to yield better values of aic and bic.

CONCLUSIONS
the greatest advantage of employing a mechanistic codon substitution model over amino acid substitution models resides in an intrinsic property that mutational tendencies of codons and selective constraints against amino acid changes can be separately formulated in codon substitution models. as a result, codon mutational tendencies and the strength of selective constraint can be tailored to those in each gene with the additional  <dig> parameters, although a sufficient number of sequences and more calculations are needed for their estimation. also, besides mutation rate variation, the variation of selective constraint across sites can be taken into account. at the amino acid level, synonymous substitutions cannot be identified. even so, taking account of synonymous substitutions with a codon substitution model improves its performance, as shown in the present analysis. since mutations occur in nucleotide level, codon mutations may be well approximated by a markov process. however, markovian properties are lost in the process of amino acid substitutions, because of redundancy of translation to amino acids. a hidden markov model, in which codon types are hidden states changing in a markov process, is more appropriate to represent amino acid substitutions. this may be one of reasons why the mechanistic codon substitution model outperforms any amino acid substitution model examined here.

a conclusion is drawn that the mechanistic codon substitution model is superior to amino acid substitution models even for protein sequences in evolutionary analysis.
