BACKGROUND
identification of transcription regulatory elements in a genome is an actively evolving topic in modern molecular biology. the major class of these elements is represented by transcription factor  binding sites , short dna segments of 10-20 bp specifically recognized by tfs. modern high-throughput techniques, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation  followed by microarray hybridization  or by massively parallel sequencing , allow genome-scale mapping of tf occupancy in a given cell type and state  <cit> . to date, thousands of binding loci for a large number of tfs have been revealed for various cell types  <cit> . however, both chip-seq and chip-chip technologies are not able to distinguish direct tf binding to dna from indirect binding mediated by other chromatin proteins including other tfs bound to cognate dna sites   <cit> . prediction of the genome-wide tf binding landscape, i.e. identification of the entire set of tfbss existing in a particular genome irrespective to the cell type and state, is also unlikely to be done without proper tfbs modeling in silico. furthermore, chip-seq identifies exact locations of tfbss only indirectly and cannot discriminate between closely spaced multiple sites within dna segments of hundreds of base pairs  <cit> .

to identify tfbss in a given sequence one applies computational methods for their recognition. a myriad of such methods exists today, falling into two main classes  <cit> . the first class is based on pattern matching, also called motif finding. in this case, the tfbs recognition model is constructed on an independent training set of tfbs sequences obtained from conventional gene-by-gene experimental studies. the pattern is often represented as a positional weight matrix  which assumes that nucleotides in bs sequence additively and independently contribute to the total binding energy  <cit> . the pwm is widely used for tfbss recognition in genomic sequences, e.g. to interpret chip-seq data. a number of information resources contain the ready-to-use tfbs matrices, namely, transfac  <cit> , jaspar  <cit> , artsite  <cit> , hocomoco  <cit>  etc. the performance of conventional pwms can be improved if dependencies between adjacent positions are taken into account, e.g. using so-called dinucleotide pwms  <cit> . the next improvement of this approach is a proper selection of matrix length, i.e. construction of optimized pwm   <cit> . more sophisticated and much less commonly used methods do not include “the additivity assumption”, i.e. nucleotides in different positions may depend on each other  <cit> . among these methods is our previously developed sitega, well-proven in recognition of various tfbss  <cit> .

the second class of methods is oriented towards de novo pattern detection, and referred to as motif discovery, also often utilizing pwms as the tfbs model. initially, motif discovery was proposed to identify tfbss in promoter sequences of co-regulated or orthologous genes. although motif discovery algorithms have been shown to work successfully in bacteria and yeast, they performed significantly worse in higher organisms  <cit> . however, the motif discovery approach has become of extremely high value with the emergence of chip-chip/chip-seq technologies  <cit> . currently, many variations of such methods exist, some of them are presented in well-known resources. chipmunk  <cit>  and dichipmunk  <cit>  belong to this class. using the basic pwm model chipmunk performed nicely in several independent benchmarks  <cit> , including the recent one of the dream consortium  <cit> . dichipmunk uses the same engine as chipmunk to produce dinucleotide pwms.

it is of great interest to compare the performance of the motif discovery and motif finding approaches applied to the same experimental data. however, no such studies have been carried out until now. moreover, a comparative analysis of the advantages and shortcomings of different methods is hampered by the lack of direct experimental verification of predicted tfbss.

using a foxa <dig> chip-seq data for mouse adult liver chromatin  <cit>  and human hepatoma cell line chromatin  <cit>  we conducted a comparative assessment of opwm and sitega , chipmunk, and dichipmunk , which was accompanied by experimental verification.

foxa <dig> is a member of the foxa subfamily of winged helix/forkhead box  transcription factors playing important roles at different stages of mammalian life cycle, including early development, organogenesis, and metabolism and homeostasis in the adult  <cit> . foxa <dig> was shown to be a pioneer transcription factor  <cit> , thus indirect  binding of foxa <dig> to chromatin should not be a major event. with the independent human and mouse liver chip-seq datasets available foxa <dig> is one of the most convenient tfs to compare different computer approaches for prediction of tfbss.

RESULTS
identification of foxa binding sites in promoter chip-seq loci
initially, to compare the performance of pattern matching and pattern detection approaches for tfbs prediction in the context of chip-seq data, we applied opwm and sitega  as well as chipmunk and dichipmunk  to analyze a dataset of  <dig> foxa2-binding loci  in mouse adult liver chromatin  <cit> .

to produce a subset of data for experimental verification we restricted the search to foxa2-binding loci that overlapped with 1 kb upstream regions of refseq genes  and had coverage at least  <dig> . totally  <dig> putative foxa bss were predicted in these regions. each bs was characterized by a set of four scores corresponding to the four models used. the thresholds applied were very low, so that among selected putative bss were those with non-consistent functionality. the pairwise comparison of scores  showed a good agreement between models of the same class . thus, there was a strong correlation between predictions of opwm/sitega  and chipmunk/dichipmunk . the agreement between other pairs of models was notably lower . although a considerable portion of points still landed close to the scatterplot diagonal, i.e. many sites are similarly scored even by principally differing models , there was a considerable number of sequences with a significantly higher score assigned by only one of the models, i.e. displaying incompatible predictions of different models. thus, a special interest was to determine whether these sites were able to bind tfs in practice.figure  <dig>

experimental verification of predicted foxa binding sites by emsa
out of  <dig> bss predicted in promoter regions,  <dig> were arbitrarily selected for experimental verification by emsa. among them there were the sites quite differently evaluated by the models used . the main advantage of emsa is unambiguity in interpretation of the results. this method records the fact of the tf binding to the oligonucleotide corresponding to a predicted site, thereby making it possible to set the threshold directly and restrict the false-positives  <cit> . in this study, double-stranded oligonucleotides for  <dig> selected foxa sites were individually added in ascending concentrations as cold competitors to the binding reaction of labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to a well-known foxa site from mouse ttr promoter  <cit>  with purified gst-fkh-foxa <dig> protein. a representative autoradiograph of separated complexes is shown on figure 2a.figure  <dig>

rough estimate of tfbs affinities relative to that of ttr oligonucleotide were calculated . it was found, that the distribution of estimated the emsa scores for  <dig> tested sites was essentially continuous , which agrees with the previous data for other tfs  <cit> . based on the experimental results, all the studied sequences were divided into three groups: a) non-sites, emsa scores below  <dig> ; b) weak sites, emsa scores from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and c) strong sites, emsa scores above  <dig>  . thus, the group of non-sites consisted of sequences whose ability to bind to gst-fkh-foxa <dig> was not significantly different from the unrelated sequence.

comparison of the predictions and the experimental data are shown in figure  <dig>  most of the non-sites receive low scores from all the models . in the case of the strong and the weak sites the picture is different. as expected, models of the same class  predicted sites concentrating in the top right corner of the scatterplot , i.e. the predictions were mostly consistent. at the same time, predictions were less consistent for motif discovery versus motif-finding approaches. there were many sites with high scores from one model and low scores from another , e.g. sitega versus chipmunk predictions . these models utilized different training sets, and algorithms . so, a combination of such fundamentally different models can be the most effective in analyzing genome-wide chip-seq data.

for further analysis we selected emsa score cutoff of  <dig> , which allowed determination of the thresholds for prediction models on a common basis . these are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for chipmunk, dichipmunk, sitega and opwm, respectively. for each model, we selected the threshold value as the highest score for the subset of non-sites .

identification of foxa binding sites in genome-wide chip-seq data
figure  <dig> shows scatterplots of scores of potential foxa sites predicted in all  <dig> foxa2-binding loci  <cit> . as for the promoter regions, closely related models evaluated most of the sites in a similar manner , whereas application of strongly differing approaches resulted in a substantial fraction of sites scoring highly by only one of them . the use of thresholds, determined by emsa , allowed us to discard sequences without threshold-passing predictions, i.e. possibly not capable to bind foxa directly. as a result, sitega identifies  <dig> reliable foxa sites in  <dig> % of peaks, chipmunk –  <dig> in  <dig> % of peaks, and dichipmunk–  <dig> in  <dig> % of peaks. however, only  <dig> foxa sites in  <dig> % of peaks are identified with opwm approach, i.e. opwm showed the weakest performance of all four models. it is worth noting that combined use of the models significantly increases the resulting number of the peaks with the identified sites. as expected, among all combinations the best was sitega/chipmunk with  <dig> % of peaks  with bss recognized by at least one model out of the pair. another good combination was dichipmunk/sitega with  <dig> % peaks . a detailed analysis of sitega/chipmunk and dichipmunk/sitega results showed that the majority of chip-seq peaks contained more than one site . these results were in agreement with existing observations that foxa prefers to bind to clusters of sites in the regulatory regions of well-studied target genes .figure  <dig>

the results show the high efficiency of the sitega model, as well as both participants from pattern-detection class . however, since the latter models were trained on the same data as used for the performance evaluation, the correct comparative assessment requires an additional independent control chip-seq dataset.

application of tfbs models to the control foxa chip-seq dataset
the dataset described in  <cit>  was taken as an independent control and contained  <dig> foxa2-binding loci, with read coverage of at least  <dig>  in this dataset sitega, chipmunk, dichipmunk and opwm models recognized  <dig> sites in  <dig> % of peaks,  <dig> sites in  <dig> % of peaks,  <dig> sites in  <dig> % of peaks,  <dig> sites in  <dig> % of peaks respectively, showing almost the same performance as on wederell’s data  <cit> . note that opwm again had the worst prediction rate.

we expected the combination of models from different classes  would be more effective for analysis of genome-wide chip-seq data. to estimate performance of pairwise combinations of our four models we computed the number of peaks with bss recognized by each pairs of models. the following cases were separately processed:  peaks with at least one  bs predicted by two models,  peaks with sites recognized by only one of the two models and  peaks with only non-overlapping site predictions of by two models . note, that the total sum of these fractions reflects the total number of peaks where at least one site was found by any of the two tested models.figure  <dig> 
the fraction of chip-seq peaks
 with recognized sites as a function of the peak height cut-off value. six panels from a to f denote predictions computed for all possible pairwise combinations of chipmunk, dichipmunk, sitega and opwm models. the x and y axes show the fraction of peaks having at least one foxa binding site recognized by the respective model and the peak height cut-off value. the panels from a to f show the comparisons between sitega and opwm, chipmunk and dichipmunk, sitega and chipmunk, sitega and dichipmunk models, respectively. the following grouping of recognized tfbss is used: loci with tfbss recognized by both the first and second models  that either overlap or not, are marked by red and orange, respectively; loci with at least one foxa binding site recognized by the first but not by the second model, or vice versa, are marked by green and blue, respectively. black vertical lines denote the coverage threshold .



for all pairwise combinations the dependence of the fraction of recognized peaks from the peak height cut-off demonstrated a non-monotonic behavior, with significant growth from approximately 50% of recognized peaks at a cutoff value of  <dig> and a nearly uniform distribution at cutoff values of  <dig> and higher. basically, this means that more erroneous peaks or weak sites are detected near the lower peak height of  <dig>  supporting the choice of the peak height cutoff value of  <dig> for our study.

the models from the same class  poorly complemented each other, giving a moderate rise in the number of peaks with recognized bss for the chipmunk/dichipmunk pair  and almost no effect for opwm/sitega as sitega managed to recognize almost every peak detected by opwm .

on the contrary, the combination of pattern-matching and pattern-detection models showed a substantial increase in the number of peaks with recognized bss. among all combinations the best again were sitega/chipmunk and sitega/dichipmunk, with  <dig> % and  <dig> % peaks recognized by at least one model out of a pair, respectively . more than a half of detected sites were recognized by two models simultaneously:  <dig> % of sites  and  <dig> %  for sitega/chipmunk and dichipmunk/sitega, respectively . the fractions of peaks solely detected by a particular model were  <dig> % for sitega and  <dig> % for chipmunk . for another combination, the respective fractions were  <dig> % for sitega and  <dig> % for dichipmunk . the fractions of simultaneously detected peaks with non-overlapped sites were  <dig> % and  <dig> % . a more detailed analysis of sitega/chipmunk and dichipmunk/sitega results again shows that the majority of peaks contained more than one site,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. these estimates are very similar to those computed above for wederell’s chip-seq data  <cit> .

to get an estimate for the fraction of simultaneously detected peaks with non-overlapping sites expected by chance we performed a tenfold simulation on a random 1st order markov chain background set that was generated by shuffling full-length peaks. we count observed and expected fractions of peaks with non-overlapped sites among all peaks detected by two models. for the sitega/chipmunk pair the expected fraction was  <dig> % and observed one was  <dig> % . this provides evidence that these non-overlapping predictions are likely nonrandom and are due to heterogeneity of the foxa bss sequences and their preference to form homotypic tfbs clusters.

thus, usage of a pair of different models allowed both an increase in the number of peaks with precisely positioned sites, and identification of multiple sites within a single peak. the latter is quite important, since homotypic clusters of tfbss are often found in the gene regulatory regions, underlying a number of mechanistic advantages  <cit> . these may include favoring high-affinity cooperative tf binding and lateral diffusion of tf binding along regulatory regions, or simply increasing of the local tf concentration in the vicinity of these regions and thereby increase the probability of functional interactions .

note that opwm can also provide a benefit when sitega is not available. for example, opwm slightly increased the number of peaks with detected bss  and the number of peaks with non-overlapping sites detected by different models .

comparison of constructed and existing foxa tfbs models
to compare the performance of the four models constructed in this study with known tfbs models we used four additional pwms: ma <dig>   <cit>  and ma <dig>   <cit>  from jaspar  <cit> , m <dig>  <cit>  and m <dig>  <cit>  from transfac  <cit> . among them only the latter was not derived from chip-seq data. receiver operating characteristic  curves were used to compare eight models with wallerman dataset  <cit>  . false positive rates were estimated over the first order markov chain background-set that was generated by shuffling full-length peak sequences. roc curves close to the top left corner correspond to the models with better performance. figure 5a clearly shows that the dichipmunk model outperformed all others ones. this seems to be a consequence of the dinucleotide in contrast to mononucleotide statistics used by other chip-seq-derived models. the transfac pwm m <dig> showed the worst performance. to compare other models in detail, we computed the correlation coefficients  that reflect the relationship between true and false positive rates  <cit> . the cc values were computed for the emsa-based thresholds chosen earlier. emsa thresholds for additional models were selected as described above . the chipmunk, jaspar and m <dig>  matrices showed similar performance, leaving transfac m <dig> and jaspar ma <dig>  the worst among chip-seq-derived models. note that the performance of sitega was on a par with those for chip-seq-derived models, outperforming other models not derived from chip-seq data, opwm and transfac m <dig>  thus sitega performed the best among models not derived from chip-seq data, most probably because of its additional information relating distant sequence positions  <cit>  . to confirm that the selected emsa score  <dig>  is appropriate, we performed correlation coefficient calculations for two additional emsa score values  <dig>  and  <dig>  . one can see that for all models except the worst one  cc computed for emsa score  <dig>  are notably lower than ones for emsa scores  <dig>  and  <dig> . among the latter two that provide similar cc values for nearly all models  the first emsa score  was chosen as less stringent.figure  <dig>

we suspect that several factors are crucial in explaining performance of different models :  the training data-set, either chip-seq derived or not;  a visible improvement for conventional pwms if dinucleotide statistics are used along with extension of a matrix length ;  accounting for possible distant dependencies .

discussion
computational methods of tfbs recognition provide important tools to analyze chip-seq data  <cit> . many different tools were presented for motif discovery in chip-seq data, including meme-chip  <cit> , rsat peak-motifs  <cit> , dimont  <cit> . yet, it is commonly pwms from jaspar and transfac that are applied for the approval of chip-seq data. a few attempts were made to properly train complex models  <cit> .

however, in the absence of additional experimental verification of tfbs models, it is difficult to estimate key model parameters, such as recognition thresholds, which would correctly separate true-positive from false-positive predictions. ignorance of these thresholds, in turn, greatly complicates both the interpretation of chip-seq data and the performance comparison of tfbs-prediction methods.

application of several models for tfbs prediction in this study allowed us to resolve two important issues:  whether advanced pattern match models , if properly trained on a limited curated tfbs set, can compete with pattern discovery models  trained on chip-seq data; and  whether these advanced models can complement each other or commonly applied pwms .

using foxa bss as a case study, we have applied emsa to determine thresholds for eight models of tfbs recognition. the use of these thresholds in the analysis of chip-seq profiles for foxa <dig> in adult mouse liver  <cit>  and in human hepg <dig> cells  <cit>  allowed us to reliably identify thousands of foxa bss within chip-seq peaks and to conduct an adequate comparison of the computational models studied.

first of all, in some cases models for tfbs recognition are able to find trustworthy sites only in a small subset of peaks, e.g. 29% for transfac m <dig> and 43% for opwm . this fraction is not what one should expect from a transfac model, and only performing the emsa experiment allowed us to compute an accurate estimate. application of such models for finding tfbss in a major subset of chip-seq peaks would require too low threshold value giving too many false positives. hence, the threshold choice is the key point for getting trustworthy tfbs-recognition results from chip-seq pipelines. it is important for different tasks, e.g. identification of reliable tfbss in chip-seq data or studying the ratio of direct and indirect protein binding to chromatin. while emsa was used here for selecting thresholds, there could be other, less labor-intensive approaches, for example fluorescence correlation spectroscopy   <cit> . it is noteworthy that once experimental verification is done for a particular protein, it could be re-used for defining the thresholds for any corresponding tfbs model and interpreting any chip-seq experiment for this protein, as we have demonstrated on the independent human foxa <dig> chip-seq dataset  <cit> .

we conclude that models derived from chip-seq usually outperformed the others. the important exception is sitega, most probably due to its more complex algorithm of information extraction and recognition. but this outperformance does not diminish the value of the models trained on independent data, which provide a way to verify the results obtained from a chip-seq pipeline.

we have confirmed the supremacy of dinucleotide statistics for the tfbs models, showing its advantages for both classes of methods. an important component of this advantage comes from the informative data in the flanking regions of the tfbs “core” sequence. the consequence is typically longer matrix length, e.g. transfac m <dig>  vs. opwm  and chipmunk  vs. dichipmunk .

the models based on different principles complement each other. combined use of the models allowed better identification of foxa sites in corresponding chip-seq peaks. the best results for bs prediction in chip-seq data were achieved by model combinations, e.g. sitega plus dichipmunk, successfully identifying up to 90% of foxa bs-containing loci in both the mouse and human chip-seq data.

CONCLUSIONS
nowadays chip-seq is the gold standard for studying tf-chromatin interactions in vivo. detailed analysis of tfbs in chip-seq data requires validated computational tfbs-recognition tools. the choice of the appropriate thresholds for tfbs models is one of the key steps that has been often underappreciated. we carried out an experimental study of foxa binding to oligonucleotides, corresponding to predicted sites. this allowed us to determine the thresholds for several chip-seq derived and conventional models, improving their ability to predict tfbss. this also allowed us to compare models accurately using the independent control chip-seq dataset, and conclude that  the weak ability to detect sites properly;  although pattern-discovery models derived from chip-seq in general are better than conventionally derived pattern-match models, the latter valuably complement the former in annotation of chip-seq data;  integration of different models allows detecting reliable sites in up to 90% of chip-seq loci.
