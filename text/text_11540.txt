BACKGROUND
rna interference  in mammalian cells is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that functions to regulate gene expression via small hairpin-like dsrna molecules called microrna . mirna precursors  are first processed in the nucleus by a drosha complex cleaving ~  <dig> bp back from the stem-loop junction  to release a  <dig> -  <dig> nucleotide  hairpin   <cit> . in the cytoplasm, dicer next cleaves from the opposite end , removing the loop to release a small rna duplex of ~  <dig> bp   <cit> . the duplex is then unwound and loaded into the rna induced silencing complex  in a process that favors one of the two strands  based on a difference in thermodynamic stability at the ends of the duplex  <cit> . the guide strand directs the risc to bind target rna, and in the context of mammalian rnai, generally results in target degradation if the match is perfect, or translational repression if the match is imperfect.

rnai can also be co-opted by delivering synthetic short interfering rna  duplexes of ~  <dig> -  <dig> bp that are loaded directly into risc  <cit> . alternatiely, short hairpin rna   can be expressed from polymerase iii promoters  <cit>  to be subsequently processed. shrna design often occurs by the addition of a loop to an optimally designed sirna core, which may also be extended to increase the stem length . whilst there are now many sirna design guidelines  <cit> , the additional parameters specific to shrnas - such as stem length, core position, flanking and loop sequence, are not so well-defined.

while stem typically varies between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, few studies have investigated its importance for suppressive activity and these were neither overlapping in scope nor corroborative in conclusion  <cit> . some of the conclusions include: poor short hairpins  can be improved with an increase in stem length   <cit> , longer hairpins  are simply more active  <cit> , and shorter hairpins  are better  <cit> . the situation is clearly unclear. additionally, there are more recent claims that longer synthetic sirna/shrna duplexes  are better due to 'improved dicer processing'  <cit> . but, this may not apply to expressed shrna as the synthetic approach may not incorporate processing events upstream of dicer recognition. despite this the high-profile nature of this research has lead to a general expectation that increasing the stem length of an expressed shrna will also lead to enhanced processing and therefore enhanced suppression  <cit> . our work and other recent reports now challenge this expectation  <cit> .

in cases where the selected stem length exceeds the length of the designed sirna core, then the placement of the core within the shrna must also be considered. in this sense the terms 'core' and 'placement' refer to a predetermined sirna sequence from which shrnas are often derived, and its position within the  longer shrna stem. current understanding from in vitro dicer studies is that rna duplex processing occurs from the termini  <cit> , but again, whether this is equally applicable for expressed shrna is currently unknown. although placement of the core has varied for traditional shrnas, including positions  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit>  and others , there has been no systematic study investigating its importance for subsequent activity.

in this study we asked how is the suppressive activity of expressed shrna altered when changing the length of the stem, and how does suppressive activity relate to the placement of a predetermined sirna core within the shrna stem? to answer these questions we tested more than  <dig> hairpins targeting hiv- <dig> tat or vpu, varying in both stem length and sequence composition. we found no fixed correlation between stem length and suppressive activity, and showed that core placement at the base terminus is critical for activity.

RESULTS
the most common stem lengths are  <dig> and  <dig> bp
we first surveyed  <dig> expressed shrna studies to determine the most commonly used hairpin stem lengths and loop sequences . all stem lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> base-pairs , with  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  the most common. it was also found that ~ 60% of studies use the same  <dig> base loop  first reported in one of the earliest shrna studies  <cit> .

closer analysis of this loop reveals that it is predicted to pair internally  resulting in a collapsed loop size of  <dig> bases  and a stem which is extended by  <dig> bp   <cit> . therefore, when adjusting the surveyed stem lengths for this extra sequence, the frequency of  <dig> bp stems drops to 11% and the frequency of  <dig> bp stems rises to 60%, making  <dig> bp the most common length .

short and long shrnas are both potent suppressors
to investigate the effects of increasing stem length on shrna activity, we designed a set of  <dig> hairpins with  <dig>   <dig> -  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp stem lengths . this included every length between the common bounds of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, plus some additional shorter and longer ones. all were designed to target tat , initiating from a common 5' position , with the stem/target sequence extending in the 3' direction. all other factors of the hairpin design were kept constant. suppressive activities were measured as a reduction in gfp fluorescence from a target-fusion reporter, after transient expression of both the hairpin and reporter in hek293a cells, relative to an empty expression vector control . an additional non-targeted reporter was included so as to measure and normalize for non-specific effects. non-specific activity is represented by the normalization factor in fold-changes relative to the empty expression vector control, where a factor of  <dig>  represents no non-specific activity.

hairpins shorter than  <dig> bp and longer than  <dig> bp showed no notable activity . those from  <dig> -  <dig> bp were all active, with a progressive increase in activity in lengths from  <dig> -  <dig> to  <dig> -  <dig> bp. however, the potency of the shorter hairpin of  <dig> bp was a notable exception to this progression, with high suppressive activity indistinguishable from the  <dig> -  <dig> bp hairpins . expression analysis  confirmed the presence of the expected products for hairpins across the range of  <dig> -  <dig> bp stem lengths. products for hairpins shorter than  <dig> bp were not detected. hairpins longer than  <dig> bp had low levels of detectable product which may have been due to inefficient processing, or less of the probe-specific sequence being incorporated into the active product. we also noticed that the processed product for the  <dig> bp hairpin appeared smaller than those of the other hairpins and thus we conducted additional high-resolution analysis  . unexpectedly, this showed that many hairpins were processed into multiple products, and clearly showed that the products of the  <dig> and  <dig> bp hairpins were smaller than those from the longer hairpins. hairpins shorter than  <dig> bp had a single predominant product, whereas those of  <dig> bp and longer had  <dig>  importantly, these experiments showed that shorter hairpins can be just as potent as their longer counterparts.

hairpins of different lengths are similarly dose-dependent
to investigate whether the activity differences for hairpins of different length had different dose-dependences, we looked at a sub-set of these hairpins  at various dosages. suppressive activities were measured using hairpin expression vector amounts from  <dig>  -  <dig> ng . each sample was supplemented with the appropriate amount of empty expression vector to keep the total dna delivered constant, thus maintaining consistent transfection conditions between samples. the dose-effect relationships were similar for all hairpin lengths except for the  <dig> bp hairpin for which higher doses were required for half-maximal and maximal activity. for all lengths tested there was a dosage at which the system was saturated and no further increase in suppressive activity was achievable by adding more vector alone.

there is no fixed correlation between stem length and activity
we further tested the relationship between stem length and suppressive activity by looking at different targets, including another  <dig> target sets of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp hairpins directed to different regions of another hiv-1nl4- <dig> gene, vpu . as before, all hairpins within each set initiated from a common 5' terminus. for  <dig> sets we observed a trend of increasing activity with stem length , in another we saw the opposite trend , and in the final set all hairpins were highly active . we thus expanded this last set to include  <dig> and  <dig> bp versions; lengths generally considered too short to be effective substrates for dicer processing  <cit> , and found that activity could be retained in a stem length of  <dig> bp. we also tested another  <dig> matched tat hairpin pairs that were available to us. each of these pairs comprised the most common short  and long  hairpins, with each pair targeting a different region of tat . the short hairpins ranged from highly active to inactive, and  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs showed a significant loss in suppressive activity with an increase in stem length, irrespective of the activity level of the short hairpin . thus, overall we conclude that there is no fixed correlation between stem length and activity.

target-matched sequence at the base terminus is critical for activity
given that the most common stem lengths are bound between  <dig> and  <dig> bp , we created several sets of  <dig> bp hairpins that differed in the placement and amount of sequence that was homologous to the target in odd-length increments from  <dig> to  <dig> bp to study core positioning. these were all created around the same target as before . in the first set, inverted sequence was introduced at the loop terminus in  <dig> bp increments so as to be mismatched to the target, but to retain an identical thermodynamic profile  . inclusion of target-mismatched bases at the loop terminus was well tolerated with no significant loss in suppressive activity for hairpins with  <dig> bp or more of matched sequence to the target . hairpins containing less than  <dig> target-matched bases had impaired suppressive activity, and the hairpin with only  <dig> bp of target-matched sequence was non-functional. processed products were detected as expected.

inverted sequence was similarly introduced in the second set, but from the opposite terminus . unlike the first set, even the smallest inclusion of target-mismatched sequence impaired activity . the slight increase in activity with  <dig> mismatches, compared to  <dig> mismatches , occurred consistently , but for unknown reasons. hairpins with  <dig> or more target-mismatched base pairs at the base terminus were non-functional. processed products were not detected for hairpins with only  <dig> and  <dig> bp of target-matched sequence at the loop terminus; however, this was most likely due to inadequate homology with the probe. overall, the results suggested that for hairpins with  <dig> bp stems, the primary  agent was derived from positions  <dig> -  <dig> to  <dig> -  <dig> of the paired stem, and was therefore  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> bases long, which was within the size range of the processed products perviously detected.

the entire length of a  <dig> bp hairpin stem is not equally processed
to test the importance of core placement in a second way, another set of  <dig> bp hairpins was made with an active  <dig> bp sirna core placed at each of the  <dig> possible positions . this experiment thus tests the outcome of placing the core at all of the different positions possible within a given shrna stem length. to avoid confusion in following this work, remember that the 'core' corresponds to a predetermined sirna, and in this case, one already verified as highly active. as before, the sequence outside the core was inverted to be mismatched to the target. progressive repositioning of the core towards the loop terminus correlated with reduced activity. the most active  <dig> bp hairpin had the core positioned at the base terminus  confirming for longer hairpins that it is the sequence at the base terminus that is the primary contributor to suppressive activity. however, we also found that the  <dig> bp control hairpin  was more active than the equivalent  <dig> bp hairpin  . the processed products were detected at approximately equivalent levels between all variants with the exception of the 3-21- <dig> variant. the reasons for this exception were unclear, but given that it did not correlate to a relative change in the measured suppressive activity we considered that it is was most likely an artifact of the detection process, e.g. inefficient probe binding. the activity results support the conclusion that the entire length of the stem is not equally processed into multiple sirna species. these findings further support the idea that it is the base terminus from which processing occurs, such that as we progressively moved our core along  we were most likely creating processed  products with decreasing homology to the target .

most cloned processed products originate from the base terminus
the processed products for the fully-matched  <dig> bp hairpin  were cloned  to verify the notion that the base terminus was giving rise to the most prominent processed product. cells were transfected with the hairpin expression vector and total rna was isolated  <dig> hours later. short rna species were selectively isolated  and cloned using the lau and bartel small rna cloning protocol  <cit> . six species that aligned to the hairpin were identified from  <dig> total species cloned and sequenced . five of these, sp <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  originated from the base terminus of hairpin between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and one, sp <dig> came from positions  <dig> -  <dig>  though the number of relevant sequences recovered were few, these confirmed that multiple different-length products can be generated from a single shrna, with a bias towards processing from the base terminus .

a  <dig> bp hairpin can be improved by an increase in stem length
on comparing all data sets, we noted that the activity of the  <dig> bp hairpin composed of  <dig> bp of target-matched sequence at the base terminus, with  <dig> bp of inverted sequence at the loop terminus, was significantly more active than the corresponding hairpin with a perfectly target-matched  <dig> bp stem . this suggests that the additional  <dig> bp increased the activity of the hairpin purely as a function of increased stem length and not target-specificity. therefore, another set of  <dig> bp hairpins was made with  <dig> bp of target-matched sequence at the base terminus plus  <dig> bp sequence extensions with alternative sequence compositions . all variants remained highly active, irrespective of the sequence composition. however, the activities of hairpins with weakly bound extensions  were not significantly different from the original hairpin . by contrast, the activities of the hairpins with more strongly bound extensions  were significantly reduced . we extended this experiment by creating an additional set of hairpins of  <dig> -  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp stems in which only the first  <dig> bp was matched to the target, with the remaining sequence inverted . the suppressive activity of these partially matched hairpins closely followed that of their fully matched counterparts tested earlier , further suggesting that increasing stem length beyond  <dig> bp, irrespective of target specificity, can enhance activity. this however, is not necessarily always true of other targets, nor of comparisons between shorter hairpins  and  <dig> bp hairpins, as evident from our prior hairpin sets.

discussion
we analyzed more than  <dig> expressed shrnas that varied in target site, stem length, and sequence composition to study the effects of changing stem length and core placement on suppressive activity. in contrast to in vitro studies  <cit> , which focus on isolated points of the rnai processing pathway, our hairpins were subject to every cellular processing step, increasing the relevance of our findings to present shrna use. our results conclusively show that there is no fixed correlation between hairpin stem length and suppressive activity. in some cases activity was increased by the addition of extra sequence , yet in others it was not. we found that the placement of the designed sirna core at the base terminus was critical for activity, as the entire length of the hairpin stem was not equally processed into active products. we found highly active hairpins from all stem lengths tested between  <dig> to  <dig> bp, plus an active  <dig> bp hairpin as well. this is a very interesting finding, as in conjunction with the recent report that synthetic sirna triggers of only  <dig> bp are still effective silencers  <cit> , it suggests that the minimal effective duplex size may be smaller than previously thought.

taken together, our results lead us to speculate that shrnas may be processed differently depending on stem length, with divisions at ~  <dig> bp and ~  <dig> bp. those shorter than  <dig> bp may bypass one or more processing steps, which is supported by reports that both  <dig> bp sirna duplexes  <cit>  and  <dig> bp synthetic shrna  <cit>  are not processed by dicer, yet they retain in vivo activity. this, however, may also relate to loop size , where shorter loops of ~  <dig> nt.  may be less likely to engage dicer  <cit> . our hairpins of  <dig> to ~  <dig> bp seem to have a common position of processing relative to the base terminus which is consistent with the known mechanism of dicer  <cit> . in vitro studies have shown that the exact point of dicer cleavage can vary, yielding more than one product differing by  <dig> -  <dig> bp  <cit> . this provides a mechanism for the multiple products we observed here. in contrast to dicer, drosha processes relative to the opposite end; measuring back from the stem-loop junction  <cit> . although drosha  requires a large loop for efficient processing , in its absence it may separate an adjacent portion of the stem to attain it  <cit> . this supports our interpretation that the stem of  <dig> bp hairpins may be unwound outside the active ~  <dig> bp base-terminus region. we stress, however, that these are only speculative interpretations to position our findings in the context of the current understanding of the field. they, of course, require testing using a number of knockout-type studies  and extensive deep-sequencing of different length shrnas . it would also be very revealing to do detailed follow-up work on further data sets, such as with the  <dig> vpu data sets, and include northern and sequencing analysis to begin to assemble some guidelines for future shrna constructions.

presumed processing by either dicer or both drosha and dicer is now generally considered to result in both greater sirna production and potency  <cit> . although this may allow for activity at lower dna concentrations, which may be beneficial for reducing non-specific effects  <cit> , we surmise that it does not reliably dictate increased shrna activity. instead, our data leads us to conclude that the primary determinant of activity is inherent to the sequence of the processed product - regardless of the mode of processing. furthermore, there are claims that coordinated processing by both drosha and dicer will reduce the heterogeneity of the processed products  <cit> . our data shows that for longer lengths, with presumably increased processing , there are more products formed and thus increased processing alone is not a predictor for a more defined product. given that it is the product identity that determines activity, multiple products could cause competition such that the activity of a potent suppressor may be 'diluted', a view shared by others  <cit> . some suggest that it may be possible to engage both drosha and dicer to yield a single defined product by using 'second-generation' hairpin designs that more closely replicate specific microrna structures   <cit> . however, more recent data suggests that this may not always be the case  <cit> . indeed, there is now mounting evidence which challenges the idea that second generation designs are improvements on standard shrnas  <cit> .

rather than longer hairpins , our results show that shorter hairpins  may be better for generating single products. this could have the added advantage of reducing competition  with natural small rnas involved in cell regulation - a commonly voiced concern when 'hijacking' the rnai pathway  <cit> . moreover, it is possible that of all stem lengths, those shorter than  <dig> bp are the least likely to induce non-specific effects  <cit> . however, as we noted, 81% of hairpins currently designed with  <dig> bp stems actually have  <dig> bp stems due to a collapsing loop. if our findings hold true, then ~ 85% of studies are using hairpins that yield more products than their shorter counterparts. these products may differ by only  <dig> or  <dig> bases but we, and others, have shown that minor sequence changes even as small as  <dig> -  <dig> bases can have large effects on suppressive activity  <cit> . furthermore, it is possible that the products of  <dig> and  <dig> bp stems incorporate additional sequence derived from the loop or flanking regions  <cit> . optimal use of short hairpins requires extra consideration of the structure and composition of the loop, and possibly flanking sequence. the presence of multiple products, the potential incorporation of extra-stem sequence and the unequal processing of the entire stem length may, in-part, explain why it is often difficult to retain sirna activity when constructing the corresponding shrna.

in addition to stem length and core placement, there are also several other shrna-specific variables that have recently been reported on. the work of li et. al., asking some similar questions to those here and extensively comparing short and long shrnas, supports our findings by also showing that shorter hairpins can be highly effective silencers  <cit> . they also looked at loop sequence and the influence that loop size has on suppressive activity. they concluded that short loops of  <dig> nt. may curtail the activity of otherwise effective core sequences. longer loops of ~  <dig> nt. were shown to be generally more effective - though, most importantly, it should be noted that their 'longer'  <dig> nt. loop was the collapsing type. this is most interesting, as in-effect their 'shorter' shrnas may have been ~  <dig> bp stems with only a  <dig> nt. loop - not 'truly' short hairpins nor 'longer' loops by our definitions. others also report that the suppressive activities of shorter hairpins  may be more susceptible to the negative effects of shorter loops than those of longer stem lengths   <cit> . these findings are interesting and warrant further investigation, especially given that our survey indicates that the majority of studies may be using short loop sizes of ~  <dig> nt. finally, asymmetric strand biasing is yet another design parameter which has recently been shown to influence resulting suppressive activity, and therefore one which should also be carefully considered in shrna constructions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we found that although the processing of a hairpin is dependent on its stem length, the activity of a hairpin is primarily dependent on the sequence of its processed product. the comparison of hairpins shorter or longer than  <dig> bp loses meaning when considering that it is most likely a comparison of different sirnas. we conclude that there is no fixed correlation between stem length and suppressive activity, though in some cases the activity of hairpins of at least  <dig> bp may be improved by stem extensions. from a purely activity point-of-view, neither short nor long hairpins should be discounted as potentially potent suppressors. there may, however, be some other advantages to using shorter hairpins  over longer ones . instead of stem length though, it is sirna core design and placement that are most likely to have the greatest influence on ensuing suppressive activity.
