BACKGROUND
the development of high throughput snp genotyping assays has radically changed the genetic dissection of complex traits in human, model organisms, and agricultural species. in farm animals, for many years, such studies were focused on linkage mapping in experimental crosses with the highly variable microsatellites as the markers of choice. more recently with the development of high-density snp chips for various farm animal species such as cattle <cit> , sheep  <cit> , horses and pigs  <cit> , these studies are increasingly being replaced by whole genome association studies. although, the chicken was the first farm animal whose genome was completely sequenced  <cit>  and for which large numbers of snps have been publically available for many years  <cit> , the development of a high density snp chip has not yet been described.

nevertheless, numerous studies have used smaller scale snp assays in chicken, in particular based on illumina's goldengate assay  <cit> . these studies have clearly demonstrated the high validation rate of snps identified by wong et al.  <cit> . however, in that study snps were identified by comparing the sequence of individual birds against the reference genome and no allele frequencies are available for these snps. furthermore, the chicken genome assembly covers only  <dig> of the bird's  <dig> chromosomes and snps covering the chromosomes not represented by the current genome build are not well represented by the snps currently available. lastly, while conversion rates from wong et al.  <cit>  have proven to be high, 50% or less are typically segregating in any single population depending on its origin and inbreeding. our objective therefore, was to design a moderate density snp chip in chicken consisting of snps known to be segregating at high to medium allele frequencies in the two major types of commercial chicken  with snps covering all chicken chromosomes and to optimize the number of segregating snps for maximum utility across breeds. we used reduced representation libraries  in combination with next generation sequencing  technology for the identification of snps including their minor allele frequencies  in different commercial populations. to further increase the high utility of the chip we also identified snps on sequences currently not covered by the chicken genome assembly . this resulted in a total number of  <dig>  snps. we then added  <dig> snps that mapped to 454-derived contigs,  <dig> snps with a position on chr_random  and  <dig> snps located on the mitochondrial genome for a grand total of  <dig>  snps.

RESULTS
the chicken reference genome
the snp discovery strategy used is based on aligning short read sequences against a reference genome in order to identify variable sites  <cit> . the high sequence depth obtained by using ngs technology allows high confidence calling of snps and also enables estimates of maf by counting the occurrence of the two variants. in the case of chicken, the most recent genome build is gallus_gallus- <dig>  . this genome build covers an estimated 95% of the chicken genome, but because markers did not identify sequence in the wgs data for the  <dig> smallest micro-chromosomes, we believe these sequences are still not available. in order to obtain sequences from these micro-chromosomes, the roche  <dig> flx sequencing platform was used to re-sequence the genome of the same bird  from which previous chicken genome builds were derived  <cit> . since underrepresentation of the micro-chromosomes in these previous genome builds was attributed to high gc composition and cloning bias in e. coli  <cit> , it was assumed that a better representation of the chicken genome could be obtained from the  <dig> platform as its successful use was described in human  <cit> . a total of 12x genome coverage of  <dig> sequences were assembled with newbler  and non-aligned contigs to the gallus_gallus- <dig>  assembly were identified. this amounted to  <dig>  supercontigs with a total length of  <dig>  mb, the majority of which  is smaller than 1kb in length. a total of  <dig>  contigs with a total length of  <dig>  mb partially overlapped with sequences on chromosomes unassigned and w. we decided to only use the sequence contigs larger than  <dig> bp. setting a threshold of  <dig> bp these contigs were concatenated and added to the reference genome as an additional artificial chromosome,  <dig> mb in size. by including these additional sequences in the snp discovery, we anticipated identifying snps located on the micro-chromosomes that were not yet covered by genome build gallus_gallus- <dig> .

snp discovery
to obtain a large collection of snps and their maf in a collection of broiler and layer breeds, we constructed  <dig> different reduced representation libraries  from  <dig> distinct chicken populations; two broiler type chickens  and a brown  and white layer line . each of these was sequenced at an intended 25-40x sequence depth. based on the size distribution of restriction fragments in the size range of 125- <dig> bp, we used the restriction enzyme alui for the construction of the libraries. we aimed for a genome coverage of around 2% and a sequence depth of 25x. initially we isolated fragments in the size range from 150- <dig> bp , which resulted in genome coverage of around  <dig> % and a sequence depth of 45x. for the broiler lines  we therefore increased the size range of the fragments to be sequenced to 125- <dig> bps, which resulted in a genome coverage of  <dig> % and sequence depth of 37x for b <dig> and a genome coverage of  <dig> % and sequence depth of 18x for b <dig>  in total, we generated  <dig> , <dig> quality approved  <dig> bp paired end sequences and after further filtering the sequences ,  <dig> , <dig> sequences were used to align against the chicken reference genome described above and for subsequent snp identification. snp identification was performed with maq  <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  essentially as described previously  <cit> .

snp identification was done separately for each of the  <dig> lines  after which the results were combined. after applying stringent filtering criteria, in particular that both variants should have been observed at least three times each, a total of  <dig>  snps were identified. about half  of these snps were detected in at least two of the breeds and  <dig>  were already present in dbsnp release  <dig>  the number of snps identified in the  <dig> different lines is shown in table  <dig>  the average maf of the snps identified is  <dig>  and the maf spectrum of the snps shows a rather flat distribution with the majority of the snps showing high mafs .

the number on the diagonal is the number of snps identified in that particular population the other numbers show the number of snps that are in common between any pair of populations

recently over  <dig> , <dig> additional snps were identified by rubin et al.,  <cit>  located on chromosomes 1- <dig> and  <dig>  comparison of the  <dig>  snps located on the chromosomes covered by the submission of rubin et al.  showed that around 50% of our snps  were common to the two sets. a comparison of the  <dig>  million snps identified by wong et al.,  <cit> , excluding indels and snps on the z chromosomes, with the snps identified by rubin et al.  <cit>  shows that 62% of the snps identified by wong et al  <cit>  are present in the rubin et al  <cit>  data set.

snp selection and chip design
to maximize the number of snps on the chicken iselect chip to be designed, we decided to only include infinium type ii snps  because these snps require only a single bead type on the chip  <cit> . the number of infinium type ii snps within the total number of  <dig>  snps identified was  <dig> . a second strict criterion used to increase the success rate of the snps on the chip was that the snps had to have an illumina design score of at least  <dig> . the illumina design score  reflects the ability to design a successful assay. this further reduced the number of snps available for the final selection to  <dig> . similar criteria were used to select snps from dbsnp for the final snp selection resulting in  <dig> , <dig> snps. because both sources, the illumina snp set and the dbsnp set, had  <dig>  snps in common, the total number of snps used for the selection of the snps for the illumina bead chip was  <dig> , <dig> 

from this final list we selected  <dig>  snps to be included on the illumina iselect beadchip. these  <dig>  snps were selected based on a priority score as described in the material and methods. the combination of the different criteria  resulted in a total of  <dig> priority classes. for example, snps that had previously been validated in an illumina genotyping assay and that had a high maf were given the highest priority during the selection process, whereas snps from dbsnp that had not previously been used and therefore no maf was available were given the lowest priority. the final step of the selection process was to scroll along the individual chromosomes and to select snps with the highest priority value at regular distances along the chromosome. the spacing of the snps on the different chromosomes was varied based on the size of the chromosome . this resulted in a total number of  <dig>  snps. we then added  <dig> snps that mapped to 454-derived contigs,  <dig> snps with a position on chr_random  and  <dig> snps located on the mitochondrial genome . the final distribution of the spacing between the snps selected for the 60k iselect chip is shown in figure  <dig> 

performance of the chicken 60k iselect beadchip
of the  <dig>  snps submitted to illumina to be included on the iselect beadchip, a total of  <dig>  were eventually retained for the analysis. to evaluate the performance of the illumina chicken iselect beadchip, the  <dig>  markers that passed the assay design tool informatics screen was used to genotype a range of individuals representing a wide variety of breeds. these included several commercial broiler and layer lines as well as dutch fancy breeds and two different populations of the red jungle fowl. based on assay design and performance all  <dig>  were grouped in one of the following four classes:  "failed" or those snps that did not pass the illumina assay design thresholds,  "excluded" or snps that were excluded after detailed evaluation of the clustering results; the majority of snps within this group either could not be unequivocally clustered in the three genotype classes or consisted of only heterozygotes,  "monomorphic" or snps for which only a single allele was observed, and most likely representing false positive snps from the original snp discovery process, or  "polymorphic", snps for which both alleles were observed in at least one of the breeds examined.

to evaluate the snp discovery process, snps were also classified based on the procedure used for snp discovery , limiting the mapping resolution, the total number of snps used  guarantees a high power to observe linkage between multiple markers and thus, results in a high power to map unmapped snps. of the  <dig> unmapped snps,  <dig> could be assigned to a chromosomal location or to a new linkage group . seventy-seven of the  <dig> snps from chr_random could be positioned on a chromosome, and all of these, except the snps from chr25_random, mapped to specific locations on the expected chromosomes. the snps that previously were assigned to chr25_random, all map to the linkage group for chromosome  <dig> 

the majority of the  <dig> snps derived from the  <dig> sequence contigs, map to chromosomes that were already represented in genome build gallus_gallus- <dig> . <dig> and only  <dig> snps map to two new linkage groups . a third new linkage group  was obtained and consists of  <dig> snps previously located on chre64_random,  <dig> snps from chrw_random, and  <dig> snps derived from  <dig> sequence contigs.

to further evaluate the new linkage groups, we aligned the sequences of the  <dig> contigs with the snps that map to these linkage groups to the human genome. the  <dig> contigs of  <dig> of the snps located on linkage groups lg <dig> and lg <dig> aligned to the human genome. two contigs aligned to sequences on human chromosome 19q <dig>  three to human 17q, and three to human 12q <dig> 

discussion
the illumina chicken 60k snp beadchip described in this paper was shown to contain a large percentage  of snps that are segregating in a variety of chicken breeds and that can reliably be genotyped. our approach to identify a large number of new snps and to determine their maf was shown to be a very efficient, cost effective approach in the design of the chip. although, previous results  <cit>  had already shown that the conversion rate of a large proportion of the snps identified by wong et al.  <cit>  was very high, the conversion rate of the snps identified by our approach surpassed those identified by wong et al.  <cit> . of the new snps identified in this study, more than 96% could be validated, whereas only 86% of the snps present in dbsnp could be validated. to some extent this likely is due to the selection of snps with a high maf using our illumina sequencing approach. nevertheless, it also reflects the power of the high sequence depth  that was obtained using our rrl-illumina sequencing approach as compared to the low sequence depth  generally obtained using classical sanger sequencing  <cit> .

this high sequence depth allowed stringent filtering criteria reducing the number of false positive snps even though the percentage of sequencing errors in the illumina sequence is much higher compared to sequences obtained by sanger sequencing. likewise, the ability to estimate maf due to the large number of haplotypes sequenced, enabled the selection of common snps and the exclusion of rare snps. this is not possible in cases where only two or three haplotypes are sequenced. our results clearly show that with the current low sequencing costs of massive parallel sequencing techniques, a snp identification step is recommended even in situations where a large number of snps is already available. in particular, the additional information of the estimated maf strongly improves the usefulness of the final product . finally, as expected, the majority of the snps that earlier had been used in other genotyping assays and that were included on the chip were validated in our study .

a second important criterion for a whole genome genotyping assay is the uniform distribution of the snps across the genome, as this greatly facilitates finding associations between markers and phenotypes. in our chip design, therefore, much emphasis was placed on the location of the snps during the snp selection phase of the project. important in this respect is the availability of a large collection of snps to choose from during the design of the chip. as a rule of thumb, the number of snps should be at least 10-fold higher than the targeted number for the final chip. this allows the inclusion of further criteria in addition to the spacing criterion. because of the much higher recombination rate of the micro-chromosomes, we targeted a 4-fold higher snp density on the micro-chromosomes. based on ld analysis of a variety of chicken populations from previous studies  <cit>  and results obtained with the 60k chip, we would advise an even larger difference  in snp density on the micro-chromosomes-compared to the macro-chromosomes for future snp chip design in chicken and other birds.

finally, the third important criterion for a whole genome snp assay is the complete coverage of the genome. although this might seem trivial, for chicken  this offers additional difficulties and challenges. for all the birds whose genome has been sequenced so far , it has proven to be extremely difficult to obtain a good uniform coverage of the genome. although the reason is still not known, sequences representing the smallest micro-chromosomes are highly underrepresented in the available genome assemblies. we aimed to solve this problem by sequencing the chicken genome at a depth of >12x using a second generation sequencing approach . we obtained > <dig> mb of sequences that were not covered by assembly gallus_gallus- <dig> , which is based completely on traditional sanger sequences. however, of the  <dig> snps that are derived from these sequences, only  <dig> could be assigned to two new linkage groups, likely representing two of the micro-chromosomes still missing from the current assembly. surprisingly, the majority of the snps derived from these sequences map to chromosomes already represented in the current genome build. this highlights that even the better assembled chromosomes within assembly gallus_gallus- <dig>  contain underrepresented regions. moreover, the underrepresentation of the micro-chromosomes in genome assemblies does not seem to stem solely from a cloning bias but rather appears to point to a feature of the micro-chromosomes that affects 454-based sequencing as well. it was suggested  <cit>  that the higher gc content or  repeats might contribute to the absence of the micro-chromosomes from the assembly. interestingly, sequences from the smallest micro-chromosomes are also under represented in illumina based sequences from turkey  <cit> .

in total,  <dig> snps derived from the  <dig> sequence contigs were assigned a chromosomal location, allowing further improvement of future genome builds for chicken. the same applies to the  <dig> snps from chr_random that could be assigned to a specific location on the linkage map. the new snps do increase the fraction of the genome that is covered by the 60k chip and they allow the analysis of two putative additional chicken chromosomes. previously, it was shown  <cit>  that specific regions e.g. regions syntenic to human chromosomes  <dig> were underrepresented in the chicken genome assembly. mapping two contigs of the new linkage groups to this region on human chromosome  <dig> is strong support that indeed these syntenic regions are located on micro-chromosomes in birds. the improvement of the coverage of future  snp chips, in particular the coverage of the missing micro-chromosomes, clearly remains a huge challenge for birds. improving our understanding of which syntenic regions in non-bird species may map to bird micro-chromosomes is therefore important for ultimately understanding why these sequences are so difficult to obtain in birds. the involvement of cloning  or pcr  steps in combination with specific sequence features of the micro-chromosomes likely underlie this difficulty. therefore, new sequencing technologies based on single molecule sequencing might offer further opportunities to eventually obtain a genome build and snp chip that in actuality covers the vast majority of the chicken genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the high success rate of the snps on the illumina chicken 60k beadchip emphasizes the power of next generation sequence  technology for the snp identification and selection step. the identification of snps from sequence contigs derived from ngs sequencing resulted in improved coverage of the chicken genome and the construction of two new linkage groups most likely representing two chicken micro-chromosomes.
