BACKGROUND
shiga toxin-producing e. coli  can cause serious human infections ranging from uncomplicated watery diarrhea to bloody diarrhea, up to the hemolytic uremic syndrome , including neurological complications  <cit> . the production of shiga toxins  is considered to be the major virulence factor of stec  <cit> . in addition to the production of stx, the generation of histopathological lesions on host enterocytes, termed attaching and effacing lesions, which are caused by proteins encoded on the locus of enterocyte effacement  can lead to serious symptoms of disease  <cit> . the intimin-encoding e. coli attaching and effacing  gene is located on the lee. intimin is involved in the intimate attachment of stec to the enterocytes, and the corresponding eae gene has been used as a marker for the presence of the lee  <cit> . in contrast, eae-negative e. coli of various serotypes were described to cause serious diseases. examples of these are the outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome  caused by a stec strain of serotype o113:h <dig> in south australia in  <dig>  <cit> , and more recently, the serious outbreak of diarrhea and hus in germany in  <dig> with stec of serotype o104:h <dig>  <cit> . such strains may harbor other important virulence markers than the lee. whereas the o104:h <dig> outbreak strain had an enteroaggregative e. coli backbone, the o113:h <dig> outbreak strain expressed a subtilase cytotoxin  with cytotoxic and apoptotic properties, in addition to stx  <cit> . paton et al.  <cit>  described this novel ab <dig> cytotoxin occurring in the eae-negative stec o113:h <dig> outbreak strain. this toxin caused cell death in a number of animal and human cells and enhanced survival of pathogenic e. coli strains in macrophages  <cit> . the initially described subtilase cytotoxin subab is encoded by the closely linked suba and subb genes organized in an operon structure on the megaplasmid po <dig>  <cit> . the stec autoagglutinating adhesion saa is also located on po <dig>  close to the subab operon  <cit> .

this subtilase cytotoxin consists of a single enzymatic active a-subunit  and five receptor binding b-subunits . suba comprises  <dig> amino acids and contains the catalytic triad asp- <dig>  his- <dig>  and ser- <dig> typical of subtilase family serine proteases  <cit> . the subb protein is  <dig> amino acids in length and responsible for the receptor mediated cellular uptake. suba is a serine protease cleaving the chaperone grp78/bip in the endoplasmatic reticulum   <cit> . this leads to an unfolded protein response and er stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that subab confers hus-like symptoms in mice  <cit> . subb has a high binding specificity for α2-3-linked n-glycolylneuraminic acid , and a lower binding specificity to α2-3-linked n-acetylneuraminic acid   <cit> . human cells are not able to synthesize neu5gc but can generate high affinity receptors when incubated with this molecule  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that ingestion of neu5gc rich diet will confer susceptibility to the subab toxin  <cit> .

besides the plasmid-located subab  operon, a chromosomal variant was described in  <dig> by tozzoli et al.  <cit> . this variant  showed only  <dig> % sequence identity to the plasmid-located one but was also able to cause cytotoxic effects on vero cells  <cit> . the chromosomal subab <dig> variant has been recently shown to be harbored on a genomic island. this  <dig> bp subtilase-encoding pai , is positioned between the trna gene phev and the yjhs gene, putatively encoding an 9-o-acetyl n-acetylneuraminic acid esterase in e. coli strain ed <dig>  the se-pai contains an integrase gene, a shia gene , a sulphatase, the toxigenic invasion locus a  and the subab operon  <cit> .

several authors described the presence of subab mainly in eae-negative stec strains of non-o <dig> serogroups such as o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  <cit> , serotype o128:h <dig> from sheep  <cit> , and a number of other stec from various origins  <cit> . but human cases of infection have also been described  <cit> .

the aim of the current study was to characterize the subab genes and their genetic surrounding in a collection of  <dig> subab-positive food-borne stec strains in order to get a more detailed understanding of gene variability, genetic structure, and location.

molecular methods
purification of the large stec plasmids was performed according to kado et al.  <cit> , with minor modifications. chromosomal dna was prepared according to standard methods  <cit> . concentration and purity of plasmid and chromosomal dna was measured by uv–vis spectrophotometry using a nanodrop  <dig> device .

for detection of the subab operon on chromosomal or plasmid dna, a  <dig> bp dna probe spanning the suba and subb gene region was generated by pcr with a roche pcr dig probe synthesis kit  using the primer pair subab-v-for and subab-v-rev . strain ts30/ <dig> was used as a template for subab <dig> and strain lm27558stx <dig> was used for subab <dig> with the same primer pair. the specificity of the probes were tested by hybridization of the probes with subab genes cloned in vector pk <dig>  <cit>  . the purified chromosomal and plasmid dna of subab-positive strains was separated on a  <dig> % agarose gel with  <dig> v at 4°c for  <dig> h. subsequently, dna was transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane by vacuum blotting  at  <dig> mbar, then treated with a 1%  blocking solution  and hybridized at 73°c for  <dig> hours. the detection protocol was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction using sheep anti-digoxigenin-ap fab fragments .

pcr-screening, sequencing and sequence analysis
characterization, and sequencing of subab alleles as well as the presence of saa or tia genes were determined by amplification with the oligonucleotides shown in table  <dig>  dna sequence analysis of subab open reading frames was carried out by capillary sequencing using a ceq™  <dig> genetic analysis system  and the ceq dye terminator cycle sequencing  quick start kit  according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. final dna sequences were obtained by sequencing both complementary strands with an at least two-fold coverage. oligonucleotides for sequencing were created using the oligo-explorer ver.  <dig> . <dig> software  using nucleotide sequences of e. coli strains 98nk <dig> , ed <dig> , and  <dig>   from the ncbi database. the same sequences were used as reference sequences for phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparison. the obtained sequences for all subab alleles were submitted to the ebi database and achieved consecutive accession no. from #hg <dig> - #hg <dig>  editing of raw data and sequence-alignments were carried out using bioedit, version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the different suba genes was conducted using mega  <dig>  with an upgma algorithm  <cit> .

RESULTS
genomic localization of subab genes
in order to characterize the subab genes of  <dig> food-borne stec from a previous study, which were positive by pcr targeting a fragment of the subab operon  <cit> , they were initially analyzed for the presence and genetic location of their complete orf. by purification and gel electrophoresis of plasmid dna of all  <dig> stec strains, it could be demonstrated that all strains carried plasmids of various sizes . sixteen strains carried large plasmids with molecular weights larger than that of plasmid po <dig> of e. coli o157:h <dig> strain edl <dig> . southern blot hybridization with a specific dna probe directed to subab <dig>  showed that  <dig> strains carried subab <dig> on a large plasmid . none of the other strains reacted with the probe . southern blot hybridization of chromosomal dna preparations  reacted with a probe directed to subab <dig> and demonstrated chromosomal localization of subab <dig> in the other  <dig> strains .

pcr analysis of subab and adjacent dna regions
all stec strains were analyzed by pcr with specific primers directed to the subab operon or flanking regions of the two recently described subab alleles  <cit>  . pcr-products were confirmed by dna-sequencing. for the detection of plasmid-located subab <dig>  primer pair subab-for5/subab-rev <dig>  was used to amplify the complete orf, including a region  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream of subab <dig>  the nine strains with plasmid-located subab <dig> yielded a pcr product of the expected size of  <dig> bp, indicating the presence of the subab <dig> variant and complete orfs in these strains . moreover, saa was present in these strains indicating a similar genetic arrangement as previously described  <cit> .

since it has been reported that the chromosomal subab <dig> variant of stec strain ed <dig> was linked to the tia gene in the chromosomal island se-pai  <cit> , corresponding primers were used to test the hypothesis whether the remaining  <dig> strains contained this particular variant . in initial experiments pcr with primers tia_lo and tia_sense  was positive in all nine strains and proved the presence of the tia gene. however, pcr products of strains lm27553stx <dig> and lm27553stx <dig> were larger than expected, indicating insertion of foreign dna into or closely to the tia gene  <cit>  .

following this, the structure of the subab <dig> operon and adjacent dna was analyzed using the primer pair tia_lo/ subab2-3′tia targeting the region of the tia gene, an intergenic region , subab <dig>  as well as  <dig> bp of the downstream region . this should reveal a pcr product of  <dig> bp. in these pcrs,  <dig> stec strains were positive , indicating the presence of subab <dig> linked to the tia gene . however, one of these pcrs with strain lm27553stx <dig> as a template, revealed a pcr product of approximately  <dig> bp . since the open reading frames of suba2- <dig> and subb2- <dig> in this strain were of the correct size, insertion of foreign dna between suba2- <dig> and tia is assumed. pcr of stec strains lm14603/ <dig>  lm16092/ <dig> and lm27553stx <dig> with the same primers was negative , and therefore direct association of subab <dig> with the tia gene could not be demonstrated. weak bands in figure 3a, lanes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> reflect unspecific amplification products.

due to these negative results, the subab <dig> reference sequence of stec strain ed <dig>  was searched with blast against the ncbi nucleotide database to evaluate the possibility of further subab gene loci in these strains. interestingly, a further subab operon with different flanking regions was detected in escherichia coli strain  <dig>  in contig  <dig>  and in escherichia coli strain  <dig>  in contig  <dig> , which in addition carry the se-pai described by michelacci et al.  <cit> . the new gene locus carries genes hypothetically encoding parts of a type  <dig> secretion system , and an outer membrane efflux protein , which are located upstream of subab <dig> and are linked to the latter by a  <dig> bp sequence . downstream of subab <dig>  the nanr gene hypothetically encoding the transcriptional regulator of the nan-operon was present in a  <dig> bp distance in strain e. coli  <dig>  and  <dig> bp in e. coli  <dig>  where additional putative transposases are inserted . in the following, this new gene region is termed oep-locus.

to test the hypothesis whether in the stec strains investigated here also two copies of subab <dig> are present, oligonucleotides subab5′-oep and suba_out were designed  and used for pcr amplification of all subab2-positive strains. six strains were positive with these primers , including the strains lm14603/ <dig>  lm16092/ <dig> and lm27553stx <dig>  which were negative for the se-pai . moreover, this demonstrated that stec strains lm27553stx <dig>  lm <dig> and lm27558stx <dig> contained both chromosomal subab <dig> loci .

sequencing of subab open reading frames
in order to further prove that the subab operons contained complete orfs, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire subab open reading frames of the pcr products derived from the three different gene loci. results of the dna sequencing complied with the pcr data , and confirmed the presence of three loci encoding different alleles of subab. the different alleles of the chromosomal loci were designated subab2- <dig> for the one located in the se-pai and subab2- <dig> for the new variant located in the oep-locus. the sequence of the nine subab <dig> operons was identical and comprised  <dig> bp from the start codon of suba <dig> to the last base of the stop codon of subb <dig>  sequences were  <dig> % identical to the corresponding subab operon sequence of strain 98nk <dig> published by paton et al.  <cit> .

in all  <dig> chromosomal dna sequences the a-subunit genes had the same length as the suba <dig> genes described above and that from reference strain 98nk <dig>  all but one subb <dig> genes had the same length as the reference sequence of ed <dig> but were one triplet shorter at the 3′-end of the gene, than subb <dig>  this resulted in the lack of the n-terminal amino acid serine in the putative subb2-subunits.

moreover, the subb2- <dig> sequence of strain lm27553stx <dig> contained an insertion of a single thymine; generating a stretch of  <dig> t’s at position 1298– <dig>  which was not present in the subb <dig> alleles of the other strains. this resulted in a frame shift in the b-subunit gene, and thereby to a stop codon at position  <dig> of the orf. this putatively results in a truncated protein of  <dig> amino acids instead of  <dig> amino acids as for the full length subb <dig> subunits.

phylogenetic analysis of all  <dig> a-subunit genes clearly demonstrated three clusters . cluster  <dig> comprises the very homogeneous suba <dig> genes, cluster  <dig> the suba2- <dig> genes, including the reference sequence of ed <dig>  and cluster  <dig> the suba2- <dig> genes located in the oep-locus. in cluster  <dig> there is a single suba2- <dig> allele located on the oep-locus .

comparing the whole subab sequences of  <dig> bp , the subab2- <dig> sequences of cluster  <dig>  including subab2- <dig> of strain lm <dig> were  <dig> % identical to each other. the sequence identities of subab2- <dig> to the reference strain ed <dig> were in a range of  <dig> - <dig> % for the other subab2- <dig> alleles.

the subab2- <dig> sequences of the oep-locus without strain lm <dig>  were  <dig> % identical to each other and showed sequence homologies of about  <dig> % to subab <dig>  moreover, subab2- <dig> is  <dig> % identical to subab2- <dig> and  <dig> % to the reference sequence of the oep-locus of e. coli  <dig>  .

the subab2- <dig> genes of the oep-locus of strain lm <dig> showed  <dig> % sequence identity to subab2- <dig> of strain ed <dig> and only  <dig> % with subab <dig> of strain 98nk <dig> and  <dig> % to the oep-locus of e. coli strain  <dig> . the results of these sequence comparisons show that the sequences of the three alleles are conserved but heterogeneity is present between the loci.

discussion
the results of this study have shown that those  <dig> food-borne stec, which have previously been demonstrated to be subab-positive by pcr  <cit>  carry complete subab open reading frames. besides the plasmid-locus, as originally described by paton et al.  <cit> , and the se-pai described by michelacci et al.  <cit> , a new chromosomal region, the oep-locus, was present in six strains analyzed here and demonstrated to harbor subab2- <dig> operons.

it could be shown that all strains contained at least intact open reading frames for one subab operon, and the codons specifying the amino acids constituting the catalytic triad were present in all cases . from the sequence data obtained in our study, it can be concluded that all strains are able to produce functional subab subtilase cytotoxins.

the stec strains analyzed in our study with subtilase-encoding plasmids did not carry chromosomal subab genes and vice versa. up to now we do not know whether this is a basic principle or whether this is only observed in our small strain collection. however, we cannot rule out that chromosomal-encoded and plasmid-encoded subab genes exclude each other or that recombination between plasmids and the chromosome in subab-carrying strains is low. phylogenetic analyses of the suba genes clearly differentiated three clusters, the plasmid-located being the most homogeneous one. the chromosomal clusters showed more genetic diversity, indicating a different phylogenetic history . these phylogenetic differences could reflect a different pathogenic potential and toxicity of subab-positive strains for humans as it was shown for the different shiga toxin variants  <cit> . therefore, it could be important to analyze the enzymatic and toxic activity of the variants in different cell culture and animal models. moreover, it could be important to analyze which subab variants are associated with serious diseases and whether further variants exist, which currently have not been described.

in a former study, it could be shown that the  <dig> strains used here carried gene fragments of the subtilase cytotoxin  <cit> . these strains were isolated from different food-sources and showed a high serotype heterogeneity demonstrating the wide spread of subab in stx-positive e. coli. genetic analysis of these strains demonstrated that the chromosomal encoded subab2-positive strains were all associated with deer meat, whereas the plasmid encoded subab <dig> could be found in strains from different sources. this association of the chromosomal encoded subab <dig> variant with deer was also described in other studies  <cit>  and suggests the possibility of small ruminants as reservoir for subab <dig> positive stec.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our analysis have confirmed that subab should be further considered as a marker for virulence, especially in food-borne stec strains. the occurrence of more than one subab allele in particular strains is interesting and raises the question whether multiple gene acquisitions may bear a selective advantage for those strains. the fact that subtilase cytotoxin-producing escherichia coli have not been frequently involved in outbreaks of human disease could be a hint for a function in other hosts such as small ruminants. increased detection of subab in such animals supports this assumption. however, cell culture and animal experiments have shown profound toxic effects on primary human epithelial cells  <cit> . therefore, future studies are necessary to investigate the function and expression of the different subab alleles in more detail.
