BACKGROUND
according to world health organization  more than 80% of the world's populations in developing countries depend primarily on herbal medicine for basic healthcare needs  <cit> . salvinia natans is a free floating, rootless aquatic fern and belongs to the family salvinaceae. ferns of the genus salvinia comprise of ten species; majority of which grow in freshwater bodies of tropical and subtropical regions, mainly in africa and south america  <cit> . salvinia varieties have small hairs on their leaves, making them water resistant. air cavities in the leaves help the tiny plant to stay afloat. for many years, aquatic plants were used as an effective strategy for decontaminating waste water. salvinia natans was found to have a great potentiality for the removal of heavy metals like lead , cadmium , nickel , copper , chromium  and mercury  from waste water. the understanding of chemistry of salvinia plants can help controlling their invasive growth, and promote their utilization for useful purposes  <cit> . the phytochemical investigation on s. natans showed that it consists of 96% of amino compounds  <cit> . though it is used in homeopathy and other systems of medicine, no reports on medicinally important phytochemical compounds isolated from salvinia natans. several reports indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the dietary intake of antioxidant-rich foods and the incidence of human diseases  <cit> . hence search for new synthetic and natural antioxidants is essentially important. for the present study, the plants were collected from the chidambaram area of tamilnadu, india. plants were collected in the month of november,  <dig>  prof. r. pannerselvam, department of botany, annamalai university, annamalai nagar  <dig>  <dig>  tamilnadu, india, identified the plant. herbarium of the department of botany, annamalai nagar  <dig>  <dig>  tamil nadu, india. herbarium sheet number is  <dig>  in the present study, natansnin, a dibenzoyl glycoside was isolated from s.natans and found to have antioxidative properties.

ccl <dig> is a common industrial solvent which is well-known for its hepatotoxicity  <cit> . ccl <dig> is commonly used for free radical induced liver injury. liver is not the only target organ of ccl <dig> but it also effect several organs like kidneys, lungs, heart, testis, brain and blood  <cit> . through the investigation of acute ccl <dig> induced liver damage in animal models, it is now generally accepted that ccl <dig> toxicity results from bioactivation of ccl <dig> into trichloromethyl free radical by cytochrome p <dig> system in liver microsomes and consequently causes lipid peroxidation of membranes that leads to liver injury  <cit> . lipid peroxidation initiated by free radicals is considerably deleterious for cell membranes and implicated in a number of pathological conditions. in the present study we examined the protective efficacy of natansnin isolated from salvinia natans against ccl <dig> induced oxidative stress and cellular degeneration in rat liver.

reduced and oxidized glutathione levels were measured in liver homogenate from control, ccl <dig> and natansnin  treated rats. glutathione levels are expressed as μmoles per gram tissue. ratio = gsh-2/gssg.

natansnin restored activities of antioxidant enzymes: catalase and superoxide dismutase
the effect of ccl <dig> with and without the prior administration of natansnin on levels of catalase activity was shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of catalase decreased in both homogenate and mitochondria by  <dig> and 53% respectively in ccl <dig> treated rats. . but there is a significant increase in the catalase activity in both homogenate and mitochondria in rats administered with natansnin and ccl <dig> when compared to rats administered with only ccl <dig>  prior administration of natansnin at  <dig> mg/kg body wt protected them up to 35%  and 32%  and at  <dig> mg/kg body wt the protection was slightly better  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in homogenate and mitochondria respectively. there was no significant effect on catalase levels in rats administered with natansnin alone. the effect of ccl <dig> in the presence and absence of natansnin on the activity of superoxide dismutase is shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of superoxide dismutase decreased in homogenate, mitochondrial fragment and mitochondria by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively due to the effect of ccl <dig>  when compared to normal rats . there was a considerable increase in the activity of sod in all the fragments in rats fed with both concentrations of natansnin and ccl <dig>  when compared to rats administered with only ccl <dig>  the treatment of natansnin at lower dose  protected the animals by 25% , 32%  and 32%  and at higher dose  by 29% , 37%  and 36%  respectively. the activity of superoxide dismutase increased in natansnin treated rats, when compared to rats that were challenged with ccl <dig>  administration of natansnin alone did not show any change on sod levels when compared to control animals.

natansnin restored cellular degeneration induced by ccl4
paraffin wax sectioning and haematoxylin-eosin staining were performed for histopathological studies of rats. haematoxylin-eosin staining of control liver had normal cell morphology and is shown in figure 5a and 5b. the histoarchitecture of hepatic cells of ccl <dig> challenged rats is shown in figure 5c and 5d. the hepatic cells of natansnin and ccl <dig> treated rats are shown in figure 5e and 5f. when compared to the histoarchitecture of the hepatocytes of control animals, hepatocytes of ccl <dig> challenged rats revealed extensive damage, characterized by the disruption of lattice nature of the hepatocyte, damaged cell membrane, degenerated nuclei and increased fatty vacuolation. in group  <dig> and  <dig> rats , only minimal disruption of the hepatic cellular structure and less vacuolation were noticed. prior administration of natansnin decreased the cellular degeneration, compared to ccl <dig> treated hepatocytes. hepatocyte apoptosis in fixed liver specimens were analyzed by terminal dutp nick- end labeling  assay. tunel sections of control, ccl <dig> treated and natansnin and ccl <dig> treated rats are shown in figures 6a, b, c, d, e and 6f respectively. the number of tunel positive hepatocytes is more in ccl <dig> treated rats, when compared to controls indicating an increase in apoptotic degeneration of hepatocytes. apoptosis in ccl <dig> treated liver was identified by the brdu- fitc . brdu-fitc is incorporated into the dna breaks that were increased during free radical generation and apoptotic cell death pathway. elevated levels of fitc fluorescent hepatocytes indicate the increased apoptosis of ccl <dig> treated liver hepatocytes over the control. the number of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced in both the concentrations of natansnin and ccl <dig> treated rats  as evident from the decrease in tunel positive hepatocytes. prior administration of natansnin decreased the number of apoptotic cells, when compared to ccl <dig> challenged hepatocytes .

natansnin reduced the levels of apoptotic and inflammatory proteins
immunoblot analysis of caspase- <dig>  parp, cytochrome c, inos and cox- <dig> were performed in whole cell lysates of liver samples of all the animals. also, immunoblot analysis of bax and bid were performed in mitochondrial fractions of all liver samples. mitochondrial cytochrome c, detected as a single band of molecular mass  was increased in the whole cell lysate of ccl <dig> treated rats, compared to controls . densitometric analysis of this protein is shown in figure  <dig>  release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol is clearly noticed. immuno blot analysis of pro caspase- <dig>  and active caspase- <dig>  increased in ccl <dig> treated rats and densitometric analysis of this protein is also shown in figure  <dig>  immuno blot analysis of cleaved parp fragments  increased in ccl <dig> treated rats and also its densitometric analysis is shown in figure  <dig>  the cleavage of parp was clearly observed. the levels of these proteins were appreciably reduced in natansnin treated, compared to ccl <dig> exposed animals indicating a decrease in the cell death-signaling pathway. immuno blot analysis of apoptotic proteins like bax  and bid  in mitochondrial fractions of ccl <dig> treated rats revealed an increase and are shown in figure  <dig>  the immune blot analysis of inflammatory proteins inos  and cox- <dig>  considerably increased in ccl <dig> treated rats and are shown in figure  <dig>  the densitometric analyses of these proteins are also shown in figure  <dig>  natansnin treatment reduced the level of these inflammatory proteins. however, levels of these proteins reduced significantly in natansnin  treated rats, compared to ccl <dig> exposed ones indicating a decrease in the cell death.

discussion
ccl <dig> induced liver injuries are the best characterized system of xenobiotic-induced hepatotoxicity and for the screening of anti-hepatotoxic or hepatoprotective activities of drugs  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that prior administration of natansnin ameliorated ccl4-induced acute liver injury in rats as evidenced by both oxidative, cellular degeneration and cell death parameters mentioned above. indeed, several natural products were reported with their protective efficacy against ccl4-induced hepatotoxicity  <cit> . the medicinal herbs artemisia campestris  <cit>  and phyllanthus fraternus  <cit>  have been found to scavenge free radicals and therein to exert a hepatoprotective effect against ccl4-induced liver injury. free radicals, from both endogenous and exogenous sources, are implicated in the etiology of several degenerative diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and cancer  <cit> .

the basis of ccl <dig> hepatotoxicity lies in its biotransformation by the cytochrome p- <dig> system to two free radicals. the first metabolite, a trichloromethyl free radical   <cit>  has been formed from the metabolic conversion of ccl <dig> and reacts very rapidly with o <dig> and forms a second metabolite, a trichloromethyl peroxy free radical   <cit>  or abstract hydrogen atoms to form chloroform. these free radicals initiate the peroxidation of membrane poly-unsaturated fatty acids and covalently bind to microsomal lipids and proteins  <cit> . this phenomenon results in the generation of ros like the superoxide anion o2-, h2o <dig> and the hydroxyl radical, .oh. ros affect the antioxidant defense mechanisms, decrease the intracellular concentration of reduced glutathione  and reduces the activity of sod and cat.

in the present study, it was observed that intoxication of male wister rats with ccl <dig> caused a marked rise in the level of serum enzymes like alt and alp, lipid peroxides and oxidized glutathione and caused significant decrease in gsh, sod and cat activities in liver. prior treatment with natansnin displayed a profound effect. lipid peroxidation leading to cell membrane damage is known to occur in ccl <dig> induced hepatotoxicity  <cit> . membrane lipid peroxidation is an important pathophysiological event in a variety of diseases and stress conditions. mda is a major reactive aldehyde produced from the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the biological membranes  <cit> . it was hypothesized that ccl4- induced hepatotoxicity is mainly due to the lipid peroxidation of hepatocyte membranes by free radical derivatives of ccl <dig>  <cit> . the observation of elevated levels of hepatic mda in group  <dig> rats  in the present study is consistent with this hypothesis. natansnin at both concentrations brought down the elevated lipid peroxides which is of great value and provide an additional support to suggest the hepato-protective role of natansnin.

mitochondrial gsh depletion may compromise mitochondrial function and sensitizes cells to diverse oxidant-induced toxicity, leading to cell death  <cit> . liver injury included by consuming alcohol, by taking drugs like acetaminophen  <cit>  or toxic chemicals like ccl <dig> are all known to be correlated with low tissue levels of gsh. in our study we observed a fall in the levels of reduced glutathione  and a rise in levels of oxidized glutathione  in ccl <dig> challenged rats which are consistent with the results of other workers. prior treatment of natansnin at both concentrations increased the levels of gsh and decreased the levels of gssg when compared to ccl <dig> treated rats and these are close to the values obtained in controls. the ratio of gsh/gssg is significantly restored in natansnin treated rats. natansnin displayed hepatoprotection in natansnin treated rats with its antioxidant activity. in rats receiving ccl <dig> and natansnin, the activities of cat and sod were significantly higher than in ccl <dig> challenged rats, and are very similar to the values noted in normal rats. this suggests a hepatoprotective efficacy of natansnin, which is an interesting finding. the compound possibly confers this protective effect by diminishing the generation of free radicals induced by ccl <dig> 

histopathological studies were performed to provide direct evidence of the hepatotoxicity of ccl <dig>  marked disruption of the structure of hepatocytes was noted in liver tissue of group ii rats . stripp et al.,  <cit>  reported that lipids were accumulated abnormally in the liver of ccl <dig> induced hepatotoxic rats. the hepatoprotective effect of natansnin was supported by histological examination. only minimal disruption of the structure of hepatocytes was noted in liver tissue of rats exposed to ccl <dig> and natansnin. elevated levels of fitc fluorescent hepatocytes indicate the increased apoptosis of ccl <dig> treated liver hepatocytes over the control. the number of apoptotic cells were significantly reduced in both the concentrations of natansnin treated rats as evident by the decrease in tunel positive hepatocytes. liver has selective vulnerability to different toxins; hence we wanted to determine the mechanism of cell death in liver after ccl <dig> treatment. results of the current study revealed increased caspase-  <dig> activation and parp cleavage in ccl <dig> treated rats in comparison with controls. this indicates that the cell death mechanism involves caspase-  <dig> activation. in previous studies, loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c was correlated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria, which may contribute to cellular damage  <cit> . prior treatment of natansnin profoundly decreased the increased expression of caspase-  <dig>  parp cleavage and translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol indicating that natansnin decreases the apoptosis in hepatocytes. increased activation of bax and bid in ccl <dig> treated rats indicates apoptosis is more in these rats. prior treatment of natansnin  reduced the incidence of apoptosis by decreasing the activation of bax and bid. recent reports also demonstrated that induced nitric oxide overproduction occurs in the liver of rats with ccl4-induced acute liver injury suggested that inos may act as a mediator in the pathogenesis of hepatotoxicity in rats  <cit> . increased expression of cox- <dig>  a known inflammatory mediator and cancer has been observed in the present study. increased expression of cox- <dig> and inos indicate that there is a rise in inflammation in ccl <dig> treated rats. prior treatment of natansnin significantly reduced this inflammatory effect. the present study revealed that prior administration of natansnin  significantly decreased the ccl <dig> induced oxidative stress and cellular degeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrated that ccl <dig> induced a marked rise in oxidative stress and cellular degeneration in rat liver. both the doses of natansnin treatment  significantly ameliorated the effect of ccl <dig> induced oxidative stress damage and inhibited the expression of inflammatory and apoptotic proteins. this protective effect of natansnin can be correlated directly to its antioxidant property.
