BACKGROUND
the chicken is an important model organism for the large-scale analysis of vertebrate genome structure, function and evolution. the chicken shares most of its biology with mammals but, being evolutionarily distinct, it serves as a useful resource for the discovery of a wide range of biological processes  <cit> . the recent release of a draft chicken genome sequence has substantially increased our understanding of its genomic landscape and provided additional insight into the comparative analyses of the chicken and mammalian genomes  <cit> . the chicken has a relatively small genome of approximately  <dig> mb, roughly threefold smaller than that of mammalian genomes. surprisingly, less than 9% of the chicken genome contains transposable elements, compared with  <dig> to 50% in most mammals  <cit> . it is not yet known whether the low density of repetitive dna elements in the chicken is due to low transposable element activity or to a lack of active retrotransposons in the chicken genome. the mechanisms that control the activity and copy numbers of chicken transposable elements remain unclear.

the most abundant transposable elements in the chicken genome  belong to the cr <dig> families of line retrotransposons . the cr <dig> element resembles the mammalian l <dig> element in having a 5'utr, followed by two open reading frames  and a 3'utr. a full-length cr <dig> element is approximately  <dig>  kb in length. orf <dig> has potential to encode a nucleic acid-binding protein of approximately  <dig> kda containing a zinc-finger like motif; however, the exact function of orf <dig> is not yet known  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes a protein of approximately  <dig> kda with critical endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities as found in mammalian l1s, and is responsible for replication of the element. the majority of cr <dig> elements are truncated and mutated at their 5'ends, which is required for their transcription; nonetheless, there are a few copies of cr <dig> elements potentially capable of retrotransposition in the chicken genome  <cit> . remarkably, the 3'utr sequences of all cr <dig> subfamilies lack polyadenylated tails and instead contain two to four copies of a unique  <dig> bp  repeat  <cit> . interestingly, polyadenylated tails in mammals are potential substrates for l <dig> reverse transcriptase, probably explaining the abundance of processed pseudogenes in mammals compared with the chicken genome.

little is known about the activity and function of chicken cr <dig> elements. the first draft of chicken genome reveals that at least  <dig> cr <dig> elements have the potential to produce functionally active elements, implying a role for these elements in shaping the chicken genome  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> cr <dig> elements have been deposited in repbase . the chicken genome probably contains around  <dig>  copies of the cr <dig> element ) scattered throughout the genome. despite this high number, it has been a puzzle as how these elements are transcribed and maintained in the chicken genome  <cit> . given the low density of interspersed repeats in the chicken, mechanisms must exist to control the activity of cr <dig> retrotransposition. it remains to be elucidated how the copy number of transposons is controlled in the chicken genome and to what extent rnai-mediated silencing mechanisms contribute to the activity of cr <dig> elements.

rnai silencing machinery is highly conserved across eukaryotes. it may have initially evolved to defend the genome against invading transposable elements and other genomic parasites  <cit> . recent studies in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , drosophila  <cit>  and cultured human cells  <cit>  have shown that knockdown of rnai machinery increases transcript abundance of retrotransposable elements. these findings all suggest that there is ongoing control of retrotransposon proliferation in the host  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether such controlling mechanisms of retrotransposons are currently active in the chicken genome. to explore this hypothesis, we knocked down dicer gene expression in chicken dt <dig> cells and investigated the effects of sirnas on cr <dig> transcripts. here, we show that control of chicken cr <dig> is independent of the chicken rnai machinery. the depletion of chicken dicer did not result in increased expression of chicken cr <dig> elements. however, when we introduced human l <dig> elements into dt <dig> cells, in which dicer expression was reduced, a cell culture-based retrotransposition assay showed a marked increase in l <dig> expression and retrotransposition activity but not of endogenous chicken cr <dig> transposons.

RESULTS
a key step in the rna silencing pathway is the cleavage of double-stranded rna precursors by dicer to produce functional sirnas. in a number of organisms, sirnas have been implicated in silencing retrotransposable elements  <cit> . to understand the biological function of the rnai pathway against the chicken cr <dig> elements, we used a conditional loss-of-dicer function in a chicken-human hybrid dt <dig> cell line that containing a single copy of human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . a conditional knockout of dicer was generated in which a tetracycline-repressible promoter controlled the expression of dicer. in the presence of doxycycline , a gradual loss of dicer protein was observed, with complete loss  <dig> h after addition of dox . quantitative rt-pcr with primers specific for chicken dicer revealed that mrna levels were up to 92% lower in dox-induced dt <dig> cells than in the control cells . moreover, the dicer-deficient chicken cells survived for up to  <dig> days and their phenotype was almost indistinguishable from that of wild-type dt <dig> cells . to further confirm the loss of dicer function, we analysed the aberrant accumulation of transcripts from α-satellite dna repeats in dicer-deficient dt <dig> cells . consistent with previous research  <cit> , loss of dicer in chicken cells resulted in increased levels of transcripts from α-satellite sequences through the disruption of dicer-related rnai silencing machinery.

upregulation of mammalian l <dig> transcripts in dicer-deficient chicken cells
dicer-mediated gene silencing is an evolutionally conserved system across eukaryotes. previous studies in cultured human cells have identified that rnai machinery elicited by the antisense transcripts of l <dig> retrotransposons can suppress l <dig> expression and retrotransposition efficiency  <cit> . to demonstrate the direct role of chicken dicer in transposon silencing, and also to rule out the possibility that chicken may have multiple dicer enzymes  that are redundantly responsible for transposon-specific silencing, we used human chromosome  <dig> as a source of mammalian l <dig> elements in chicken-human hybrid dt <dig> cells. this system has two unique advantages: first, it allows us to study l <dig> expression from a natural chromosomal environment rather than from transfected plasmids; second, as human l <dig> sequences are completely different from chicken cr <dig> elements, it is easy to identify the transcript abundance of l <dig> retrotransposons by quantitative rt-pcr analysis without interference from chicken cr <dig> transposable elements.

human chromosome  <dig> contains  <dig> copies of a full-length l <dig> element determined by tblast and l1base searches  <cit>  using the consensus sequence of the active l <dig> element . although the majority of predicted l <dig> elements contain both orf <dig> and orf <dig>  all but one of them carry mutations and frame-shift interruptions or in-frame stop codons. only one copy of the l <dig> element in human chromosome  <dig>  appeared to be functional with an ability to produce both orfs active proteins. using real-time quantitative rt-pcr, we first compared the abundance of l <dig> transcripts in dicer-deficient and control dt <dig> cells. remarkably, dicer knockdown in chicken cells resulted in a significant increase  in the levels of both orf <dig> and orf <dig> transcripts derived from l <dig> element of human chromosome  <dig> . in addition, we also confirmed the increased expression of l <dig> transcripts upon loss of dicer by strand-specific rt-pcr analysis , suggesting that dicer may be required for silencing of human l <dig> retrotransposons. these data also imply that the dicer-mediated rnai silencing pathway is functional in chicken dt <dig> cells and enables them to control the levels of human l <dig> retrotransposons.

since dicer is a crucial component in the rnai pathway, which processes dsrna precursors to functional sirnas, loss of dicer may contribute to an increased expression of l <dig> transcripts due to the absence of, or poorly processed, sirnas against l <dig> elements. an equally important possibility is that loss of dicer also affects mirna processing, and thus the increased expression of l <dig> transcripts in the absence of dicer could be an effect of mirna dysregulation that targets l <dig> expression directly, or indirectly through mirna-mediated regulation of cellular factors that suppress l <dig> expression. although bona fide sirnas or mirnas that control the human l <dig> elements are yet to be isolated, a previous study in cultured human cells  <cit>  has shown that the dicer knockdown or deletion of l1's antisense promoter increases the levels of l <dig> expression, suggesting that the sirnas derived from the active l <dig> promoter control l <dig> expression. to confirm that the dicer knockdown in chicken cells affects l1-derived small rnas processing and thus the increased expression of l <dig> transcripts, we analysed the accumulation of small rnas in control and dicer-deficient dt <dig> cells . northern blot analysis shows reduced accumulation of l1-specific sirnas in dicer-depleted cells  compared with control cells, but not their complete absence, even though the level of dicer was almost completely lost  <dig> h after addition of dox. it is not clear whether the leftover small rnas in dicer-depleted cells are pre-existing sirnas or poorly processed sirnas upon the loss of dicer. nonetheless, this study shows that the reduced levels of l1-specific small rnas in dicer-deficient cells correlate with upregulation of the human l <dig> transcripts.

dicer knockdown activated mammalian l <dig> retrotransposition
to further confirm that the dicer is indeed required for controlling human l <dig> expression and retrotransposition, we introduced l <dig> expression cassettes harbouring a retrotransposition indicator for cell culture-based assay  <cit> . this cassette consists of a full-length human l <dig> tagged at its 3'utr with an antisense enhanced green fluorescent protein  gene, which is driven by a cytomegalovirus  promoter . the egfp gene is disrupted by a γ-globin intron in the same orientation as the l <dig> transcript. this arrangement ensures that egfp expression occurs only after l <dig> transcription, splicing of the intron, reverse-transcription, and insertion of the l <dig> copy back into chromosomal dna .

the chicken dt <dig> cells were electroporated with an active l <dig> element  and assayed for egfp expression in the presence or absence of dox. an inactive l <dig>  that contained two missense mutations in orf <dig>  <cit>  to abrogate retrotransposition activity was used as a negative control. cells expressing l <dig> were screened for egfp expression by flow cytometry in order to compare the l <dig> retrotransposition events between dicer-deficient and control dt <dig> cells. egfp-positive cells were not detected in any of the control cells, even after several passages; pcr analysis also confirmed the absence of the retrotransposed or spliced egfp in control cells . this observation suggests that no retrotransposition events occurred in the chicken cells that contained intact dicer and rnai pathways. strikingly, dicer knockdown in chicken cells resulted in a significant increase in egfp-positive cells  after  <dig> h addition of dox, indicating that dicer is indeed required for controlling the expression of human l <dig> elements. pcr analysis of chicken genomic dna also confirmed the splicing of the intron in the egfp gene in dicer-deficient cells; these cells remained egfp-positive for  <dig> days in culture and then ceased to proliferate upon loss of dicer and subsequently died before  <dig> days by apparent cell death or apoptosis  <cit> . furthermore, we also observed a correlation between the relative abundance of l <dig> transcripts and retrotransposition events by real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis . the level of l <dig> transcripts was almost doubled after dicer knockdown  suggesting that chicken dicer gives rise to an inhibitory effect on retrotransposition by reducing the levels of l <dig> transcripts, most probably via l1-derived sirnas.

dicer is not responsible for silencing of chicken cr <dig> transposons
if sirnas were responsible for controlling the copy numbers of chicken cr <dig> transposons, one would expect that depletion of sirnas by dicer knockdown would lead to a higher level of endogenous chicken cr <dig> transcripts in the chicken genome. to examine whether chicken dicer is responsible for processing sirnas acting against the chicken cr <dig> transposons, we used both strand-specific rt-pcr  and real-time quantitative rt-pcr to assess the transcript levels of cr1-b elements in dt <dig> cells in the presence or absence of dox for  <dig> days. unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in transcript accumulation of chicken cr <dig> elements in dicer-deficient cells compared with control dt <dig> cells . the mrna levels of both orf <dig> and orf <dig> of cr1-b elements in dicer-deficient and control dt <dig> cells were close to background levels, as determined by real-time quantitative rt-pcr . consistently, regardless of whether dicer was weakly or strongly depleted, dicer knockdown did not increase cr <dig> mrna levels . to further confirm this finding, we analysed transcript levels of the functionally active cr1-f element in chicken chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . again, we found a basal level of cr <dig> transcription that was similar in both control and dicer-deficient dt <dig> cells . these data were further confirmed by strand-specific rt-pcr analysis targeting the sense message of cr <dig> elements , suggesting that the dicer-related rnai machinery may not be responsible for controlling the endogenous chicken cr <dig> elements.

next, to determine whether the cr <dig> elements are able to produce any transcription, we transfected the chicken dt <dig> cells with luciferase reporter constructs whose expression is driven by either functionally active cr1-b 5'utr or l <dig> 5'utr as a promoter and performed the dual-luciferase assay with the renilla luciferase plasmid. in this way, we measured promoter activity in the presence or absence of dicer. as expected, transcript level of the human l <dig> 5'utr promoter in dicer-depleted dt <dig> cells was around twofold greater than that of control cells but not chicken cr1-b 5'utr promoter, whose level of expression was almost comparable to that of the control dt <dig> cells . this observation suggests that the chicken cr- <dig> elements may not be controlled by the dicer-mediated rnai pathway. interestingly, when we reprobed the northern blot of small rnas against the mixture of synthetic sense-strand cr1-b 5'utr sequences, we were not able to detect any cr1-specific antisense transcripts, regardless of whether the dicer was present or absent . this suggests that the cr <dig> promoter may not produce any sirnas like the human l <dig> 5'utr promoter. remarkably, according to the luciferase reporter assay, l <dig> promoter seems to be at least sixfold stronger than that of the cr <dig> element , indicating the existence of major differences between chicken cr <dig> and other mammalian l <dig> elements in their 5'utrs, which conceivably function as promoters.

very few cr <dig> 5'utr promoters are functional
evidence from rnai silencing of human l <dig> retrotransposons suggests that the first step for rnai machinery is synthesis of dsrnas from the transcriptionally active 5'utrs of retrotransposons  <cit> . the human l <dig> 5'utr is known to contain a bidirectional promoter  that leads to the production of dsrnas, which are processed by dicer into sirnas. to investigate the possibility that chicken 5'utrs might transcribe dsrnas, perhaps through dna hypomethylation, we analysed all putative 5'utrs of chicken cr <dig> elements identified through literature and database searches. a blastn search against a cr <dig> consensus sequence  suggests that the chicken genome probably contains around  <dig>  copies of the cr <dig> element scattered throughout the genome. to identify potentially active cr <dig> elements with intact promoters, the 5'utrs of the previously identified active f and b subfamilies  <cit>  were initially used for a blast search against the chicken genome. about  <dig> utrs  were identified and used in the promoter analysis. surprisingly, except for  <dig> utrs , the vast majority of cr <dig> 5'utrs  are found as short fragments  and are severely truncated or mutated to varying degrees. notably, most of the mutations or deletions occurred at putative transcription factor binding sites as determined by transfac searches  <cit>  against the promoter sequences of the cr <dig> elements. unlike the functionally active cr <dig> sequences, these elements do not contain cis-acting elements or putative promoter-like sequences upstream of the start codon, suggesting that the overwhelming majority of chicken cr <dig> elements do not have the necessary functional promoter sequences for initiation of rna transcription.

the 5'utr of the potentially active cr1-b element is approximately  <dig> bp long and contains two putative e boxes, the cis-element for binding of the basic helix-loop-helix family of proteins. e boxes have been noted as an obvious feature of vertebrate cr1-elements  <cit> . in addition to the e boxes, other potential binding sites for c/ebp, usf and sp <dig> are also found in the promoter sequence of cr1-b element . unlike other vertebrate cr1-elements such as those in the turtle and puffer fish  <cit> , there is no obvious evidence of a 32-bp direct repeat sequence within the cr1-b promoter sequence. several deletions or insertions, ranging from several nucleotides to several dozen nucleotides, were found in these regions of the cr1-b direct repeats suggesting that this region might have undergone frequent recombinational events. direct repeat sequences are often thought to be involved in dsrna production, which are processed by dicer into functional sirnas. interestingly, the 5'utr sequence of cr1-f element shows no resemblance to the 5'utr of cr1-b elements. unlike the cr1-b element, there is no sequence corresponding to canonical e boxes . promoter analysis of the cr1-f elements shows the presence of at least three regions corresponding to the binding of oct-1/ap- <dig>  core elements within the region of promoter. in addition, a potential binding site for gr  is also located at upstream of the start codon. gr is a zinc-finger dna-binding protein likely to be involved in the activation of cr1-f elements through a fos/jun complex similar to that found in the chicken vitellogenin and ovalbumin genes  <cit> . this observation raises the possibility that cellular transcription factors that bind to these genes might act in concert to regulate the expression of cr1-f elements.

sequence divergence of 5'utr within each cr <dig> subfamily
the intact and functionally active cr <dig> elements identified thus far belong to the cr1-b and cr1-f subfamilies. our study shows that the 5'utr promoter sequence of b and f elements are distinct and unrelated to each other, suggesting the existence of sequence diversity in the 5'utr promoters in the chicken genome. the relationships among the 5'utrs of all other cr <dig> subfamilies  are poorly understood. to evaluate the biological significance of all these cr <dig> promoters, we downloaded the 5'utr sequences of all cr <dig> subfamilies in the chicken genome and aligned them using clustalx . sequences that contained large truncations or deletions in the alignment of the 5'utr sequences were removed, resulting in a final set of  <dig> sequences that were used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree . the 5'utrs of chicken cr <dig> elements cluster into six distinct subfamilies. the largest group of 5'utrs belongs to subfamilies d and g  scattered throughout the chicken genome. except for a very few copies of b and f subfamily members, none of the cr <dig> elements representing the c, d, g, and h subfamilies contain sequences that might provide functionally active cr <dig> elements . this indicates that they are not retrotransposition competent. the most notable finding that emerged from our sequence analysis is that the 5'utr sequence of the functionally active cr1-f element has diverged from that of the non-functional cr1-f elements  indicating the existence of distinct promoter sequences for functional elements within the cr <dig> subfamily of the chicken genome.

functional cr <dig> elements are rare in the chicken genome
next, we analysed whether the intact 5'utr promoter contains the genomic dna sequence of full-length orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences. for this analysis, the consensus protein sequence of orf <dig> was initially used in a protein blat search against the chicken genome. the regions that showed similarity were isolated along with  <dig> kb of their flanking sequences. in a second step, the resulting genomic dna sequences were screened for the presence of an intact 5'utr promoter. we identified only six full-length cr <dig> elements with intact promoters  that have a size of > <dig>  bp; the others were severely truncated at either the 5' or 3'region of orfs. out of four cr1-f elements, three were found to contain intact promoters capable of rna transcription, but these elements are defective in the coding region of orf <dig> and orf <dig> due to frame-shift mutations . only one copy of the cr1-f element found on chromosome  <dig> with an intact promoter  appears to be functionally active with the ability to produce both orf proteins. its sequences are also in agreement with previous report of a functional 'mother' cr <dig> element  <cit> . similarly, out of two intact cr1-b elements, only one copy a of cr1-b element with intact promoter and orfs for both proteins was found on chromosome  <dig> . this element is 98% identical with the consensus sequence of cr1-b , whereas the other cr1-b element on chromosome  <dig>  was truncated at orf <dig>  interestingly, two additional cr1-b elements on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contained intact orf regions  but these elements do not contain promoter sequences that can serve as an initiation point for transcription. in summary, the overwhelming majority of chicken cr <dig> elements appear to be non-functional and thus unable to replicate. nonetheless, our findings suggest that there is at least one copy of the cr1-f and b subfamily still potentially capable of active in the chicken genome.

discussion
silencing the activity of retrotransposable elements is important for maintaining genomic integrity and stability  <cit> . it is commonly thought that sirnas derived from repetitive elements can protect the genome against transposable elements. supporting this notion, the first evidence in mammals  <cit>  shows that sirna derived from both strands of active l <dig> sequences control expression of l <dig> retrotransposons by dicer-mediated rnai silencing pathways. it has also been shown that knocking down dicer expression in human cells can lead to a marked increase in retrotransposition activity as well as accumulation of l <dig> transcripts, providing a direct link between the rnai machinery and suppression of transposable elements. a single copy of the dicer gene is also present in chicken and other vertebrates  <cit> , although the biological functions of dicer-mediated silencing pathways in the chicken are not yet fully understood. notably, until now there has been no direct evidence of an involvement of the chicken dicer enzyme in controlling the activity of endogenous chicken cr <dig> transposons.

in our current analysis, we evaluated the contribution of the dicer-mediated rnai machinery to control of chicken cr <dig> elements. in contrast to mammals, dicer knockdown in chicken cells did not result in increased expression of endogenous cr <dig> elements. however, when we introduced transcriptionally active human l <dig> elements into chicken cells in which dicer expression was depleted, a significant increase in the accumulation of l <dig> transcripts, as well as retrotransposition, was observed. the ability of chicken dicer to perform rnai silencing of mammalian transposons but not chicken cr <dig> elements highlights a major difference between the chicken cr <dig> and mammalian transposable elements. the response of chicken rnai machinery against exogenous l1s seems to be more subtle than that of some other eukaryotes such as mouse, c. elegans and drosophila, whose genomes can rapidly accumulate retrotransposon transcripts and acquire a mutator phenotype through disruption of rnai pathway  <cit> . this 'lying in wait' response of the chicken against human l <dig> elements is reminiscent of the rnai response against the line-like tad transposon in neurospora  <cit> . interestingly, like the chicken cr <dig> elements, most of the tad transposons are inactive in neurospora due to mutation and truncation. however, upon introduction of transcriptionally active tad elements, sirnas against tad elements are produced, prompting the activation of an rnai-mediated silencing pathway. thus, perhaps one role of the rnai machinery is to permit a rapid and potent response to the sudden activation of l <dig> retrotransposons.

there are several possible explanations for our failure to detect expression of endogenous cr <dig> transposons in dicer-deficient chicken cells. in one plausible model, we considered the possibility that additional chicken dicer enzymes might be redundantly employed in cr <dig> transposon control pathways, similar to that seen in neurospora in which two dicer enzymes are mutually able to control tad transposons  <cit> . recent evidence from drosophila and arabidopsis has also demonstrated that different dicer homologues can provide distinct substrate specificity  <cit> . however, this does not seem to be the case in chicken cells, which are known to contain a single copy of dicer on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, dicer deficiency in chicken dt <dig> cells has already been shown to cause defects in heterochromatin formation and aberrant accumulation of transcripts from α-satellite sequences through disruption of rnai-mediated silencing pathways  <cit> . moreover, our current data suggest that dicer-deficient chicken cells retain their ability to control mammalian l <dig> retrotransposon expression.

alternatively, as we see in mammals, activation of the rnai machinery may depend on initial transcription of retrotransposons to produce dsrnas, which serve as substrates for dicer processing into sirnas  <cit> . surprisingly, most of the chicken 5'utrs  are found to be severely truncated and mutated in the promoter regions of cr <dig> elements; nonetheless, there remain a very few copies of cr1-f and cr1-b elements still potentially capable of retrotransposition. our data show that except for one copy of the cr1-f and cr1-b elements, almost none of the chicken cr1s contain putative promoter-like sequences upstream of the transcriptional start codon, indicating that almost all chicken cr <dig> elements are not functionally active. only one functional cr1-f element with an intact promoter sequence and orfs for both proteins is found, on chromosome  <dig>  and is flanked by 5-bp target site duplication. similarly, only one copy of the cr1-b element identical with the consensus sequence of cr1-b  is found on chromosome  <dig>  this suggests that functionally active cr <dig> elements are very rare in the chicken genome. of course, it is possible that most of the cr <dig> elements have lost their activity during the course of evolution and become non-functional. the drastic reduction of intact cr <dig> copies and the lack of many active cr <dig> elements in the chicken genome suggest that chicken cr <dig> elements may possibly be approaching extinction.

a recent study in mammalian oocytes suggests that around  <dig>  molecules of dsrna are required to trigger dicer-mediated rnai silencing pathways  <cit> . production of such high levels of dsrna is likely to correlate with the level of rna expression. absence of large numbers of functionally active cr <dig> promoters is probably one of the reasons that even if a few copies of cr1-f and cr1-b do function, they are not sufficient to trigger dicer-mediated silencing. consistent with this, the present study shows that the chicken cr1-b promoter is much weaker than that of the human l <dig> promoter, by factor of sixfold. interestingly, the evolution of cr <dig> in the chicken genome seems to differ from that of l <dig> in mammals; unlike the single l <dig> lineage in mammals, our analysis shows that the chicken cr <dig> elements form six distinct subfamilies  that are considerably diverged from each other in their 5'utr regions. these results are also in agreement with a previous report of the 5'utr sequences of chicken cr1-b and cr1-f elements  <cit> . given the low degree of sequence homology in the 5'utrs of cr <dig> elements, if any sirnas are produced from a single cr <dig> locus, they would not have the potential to target every cr <dig> transcript for rnai-mediated control. indeed, our data suggest that control of the activity of chicken cr <dig> transposons is not mediated by dicer-related pathways , but by other silencing pathways.

it seems likely that the chicken has multiple mechanisms to ensure suppression of cr <dig> silencing, similar to what is seen in mouse oocytes in which retrotransposon silencing is carried out by both sirna and pi-interacting rna  pathways  <cit> . one plausible mechanism is dicer-independent pirnas. unlike sirnas, pirnas do not depend upon dicer  <cit>  and do not seem to be derived from dsrna precursors of active retrotransposons  <cit> . instead, they seem to arise from single-stranded rnas that are transcribed from pirna clusters. the nuclease activity of the piwi proteins  is required for pirna processing. recent studies in mice and drosophila showed that mutations in piwi proteins resulted in a loss of retrotransposon control  <cit> , suggesting a function for pirnas in retrotransposon control. pirnas are highly abundant in germ cells but some evidence suggests that they are also active in somatic tissues  <cit>  and are involved in retrotransposon silencing through chromatin modifications  <cit> . given that pirna production is not dependent on either dicer activity or transcriptional activation of retrotransposons to produce dsrna precursors, it is plausible that silencing of cr <dig> elements in the chicken might primarily occur through dicer-independent pirna pathways. an equally important possibility is cellular factors that can suppress the expression of cr <dig> elements in the chicken genome. further studies are required to provide the mechanistic support for cr <dig> silencing machinery.

CONCLUSIONS
the recent release of a chicken genome sequence revealed that less than 9% of the chicken genome contains retrotransposable elements. it is not known whether the low density of repetitive dna elements in the chicken genome is due to a lack of active elements or if chickens employ small rnai-mediated silencing pathways that control the activity and copy numbers of transposable elements. we analysed the loss of dicer function on chicken endogenous cr <dig> elements with impaired rnai machinery and found that the control of chicken cr <dig> elements is independent of the dicer-mediated rnai silencing pathway. in addition, our results strongly suggest that except for single copies of the cr1-f and cr1-b elements, almost none of the chicken cr <dig> elements contain the necessary promoter sequences for initiation of rna transcription. phylogenetic analysis shows the existence of sequence diversity at the 5'utr promoters within each cr <dig> subfamily, indicating that they are not potential targets for controlling the activity of every cr <dig> transcript by sirna pathway. our results provide the first evidence that the low level of repetitive elements in the chicken genome is probably due to the absence of a large number of active cr <dig> elements.
