BACKGROUND
surgical site infection  is a common complication after surgical intervention and incidence for ssi can be as high as  <dig> %, depending on the anatomical location of the surgical site . the onset of ssi has been associated with a variety of factors, including surgical sutures  <cit> . the property of surgical suture for adhering bacteria promotes the occurrence of such infections  <cit> . the use of antimicrobially coated sutures poses one possible approach to prevent or reduce suture-associated infections. at present, the only commercially available antimicrobial sutures are coated with triclosan, such as the resorbable multifil vicryl® plus  <cit> . several in vitro studies reported that triclosan-incorporated sutures showed high antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens . dependent on the surgery site, the clinical benefit of such coated sutures varies. on the one hand, no benefit was reported in studies for appendicitis, breast cancer or colorectal surgery . in contrast, the use of antimicrobial coated sutures in sternum surgery  <cit> , abdominal wall closure  <cit>  and cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures  <cit>  was associated with significantly lower wound infection rates. moreover, a recent meta-analysis showed a significant benefit of triclosan coated sutures to prevent surgical site infection  <cit> . however, due to its wide use in health-care, household and cosmetic items triclosan resistance is frequently reported for s. aureus a common pathogen in wound infections  <cit> . furthermore the promotion of multi drug resistances in the presence of triclosan via increased activity of efflux pump system is a major concern  <cit> . screening tests performed between  <dig> and  <dig> already demonstrated detection of triclosan in the urine of  <dig>  % of us citizens  <cit> . therefore, the development of sutures with different antimicrobial drugs is urgently required.

in a previous study, we established a coating process to render surgical sutures antiseptic, while meeting the european pharmacopoeia requirements for the material strength of surgical sutures  <cit> . we showed that sutures coated with the antimicrobial drug chlorhexidine pose a highly efficient alternative with low cytotoxicity to the established antimicrobial sutures using triclosan, such as vicryl® plus. furthermore we demonstrated a strongly dose dependent efficacy and biocompatibility. however, the antimicrobial effect lasted up to  <dig> days and biocompatibility was also limited. therefore, we chose the antimicrobial drug octenidine for further development of suture coatings. octenidine is well established in skin and wound antiseptic solutions, and even recommended as potential alternative in case of triclosan resistance  <cit> . further, this antiseptic drug has a broad-spectrum activity, including common pathogens of wound infections such as multiresistant bacteria  <cit> . in addition, the lower solubility in aqueous medium may result in slower drug release, with longer efficacy against pathogens and lower cytotoxicity compared to chlorhexidine coatings.

the aim of the present study was the development of antimicrobial octenidine containing formulations based on fatty acids. we focused on optimizing drug concentrations in order to achieve improved long-term antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility concerning resorbable sutures. both antimicrobial efficacy over several days, as well as cytotoxicity of novel coated octenidine containing sutures were compared to commercially available plain polyglycolic acid  and triclosan containing sutures like vicryl® plus.

methods
surgical sutures
sutures in our study had diameters according to united states pharmacopeia . the used suture consists of polyglycolic acid , free of fatty acids to avoid sewing effect. our investigations were compared with reference sutures .

antimicrobial coating solutions
antimicrobial coating solutions were prepared as follows: either palmitic or lauric acid together with octenidine were dissolved in  <dig>  % ethanol . the solutions contained  <dig>  mg of both components fatty acid and octenidine in  <dig>  g  ethanol, which corresponds to a mass content of  <dig> % . under aseptic conditions, the solutions had to be homogenized and filtered . two types of coating were produced: octenidine dihydrochloride  in lauric acid  and octenidine dihydrochloride in palmitic acid . both for ol and op, three different antiseptic drug concentrations inside coating solutions were chosen:  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % , respectively .table  <dig> octenidine fatty acid coating of sutures with  <dig> cm in length and the resulting concentrations


a) drug and fatty acid components were applied at given ratios above and dissolved in  <dig>  ml ethanol to produce the specific coating solutions with  <dig> % mass . b) octenidine content of coated sutures after preparation. the mean coating weight of  <dig> cm suture samples were determined at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg . weights on coated sutures for octenidine, fatty acid carrier and normalized mean drug weight per cm thread are given above



preparation of antimicrobial sutures
the sutures  were coated in a dipping process with the prepared antimicrobial coating solutions using a thermo-shaker  for  <dig> min at  <dig> °c at  <dig> rpm. subsequently, sutures were fixed on a device and dried for  <dig> h  at room temperature. after this drying process, the coating weight was determined by using a precision balance . the drug amount normalized per length of sutures  was calculated for each drug concentration  via the measured coating weight . finally, coated sutures of  <dig> cm length were vacuum-sealed in sterile polyethylene bags and stored at room temperature. at the beginning of the experiments, coated sutures were cut into  <dig> cm,  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm long samples.

antimicrobial efficacy of coated sutures via agar diffusion test
antimicrobial efficacy of sutures was tested via the agar diffusion test  compared to vicryl® plus. according to clsi criteria, suspensions of staphylococcus aureus  were prepared to an optical density of  <dig>  mcfarland standard. then,  <dig> ml of this suspension was plated uniformly on mueller hinton ii agar plates with  <dig> mm standard size. after removal of the supernatant and drying the petri dishes, suture samples were placed on the inoculated agar plates and incubated at  <dig> °c overnight. after  <dig> h, zones of inhibitions were measured in millimeter  by using a calliper perpendicular to the sutures. according to ming et al.  <cit> , this procedure was repeated daily by using the same suture samples for several days to recognize the remaining anti-bacterial activity until no detectable inhibition zone remained.

octenidine release from laurate and palmitate coatings
the octenidine release kinetics of the coated sutures were analysed over a period of  <dig> h in phosphate-buffered saline  at ph =  <dig> . sutures of  <dig> cm length  were put in  <dig> ml-cups  with  <dig> ml pbs at  <dig> °c in a thermomixer mhr  <dig>  at  <dig> rpm. elution media was replaced by fresh pbs at fixed time intervals . the release of octenidine was measured by absorption at a wavelength of  <dig> nm in a microplate photometer . the amount of measured octenidine was normalized to the length of suture samples. drug elution profiles were recorded by cumulating the released drug amounts over time. ratios of the released octenidine were calculated relating to the drug content on suture samples at  <dig> h, depending on octenidine concentration of coated sutures.

biocompatibility study
in accordance with both the iso 10993– <dig> guideline and the wst- <dig> assay instruction, analysis of in vitro cytotoxicity of coated sutures was performed by using mouse fibroblasts l- <dig>  and measuring the metabolic activity of cells in the presence of eluates from coated sutures. cell cultures grew in the corresponding dulbecco's modified eagle medium  consisting of  <dig> % fetal bovine serum at  <dig> °c and  <dig>  % co <dig> in a humidified atmosphere. each well of a  <dig> well microtiter plate was filled with  <dig>  cells and  <dig> μl dmem, followed by incubation over  <dig> h. eluates were generated simultaneously by placing coated sutures  of  <dig> cm in length in  <dig> ml tubes containing  <dig>  ml dmem, for  <dig> h on a thermomixer at  <dig> °c and  <dig> rpm. subsequently, cell culture’s media were replaced by the eluates after  <dig> h. after  <dig> h, each well was supplemented with  <dig> μl wst- <dig> reagent to commence cell reaction to generate formazan salts by cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenases. after a reaction time of  <dig> h at  <dig> °c, the amount of formazan salts was detected at  <dig> nm in an absorption reader. metabolic activities were referred to l- <dig> cells used as growth reference without sutures. a threshold of  <dig> % according to iso 10993– <dig> standard was used to claim “biocompatibility” for drug eluting sutures.

statistics
statistical analysis was conducted by using the student’s t-test with significant level p <  <dig> . measurements based on mean values and standard deviations from at least three values. the gaussian error propagation law was used to correct mean value calculations from several measurements.

RESULTS
reproducibility of antimicrobial suture coatings
independently from the drug concentrations used, the mean coating weight - the difference between the uncoated and coated sutures of  <dig> cm in length was  <dig>  mg ±  <dig>  mg . the amount of octenidine, fatty acid and the normalized amount of drug per length of thread was calculated for each drug concentration relative to this mean coating weight;  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/cm, respectively . the weight of the triclosan containing vicryl® plus sutures was  <dig>  μg/cm  <cit> , as declared by the manufacturer.

antimicrobial efficacy of coated sutures via agar diffusion test
lauric and palmitic coating of octenidine kept zones of inhibition relatively stable from the second to the ninth day of experiments from  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm at day  <dig> . on the tenth day, experiments were discontinued because the threads lost stability by humidity on agar plates and could not be transferred anymore. long-term protection was detected for the three drug concentrations, without depletion of the antimicrobial efficacy. triclosan coated sutures  demonstrated zones from  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm of microbial inhibition for the same observation period .fig.  <dig> antimicrobial long-term efficacies via agar diffusion tests using s. aureus lawns  showed inhibition zones over time for a octenidine-laurate coated sutures, b octenidine-palmitate coated sutures. each coating type with three different octenidine concentrations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/cm. c vicryl® plus as reference for commercial antimicrobial sutures



octenidine release from laurate and palmitate coatings
the release of octenidine from fatty acid coatings was measured over a period of  <dig> h via elution in pbs. as demonstrated, octenidine release  depends on the used fatty acid as a coating component. octenidine values cumulated over  <dig> h for octenidine-laurate coated sutures showed released concentrations of  <dig>  μg/ml/cm ,  <dig>  μg/ml/cm , and  <dig>  μg/ml/cm . elution data with palmitate as retarding agent showed excellent delayed action. after  <dig> h, palmitate coated sutures reached  <dig>  μg/ml/cm ,  <dig>  μg/ml/cm  and  <dig>  μg/ml . the released amounts at  <dig> h were referred to the absolute amount of octenidine on coated sutures in percent . the degree of octenidine release calculated for octenidine-laurate coatings results in 82 ±  <dig> % , 88 ±  <dig> % , and 87 ±  <dig> % . in comparison, octenidine-palmitate coatings released only 7 ±  <dig> % , 5 ±  <dig> % , and 33 ±  <dig> %  of the coated octenidine.fig.  <dig> elution profiles in pbs buffer at  <dig> °c from a octenidine-laurate coatings and b octenidine-palmitate coated pga sutures. elution profiles were determined for each coating type at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/cm containing sutures. horizontal lines depict the normalized drug contents per cm coated suture, representing the limit of drug release for each drug concentration

discussion
surgical site infections caused by sutures represent a serious problem in clinics. antimicrobially coated sutures may reduce suture-associated surgical site infections. bacterial contamination of the wound associated with sutures occurs through the exogenous pathway. pathogens are introduced either during surgery or from natural skin flora via wicking effect. in the presence of suture materials a smaller amount of pathogens is often sufficient to cause an infection compared to wounds without foreign material  <cit> . in this study, we coated surgical sutures with  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> μg octenidine per cm length either in a palmitate or laurate fatty acid as retarding carrier. the coated sutures were tested regarding their antimicrobial efficacy, octenidine release and biocompatibility. we found that the antimicrobial activity of octenidine coated sutures was as long as for triclosan coated sutures, like vicryl® plus. the favorable antimicrobial suture coating at  <dig> μg/cm was associated with high biocompatibility.

according to antimicrobial efficacy, inhibition zones of octenidine coated sutures on bacterial lawns were detected for up to  <dig> days. in comparison to the triclosan control group , the zones of inhibitions of octenidine were smaller, although the amount of octenidine on the sutures was significantly more than used with triclosan. this discrepancy in inhibition zones can be related to the presumably slower drug release by diffusion of octenidine over time compared to triclosan. this study was aimed to evaluate concentrations of octenidine on sutures in the balance of antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility. released octenidine concentrations are thus low, but that may be desirable to protect the suture material, ensuring drug release for the first critical week of wound healing. both octenidine- and triclosan coated sutures revealed a long lasting antimicrobial effect, but degradation of absorbable suture samples by hydrolysis caused termination of experiments after the ninth day. despite this degradation process, no increase of inhibition zone could be detected as a possible indication of a sudden burst of octenidine release. nevertheless, the results of this in-vitro model must be validated in-vivo prior to the application in humans, in order to dismiss concerns for acute toxicity as a consequence of the suture degradation process of octenidine coated sutures. the time dependency of inhibition zones did not differ greatly regarding the loaded drug concentrations of octenidine, so the three drug concentrations are equally effective absorbable sutures, as the essential protection is at least ensured for  <dig> days. since the mechanism of wound healing provide an unaltered germ free de novo synthesis of tissue, this time period of antimicrobial protection should be sufficient to prevent infection during the first essential phase of wound healing.

the assessment of octenidine kinetics showed a slow continuous release over the first days of the experiment for each coated suture. the release of octenidine was delayed by the used fatty acid carriers and the drug’s low solubility in aqueous media. triclosan coated sutures in such media, like vicryl® plus assessed similar durations of drug release  <cit> . additionally, these data confirm our measured efficacy over at least  <dig> days for vicryl® plus sutures, considering the fact that our tested sutures from the eu containing less triclosan , than vicryl® plus sutures available in the us   <cit> . drug release kinetics over  <dig> days for octenidine coatings showed, that all type of coatings retarded the attached octenidine without full depletion. it is accepted that the antimicrobial coating remains between the suture filaments. thus, the so-called wick effect of multifilament thread can be interrupted.

referring to the drug carriers, palmitic acid in coatings showed a much slower drug release characteristic in comparison to lauric acid coatings demonstrating comparable antimicrobial efficacies. the ratio between released drug and loaded drug amounts on sutures after  <dig> days indicates that no coating type had fully washed-out the antimicrobial agent octenidine. similar to our previous findings  <cit> , we found that palmitic acid carriers delay the drug release more effectively than lauric acid carriers do. as anticipated, the octenidine release was dependent on the initial drug concentration in the suture coatings. antimicrobial action could be demonstrated even for the lowest octenidine concentration  over  <dig> days. especially, the palmitic acid coatings may guarantee a longer antimicrobial effect than lauric acid carriers may. therefore, we recommend a combination of the drug octenidine with palmitic acid as carrier for long-term antiinfective protection of surgical sutures to avoid surgical site infections.

biocompatibility, as defined by the iso 10993–5: <dig> guideline was reached for octenidine at the lowest concentration  with both coatings consisting of palmitic acid and lauric acid. cytotoxicity tests of coated octenidine sutures showed a strong dose dependency. an increased drug concentration on loaded sutures, revealed an increased cytotoxic reaction. octenidine-palmitate and -laurate sutures at  <dig> μg/cm showed similar metabolic activities in comparison to pure lauric and palmitic acid coated sutures. compared to commercially available triclosan sutures , octenidine-palmitate coated sutures also met the iso standard for biocompatibility.

the comparison of octenidine coated sutures to chlorhexidine coatings, tested in a previous study  <cit> , showed different results in antimicrobial efficacy, drug release and biocompatibility by using the same antiseptic drug quantities. octenidine sutures in lauric or palmitic acid showed initial slightly smaller inhibition zones than of chlorhexidine coatings during the first days of experiment. however, the duration of the inhibition zones lasted substantially longer for octenidine coatings, at least up to  <dig> days. octenidine-laurate coated sutures compared to chlorhexidine-laurate coatings showed similar released drug amounts at  <dig> h, but the time span until flat drug kinetics were reached were much longer. in addition, the drug release of octenidine-palmitate sutures lasted longer and showed smaller released amounts at  <dig> h, referring to slower release compared to chlorhexidine-palmitate coatings. the reason for the longer drug release of octenidine can be related to the lower solubility of palmitic acid carrier and octenidine itself in aqueous media, such as pbs. additionally, we observed that octenidine coatings were less cytotoxic by using the same drug doses compared to chlorhexidine coatings. therefore, the drug release kinetics, antimicrobial activities and biocompatibility of octenidine coated sutures are superior compared to chlorhexidine coatings.

our study has two main limitations: first, antimicrobial coated sutures were exposed to only one pathogenic strain, s. aureus. herewith we wanted to primarily demonstrate the feasibility of effective triclosan alternatives. the activity of octenidine against other relevant bacteria as well as biofilm inactivation against s. aureus has been published  <cit> . therefore, antimicrobial efficacy of coated sutures against other common pathogens of wound infections should be tested in the future. second, the influence of the biofilm formation on the antimicrobial efficacy of the coated sutures was not simulated in our experiments. regardless, the use of octenidine is likely to circumvent any of the acquired resistances which are limiting the extended use of triclosan.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, novel octenidine coatings to render surgical sutures antimicrobial with three different concentrations based on palmitic/lauric acid were developed and analyzed. all novel coatings proved high long-term antimicrobial efficacy against s. aureus. octenidine coatings with drug concentration of  <dig> μg/cm on sutures combine long-term antimicrobial efficacy up to  <dig> days and slow drug release with demonstrated high biocompatibility. the drug release was dependent on the fatty acid carrier and optimized delay was represented for palmitate. compared to the commercially available vicryl® plus the antimicrobial efficacy of octenidine coated sutures was only slightly reduced. the potential disadvantages of triclosan are severe toxic side products such as dioxide and the promotion of multi drug resistance, which justifies the search for alternative substances for future use. however, despite these promising results, it needs to be clearly pointed out that it cannot be concluded from our findings that octenidine coated sutures are superior to the triclosan coated sutures. therefore, further studies are necessary to prove that octenidine coated sutures represent a serious alternative to the currently commercially available triclosan coated sutures.
