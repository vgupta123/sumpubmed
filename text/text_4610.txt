BACKGROUND
genome wide analyses have in recent years revealed an increasing number of noncoding rnas   <cit> , however, the functional roles of these ncrnas are mostly still unknown. characterizing the transcriptional activity of the promoters of these loci could be a useful step towards revealing their functional roles. extensive analysis of ncrna promoters have been carried out in human, drosophila and yeast  <cit> . there are more than  <dig> known short ncrnas loci reported in c. elegans  and a recent tiling microarray study suggests the existence of an additional  <dig> short transcripts with unknown function   <cit> . however, compared to the extensive work on promoter of protein coding genes, few analyses of ncrna promoter activity have been performed in this species  <cit> .

analysis of the  <dig> bp upstream sequences of  <dig> c. elegans ncrnas using the meme software  <cit>  detected three distinct  <dig> bp upstream motifs   <cit> . among the  <dig> ncrnas, um <dig> is found at the loci of  <dig> ncrnas, including  <dig> snrnas,  <dig> snornas and  <dig> snlrnas. um <dig> is found at the loci of  <dig> ncrnas, of which  <dig> are snornas. um <dig> is found at the loci of  <dig> ncrnas, all are stem-bulge rnas . of the  <dig> transcripts of unknown function  <cit> , um1- <dig> are found at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci, respectively.

the core sequence of the  <dig> bp long um <dig> is the  <dig> bp long snrna proximal sequence element   <cit> . this core sequence is composed of two sub-motifs spaced by  <dig> bp . in the drosophila pse the corresponding sub-motifs have been denoted as psea and pseb  <cit>  and we have used the same denotation here. most of the c. elegans pse/um <dig> loci are tata-less, and transcripts generated from such loci generally carry a 5'-end cap, suggesting transcription by polymerase ii  <cit> .

in the second motif  the most invariant sub-motifs are spaced by  <dig> bp and strongly resemble the box a and b motifs of the trna internal promoter , which is known to bind transcription factor iiic   <cit> . it is possible that um <dig> is derived from trna genes that have served as promoters for downstream ncrna genes, as similar trna-snorna dicistronic transcriptional structures have been described in plants and yeast  <cit> . most of the um <dig> loci encode snornas which generally produce uncapped transcripts terminated at an oligo-t tract, and are thus likely to be transcribed by polymerase iii  <cit> , though the lack of a cap could also be due to processing of the primary snorna transcript  <cit> .

the third motif  resembles the pse/um <dig> in that they both contain the pseb sub-motif, but um <dig> lacks psea, and has in addition a structure with the consensus motif gtata located closer to the ncrna transcription start site . um <dig> is exclusively found at stem-bulge rna  loci. the sbrnas are terminated at an oligo-t tract, and most appear to be uncapped, indicating transcription by rna polymerase iii  <cit> .

short ncrna loci in c. elegans are frequently found in introns of protein coding genes  <cit> . such loci may or may not have an upstream motif. previous analyses have found that for ncrnas located in introns, the expression levels of intronic ncrna loci not containing any obvious upstream motifs are closely correlated to the expression levels of the host genes  <cit> . on the other hand, for intronic ncrna locus containing an upstream motif, the expression of the ncrna locus is uncorrelated to the host gene expression, indicating that ncrna loci with upstream motifs are independently transcribed  <cit> .

no specific analysis of the ncrna promoters appears to have been carried out in c. elegans, however, previous analysis has shown that a fragment including the first  <dig> bp upstream of the sl <dig> rna  is sufficient to drive lacz expression  <cit> , and mutation of four bases in the pseb submotif resulted in a 10-fold reduction in transcription of an sl <dig> rna  <cit> . we here demonstrate the transcriptional activity of the three c. elegans ncrna promoters. the roles of the most invariant sub-motifs were investigated by mutation analysis, and the extent of upstream sequence with influence on the ncrna transcriptional activity was analysed.

RESULTS
in order to analyse the transcriptional activities of the three common ncrna motifs, we made constructs containing varying amounts  of upstream sequences  fused to the green fluorescent protein  open reading frame . constructs containing approximately  <dig> bp upstream sequences  were used to test the inherent transcriptional activity of each upstream motif, whereas constructs with longer upstream sequences  were employed to investigate the possibility of additional regulatory elements.

all the three upstream motifs are transcriptionally active
cloning of approximately  <dig> bp upstream sequence encompassing each of the three upstream motifs 1– <dig> in front of chimeric ncrna::gfp reporter genes suggested that all three motifs have independent transcriptional activity. to test whether the pse/um <dig> is sufficient for ncrna expression, we made a reporter construct consisting of a fragment of the cen <dig> locus including  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp transcribed  sequence. the cen <dig> locus encodes an sl <dig> rna with a tata-less pse/um <dig> upstream sequence. the fragment was inserted into plasmid ppd95_ <dig>  which contains a gfp orf, thereby creating a cen7::gfp chimeric reporter gene . the recombined gene was co-injected with the rol- <dig> marker gene into young adult hermaphrodite gonads, and transgenic strains were selected based on the presence of the roller phenotype. reporter gene expression was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  with one primer located in the cen <dig> fragment and the other primer in the plasmid sequence, using rna extracted from transgenic c. elegans strains . to confirm that the observed transcriptional activation was not a spurious result, we further selected an additional pse/um <dig> sl <dig> rna locus . the construct cen16-1_ <dig> was made as above from a fragment containing  <dig> bp upstream sequence and  <dig> bp transcribed sequence, and expression of the fusion reporter  was confirmed with rt-pcr . transgenic strains containing the empty plasmid ppd95_ <dig> were also obtained the same way as described above, but no reporter gene expression was observed by rt-pcr.

the upstream motif  <dig> is composed of two sub-motifs with sequence and spacing similar to that of the a and b boxes of the trna promoter. to address the transcriptional activity of um <dig>  two constructs were made. one  was made from a fragment containing  <dig> bp upstream sequence and  <dig> bp transcribed sequence from the snorna locus cen <dig>  the other  from a fragment containing  <dig> bp upstream sequence and  <dig> bp transcribed sequence from the snorna locus cen <dig>  rt-pcr with one primer located in the cen <dig> and cen <dig> fragment and the other primer in the plasmid sequence demonstrated the expression of transgenes cen37::gfp and cen55::gfp, respectively .

upstream motif  <dig> is exclusively found at stem-bulge rna  loci. to determine the transcriptional activity of um <dig>   <dig> bp and  <dig> bp of the upstream sequence of the sbrna loci cen74- <dig> and cen <dig>  respectively, was cloned in front of the gfp orf in ppd95_ <dig> to yield constructs cen74-2_ <dig> and cen72_ <dig> . rt-pcr verified the expression of both reporter fusions .

additional regulatory elements
to assay whether the sequence upstream of each motif might contain additional regulatory elements, we also constructed plasmids containing approximately  <dig> to  <dig> bp fragments of the 5'-flanking sequence from the cen <dig>  cen <dig> and cen74- <dig> loci, respectively. transgenes expression levels were assayed by quantitative rt-pcr , and for each construct,  <dig> to  <dig> transgenic lines were tested.

in the case of um <dig>  qrt-pcr of rna from transgenic strains showed that the expression driven by cen7_ <dig>  was 4– <dig> fold higher than expression driven by cen7_ <dig> , strongly suggesting the existence of an enhancer located within the 90~ <dig> bp upstream region. however, a search for 5' end features in this region of pse/um <dig> ncrnas in c. elegans failed to yield any common motifs . the expression driven by cen7_1k showed an almost identical level to that of cen7_ <dig>  indicating that no additional regulatory elements exist within the 264~ <dig> bp upstream of the ncrna locus. in the case of um <dig>  no significant increase in expression was found by increasing the length of the upstream fragment to  <dig> bp . similarly, qrt-pcr indicated no increase in expression of the um <dig> locus when the upstream region was extended to  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp . these observations suggest that for the two assumed rna polymerase iii-driving promoters  most or all the promoter activity resides within  <dig> bp of the 5'end of the respective annotated loci.

mutational analysis of promoter sub-motifs
each of the three upstream motifs contains two sub-motifs whose base pairs are particularly invariant among loci. to investigate the contribution of the psea and pseb sub-motifs to the overall pse/um <dig> transcriptional activity, we mutated each of the two sub-motifs mainly by converting each purine and pyrimidine residue to its opposite purine and pyrimidine, respectively , in the context of cen7_1k. the corresponding constructs were labeled as cen7_amut, cen7_bmut and cen7_mut. mutation of either of the two sub-motifs  reduced expression to 3~ <dig> % of that of cen7_1k, suggesting that both psea and pseb are required for the transcription of pse/um <dig> loci .

the sub-motifs in um <dig> promoter strongly resemble the a and b box motifs of the trna internal promoter. mutation of either of these two motifs in the context of cen37_1k caused a strongl reduction in the expression levels of the mutant constructs . concomitant mutation of both sub-motifs mut) reduced the expression level to  <dig> % compared with cen37_1k.

of the two sub-motifs in um <dig>  one strongly resembles the pseb of the pse/um <dig>  whereas the second sub-motif has the consensus sequence gtata. we mutated both motifs in the same fashion as described above, and observed the effect on expression in the context of cen74-2_ <dig>  abolishing the pseb-like sub-motif  reduced the expression level to  <dig> % compared with that of non-mutated cen74-2_ <dig>  mutation of the gtata sub-motif produced an even more modest reduction  than pseb. mutating both sub-motifs simultaneously, however, resulted in near abolishment of expression of the reporter mut; figure 3c). the results suggest a certain redundancy in regulatory activity between the two sub-motifs of um <dig>  but also that at least one of the sub-motifs must be present for expression of the downstream locus to occur at an appreciable rate.

transcription start sites of the upstream motif loci
5' race performed on non-mutated constructs found that the tss of cen7::gfp and cen74-2::gfp were identical to 5' ends of the endogenous rnas. for cen37::gfp, however, the tss was apparently located  <dig> bp upstream of the 5' end of mature endogenous rna and  <dig> bp upstream of um <dig> sequence itself .

um <dig> – a possible remnant of trna-snorna dicistronic loci
as shown above, 5' race of the reporter transcript of a um <dig> construct  found that transcription was initiated  <dig> bp upstream of the 5'end of the mature endogenous rna, and even  <dig> bp upstream of the um <dig> sequence. in plants, dicistronic trna-snorna transcripts, which are subsequently cleaved to yield mature trna and snorna have been described  <cit> . to investigate whether the um <dig> is also internally located with regards to the primary transcript of the endogenous rnas, we visually inspected the tiling microarray data  <cit>  for possible evidence of transcription of the um <dig> site itself. although we found no indication of expression of the um <dig> sequence at the cen <dig> locus, we found other  <dig> instances with indications of some level of expression,  <dig> at known snorna loci and five preceding unannotated tufs. in addition to cen <dig>  we therefore selected five candidate loci  for analysis by 3' race as indicated in figure  <dig>  if the dicistronic trna-snorna model also applies to the um2-snorna transcripts, two race bands should be expected, one corresponding to the um2-snorna primary transcript, the other to the um <dig> fragment remaining after cleavage. four  of the  <dig> loci yielded race fragments of length expected if transcription initiation occurred at the start of, or upstream of the um <dig> sequence, and sequencing confirmed a joint um2-snorna transcript in all four cases. a band corresponding to a smaller fragment was observed in three cases, but none of the sequences included the um <dig> fragment. thus, the part of the primary transcript that contains the um <dig> sequence is either rapidly degraded after cleavage, or the um2-containing fraction of the primary transcript is removed by 5'exonuclease digestion during maturation of the snorna. 5' race analysis showed that the transcription of the um <dig> loci starts 9~ <dig> bp upstream of the first base in the box a-like sub-motif.

transcriptional termination
transcripts derived from um <dig> and um <dig> loci are usually terminated at a run of several consecutive thymidine  residues, which is a property of loci transcribed by rna polymerase iii. the minimal number of consecutive t residues sufficient for termination of rna polymerase iii transcription varies among organisms, but analysis of known um <dig> and um <dig> loci suggests  <dig> consecutive ts are sufficient for termination in c. elegans . this is similar to what has been found in human and mouse, but is less than the 5– <dig> normally needed for termination in the yeast species   <cit> . in the plasmid ppd95_ <dig> there are runs of four  ts located at variable distances from the plasmid multicloning site . to determine the actual termination sites of the um <dig> and um <dig> constructs, we performed 3'race on the resulting reporter transcripts. for cen37_1k  the reporter transcript terminated at the first, second and third "tttt" tracts . for the cen74-2_ <dig>  construct, reporter transcript termination was identical to what has been observed in cen37_1k . qrt-pcr of fragments corresponding to the different termination sites suggested that most of the um <dig> and um <dig> reporter transcripts terminated at the first "tttt" tract .

pse/um <dig> drive expression of gfp
3'race of the um <dig> reporter transcript gave no specific result, but rt-pcr indicated that at least a fraction of the gfp orf was included in the transcript. we further investigated the expression of gfp in worms from 2– <dig> independent transgenic strains from each of the different constructs. no gfp expression was observed after genetic transformation with any of the um <dig>  and um <dig>  constructs. however, marked gfp expression was observed under fluorescent microscope for the cen7_1k and cen7_ <dig> transgenic worms, and even the cen7_ <dig> transgenic worms showed weak gfp expression. to eliminate the possibility that the observed gfp expression was an effect of this particular pse/um <dig> locus, we tested another pse/um <dig> ncrna locus, cen16- <dig>  whose upstream sequence was also able to drive gfp expression. 5'-end race performed on rna extracted from cen7_1k, cen7_ <dig> and cen16-1_1k transgene worms showed that the transcription start site of the reporters were identical to that of the wild type ncrna loci, suggesting that the transcriptional activity resulting in the observed gfp expression was the same as that driving the transcription of the endogenous ncrnas.

since pse/um <dig> could drive expression of gfp, we used um1::gfp fusions to analyse the temporal-spatial expression pattern of related ncrna loci having this upstream motif. one group of such loci are the c. elegans sl <dig> rnas, which are a nematode-specific group of ncrnas that function in trans-splicing of operonic mrnas. there are around  <dig> sl <dig> rna loci in c. elegans with slightly variable sequence characteristics. as far as is known, all participate in the same function, i.e. joining of an additional "exon" to the 5'end of internal  mrnas in operonic loci, but nothing appears to be known about the background for the numerous and variable sl <dig> rna loci in the c. elegans genome. previous experiments have demonstrated that different sl <dig> rna genes show different temporal expression patterns  <cit> , but little is known about their spatial expression patterns. we therefore examined the temporal-spatial expression of five sl <dig> rna genes using promoter::gfp fusion constructs. the tested ncrnas showed considerable variation in expression both in time and space. cen <dig> is principally expressed in hypodermal cells, which is in agreement with previous in situ hybridization result  <cit> , but also showed expression in skin muscles, excretory cells, head and ventral neuron cells . the cen16- <dig> locus was also active in excretory cells, and showed strong expression in the pharynx . two other loci, cen <dig> and cen <dig>  showed marked expression in intestinal muscles near the tail , however, their temporal expression pattern differed, cen <dig> showing visible expression from larval stage  <dig>  while cen <dig> showed no expression until the mature adult stage. the fifth sl <dig> rna locus, cen <dig>  is expressed in intestinal muscles near the vulva . the temporal expression pattern is generally identical with previously northern and microarray analysis  <cit> . cen <dig>  cen16- <dig> and cen <dig> showed strong expression from an early stage of embryo development  through the mature adult stage, whereas cen <dig> and cen <dig> both showed stage specific expression.

an interesting question is whether the transcriptional activity of the various sl <dig> rna loci correlates with their target loci . to this end we downloaded spliced leader  <cit>  and expressional data  <cit> . however, mrna spliced to a specific sl <dig> rna do not show any well correlated spatial expression patterns , and even though it is possible to find sl <dig> rna loci whose expression resembles one or a few of sl <dig> rna  <cit>  and mrna temporal expression data  <cit>  did not show any significant correlation between specific sl <dig> rnas and their target mrnas .

we also observed that mutations in the psea and pseb sub-motifs greatly changed the expression patterns of the cen <dig> locus constructs mut) compared with that of non-mutated constructs . the cen7_1k and cen7_ <dig> constructs were clearly expressed in hypodermal cells, skin muscles, excretory cells, head and ventral neurons , however, the expression driven by cen <dig> mutations was restricted to amphid and tail neuron cells . this suggests that the sequence characteristics of psea and pseb are not only important for the general expression level of a locus, but may also influence where and when a locus is expressed.

discussion
non-protein-coding rnas are gaining in importance as functional elements in eukaryote cellular and organismal development  <cit> . c. elegans is one of the most important biological model systems for genetic and developmental studies, and it has recently been demonstrated that around  <dig> % of the transcriptional output in this organism cannot be identified as arising from protein-coding genes  <cit> . among this vast amount of transcripts there are approximately  <dig> relatively well-defined short non-coding transcripts. a notable fraction of these have strongly invariant upstream sequence motifs and this study has demonstrated that three of these motifs are able to activate in vivo transcription of otherwise inactive reporter genes.

the pse/um <dig> sequence is found at about  <dig> % of the  <dig> known or putative noncoding loci, and is the most common promoter structure of c. elegans noncoding rnas. most of the pse/um <dig> ncrnas are highly expressed, indicating this motif has relatively strong promoter activity. however, the expression levels of the pse/um <dig> loci vary greatly, even within the same functional class. for example, within the sl <dig> rnas the expression levels of different loci can differ more than  <dig> fold  <cit> . our analysis indicated that sequence elements within - <dig> to - <dig> bp relative to the transcription start site are also important for expression from the um1-type promoter. at human snrna loci a distal sequence element  is commonly found around  <dig> bp upstream of transcription start site  <cit> , but a search in the region upstream of the pse/um <dig> in c. elegans failed to identify any common sequence motif .

the pse/um <dig> promoter was also shown to drive expression of the protein  encoded in the reporter construct, suggesting that this motif activates rna polymerase ii expression. this agrees with previous evidence that the c. elegans pse can drive expression of a lac-z mrna  <cit> , but is the first demonstration in c. elegans of an active protein expressed under an ncrna promoter. the transcriptional activity of two other upstream motifs  was clearly demonstrated by rt-pcr, but no gfp expression was observed from these two promoters. the um <dig> motif clearly resembles the trna promoter which is known to activate rna polymerase iii transcription through binding to the transcription factor iiic  <cit> . although polymerase specificity was not interrogated in this study, accumulated evidence  <cit>  suggests that both um <dig> and um <dig> activate rna polymerase iii transcription. this is further corroborated by the finding that both endogenous loci and reporter constructs activated by these two promoters terminate transcription at runs of four  consecutive t residues.

the observation that the pse/um <dig> promoter is able to drive gfp expression could allow for detailed analysis of the spatial-temporal expression of pse/um <dig> loci. much genome wide data on the temporal expression of coding and noncoding genes in c. elegans have been obtained through serial analysis of gene expression  and microarrays  <cit> , and large scale expression profiling aimed at the spatial expression pattern of protein coding genes have been performed by several groups  <cit> . however, there are almost no data available on the spatial expression patterns of ncrnas. as demonstrated in this study, a gfp expression under pse/um <dig> promoters from sl <dig> rna agreed well with reported in situ hybridization data  <cit> , and was able to specify the detailed expression characteristics of several sl <dig> rna loci, in some cases down to the cellular level. determination of the spatial and temporal expression patterns of ncrnas can be the key to their function, and this assay could be a very convenient tool for in vivo analysis of the expression pattern of the tata-less um <dig> loci. an additional aspect is that there appear to be few reports on embryo-specific promoters in c. elegans, and the finding that some of the pse/um <dig> promoters are active at this stage may be of practical use to other research within the field.

as a promoter the um <dig> sequence represents a particularly interesting case. the sub-motifs of the um <dig> resemble the trna internal promoter elements box a and b, and 5'race analysis showed that the um <dig> sequence was embedded in the primary reporter transcript. detailed re-analysis of the c. elegans tiling microarray data  <cit>  indicated the existence of similar primary transcripts arising from several genomic um <dig> loci, and subsequent 3'race verified this. the fact that a um2-containing primary transcript could not be identified at all inspected loci  could owe to the primary transcripts being inherently unstable and rapidly degraded during snorna maturation  <cit> . the c. elegans um <dig> primary transcripts resemble the dicstronic trna-snorna transcripts found at a few plant and yeast loci  <cit> . recently, several drosophila snornas were found to derive from longer rna polymerase iii transcripts, some of which were shown to contain an element similar to the b box of the trna promoter  <cit> , and closer inspection of the same sequences in drosophila also suggested the presence of an a box-like element upstream of the b box-like sequence at several loci. in the yeast genome there has also been reported one snorna whose rna polymerase iii transcription is driven by an a+b box configuration  <cit> . in vitro experiments in yeast demonstrated that box a alone can direct efficient tfiiic-dependent transcription, while box b is dispensable  <cit> , however, in vivo experiments found that both box a and b are required for the downstream transcripts accumulation  <cit> . the in vivo mutational analysis reported here also suggests a requirement for both box a and b for efficient transcription of um <dig> loci in c. elegans. given that similar snorna promoter characteristics are found in animals, plants and fungi could point to a very old promoter strategy that utilised a trna-like promoter to drive expression of snorna genes.

although the promoter activities of ncrnas, in particular those of snrnas, have been analysed in great detail in a variety of organisms such as human, drosophila and yeast for a couple of decades, little work has been done in c. elegans. our work demonstrated that all the three investigated upstream motifs in c. elegans are transcriptionally active. however, this work has only concentrated on promoters with distinctive sequence characteristics, and the great majority of intergenic ncrna loci show no obvious upstream motifs. what sequence elements are important and which protein complexes are recruited to initiate the transcription of such loci is still not known, and further efforts are needed for better a understanding of the c. elegans ncrna transcriptional mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate here the transcriptional activities of three putative ncrna promoters. mutational analysis found that the most invariant sub-motifs of the um <dig> and um <dig> sequences are required for the downstream genes transcription, while the two sub-motifs of um <dig> show redundancy with respect to transcriptional activity. we also show that um <dig> can drive expression of gfp, suggesting that this promoter drive rna polymerase ii transcription, and the um1::gfp fusions have shown to be useful in determine the temporal-spatial expression patterns of um <dig> ncrnas. um <dig> and um <dig> can not drive the expression of gfp, and termination at "tttt" tract strongly suggests rna polymerase iii transcription. several cases of trna-snorna dicistronic transcription pattern have been found, and it is likely that most of the um <dig> snornas apply this model of transcription.
