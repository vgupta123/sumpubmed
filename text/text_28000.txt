BACKGROUND
many organisms such as cyanobacteria, fruit flies, mammals and plants have an endogenous time-keeping mechanism, a circadian clock, to gauge daily and seasonal environmental changes. circadian clock systems in plants regulate various photoperiodic and diurnal responses, such as photomorphogenic processes, floral transition, leaf movements, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic capacity, and volatile emissions . among these, means to discriminate the length of the photoperiod are conserved among plant species, and it is commonly thought that circadian clock system of plants shares a basic mechanism that controls photoperiodic responses.

in the past decade, numerous molecular genetic analyses of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana have uncovered the basic molecular network of the plant circadian clock . mathematical analyses have been used to develop a computational model of the plant clock system, which contains the main transcriptional feedback loop  and two additional loops  associated with the main loop   <cit> . this multiple feedback loop system of the plant clock system is composed of two gene families, pseudo-response regulators  and late elongated hypocotyl/circadian clock associated  <dig> , and two unknown factors . the main feedback loop  consists of two lhy/cca <dig> genes, the pseudo-response regulator 1/timing of cab <dig> expression  <dig>  gene and the unknown factor "x". in this loop, the feedback regulatory network operates as follows: the evening-acting prr1/toc <dig> gene induces the morning-acting lhy and cca <dig> genes via the unknown factor "x", and is in turn repressed by lhy/cca <dig>  <cit> . the loop i associates with loop ii via the prr1/toc <dig> gene and with loop iii via lhy/cca <dig> genes  <cit> . loop ii is made up of prr1/toc <dig> and an unknown factor "y". it has been proposed that the unknown factor "y" is gigantea and/or prr <dig>  although the true component has not yet been identified  <cit> . loop iii consists of lhy/cca <dig> genes and two prr genes, prr <dig> and prr <dig>  together, the gene families prrs and lhy/cca1s have key roles and form the complex regulatory network in the plant clock system.

clock-associated prr genes are conserved among angiosperm evolutionary lineages as are their partner lhy/cca <dig> genes  <cit> . in eudicotyledonous plants, five copies of prr genes have been identified in a. thaliana and carica papaya and seven copies have been found in populus trichocarpa  <cit> . in monocotyledonous plants, oryza sativa has five prr genes  <cit> . the expression patterns of prr genes in a. thaliana and o. sativa share some common features. the five prr genes in a. thaliana show diurnal and sequential-temporal expression patterns from dawn to dusk as follows; prr9→prr7→prr5→prr3→prr <dig>  <cit> . the similar sequential expression pattern is found in homologous genes of o. sativa, which are expressed as follows; osprr <dig> →osprr <dig> →osprr <dig>  <cit> . in spite of these similarities in the copy numbers and the expression patterns of clock-associated prr genes, it is still unclear how the prr genes have evolved in monocots and eudicots and how they have been incorporated in the regulatory network of the clock system in the evolutionary history of plants.

rapid accumulation of genomic sequence data offers new perspectives on the molecular phylogeny of genes in angiosperms  <cit> . completion of genomic sequences for various plant species reveals that angiosperm genomes have undergone several ancient chromosomal or whole genome duplication events  <cit> . in monocot lineages, the ρ polyploidy event occurred before the speciation of o. sativa and sorghum bicolor in commelinids  <cit> . on the other hand, four polyploidy events appear to have occurred in eudicot lineages. among these polyploidy events, the γ triplication event took place near the base of the eudicot clade though the timing of this event is still being debated  <cit> . the draft genomic sequence analysis of c. papaya has revealed that the genome of a. thaliana underwent two polyploidy events  after the speciation of c. papaya and a. thaliana in eurosids ii  <cit> . furthermore, the β polyploidy event is thought to have occurred before the α event  <cit> . in eurosids i, the salicoid polyploidy event occurred within the salicaceae lineages, which includes populus  <cit> . the footprints of these chromosomal duplication events are the conserved order of the genes on the duplicated chromosomes in the present genomic sequences  <cit> . thus, comparison of the order of genes surrounding duplicated genes provides molecular evolutionary information on their phylogenetic relationships  <cit> .

in the present study, to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among angiosperm prr genes, we  identified prr genes using available genomic databases of eudicots  and monocots  and  examined the evolutionary processes of angiosperm prr genes by conventional phylogenetic reconstruction and examination of syntenic relationships. with these results, we reconstructed the molecular phylogeny of prr genes in angiosperms and found that gene expansion of prrs occurred via polyploidy events in monocots and eudicots. taken together with the molecular phylogeny of the other major gene family of the plant clock system   <cit> , our data allow us to explore the evolutionary history of the multiple feedback loop system in angiosperm lineages.

RESULTS
identification of clock-associated prr genes in angiosperms
there are five copies of the prr genes in the genomes of o. sativa, s. bicolor, v. vinifera and c. papaya, six copies in a. thaliana, and eight copies in p. trichocarpa . the prr1/toc <dig> gene in c. papaya was not retrieved from the genomic sequence database because the nucleotide sequence of the c-terminal region of the gene has not yet been determined. the angiosperm prr genes retained a highly conserved pr-domain at the n-terminus and a cct-motif at the c-terminus . however, two prr-like genes  retained the cct-motif but not the pr-domain . thus, we examined the molecular phylogeny of prr genes but excluded atprr9b and ptprr5c in the present study.

phylogenetic analysis of prr gene family
to deduce the evolutionary relationships among prr genes in angiosperms, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the minimum evolution  method. angiosperm prr genes clearly separated into three clades  . this classification was consistent with the categorization of genomic structures of prr genes that was apparent when exon-intron structures and insertions/deletions variation were examined . we found that each clade contains genes from both eudicots and monocots, suggesting that ancient prr gene diverged into three clades before the speciation of monocots and eudicots.

in all plant species examined, one copy of the prr1/toc <dig> gene was retained in the prr1/toc <dig> clade , whereas at least two copies were found in the prr <dig> and  <dig> clade and the prr <dig> and  <dig> clade. prr1/toc <dig> genes diverged into two clusters representing monocots and eudicots.

the prr <dig> and  <dig> clade consisted of two different clusters, each of which exclusively consists of monocot or eudicot genes . accordingly, the phylogenetic tree suggested that the gene duplication events producing monocotyledonous prr <dig> and prr <dig> or eudicotyledonous prr <dig> and prr <dig> occurred independently within monocot and eudicot lineages, respectively. after the gene duplication event in eudicots, orthologs of p. trichocarpa prr <dig> appeared to be lost, whereas the p. trichocarpa prr <dig> gene was duplicated into prr7a and 7b.

in the prr <dig> and  <dig> clade, the monocot prr <dig> and prr <dig> genes showed an earlier gene duplication that may have occurred in a common ancestor of monocots and eudicots . however, the bootstrap value supporting this branch was not very high, 56%. eudicotyledonous prr <dig> and prr9/9-like  genes formed a cluster in the phylogenetic tree. in this cluster, a. thaliana prr <dig> was distantly related to other prr <dig> and prr9l genes, which was also observed in the phylogenetic trees reconstructed by the neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood and bayesian methods . this topology within prr <dig> and  <dig> clade might be the artefact caused by faster substitution rate of the atprr <dig> gene. otherwise, sparse taxonomic sampling obscures the additional gene duplication and loss events occurred in eudicots. prr5a in p. trichocarpa was more closely related to prr5b than other prr <dig>  and similar close relationship was found between prr9la and prr9lb in p. trichocarpa . these findings indicated that the gene duplication events that produced prr5a and 5b and prr9la and 9lb occurred within rosids. collectively, although the prr <dig> and  <dig> clade and the prr <dig> and  <dig> clade contained at least two copies of prr genes in both monocots and eudicots, prrs in the two clades are assumed to have independently duplicated in monocot and eudicot lineages.

functional divergence among prr gene clusters
clock associated-prr genes were divided into the three gene clusters  that had been formed prior to the speciation of monocots and eudicots. although the amino acid sequences of the genes were highly conserved in the pr-domain and cct-motif, there were several amino acid changes that were distinctive among the three clades, which potentially contribute to functional differences . to detect amino acid substitutions that are potentially involved in functional divergence among the clades in pr-domain, cct-motif and their flanking regions, we performed statistical analysis to estimate the coefficient of type i and type ii functional divergences . in the type i functional divergence, sites are conserved in one gene cluster but variable in the sister clusters  <cit> . on the other hand, type ii sites are fixed in both clusters but the amino acid residues are different between the clusters  <cit> . in the comparison among the prr gene clusters, all of the coefficients for the type i functional divergence  were significantly larger than zero . in addition, the values of the type ii functional divergence  between prr1/toc <dig> clade and prr <dig> and  <dig> clade and between prr1/toc <dig> clade and prr <dig> and  <dig> clade were significantly different from zero while the value between prr <dig> and  <dig> clade and prr <dig> and  <dig> clade was not significantly greater than zero. six sites that were above the empirical cutoff values were identified in the comparison between prr1/toc <dig> clade and prr <dig> and  <dig> clade, ten sites in prr1/toc <dig> clade and prr <dig> and  <dig> clade and two sites in prr <dig> and  <dig> clade and prr <dig> and  <dig> clade . intriguingly, these sites were predominantly detected in the pr-domain and its flanking region rather than the cct-motif . these results imply that the amino acid substitutions in the pr-domain, through which prr proteins interact with other proteins   <cit> , may partially contribute to the functional divergence among the three gene clusters.

phylogenetic relationships of prr gene family inferred from chromosome syntenies
to clarify evolutionary events such as gene duplication and gene deletion among angiosperm prr genes, we investigated chromosomal syntenies among the genomes of monocots or eudicots. because ancient chromosome duplication events result in conserved gene order on the duplicated chromosomes  <cit> , comparisons of gene organization and detection of chromosomal syntenies can provide molecular evolutionary information to understand the phylogenetic relationships of the genes  <cit> .

in eudicots, the flanking region of prr1/toc <dig>  prr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in a. thaliana showed a syntenic relationship with prr1/toc <dig>  prr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 9l in v. vinifera, p. trichocarpa, and c. papaya, respectively . in addition, the syntenies were also found in the flanking regions between atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig>  atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig>  atprr <dig> and vvprr9l and atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig> . the former syntenic relationships between atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig>  atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig>  atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig> and atprr <dig> and vvprr9l were more conserved than the latter relationships between atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig>  atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig>  atprr <dig> and vvprr9l and atprr <dig> and vvprr <dig>  respectively. syntenic relationships were not found between the neighbouring regions of p. trichocarpa prr1/toc <dig> and those of other prr1/toc1s, or between the neighbouring region of c. papaya prr9l and those of other prr9/9ls. it is not clear whether these observations can be ascribed to chromosomal rearrangements or fragmentations of genomic sequences in small contigs.

in the genome of a. thaliana, the flanking regions of prr genes showed syntenies with one or three partial regions of its genome . these syntenic relationships originated from the chromosomal duplications that arose from the β and α polyploidy events  <cit> . in the p. trichocarpa genome, two copies of each prr <dig>  prr <dig>  and prr9l gene were located at the syntenic regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> , those of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> , and those of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. tuskan et al.,  <cit>  showed that these syntenic regions were produced via the salicoid polyploidy event. although flanking region of a. thaliana prr <dig> shares syntenic relationships with partial regions of p. trichocarpa chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  these two partial regions did not retain a prr gene .

next, we investigated the chromosomal syntenic relationships derived from the γ triplication event using the genomic information of v. vinifera  <cit> . there were chromosomal syntenies conserved between the flanking regions of vvprr <dig> and vvprr <dig> and between the flanking regions of vvprr <dig> and vvprr9l, which were originated from the γ triplication event . the synteny of prr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 9l in v. vinifera and homologous genes in other eudicotyledonous plants , respectively, suggest that the ancestral prr3/ <dig> gene in eudicots was duplicated into prr <dig> and prr <dig>  and prr5/ <dig> into prr <dig> and prr9/9l in the γ polyploidy event . after the γ polyploidy event, one copy of each prr gene  has been conserved in the present genomes of v. vinifera and c. papaya, which apparently have not undergone additional polyploidy events. although a. thaliana prr genes were repeatedly duplicated by the β and/or α polyploidy events, one copy of each gene remains in the present a. thaliana genome, which is similar to v. vinifera and c. papaya genomes . in the genome of p. trichocarpa, prr <dig>   <dig>  and 9l were duplicated in the subsequent salicoid polyploidy event, but the prr <dig> was lost prior to the salicoid polyploidy event or duplicated prr3s were lost following the polyploidy event.

the flanking region of the prr gene in o. sativa  showed conserved synteny with that of orthologous genes in s. bicolor  <cit> . on the other hand, only a few syntenic regions were identified between prr <dig> of o. sativa and the orthologous gene of s. bicolor. in the genome of o. sativa, the neighbouring region of osprr <dig> showed synteny with that of osprr <dig>  this syntenic relationship resulted from the chromosomal duplication that occurred in the ρ polyploidy event  <cit> . the ρ polyploidy event also resulted in conserved chromosomal synteny between the flanking region of osprr <dig> and a partial region of chromosome  <dig>  and between the flanking region of osprr <dig> and a different partial region of chromosome  <dig>  however, these partial regions of chromosome  <dig> have lost prr genes . these results indicated that the gene duplication event resulting in prr <dig> and prr <dig> was the monocotyledonous ρ polyploidy event, and that prr <dig> and prr <dig> were duplicated via the ρ polyploidy event but one of the duplicated genes was lost from genomes of o. sativa and s. bicolor .

discussion
the plant clock system consists of multiple interlocked feedback loops, which are comprised predominantly of two gene families, lhy/cca1s and prrs  <cit> . these gene families are conserved among both monocots and eudicots  <cit> . to clarify the evolutionary process of the plant clock system, we recently reported the molecular phylogeny of lhy/cca <dig> genes in angiosperms  <cit> . furthermore, in the present study, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among clock-associated prr genes in monocots and eudicots using two approaches: reconstruction of phylogenetic trees and examination of syntenic relationships. together, these phylogenetic analyses of the plant circadian clock related-genes, lhy/cca1s and prrs, are promising tools to unravel the evolutionary history of the plant clock system among angiosperm lineages.

evolutionary processes of clock-associated prr genes in angiosperms
prr genes are conserved in angiosperms and at least five copies of prr genes have been retained in their genomes . angiosperm prr genes are grouped into three clades  that have already existed prior to the divergence of monocots and eudicots . after the speciation of monocots and eudicots, copy numbers of prr genes independently increased in each lineage as a result of ancient chromosomal duplication events . in monocots, the ancestral prr37/prr <dig> was duplicated into prr <dig> and prr <dig> in the ρ polyploidy event that occurred before the speciation of o. sativa and s. bicolor  <cit> . in eudicots, the gene duplication events between prr <dig> and prr <dig> and between prr <dig> and prr9/9l are derived from the γ polyploidy event that took place before the speciation of vitales  and eurosid species   <cit> . in addition, our results show that prr genes in p. trichocarpa have expanded more than those in other plant species . this expansion apparently resulted from the salicoid polyploidy event that occurred in the populus lineage but not in other eudicots  . consequently, circadian clocks may have become more intricate networks after the speciation of monocots and eudicots if the additional genes have roles in the circadian networks.

in contrast to the increase in prr genes via ancient chromosomal duplication events, the present genome of a. thaliana retains one copy of each prr gene  after β and α polyploidy events . likewise, in brassica rapa, prr genes that were increased in a recent hexaploidization event have been reduced in its genome following the event, though the genome retains at least a set of prr genes  <cit> . these results implied that dosages of the clock related-genes had been altered in the genomes during evolution. since some reports showed that a gene dosage change of clock related genes influenced the clock regulatory network and downstream signals  <cit> , plants may have flexibly modulated the complex network of the clock system after polyploidy events and subsequent gene deletion events. indeed, allopolyploid arabidopsis species can fine-tune a regulatory and stoichiometric balance of the circadian clock system to properly maintain a downstream homeostasis of the plants  <cit> . the history of gene duplications and deletions in the arabidopsis clock system imply that the regulatory network of the clock system has maintained a degree of organization throughout the dynamic changes of copy numbers and functions of clock-related genes.

phylogenetic footprint of the plant clock system in angiosperms
loops i and iii of the arabidopsis clock system contain four prr genes  and two lhy/cca <dig> genes    <cit> . although the circadian clock-related genes in a. thaliana were duplicated via the β and α polyploidy events, the present genome of a. thaliana retains only one pair of lhy and cca <dig> genes, which is derived from the β polyploidy event   <cit> . as the β polyploidy event is assumed to have occurred in the brassicaceae, lhy and cca <dig> genes did not diverge before the speciation of a. thaliana and c. papaya, which is consistent with the fact that there is only one copy of the lhy/cca <dig> gene in the genome of c. papaya  <cit> . similar to the genome of a. thaliana, the c. papaya genome retained only one copy each of the prr1/toc <dig>  prr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes . these results suggest that one copy of lhy/cca <dig>  prr1/toc <dig>  prr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> was involved in the plant clock system in the common ancestor of a. thaliana and c. papaya.

the evolutionary history of the plant clock system in two divergent members of brassicales  raises the question as to when the arabidopsis-type clock apparatus arose in the evolutionary history of plants. phylogenies of the circadian clock-related genes showed that a set of the genes, one copy of each lhy/cca <dig>  prr1/toc <dig>  prr <dig>   <dig> and 9l genes, is conserved in the genome of v. vinifera   <cit> . conservation of the set of clock-related genes suggests that the fundamental mechanism of the arabidopsis-type clock apparatus was formed before the speciation of vitales  and eurosid species , although it remains to be determined whether functional divergences between prr <dig> and  <dig> and between prr <dig> and 9/9l, which were duplicated in the γ triplication event, existed in the common ancestor of vitales and eurosids .

intriguingly, the clock system of p. trichocarpa might differ from the arabidopsis clock system, because the p. trichocarpa prr <dig> gene was lost and lhy/cca <dig> and prr <dig> and  <dig> were duplicated via the salicoid polyploidy event that occurred after the speciation of eurosids i and ii . prr <dig> protein in a. thaliana interacts with prr1/toc <dig> protein, which is a component of the main loop , to inhibit its protein degradation  <cit> . the lack of prr <dig> in populus might influence the posttranslational regulation of prr1/toc <dig> protein or might be compensated by recruiting other prr genes although conserved changes that would mark the prr <dig> gene cluster were not identified in other populus prr proteins . furthermore, duplication of lhy/cca <dig> and prr <dig> and  <dig>  but not prr1/toc <dig>  could also affect the regulation mechanism of the populus clock system, because a dosage balance in the plant clock system was ruined  <cit> . we recently revealed that populus lhys show typical diurnal expressions similar to lhy/cca <dig> genes in other plant species  <cit> , which is apparently contradictory to the speculation. the populus clock system appears to retain a functional regulatory network in regard to the expression regulation of the lhy genes throughout the evolutionary changes of the circadian clock components.

the monocots o. sativa and s. bicolor retain one lhy/cca <dig> gene and five prr genes in their genomes   <cit> . phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene duplication events that produced prr <dig> and  <dig>  and prr <dig> and  <dig> in monocots occurred separately and independently of the events that produced prr <dig> and  <dig>  and prr <dig> and  <dig> in eudicots . this finding raises a complex question; what are the roles of these paralogous genes in the monocotyledonous clock system? the expression of prr <dig> in a. thaliana is not regulated by light signals and reaches a peak of the diurnal rhythm around  <dig> h after dawn  <cit> . on the other hand, prr <dig> in a. thaliana shows a light response expression, resulting in rhythmicity with peak expression just after dawn  <cit> . prr <dig> and  <dig> in o. sativa have peak expressions around  <dig> h after dawn and are not induced by light signals  <cit> , which appear to be more similar to the regulation of a. thaliana prr <dig> expression than to that of a. thaliana prr <dig> expression. in addition, peak expressions of o. sativa prr <dig> and  <dig> are followed by expressions of prp <dig> and  <dig>  which may correspond to the sequential expression pattern of a. thaliana prr <dig> and prr <dig>  <cit> . these results collectively suggest that paralogous gene pairs prr59/ <dig> and prr37/ <dig> genes in monocots share functional roles with prr <dig> and prr <dig>  respectively, in a. thaliana . together, these data indicate that a common ancestor of monocots and eudicots may have had a main feedback loop  that was not posttranslationally regulated by prr <dig>  although the ancestral clock system appears to have been more simplified than that of the current arabidopsis-type clock apparatus, it is assumed that the ancestral clock system have had the basic components reconstructing a primitive multiple feedback loop system.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study inferred the molecular phylogeny of angiosperm prr genes that have key roles in the plant clock system. clock-associated prr genes diverged into three clades before the speciation of monocots and eudicots and, in addition, prr3/ <dig> and prr5/ <dig> underwent independent expansion in monocots and eudicots . taken together with the molecular phylogeny of lhy/cca <dig> genes  <cit> , our studies suggest that the basic components of the arabidopsis clock were established prior to the speciation of eudicots and monocots . additional functional analyses and accumulation of genomic information from other plant species will clarify details of evolutionary and developmental processes of plant clock systems.
