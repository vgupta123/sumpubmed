BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive pathogen responsible for serious diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, acute otitis media and sepsis. although vaccination campaigns have been useful at decreasing the prevalence of the most frequent serotypes, the appearance and spread of drug-resistant isolates not included in the initial vaccine formulations are now threatening our capacity at dealing with these infections  <cit> . the increase in resistance to several classes of antimicrobials due to the clonal spread of few multidrug resistant isolates further worsens the situation. fortunately, surveillance studies revealed that every strains of s. pneumoniae tested were sensitive to linezolid   <cit> , the first approved member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics. lnz inhibits the formation of protein synthesis initiation complexes by binding to the central loop segment of domain v of the 23s rrna  <cit> . recent cross-linking and crystallography experiments further revealed that lnz binds near the catalytic center of the 50s ribosomal subunit and possibly interferes with the placement of the aminoacyl-trna  <cit> . lnz is highly effective against a number of clinically important gram-positive pathogens like staphylococcus aureus and its methicillin-resistant version , enterococci and their vancomycin-resistant versions , and s. pneumoniae  <cit> . still, s. pneumoniae and streptococcus oralis isolates with reduced susceptibility to linezolid  have been already reported  <cit>  and the emergence of resistance is unfortunately likely.

resistance to linezolid in gram-positive bacteria was shown to be associated with key mutations in the domain v of 23s rrna or in the ribosomal proteins l <dig> and l <dig>  <cit> . although several mutations have been pinpointed, the g2576t transversion in 23s rrna  is the most frequently observed  <cit>  and was shown to occur in clinical isolates of s. aureus  <cit> , s. epidermidis  <cit> , s. hominis  <cit> , s. simulans  <cit>  and in enterococci  <cit>  resistant to linezolid. there are four to six gene copies of 23s rrna in most gram-positive pathogens, and the level of lnz resistance as well as the fitness cost usually correlates with the number of mutated copies  <cit> . the domain v of 23s rrna is the binding site of other translation inhibitors like chloramphenicol, florfenicol and quinupristin-dalfopristin, and the g2576t mutation was shown to confer cross-resistance to these antibiotics. a six base pair deletion in the ribosomal protein l <dig> of s. pneumoniae isolates resistant to chloramphenicol was also shown to be associated with non-susceptibility to lnz  <cit> , and mutations in ribosomal proteins l <dig>  <cit> , l <dig>  <cit>  and l <dig>  <cit>  were further observed in other lnz-resistant gram-positive bacteria. high levels of resistance to lnz were shown to be conferred by a plasmid-borne methyltransferase  involved in ribosomal protection  <cit>  and recent outbreaks of lnz-resistant s. epidermidis and s. aureus have been associated with the clonal spread of cfr-containing strains  <cit> .

whole genome sequencing of laboratory generated lnz-resistant s. pneumoniae recently revealed mutations in several genes, three of which  were implicated in resistance to lnz  <cit> . several other mutations were not studied. to improve our understanding of the role of these mutations in lnz resistance, we used a whole genome transformation approach to reconstruct resistance. dna extracted from lnz-resistant mutants was serially transformed in sensitive isolates and the genomes of these transformants were sequenced. we found that the selection of lnz resistance is accompanied by the acquisition of resistance determinants that confer a fitness cost and of compensatory mutations that partially alleviates the growth defect of the resistant strains.

RESULTS
the genome sequence of three independent in vitro-selected lnz-resistant s. pneumoniae mutants  previously revealed the presence of several mutations  <cit> , but the role in resistance had only been studied for some of these. for a more global understanding of the genetic variations associated with resistance to lnz, we studied a new resistant strain named 1974m <dig> . the transformation of high molecular weight dna extracted from 1974m <dig> into s. pneumoniae sensitive strains followed by the selection of the transformants under lnz pressure should allow discriminating the mutations actually involved in resistance from bystander mutations that may have been randomly selected during the selection process. a total of three rounds of transformation of 1974m <dig> genomic dna were required to fully reconstruct the high level lnz resistance of 1974m <dig> into the s. pneumoniae  <dig> background  . we also used a similar strategy of transforming the genomic dna of 1974m <dig> into the r <dig> strain but despite several attempts we could not reach a lnz mic higher than  <dig> μg/ml  . considering the higher initial lnz mic of  <dig> compared to r <dig>  the fold-increase in resistance was the same between the last two transformants .

in order to identify the mutations that had been transferred to 1974t <dig> and r6t <dig>  the genome sequences of the parent mutant 1974m <dig> and of both transformants were determined by  <dig> pyrosequencing. more than 97% of the reads of 1974m <dig>  r6t <dig> and 1974t <dig> assembled into  <dig> to  <dig> large contigs covering more than 98% of the genome with mean depth coverage of 20x. while we cannot exclude having missed some point mutations, we were capable of fully reconstructing resistance using both a whole genome approach  and a targeted approach . of the fifteen mutations identified in the 1974m <dig> mutant , six mutations were transferred into both 1974t <dig> and r6t <dig> transformants . these included the g2576t transversion observed in the four copies of the 23s rrna and missense mutations in the l <dig> and l <dig> ribosomal proteins. the only other 1974m <dig> mutation to be transferred was a g to t transversion that specifically occurred  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the start codon of spr <dig> in the 1974t <dig> transformant . no spontaneous mutations occurred during the selection of the transformant bacteria.

the targeted sequencing of transformants isolated at different rounds of transformation  revealed that the acquisition of mutations in 23s rrna began during the first round of transformation in both r <dig> and  <dig> genetic backgrounds while the mutations in the l <dig> and l <dig> ribosomal proteins or upstream of spr <dig> only occurred during the second and third rounds of transformation . the acquisition of mutations in the 23s rrna is a well established lnz resistance determinant and the serial transformation of mutated 23s rrna gene copies also translated into a stepwise increase in lnz resistance in s. pneumoniae r <dig> in addition to increase cross-resistance to chloramphenicol and florfenicol but not to penicillin . we were never able to select for unique integration events of the g2576t mutation in the  <dig> background however, as it was always acquired by the four copies of 23s rrna at the same time . nonetheless, this led to similar fold increase in lnz resistance than in s. pneumoniae r <dig>  and was also linked to chloramphenicol and florfenicol cross-resistance . the missense mutations in the 50s ribosomal proteins l <dig>  and l <dig>  of 1974m <dig> appear to require a specific genetic background for resistance as they were only able to decrease lnz susceptibility when transformed into a strain in which the four copies of 23s rrna were mutated   and not when transformed into wt strains of s. pneumoniae r <dig>  or  <dig> .

the 23s rrna genes and the rrna methyltransferase spr <dig> were the only mutated genes common to 1974m <dig> and three other s. pneumoniae lnz-resistant strains described previously  <cit>  . the only other mutations acquired in common by 1974m <dig> and at least one of these other mutants were a g to t transversion in the promoter regions of the atp-binding cassette  genes spr <dig> and spr <dig> . of these, only the 23s rrna and spr <dig> mutations were transferred to r6t <dig> and/or 1974t <dig> . when the mutations in or upstream of spr <dig>  spr <dig> or spr <dig> were specifically transformed into wt backgrounds of s. pneumoniae r <dig>  or s. pneumoniae  <dig> , only the mutation upstream of spr <dig> was able to increase lnz resistance and this was correlated with its overexpression . similarly to sensitive isolates, only the mutation linked to spr <dig> changed the lnz susceptibility values when transformed into the t- <dig> cells .

the acquisition of lnz resistance conferred a growth defect to the 1974m <dig> mutant   and growth kinetic experiments revealed that this was due to several mutations associated with resistance to lnz. indeed, the growth of the t- <dig> transformant harboring four altered copies of 23s rrna was retarded compared to its  <dig> parent , even when compared to the 1974m <dig> mutant  . this growth defect was further enhanced by the mutation located within the rrna methytransferase spr <dig>  and by the mutation leading to the overexpression of the abc gene spr <dig> . the fitness cost conferred by these last two mutations required a background of altered 23s rrna however, as their transformation failed to affect the growth of s. pneumoniae  <dig> wt . in contrast, we found that most 1974m <dig> mutations that could not be directly linked to lnz resistance by transformation experiments or the mutations that failed to be transferred to the r6t <dig> and 1974t <dig> transformants acted as compensatory mutations involved in increasing the growth fitness of the 1974m <dig> mutant. notably, the mutations in the genes coding for the ribosomal protein l <dig>  and the mutation leading to the overexpression of the abc gene spr <dig>  were able to compensate in part for the fitness cost associated with altered copies of 23s rrna . the mutation upstream of spr <dig> was further able to compensate the growth defect conferred by the mutation of the rna methyltransferase spr <dig> and by the overexpression of the abc gene spr <dig>  . mutations can thus be involved in either resistance, fitness compensation, or both.

discussion
lnz is a member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit translation initiation by targeting the domain v of the 23s rrna. although resistance to lnz in clinical settings is rare, and so far absent in the case of s. pneumoniae  <cit> , the analysis of lnz-resistant strains revealed the 23s rrna g2576t mutation to be a major resistance determinant. other mutations can still be implicated in resistance however, as described in lnz-resistant enterococci, staphylococci and s. pneumoniae  <cit> . recent advances in dna sequencing technology make possible the study at the whole-genome level of the genetic bases implicated in the mode of action and resistance mechanisms of drugs  <cit> . to pinpoint the mutations most relevant to lnz resistance, we sequenced a new s. pneumoniae strain, 1974m <dig>  and two s. pneumoniae lnz-resistant transformants generated by whole genome serial transformation of lnz-sensitive strains with genomic dna isolated from highly lnz-resistant mutants.

we first concentrated on recurrent mutations transferred to both transformants as we hypothesized that these would be the most likely to be responsible for resistance. as reported in other bacterial species  <cit> , the g2576t 23s rrna mutation is also key for lnz resistance in s. pneumoniae. similarly to staphylococcus and enterococci  <cit> , the level of resistance to lnz in s. pneumoniae r <dig> correlates with the number of mutated gene copies of 23s rrna. the same gene dosage effect was also observed for the level of cross-resistance to chloramphenicol and florfenicol, two other translation inhibitors acting at the level of domain v of 23s rrna  <cit> . in s. pneumoniae  <dig>  the four mutated copies were always simultaneously acquired during the targeted transformation of 23s rrna pcr fragments . whether this is due to strain-specific features remains to be established.

the acquisition of 23s rrna g2576t mutations conferred a biological cost to the s. pneumoniae 1974m <dig> mutant . reduced fitness is a frequent outcome associated with antibiotic resistance  <cit>  and the acquisition of mutations in the primary targets of fluoroquinolones   <cit>  and β-lactams   <cit>  were also shown to confer a growth defect in s. pneumoniae resistant mutants. compensatory mutations occurring either within the genes responsible for resistance or at distinct sites were shown to increase the fitness of the resistant strains, and can even help in achieving higher levels of resistance  <cit> . mutations in 50s ribosomal proteins have been observed in lnz-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae and s. aureus  <cit>  and the selection of a y137h mutation in the l <dig> ribosomal protein  of 1974m <dig> is consistent with the reduced lnz susceptibility previously reported to be conferred by the f147l mutation in ribosomal protein l <dig> of s. epidermidis   <cit> . this mutation failed to directly translate into enhanced levels of lnz resistance when transferred into r <dig> wt cells  however, although it seems to be implicated in resistance when l <dig> is mutated and in a context where 23s rrna is mutated at position g2576t . in addition, these mutations are also able to compensate for the growth defect conferred by the 23s rrna g2576t mutation . crystallographic studies of the 50s ribosomal subunit have shown that several ribosomal proteins contain extensions approaching 23s rrna bases near the peptidyltransferase center , and a critical subset of these proteins includes the l <dig> and l <dig> proteins  <cit> . although they are not part of the ptc per se, mutations at residues close to the ptc in l <dig> and l <dig> ribosomal proteins could still be implicated in releasing constraints associated with the acquisition of the unfavorable g2576t 23s rrna mutation by altering the conformation and/or stability of the ptc through changes in second- and third-shell interactions. this could explain the frequent acquisition of ribosomal protein mutations following selection of resistance to lnz in different bacterial species  <cit> . the l <dig> and l <dig> mutation together conferred increased sensitivity to chloramphenicol and florfenicol however , which could be explained by distinct 23s rrna binding sites compared to lnz  <cit> .

the selection of a single nucleotide mutation leading to the overexpression of the abc protein spr <dig>  in s. pneumoniae lnz-resistant mutants was shown to confer a small but significant increase in the level of resistance to lnz  <cit> . interestingly, we showed here that the increased expression of spr <dig> was also able to compensate for the fitness cost conferred by a number of lnz resistance determinants, including major resistance mechanisms like mutations in 23s rrnas and more specific ones like mutations in the rrna methyltransferase spr <dig> . the genome of s. pneumoniae encodes several abc proteins, some of which were shown to be involved in drug resistance  <cit> . as mutations at the primary target site  may lead to excessive concentrations of free lnz, the cell might require to increase the expression of abc efflux systems like spr <dig>  <cit>  to expel the excess of lnz. indeed, the decay of antibiotics was shown to generate degradation products displaying potential biological activities and to be detrimental to the strains having acquired primary resistance determinants  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the parent mutants had more mutations than the transformants , which suggests that long term step-by-step selection and growth may require additional mutations or that spurious neutral changes are occurring during the selection of resistance. the mutations identified here fully account for the level of lnz resistance of the mutant and some were found to compensate for a fitness cost. the combination of whole genome transformation and sequencing used here was useful for highlighting mutations playing a dual role in lnz resistance and fitness compensation.
