BACKGROUND
with advances in genome-wide gene expression technologies, classification of cancer subtypes based on expression signatures is widespread and results in many biomarkers for various cancers. this molecular signature-based approach is more objective and reproducible than conventional methods based on clinicopathological features. there are plenty of clinical applications that are actively being sought  <cit> . some of these are already in commercial use  <cit>  for selecting treatment strategies and predicting prognosis. in spite of the advantages and successful applications, the identification of causal oncogenic pathways and driver-regulators remains a challenge  <cit> . the main bottleneck is that expression signatures normally consist of cancer drivers and passengers with the latter as not directly related to cancer progression. the reason for this is that passengers frequently take the majority of the signature gene and an accurate discrimination of cancer drivers from passengers becomes a key subject in cancer genomic studies.

regulatory network modeling has been widely used for a systematic understanding of disease progression at the molecular level, particularly for cancer   <cit> . recently, carro et al. applied a reverse engineering method for context-specific transcriptional regulatory networks to  <dig> gene expression profiles from high-grade glioblastoma  patients. two tfs  were successfully identified as master regulators and control ‘mesenchymal’ signature genes that lead to tumor aggressiveness such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and neo-angiogenesis  <cit> . they applied the aracne algorithm for global reconstruction of regulatory network  <cit> , where directed or causal tf-target relationship was extracted from measuring conditional mutual information. then, the regulatory tfs for the mesenchymal signature genes were inferred from the use of master regulator analysis  together with or without stepwise linear regression method . this provides an exemplary case to pinpoint upstream regulators of known cancer signatures as cancer drivers and, accordingly, to a promising therapeutic target. further, this strategy also provides a chance to develop biomarkers of even smaller sizes than the original signature, which is highly desirable for practical usage in terms of cost and interpretation.

in this study, we used carro et al.  <cit>  as the framework of our analysis and applied the same method to colorectal cancer with only minor modifications. colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in males and the third in females worldwide  <cit> . several research groups have identified prognostic molecular signatures that use genome-wide gene expression profiles of colorectal cancer patients  <cit> . recently, oh et al. classified  <dig> colorectal patients into two groups from the use of global gene expression profiles and extracted  <dig> signature genes  that were differentially expressed between the two groups. this gene signature shows a good prognostic ability to discriminate colorectal cancer patients between good and poor prognostic groups with high accuracy  <cit> . we reasoned that the upstream regulators or transcription factors  of these prognostic signatures might take a critical role as driver or master regulator to provide clues on the underlying regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic applications. here, we applied a reverse engineering algorithm to reconstruct an unbiased transcriptional network from colorectal cancer. using this network, the upstream regulators of the prognostic signatures were identified and tested for their utility as prognostic markers. our network models provide clues on the potential regulatory mechanisms for these upstream regulators that may cause prognostic differences.

RESULTS
overview of the analytic procedure
our analytic procedure followed that of carro et al.  <cit> . in the study, a global regulatory network was inferred from high-grade glioblastoma . the difference was that we focused on modeling regulatory networks only for the  <dig> prognostic marker genes in colorectal cancer reported by oh et al.  <cit> . from the use of the network model, we then extracted their upstream regulators or tfs and tested their prognostic ability in comparison with the original  <dig> signature genes.

as the detail of mathematical formulation is described from the previous work  <cit>  and the methods section, we briefly summarize our overall procedures . once a global regulatory network was constructed using the aracne algorithm, regulons or tf targets are extracted for all candidate tfs. top candidate tfs were chosen based on the coverage of signatures as downstream regulated genes . this procedure or master regulator analysis  is equal to conventional gene set analysis  based on the fisher exact test. alternatively, we applied a stepwise linear regression method  for each signature gene and its expression was modeled using a minimal set of candidate tfs. in our case, slr was used only to filter out weak tf-target relations in each regulon and to keep the most obvious interactions modeled by simple linear equations. in contrast, carro et al. expanded the candidate tfs before the application of slr by including additional  <dig> tfs with their promoter sequences enriched among the signature genes  <cit> . therefore, our study is more suitable to evaluate whether a regulatory model can successfully identify key upstream regulators  purely based on expression profiles without depending on external knowledge.

construction of regulatory networks and identification of upstream regulators for prognostic signatures
first, we took the  <dig> expression profiles from colon cancer patients from moffit cancer center . they were also used to extract the  <dig> prognostic signature genes for colorectal cancer. then the aracne algorithm was applied to infer a global transcriptional network. in total, we inferred  <dig>  tf-target interactions between  <dig> tfs and  <dig>  target genes in the context of colorectal cancer . in total,  <dig> regulons were extracted, each consisted of a tf and its target genes . for the  <dig> regulons, we applied mra, which tests significant overlap between the regulons and the  <dig> signature genes . mra identified  <dig> tfs, of which targets significantly overlap with the signature at a false discovery rate  <  <dig>  . the  <dig> tfs collectively regulate  <dig> of the  <dig> signature genes .

we further applied slr to the regulons identified by mra. in this step, the expression level of each signature gene was modeled by the linear combination of the expression levels of its upstream tfs in the network. the reason that the slr method tries to minimize the number of tfs in modeling the expression level of each signature gene is that only the tfs showing strong linear correlation tend to remain in the final regression model. accordingly, slr was essentially used as a filtering step to remove less effective tf-target interactions .

the tfs were ranked by the order of signature coverage, i.e. the number of signature genes regulated by corresponding tf. in mra and mra + slr method, the first  <dig> tfs covered most of the  <dig> signature genes. in mra, the coverage the top  <dig> tfs was  <dig> out of the  <dig> signature genes with the average number of target genes per tf =  <dig> . in case of mra + slr, the coverage was  <dig> out the  <dig> genes with  <dig>  target genes per tf. these two sets of top  <dig> tfs by mra and mra + slr method were chosen as candidate upstream regulators for further analysis and named as tfmra and tfmra+slr, respectively . the two tf sets largely agreed to each other with  <dig> tfs in common . three tfs were specific for mra  and mra + slr , respectively. we constructed two versions of regulatory networks between the top  <dig> upstream regulators  and their downstream targets among the  <dig> signature genes. additional file 1: table s <dig> lists the downstream signature genes of each tf. figure  <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig> visualizes networks for tfmra and tfmra+slr. notably, some transcription factors were linked by positive or negative regulatory interactions. ascl <dig> was positively regulated by two tfs  and negatively by spdef to suggest a higher order structure among the upstream regulators. many of the prognostic signature genes were co-regulated by several tfs, e.g. acsl <dig> by four tfs  and vav <dig> by three tfs .

prognostic effect analyses for the upstream regulators identified by mra and mra + slr
the  <dig> signature genes consisted of  <dig> low-risk and  <dig> high-risk marker genes that were significantly up and down-regulated, respectively, in the patient group of better survival  <cit> . accordingly, we assigned the prog-nostic effect of the  <dig> tfs as positive  or negative  class that depends on whether the majority of the downstream target genes are regulated in favor of expressing low-risk or high-risk signatures. first, we calculated spearman’s rank correlation between each tf and its downstream signature genes. the regulatory mode was determined by the sign of spearman’s rank correlation between a tf and its target, where positive correlation indicated ‘activation’ and negative did ‘repression’. the prognostic effect of a tf was assigned positive  if the sum of activated low-risk and repressed high-risk genes was more than half among its downstream signature genes. among the  <dig> tfs selected by mra, the prognostic effect of the  <dig> tfs was positive with the remaining  <dig> tfs being negative .

we focused on the top  <dig> tfs in tfmra and tfmra+slr and asked whether their prognostic effect is consistently observed across different data sources. however, the moffit cohort used for network construction by aracne, we took another set of gene expression profiles from royal melbourne hospital   <cit> . positive prognostic effect was observed in five out of the  <dig> tfs in tfmra and four in tfmra+slr in the moffit cohort . the rest five and six tfs showed negative prognostic effect, respectively. we observed exactly the same trend for all the tfs tested in the melbourne cohort to suggest that their regulatory interactions were consistently maintained in colorectal cancer .

strong association of the top  <dig> upstream tfs with the survival of colon cancer patients
now, we tested the utility of the upstream regulators  as prognostic markers for colorectal cancer. in the moffit cohort  used as the training dataset, tfmra and tfmra+slr showed a strong differential expression pattern between good and poor prognostic groups similar to the original  <dig> signature genes . an svm  classifier was constructed for tfmra, tfmra+slr, and the original  <dig> signature genes. for validation purposes, we took the melbourne cohort  as an independent test set. these  <dig> patients were classified into good or poor prognostic groups independently from the use of each of the three classifiers. for all three classifications, the resulting good and poor prognostic groups showed the same differential expression patterns in the test dataset .

we compared the prognostic performance of the three classifiers using the kaplan-meier plots for disease-free survival . the upstream tfs showed a slightly better or similar performance than the original  <dig> signature genes with the ordering of tfmra+slr > tfmra >  <dig> signature genes. the p-values by log-rank test were  <dig> ×10- <dig> for tfmra+slr,  <dig> ×10- <dig> for tfmra, and  <dig> ×10- <dig> for the  <dig> signature genes. we further inspected the prognostic performance over a range of signature sizes for the gene signatures as well as the tf signatures . overall, a stable prognostic utility was observed over a range of signature sizes for both tf-based methods . although the best prognosis was observed for the gene signature of size = 18 ~  <dig>  the tfs showed a reasonably good performance comparable to the  <dig> signature genes using the top 7– <dig> tfs by mra + slr and 10 ~  <dig> tfs by mra. notably, these upstream tfs were not selected directly for good  survival but by the coverage of known prognostic signatures in our regulatory network model based purely on expression profiles. therefore, the performances of tfmra and tfmra+slr are thought to be unexpectedly high, considering that the signature size dramatically decreased to less than 1/ <dig>  to demonstrate that upstream tfs can be even better prognostic markers than the expression signatures. the same strategy may be useful in identifying upstream regulators for other types of cancer signatures such as drug response and metastatic behavior.

candidate upstream regulators include many tfs involved in tumorigenesis: hif1a fosl <dig>  plagl <dig>  ascl <dig>  and tcf7
many of the upstream tfs for the prognostic signature genes are actually well known regulators for various tumorigenic processes such as cell invasion, metastasis, and clinical outcome. among the tfs of poor prognostic effect, hif1a and fosl <dig> are examples of such cases. our network models also recapitulate some of the known tf-target relations, as confirmed by the literature. hypoxia-inducible factors  are the key regulators of oxygen signaling pathway that respond to oxygen-deficient environment known as hypoxia. cancer cells overcome hypoxic conditions by hypoxic pathway activated by hifs. hif1a is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers  <cit>  including colon cancer  <cit> . among the nine targets of hif1a in our network by mra + slr, the three interactions are confirmed by the literature. hif1a activates cxcr <dig> and lox and are involved in metastasis in renal cell carcinoma  <cit>  and hypoxia-induced metastasis  <cit> , respectively. ptgs <dig>  is known to be directly up-regulated by hif1a and promotes hypoxia-induced angiogenesis  <cit> . in addition, ptgs <dig> is shown negatively regulated by ascl <dig>  one among the top  <dig> tfs in both networks. fosl <dig>  is a member of fos family, which encodes leucine zipper proteins forming ap- <dig> transcription factor complex together with jun family proteins. while fosl <dig> is included in the top  <dig> tfs only in tfmra, its rank is still relatively high in tfmra+slr . fosl <dig> is known to mediate cell growth and differentiation  <cit>  and its transgenic mice show a severe loss of small blood vessels in skin  <cit>  to suggest a role in angiogenesis. fosl <dig> also activates lox in our network by mra .

among the tfs of good prognostic effect, plagl <dig> is notable due to its dual functionality as proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor. plagl <dig> has been known as a proto-oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia , glioblastoma , and colorectal cancer  <cit> . plagl <dig> can activate wnt signaling that leads to leukemia in mice  <cit>  or suppression of cellular differentiation  <cit> . contrarily, plagl <dig> also functions as tumor suppressor that promotes apoptosis or arrests cell cycle  <cit> . ascl <dig> and tcf <dig>  are tfs activated by wnt signaling. ascl <dig> is up-regulated in colorectal adenocarcinoma  <cit>  and, until recently, growth arrests are observed by knockdown of ascl <dig> in vivo  <cit> ; although the prognostic effect of ascl <dig> was positive . tcf <dig> is a member of the tcf/lef family, which transmit the wnt signal into the nucleus and activate wnt target genes by interacting with β-catenin. unlike other members of tcf/lef family, tcf <dig> may act as negative regulators for wnt signaling because its isoforms lack a β-catenin binding domain, while retaining groucho interaction domain necessary for repressor activity  <cit> .

there is evidence that tumorigenic activity for other tfs such as prrx <dig>  and spdef . the gene fusion between prrx <dig> and nup <dig> was reported in aml  <cit> . suppressive activities for metastasis, cell growth, and migration are suggested for spdef  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we propose a genetic analysis pipeline to find transcriptional modules for prognostic gene expression signatures or other biomarkers. our method only requires expression profiles in the appropriate context such as tissue type or disease condition. this procedure was applied to identify key upstream regulators for the  <dig> prognostic signature genes for colorectal cancer. to this end, a global transcriptional network was constructed using the aracne algorithm  <cit> . candidate upstream regulators were selected based on the number of signature genes as downstream targets or regulons . an additional filter was applied to extract only strong tf-target interactions readily modeled by simple linear regression . as a result, we identified two sets of top  <dig> tfs that clearly discriminate between good and poor prognostic groups. the prognostic performance was tested using a dataset independent of signature selection and network modeling. these upstream tfs included many known regulators for tumorigenic processes such as metastasis and cell proliferation. the utility of our work is two-fold. the first is that it allows the identification of upstream regulators for a given set of signature genes and provides leads to regulatory mechanisms. the second is that these regulators may serve as better biomarkers by themselves than the original signature with markedly smaller sizes and better performance. the utility of our method may be expandable to other types of signatures such as diagnosis and drug response.
