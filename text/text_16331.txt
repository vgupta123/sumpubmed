BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer  is the stable transmission of genetic material between organisms without the use of vertical inheritance mechanisms, mitosis or meiosis  <cit> . hgt is common in bacteria and archaea and is considered an important force in their evolution . in eukaryotes hgt is considered to be rare but an increasing number of studies are reporting hgt events in eukaryotes, and it is now beginning to be considered as an important mechanism of eukaryotic evolution  <cit> . in fungi, hgt events have been correlated with the gain of pathogenicity traits  and with a gain of osmotrophic capacity  <cit> . genome-wide screens for hgt in fungi have also identified genes related to the metabolism of sugars, nitrogen, amino acids, nucleobases, and macromolecules as well as the acquisition of transporters and secreted proteins  <cit> .

the genetic mechanisms that are responsible for hgt are not well known. the nuclear envelope, the storage of dna in chromatin, rna interference systems, separate reproductive cell lines, gene promoter specificity, incompatibility of intron splicing systems, alternative gene codes and others represent barriers against hgt especially in distantly related species  . the mechanisms that make hgt possible across distantly related species are not well known. the transference of genetic material from the mitochondrion to the nuclear genome is one possible explanation of ancient hgt from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. fungi have a large number of plasmids both inside and outside of fungal mitochondria  <cit> , and have been implicated as the vector for this type of transfer  <cit> . transposons and viruses are also candidate vectors of hgt. these elements have the potential to transfer genetic material among distantly related species but only in a few cases is there strong evidence to support this type of transfer  <cit> . another mechanism is phagocytosis, the “you are what you eat” hypothesis which proposes that the predator–prey relationship could increase the chances of an hgt event in microorganisms  <cit> . beyond the vectors needed to achieve hgt, the ecological association of fungi with living and dead organisms may increase the chance of transmitting genetic material laterally .

a wide range of methods have been proposed to detect hgt including phylogenetic analysis, and the detection of bias in nucleotide composition and codon usage, using naïve bayes classifiers, correspondence analysis, or akaike information criterion clustering  <cit> . each method has its own strengths and weaknesses but in the case of ancient hgt events, phylogenetic approaches have more power to detect hgt and in general it is considered the most robust analysis method  <cit> .

among the plant diseases caused by fungi, anthracnose caused by members of the fungal genus colletotrichum, is one of the most destructive, causing significant crop losses worldwide . colletotrichum fungi are important as experimental models in studies of many aspects of plant disease . draft genome sequences are now available for several species of colletotrichum and are providing new insight into the study of plant-fungal interactions, , including the evolution of pathogenicity . previously, we identified a secreted protease called cpls  that was laterally transferred from plants to an ancestor of colletotrichum
 <cit> . in the present study, we surveyed the genome sequences of three members of the genus colletotrichum to identify additional evidence of hgt to determine the impact of hgt on the evolution of pathogenicity in filamentous fungi. we discuss the potential role of the candidates in pathogenicity and niche adaptation. we found that genes typically transferred by hgt are those that belong to families that are subject to constant gene duplication and loss. we also determined the age of the hgt events, by means of a time calibrated phylogeny, and discuss the timing of hgt events within the context of major geological events. this is the first time that the impact of hgt has been evaluated on a genome-wide scale in colletotrichum, and gives us insight into the evolution of this important genus.

RESULTS
identification of hgt candidates
the most robust method to detect hgt is phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . therefore, to detect putative hgt events in three colletotrichum species , we developed a pipeline that consists of a series of blast searches and automated filtering designed to reduce the number of unlikely hgt candidates, followed by manual evaluation of phylogenetic trees . since our pipeline includes several steps of manual tree inspection, we included several filters designed to reduce the number of candidates that require manual inspection and to limit them to those with the highest sequence similarity. the first blast search was performed using a database of proteins from organisms with complete proteome available in uniprot . next, we selected proteins that having at least 80% of the top  <dig> hits  with a taxonomic classification other than fungi as candidates for further analysis. the threshold of 80% was selected by evaluating previously described hgt candidates reported by richards et al.  <cit> , schmitt and lumbsch  <cit>  and richards  <cit>  . next, we subjected the hgt candidates to three phylogenetic analyses using different sets of homologous sequences in each phylogeny. the first phylogeny was constructed with homologous sequences from the uniprot complete proteome database . for the second phylogeny we performed a blast search of the genbank nr database and included the  <dig> best hits from each kingdom  to avoid a possible under or overrepresentation for the abundance of sequences from any one kingdom in the blast results. this procedure was performed to observe events of inter-kingdom hgt and to observe the place into the tree of sequences with the same taxonomic label of the query but that were not the best hits in the blast search and therefore excluded from the first analysis that uses the best  <dig> hits. the third phylogeny was constructed with the best  <dig> blast hits from the nr database. the phylogenetic trees were evaluated manually, selecting only those that have well-supported topologies that are clearly incongruent with known species relationships among the taxa. asymmetric or ladder-shape trees were excluded because such tree topologies are often a signal of long branch attraction or lack of phylogenic information  <cit> . additionally, candidates with few homologues or with low sequence similarity to all of their blast hits were also excluded. in cases where only hits from two kingdoms were obtained , high sequence similarity  and coverage  were required to consider them as candidates. the blast searches and tree evaluations were performed serially rather than in parallel to minimize the number of manual phylogenetic tree evaluations required .

during our analysis, we identified several proteins from c. gloeosporioides that appeared to be bacterial-fungal hgt events, had no homology to proteins in the other colletotrichum spp nor to any other fungus. we examined the genomic contigs encoding these proteins and determined they are generally short contigs encoding only one gene. we used megablast to search the nr database  using the contig sequences as queries. we found that the contigs align to the bacillus pumilus genome over regions ranging from  <dig> to 1615 bp and sequence similarities ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % identity . based on these blast searches, we concluded that these contigs are the result of bacterial contamination of the c. gloeosporioides genome assembly and we removed the corresponding hgt candidates from further analysis. we performed another set of blast searches to identify homologs to the hgt candidates in the three colletotrichum genomes and then arranged these additional proteins and the hgt candidates into groups of homologous sequences. one group of homologous sequences is comprised of two subtilisin-like serine proteases putatively transferred from a plant ancestor and which we previously described as cplss   <cit> . the remaining groups appear to be of bacterial origin. the result was a list of  <dig> groups of homologous sequences representing  <dig> hgt events . homologs to hgt <dig> and hgt <dig> were described as hgt candidates by sun et al.  <cit>  and marcet-houben and gabaldón  <cit>  respectively.table  <dig>

none of the  <dig> c. graminicola hgt candidates of bacterial origin have introns consistent with their prokaryotic origin. only  <dig> % of the genes encoded in the c. graminicola genome lack introns and the probability of selecting  <dig> intronless genes at random from the c. graminicola genome is  <dig> e- <dig> further supporting the hypothesis that the  <dig> candidates are of bacterial origin. to corroborate this calculate we performed a mann–whitney-wilcoxon test to determine whether the two samples of genes  are the same, with respect to the number of introns in the genes. these two set of genes were significantly different , from which we conclude that the  <dig> hgt candidates have a different intron distribution than the genome.

we considered that the hgt candidates might lack introns because they are members of gene families that typically lack introns. to test this alternative hypothesis, we first identified  <dig> homologs to the hgt candidates by searching the proteomes for proteins with the same functional annotation as the candidates. we counted the number of introns in the  <dig> homologs and compared this sample to the intron content of the rest of the genes in the genome using a mann–whitney-wilcoxon test. the  <dig> gene sample was not significantly different from the rest of the genes in the genome . thus, we conclude that the hgt candidates are not from intron-poor gene families. this evidence supports the hypothesis that the lack of introns in the hgt candidates is the consequence of their bacterial origin.

the gc content of horizontally transferred genes can be different than genes within the recipient genome  <cit> . we used the mann–whitney-wilcoxon test to determine whether there is a difference in gc content between the  <dig> hgt candidates in c. graminicola and the rest of the genes encoded in the genome. we found that the gc content of the hgt candidates is not different from the rest of the genome .

functional annotation of hgt candidates
the putative function and the biochemical pathways of the hgt candidates were deduced with brenda   <cit> , kegg   <cit> , metacyc  <dig>   <cit> , merops  <dig>   <cit>  and cazy  <cit>  and are summarized in table  <dig>  most of the candidates are involved in processes such as carbohydrate metabolism , amino acid metabolism , secondary metabolism  or are secreted degrading enzymes . all of the candidates are enzymes and except for hgt <dig>  all belong to gene families that are also present in vertically transferred genes. for example hgt <dig> is annotated as an argininosuccinate lyase , the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of fumarate and arginine from l-argininosuccinate in the urea cycle. three other genes in the c. graminicola genome share the same annotation.table  <dig>

four of the hgt candidates are involved in carbohydrate metabolism. genes in hgt <dig> encode glucarate dehydratase, the enzyme that transforms d-glucarate to 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-d-glucarate + h2o in the d-glucarate degradation reaction. genes in hgt <dig> encode 2-deoxy-d-gluconate 3-dehydrogenase, which is involved in pentose and glucuronate interconversion. additionally, hgt <dig> genes encode acetyl-coa synthetase, which is involved in glucose biosynthesis and in the biosynthesis of the fatty acids and in the krebs cycle  <cit> . finally, hgt <dig> encodes oligoxyloglucan reducing-end-specific cellobiohydrolase enzymes , which putatively breakdown carbohydrates in the plant cell wall  <cit> .

candidate hgt <dig>  is the only hgt candidate that does not have vertically transmitted homologs in the colletotrichum genomes and this may represent the acquisition of a completely new gene family by hgt. this enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of glutathionylspermidine and adp+ orthophosphate from glutathione and spermidine. this reaction is well understood in trypanosomatid parasites and e. coli and some evidence supports the role of glutathionylspermidine synthase in detoxification of redox reactions  <cit> .

at least  <dig> hgt candidates have clear associations with plant interactions and virulence. members of hgt <dig> encode secreted glycoside hydrolases belonging to cazy family gh <dig>  <cit>  which degrade cellulose in the plant cell wall and are important for virulence in magnaporthe oryzae and other fungi  <cit> . members of hgt <dig>  encoding a short chain dehydrogenase, have significant similarity to virulence factors in the bacterial virulence factors database  and the phi-base v <dig>  database of proteins with roles in pathogen/host interactions. a homolog of this protein in cochliobolous heterostrophus, oxi <dig>  is required for biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite t-toxin  <cit>  and null mutants of the gene show reduced virulence. members of hgt <dig> have strong similarity to sidi from aspergillus fumigatus which plays a role in siderophore biosynthesis and subsequently, virulence  <cit> . finally hgt <dig>  a family of arginosuccinate lyase genes, share homology with arg <dig> of fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis
 <cit> . null mutants in f. oxysporum have reduced virulence, linking virulence with arginine biosynthesis.

many of the hgt candidates belong to functional categories that are described as enriched in ‘volatile’ genes by wapinsky et al.  <cit> . volatile genes are those that evolve by duplication and loss in contrast to uniform  and persistent  genes. only hgt <dig> coincides with a category enriched in persistent genes  .table  <dig>

hgt candidates are expressed during plant infection
we reasoned that if the hgt candidates have roles in virulence then they should be expressed during infection of the host. therefore, we used the transcriptome profiling experiments reported by o’connell et al.  <cit>  to identify differences in the level of expression of the hgt gene candidates from c. graminicola and c. higginsianum during three stages of infection of their respective hosts, maize and arabidopsis. we also examined the expression of a selection of vertically transmitted homologs to the hgt candidates during the infection process. the transcriptional profiling experiment was conducted at three important time points during the infection process: early , middle  and late . candidates glrg_ <dig>  and glrg_ <dig>  of c. graminicola and candidates ch063_ <dig> , ch063_ <dig>  and ch063_ <dig>  of c. higginsianum are strongly upregulated at the pa and bp time points which are very early in the infection process, suggesting a role in plant penetration or establishment of infection . the candidates glrg_ <dig> , glrg_ <dig> , ch063_ <dig> , ch063_ <dig>  and ch063_ <dig>  are upregulated at the latest stage of infection suggesting roles in nutrient uptake.

a steady tempo of hgt events in the pezizomycotina
we hypothesized that hgt enables fungi to adopt new ecological niches by giving them access to new nutritional substrates or enabling pathogens or endophytes to jump to new hosts. if this is true then hgt might be more common after major extinction events that may open new niches for colonization by new species. to deduce the age of the hgt events, we reconstructed a species tree with all of the fungal species observed in the hgt detection pipeline. all of the hgt events occurred after the appearance of the pezizomycotina  and all but three  occurred after the appearance of the sordariomycetes. we calculated the approximate divergence times of the lineages using a bayesian time-measured phylogeny using the fossil paleopyrenomycites devonicus to calibrate the tree  <cit>  . we estimated the minimum ages of transference from bacteria to ancestral members of the pezizomycotina based on the lower bound of the highest posterior density  interval. the hgt events occurred over a broad range of geological periods . in contrast to our expectations, there is no evidence of a burst of hgt events coinciding with major geological events. in contrast, hgt appears to be a constant, albeit rare phenomenon in the pezizomycotina, occurring with a steady tempo during their evolution.

while many of the hgt events are ancient, none of them are broadly distributed in extant species of the pezizomycotina , therefore, many lineages of fungi must have lost the genes. if hgt is associated with niche adaptation then we may find that fungi with certain lifestyles have maintained horizontally transferred genes that are required for the lifestyle.figure  <dig>

from figure  <dig> we can also estimate the number of gene losses that occurred following the hgt events, based on the absence of orthologs to the hgt candidates in the whole genome sequences that are available in genbank. we identified the species with presence/absence of each of eleven groups of candidates .  <dig> % of pezizomycotina species  had lost all members of hgt <dig>   <dig> % of species had lost all the members of hgt <dig> and  <dig> % of species had lost all members of hgt <dig>  in contrast, hgt <dig>  hgt <dig>  hgt <dig>  hgt <dig> and hgt <dig> are always present in species of the genus colletotrichum. the lifestyle information for each species used in the tree reconstruction was compiled in additional file 1: table s <dig>  this information was used to determine if there is a correlation between the lifestyle of the pezizomycotina species and the presence/absence of the hgt candidates. we did not observe a direct relationship between the lifestyle and the presence of hgt candidates except in hgt <dig> and hgt <dig>  which are exclusively found in pathogenic species including the entomopathogens cordyceps militaris and beauveria bassiana .

discussion
in this study, we developed a semi-automated pipeline to identify hgt candidates in fungal genomes and applied it to three species of the genus colletotrichum. the construction and analysis of phylogenetic trees is recognized as the most reliable method for detecting hgt, so we included several steps of manual phylogenetic trees inspection in the pipeline. using this pipeline, we detected  <dig> genes with evidence of hgt from bacteria and one from plants to the genus colletotrichum. the genes were classified into  <dig> families of homologous sequences  representing  <dig> hgt events. since our pipeline excludes more distantly related proteins, the hgt events that were identified in this work are only those that yield well-supported phylogenetic trees that pass strict topology tests.

none of the genes of bacterial origin have introns, which is statistically unlikely and consistent with their prokaryotic origin. this observation is consistent with those of other authors who have also reported that horizontally transferred genes from bacteria lack typically introns  <cit> .

many of the hgt candidates are involved in metabolic processes such as synthesis of amino acids , lipid metabolism , sugar metabolism  and secondary metabolism . hgt <dig> belongs to a family of argininosuccinate lyase genes responsible for the formation of arginine and fumarate in the urea cycle. in c. graminicola, hgt <dig> member glrg_ <dig> as well as the three other arginosuccinate lyase genes in this species are expressed in all stages of the infection process . in contrast, the c. higginsianum hgt <dig> member ch063_ <dig> is upregulated only late in the infection process. a previous study by takahara et al.  <cit>  found that arginine biosynthesis in c. higginsianum is essential for the early stages of plant infection but the upregulation of ch063_ <dig> in the last stage of infection  suggests a different role in this pathogen. in another study, a mutant of arg <dig>  an arginosuccinate lyase encoding gene in fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis showed reduced virulence  <cit> . these studies point to an important role of arginine synthesis during the infection process and suggest that the acquisition of an arginosuccinate lyase by hgt may have improved fitness of an ancestral fungal species by increasing virulence.

other enzymes with roles amino acids metabolism are the members of hgt <dig>  a family of l-asparaginases in the aspartic acid synthesis pathway and hgt <dig> a family of succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase enzymes in the lysine biosynthesis pathway. hgt <dig> was found only in the genus colletotrichum and hgt <dig> is found in colletotrichum as well as the closely related genus verticillium. in bacteria, the horizontal transfer of amino acid metabolic genes have been proposed to provide metabolic plasticity to the recipient species of both non pathogenic  <cit>  and pathogenic  <cit>  species, enabling them to exploit new nutritional sources. this hypothesis has also been proposed for fungal hgt genes  <cit> .

many of the hgt candidates have functions related to sugar and lipid metabolism , consistent previous reports  <cit> . richards et al.  <cit>  propose that the hgt of genes in these functional categories can increase the osmotrophic capacity of fungi. all fungi are osmotrophs, yet horizontally transferred genes are frequently lost in many lineages indicating that there was a subsequent loss of selective pressure to maintain the gene after its initial acquisition. we suggest that hgt is important in niche adaptation and that during the evolution of the fungi, changes in a species’ niche have lead to changes in the selective pressure on the genes required for nutrient uptake.

the putative functions of genes in hgt <dig> and hgt <dig> in the degradation of cell wall sugars  and proteins  and the presence of a predicted secretion signal peptide opens the possibility that they may be secreted lytic enzymes. the time of overexpression of glrg_ <dig>  in c. graminicola  coincides with the necrotrophic phase suggesting that this protein has a bigger role in nutrient acquisition rather than in host penetration. this is also the case with ch063_ <dig>  in c. higginsianum which is also overexpressed in the necrotrophic phase. a similar scenario was described by o’ connell et al.  <cit>  in the transcriptomic analysis of c. graminicola and c. higginsianum. the authors observed a vast array of lytic enzymes induced at the transition to necrotrophy, the stage at which the pathogen uses dead and dying host cells as a nutrient source to support rapid colonization and sporulation. in contrast, glrg_ <dig>  of c. graminicola does not have changes in expression levels during the infection process, suggesting that its role during infection may be different from that of its c. higginsianum counterpart.

the hgt events hgt <dig> and hgt <dig> are among the most ancient, having occurred at least  <dig> million years ago. the transferred genes have been retained in only a few species, all of which are pathogenic, and in the case of hgt <dig>  includes the entomopathogens cordyceps militaris and beauveria bassiana. this suggests that these genes have an important function in host-fungal interactions and that it has maintained this function for millions of years.

a large number of the hgt candidates have functions related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. in the ascomycetes, gene families with these functions were associated with “volatility”, a term introduced by wapinsky et al.  <cit>  to describe genes that evolve by duplication and loss in contrast to uniform  and persistent  genes. volatile genes have the ability to evolve by losing or gaining copies without drastic selective consequences, providing new functions or pruning old ones. the functional categories of the hgt candidates reported in the meta analysis of richards et al.  <cit>  are also rich in volatile functional categories such as carbohydrate metabolism suggesting that hgt is much more likely if the gene is a member of a volatile family.

we also developed a time calibrated phylogenetic tree and deduced the ages of the hgt events . it is important to note that the phylogeny was calibrated with a single fossil and as such, the phylogeny can provide only rough estimates of the dates of the hgt events. nevertheless, the phylogeny enables us to, for the first time, consider hgt within the context of geologic time. the deduced dates for the hgt events reflect the antiquity of the hgt events reported in this study. except for hgt <dig> the transference of all the candidates was situated between  <dig>  million years ago  and  <dig>  mya . that reflects very ancient hgt events and despite the high rate of losses in the pezizomycotina these proteins probably were useful in the adaptation of the organisms to their niches. from the distribution of transfer events in time we can deduce that the hgt occurred all throughout the evolution of pezizomycotina. also, given the high percentage of gene losses among the laterally transferred genes we suggest that the number of hgt events detected in the present study represents only a small fraction of the transferences that occurred in the past.

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic evidence presented in this work shows that the genetic flux from bacteria to pezizomycotina have been constant. most of the pezizomycotina with complete genomes available have no evidence of homologs to the colletotrichum hgt candidates, reflecting the propensity of gene loss in horizontally transferred genes. the molecular clock analysis reveals that the hgt events detected in the present have an ancient origin. the hgt candidates typically belong to volatile gene families that are subject to frequent gene duplication and loss. nevertheless, it is possible that the horizontally transferred gene provided new functions that were useful to ancestral fungi, enabling them to colonize new niches or improve fitness. with the evidence in this work and in other studies, we propose that hgt has been an important evolutionary force in the pezizomycotina.
