BACKGROUND
sorghum  is the fifth most important grain crop after maize, wheat, rice, and barley  <cit> . its role as source of grain and cellulosic-based ethanol is of growing importance. the region of domestication and diversity is located in northeast africa, an area that extends from ethiopia to sudan  <cit> , but the crop is now grown in an array of environments, ranging from tropical to temperate regions. sorghum is a highly diverse crop that has experienced multiple re-domestication processes, resulting in five major races differentiated by inflorescence type  <cit> . these races are associated with particular environments  <cit> , and ongoing evolution in these regions by recombination and selection has led to a highly diverse crop.

ex situ sorghum germplasm collections  have been established in several countries as a resource for breeding programs. these germplasm collections provide genetic variation for crop improvement programs. today, the largest worldwide sorghum collection is maintained by the usda agriculture research service national plant germplasm system  and includes > <dig>  accessions from  <dig> countries. likewise, the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics , located in india, has a sorghum collection of  <dig>  accessions from different countries. the national genebank of china maintains a sorghum collection of over  <dig>  accessions, including  <dig>  chinese sorghum landraces. to use these resources, breeding programs must have an understanding of the variation within the germplasm collection  <cit> . the establishment of core reference sets  that represent the genetic diversity of the broader collection provides a mechanism to classify these resources for the scientific community. in this regard, icrisat has developed a core collection of  <dig>  accessions based on phenotypic information  <cit> ; this collection was later reduced to a mini-core of  <dig> accessions based on genetic profiles  <cit> . a core collection of  <dig>  accessions was established for the npgs sorghum collection using origin site information .

the selection of landraces for inclusion in a core set based on passport information alone may not adequately represent the genetic diversity owing to limited passport information for many accessions and/or genetic redundancy . therefore, the use of a molecular genetics approach is imperative for the conservation and utilization of the collection. however, molecular genetic approaches have been limited to specific samples of sorghum from the npgs , and a large portion of the genetic diversity remains uncharacterized in the germplasm collection. these studies confirm that modern sorghum breeding materials are from a narrow genetic base, despite high genetic diversity in the germplasm collection. recently, a sorghum association panel  comprising  <dig> u.s. breeding lines and their  <dig> progenitor accessions was assembled with the purpose of genetically dissecting economically important traits  <cit> . certainly, this panel encompasses a wide range of sorghum genetic diversity that has been exploited in breeding programs, but it is not representative of the vast genetic diversity present in the npgs collection. further genomic characterization of a broader range of sorghum diversity is required to both improve conservation efforts and provide new knowledge to promote its integration into sorghum breeding programs.

genome sequence information and next-generation sequencing technology have made important contributions to the development of new genotyping platforms. today, genotyping-by-sequencing   <cit>  is arguably the most widely used method to genetically characterize plant germplasm. the large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  identified by gbs makes it possible to integrate into a single research project analyses of genetic diversity and genome-wide association studies   <cit> , and is invaluable for the identification of allelic diversity and rare genetic variation as well as functional analyses. in maize, an analysis of  <dig>  inbred accessions from npgs resulted in the identification of  <dig>  snp markers, half of which were classified as rare variants   <cit> . likewise, in sorghum, an analysis of  <dig> worldwide sorghum accessions  resulted in the identification of ~ <dig>  snp markers  <cit> , and an analysis of  <dig>  georeferenced sorghum landraces  was used to identify  <dig>  snp markers  <cit> . these sorghum genetic diversity studies have substantially improved our understanding of the genetic basis of the domestication process as well as the adaptation of various sorghum races within particular environments. moreover, they substantiate the use of genotypic and environmental information to predict the phenotypes of accessions. hence, the phenotypes of accessions within large germplasm collections could be predicted based on prior genotypic and phenotypic analyses of a core subset of accessions.

the ethiopian germplasm maintained by npgs contains  <dig>  accessions, representing 17% of the sorghum collection  <cit> . unfortunately, the geographic coordinates of the collection sites are unknown for 83% of these accessions, limiting the establishment of a representative subset based on passport information alone. an analysis of  <dig> randomly selected ethiopian accessions with  <dig> simple sequence repeat markers revealed abundant genetic diversity divided into two main subpopulations  <cit> . four of the five sorghum races and wild forms are present in ethiopia  <cit> , and previous phenotypic and genotypic analyses identified high levels of genetic diversity in this germplasm  <cit> . in addition, the geographic distribution of morphological characteristics appears to be determined by topography and climatic variation  <cit> . recently, some ethiopian accessions from the npgs were genetically characterized for use in gwas , but the limited number of accessions and/or the selection approach  may bias estimates of the actual genetic diversity in the collection because these samples were not established to represent the ethiopian collection. in the current study, we established a core subset of  <dig> npgs ethiopian accessions based on the actual frequency distribution of the known sorghum races in this collection. we phenotyped these accessions for several important agronomic traits at two locations and used gbs to 1) evaluate their genetic and phenotype diversity, 2) determine population structure, 3) study the genetic relationships among accessions , 4) determine the genetic relationship between the ethiopia npgs collection and the sap, and 5) explore the potential of this germplasm to elucidate the genetic architecture of quantitative traits using gwas.

RESULTS
gbs of npgs ethiopian germplasm
the ethiopian germplasm core set examined in this experiment comprised  <dig> exotic accessions and  <dig> converted tropical lines that are photoperiod-insensitive and dwarf and were produced by crossing exotic lines and modern us cultivars. this core set represented ~5% of the ethiopian collection, including  <dig> sorghum races, of which durra, durra-bicolor, and unclassified accessions represented 72% of the accessions . we pooled tissue from three seedlings for dna extraction and analyzed the data as a single gbs sample. we obtained approximately 5×sequencing coverage per accession, resulting in the identification of  <dig>  snps with an average of 34% missing data. we retained snps with <20% missing data and minor allele frequencies of > <dig>   to obtain a final sample of  <dig>  snps for further analyses. these snps were distributed along the ten sorghum chromosomes with an average of  <dig> snp per  <dig>  kb; the majority of snps were located in sub-telomeric gene-rich regions. in fact, these snps tagged  <dig>  annotated genes, while another  <dig>  genes were within  <dig> kbp upstream or downstream of a snp.table  <dig> distribution of sorghum races present in the ethiopian collection from npgs

integrity of npgs ethiopian collection
the preservation and effective use of the npgs ethiopian collection require an adequate knowledge of its genetic diversity to avoid genetic drift and phenotyping duplicate accessions. the majority of these accessions were collected more than 70 years ago and represent multiple independent germplasm collections; likewise, the seed increase process for this enormous collection  may contribute to problems, such as material duplication by labeling and logistic errors. we calculated the identity-by-state  genetic distance among all pairs of accessions using  <dig>  unlinked snps  that were evenly distributed across the sorghum genome. remarkably, of the  <dig>  pairwise ibs genetic distances, only  <dig> exceeded  <dig>  , and these represented five groups of  <dig> closely related accessions. indeed, no genetic profile was duplicated and the average ibs among accessions was  <dig> . the homogeneity of each accession is essential for phenotyping analyses. in the gbs analysis, we detected high levels of inbreeding within accessions; the average heterozygosity  was not larger than the observed heterozygosity in previous studies of sorghum landraces  <cit> . even though this study was based on 5% of the npgs ethiopian collection, the results indicate that its assembly and maintain has been adequate capturing and preserving its genetic diversity.fig.  <dig> distribution of identity by state  genetic distances amongst  <dig> npgs ethiopian accessions determined by the analysis of  <dig>  unlinked  single nucleotides polymorphism




population structure
understanding the population structure of the npgs ethiopian collection is imperative to establish new strategies to preserve and utilize its genetic diversity and is a prerequisite for gwas. we inferred that there are  <dig> ancestral populations based on 10-fold cross-validation using admixture  <cit>  . in total, we assigned  <dig> accessions  to one of these populations with an ancestry membership coefficient of greater than  <dig> , and we categorized the remaining 47% as having evidence of admixture . indeed, the pairwise fixation index  among these populations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating a relatively high level of genetic differentiation . we determined the effective population size  based on the linkage disequilibrium  of  <dig>  snps with maf >  <dig> . we obtained an ne of  <dig> individuals, which was comparable to the total number of accessions with an ancestry membership coefficient of greater than  <dig> . in fact, these  <dig> accessions covered 90% of the observed allelic diversity ; accordingly, additional phenotyping could be limited to or initiated with these accessions. the conservation of these particular accessions is imperative to maintain the genetic diversity of this core set of the collection.fig.  <dig> population structure analysis of  <dig> npgs ethiopian sorghum accessions. a the optimal number of subpopulations was  <dig> based on the admixture analysis with the cross validation for k values from  <dig> to  <dig> using  <dig>  unlinked  snps distributed across the genome. b hierarchical organization of genetic relatedness of the  <dig> ethiopian accessions, each individual bar represents an accession





we used an unrooted neighbor-joining tree to determine the genetic relationships among these populations. the results of this analysis were consistent with the previously determined population structure , with  <dig> populations belonging to four main clades. the largest clade included populations  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  suggesting high genetic relatedness among these populations. additionally, populations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> formed a group. the majority of the accessions from populations  <dig> and  <dig> belonged to one common clade, while population  <dig> belonged to a group with three accessions from population  <dig>  we observed accessions with evidence of admixture throughout the tree, although we detected one large cluster that included one accession from population  <dig>  the genetic relationships among populations provide insight into the history of the observed population structure. we inferred that four founder populations may have subsequently subdivided into  <dig> populations. we did not detect concordance between our phylogenetic and population structure results and the  <dig> sorghum races present in the ethiopian germplasm collection. durra and the intermediate durra-bicolor are the most frequent races, and their domestication is associated with the ethiopian region  <cit> . accessions classified as these two races were dispersed among the  <dig> populations, indicating that the observed population structure was most likely the result of adaptation to different ethiopian environments. the selection of accessions for phenotype evaluations based on this population structure analysis ensures the presence of the majority of the genetic diversity present in the npgs ethiopian germplasm collection.fig.  <dig> neighbor joining tree of the  <dig> ethiopian accessions where admixture accessions are not colored




allelic diversity
based on the allele frequency distribution for this npgs ethiopia collection core, 60% of the snps were rare  . a high frequency of rare alleles was also observed in a gbs analysis of  <dig>  maize inbred accessions from the npgs collection  <cit> , confirming the high accuracy of rare allele detection using gbs. in fact, we detected all of these rare alleles in at least three accessions . we found that the  <dig> representative accessions  had a similar proportion of rare alleles. in the four largest populations , which included more than  <dig> accessions, we found that an average of 55% of alleles were rare. for populations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which included  <dig> to  <dig> accessions, an average of 29% of alleles were rare. since populations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had fewer than ten accessions, we did not estimate the proportion of rare alleles. the large number of admixture accessions in the collection and the distribution of rare alleles among populations suggest these rare alleles could represent recent introgression from neighboring countries. to compare the diversity between these  <dig> populations, we determined the total number of private alleles in each population. we identified  <dig>  private alleles that characterized these  <dig> populations. populations  <dig> and  <dig> had the most private alleles  and these two populations  had 66% of the total allelic diversity . populations six and nine had  <dig>  and  <dig>  private alleles, respectively, and had 68% of the total allelic diversity  with a total of  <dig> accessions. in the  <dig> accessions with evidence of admixture, we only detected  <dig>  private alleles. the npgs ethiopian collection could be arranged into these  <dig> groups  using a high-throughput genotyping platform based on these private alleles. the organization of this germplasm collection can improve conservation efforts and phenotypic analyses. for instance, the selection of particular populations and/or subsets of accessions that capture the majority of the allelic diversity will optimize the use of phenotyping resources. allelic richness could be monitored as an indicator of the conservation status of its genetic diversity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> allele frequency distribution of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms among  <dig> npgs ethiopian accessions




how much of the genetic diversity present in npgs ethiopian germplasm has been used in us breeding programs? the us sap encompasses a wide range of sorghum germplasm that has been exploited in breeding programs and was recently genetically characterized  <cit> . we identified all of the common alleles between sap and this ethiopian core set. we detected  <dig>  common alleles, of which 74% had a maf of greater than  <dig> . in fact, 20%  of the rare alleles in the ethiopia core set were present in sap, while 57%  had a maf of greater than  <dig> . in total, 59% of the  <dig>  private alleles that characterize the  <dig> ethiopian populations were present in sap. however, only the private alleles from populations  <dig> and  <dig> were adequately represented in sap . in fact, the neighbor-joining cluster analysis of sap and the  <dig> ethiopian populations based on  <dig>  unlinked snps showed that populations  <dig> and  <dig> are completely integrated in sap , suggesting these two populations have been used extensively in breeding programs. the other nine ethiopian populations expanded the genetic diversity of sap accessions originally from ethiopia and india. hence, the npgs ethiopian collection is a germplasm resource that could be used to support and increase the genetic diversity in sap. the integration of particular ethiopian accessions from populations  <dig> to  <dig> into sap will be useful for the discovery of new agronomically important alleles and to advance the use of this germplasm collection.fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining tree of the  <dig> representative npgs ethiopian accessions and  <dig> lines from the u.s. sorghum association panel  based on  <dig>  unlinked  snps. colored labels represent the  <dig> populations present in npgs ethiopian germplasm




genetic diversity and signatures of selection
the management of germplasm collections is intended to maintain the maximum possible genetic diversity of the crop. we measured the levels of genetic diversity and divergence among populations in the npgs ethiopia collection based on ld  and f
st across the genome. in the ethiopia collection, we observed an average r
 <dig> of ≤ <dig>  at distances of greater than 6 kb . this decay in ld was more rapid than the decay observed in previous analyses of  <dig> landraces from different african countries and the sap, in which ld extended from  <dig> to 50 kb  <cit> . the rapid decay in ld among ethiopian accessions could be explained by the early establishment of these populations after the domestication of sorghum. moreover, many accessions had evidence of admixture, which reduces the average length of ld blocks, reflecting a mixture of ancient and new ethiopian landraces. certainly, the high number of recombination events is associated with the phenotype diversity of this germplasm, and can be useful for the genomic dissection of agronomically important traits by gwas; however, deep sequencing coverage may be required to cover all genomic blocks.

the population structure of a plant is determined by abiotic and biotic factors that influence selection  <cit> . the high genetic differentiation index  between these  <dig> ethiopian populations  indicates selection in particular environmental conditions. the identification of traits that define each of these populations is imperative to improve the use of this germplasm; agronomic traits that are at high frequencies within a particular population can be screened. in this regard, the genetics underlying the observed population structure may reveal genomic regions that are involved in the selection of particular traits. to identify genomic regions that may be under selection pressure, we used the f
st outlier method implemented in bayescan v. <dig>   <cit> . this approach distinguishes between loci that diverged via random drift and those that diverged via selection. we detected  <dig> snps that diverged by selection, of which  <dig> snps were consistent with diversifying selection and  <dig> snps were consistent with balancing selection . we observed these signatures of selection across the whole genome, but particularly in sub-telomeric gene-rich regions. we detected diversifying selection on tannin <dig>  <cit>  . tannins have diverse biological functions, including protection against pathogenic bacteria and fungi and predation by herbivorous animals  <cit> . we detected additional f
st outlier snps with a broad range of gene ontology annotations, including metabolic process , signal transduction , dna damage repair, and retrotransposon proteins. natural selection contributes more substantially to the structure of ethiopian sorghum populations than selection by farmers.fig.  <dig> bayescan result for the analysis of  <dig>  unlinked snps distributed among  <dig> ethiopian sorghum populations for outlier prediction. a the distribution of snps across the sorghum genome. red dots represents fst outliers. b bayescan analysis for outlier prediction with a false discovery rate  of p <  <dig>  




phenotypic diversity
the npgs ethiopian germplasm collection is the largest group of accessions in the sorghum collection; it includes  <dig> populations based on a genetic analysis. the phenotypic characterization of these populations is necessary to deeply understand the population structure and improve the use of the collection. we characterized these populations with respect to agronomic traits that might be associated with ecogeographical variation and the agricultural system of ethiopia as well as other traits of potential interest to the sorghum breeding community.

the phenotypic diversity of ethiopian germplasm was associated with the observed population structure. in fact, among the  <dig> ethiopian populations, we observed differences in  <dig> evaluated traits, with an average of six groups per trait . these results confirmed the observed diversifying selection in the genetic analysis since contrasting phenotypes characterize these populations . in fact, each population had a unique phenotypic profile, suggesting that they represent different environmental conditions affecting selection. for instance, in population  <dig>  we observed evidence of selection for high biomass and small seed size, and we observed higher levels of tannins contentin population  <dig>  certainly, the population structure could reflect agro-environmental regions in ethiopia and/or agronomically important traits, and could be used to establish better strategies to select accessions for phenotype screening.table  <dig> phenotypic traits for the  <dig> npgs ethiopian subpopulations

to improve our understanding of the selection process underlying the observed population structure, we used a principal component analysis  to identify the relative importance of these traits in shaping phenotype diversity. the first four principal components accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the total phenotype diversity, and seed compositional traits had the largest loading coefficients . in fact, phenol, protein, tannin, and 3-doa contents had highly similar degrees and directions for pc <dig> loading. the high diversity of these four seed compositional traits may be explained by opposing selection pressures driven by humans and natural conditions. for instance, high levels of tannins and phenols are associated with grain mold resistance, but these two compounds are unacceptable in seeds for human consumption  <cit> . agronomical traits, such as plant height , panicle length and diameter , and flowering, showed positive loading values for pc <dig>  while the dhurrin content  had loading effects in pc <dig>  these results indicate that seed compositional traits define ethiopian sorghum cultivars, while agronomical traits have a secondary role owing to the undeveloped agricultural system in the country. hence, the germplasm includes valuable alleles for seed compositional traits for sorghum breeding programs. in fact, the high genetic and phenotypic diversity within the ethiopian germplasm is the result of a balance between both artificial and natural selection in each population.table  <dig> principal component analysis of  <dig> phenotype traits evaluated in  <dig> accessions from npgs ethiopian germplasm collection

gwas studies
the ethiopian npgs germplasm collection is a highly genetically and phenotypically diverse public germplasm with important applications for the improvement of sorghum breeding programs. despite the large size of this collection, the use of molecular markers associated with important agronomic traits could facilitate the identification of valuable accessions. therefore, we explored the potential use of these low-coverage data and the population structure analysis for gwas. we analyzed seed tannin content and ph, two extensively studied traits  <cit> . the snp with the strongest association with tannin content  was the same as the one found in an analysis using the sap  <cit>  and explained  <dig> % of the genetic variance. this snp was not in complete ld with the tan <dig> null allele  <cit> , as observed in the sap  <cit> . additionally,  <dig> converted dwarf tropical lines in the panel were used to detect dwarfing genes on chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ; these loci were introgressed during the conversion of these lines  <cit>  and explained 27% of the genetic variance. based on q–q plots, both traits demonstrated associations when controlling for population structure and genetic relatedness using a compressed mixed linear model, decreasing the identification of spurious associations .

to identify novel loci in exotic germplasm, we analyzed ph and flowering time  without including the  <dig> converted dwarf tropical lines. we detected a significant association between ph and the distal region of chromosome  <dig> . this loci explained  <dig> % of the genetic variance while the genetic relatedness among accessions  accounted for  <dig> % of the genetic variance indicating that a large portion of the variation is still uncharacterized. although we did not identify a candidate gene in the region or overlap with a previously detected qtl, the region deserves further study. we did not detect a significant association for fl using the whole subset or the subset lacking the converted lines. in an analysis of other agronomical traits , we did not identify significant associations. indeed, in gwas for some of these traits using the sap, significant associations have not been detected  <cit> . the low heritability and phenotype variation for some of these traits, limited number of accessions, low-coverage data, and complexity of the traits could affect the detection of significant associations.fig.  <dig> gwas for plant height using a subset of  <dig> ethiopian accessions from npgs germplasm collection




based on a gwas of seed compositional traits, we identified novel loci for protein and fat content, and confirmed a previous result for total phenol content. we obtained similar results for total phenol and tannin contents; snp s4_ <dig> demonstrated the most significant association for these traits . a significant correlation between these two traits was also observed in the sap, in which total phenol content was associated with tannin <dig>  <cit> . a genomic region in chromosome  <dig> was associated with fat and protein content . even though we detected a significant correlation between the fat and protein contents , we identified two loci in the gwas that were  <dig> kbp apart . in fact, we detected the strongest associations for fat and protein content with the snps s2_ <dig>  and s2_ <dig> , respectively, which explained  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the genetic variance, respectively. since the genetic relatedness among accessions only accounted for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the genetic variance other important loci are still unidentified. these snps were located within the genes sb02g <dig>   and sb02g <dig>  , which have not been associated with particular phenotypes in sorghum or arabidopsis. additional phenotype and genotype analyses are required to verify these associations. this ethiopian core set and its genetic characterization could provide a basis for the discovery of important loci in this exotic germplasm.fig.  <dig> gwas for seed protein and fat content using a subset of  <dig> ethiopian sorghum accessions from the npgs germplasm collection. a gwas for protein content, b gwas for fat content, c chromosome  <dig> region associated with fat and protein




discussion
at present, only a minor portion of the genetic diversity in the npgs ethiopian collection is used in sorghum breeding programs. the large size of this particular collection and the lack of genetic and phenotypic data have contributed to the limited use of this germplasm. therefore, the genomic characterization presented herein should encourage and facilitate its use by breeders and geneticists worldwide. the combination of this genomic information with large-scale phenotyping efforts could be used to mine novel alleles for the improvement of agronomic traits. the development of new cultivars with novel alleles from ethiopian collections is a promising strategy to translate this genetic diversity into agriculture benefits.

untapping the genetic variation in the npgs ethiopian germplasm for sorghum improvement is challenging and requires precise strategies. historically, the integration of tropical exotic germplasm into sorghum breeding programs has relied on the use of adapted exotic germplasm  for temperate grain production regions via the introgression of dwarfing and early maturity genes  <cit> . today, more than  <dig>  exotic sorghum lines are adapted to temperate regions, of which approximately 20% originated in ethiopia  <cit> . nevertheless, the rapid fixation of temperate-adapted alleles in early backcross generations reduces genetic variation in multiple genomic regions; in fact, the genetic variation in chromosome  <dig> is minimal within converted sorghum germplasm  <cit> . therefore, breeding schemes that increase recombination in early generations could be used to develop temperate-adapted germplasm. in this regard, a multi-parent advanced generation intercross design  <cit>  or the employment of various cycles of recurrent genotypic selection should be adequate to exploit the genetic diversity of ethiopian germplasm. for instance, an initial phenotypic evaluation  may be completed to identify superior and genetically diverse ethiopian accessions in the core set and these accessions may be crossed with a temperate-adapted germplasm. the progeny can be systematically intercrossed and/or selfed in tropical regions during early generations and genotyped to maintain temperate-adapted alleles . superior families can be evaluated in temperate regions for traits of interest and to fix the temperate-adapted alleles. indeed, previous phenotypic analyses of these types of populations in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and wheat  <cit>  identified transgressive segregation, which is valuable for breeding.

today, the sap is widely used for the genomic dissection of multiple agronomically important traits  <cit> . this diversity panel, which includes worldwide sorghum accessions, captures a large portion of sorghum genetic diversity. however, the limited number of ethiopian accessions  does not adequately represent the genetic diversity in the npgs ethiopia germplasm collection . moreover, these accessions have lower genetic diversity than the original exotic germplasm, since they are temperate-adapted lines developed by the introgression of common genomic regions associated with photoperiod sensitivity and dwarfing  <cit> . the expanded use of the npgs collection requires a size reduction to expedite the screening process. our genomic characterization clearly indicated that the npgs ethiopian germplasm collection could be reduced by 50% while maintaining more than 90% of the total genetic diversity. certainly, a continuous reduction in gbs data makes it possible to generate snp data on the whole collection at lower coverage  to establish a precise core set.

germplasm conservation is imperative for continual agricultural improvements. studies of the genetic relatedness among all ex situ accessions in germplasm collections and genetic redundancy should improve conservation efforts and practical applications. gbs is rapidly becoming the standard choice for genetic studies and germplasm characterization. hence, in the near future, multiple independent gbs analyses of sorghum accessions from different germplasm collections will likely be integrated into a meta-analysis to identify duplicates and closely related accessions among worldwide germplasm collections. in this regard, a multi-institutional effort is necessary to systematically explore the genetic diversity of all ex situ sorghum collections to broaden the genetic base of breeding programs worldwide. indeed, the preservation of redundant germplasm in ex situ collections is a waste of limited resources  <cit>  and does not promote the goal of improving the germplasm.

CONCLUSIONS
the npgs ethiopian sorghum germplasm is a highly genetically and phenotypically diverse germplasm collection comprising  <dig> populations. the genetic diversity of the germplasm is largely unused in sorghum breeding programs. our results provide sorghum breeders and geneticists worldwide with knowledge and tools to utilize and conserve this germplasm. in fact, these results will facilitate resource optimization by improving experimental designs based on population structure and genetic diversity. moreover, this genomic characterization is the first step toward the development of a npgs sorghum core collection based on genetic profiles.
