BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen capable of a wide spectrum of etiologies ranging from benign colonization of epithelia to fatal cases of septicemia. s. aureus has been identified as a global risk with the emergence of multi-drug resistant  strains. the majority of staphylococcal infections are nosocomial or community-acquired, and for both types, there is a strong correlation between staphylococcal infection and its colonization of the human nasal epithelium. asymptomatic carriage of s. aureus in the anterior nasal vestibule occurs in approximately a quarter of the population to different degrees of severity  <cit> , and can be either temporary or persist over many years. nasal carriage of s. aureus has been identified as a risk factor in the clinical treatment of diabetic foot ulcers  <cit> , post-operative recovery from heart surgery  <cit> , and hemodialysis  <cit>  amongst others.

nasal carriage of s. aureus is multifactorial and likely involves both host and bacterial determinants  <cit> . one primary determinant of nasal carriage is the permissibility of host nasal fluid for bacterial growth. indeed, a single strain of s. aureus  was shown to differentially colonize various hosts, underscoring the importance of host factors in nasal carriage  <cit> . apart from host factors, several studies, including ours  <cit>  and others  <cit> , attribute a role for bacterial factors in carriage. it is notable that carrier strains, but not non-carrier strains, of s. aureus were able to persist and replicate within nasal fluids from carrier donors and on the surface of organotypic nasal epithelia  <cit> , suggesting that carrier strains of s. aureus elaborate factors to aid in their nasal colonization.

our group has extensively characterized two strains of s. aureus, one a clinical nasal carriage strain isolated from a persistent carrier   <cit>  and another was isolated from a burn victim   <cit> . of these two strains, d <dig> was able to survive in the nasal fluid extracted from carrier host  <cit> . it was also shown to produce a capsular covering upon incubation with nasal fluid  <cit> , which is likely a protective biofilm  <cit> . contrarily, the strain 930918- <dig> was not capable of surviving in the nasal fluid of carriers and did not produce biofilms  <cit> . most importantly, we revealed that d <dig> suppressed the innate immune response by downregulating tlr expression and tlr-mediated signaling in primary nasal epithelial cells while 930918- <dig> did not  <cit> .

several bacterial genes have been identified, which can potentially influence colonization on nasal epithelia. notable amongst them are sortase a   <cit> , clumping factor b   <cit>  and tagx  <cit> , which are involved in cell adhesion  and cell wall biosynthesis , respectively. in addition, studies implicating enterotoxins in s. aureus nasal carriage  <cit>  show that enterotoxins were found in most but not all carrier strains. however, as we reveal herein, these collective genes may be necessary but not sufficient factors for nasal carriage. taken together, these reports suggest that nasal carriage is a multifactorial process, although our knowledge of bacterial factors responsible for nasal carriage of s. aureus is still quite limited.

in this work, we have strived to bridge the genome level knowledge gap that exists in s. aureus nasal carriage. first, we assessed the lineage specific differences between carrier strains and non-carrier strains using multi-locus sequence typing   <cit> . subsequently, in order to determine the genome level differences between the model carrier strain and non carrier strain, we undertook a complete genome sequencing effort for our two highly characterized strains, d <dig>  and 930918- <dig> , and identified differential gene complements in both strains. furthermore, for a specific subset of  <dig> genes that are non-fragmented and unique to either strain, we performed comparative pcr-based multi-locus genotyping. notably, the results revealed the unique presence of genes in the carrier strain derived from bovine pathogenicity islands   <cit> , possible constituents of the type vii secretion system   <cit>  and various other genes that are likely involved in pathogenesis. these studies provide a foundation for genome level analyses of s. aureus specific to human nasal carriage and will be instrumental in furthering our understanding of the carriage trait.

RESULTS
mlst analysis reveals no lineage specific differences between carrier and non-carrier strains of s. aureus
mlst analysis has been used as a powerful tool to identify lineage specific differences between various strains of a given bacterial species  <cit> . this technique has been applied extensively to s. aureus by several groups to characterize lineage specific differences in epidemiology  <cit>  and infectivity  <cit> . we used mlst to identify possible differences between carrier and non-carrier strains of s. aureus . for the test, we used the following strains d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and 930918- <dig>  the strains whose names start with "d" are clinical nasal isolates while 930918- <dig> served as the non-carrier control. we also analyzed  <dig> completely sequenced strains of s. aureus for their allele types .

* denotes strains sequenced in the study.

italicized strain names denote completely sequenced strains whose carriage status is unknown.

the dendrogram in figure  <dig> presents the evolutionary relationship between all strains of s. aureus. it is readily apparent from the dendrogram that there is no lineage distinction between carrier strains and the non-carrier strain . importantly, our model carrier strain  was on the same clade as was the model non-carrier strain . these results raised the possibility that bacterial determinants of nasal carriage result from the variable genome content of s. aureus. it is important to note that the variable genome of s. aureus is not entirely made of mobile genetic elements and presence of a gene in the chromosomal backbone does not establish it as a core genome component. thus, the determinants of nasal carriage, though necessarily a part of the variable genome, need not be restricted to those borne on mobile genetic elements.

genome sequencing and analysis of d <dig> and 930918- <dig> to identify differential gene content
mlst results revealed no lineage specific differences between the carrier and non-carrier strains. an analysis of s. aureus core and variable genomes revealed the presence of  <dig> genes in all  <dig> previously sequenced genomes. the remaining ~ <dig> genes were derived from the variable genome repertoire. such a large number of variable genes, many of which are borne on mobile genetic elements, generates staggering diversity and variability in the s. aureus genome  <cit> . such variability is compounded by the lack of carriage information for the completely sequenced strains and the lack of functional knowledge for most s. aureus genes. due to these reasons, meaningful inference regarding the genetic determinants of nasal carriage from these strains is not possible.

furthermore, genes that are reportedly necessary for nasal colonization  <cit>  were, as we determined, in fact a part of the common minimal genome , implying an innate capability for any s. aureus strain to colonize nasal epithelium. therefore, additional bacterial determinants are likely involved that can regulate the extent of nasal carriage. indeed, we have experimentally shown that not all strains are equally capable of establishing carriage or survival in presence of nasal fluids  <cit> . therefore, while certain genes necessary for nasal colonization have been functionally characterized, they may not be sufficient to establish carriage by themselves. to begin delineating genetic determinants of nasal carriage, we sequenced and compared the genomes of highly characterized carrier  and non-carrier  strain of s. aureus.

pyrosequencing was utilized to sequence strains d <dig> and 930918- <dig> to 15× and 16× coverage, respectively. to identify the genes that were found in these two strains, we mapped the raw sequence reads to all the genes in the staphylococcal pan-genome. we defined the staphylococcal pan-genome as the non-redundant orf set derived from all the staphylococcal genomes sequenced at the time of this report . for each orthologous set of genes identified by bidirectional best hit blast  <cit> , one representative gene was retained. the final pan-genome for the genus consisted of  <dig> orfs . we analyzed the whole staphylococcal pan-genome instead of the s. aureus pan-genome since an instance of horizontal gene transfer from s. epidermidis to s. aureus has been documented  <cit> .

the mapping of raw reads to orf's was a two-step process wherein we first removed orfs that were not represented in the raw reads. this step reduced the probable number of orfs from  <dig> to less than  <dig> . in the second step, each gene that had matching raw sequence reads was analyzed individually for its coverage and assembly gaps in both genomes.

all genes that could be assembled without gaps in the two genomes were considered to be present . in total,  <dig> genes in d <dig> and  <dig> genes in 930918- <dig> belonged to this group. the remaining genes  had varying degrees of gaps and coverage. for a gene with gaps, to be considered present in a given genome, the coverage threshold was set at 90%. applying the threshold to "tier 2" assemblies resulted in the selection of  <dig> genes in d <dig> and  <dig> genes in 930918- <dig>  in a very small number of cases  genes in "tier 3" had coverage of 90% or greater. owing to their high coverage, these tier  <dig> genes were also considered present in their respective genomes. table  <dig> summarizes the three tiers, the assembly and the gene coverage in the two strains. when the final gene content of tiers 1– <dig> were tabulated for any coverage >90%, the genomes of d <dig> and 930918- <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively , of which  <dig> genes were common to both strains. the overall gene content of the two strains depicted in figure  <dig> suggests that the non-carrier strain 930918- <dig> has a wider variable repertoire than does the carrier strain d <dig> 

total number of orfs considered in each strain is the sum of numbers represented in boldface for each tier.

once we had identified the genes for the each genome, we revised the cmg to include these two strains. now with  <dig> sequenced genomes, we observed that the overall cmg content had fallen to  <dig> genes from a previous estimate of  <dig> genes. on the other hand, the combined non-redundant variable genome of these two strains  comprised of  <dig> genes of which  <dig> were shared. thus the genomes of d <dig> and 930918- <dig> differed from each other by  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively . as a next step, we used the combined variable genome set  to assess the relationship between these strains and all previously sequenced strains. the results shown in figure 3b reiterate the trends observed in mlst dendrogram where d <dig> and 930918- <dig> are in the same clade as nctc <dig> and usa <dig> with col being a neighbor in the tree. however, the strains d <dig> and 930918- <dig> were closest to each other in their variable genome content.

analysis of d <dig> unique gene content reveals potential effectors of nasal carriage
there were  <dig> genes unique to the carrier strain d <dig>  out of which only  <dig> genes could be assigned functions based on their sequence similarity to genes in the non-redundant ncbi sequence database. we found  <dig> genes that were genetically linked to bovine pathogenicity island  . the genes bpi13: <dig> represent a fusion gene product in a single open reading frame. further, there were two genes encoding superantigen-like proteins and a capsular polysaccharide synthesis enzyme cap5p. other genes included oligopeptide transporter protein and an atp dependent proteinase, trag and ftsk/spoiiie family protein, a phislt lysin amongst others. the remaining  <dig> genes comprised of either hypothetical open reading frames  or transposons . the functional genes are discussed in detail below with implications for nasal carriage. a roster of these genes along with their annotation is given in additional file  <dig> 

bovine pathogenicity island  was first observed in s. aureus isolates extracted from teats of milk cows. it was described as a mobile element capable of exhibiting high variation and was shown to encode several super antigens including toxic shock antigen , and enterotoxin c  and was shown to modulate the host immune response  <cit> . however, the roles of other sapibov genes, including bpi <dig>  bpi13: <dig> and bpi <dig> are not known. presence of these genes uniquely in the strain d <dig> raises the possibility of their involvement in nasal carriage. the difference in bpi between d <dig> and 930918- <dig> are illustrated in figure 4a where the reference bpi map is adopted from citation  <cit> .

apart from the sapibov genes, the presence of trag and ftsk/spoiiie in d <dig> is particularly interesting. in a recent review discussing the presence of type vii secretion systems, abdallah and coworkers  <cit>  argue that ftsk/spoiiie family proteins are homologous to the type vii secretion systems  in mycobacteria . an independent report  <cit>  shows that a ftsk/spoiiie family member  and trag product act as a bipartite translocation system in an e. coli plasmid. further, studies by burts and coworkers show that the esx system is present in s. aureus  <cit>  and is necessary for pathogenesis in the s. aureus newman strain  <cit> . in both these reports, the authors mention the need for the ftsk/spoiiie family protein  for esx effector translocation. these reports, in conjunction with our results, suggest a role in nasal carriage for protein translocation systems in general and for t7ss in particular. while the t7ss transporter system was found uniquely in d <dig>  we did not find the known effector molecules in both strains. this is not to be construed as the presence of only a partial t7ss since the complete secretome associated with the t7ss in s. aureus is yet unknown and only a third of the genes in this pathogen have been assigned a function. the mobile genetic element that carries the trag and ftsk/spoiiie genes is shown in figure 4b.

another notable pair of genes that were unique to d <dig> was the urease  and clpl protease. ureases are important survival factors in various pathogens including helicobacteri pylori  <cit> , staphylococcus saphrophyticus  <cit> , and proteus mirabilis  <cit> . all these organisms use urease to withstand acidity or to enhance nitrogen utilization. further, in a genome wide transcriptome analysis, bore and colleagues  <cit>  show that acid shock response is tightly linked to antioxidant mechanisms in s. aureus and the urea gene shows considerable upregulation under acid stress.

while urea is directly linked to acid response specifically, the clpl gene is involved at a global level in mediating stress responses in s. aureus. the clp family of genes is implicated in a variety of stress responses, including but not limited to biofilm formation and heat shock responses  <cit> . this comprehensive analysis of responses mediated by various clp members demonstrated the role of clpb and clpl in conferring induced thermotolerance. it is possible that these genes would allow the strain d <dig> to counter a myriad of host innate immune responses in the nasal epithelium.

last in the list of putative nasal carriage modulators is the phislt orf <dig> like protein  gene. the phage phislt is known to be a helper phage for the pathogenic phage phi-pvl in s. aureus  <cit> . phislt is implicated in leukocytotoxicity and is known to lysogenize pvl phages and render them active. this phage carries a lytic locus that is similar to that of phi-pvl and may also be involved in pathogenesis directly. presence of these genes in d <dig>  and their absence in 930918- <dig>  suggests a role for many or all of them in nasal carriage.

the strain 930918- <dig> was larger than the strain d <dig> and shared  <dig> genes with the latter. strain 930918- <dig> has  <dig> unique genes of which  <dig>  were hypothetical orfs. however, contrary to unique gene set of d <dig>  the overall share of transposons was much less  and phages were the predominant mobile elements . of the remaining  <dig> genes, most were metabolic enzymes . there were also some pathogenesis related genes like the sapi protein, sapi integrase, phipvl encoded proteins and type i staphylococcal enterotoxin. the occurrence of these  <dig> genes in the pan-genome is illustrated in figure 3a .

the revised cmg, which incorporated the d <dig> and 930918- <dig> strains as well as the  <dig> previously sequenced strains of s. aureus, included  <dig> genes. although the size of the cmg was reduced by  <dig> genes once d <dig> and 930918- <dig> were added, genes necessary for globally mediating pathogenesis like the enterotoxins, tsst and the agr locus and many others were still a part of the cmg. further, comparison of cmg genes lost in d <dig> and 930918- <dig> showed that they shared  <dig> of the  <dig> missing genes of which  <dig> belonged to the same tier in either genome with gaps in very similar loci. in the  <dig> genes that did belong to different tiers,  <dig> genes had the same coverage in both strains. finally, only  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> genes had a higher coverage  in d <dig> as compared to 930918- <dig>  all four of these genes were hypothetical orfs whose functions are yet unknown. thus, the drastic reduction in cmg while stringent is unlikely to affect the current interpretation of the results.

as a next step, we stringently filtered the unique gene set to identify a specific subset of genes unique to d <dig>  and tested their distribution in  <dig> other strains capable of nasal carriage.

evidence for existence of multiple gene sets determining nasal carriage: pcr-based multilocus genotyping of carrier strains
there were  <dig> intact genes that were unique to the carrier strain, but fragments of a majority of these genes  were found in the strain 930918- <dig>  similarly, there were  <dig> intact genes in 930918- <dig> whose fragments were found in d <dig>  most of these genes were borne on mobile genetic elements and hence this observation was not completely unexpected. however, a set of  <dig> genes in d <dig> and  <dig> in 930918- <dig>  which had no fragments or vestiges in the other genome was termed the unique non-fragmented  genes. the list of the  <dig> unf genes in d <dig> is given in figure 4c while the complete list of unf genes in both genomes is provided in additional file  <dig>  we analyzed the unf set by pcr in six other carrier isolates and one strain  that when experimentally applied to the nose can intermittently colonize the nasal epithelium in certain individuals  <cit> . the result of the pcr-based genetic profiling of these  <dig> genes is summarized in figure 4c.

of the seven tested carrier strains, four  strains contained a majority these  <dig> genes. the closest was d <dig>  which contained  <dig> of the  <dig> genes while d <dig> and d <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes respectively. of particular importance was the presence of the transposon carrying trag and ftsk/spoiiie proteins, which are likely a part of the t7ss in s. aureus. presence of these genes in  <dig> carrier strains reinforces the possible role for t7ss in nasal carriage. further, presence of most of these genes in strains mrsa <dig> and usa <dig> may imply a carriage status for these strains. statistical tests based on randomly generated genomes  of s. aureus show that the presence of these genes in d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> is highly significant .

on the other hand, strains d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> contained very few  or none of the  <dig> genes . a similar trend was seen for the intermittent carrier strain 502-a . absence of the trag/ftsk/spoiiie system in these strains might denote the existence of more than one set of genes responsible for nasal carriage, or may signify that this system is required for persistent carriage in certain host types. overall, our results raise the possibility that nasal carriage is brought about by more than one set of genes. further, it is interesting that the strains 930918- <dig> and nctc <dig> share a similar profile in this clustering . these two strains, along with strain usa <dig> belonged to the same allotype as strain d <dig> . this observation reinforces our hypothesis that genetic determinants of nasal carriage are borne on mobile elements. the presence of these genes in  <dig> of the  <dig> carrier strains along with the functionality reported for the transporter complex  <cit>  argues against random inclusion of these genes in carrier strains, and reinforces their role in nasal carriage.

apart from being contributed to by whole genes and sets of genes, nasal carriage may also depend on other factors in the genome. foremost of these is the presence of nucleotide level polymorphisms in the genome. genes that play a role in nasal colonization of s. aureus like clumping factors  <cit>  and tagx  <cit>  also accumulate a high proportion of non-synonymous mutations . such variation in these genes could possibly affect the carriage capabilities of a given strain. additionally, nasal carriage involves a dynamic interplay between the host and the bacterium and as several reports indicate, there are host components involved. a comprehensive understanding of nasal carriage would require that these collective factors be addressed in context.

CONCLUSIONS
we have completely sequenced and compared the genomes of a highly characterized clinical nasal isolate of s. aureus  and a non-carrier s. aureus strain . comparison of orf content of these two strains revealed the presence of several genes in d <dig> that might be critical determinants of nasal carriage. the presence of ftsk/spoiiie family member and an associated protein trag uniquely in d <dig> implies a role for type vii secretion systems in s. aureus nasal carriage. while our work suggests a possible role for a type vii secretion system in nasal carriage, a complete genomic analysis of a large number of carrier strains, properly stratified from both intermittent carriers and persistent carriers, will be necessary to confirm this and elucidate other bacterial determinants of s. aureus nasal carriage.
