BACKGROUND
most viral infections induce cellular and humoral immune responses that act in concert to limit viral spread, clear infection and provide protective immunity against reinfection with the same virus. however, a number of viruses have evolved varied and sophisticated mechanisms to establish persistent infection, even in immunocompetent hosts  <cit> . epstein-barr virus  produces an interleukin-10-like virokine that functionally mimics il- <dig> in downregulating cellular immune responses  <cit> .

hepatitis c virus  causes significant morbidity and mortality. approximately 80% of hcv-exposed individuals develop life-long infection and in many cases, progressive liver disease  <cit> . immune escape through mutations introduced by the error prone hcv rna-dependent rna polymerase is believed to play a major role in the establishment of persistent hcv infection as strong, broadly directed cellular responses during acute infection are associated with hcv clearance, while narrow, qualitatively impaired anti-hcv responses occur in chronic infection  <cit> . clearance of hcv after interferon-alpha  and ribavirin therapy is also associated with greater breadth and amplitude of anti-hcv cellular immunity  <cit> . these associations suggest that development of appropriate adaptive immune responses relates closely to hcv clearance.

the relatively small rna genome of hcv encodes few proteins, all of which are involved in some way with virion structure or virus replication. hence, any immunosuppressive activity must reflect secondary functions of the structural or non-structural hcv proteins. core, non-structural protein  <dig> , ns <dig> and ns <dig> have been investigated for a variety of secondary functions. the  <dig> kda hcv core protein is associated with cellular transformation in vitro and modulation of cytokine signalling and cellular immune responses  <cit> . the ns <dig> serine protease downregulates immunoproteosome activity in vitro and may impair immune recognition  <cit> . ns <dig> is comprised of ns4a and ns4b, two proteins involved in viral replication. ns4a acts as a cofactor in forming the active protease ns4a/ns <dig> that participates in polyprotein processing during hcv replication  <cit> , while ns4b is essential for replication and seems to affect the intracellular membranous web where viral replication occurs  <cit> . ns5a inhibits antiviral pkr activity through its interferon sensitivity determining region   <cit> . thus, multiple hcv proteins appear to have evolved secondary functions affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses.

viral infection generally triggers production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but as described above, viruses have evolved gene products that promote persistent infection by tipping the cytokine balance towards immunosuppression. the setting in which viral exposure initially occurs is also relevant, therefore, we compared induction of cytokines by hcv proteins in pbmc from uninfected, hcv-infected, hiv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals. production of the immunosuppressive cytokine il- <dig> was selectively triggered by hcv proteins, and the response was greater in hiv-monoinfected and uninfected individuals than in those exposed to hcv. this pattern suggests that selective induction of il- <dig> in uninfected individuals and especially in hiv-monoinfected individuals plays a role in establishing chronic hcv infection and conversely, that attenuation of this response, once chronic infection is established, favours development of hepatic immunopathology.

RESULTS
study participants
eight healthy volunteers from st. john's nl, canada provided blood samples for the study. twenty-four hiv-infected,  <dig> hiv/hcv-coinfected, and  <dig> hcv-infected individuals were also recruited, and table  <dig> describes the baseline characteristics of the infected groups. the age and sex of participants was similar across groups. most individuals exposed to hcv developed chronic infection, although  <dig> of the hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals had cleared the virus and were anti-hcv antibody positive but hcv rna negative. hiv related clinical parameters were similar between groups, although there was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward higher cd4+ t cell counts in the coinfected group. most hiv-infected individuals were on antiviral therapy and had achieved viral suppression at the time of participation. only one of the hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals had been treated  with hcv antiviral therapy, and the remainder of hcv exposed patients were untreated.

exposure to hcv proteins induces il- <dig> production in pbmc
to investigate the cytokine response of pbmc from different groups of individuals to hcv proteins, we incubated pbmc from uninfected, hiv-infected, hcv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals for  <dig> hours with hcv core, ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins. production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ and il- <dig> was then assessed by intracellular flow cytometry. positive controls for each of these four cytokines demonstrated the efficacy of the antibodies . in no case did any of the hcv antigens, individually or together, induce il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, or il- <dig> production . however, il-10+cd3-cd19-cd14-cd36+cd61+cells with lymphoid light scatter characteristics increased in number following for  <dig> hours exposure to hcv proteins . we previously described these il-10+ cells in freshly-isolated pbmc from uninfected individuals, but found that their number fell to almost undetectable levels following  <dig> hour incubation in unsupplemented lymphocyte medium  <cit> . all of the individuals in this study  had circulating cd36+cd61+ pbmc constitutively producing il- <dig> . the average percentage of pbmc producing il- <dig> ex vivo ranged from  <dig> %  in the hcv-infected group to  <dig> %  in the uninfected group. although there was a trend towards a lower frequency of these cells in the hiv-infected, hcv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected groups, there was no statistically significant difference . as previously described, in the absence of stimulation, the percentage of pbmc producing il- <dig> in vitro decreased over time in infected and uninfected individuals . the uninfected group had the highest frequency of il- <dig> producing cells ex vivo , however, after for  <dig> hours incubation in lymphocyte medium alone, il-10+ cell frequency fell to similar levels in all groups . the mean frequencies were slightly lower in the uninfected and hcv-infected groups compared to the hiv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected groups  but not significantly different. the pattern of il- <dig> production in response to hcv proteins differed substantially between groups . after  <dig> hour exposure to hcv proteins, the average frequency of il-10+ cells rose to  <dig> %  in pbmc from hiv-infected individuals,  <dig> %  in uninfected individuals,  <dig> %  in hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals, and  <dig> %  in hcv-infected individuals. the number of il-10+ cells detected by flow cytometry following  <dig> hour exposure to the hcv proteins was significantly higher in the hiv-infected group compared to the hcv-infected  and hiv/hcv coinfected  groups . the effect of  <dig> hour exposure to hcv proteins on the number of il-10+ pbmc was quite substantial  in hiv-infected and uninfected control groups, while the increase in hcv-infected individuals, with or without hiv coinfection, was marginal . if all the chronic hcv-infected individuals from the hiv/hcv and hcv monoinfected groups are combined into one group , there is still a significant difference between il- <dig> induction in the hiv monoinfected group and the combined hcv chronic infection group . il- <dig> induction when hcv proteins were added together or individually was not different .

there were two clear populations of il- <dig> positive cells based on the level of cd <dig> expression. approximately 30% of the il- <dig> positive cells had a cd <dig> mean channel fluorescence  greater than  <dig>  and the remainder were between  <dig> and  <dig> . cells with higher cd <dig> mean channel fluorescence  were more likely to be il- <dig> positive, with 100% of cd36hi cells il-10+ versus 50–70% cd36low cells il-10+ . there is a statistically significant difference in the mean channel fluorescence of the cd36loil-10lo group compared to the cd36hiil-10hi group . this association raises the possibility of a mechanistic link between high cd <dig> expression and il- <dig> production.

il- <dig> induction is specific to hcv proteins, and independent of t cells and lysosomal antigen processing
to determine whether induction of il- <dig> was selective for hcv proteins, we also exposed pbmc from  <dig> uninfected and  <dig> hiv-infected individuals to hiv p <dig> protein. unlike the hcv proteins, hiv p <dig> did not increase il- <dig> production in pbmc relative to the β-galactosidase controls . therefore, hcv core, ns <dig> and ns <dig> selectively induce il- <dig> production in pbmc. to confirm that il- <dig> induction did not result from endotoxin contamination of the hcv antigen preparations, we incubated pbmc from  <dig> uninfected and  <dig> hiv/hcv coinfected individuals with hcv proteins in the presence of polymixin b, an endotoxin blocker. inclusion of polymixin b in the assays had no effect on induction of il- <dig> in hcv-exposed pbmc . to test whether antigen processing of the hcv proteins was required for induction of il- <dig>  we inhibited the lysosomal antigen processing pathway with chloroquine in pbmc from uninfected, hiv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals exposed to hcv proteins . chloroquine treatment did not significantly affect the il-10+ cell frequency in pbmc from uninfected or hiv/hcv-coinfected groups exposed to hcv proteins .

since the hcv proteins had the greatest effect on il- <dig> induction in pbmc from hiv-infected individuals and reduced cd4+ and total t cell numbers is an integral aspect of hiv infection, we decided to test if the absence of t cells affected the il- <dig> response to hcv proteins. therefore, we depleted cd3+ t cells from the pbmc of  <dig> individuals in each of the hiv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected groups  and assessed il- <dig> production with and without exposure to hcv proteins . the percentage of pbmc producing il- <dig> constitutively or in response to hcv proteins was essentially unaffected by t cell depletion after correction for t cell depletion.

relationship between il- <dig> induction and hcv-specific t cell proliferation
since il- <dig> is an immunomodulatory cytokine that suppresses th <dig> type adaptive immunity, we investigated the relationship between il- <dig> induction by hcv proteins and hcv-specific t cell proliferation in  <dig> hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals. a positive hcv-specific proliferation response  was observed in only one individual , who demonstrated a positive response to hcv core but not ns <dig> and ns <dig>  after  <dig> hour exposure to hcv antigens,  <dig> of the  <dig> coinfected individuals tested demonstrated an hcv protein-induced increase in the number of il-10+ cells . of note, subject  <dig> was one of the four individuals who did not have increased numbers of il-10+ cells following exposure to hcv proteins.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that hcv core, ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins specifically and selectively induce il- <dig> production when incubated for  <dig> hours with pbmc. the cells producing il- <dig> in response to the hcv proteins were identified by flow cytometry as cd14-cd36+ with lymphoid light scatter characteristics. we previously reported constitutive ex vivo production of il- <dig> by this pbmc subset and that this production rapidly stops in vitro  <cit> . these cells do not fit into one of the major subpopulations of circulating immune cells, but can be reliably isolated from all healthy individuals tested at a frequency of up to 1%. the ex vivo frequency of il-10-producing pbmc was generally equivalent in the four distinct groups we studied, indicating that the differences seen after  <dig> hour culture were caused by differential responses to the hcv proteins. while  <dig> hour culture with hcv proteins increased the number of il-10-producing cells in all groups, the frequency of il-10+ cells was higher in pbmc from hiv-infected individuals and uninfected controls compared to pbmc from hiv/hcv coinfected individuals or hcv-infected individuals. this demonstrates a propensity for hcv-induced il- <dig> production by pbmc from uninfected individuals that is exaggerated by hiv infection and attenuated by chronic hcv infection, even in the setting of hiv coinfection.

we used recombinant hcv core, ns <dig> and ns <dig> to investigate cytokine production in response to hcv proteins. although these three proteins have little sequence or structural similarity and their known functions in hcv replication are very different  <cit> , we found that, collectively or individually, hcv core, ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins induced il- <dig> production in cd14-cd36+ pbmc. others have also reported that recombinant hcv core, ns <dig> and ns <dig> proteins all induce il- <dig> production  <cit> . however, in these studies, monocytes were identified as the responding cells and, in direct contrast to our results, there was a greater effect on monocytes from hcv-infected individuals than on monocytes from uninfected controls  <cit> . these studies utilized monocytes isolated by overnight adherence to plastic, rather than freshly isolated pbmc. despite varying protocols and different characteristics of the responding cells, the central point is that multiple distinct hcv proteins stimulate il- <dig> production by pbmc. there are other examples of redundancy in hcv protein effects as mice transgenic for hepatic hcv structural or non-structural polyproteins develop hepatic steatosis characteristic of chronic hcv infection  <cit> . such functional redundancy of viral proteins is not unique to hcv, as three different hiv proteins  have all been reported to induce il- <dig> production by various pbmc subsets  <cit> .

in our study, structural and non-structural hcv proteins induced il- <dig>  having both structural and non-structural proteins with redundant immunosuppressive functions may be important in sustaining infection. the availability of these proteins in circulation is temporally separated, and not concurrent. non-structural proteins are only expressed in actively infected cells, while the core protein can be found in plasma at moderately high levels throughout chronic infection  <cit> . having multiple proteins that induce il- <dig> supports production of an immunosuppressive cytokine whether or not hcv replication is upregulated or infectious virions are present.

in parallel with the redundancy in hcv protein-induced il- <dig> production, additional hcv escape mechanisms within both the innate and adaptive immune system have been extensively described. subversion of the eukaryotic anti-viral interferon-inducible system is a potent evasion strategy employed by many viruses, and several hcv proteins suppress host proteins in this system. hcv e <dig> inactivates pkr  <cit> , and the hcv serine protease ns3/4a causes proteolysis of toll-il- <dig> receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing ifn-β   <cit> , and inhibits phosphorylation of irf- <dig>  preventing nuclear translocation and ifn-β gene activation  <cit> . hcv e <dig> has also been associated with decreased nk cell function and hcv core stabilizes hla-e expression and subsequently downregulates nk-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> . hcv core, e <dig>  ns <dig>  and ns <dig> are all associated with impaired dendritic cell maturation, thus potentially modulating the function of this integral link to adaptive cellular immunity  <cit> . hcv core also downregulates in vitro anti-hcv t cell responses  <cit> . while the exact mechanism of hcv protein interaction is unclear, il- <dig> inhibits dendritic cell maturation, resulting in an immature phenotype similar to that seen after exposure to hcv core  <cit> . not only do hcv proteins modulate immune responses, it is clear that more than one protein has evolved to share similar functions. production of il- <dig> by the cell population described in this paper may stunt dendritic cell maturation, and impair development of anti-hcv cellular immunity through this pathway as well as through a direct effect on responding t cells.

the mechanism for il- <dig> induction in pbmc by hcv proteins is unknown, but processing of soluble hcv antigens through the endocytic pathway is unnecessary as blocking antigen processing had no effect on constitutive or induced il- <dig> production. a higher percentage of cells from hiv-infected individuals than uninfected controls produced il- <dig> in response to hcv proteins. this appears unrelated to lower t cell function in hiv infection as depletion of cd3+ pbmc also did not affect constitutive or hcv-induced il- <dig> production by the cd14-cd36+ pbmc.

the direct correlation between intracellular il- <dig> production and intensity of cell surface cd <dig> expression supports a possible connection between these molecules. ligands of cd <dig>  a scavenger receptor, include oxidized low density lipoproteins , thrombospondin, collagen types i and iv, apoptotic cells, long chain fatty acids and plasmodium-infected erythrocytes  <cit> . at least  <dig> of these ligands, thrombospondin and apoptotic cells, have immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> . in addition, peroxisomal proliferator associated receptor-γ  mediated differentiation of monocytes towards a less inflammatory status is accompanied by up-regulation of cd <dig>  which has been used to clinical advantage in cerebral malaria  <cit> . while there is circumstantial evidence for a link between cd <dig> and induction of il- <dig>  there has been no reported evidence of interactions between hcv or any of its individual components and cd <dig>  hcv associates with low density lipoproteins in circulation, and uses the ldl receptor and cd <dig> to enter cells  <cit> . cd <dig> is not an hcv cellular receptor however, recent studies suggest that hcv and the cd <dig> ligand oxldl do interact  <cit> . hcv proteins may indirectly activate il- <dig> production through a cd <dig> related mechanism.

il- <dig> is an important immunomodulatory cytokine, and recent experiments in the lcmv model of chronic viral infection showed that manipulating levels of il- <dig> alone was sufficient to dictate lcmv clearance or persistence  <cit> . however, studies comparing plasma il- <dig> levels in hcv-infected and healthy individuals have been less definitive, with some studies describing control levels of serum il- <dig> in chronic hcv infection, while other groups describe a marked increase in il- <dig> in chronic infection  <cit> . this raises questions about the value of serum il- <dig> measurements, as il- <dig> has important localized paracrine effects that are not reflected by these generalized il- <dig> determinations. as well, none of these studies determine il- <dig> levels during acute infection when it may be pivotal in the establishment of chronic infection. we demonstrated that exposure to hcv antigens in chronically infected individuals produced less il- <dig> than seen in hcv naïve individuals. longer term exposure to hcv antigens apparently conditions the cd36+ population of il-10+ cells, attenuating hcv protein specific il- <dig> induction. thus, il- <dig> levels during acute infection may be more relevant to the establishment of persistent infection than to maintaining chronic infection.

the transience of il- <dig> responses to hcv proteins may allow emergence of cellular immune responses that are pathological in the context of chronic hcv infection. several studies indicate a protective role for il- <dig> in the immunopathology of hcv infection including a clinical trial of exogenous il- <dig> administration, accumulation of il- <dig> producing cd5+ b cells in hcv-infected individuals with mild disease and an association between high il- <dig> gene polymorphism and decreased rates of hcv-related liver fibrosis  <cit> . the diminution in il- <dig> induction seen in chronic hcv after hcv protein exposure appears to parallel, and possibly support, insidiously progressive liver disease.

coinfection with hiv is an important issue in hcv infection because of its relatively high prevalence, higher hcv virus loads in hiv/hcv coinfected individuals and because of increased hcv-related morbidity in hiv coinfected individuals  <cit> . the higher level of il- <dig> induction in pbmc from hiv-infected individuals may allow the establishment of more aggressive hcv infection, with downregulation of anti-hcv responses permitting increased hcv replication and higher hcv virus loads. however, this could depend on the order of hcv and hiv infection, with stronger anti-hcv cellular immunity developing when hcv infection precedes hiv-associated cd8+ t cell activation during the asymptomatic phase of hiv infection. enhanced cd8+ t cell immunity against hcv in hcv/hiv coinfected individuals is likely to accelerate liver disease, while those who acquire hcv following the generalized decline in cellular immunity associated with progressive hiv infection are likely to have especially weak hcv-specific cellular immunity. thus, there are  <dig> distinct groups of hiv/hcv coinfected individuals with respect to hcv-specific cellular immunity and its potential role in viral suppression and in the pathogenesis of liver disease.

chronic hcv infection mitigates il- <dig> production induced by hcv proteins. this is true in the group of three hcv monoinfected individuals, as well as the  <dig> hiv/hcv coinfected people. though the monoinfected group is small, the two groups with chronic hcv infection have a total of thirteen individuals, and both have similar results. the limited il- <dig> response is even more marked considering that the hiv monoinfected group has the highest il- <dig> induction of all groups. therefore, the lack of il- <dig> induction in the setting of chronic infection is likely not an artifact of the small sample size, but a real phenomenon that can even supplant the expected hiv-associated il- <dig> induction.

consistent with previous reports, we found that hcv specific t cell proliferation is rare in chronic hcv infection with hiv coinfection a <cit> . in fact, the only individual with anti-hcv proliferative responses is also one of the individuals with the least number of il- <dig> producing cells after hcv protein exposure.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the presence of a novel population of pbmc that act differentially in response to hcv proteins in uninfected and hiv- or hcv-infected individuals. this differential il- <dig> response to hcv antigens is consistent with the generation of an immunoregulatory environment that promotes viral persistence in acute exposure while allowing disease progression in the chronic state. the behaviour of this cd36+cd14- population offers insight into how hcv establishes viral persistence through decreased cellular immune responses and how this is exacerbated by hiv infection.
