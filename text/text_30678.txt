BACKGROUND
volatile organic compounds  play multiple roles in the interactions of plants with their environment. floral and fruit vocs, for example, are known as attractants for pollinators and seed dispersers, respectively, while vegetative vocs are reported to have various functions in inter- and intra-plant communication and plant defense against herbivores and pathogens  <cit> . the emission of vocs from vegetative plant organs is often induced by biotic stresses like insect herbivory  <cit> . such induced volatile blends can attract natural enemies of the herbivores, a reaction termed indirect defense  <cit> . for example, the volatile blends from herbivore-infested arabidopsis thaliana, black poplar  and maize  have been described to be attractive for different parasitoids  <cit> . however, beside their role as signals in indirect defense, herbivore-induced vegetative vocs can also function in direct defense as toxins and repellants for herbivores  <cit> .

in general, herbivore-induced volatile blends are often dominated by terpenes but also comprise other classes of natural compounds including green leaf volatiles, alcohols, esters, and nitrogen-containing volatiles. terpenes represent the largest and most diverse group of plant secondary metabolites  <cit> . they are built up of isoprenoid  units which have their origin either in the mevalonate pathway or in the 2-c-methylerythritol-4-phosphate  pathway. a head to tail condensation of such c <dig> units catalyzed by prenyltransferases leads to the formation of geranyl diphosphate , farnesyl diphosphate , and geranylgeranyl diphosphate . terpene synthases , the key enzymes of terpene metabolism, convert these precursors into the huge number of different terpene carbon skeletons  <cit> . most plant genomes possess a mid-size gene family encoding terpene synthases  <cit> . based on their phylogenetic relationships, plant tpss can be classified into seven different clades  <cit> . tps-a, tps-b and tps-g are angiosperm-specific clades with the tps-a clade containing predominantly sesquiterpene synthases and the tps-b and tps-g clades consisting mostly of monoterpene synthases. the tps-d clade comprising mono-, sesqui- and diterpene synthases and the tps-h clade comprising diterpene synthases are gymnosperm- and lycopod-  specific, respectively. the gymnosperm and angiosperm copalyl diphosphate synthases  and kaurene synthases  make up the tps-c and tpse/f clades, respectively. recently, a new class of terpene synthases was found in s. moellendorffii which showed sequence similarity to microbial terpene synthases and were designated as microbial terpene synthase like  genes  <cit> .

while a few terpene synthases do function in plant primary metabolism, for example, in gibberellin biosynthesis, the majority functions in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites involved in ecological interactions. due to the prominent occurrence of terpenes in herbivore-induced volatile blends  <cit> , terpene synthases have received a lot of attention and much evidence exists for their involvement in plant defense. for example, the introduction of a sesquiterpene synthase gene from wild tomato  into a cultivated tomato line resulted in an increased herbivore resistance  <cit> . the overexpression of a linalool synthase in a. thaliana also increased the resistance of this plant against aphids  <cit> . additionally, herbivory-induced terpene synthases from lima bean  and maize, for example, are reported to produce sesquiterpenes which have been shown to attract natural enemies of insect herbivores  <cit> .

the majority of information about plant responses to herbivory is mainly based on herbaceous plants. however, in recent years an increasing number of studies on volatile-mediated plant defense have been carried out on woody species from both the gymnosperms and angiosperms. it is known, for example, that poplar emits a complex volatile blend after being damaged by herbivores  <cit> . although monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are described to be the most dominant compounds emitted, only  <dig> terpene synthase genes have been isolated and characterized from poplar to date. these include the isoprene synthase  from p. alba x p. tremula  <cit> , ptdtps <dig> from p. trichocarpa x p. deltoides  <cit> , pntps <dig> and pntps <dig> from black poplar   <cit>  and four tps  from western balsam poplar   <cit> , the species of populus that has been fully sequenced  <cit> .

in this report we describe the identification and functional characterization of the tps gene family of p. trichocarpa consisting of thirty-eight members. fifteen tps genes could be isolated from herbivore-damaged leaves, of which eleven have not been characterized before. a qrt-pcr analysis revealed that the majority of these genes were upregulated after herbivory indicating their potential involvement in plant defense. to study the spatial regulation of herbivore-induced volatile biosynthesis in more detail, we carried out a comprehensive volatile collection from a single herbivore-infested leaf and from individual neighboring undamaged leaves and compared the observed volatile pattern with tps gene expression data as well as with phytohormone levels in these tissues.

RESULTS
the tps gene family in p. trichocarpa
to identify the members of the tps gene family in p. trichocarpa, we conducted a blast analysis using the second improved version of the poplar genome . this analysis revealed  <dig> full length tps genes which encode for putative proteins with a minimal length of  <dig> amino acids including the previously published genes pttps1- <dig>  <cit>  . additionally,  <dig> tps gene fragments were found in the database. bacterial-like tpss as already described for s. moellendorffii  <cit>  were not identified in the poplar genome. six of the seven tps gene subfamilies were represented in the  <dig> complete poplar tpss   <cit> . the tps-a subfamily with  <dig> members and the tps-b subfamily with  <dig> members made up the majority of poplar tpss, while only two members each fell into the tps-g, tps-c and the tps-e subfamilies and only one tps gene clustered within the tps-f subfamily. as the members of the tps-c and tps-e subfamily most likely represent copalyl diphosphate synthases and kaurene synthases , respectively, which are not involved in volatile biosynthesis, we did not focus on these in more detail in this study. the chromosomal position was assigned to  <dig> of the full-length tps genes, and these were found to be located on eleven of the nineteen poplar chromosomes. about one third of the tps genes and half of the tps gene fragments were found on chromosome  <dig>  suggesting the occurrence of multiple duplication and recombination events on this chromosome . on other chromosomes, a maximum number of three tps genes were found. nine tps genes and  <dig> tps gene fragments were not linked to poplar chromosomes based on the new genome version. many of these sequences share a high degree of nucleotide identity which makes annotation and assignment in the genome difficult. therefore one could still expect changes in the actual numbers of poplar tps genes and their locations as newer versions of the poplar genome are released.figure  <dig>

isolation of poplar tps genes and their structural features
using cdna made from gypsy moth -damaged p. trichocarpa leaves,  <dig> open reading frames of tps genes could be amplified and cloned. eleven of them represented poplar tps genes which have not been characterized and described before. following the nomenclature of danner and coworkers , the genes were designated as pttps <dig> to pttps <dig> . based on their sequence similarity to so far characterized poplar tps and representative tps from other plant species , the proteins encoded by pttps5- <dig> were tentatively classified as four monoterpene synthases  , six sesquiterpene synthases   and a diterpene synthase  . pttps5- <dig> all had a length between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids  and contained typical conserved elements including the ddxxd motif and the nse/dte motifs , both of which are involved in the binding of the metal cofactor  <cit> . interestingly, pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> possessed an altered nse/dte motif which contained a glycine residue instead of the serine/threonine. another typical sequence motif, the rr 8 w motif in the n-terminal part was also changed and expressed as rp 8 w in pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> and was completely absent in pttps <dig>  another conserved protein sequence of terpene synthases is the rxr-motif implicated in the complexation of the diphosphate group after ionization of the substrate  <cit> . in pttps <dig>  the rxr motif was modified to rxq, which is also present in pttps <dig>  <cit> . tps <dig>  a putative diterpene synthase, showed an rxk motif at this position .

in general, mts and dts contain n-terminal signal peptides which target these proteins to the plastids, the site of gpp and ggpp biosynthesis  <cit> . in contrast, sesquiterpene synthases are localized in the cytosol where fpp serves as the substrate for this enzyme class. the targetp  <dig>  server  was used for signal peptide prediction. a plastid transit peptide was predicted for pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  supporting their roles as mts in plastids. however, no signal peptide could be predicted for the putative mts pttps <dig> and the putative dts pttps <dig> 

heterologous expression and in vitro functional characterization of poplar tpss
for functional characterization of poplar tps, all isolated tps genes were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. to ensure that the predicted signal peptides did not interfere with expression, truncated versions of pttps <dig> , pttps <dig>  and pttps <dig>  were expressed. the truncations were chosen so that the rr 8w-motif was still present. proteins from raw extracts were assayed with gpp, fpp and ggpp, each in the presence of the co-substrate magnesium chloride, to determine monoterpene-, sesquiterpene- and diterpene- forming activity, respectively.

all putative mts  accepted gpp as substrate and produced monoterpenes . pttps <dig> formed -β-ocimene as the major product with minor amounts of -β-ocimene. a similar narrow product specificity could also be observed for pttps <dig>  which produced only linalool, and pttps <dig> which formed linalool and trace amounts of β-phellandrene, -β-ocimene and α-terpinolene. however, pttps <dig> made five monoterpenes including α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene,  <dig> -cineole and α-terpineol. the incubation of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> with fpp revealed no product formation. in contrast, pttps <dig> showed a broad sesquiterpene product spectrum and produced at least  <dig> different sesquiterpenes with γ-curcumene being the major one, and pttps <dig> was able to convert fpp to nerolidol .figure  <dig>

pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  the enzymes were expressed in e. coli, extracted, partially purified, and incubated with the substrates fpp, gpp and ggpp. products were collected with a solid-phase microextraction  fiber and analyzed by gc-ms.  <dig>  elemol;  <dig>  β-eudesmol*;  <dig>  unidentified sesquiterpene alcohol;  <dig>  -β-caryophyllene*;  <dig>  α-humulene*;  <dig>  β-elemene*;  <dig>  eremophilene;  <dig>  α-selinene*;  <dig>  unidentified sesquiterpene;  <dig>  γ-curcumene*;  <dig>  nerolidol*;  <dig>  -β-ocimene*;  <dig>  myrcene*;  <dig>  limonene*;  <dig>  terpinolene*;  <dig>  linalool*;  <dig>  sabinene*;  <dig>   <dig> -cineole*;  <dig>  terpineol*;  <dig>  geranyllinalool*; cont., contamination. compounds marked with * were identified using authentic standards.



four out of the  <dig> putative sts were able to convert fpp into different sesquiterpenes . pttps <dig> produced -β-caryophyllene and smaller amounts of α-humulene. in contrast, pttps <dig> showed a broader product spectrum comprising  <dig> different sesquiterpenes with β-elemene, eremophilene, α-selinene and an unidentified sesquiterpene representing the major peaks. such complex product spectra could also be observed for pttps <dig>  producing at least  <dig> different sesquiterpenes dominated by an unidentified sesquiterpene alcohol, and for pttps <dig> producing more than  <dig> different sesquiterpenes with elemol being the main product. because the sesquiterpenes β-elemene  and elemol  are known to arise as thermal rearrangement products from germacrene a  <cit>  and hedycaryol  <cit> , respectively, during hot gc injection, the products of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> were also analyzed using a colder gc injector . although β-elemene and elemol were still present in the gc chromatograms, an expansion of the germacrene a peak  and hedycaryol peak  could be observed, demonstrating the genuine activity of these enzymes . in contrast to pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  the putative sts pttps <dig> showed only marginal activity with fpp and produced trace amounts of germacrene d . pttps <dig>  however, produced no sesquiterpenes. when offered gpp as a substrate, pttps <dig> formed several monoterpenes including myrcene, limonene, terpinolene and linalool . concerning the other sts, either trace activity  or no activity  was observed with gpp . as predicted, pttps <dig> represented a dts and was able to convert ggpp into geranyllinalool. neither gpp nor fpp was accepted by pttps <dig>  none of the other tpss was able to accept ggpp as substrate.

a chiral analysis demonstrated that pttps <dig> formed exclusively the -enantiomer of -β-caryophyllene . for pttps <dig>  the sesquiterpene product was -nerolidol while the monoterpene product was -linalool . a racemic mixture of -linalool was made by pttps <dig> . pttps <dig> formed -β-elemene  which corresponds to -germacrene a as the actual enzyme product because the stereochemical configuration is retained at c <dig>  <cit> .

tps gene expression is affected by herbivory
to analyze whether the expression of pttps5- <dig> is influenced by herbivory, the transcript abundance of these genes was measured using qrt-pcr in apical, herbivore-damaged leaves  see material and methods) compared to the respective undamaged leaves from control trees. the expression levels of pttps5- <dig> generally increased after herbivore attack . six of these genes were slightly upregulated, about 2- to 8-fold, with the increases in transcript accumulation significant for pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> but not for pttps <dig> and pttps11/ <dig> . repeated sequencing of amplicons from pttps11/14-qrt-pcr reactions revealed a 1: <dig> ratio of pttps <dig> to pttps <dig> transcript. a larger significant induction could be shown for pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  with  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher transcript abundance, respectively, in the damaged leaf compared to the undamaged control leaf . pttps <dig> showed the strongest response to herbivore damage with a  <dig> -fold increase in transcript abundance . no qrt-pcr analysis was performed for pttps <dig> as no activity could be observed for the corresponding protein. altogether the qrt-analysis showed distinct differences in the Δcq values  for the identified pttps genes . pttps11/ <dig> and pttps <dig> had Δcq-values higher than  <dig> indicating low expression levels. in contrast, small Δcq-values were observed for pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> indicating higher transcript abundance compared to the other pttps genes.figure  <dig>

leaf age and position influence the quantitative composition of the herbivore-induced volatile blend
our previous studies  <cit>  already documented the complex volatile bouquet released from entire p. trichocarpa trees after damage by gypsy moth. to address the question of whether terpene emission is influenced by leaf age and position, we carried out a volatile collection from individual leaves . a wax  column with a length of 60 m was used for gc-ms analysis to ensure a better separation of the complex volatile mixtures. single herbivore-damaged leaves emitted up to  <dig> different volatiles of which  <dig> could be identified . as previously described, -β-ocimene, a monoterpene, and -α-farnesene, a sesquiterpene likely produced by the sesquiterpene synthase pttps <dig>  were the most abundant volatiles   <cit> . furthermore, the emission of -3-hexenol, 2-phenylethanol, benzaldehyde, benzyl cyanide and indole were also highly induced after herbivore feeding . in contrast to damaged leaves, neighboring non-infested leaves emitted only minor amounts of volatiles comparable to leaves from non-infested control trees, indicating that no systemic induction took place.figure  <dig>

leaves after herbivory restricted to an apical or basal leaf or no herbivory. volatiles of eight single leaves, leaf plastochron indices  <dig> to  <dig>  were measured from either control trees , trees which received herbivory apically on leaf lpi <dig>  or basally on leaf lpi <dig> . after separation by gc, the peaks were identified by ms and quantified using an fid. means and standard errors are shown . to test for statistical significance between the treatments in one leaf position, a one way analysis of variance  was performed. different letters show significant differences. germacrene d, tmtt and nerolidol were not tested for significance. l ratios and p values are given in additional file 2: table s <dig> 



a comparison of the volatile blends released from uninfested leaves of different age stages  revealed quantitative differences for single compounds within the tree . in undamaged control trees, linalool  and -β-ocimene  were mainly emitted from younger apical leaves whereas -3-hexenol , nonanal  and nonanol  were more dominant in the volatile blends emitted from older basal leaves. however, -β-caryophyllene  and -α-farnesene  were emitted in similar amounts independent of leaf position . after herbivore infestation of a younger apical leaf  or an older basal leaf , this developmental difference became even clearer. younger damaged leaves near the apex generally emitted more terpenes , benzaldehyde  and the ester phenylethyl acetate  compared to older damaged leaves near the base . however, the alcohol nonanol was found to be released in higher quantities from older damaged leaves . nitrogen-containing compounds displayed a similar induction pattern independent of the leaf age, except for phenylnitroethane  and indole , which were more abundant in younger damaged leaves, .

the local and systemic emission of -β-ocimene and -β-caryophyllene can be correlated to the expression patterns of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  respectively
to determine whether local and systemic terpene emission pattern are reflected by tps gene expression, the transcript abundance of the -β-ocimene synthase pttps <dig> and the -β-caryophyllene synthase pttps <dig> were measured in gypsy moth-damaged leaves , the closest neighboring leaves  and the leaves to which they are most closely vascularly connected   <cit> . pttps <dig> gene expression was significantly increased in both herbivore-damaged lpi <dig> and lpi <dig> leaves. however, the induction was greater in the younger apical lpi <dig> leaf than in the older basal lpi <dig> leaf . in contrast, pttps <dig> was slightly induced in the apical lpi <dig> leaf and not induced in the basal lpi <dig> leaf . altogether, transcript abundance of pttps <dig> was strongly upregulated in herbivore-damaged leaves in comparison to the most adjacent leaves and vascularly connected leaves of the damaged tree as well as in comparison to all leaves measured on undamaged control trees. on the other hand, pttps <dig> gene expression was hardly influenced by herbivory. no significant upregulation of pttps <dig> transcripts in neighboring leaves or vascularly connected leaves could be detected .figure  <dig>

the concentrations of jasmonates increased in herbivore-damaged leaves
as herbivore-induced volatile emission is commonly mediated by jasmonates and other phytohormones  <cit> , we measured the concentrations of these compounds in individual leaves  of trees which suffered herbivory either on an apical leaf  or a basal leaf . as illustrated in figure  <dig>  undamaged control trees showed a gradient for abscisic acid  and salicylic acid  within the tree with higher concentrations in younger leaves. conversely, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid  concentrations increased in older basal leaves  while jasmonic acid  and its isoleucine conjugates , -jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine and -7-iso-jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine, were equally distributed throughout the tree . upon herbivore damage, the concentrations of ja and ja-ile conjugates increased significantly and specifically in the damaged leaves independent of leaf position compared to undamaged leaves of control trees and leaves within the same tree . a significant induction of sa, aba and opda occurred only after apical damage in damaged leaves or below .figure  <dig>

discussion
the tps-a and tps-b subfamilies in poplar are large and consist of members arisen by duplication events
land plants generally possess a mid-size tps gene family resulting from repeated gene duplication  <cit> . in this study we documented that the genome of p. trichocarpa contains  <dig> full length tps genes in its current annotation . hence, the poplar tps gene family is comparable in size with the tps gene families in arabidopsis   <cit> , rice   <cit> , sorghum   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> . in contrast, the genomes of grape , white spruce  and s. moellendorfii contain larger tps gene families with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative functional tps genes, respectively  <cit> . the tps gene family in apple, however, is made up of only  <dig> putative functional tps genes  <cit> . the majority of the poplar tpss was found to cluster within the tps-a and tps-b subfamilies . these clades generally contain tps involved in sesquiterpene formation or in monoterpene formation, respectively  <cit> . in arabidopsis multiple gene duplication events occurred within the tps-a/b gene subfamilies  <cit> . the existence of multiple copies of tps-a/b genes in poplar suggests a similar mechanism of gene duplication in this species. the high number of tps-a/b genes stands in contrast to the two genes found in each of the poplar tps-c and tps-e subfamilies. these subfamilies commonly contain copalyl diphosphate synthases  and kaurene/kaurene-like synthases , respectively, which can be involved in plant secondary as well as primary metabolism. smaller tps-c and tps-e subfamilies were also described for conifer  <cit>  and grape  <cit>  and arabidopsis contains only a single cds and a single ks gene  <cit> .

pttps <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may contribute to herbivore-induced volatile formation
the monoterpene synthase pttps <dig> was shown to produce -β-ocimene, one of the most abundant compounds in the herbivore-induced volatile blend of poplar. upon herbivory, a significant increase in pttps <dig> transcript accumulation could be observed, suggesting a role of pttps <dig> in herbivore-induced -β-ocimene formation in planta . -β-ocimene can be produced by a large number of plant species in floral scent  <cit> , as a herbivore-induced volatile of leaves, e.g. tobacco , corn , cotton  and arabidopsis plants  <cit> , and also as part of essential oils, e.g. chamomile   <cit> . when added to the spider mite-induced volatile blend of wishbone flower , -β-ocimene was able to enhance the blend’s ability to attract predatory mites  <cit> . in contrast, a repellent effect of -β-ocimene was observed for another herbivore enemy, glyptapanteles liparidis, a parasitoid of the gypsy moth larvae  <cit> . besides its effect on insects, -β-ocimene can also function in plant-plant communication by mediating the induction of defense related genes  <cit> . thus the -β-ocimene synthase pttps <dig> might play different roles in direct or indirect defense of poplar.

linalool, another prominent constituent of the poplar volatile bouquet, can be produced by pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  <cit>  . while pttps <dig> formed exclusively --linalool, pttps <dig> produced a racemic linalool mixture . as poplar emits --linalool as well as --linalool  <cit> , both enzymes may contribute to linalool formation in the tree. the upregulation of pttps <dig> transcripts additionally supports the function of pttps <dig> in herbivore-induced volatile biosynthesis . interestingly, pttps <dig> possessed also sesquiterpene synthase activity in vitro and formed a complex mixture of sesquiterpenes . however, a transit peptide at the n-terminus of pttps <dig> suggests a plastidal localization and thus an in vivo function as monoterpene synthase in accordance with the absence of pttps <dig> sesquiterpene products in the poplar volatile blend.

pttps <dig> was shown to encode a nerolidol synthase . this tps clusters within the tps-g family together with pttps <dig>   <cit> . both terpene synthases are characterized by the absence of the rr8w-motif, which is a typical feature of members of the tps-g clade  <cit> . pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> produce --nerolidol in vitro, the enantiomer also present in the poplar scent   <cit> . in contrast to pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> does not have a transit peptide and is therefore more likely responsible for --nerolidol biosynthesis in planta. nerolidol has been shown to be converted into the homoterpene dmnt which is considered to play an important role in plant defense  <cit> . danner and coworkers  already speculated about the involvement of the --nerolidol-producing pttps <dig> in herbivore-induced dmnt biosynthesis. as the expression of pttps <dig> was only slightly induced after herbivore attack, the existence of another nerolidol synthase was predicted. since transcript accumulation of pttps <dig> was strongly upregulated after herbivore damage, it is likely that pttps <dig> contributes to the production of the precursor for dmnt biosynthesis in planta . tmtt is another homoterpene emitted by p. trichocarpa. the precursor of tmtt, geranyllinalool, was produced by the diterpene synthase pttps <dig> . the transcript level of pttps <dig> increased after herbivore damage which corresponded to the induced emission of tmtt . both dmnt and tmtt are described to be emitted from several plants including maize, lima bean, arabidopsis and tomato  <cit>  and a role of tmtt and dmnt in, for example, predatory mite attraction in tomato and arabidopsis, respectively, has been demonstrated  <cit> .

the volatile -β-caryophyllene has been reported to attract enemies of both above- and below-ground maize herbivores  <cit> . in our study, -β-caryophyllene emission was not significantly increased after herbivore damage but showed a trend to higher emission from damaged leaves corresponding to a small increase in -β-caryophyllene synthase  transcripts . however, danner and coworkers  described -β-caryophyllene as an herbivore-inducible poplar volatile. plant age, greenhouse conditions and previous infections could have led to already increased levels of -β-caryophyllene in plants used for the present study.

 <dig> -cineole, the main product of pttps <dig>  was only present in trace amounts in the herbivore-induced volatile blend of p. trichocarpa . a low transcript abundance  is likely to be the reason for this low emission . the in vitro products of pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  could not be detected in the herbivore-induced poplar volatile blend, although qrt-pcr analysis revealed a transcriptional upregulation in herbivore-damaged leaves in comparison to undamaged control leaves . low transcript abundance , but also high km values for fpp or low turnover numbers or lifetimes for the respective proteins could explain the lack of the respective in vitro products of the enzymes in the poplar volatile blend. or, the products could be further converted into non-volatile metabolites, such as sesquiterpene phytoalexins. there are reports of sesquiterpene synthases involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis  <cit> . in maize, for example, the existence of an herbivore-inducible β-macrocarpene synthase and the absence of this sesquiterpene in the volatile blend led to the discovery of β-macrocarpene-derived phytoalexins  <cit> . germacrene a, the major in vitro product of pttps <dig>  was shown to be the precursor for sesquiterpene lactones in various plants like chicory  and pyrethrum   <cit> . hence, we propose that sesquiterpene alcohols produced by pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> and germacrene a produced by pttps <dig> are further metabolized in poplar.

altogether, out of the  <dig> putative tps encoded in the poplar genome,  <dig> tps enzymes could be functionally characterized in this study. including the  <dig> previously published mono- and sesquiterpene synthases, the germacrene d synthase pttps <dig>  the -α-farnesene synthase pttps <dig>  and the linalool/nerolidol synthases pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  <cit>  as well as the isoprene synthase  <cit> , about half of the tps genes present in the genome have now been characterized and their enzymatic function in vitro determined. nearly all of the terpenes emitted by poplar after herbivory can be explained by the enzyme activities of the  <dig> so far characterized mono-, sesqui- and diterpene synthases . nevertheless it is possible that additional tps genes are expressed in other organs of p. trichocarpa as it was already described for other plants. for example, tps genes specifically expressed in flowers or roots were described for chamomile and arabidopsis  <cit> .

herbivore-induced terpene emission in p. trichocarpa is restricted to the damaged leaf and likely mediated by jasmonates
a comparison of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the volatile blends released locally from herbivore-damaged leaves and systemically from undamaged adjacent leaves has been described for p. nigra and hybrid poplar   <cit> . in both studies, a systemic volatile induction in the undamaged leaves above the site of herbivore-damage was reported. on the contrary, we showed that no systemic induction of volatiles was occurring at the level of an individual leaf in p. trichocarpa . as already observed in maize  <cit> , volatile emission was restricted to the damaged leaf. this specific local volatile emission could be important in intra-plant signaling and provides a reliable short-range signal for parasitoids searching for their hosts.

jasmonic acid and their amino acid conjugates are well known as mediators of herbivore-induced plant defenses, including the emission of volatiles in many plant species  <cit> . in a recent publication, clavijo mccormick and coworkers  demonstrated that jasmonates were upregulated after herbivory in black poplar. moreover, exogenous application of ja to p. nigra and p. trichocarpa leaves resulted in increased volatile emission  <cit>   and a transcriptome analysis of p. trichocarpa x deltoides leaves treated with forest tent caterpillars  revealed an upregulation of genes involved in both jasmonate biosynthesis as well as volatile formation  <cit> . the herbivore-induced local terpene emission of p. trichocarpa was also reflected by increased levels of tps transcripts and jasmonates in the damaged leaves in comparison to undamaged adjacent leaves . therefore ja and ja-ile conjugates appear to be major signals for transcriptional regulation of volatile biosynthesis in p. trichocarpa.

although volatile emission of black poplar is inducible by ja application but not by sa application, sa levels are increased after herbivore feeding  <cit> . in our experiments with p. trichocarpa, only herbivory on younger apical leaves resulted in significantly increased sa concentrations in damaged leaves . interestingly, elevated levels of sa were also detected in the vascular-connected leaf   <cit>  beneath the herbivore-damaged leaf . additionally, apical herbivory resulted in increased concentrations of opda and aba in basal leaves . a mobile signal travelling from the apical leaves downward could explain these observations and would provide a reasonable mechanism for the basipetal, systemic defense reactions already described for poplar  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we investigated the terpene synthase gene family in p. trichocarpa and its contribution to herbivore-induced volatile formation. the production of volatile terpenes in poplar is mainly regulated by transcript accumulation of multiple tps genes. the restriction of volatile release to the damaged leaf might play a role in intra-plant signaling and help herbivore enemies to better find their hosts or preys in the tree canopy. while about one third of all poplar tpss seem to be involved in herbivore-induced volatile terpene production, the function of other tps is still unclear. they might play roles in other defense reactions in the different organs of poplar trees.
