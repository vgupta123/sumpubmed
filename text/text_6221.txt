BACKGROUND
recent soybean genetic maps have used combinations of classical and molecular markers to determine the approximate order of sequences on soybean chromosomes viewed as linkage groups  <cit> . the newest versions of the integrated soybean genetic map  <cit>  and physical map  <cit>  provide milestones in soybean genome map development. methods used in creating these map resources have led to the creation of a large number of discrete sequences from bac-ends and marker amplicons. all of these sequences identify either a contig of clustered sequences located in a physical map or a single mapped location in a genetic map. the largest number of soybean sequences available are expressed sequence tags , which were created during public soybean est projects  <cit>  as well as in numerous other soybean research projects. these sequences represent fragments of dna that are expressed as mrna constitutively or during environmental changes. a public repository for all of these sequences is the national center for biotechnology information  <cit> 

although soybean map resources are advanced, they cannot compare to the information available from fully sequenced genomes  <cit> . therefore, comparisons among map and sequence resources of nascent genomes with the elucidated pathways or markers in a. thaliana is an appropriate and informative technique  <cit> . a syntenic relationship between a. thaliana and glycine max l.  based on restriction fragment length polymorphism  marker order has previously been established  <cit> . additional soybean sequence resources have become available  <cit> , and a draft genome is promised, making large-scale sequence-based comparisons with a. thaliana possible and timely.

est resources can be used for genome to genome comparisons. for example, a comparison of soybean ests with those from corn, rice, sorghum, barley, potato, tomato and medicago truncatula  <cit>  focused on evolutionary distance and synteny between ests. in addition, soybean ests have been compared with lupin  and a. thaliana  <cit> , detailing gene structure and expression. molecular markers have been developed for soybean using comparison with the closely related lotus japonicus genome  <cit> . the a. thaliana diacylglycerol acyltransferase  gene sequence was used to identify putative g. soja and g. max est sequences  <cit> . additional comparative genomics resources are available at the legume information system  website  <cit> , but do not show the placement of soybean sequences en-masse against a. thaliana genomic sequence.

synteny between genomes shown by common molecular marker order suggest common genome structures.  <cit> . comparisons among tracts of sequence show precise sequence synteny  <cit> . orthologous and paralogous relationships between small regions of soybean, medicago truncatula and a. thaliana has been reported  <cit> . finally, comparisons of changes within and between sequences are evidence of evolutionary change and selective gene loss  <cit> .

the first objective of this research was to develop a program for large scale dna sequence comparisons, utilizing large tracts of well described genomic dna  as a framework to align thousands of short soybean sequences. the second objective was to present these comparison results in an informative form. in this report we describe the development and operation of programs designed to compare genomic sequence with smaller fragments and the creation of genome-wide illustrations of sequence synteny.

RESULTS
short soybean sequences compared with a. thaliana
the importance, variety and number of short soybean sequences and the availability of well described a. thaliana genomic sequence were the primary factors involved in selection for this test. on average, the program compared over  <dig> tbp/hr  ×  <dig> mbp of arabidopsis dna) =  <dig>  tbp/hr). a total of  <dig>  short soybean sequence matches with a. thaliana were reported from  <dig>  unique records . of these matches, a total of  <dig>  soybean ests ,  <dig>  bes,  <dig> microsatellite,  <dig> fis sequences, and  <dig> gmclone associations were reported. this association of genes and sequences between soybean and a. thaliana can serve several functions, including identification of gene-clusters within soybean, identification of potentially syntenic chromosomal regions, soybean expression estimation and single nucleotide polymorphism detection within soybean sequences.

theoretically, a random  <dig> base pair match should occur every  <dig> bbp. previous work  and the fact that the dna sequence tested was primarily not random  led to the multiple, local  <dig> bp match requirement. each  <dig> bp  match was found within a  <dig> base pair region, and empirical analysis was used to determine that six of these additional matches were a practical minimum. in order to test the accuracy of the soybean vs a. thaliana matches, e-scores for  <dig> randomly distributed matches from each a. thaliana chromosome were generated by using ncbi's blast  <dig> sequences  utility. as figure  <dig> illustrates, increasing the number of additional  <dig> bp hits does increase the average e-score when comparing sequences from these two genomes. the number of additional  <dig> bp hits can be used post-processing, allowing the user to investigate the parameters required for acceptable similarity while only running the program once.

the five separate chromosomes of a. thaliana were put into mapchart  <cit>  format for presentation. reported matches to each chromosome are presented in color, linear order maps . genic regions reported for a. thaliana  are identified by dark  segments and light  descriptive text. soybean est and bes sequences are both in black text, with soybean markers presented in red.

comparison with previously reported soybean-a. thaliana synteny
as previously noted, marker synteny between a. thaliana chromosome i and soybean linkage group a <dig> ; and iv and a <dig>  has been reported  <cit> . the inclusion of rflp and simple sequence repeat  amplicon data from soybean allows limited comparison with this previous work. although sequences from ssr amplicons did match to a. thaliana dna sequence using this procedure, ssr sequences by definition contain repeats and usually yielded non-significant results when tested by the bl2seq utility  <cit> . when ssr containing bacs were analyzed , significance was similar to ssr amplicons, i.e. limited. although both of these data types are included in the map, they were not as reliable as est-based matches. it must also be noted that gene order between a. thaliana and soybean is not inferred by this research, only gene content.

an illustration of the effects of sequence size and comparison power was found in the comparison of the satt <dig> amplicon  with a. thaliana chromosome i . the program reported a  match at base pair  <dig> . a comparison of the entire a. thaliana chromosome i  and this sequence  yielded no significant similarity. however, using a  <dig> bp window of ati dna  yielded an expect value of  <dig> . decreasing the a. thaliana dna window to  <dig> – <dig>  bp yielded a  <dig>  significance level. finally, reducing the sequence to  <dig> – <dig>  yields a  <dig>  result. although previous analysis  <cit>  was performed using tblastx, this type of analysis yielded no significant results for any of the above marker sequence comparisons.

comparing the soybean gi sequences displayed in figure 3b with the reported a. thaliana chromosome v region  yields four linear order groups. the first group, gi15200550– <dig>  was similar to a. thaliana chromosome v , e-values between the soybean sequences are  <dig> . the second group, gi10237097– <dig>  was similar to chromosome v , e-values between the soybean sequences are e- <dig> –  <dig> . the third group, gi16347707– <dig>  was similar to chromosome v , e-values between the soybean sequences are e- <dig> –  <dig> . the fourth sequence, gi <dig>  was similar to chromosome v at e- <dig>  the identification and clustering of similar soybean sequences based on their position on a. thaliana dna was a result of this technique. soybean sequences that grouped together frequently had bl2seq scores of  <dig> , with values rarely above e- <dig>  the ability to detect snps within these grouped soybean sequences is illustrated in figure 3c.

critical program parameters
the ability to start each check at an initial  <dig> bp identity increases processing speed by nearly 1000×. a short sequence advance value determines whether each  <dig> base pair fragment is advanced by one, two, or more bases for each screen of the model  dna sequence, with the potential of increasing the speed by reducing the number of sequence screens.

although all soybean sequences were sequentially placed in relation to the a. thaliana genome, a limitation on map precision means that separation into uniquely delimited map entries does not occur within a  <dig> bp range. for example, in figure 3b, a unique callout containing gi #s  <dig> thru  <dig> is presented. a gap of  <dig> bp existed between gi <dig>  and gi <dig> . in addition, a gap of  <dig> bp between gi <dig>  and gi <dig>  also exists. these gaps may represent weaker than typical links between grouped soybean records .

CONCLUSIONS
we report an alternative technique for large scale dna sequence comparison and the creation of an a. thaliana-based map of soybean ests, bac-end and molecular marker sequences. this map is comprised of  <dig> highly detailed, fully scalable, color-coded sub-maps. these maps allow the rapid, visual identification of clusters of both high and low quantities of transcribed soybean ests and their relation to a. thaliana genomic sequence. to our knowledge, no similar tool exists.

the applications of this processing technique and resulting map appear to be broad. as previously indicated, est-based comparisons between soybean and disparate genomes have been used to explore evolutionary distance and synteny  <cit> . the process presented herein utilizes small fragments of dna and allows users to increase or decrease the similarity required for whole genome comparisons. the flexibility of smaller fragment comparisons allows the creation of highly rigorous comparative maps or less stringent, theoretical maps from diverse sources. most importantly, these maps can be created from thousands of discrete sequences with little a priori knowledge of genome composition. indeed, a model genome can be used to cluster sequences from any source, straight from downloaded fasta formatted files.

a limitation when utilizing a model legume and comparative mapping for soybean marker development was reported by hwang et al  <cit> . this limitation relates to the multi-copy nature of many genes in soybean and the difficulty of separating these homeologous genes in the est dataset. mapping these genes can be difficult when homeologous sequence confounds pcr-based allele identification. the identification of sequence differences between homeologous genes from the same variety may in fact be the only way to specifically map homeologous genes to the correct linkage group of soybean. the clustering of soybean ests shown on the map presented offers unique visual clues as to copy number and expression characteristics of each gene, both within and between soybean varieties.

previously created comparative maps between soybean and a. thaliana relate only a handful of ests or rflps between the two genomes at cm-sized intervals  <cit> . because our map is based on the entirety of the a. thaliana genome, it identifies not only regions reported as syntenic, but regions that are potentially syntenic, in addition, our map exhibits previously unreported detail, reporting differences as low as  <dig> bp. the combination of previously reported synteny between a. thaliana and soybean and the detail of this map combine to make this map a powerful exploratory tool.

the variable nature of output from this processing has clear implications for genetic and physical map construction and annotation of either large fragments of dna or thousands of smaller fragments such as ests and bac-end sequences. this technique reports significant matches when performing comparisons between small fragments of dna and large genomic tracts which is an advantage over tblastn-based analysis. this technique and the programs presented readily allow sequence comparisons across genera. finally, the programs required to perform this analysis require limited computing resources, specifically a computer capable of running java programs and a minimum of  <dig> gb of memory. all java code and map files are available for download at two websites  <cit> .
