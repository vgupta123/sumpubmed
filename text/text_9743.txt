BACKGROUND
the activation, duration and subsequent inactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  signaling pathway triggers the induction of appropriate changes required for the determination of cell fate. although many growth factors show remarkably similar profiles in terms of immediate early gene  mrna expression in various cell lines  <cit> , the biological outcome in response to these factors can vary. in fibroblasts, sustained erk activation induced by platelet derived growth factor  results in s-phase entry, unlike the case following transient activation by epidermal growth factor   <cit> . c-fos is a representative ieg which is expressed within minutes following stimulation with growth factor independent from duration of the upstream signals. however, the protein expression level of c-fos is post-transcriptionally regulated by erk activation kinetics, where transient erk signals induced by egf resulted in little induction of c-fos, whereas sustained erk activation by pdgf induced markedly higher amounts of the same protein  <cit> . thus, the ieg product c-fos can act as a molecular sensor for upstream erk signals that leads cells towards particular paths such as proliferation, transformation or differentiation  <cit> .

c-fos is a member of the activator protein  <dig>  transcription factor group that consist of fos family proteins   <cit>  and jun family proteins   <cit> . the ap- <dig> complex is formed by homo- and heterodimerization of jun, fos and several creb/atf family transcription factors, and mediates a wide range of biological effects related to cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation. c-fos possesses the fxfp consensus motif, an erk binding site, referred to as a def domain, which plays an important role as a sensor for erk activity in cell fate decision  <cit> . in nih 3t <dig> cells, mutation of the c-fos def domain significantly reduced ap- <dig> activity and inhibited the transforming activity associated with wild-type c-fos  <cit> , suggesting that ap- <dig> transcription factor contains a def domain like c-fos and that sustained erk signals largely contribute to the regulation of cellular phenotypes.

we previously described that heregulin  induced sustained signal activity in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells which triggered an irreversible cell phenotype change to differentiation , while egf could only elicit transient signal activity and cell proliferation  <cit> . notwithstanding differences in phenotype induction, egf and hrg induced qualitatively similar early transcription profiles independent of the presence or absence of prolonged erk signal activity, resulted in all-or-none induction of c-fos protein  <cit> . therefore, we assumed that the induction of different cell fates would eventually be accompanied by differences in the later transcribed genes after appearance of c-fos. ultimately, early quantitative differences in gene expression might be followed by qualitative differences during a series of transcriptional events. therefore, in the current study we set out to identify phenotype-specific genes following long-term exposure to growth factors using time-course large-scale gene expression and to validate the function of the targeted genes. expression analysis was first analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr  aimed at identifying core regulatory transcription factors. the results showed that ligand-specific transcription factors showing distinct expression are all induced by hrg but not by egf.

experimental validation was performed in an effort to confirm the late-transcriptional regulation of those transcription factors, c-fos, fra- <dig> and fhl <dig>  our results suggested that a time-dependent transcriptional regulatory network and associated control of the upstream signal activity by transcriptional feedback facilitate the entry of cells into an irreversible state.

methods
cell culture
the mcf- <dig> cell line was maintained in dmem medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. prior to growth factor treatment, cells were serum-starved for 16- <dig> hours, and then either egf  or hrg-β 176- <dig>  was added. cells were incubated with growth factor for the indicated time-period, washed three times with phosphate buffered saline , and lysed with bio-plex lysis buffer .

qrt-pcr for screening of phenotype-specific transcriptional factors
for the qrt-pcr of  <dig>  human transcription factors, we prepared gene-specific pcr primers based on identified mouse transcription factors as previously described  <cit> . pcr amplification was performed in triplicate using an abi prism  <dig> ht instrument . the tailor-made reaction  on the 384-well plates included  <dig>  units of hotstar taq dna polymerase  and associated × <dig> amplification buffer,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> μm dntps, 1/ <dig>  <dig> sybr green i , 7% dmso,  <dig> % rox reference dye ,  <dig> nm of each primer, and  <dig> μl of 40-fold diluted first-stranded cdna synthesis reaction mixture. the polymerase activation step at 95°c for  <dig> min was followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec at 94°c,  <dig> sec at 60°c, and  <dig> sec at 72°c. dissociation curve analysis, which evaluates each pcr product to be amplified from single cdna, was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. several pcr products were also checked by agarose gel electrophoresis . for the qrt-pcr data analysis, differentially expressed genes in response to egf and hrg stimulation were searched for by calculating the index i, defined as follows;  

where xt, egf and xt, hrg represent qrt-pcr-based expression levels of gene x after t hours administration of egf and hrg, respectively. those genes which displayed maximum expression levels of less than  <dig> were omitted prior to the index value calculation. the distribution of i was approximated by a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation values of - <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. those genes with i values greater than  <dig>  were extracted as differentially expressed genes and their expression pattern was confirmed by genechip-based expression data analysis.

microarray analysis
total rna was isolated using trizol reagent  and then purified using the qiagen rneasy mini kit. rna quality was assessed using a bioanalyzer . first- and second-strand cdna synthesis, biotin-labeled crna synthesis, fragmentation of crna and hybridization reactions were performed using a one cycle cdna synthesis kit . genechip  experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. scanned images were processed using genechip operating software  to determine the signal intensity of probe sets. scaling was performed using the single-array expression analysis function in gcos and the target value was set to  <dig>  microarray data used in this study was submitted to gene expression omnibus database .

enrichment analysis
for each of the four transcription factors selected from the qrt-pcr results and confirmed by the microarray data, genes showing an hrg-induced expression pattern were correlated with these transcription factors  and those that showed higher expression with hrg than with egf  were extracted. as a result,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> probe sets were selected for egr <dig>  fosl- <dig>  fhl <dig> and dipa, respectively. the index value i was calculated for the microarray gene expression profile in the same way as for the qrt-pcr data. i =  <dig>  corresponds to 95% point of fitted normal distribution. probe set ids were converted to entrez gene ids according to the manufacturer's annotation and then corresponding gene ontology  terms were extracted from the id mapping table provided by ncbi. those probe sets without gene id were discarded in the analysis. enrichment analysis was performed by fisher's exact test followed by bonferonni's correction. those go terms which showed a small p-value  were regarded as enriched.

qrt-pcr for gene expression validation
for the qrt-pcr of sirna-transfected cells,  <dig> ng of total rna was reverse transcribed using the primescript rt reagent kit . cdna equivalent to  <dig> ng of total rna was used for all the pcr reactions. the sequences of the primers are as follows; 5'-gca ccg tca agg ctg aga ac-3' and 5'-atg gtg gtg aag acg cca gt-3' for gapdh, 5'-act tga aag cat cca tgt gtg tgg ac and 5'-ggc ctg gct caa cat gct act aa-3' for c-fos, 5'-agc agc agc agg tga ttg ga-3' and 5'-cgc aga tca gct cat cac aga ag-3' for fosl- <dig>  5'-tgg cat aac gac tgc ttt aac tgt a-3' and 5'-gtg tga gat cac aag cag caa-3' for fhl <dig>  all pcr reactions were performed using sybr premix ex taq  or kapa sybr fast kit  in the thermal cycler dice real time system tp <dig> . qrt-pcr was performed in triplicate for each sample using default two-step amplification procedures in a  <dig> μl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. the conditions for the pcr reaction were as follows: 60°c for  <dig> sec, 95°c for  <dig> sec, followed by a maximum of  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec, and 60°c for  <dig> sec. the standard curve method was used to determine relative quantification of mrna abundance  <cit> . for normalization of the qrt-pcr data, gapdh expression was used as the control at each time point.

immunoblotting
cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a protein assay reagent . protein phosphorylation levels and total proteins were analyzed by western blotting as previously described  <cit>  using the requisite antibodies. for the western blot analysis, anti-erk , anti-phospho-erk , and anti-alpha-tubulin antibodies were purchased from cell signaling technology, inc. . anti-fos, anti-fra- <dig> and anti-egr <dig> antibodies were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology, inc. , anti-fhl <dig> antibody from aviva system biology  or santa cruz biotechnology, and anti-c-jun antibody from upstate . protein band intensities were quantified using a densitometer .

for the detection of phosphorylated-erk, cells were treated with  <dig> nm egf or hrg at each indicated time point. protein lysates were prepared using the cell lysis kit . the presence of phospho-erk1/ <dig> was detected using the bio-plex phospho-protein assay kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol. data from the reaction was acquired and analyzed using the bio-plex suspension array system . total proteins for erk were measured using the bio-plex total protein assay kit .

gene silencing with rnai
for 60-mm-diameter experiments, mcf- <dig> cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/well using hiperfect transfection reagent  and combimag magnetofection reagents  according to manufacturer's protocol. for c-fos sirna transfection,  <dig> nm sigenome smartpool c-fos sirna or non-targeting control sirna  was included in the transfection mixture. for fosl- <dig> and fhl <dig> sirna transfection, sirna was designed based on sequences specific for human cdna; 5'-gca tca aca cca tga gtg g-3' for fosl- <dig> and 5'-gca agg act tgt cct aca a-3' for fhl <dig>  antisense and sense sirna oligonucleotides with dtdt 3' overhangs were synthesized by takara bio inc. each sirna was added to  <dig> nm and compared with controls transfected using identical concentrations of control sirna mixture. after  <dig> hrs of transfection, cells were starved for  <dig> hrs in serum-free dmem. cells were stimulated with  <dig> nm hrg for the indicated times in the figures, harvested and then lysed in preparation for qrt-pcr and immunoblotting.

protein-protein interaction assay
cells were washed with pbs and lysed in the lysis buffer. the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation. for immunoprecipitation,  <dig>  mg of the aforementioned supernatant protein was incubated with  <dig> μg of antibody and rotated overnight for 4°c. then,  <dig> μl of protein g plus/protein a-agarose suspension  was added and the mix incubated for  <dig> hrs at 4°c on a rotating platform. following centrifugation, beads were washed three times with hntg buffer ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm naf,  <dig> mm na3vo <dig>   <dig>  μg/ml leupeptin,  <dig> μg/ml pepstatin a and  <dig>  mm pmsf). bound proteins were eluted with sds sample buffer, resolved by sds-page, and transferred onto pvdf membranes.

electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
nuclear protein was extracted from ligand-treated mcf- <dig> cells. all procedures were carried out on ice. treated cells were harvested, suspended in a five-fold of ch buffer ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm egta,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm dtt,  <dig> mm naf,  <dig>  mm na3vo <dig>  and  <dig>  mm pmsf added just before use), incubated on ice for  <dig> min and then centrifuged. precipitates were resuspended in a three-fold volume of ch buffer containing  <dig> % np- <dig> and then homogenized using a dounce homogenizer . homogenates were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min at 4°c. to the supernatants was added  <dig> ml of cr buffer ,  <dig>  m kcl,  <dig> mm dtt, 10%  glycerol,  <dig>  mm pmsf and  <dig> %  aprotinin) and  <dig> m nacl was added to a final concentration of  <dig> mm. mixtures were incubated on ice for  <dig> min, centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min, and aliquots were frozen and stored at -80°c until use.

a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate  response element  binding site was synthesized with the following sequence; 5'-ctc tgg cag gtg cgt cag tcc g -3' for -318tre  <cit> . synthesized oligonucleotides were end-labeled with atp  and cleaned up using a gel shift assay system  according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly,  <dig> μg of nuclear extract was incubated in gel shift binding buffer containing 32p-labeled oligopeptides. for the supershift assay, the reaction mixture contained  <dig> μl of anti-fhl <dig> specific antibody. for the oligonucleotide competition experiments, the reaction mixture was preincubated with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide probes prior to the addition of radioactive probes. samples were resolved on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed by radioautography .

RESULTS
we previously showed that stimulation of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells with egf and hrg resulted in very similar early transcription profiles up to  <dig> min, however subsequent cellular phenotypes differed  <cit> . although both ligands evoked qualitatively similar signaling activities and early transcription, hrg induced prolonged signaling activities and significant expression of c-fos protein, while egf induced a transient signal and negligible amounts of c-fos. therefore, it was hypothesized that this all-or-none supply of c-fos transcription factor, which plays a major role in ap- <dig> activation  <cit> , might trigger changes in late transcription which determine ligand-specific cell fate. in an effort to investigate this hypothesis, mcf- <dig> cells were exposed to growth factors for longer time periods and the temporal expression of transcription factors was monitored.

hrg and egf induced different transcription factors
expression analysis of  <dig>  human transcription factors following up to  <dig> hrs  exposure to hrg or egf was performed using qrt-pcr and the expression profiles were investigated. the i value, a ratio representing the difference between hrg- and egf-induced gene expression, was calculated as described in the materials and methods section. fig. 1a shows the distribution of i values for the transcription factors targeted. the results revealed that hrg, unlike the case with egf, uniquely induced significantly high expression levels of five transcription factors  , which were identified as supt4h <dig>  egr <dig>  fosl- <dig>  fhl <dig> and dipa  . surprisingly, neither egf-specific nor significant egf-induced expression of transcription factors was detected.

*fosl- <dig> is the gene name of fra- <dig> protein.

having identified hrg-induced expression of specific transcription factors from the qrt-pcr results, gene expression analysis using microarray was performed in an effort to determine the time-course expression profile of the aforementioned five transcription factors and other genes up to  <dig> hrs . although results of the investigation of supt4h <dig> mrna expression using a microarray platform were inconsistent with the results obtained from the qrt-pcr analysis , results pertaining to the other four transcription factors  showed good agreement with the qrt-pcr data, and time-dependent mrna expression was only observed for hrg-stimulated cells . interestingly, the expression peaks of these four transcription factors appeared one after the other following the expression of c-fos . the gene expression data from both the microarray and qrt-pcr analysis showed that hrg could induce relatively higher expression levels of the c-fos gene compared with egf , and that the ligand-induced differences in expression became more pronounced during the later expression of egr <dig>  fosl- <dig>  fhl <dig> and dipa . transient c-fos expression might suggest negative regulation by other transcription factors. furthermore, the data implies that c-fos might be replaced in the ap- <dig> complex by another ap- <dig> member, thereby altering a function of ap- <dig>  <cit>  to facilitate response to hrg-mediated cell fate.

the product of the first inducible gene, egr <dig>  is a zinc-finger protein, a member of the egr family of transcription regulatory factors which plays a critical role in mediating enduring forms of neuronal plasticity and the regulation of inflammatory cytokine gene transcription  <cit> . egr <dig> and egr <dig> interact with nfκb p <dig> and p <dig> to activate transcription inflammatory-gene promoters  <cit> . fra- <dig>  is a member of the ap- <dig> family of transcription factors that includes c-fos, and plays an important role in cell motility, invasion, and maintenance and progression in several transformed and neoplastic cells  <cit> . fra- <dig> is known to contribute to cellular differentiation processes through interactions with c-fos  <cit>  and requires signal-dependent protein stabilization through the def domain  in a manner similar to c-fos  <cit> . fhl <dig> can serve as a transcriptional coactivator of ap- <dig>  androgen receptor, creb and crem in transformed cells and is known to associate with jun and fos  <cit> . interestingly, fhl <dig> has been reported to bind to phosphorylated erk in vitro and inhibit nuclear localization and activity of erk in stimulated cardiomyocytes, indicating its antagonistic role in cellular signaling  <cit> . dipa is known as a partner of c/ebp β and was reported to have an inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes  <cit> .

we also identified genes  the expression patterns of which correlated with the aforementioned candidate four transcription factors, and which showed higher expression following hrg stimulation compared with egf, as determined from our microarray data . enriched transcription factors associated with the  <dig> probe sets which correspond to  <dig> genes were searched for using gather  <cit> . as a result, ap- <dig>  sp <dig> and srf were identified as enriched transcription factors, suggesting that these transcription factors are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the correlated genes. enrichment analysis using gene ontology  <cit>  for each correlated gene cluster revealed time-dependent activation of gene function and pathways specifically activated by hrg . in the early phase, genes related to transcriptional regulation and the maintenance of signal transduction were activated, and then the expression diminished in the later phase. in the mid to late phase, genes related to development and differentiation were activated. manual curation of the gene list and clustering results revealed that the expression pattern of dipa was significantly correlated with the expression of fabp <dig> , a differentiation marker of adipocytes  <cit>  . furthermore, the expression of fabp <dig> was correlated with the expression of lipid regulators such as fatty acid desaturase  <dig> and metastasis markers such as matrix-metallopeptidase  <dig>  only in hrg-stimulated cells. these data indicate that cells are directed towards differentiation and/or transformation of mcf- <dig> cells during the late phase following hrg stimulation. thus, the appearance of expression peaks associated with these transcription factors showed a physiologically meaningful sequential profile .

although dipa contains a basic region-leucine zipper dna binding and dimerization domain, which has similarities to fra family members  <cit> , dipa has never been reported to interact with the ap- <dig> complex, egr <dig> or fhl <dig>  moreover, several of our preliminary experiments failed to show an interaction of dipa with any of the ap- <dig> proteins . therefore, we decided to focus on validating the mutual regulation of the other three transcription factors  together with c-fos.

hrg induced time-dependent expression of c-fos but not of egr4
in an effort to confirm the effects of hrg on egr <dig> protein expression, a time-course treatment of mcf- <dig> cells with either egf or hrg was performed. egr <dig> protein was expressed at much higher levels in egf-treated cells compared with hrg-treated cells , indicating that protein expression is not coordinated with gene expression in the case of egr <dig>  furthermore, immunoprecipitation studies revealed that egr <dig> clearly failed to interact with c-fos or any other ap- <dig> proteins , while c-jun showed a strong interaction with c-fos . egr <dig> is a zinc-finger protein which binds the specific sequence gcgtgggcg and negatively regulates transcription derived from its own gene promoter  <cit> . neither c-fos nor fosl- <dig> contain the egr4-binding sequence within their promoter regions , suggesting that egr <dig> could not interact with ap- <dig>  a previous study reported that egr <dig> can negatively regulate transcription derived from its own gene promoter whereas egr <dig> can function as an activator  <cit> . egr <dig> plays a role that contrasts that of egr <dig>  and is regulated by both mapk-dependent and -independent pathways in pc12d cells  <cit> , suggesting that egr <dig> could also play a role in transcriptional regulation triggered by other pathways such as those involving pi3k or estrogen receptor signaling which are also active in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . however, based on our data, we concluded that egr <dig> might not participate in the transcriptional regulatory network pertaining to cellular differentiation induced by hrg in mcf- <dig> cells.

fra- <dig> and fhl <dig> are associated with the c-fos ap- <dig> complex
ap- <dig> proteins represent a group of ieg products that play important roles in triggering and regulating late transcription. ieg products which possess a def domain can act as sensors for erk signaling  <cit> . among our candidate transcription factors, fra- <dig> and c-fos possess def domains. in an effort to assay for ap- <dig> activity, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed . the c-fos and c-jun gene expression profiles show good agreement with each other , and c-jun interacted with c-fos immediately following hrg stimulation and then began to dissociate at  <dig> hr . on the other hand, the association between fra- <dig> and c-fos began to increase, and this interaction was maintained for several hours . since c-fos ap- <dig> family proteins cannot exist as homodimers after the dissociation of c-jun at  <dig> hr, the results from figs. 4b and 4d also indicate that fra- <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with c-fos  might associate with other binding partners, such as jun ap- <dig> family proteins or fhl <dig>  in fig. 4d and 4e, fhl <dig> and c-fos, and fra- <dig> and fhl <dig> also showed a similar time-course in terms of complex formation. on the other hand, neither c-fos nor fra- <dig> could co-immunoprecipitate with junb and jund . thus, results of the immunoprecipitation study suggested that c-fos, fra- <dig> and fhl <dig> might regulate the same transcriptional complex following regulation of the complex by c-jun.

the upstream tpa response element   in the promoter region of fosl- <dig> is important for inducing the fosl- <dig> gene. tre is a binding site for c-jun and jund  <cit>  and is also targeted by c-fos and fosb  <cit> , although fosl-1transcription is also co-regulated by the binding of srf, elk <dig>  atf <dig> and creb to the -276/- <dig> region for enhanced induction of fosl- <dig>  <cit> . in an effort to determine whether fhl <dig> can bind to fosl- <dig> dna, emsa using tre oligonucleotides was performed . the mobility of the labeled - <dig> tre probe shifted in the presence of nuclear extract  and was dependent on hrg stimulation. the addition of anti-fhl <dig> antibody to the binding reaction resulted in supershifts, suggesting that fhl <dig> could directly or indirectly bind to tre  on the fosl- <dig> promoter and perhaps regulate the expression together with other ap- <dig> proteins.

rna interference of c-fos suppressed fra- <dig> and fhl <dig> gene and protein expression
if c-fos regulates fra- <dig> and fhl <dig> expression following hrg stimulation, the suppression of c-fos could induce critical changes in late transcriptional control. when c-fos gene expression was effectively suppressed using rnai, fosl- <dig> and fhl <dig> gene expression was also reduced in the presence of hrg . c-fos knockdown also led to the suppression of fra- <dig> protein expression , although fhl <dig> protein expression was not significantly reduced under the same conditions . this indicates that both fra- <dig> and fhl <dig> possibly act downstream to c-fos. on the other hand, fosl <dig> gene knockdown using rnai induced an increase in fhl <dig> gene expression .

fhl <dig> knockdown caused an increase in c-fos mrna expression . this result is consistent with a previous report suggesting that fhl <dig> is a negative regulator of erk  <cit> , therefore erk-regulated c-fos expression is similarly negatively regulated by fhl <dig>  indeed, reduced gene expression of fhl <dig> resulted in the up-regulation of phospho-erk . on the other hand, fosl- <dig> gene knockdown resulted in a slight increase in erk phosphorylation with little effect, which seems to be inconsistent with the result shown in fig.  <dig>  these results may suggest independent negative erk regulation by fosl- <dig> and fhl <dig>  but not only by fosl- <dig>  in fact, the phosphorylation of erk peaked within  <dig> min, was sustained for 1- <dig> hr, and then gradually decreased with the increase in fhl <dig> mrna  and protein expression . these results indicated that both fra- <dig> and fhl <dig> may negatively regulate the upstream signaling.

discussion
in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells, hrg can elicit differentiation while treatment of cells with egf leads to cell proliferation, processes which possess different intensities of signaling and gene regulation that work in a coordinated manner. sustained activation of erk by hrg resulted in stabilization of signaling mediators and changes in the supply of transcription factor proteins possessing an erk sensing domain, thus leading cells along a path of irreversible differentiation  <cit> . indeed, we identified a time-dependent interaction of several transcription factors whose expression levels were significantly elevated by hrg exposure, but not by egf, during the course of a 72-hour time-course treatment of mcf- <dig> cells . these transcription factors  were expressed in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that they might regulate each other.

ap- <dig> consists of dimers of proteins encoded by fos and jun gene families, which have been widely implicated in differentiation, cell proliferation and transformation  <cit> . the fos proteins  form heterodimers with the jun protein families  and regulate gene expression from tre and tre-like elements present within various promoters  <cit> . our immunoprecipitation assay showed that the ap- <dig> complex in hrg-treated mcf- <dig> cells contained c-jun, c-fos and fra- <dig>  although the association of c-jun in the complex is transient , while that of c-fos and fra- <dig> are sustained for up to  <dig> hr . on the other hand, we demonstrated that fhl <dig> could associate with ap- <dig> proteins such as c-fos and fra- <dig>  taken together with those results, late transcriptional regulation in mcf- <dig> cells is mediated by a regulatory complex containing c-fos, fra- <dig> and fhl <dig>  one possible scenario is that after c-jun dissociates from the ap- <dig> complex, fhl <dig> could be a binding partner of c-fos and/or fra- <dig>  in pc <dig> cells, nerve growth factor  induces sustained c-jun and c-fos activity in events leading to neural differentiation  <cit> . in mcf- <dig> cells, the gene expression profiles of c-fos and c-jun  induced by hrg were similar. both expression patterns were transient for the first  <dig>  hrs, and c-jun seemed to dissociate from the complex within  <dig> hrs, even though c-fos and fra- <dig> remained within the complex for a longer period. fra- <dig> gene expression was followed by the expression of two other ap- <dig> genes, c-fos and c-jun , and fra- <dig> protein induction was also prolonged for up to  <dig> hr following hrg stimulation . thus, unlike ngf-induced signaling in pc <dig> cells, hrg treatment of mcf- <dig> cells evokes sustained formation of the ap- <dig> complex through fra- <dig>  but not c-jun. taken together, it seems that c-fos and fra- <dig>  but not c-jun, play an important role in mcf- <dig> cells in terms of late transcriptional processes and the progression of cell differentiation. indeed, several pathological studies in breast cancer and neoplastic breast diseases have described fra- <dig> as a useful marker in breast carcinogenesis, and its overexpression results in malignancy  <cit> .

moron et al. suggested that fhl <dig> may act as a coactivator of the c-fos and c-jun complex by stimulating ap-1-dependent transcription  <cit> . in fact, fhl <dig> was able to associate with the c-fos and fra- <dig> . the emsa supershift experiment  also supported the view that fhl <dig> can bind to the - <dig> tre sequence present within the fosl- <dig> promoter region  <cit> . the - <dig> tre region is important as a c-fos responsive element for inducing enhanced expression of fosl- <dig>  <cit>  and serves as the binding site of ap- <dig> proteins such as c-jun and jund  <cit> . the result indicates that fhl <dig> may regulate the transcription of fosl- <dig> through this region together with other ap- <dig> components. however, further investigations are required to delineate the interaction mechanism and regulation system involving fhl <dig> and ap- <dig> proteins. furthermore, there appear to be conflicting reports concerning the role played by fhl <dig>  where it has been suggested that fhl <dig> can serve as a repressor of mek1-erk1/ <dig> signaling  <cit>  or as an enhancer of the c-fos promoter, whose gene is immediately expressed by activation of erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated using rnai that fhl <dig> knockdown induced clear elevation of c-fos gene expression and erk activation. the gradual reduction in phospho-erk levels was followed by an increase in fhl <dig> expression . these results suggested that fhl <dig> might inhibit both erk activity and erk-dependent transcription. on the other hand, fosl <dig> knockdown induced elevated expression of fhl <dig> , which suggests that fhl <dig> is not a downstream target of fosl <dig> and negatively regulates erk signaling independently from c-fos-fosl <dig> regulation, even though fhl <dig> induction seemed to be influenced by c-fos.

our analysis indicated that a time-dependent transcriptional regulatory network is vital in controlling the upstream erk signaling pathway through a negative feedback loop pertaining to mcf- <dig> cell differentiation. however, there is a possibility that multiple signaling pathways such as those involving pi3k and the estrogen receptor could regulate transcription in and the differentiation of mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> , and other signal-inducible factors could affect and interfere with the transcription factors we have not identified. nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the transcription factors identified in the current analysis showed sequential time-dependent expression and mutual regulation, and that these functions are regulated by upstream erk signals. however, later transcription inhibits the original upstream signal by negative feedback once the signal becomes unnecessary. in general, negative feedback functions to stabilize biological systems and several earlier studies have indicated the presence of negative feedback in cellular differentiation processes  <cit> . our study has indicated that ligand-stimulated signaling activity is not only suppressed within intracellular signaling as demonstrated by egf-induced cbl down-regulation  <cit>  or negative feedback within the mapk cascade in pc <dig> cells  <cit> , but is also regulated through de novo transcription.

CONCLUSIONS
fig.  <dig> depicts the suggested late-transcriptional regulatory network involved in the differentiation of mcf- <dig> cells. in early transcription, sustained erk activation induces ieg expression including c-fos. this def-domain containing protein, c-fos, can be stabilized by the upstream erk signal. this expression is followed by expression of another ap- <dig> family member, fra- <dig>  which then triggers fhl <dig> expression. fra- <dig> protein requires stabilization by erk to function  <cit> , and therefore erk activity is required until such time as fra- <dig> and c-fos proteins are stabilized. the sequential appearance of fhl <dig> can then switch off unnecessary erk activity, which results in complete signal cut-off. the differentiation process in mcf- <dig> cells could therefore be regulated by negative feedback control from the transcriptional network.
