BACKGROUND
we know that various factors can influence and promote regeneration of peripheral axons. in addition to soluble factors , the extracellular environment in which growth occurs is critically important. axonal regeneration does not occur to any great extent in the cns, and while this is due to a number of factors, the most prominent is a non-permissive growth environment as well as an unavailability of appropriate growth-promoting factors. in the pns, on the other hand, peripheral axons  generally regenerate quite well.

growth factors and extracellular matrix  molecules like laminin act through cell surface receptors that activate often convergent signalling pathways to elicit neurite growth in sensory neurons  <cit> . among the targets of these pathways are the cytoskeletal elements responsible for initiating and maintaining the structure of growing processes. actin, tubulin and intermediate filaments all play a part in growth processes  <cit> . there are also a variety of other molecules that interact with these components to modulate or protect the cytoskeleton from deleterious stresses.

one class of molecules known to act as chaperones include the small heat shock protein family, of which heat shock protein  <dig> is a member. hsp <dig>  in addition to its roles in regulating apoptosis and protein folding, interacts with different cytoskeletal elements  <cit> . much of this work has been carried out using non-neural cells, particularly fibroblast and epithelial derived cells. part of its protective role in stressed cells has been attributed to its actions as an actin-capping protein  <cit> . hsp <dig> has been reported to be a component of focal contacts, play an important role in smooth muscle contraction and be important for cellular migration in endothelial cells . rodent hsp <dig> can be phosphorylated on  <dig> sites, ser <dig> and ser  <dig>  although human hsp <dig> has  <dig> serine phosphorylation sites   <cit> . mapkap-k <dig>  via its activation by p <dig> mapk, is reported to be the hsp <dig> kinase, although there are recent reports that pkc α,δ and camp-dependent kinase can also phosphorylate hsp <dig>  <cit> . in terms of its influence on actin, phsp <dig> acts to promote actin polymerization and stress fibre formation. it also has a role in protecting or stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton, although this appears to depend upon the nature of the phsp  <cit> . monomeric and non phospho-hsp <dig> inhibit actin polymerization in vitro, while phosphorylated monomers and non-phosphorylated multimers have no effect on actin polymerization  <cit> .

prior reports and our own observations have suggested a role for hsp <dig> in axonal growth or regeneration, in addition to its role in promoting neuronal survival. hsp <dig> is upregulated after injury in drg neurons in vivo and after dissociation in vitro . other injury models have shown increases in hsp <dig> in schwann cells and white matter columns  <cit>  and it has been speculated that hsp <dig> might be important in the neuronal response to injury and regeneration  <cit> . of direct relevance to a potential role of hsp <dig> in axonal growth are the recent reports indicating that hsp <dig> and the related hsp <dig> gene deletions are responsible for familial peripheral axonopathies  <cit> .

in vitro models have been widely used to study the growth behaviour of neurite initiation and extension in both csn and peripheral neurons. in many models, neurotrophin stimulation is required for neurite growth, although in most of these models neurotrophins are also required for survival. another widely used paradigm involves the stimulation of plated neurons with soluble laminin or extracellular matrix preparations , both of which elicit neurite initiation  <cit> . this approach is particularly useful in mature drg neurons, where not all cells will respond to a given neurotrophin . regardless of how process formation is evoked, there appear to be several general stages that can be identified including the formation of lamellopodia, filopodia, and the eventual emergence of immature neurites with growth cones  <cit> . the cellular mechanisms responsible for these behaviours are not fully elucidated.

in our cultures of adult drg neurons we have observed robust expression and distribution of hsp <dig> in dissociated drg neurons, particularly in neuritic networks and growth cones. these observations, along with the reported role of hsp <dig> in modulating the actin cytoskeleton in other cells types, led us to investigate the potential role of hsp <dig> in interacting with cytoskeletal elements in different stages of neurite initiation and extension. our hypothesis was that hsp <dig> associates with the cytoskeleton in neurons and plays a key role in regulating or fine-tuning the observed ability of the cells to initiate and extend processes in response to the appropriate stimuli.

RESULTS
laminin induces several identifiable stages of neurite initiation and growth
in order to investigate stages of neurite initiation and subsequent growth, we employed a laminin stimulation paradigm. as these neurons are adult, they do not require any added trophic factors for their survival, and therefore neither ngf nor any other neurotrophin was required to initiate growth in these experiments. similar stimulation experiments using laminin or matrigel have been carried out using sympathetic neurons  <cit> .

neurons were dissociated and plated on poly-lysine coated 16-well slides and allowed to adhere overnight . subsequently, the plating medium was removed and  <dig> μl of medium containing soluble laminin  was added to the cells. control wells consisted of mock stimulation . slides were fixed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> min and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs after stimulation and subsequently processed for detection of actin, tubulin and hsp <dig>  various distinctive stages in neuronal membrane expansion and neurite growth were observed and are summarized in figure  <dig>  one of the first steps is the appearance of a membranous expansion either around the whole soma or only from a particular portion of the cell body . these lamellae are positively stained for actin . within 15– <dig> min, small sprouts extend from the lamellae and there are clear examples of focal contacts forming around the periphery of a lamellopodium . at later time points  some of the sprouts have elongated into filopodia and often have small growth cones associated with them . subsequently, neurites form and some are selected for extension by a process that is not well characterized .

hsp <dig> colocalizes with actin and tubulin in the early stages of process initiation
based on our hypothesis that hsp <dig> may play a role in process initiation or neurite growth, we examined the localization of hsp <dig> in neurons in various stages of process formation using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. here, examples of the different stages as defined in the previous section  were selected from cells stimulated with laminin for  <dig> or  <dig> hrs. in addition, because of the association of hsp <dig> with actin and tubulin in non-neuronal cells  <cit> , we also examined whether hsp <dig> would colocalize with actin and/or tubulin in neurons. representative results are presented in figure  <dig>  panels 2a and d show actin  in contact points  located at the periphery of an lamellopodium at one end of the neuron in a and around the circumference of the lamellum of the neuron in d. panels 2b and 2e show the corresponding images for hsp <dig> . the merged images  show that hsp <dig> and actin appear to be colocalized in focal contacts.

in panels g-l, the cells were costained with antibodies for hsp <dig>  and total tubulin . the neuron in figure 2g and 2i is beginning to show progress from the lamellar stage toward the formation of small filopodia . tubulin staining shows some concentration in the cortical area . there is colocalization with hsp <dig> in the cortical area  and filopodia , although there are areas where there is little or no overlap with hsp <dig> staining . the neuron shown in figure 2j and 2l displays a pattern that was seen consistently in several different experiments, with colocalization of tubulin and hsp <dig> at the cortical area  and the emergence of a more discrete process .

phosphorylated hsp <dig> is also localized with actin and tubulin at the early stages of process formation
hsp <dig> can be phosphorylated on  <dig> sites of rat hsp <dig> , and this phosphorylation is reported to be important in the role of hsp <dig> in its interactions with actin  <cit> . using an antibody that recognizes hsp <dig> phosphorylated on the ser <dig> site , we costained neurons at early stages  of process formation for phsp <dig> and actin  and phsp <dig> and tubulin . actin  and phsp <dig>  show overlap in the lamellopodium  and in focal contacts . however, this is not complete, as noted by the exclusion of the phsp <dig> from the leading edge of the lamellopodium . tubulin  and phsp <dig>  also colocalize in focal contacts , emerging filopodia  and in the cortical area .

colocalization of hsp <dig> and cytoskeletal elements in neurites and growth cones at later stages of neurite growth and extension
our initial observations indicated that the majority of adult drg neurons in culture display robust expression of hsp <dig>  not only in the cell bodies but throughout the neurites when present. hsp <dig> expression in sensory neuron cell bodies as well as dendritic and axonal networks has been previously reported for in vivo expression  <cit> . in the present study, we further examined this distribution, particularly in terms of co-expression with actin and tubulin. rather than using the soluble laminin stimulation paradigm employed in the experiments examining early events, in these experiments we plated the neurons directly onto laminin-coated slides and then fixed the cultures  <dig> hrs after plating. we have previously reported that when adult drg neurons are cultured on surfaces coated with diluted growth factor-free matrigel, or laminin, a relatively high percentage of the neurons display significant amount of neurite outgrowth by  <dig> hrs after plating  <cit> .

we also noted that the hsp <dig> and phsp <dig> were strongly expressed in growth cones, further supporting an important role for hsp <dig> not only in neurite initiation but also continued neurite extension. figure  <dig> presents typical growth cones seen in the cultures described above. different types of growth cones were observed with phsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  being present in the core  of more expanded growth cones as well as in the filopodia . the growth cones in figure 5c, f resemble the branch points noted in figure  <dig>  with an accumulation of an hsp <dig> core and filopodia showing both hsp <dig> and tubulin . while the significance of this localization is not entirely clear, it is possible that one role of hsp <dig> is to stabilize the cytoskeleton at these points where branching may occur .

disruption of actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin d results in aberrant neurite growth
hsp <dig> has been suggested to play a key role in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics by acting as an actin-capping protein. in order to understand the role of hsp <dig> in neuritic growth we decided to first examine the effects of disrupting the actin cytoskeleton integrity using cytochalasin d . neurons were plated on laminin-coated slides and cytd was added to the medium  <dig> hrs post-plating . cultures were fixed  <dig> hrs later and examined for changes in neurite growth patterns and expression of hsp <dig> and actin or tubulin.

representative examples of the effects of cytd on neurons are presented in figure  <dig>  there was no discernible distinction between different sizes of neurons in their response to cytd; small, medium and large sized neurons displayed atypical process formation. compared to the usual patterns of neuritic growth , neurons treated with cytd showed aberrant growth  including multiple processes emerging from the cell body , as well as stunted and disoriented neurites . in the cell displayed in figure 6a, c, the processes show accumulation of actin  and phsp <dig>  in their tips . another example  shows several neurites that appear to have a disorganized internal structure resulting in the lack of the normal radial neurite extension and branching . in these examples, we used an antibody against actin, rather than phalloidin, in order to see total actin. in the bottom panels of figure  <dig>  two more examples are presented showing tubulin , phsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  and the corresponding merged images . the cytoskeleton is more apparent in these latter examples, where the tubulin  staining is clearly fibrillar in nature . again, the disorganized and looping growth of neurites is apparent . in panels a-f, the actin antibody recognizes total actin, so even though cytd should disrupt the f-actin network, the antibody still detects g-actin.

inhibition of hsp <dig> phosphorylation also results in aberrant neurite growth
because of the reported role of hsp <dig> phosphorylation in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, we wished to determine the effects of inhibiting p <dig> mapk. p <dig> mapk activity leads to the phosphorylation and activation of mapkap-k <dig>  which acts as an hsp <dig> kinase  <cit> . inhibition of p38mapk activity has been used to block phosphorylation of hsp <dig> in the absence of direct inhibitors of mapkap-k <dig>  we have thus used a combination of  <dig> commercially available p <dig> mapk inhibitors  to investigate the potential contribution of phosphorylated hsp <dig> to neurite growth.

we initially determined whether the inhibitors were effective in preventing hsp <dig> phosphorylation. using larger scale cultures, neurons were plated on ln-coated 12-well plates and after  <dig> hrs the inhibitors were added;  <dig> hrs after sb addition, cell lysates were prepared as described in the methods. for these experiments, we used a commercially available protocol to fractionate the cells into cytosolic, membrane, nuclear and cytoskeleton fractions. following electrophoresis, the resulting blots were probed with phsp <dig> s <dig> and total hsp <dig> antibodies. the results of a representative experiment presented in figure  <dig> show that inhibitors do indeed attenuate the phosphorylation of hsp <dig>  the blots also show that hsp <dig> is found in the cytosolic, membrane and cytoskeletal fractions, while the phsp <dig> is associated primarily with the soluble fraction.

having determined that the inhibitors had the expected effects on phsp <dig>  we then plated the neurons on laminin-coated slides as for the previous experiments, and treated the cultures with sb  <dig> hrs after plating, fixed the cells  <dig> hrs later and carried out immunostaining for phsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  actin and tubulin as before.

neurons treated with sb displayed clearly atypical neurite growth. the examples presented are representative of the various patterns of neurite growth observed. as with the cytd treatment, there was no discernible distinction between different sizes of neurons in their response to sb; small, medium and large sized neurons displayed aberrant process formation. in the neuron shown in figure 7a, c, the neurites emerged from the cell body but wrapped around the soma  and appeared unable to undergo appropriate extension. another common observation was the appearance of relatively short but flattened and expanded processes and growth cones. the example in figure 8d, f is stained for tubulin  and hsp <dig> , with the merged image  showing the disorganized nature of the cytoskeletal elements . in this example, note that tubulin does not have complete overlap with hsp <dig> staining, particularly at the tips of the growth cones .

in addition, some neurons displayed extensive neurite growth, although this was again generally characterized by flattened and expanded processes and growth cones. figure  <dig> presents such an example. this neuron has at least 7– <dig> processes extending from the cell body, all of which show process expansion. in panels a-c, hsp <dig>  can clearly be observed colocalized with tubulin  in the processes emerging from the cell body . areas of the fibrillar nature and overlap of hsp <dig> and tubulin are also noted . in figure 9d, f, larger magnification of the area generally noted by the arrowheads in a-c is shown. here the splaying of the growth cones  and loss of cytoskeletal bundling is more apparent .

these results suggest that attenuation of the phosphorylation of hsp <dig> can have adverse effects on the neuritic cytoskeleton, similar to those observed with cyt d. although our assumption  is that the sb compounds block p <dig> mapk activity, its downstream effects on mapkap-k <dig> and the subsequent inhibition of hsp <dig> phosphorylation, it is possible that these compounds may have other inhibitory influences, or that they may be influencing the cytoskeletal elements through actions not involving hsp <dig>  while our data show that the sb compounds do inhibit phosphorylation of hsp <dig>  we cannot completely rule out effects on other signalling components, although at the concentrations we have used, the effects are reported to be specific for p <dig> mapk inhibition, rather than any other additional kinases.

discussion
we describe early events in adult drg neuron process formation in response to stimulation with the extracellular matrix protein laminin. our data show that hsp <dig> appears to associate with actin and tubulin in structures found at all stages of neurite initiation. lamellopodia, filopodia, microspikes and focal contacts all displayed a colocalization of hsp <dig> and actin or tubulin. the filamentous nature of the hsp <dig> was quite clear in neurites and growth cones supporting the hypothesis that hsp <dig> is associating with cytoskeletal elements.

our results are similar to those described previously for neurite growth initiation and process extension in embryonic cultured cns neurons. culture studies of early neuritogenesis events in hippocampal neurons have provided information that demonstrates that events after initial cellular attachment to the substrate are quite similar among different cell types and indeed events in neurons are very similar to those in migratory fibroblasts  <cit> . the cells attach and are surrounded by a thin lamellopodium from which small extensions sprout. these extensions often have growth cones and display dynamic back and forth movements. at some point, one or more of these processes elongates, while the others remain stationary or retract. all the stages described by dasilva and dotti  <cit>  and dehmelt and halpain  <cit>  could be identified in our cultures of adult drg neurons, suggesting that this process is intrinsic to all neurons.

neurite protrusion requires the actin cytoskeleton, with lamellopodia being filled with an actin meshwork necessary for the appropriate adhesion and filopodia having actin bundles with the rapidly growing ends oriented towards the tips. studies have shown that actin polymerizes at the leading edge of the lamellopodia, and then disassembles and recedes from the peripheral area  <cit> . this phenomenon influences growth cone advance and could likely play a role in neurite initiation as well. microtubules may play a mechanical role in this since they invade the actin cytoskeleton in lamellopodia of various cell types.  <cit> .

in cell-free assay systems, hsp <dig> can act as an actin-capping protein which prevents the polymerization of actin and the assembly of f-actin  <cit> . phosphorylation of hsp <dig> leads to the loss of its ability to inhibit actin polymerization, and thus increases the rate and extent of actin polymerization and the formation of f-actin  <cit> . in addition to modulating the actin cytoskeleton, hsp <dig> has also been reported to interact with both neurofilaments and microtubules in a phosphorylation-dependent manner  <cit> . hsp <dig> has been inferred to stabilize not only actin, but also neurofilament and microtubules  <cit> .

phosphorylation of hsp <dig> promotes the polymerization of actin and stress fibre formation  <cit> . hsp <dig> is phosphorylated on  <dig> serines in the human hsp <dig>  and  <dig> in the rodent hsp <dig> . hsp <dig> in unstressed cells exists as large oligomers, while upon phosphorylation hsp <dig> dissociates in smaller species, including dimers and monomers  <cit> . in cell free assays, the unphosphorylated monomers of hsp <dig> blocked actin polymerization, while the unphosphorylated oligomers and the phosphorylated monomeric form were ineffective. while the evidence based primarily on structural studies supports a role for phosphorylation of hsp <dig> in stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton, a recent study has provided direct functional evidence that this is indeed the case  <cit> .

hsp <dig> phosphorylation is regulated by activity of the p38mapk pathway, whereby p <dig> mapk activation of map-kinase-activated protein-kinase 2/ <dig>  leads to the phosphorylation of hsp <dig>  <cit> . however, pkcδ and cgmp-dependent kinase have also been reported to phosphorylate hsp <dig> in smooth muscle  <cit> . while the classical stress-activated signalling pathway activation of p <dig> mapk regulates hsp <dig> after heat-shock and other stresses, it is more likely that activation of p <dig> mapk is downstream of the cdc- <dig> and rac activation of pak <dig> with respect to neurite initiation and growth. for example, laminin can lead to p <dig> mapk activation and hsp <dig> phosphorylation, as previously reported for schwann cells  <cit> , and this is likely via cdc- <dig> and rac activation downstream of integrin-dependent signalling cascades  <cit> . given the role of rac and rho in regulating actin dynamics in growth cones and the observations that inhibition of rho promotes axonal growth on inhibitory substrates  <cit> , the interactions of hsp <dig> with rho observed in smooth muscle cells  <cit>  suggests an intriguing interplay among these components. whether a similar interaction occurs in neurons or axons is not known.

treatment of neurons with agents that disrupt the actin cytoskeleton result in aberrant neurite initiation and growth. neurons treated with cyt d, which caps existing actin filaments at barbed ends, consistently show rapid emergence of numerous neurites that elongate in a disoriented fashion  <cit> . treatment of drg neurons in our cultures resulted in similar aberrant growth, particularly at the early stages examined where numerous projections emerged from the neurons as early as  <dig> hr after laminin stimulation ; neurons examined at  <dig> hrs showed disoriented growth of processes .

since cyt d acts to cap barbed actin filaments and non-phophorylated hsp <dig> has been suggested to do the same, we reasoned that if phsp <dig> was important for normal neurite initiation and extension, if we inhibited the phosphorylation of hsp <dig> we might observe similar effects on neurite initiation. as shown in our results, attenuation of hsp <dig> phosphorylation using the p38mapk inhibitors, does indeed result in atypical growth patterns. at the early stages, results were similar to what we had observed with cyt d , and at later stages, neurite growth was again quite clearly aberrant . some neurons showed neurites that tended to wrap around the cell soma or extend in a disoriented fashion. another consistent characteristic of the relatively short processes that did extend was the flattened and splayed nature of the neurites and growth cones. there appeared to be a lack of the appropriate actin and microtubular bundling that would result in normal neurite extension and growth cone dynamics   <cit> . we have inferred that effects of p <dig> mapk inhibition on neurite growth were due to the inhibition of hsp <dig> phosphorylation. a similar inhibition of neurite initiation by sb has been reported in pc <dig> cells  <cit> ; interestingly, in this study induction of hsp <dig> by heat shock promoted neuritogenesis. however, there may be effects on other cytoskeletal elements. ackerley et al  <cit>  have reported that p <dig> mapk also phosphorylates neurofilaments in transfected cos cells, although they did not find any effect of p <dig> mapk inhibition on neurofilament phosphorylation in cortical neurons.

there are relatively few reports of the interaction of hsp <dig> with cytoskeletal elements other than actin. hsp <dig> has been reported to associate with microtubules in hela cells  <cit>  and in cho cells  <cit> . in the latter report, overexpression of hsp <dig> was shown to protect microtubules from heat shock and ph-induced collapse, although the contribution of phsp <dig> to this effect was not reported  <cit> .

phsp <dig> also appears to be required for the migration of several cell types  <cit> . a recent study concluded that p38mapk activation and hsp <dig> phosphorylation played a key role in the regulation of actin polymerization, possibly by regulating the spatial organization of the lamellopodia by promoting branch formation at the leading edge and stability at the base  <cit> . they suggest that at the dynamic leading edge of lamellopodia, hsp <dig> might promote branching by its actin-capping activity, while at the base p38mapk remains active and hsp <dig> is phosphorylated and might stabilize actin filaments.

mutations of the small hsp  genes have been linked to axonal charcot-marie-tooth disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy   <cit> . this appears to be related to the disruption of the neurofilament networks by the aggregation of neurofilament proteins and collapse of neurofilament networks  <cit> . this study and recent commentaries  <cit>  point to the importance of the small heat shock proteins like hsp <dig> in regulating or modulating the function of cytoskeletal elements other than actin. however, the mechanisms underlying the function of hsp <dig> and its regulation remain essentially unknown in neuronal cells.

our results suggest that hsp <dig> is necessary for the initiation of neurite outgrowth in drg neurons. the data also suggest that phosphorylation of hsp <dig> plays a key role in modulating the dynamic interactions of hsp <dig> with cytoskeletal elements such as actin and tubulin to regulate the response of drg neurons to environmental cues that mediate growth.

CONCLUSIONS
using immunocytochemistry, we observed colocalization of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of hsp <dig> with actin and tubulin in both very early and later stages of neurite growth from cultured adult drg neurons. the colocalization of hsp <dig> and phsp <dig> with actin in lamellopodia and focal contacts at early neurite initiation stages, and in processes, branch points and growth cones in later stages suggests that hsp <dig> may play a role in neurite initiation and extension and potentially in the patterning of this growth. while the mechanisms of action require further investigation, it is possible that one role of hsp <dig> is to stabilize the cytoskeleton at potential sites of branching or sprouting. hsp <dig> has been reported to play a key role in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics as an actin-capping protein in non-neuronal cells and our results suggest that this may also be the case in neurons. neurons treated with cytochalasin d showed aberrant neurite growth patterns. neurons treated with p <dig> mapk inhibitors, which inhibit the downstream phosphorylation of hsp <dig>  also displayed either lack of neurite growth or failure of appropriate neurite extension. the similar results from the cytd and inhibition of hsp <dig> phosphorylation support a role for hsp <dig> in neurite outgrowth via its phosphorylation state-dependent interactions with actin.
