BACKGROUND
paenibacillus vortex strain v <dig>  <cit>  is a bacterial species discovered in the early 90's  <cit> . it is a social microorganism that forms colonies with remarkably complex and dynamic architectures   <cit> . the genus paenibacillus, including p. vortex, was originally considered a part of the genus bacillus but was later reclassified as a separate genus in  <dig>  <cit> . these facultative anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria are found in a variety of heterogeneous environments, such as soil, rhizosphere, insect larvae, and clinical samples  <cit> .

to face the challenges posed by these environments, paenibacillus spp. produce a wealth of enzymes and proteases as well as a great variety of antimicrobial substances that affect a wide range of microorganisms  <cit> . the possession of these advanced defensive and offensive strategies render the paenibacillus spp. bacteria as a rich source of useful genes for agricultural, medical, industrial applications. despite this potential, genome sequencing of paenibacillus spp. to date is limited and is currently available only for two species paenibacillus larvae and paenibacillus sp. jdr- <dig> 

a successful behavioral strategy utilized by some paenibacillus spp. is to cooperatively form and develop large and intricately organized colonies of 109- <dig> cells. being part of a large cooperative, the bacteria can better compete for food resources and be protected against antibacterial assaults  <cit> . two of the most fascinating pattern-forming paenibacillus spp. bacteria, are p. vortex  <cit>  and p. dendritiformis  <cit> . under laboratory growth conditions, these bacteria can develop, like other social bacteria, colonies that behave much like a multi-cellular organism, with cell differentiation and task distribution  <cit>  .

p. vortex possesses advanced social motility employing cell-cell attractive and repulsive chemotactic signaling and physical links . when grown on soft surfaces, the collective motility is reflected by the formation of foraging swarms  <cit>  that act as arms sent out in search for food . these swarms have an aversion to crossing each other's trail and collectively change direction when food is sensed. the swarms can even split and reunite when detecting scattered patches of nutrients  <cit> .

when grown on hard surfaces, p. vortex generates special aggregates of dense bacteria that are pushed forward by repulsive chemotactic signals sent from the cells at the back . these rotating aggregates , are similar to the rotating bacteria groups generated by paenibacillus alvei  <cit>  and bacillus circulans  <cit> , pave the way for the colony to expand. the vortices serve as building blocks of colonies with special modular organization .

accomplishing such intricate cooperative ventures requires sophisticated cell-cell communication  <cit> . communicating with each other, bacteria exchange information regarding population size, a myriad of individual environmental measurements at different locations, their internal states and their phenotypic and epigenetic adjustments  <cit> . the bacteria collectively sense the environment and execute distributed information processing to glean and assess relevant information  <cit> . next, the bacteria respond accordingly, by reshaping the colony while redistributing tasks and cell differentiations, and turning on defense and offense mechanisms  <cit> , thus achieving better adaptability to heterogeneous environments  <cit> . such collective, decentralized, adaptive decision making is a form of swarm intelligence, a term originally derived from cybernetics but applicable to some aspects of colonial organisms including ants, birds, humans and bacteria  <cit> . in terms of collective social behaviour, p. vortex has been studied extensively at the level of mathematical modeling  <cit>  and now requires a sequenced genome to connect this approach with the underlying genetics.

comparative genomic analysis revealed that bacteria successful in heterogeneous and competitive environments often contain extensive signal transduction and regulatory networks  <cit> . it is likely that advanced social behavior  <cit>  and elevated collective adaptability  <cit>  are underpinned by a highly developed signal transduction system consisting of modular domains forming a network of sensors, transducers and responders  <cit> .

in this report we present the de novo genome sequence of the p. vortex, which was obtained by utilizing a hybrid deep-sequencing approach using  <dig> and illumina techniques  <cit> . we further performed detailed comparative genomic analysis with a dataset of  <dig> complete bacterial genomes to discover p. vortex unique properties. the results revealed that p. vortex has one of the highest number of signal transduction genes among all the gram-positive bacteria in the dataset. only two other gram-positive bacteria strains, the paenibacillus sp. jdr- <dig> and the geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig>  have more tcs genes. these two species and p. vortex have equal normalized combined score of tcs, tfs, transport and defense related genes , which is significantly higher than the combined score of all other bacteria in the data set.

the analysis also unveiled genes required for competition over resources , for producing offensive compounds  and for defense . these genes can support traits needed for thriving in the heterogeneous and highly competitive environments.

RESULTS
sequencing of the p. vortex genome
hybrid assembly
de novo assembly of the p. vortex genome was obtained using the two leading deep-sequencing technologies: roche  <dig> genome sequencer   <cit>  and illumina genome analyzer   <cit> . using the roche  <dig> and the illumina ga technologies, 19× coverage of single reads and 270× total average coverage of single and paired-end mapped reads was produced respectively . the reads from each technology were first assembled separately and then joined into a hybrid assembly to improve scaffold size and quality . the hybrid assembly  contains  <dig> scaffolds totaled  <dig> , <dig> bp with n <dig> scaffold size of  <dig>  bp and largest scaffold of  <dig>  bp. notably, the contigs from the two technologies could be joined easily as no miss-assemblies were detected between the two sets of contigs. the first version of the whole genome shotgun project described in this paper has been deposited at .

assembly accuracy and completeness
to estimate the accuracy and the completeness of the hybrid assembly we performed detailed comparison between the  <dig> and the illumina contigs. the results show that the  <dig> contigs covered  <dig> % of the hybrid assembly with an average distance between contigs comprising the hybrid scaffolds of - <dig> bp and total  <dig> bp missing from the hybrid assembly . the illumina contigs covered  <dig> % of the hybrid assembly with average distance between contigs of - <dig> bp and missing total  <dig>  bp . the overall sequence identity between the two technologies was  <dig> %. these results and the fact that there were no miss-assemblies demonstrate that although the p. vortex assembly is in several contigs, it provides complete genome coverage and with an extremely high accuracy .

scaffolds ordering
to obtain a putative order of the p. vortex scaffolds, we used geobacillus. sp. y412mc <dig> genome  as a reference and ordered the p. vortex scaffolds accordingly. our preliminary genomic comparison identified geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> as the closest bacteria with a complete genome to p. vortex. the identification was based on phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> s rdna placing the geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> within the p. vortex clade  and further supported by genomic clustering of cluster of orthologous groups  profiles  <cit>  . blastn comparison results of p. vortex genome vs. geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig>  revealed that 2/ <dig> of the p. vortex genome could be matched to geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> with an average sequence identity of  <dig> % over a mean alignment length of  <dig> bp .

general genome statistics
the p. vortex genome is composed of a circular chromosome  with an average g+c content of  <dig> % . a total of  <dig>  open reading frames  were identified covering 86% of the p. vortex genome . among the predicted orfs,  <dig>   were assigned with a putative function, whereas  <dig>   were identified as hypothetical proteins. we identified  <dig> non-coding rna genes and  <dig> trna genes predicted to incorporate  <dig> amino acids into polypeptides. the tentative location of the origin of replication  was identified based on its proximity to dnaa gene, known to serve as a transcription initiator protein  <cit> .

repetitive sequences
we have identified several types of repetitive sequences:  <dig> global repeats ,  <dig> local inverted repeats and  <dig> tandem repeats within the p. vortex genome  . such sequences were suggested to play an important functional role in genome plasticity  <cit> , by means of homologous recombination , horizontal transfer or transposition in the genome  <cit> . hr has relevant roles in dna repair, chromosome segregation and generation of genetic variation. crossover events might produce genome rearrangements, such as deletions, leading to the loss of all genetic information in that region or duplications which could increase the amount of genetic information  <cit> . additionally, repeats located within regulatory regions might constitute an on/off switch of gene expression at the transcriptional level  <cit> . similarly, repeats located within coding regions can induce a premature ending of translation when a mutation changes the number of repeats  <cit> . however, detailed mechanisms and functions of most repeats are still unknown.

repetitive sequences are the major reason for the difficulty we encountered in finishing the genome assembly into a complete sequence. analysis of the scaffold ends  revealed that 78% of them have repetitive sequences that are on average  <dig> bp long and could be mapped on average onto  <dig> different scaffold ends.

we note that some regions in the p. vortex genome have an extremely high coverage . although, the assembly algorithms tend to collapse the highly identical repetitive sequences into one copy, high coverage in that specific area might serve as a signature for identifying regions present in several copy numbers in the genome  <cit> . for example, the ribosomal unit  has approximately  <dig> times higher coverage than the average, suggesting that this unit appears approximately  <dig> times in the p. vortex genome. interestingly, the geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> has  <dig> copies of the ribosomal unit.

functional validation by custom microarray
we used specially designed agilent custom microarray submitted to embl-ebi  to validate the annotation. the microarray  includes  <dig>  oligos of  <dig> bp long, which corresponds to all the predicted orfs and the intergenic regions.

hybridization of the genomic dna validated  <dig>  probes  of the total designed probes and no missed regions were found . hybridization of the pooled rna from different growth conditions confirmed  <dig>   of the predicted orfs. the remaining  <dig>   orfs were not detectable under the tested conditions. out of those,  <dig>  orfs have an assigned putative function and  <dig> are hypothetical. hybridization of predicted  <dig> non-coding rnas located within the intergenic regions, confirmed  <dig> .

comparative analysis
we performed detailed comparative analysis between the p. vortex genome and a set of  <dig> complete bacterial genomes of 2- <dig> mbp . bacterial genomes available with draft sequence were not included in the analysis. specifically, we focused on a reduced set of  <dig> genomes with genome size of 4- <dig> mbp  and a subset of  <dig> soil bacteria genomes within this group . the comparison was done with regard to four gene systems which are related to complex bacterial lifestyle and adaptability to fluctuating environments: two-component systems, transcription factors, defense mechanisms and transport systems.

two-component system 
using pfam motifs  <cit>  we identified a total of  <dig> tcs related genes in the p. vortex genome;  <dig> response regulators ,  <dig> histidine-kinases  and  <dig> hybrid kinases. the number of tcs genes was linear with genome size in agreement with  <cit> . among the  <dig> bacterial genomes, p. vortex was at the upper 1% of the population , along with two gram-positive bacteria strains paenibacillus sp. jdr- <dig>  and geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig>  and two gram-negative bacteria strains, the predator myxobacterium m. xanthus  and the cyanobacterium n. punctiforme pcc  <dig> . our results show that similarly to the absolute gene numbers, the relative gene numbers of the tested categories in p. vortex genome is also significantly higher compared to the rest of the  <dig> genomes .

structural classification of the p. vortex rrs according to previously proposed scheme  <cit>  revealed relatively high number of  <dig> ompr family and  <dig> arac family dna-binding response regulators. class organization of the p. vortex tcs proteins as described in  <cit>  revealed  <dig> hk-rr paired,  <dig> orphaned  and  <dig> in complex gene clusters . neighborhood analysis of the tcs surrounding genes revealed that  <dig>  are transport related genes,  <dig>  have regulatory functions , and  <dig>  belong to the energy metabolism category .

transcription factors 
using the method described in  <cit> , we identified a total of  <dig> tfs in p. vortex genome, which placed it at the upper 5% of the  <dig> bacteria set . this number is considerably higher than the average  <dig> ±  <dig> tfs among the  <dig> bacterial genomes and higher than the average  <dig> ±  <dig> tfs among the subset of  <dig> genomes with size 4- <dig> mbp sizes. among the subset of  <dig> soil bacteria genomes, only two strains, paenibacillus sp. jdr- <dig>  and delftia acidovorans sph- <dig>  have a higher number of tfs genes. we note that an overall linear dependence between the tfs and the genome size was found .

transporter genes
p. vortex encodes an extensive set of  <dig> transport related genes. among the  <dig> bacterial genomes, p. vortex was at the upper 1% of the population , along with additional five strains rhizobium leguminobarum bv. viciae , geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> , paenibacillus sp. jdr- <dig> , sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig>  and sinorhizobium medicae wsm <dig> . about a third,  <dig>  of the genes are involved in carbohydrate transport,  <dig> genes encode components of iron transporters,  <dig> genes encode components of amino acid transporters and  <dig> genes encode components of oligo/dipeptide transporters. the latter could be used as nutrient sources, as well as signal molecules regulating bacterial development, virulence, and conjugal plasmid transfer  <cit> .

defense mechanisms
the p. vortex genome contains  <dig> genes related to resistance against inhibitory substances such as antibiotics, copper, aluminium, arsenic and toxic anions . the proximity of tcs genes to abc transporters is known to form specific and efficient detoxification units  <cit> . out of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> are transporter-encoding genes. non-transport related genes include antibiotic resistance encoding genes such as penicillin binding proteins, beta-lactames, chloramphenicol posphotransferases/acetyltransferases, vanz and vanw glycopeptide antibiotics resistance genes. apart from streptomyces griseus nbrc  <dig> , p. vortex harbors the highest number of defense related genes among the  <dig> analyzed genomes. additionally, p. vortex has the highest number of these genes compared to the subset of  <dig> genomes with a 4- <dig> mbp genome size .

the combined score
when compiling the four indices into a combined score, p. vortex and two other gram-positive bacteria strains, the paenibacillus sp. jdr- <dig> and the geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> stand out among the  <dig> genomes in the dataset . these two species and p. vortex have equal normalized combined score , which is significantly higher than the combined score of all other bacteria in the dataset.

motility and chemotaxis
upon growth on semi-solid surfaces p. vortex exhibits at least one form of swarming motility, a flagellum-driven social form of surface locomotion  <cit> . in figure 5a, we show that propagating p. vortex swarms can collectively change direction towards organic matter added to an agar plate, and can even split and reunite when detecting scattered patches of food . we previously showed, using flagellar staining and light microcopy that swarming p. vortex was peritrichously flagellated   <cit> . these results are in agreement with the dimensions measured by scanning electron microscopy . flagellar motility genes were indentified within the p. vortex genome. these genes are located within five different loci, two of which contain the majority of the genes and are  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb long .

social motility could also be powered by the extension and retraction of type iv pili  <cit> . p. vortex genome contains several pili-related genes such as pilz, pilt, flp pilus assembly protein and prepilin type iv. however, we could not identify all the genes known to be involved in biogenesis and motility of type iv pili  <cit> . furthermore, the fastest known rate of type iv pili related movement does not exceed  <dig> μm/min  <cit> , whereas, p. vortex has an average movement rate of  <dig> μm/min .

previous studies suggest that the vortices are formed by attractive interaction between swarming cells which can be mediated via attractive chemotactic signaling and/or physical links  <cit> . the p. vortex genome contains several chemotaxis related genes, including the chea, cheb, chec, ched, chew and chey. many of the chemotaxis genes are located within the large motility loci . additional  <dig> mcp  genes were found in other locations along the genome.

sporulation and competence
formation of spores and uptake of foreign dna represent an important aspect of bacterial survival strategies. p. vortex genome encodes an extensive set of  <dig> genes responsible for sporulation including cell division, engulfment, cortex and coat synthesis, maturation and germination . the identified sporulation genes included one of the conserved pfam domains  <cit> , tigr domains  <cit> , cog categories  <cit>  or kegg pathways  <cit>  associated with sporulation .

although,  <dig> competence-related genes such as comea, comer and comec were identified, they represent only a small portion of the complete competence pathway  <cit> . additionally, we did not identify homologous genes that belong to the rap system, which plays an important role in the cell decision-making between sporulation and competence  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the common pathway described for sporulation and competence in other gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  is different in p. vortex.

clusters of multifunctional enzymes-secondary metabolites
non-ribosomal peptide synthetases  and polyketide synthases  are large multi-domain proteins that catalyze the biosynthesis of small molecules with potent biological activity. these molecules, which are mainly produced by bacteria and fungi, often serve as "chemical weapons" against neighboring organisms  <cit> . due to their antifungal and antibacterial activities these compounds are also used for medical purposes in the pharmaceutical industry. the pks genes for a certain polyketide are usually organized in one operon in bacteria and in gene clusters in eukaryotes. we identified  <dig> pks,  <dig> nrps and  <dig> pks genes in the p. vortex genome, which were arranged in the following clusters:  a  <dig> kb pks gene cluster, which is comprised of  <dig> pkss involved in polyketide synthesis ;  cluster of  <dig> kb encoding  <dig> nrps, which might be involved in siderophore production  similar to the bacillibactin siderophore produced by bacillus amylolyquefaciens and bacillus subtilis  <cit> , and  a hybrid  <dig> pks/nrps gene cluster of  <dig> kb involved in the production of bacitracin-like antibiotics .

antagonistic effects of bacteria directed against competing organisms could also result from the enzymatic activity of extracellular degrading enzymes. seven chitinase and four  <dig> -beta glucanase encoding genes were identified in the p. vortex genome. these enzymes are involved in degradation of polysaccharide components of the fungal cell wall  <cit> . direct tests showed that the p. vortex can significantly inhibit the growth of verticillium dahlia, a fungal plant pathogen causing vascular wilt diseases in a broad range of host plants. this plant pathogen is distributed in soil worldwide and is of major threat to agriculture crop production, especially in temperate areas of the world  <cit> . p. vortex, which was inoculated six days after v. dahliae inoculation, to allow the establishment of healthy fungal colonies, was able to significantly inhibit the growth of v. dahliae . in the first six days, the diameter of v. dahliae colonies was identical for all treatment and control plates . during  <dig> days post inoculation of the p. vortex, v. dahliae colonies grew only ~ <dig>  cm in diameter, compared to control colonies which grew  <dig>  times faster  .

discussion
whole-genome shotgun pyrosequencing has proved remarkably useful for the large-scale sequencing of bacterial genomes  <cit> . high-quality de novo assemblies can be obtained with relatively few errors and gaps when the sequence read coverage redundancy is 15-fold or greater. closing all the gaps in each genome sequence is time-consuming and costly; therefore, in the near future there will be an excess of draft bacterial sequences versus closed genomes in public databases.

this study presents a de novo assembly of the p. vortex genome utilizing a hybrid deep-sequencing strategy using a roche  <dig> genome sequencer  and an illumina genome analyzer. the use of the two next-generation leading technologies and the combination of the results into a hybrid assembly overcame the drawbacks of each technology and resulted in longer scaffolds. we demonstrated that the sequence identity between the two methods was  <dig> %, reflecting the low error rate of both sequences. the genome sequence, the predicted transcripts and the non-coding rnas were further validated by hybridization to custom microarray.

notably, even when using several algorithms and an extremely high coverage, the data could not be assembled into a single sequence. analysis of the ends of contigs revealed that the unassembled contigs have small repetitive sequences at their ends. the existence of high number of repetitive sequences is a generic obstacle that tempers the ability of the assembly algorithms to generate a single version of the complete genome, and more so when working with short reads. it has been shown that sequence repeats have a functional role that can contribute to genomic plasticity which allows rapid adaptation to environmental changes  <cit> .

p. vortex was originally isolated from colonies of b. subtilis, soil bacteria commonly found in the rhizosphere  <cit> . the rhizosphere is characterized by large environmental fluctuations, which act as a selecting force determining the diversity of the microbial community  <cit> . the features identified in the genome of p. vortex suggest that these bacteria can lead a successful lifestyle in the highly competitive environment of the rhizosphere as well as serve as an efficient plant beneficial rhizobacteria . pbr competitively colonize plant roots and can simultaneously act as biofertilizers and as antagonists  of recognized root pathogens  <cit> .

comparative genomics and comparative network biology are emerging as key tools in understanding of how bacteria respond cooperatively to challenging complex environments. in particular, it was previously suggested that bacteria successful in heterogeneous and competitive environments often contain extensive signal transduction and regulatory networks  <cit> . these observations, and the fact that signal transduction networks afford intracellular information processing  <cit> , led to the notion that the number and fraction of signal transduction genes can be used as a measure of the "bacteria iq"  <cit> . detailed comparative genomic analysis revealed that the p. vortex's genome and the genome of the gram-negative, social and predatory bacterium m. xanthus  <cit>  have exceptionally high number of tcs genes, supporting the notion that they are required for advanced social behavior.

the p. vortex species is marked by its complex spatial organization of the colony, with the bacteria forming different patterns to better cope with the environment  <cit> . pattern-formation and self-organization in microbial systems is an intriguing phenomenon that might also provide insights into the evolutionary development of the concerted action of cells in higher organisms  <cit> . therefore, sequencing of the p. vortex genome paves the way to understanding of regulatory processes involved in cell-cell communication and colonial patterning and more generally, to understanding of cooperative bacterial response to changing environmental conditions. such information should facilitate increased exploitation of paenibacillus spp. in industrial, agricultural and medical fields, as well as help us comprehend the evolutionary development of multicellular organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
the p. vortex genome was sequenced using a hybrid deep-sequencing approach resulting in an estimated genome size of  <dig>  mb. a total of  <dig>  orfs were identified and 73% of them confirmed using specially designed agilent custom microarray chip. the results of the two sequencing methods were compared resulting in  <dig> % sequence identity, reflecting low error rate of both sequences. the use of the two next-generation leading technologies and the combination of the results into a hybrid assembly overcame the drawbacks of each technology and resulted in longer scaffolds.

comparative genomics analysis with  <dig> complete bacterial genomes revealed that p. vortex has one of the highest number of tcs genes among all the gram-positive bacteria in the dataset. high numbers of tcs genes were also found in the genome of the social predator m. xanthus, supporting the notion that they are required for advanced social behavior. m. xanthus serves as an important gram-negative bacterial model for the study of multicellularity in prokaryotes  <cit> . similarly, p. vortex may have the potential to provide significant insights on cell-cell interactions, pattern formation and social behavior in gram-positive bacteria. additionally, p. vortex encodes an extensive set of tfs, transport and defense related genes. these findings suggest that p. vortex has a highly developed signal transduction system and that these genes can support traits needed for thriving in heterogeneous, fluctuating and highly competitive environments.

the genome sequence of p. vortex provides the basis for understanding of social organization and pattern formation within gram-positive bacteria. p. vortex is the first sequenced paenibacillus species reported to show these properties and this work supports the development of genetic approaches to the study of prokaryotic multicellularity and multi-agent decision making . furthermore, this organism is likely to become a valuable resource for exploitation within biotechnology.
