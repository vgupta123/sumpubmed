BACKGROUND
endogenous small interfering rnas  and micrornas  are the two most abundant classes of plant small rnas . the small rnas are processed in the nucleus from longer precursor transcripts that form distinct secondary structures. the mirnas down-regulate gene expression by targeting specific messenger rnas  in both plants and animals  <cit> .

mirnas were initially discovered in caenorhabditis elegans as developmental timing regulators in  <dig>  <cit> . the existence of mirnas in organisms including plants, mammals and virus has widely been recognized. the biogenesis of mirnas in plants is a multi-step enzymatic process involving incorporation of mirnas into the rna-induced silencing complex , and then mirnas bind target mrnas to direct for cleavage mirnas with near perfect complementarity and/or inhibiting translation of those with lower complementarity  <cit> . there has been ample evidence demonstrating that mirnas play a regulatory role in diverse biochemical and physiological processes in plants  <cit> . for instance, mirnas have been shown to play a role in the modulation of the processes associated with growth and development in plants, including leaf morphogenesis, floral organ and root development  <cit> . in addition, recent studies also revealed that mirnas are involved in responses of plants to various abiotic and biotic stresses. these include drought  <cit> , cold  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , nutrient starvation  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , submergence  <cit> , uv-b radiation  <cit>  and virus  <cit> .

plants are hardly grown under optimal conditions, and have to frequently suffer from drought stress due to shortage of water supply. not unexpectedly, the involvement of mirnas in response of plants to drought has been evaluated in several plant species. a number of mirnas have been identified to be associated with response to drought stress in several species such as arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and oryza sativa  <cit> . for instance, zhou et al.  identified  <dig> down-regulated mirnas and  <dig> up-regulated mirnas in response of rice to drought  <cit> . it has been reported that mir169g is the only member induced by drought in the mir <dig> family of rice and its expression is regulated by drought  <cit> . li et al.  found that mir169a and mir169c are substantially down-regulated by drought, leading to the enhanced resistance to drought in arabidopsis because one of the mir169's targets, nfya <dig> , is a crucial transcription factor regulating the expression of a number of drought stress-responsive genes  <cit> . recent studies also demonstrated that mirnas play a role in control of drought resistance in maize by modulating the expression of mapk , pld , pdh  and pod   <cit> . more recently, trinadade et al.  reported that mir <dig> and mir <dig> are up-regulated by water deficit in medicago truncatula, leading to a down-regulation of their target genes of cox5b, csd <dig> and plantacyanin  <cit> . in triticum dicoccoides,  <dig> mirnas are differentially regulated in response to short-term drought stress by mirna microarray chip  <cit> . despite of numerous studies on the involvement of mirnas in abiotic stress in general and drought stress in particular, there has been no report on the systemic identification of drought-responsive mirnas in leguminous plants at the global genome-level by high-throughout sequencing.

leguminous plants account for one third of primary crop production in the world and are important sources for the consumption of human and animals  <cit> . drought stress is one of the most frequently occurred environmental stresses that limit crop yield world-wide. medicago truncatula is an annual legume species distinguished by its small diploid genome and easy transformation, and is a model plant to study functional genomics of legume plants  <cit> . although numerous mirnas have been identified in various plant species and the mechanisms underlying their actions are being unravelled, the discovery of new mirnas in plants on a genome-wide scale is essential for functional characterization of mirnas. the traditional sequencing of relatively small-size cdna libraries of plant srnas from arabidopsis, rice and poplar with sanger method has led to the conclusions that plant mirnas are highly conserved  <cit> . however, a small number of mirnas was not detected in the genomes of some species, indicating that mirnas may evolve more recently  <cit> . in addition, the non-conserved mirnas are often expressed at a lower level than the conserved mirnas, thus many non-conserved mirnas cannot be detected in small-scale sequencing studies. in this context, high-throughput sequencing has been used to identify non-conserved mirnas in several species  <cit> . to understand the role of mirnas in response of plants to drought stress, we identified a number of conserved and non-conserved mirnas that were responsive to drought by high-throughput sequencing, and their potential role in drought tolerance was discussed.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing of small rnas from m. truncatula
two srna libraries in which m. truncatula seedlings were treated with drought stress  and without stress, control  constructed from shoots of seedlings grown under the two treatment-regimes were sequenced by an illumina-solexa sequencer. high-throughput sequencing of ck and ds libraries led to generation of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> primary reads, respectively. there were  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  for ck and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  for ds after initial processing . the length distribution of reads showed that the majority of the reads was 20- <dig> nt in size, of which the class of  <dig> nt was the most abundant group followed by the group of  <dig> nt class .

the common/specific sequences were analyzed between ck and ds libraries for the total and unique sequences. there were  <dig> % and  <dig> % specific sequences in the ds library for total and unique sequences, respectively.

after initial processing, the high-quality small rna reads were mapped to the m. truncatula genome sequence  using soap  <cit> . the number of total and unique sequences that matched genome was  <dig> ,034/ <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,359/ <dig> , <dig> in the two libraries, respectively .

identification of known mirnas
the known mirnas in m. truncatula were identified by comparing with the up-dated mirnas database   <cit> . we identified  <dig> and  <dig> known mirnas in the two libraries, respectively . sixty-six members belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families were obtained after removing those mirnas whose expression levels are too low to be analysed for differential expression. of these families, the most abundant two reads were mir <dig> and mir <dig>  among the identified mirnas, mir <dig> contained the most members, including mir399a-i and mir399k-q .

in addition to the conserved mirnas, we also identified  <dig> non-conserved mirnas that belong to  <dig> mirna families  after removing mirnas with expression levels that were too low to be analysed for differential expression. among the 137non-conserved mirnas, some were legume-specific. the most abundant mirna was mir <dig> followed by mir <dig> in the control  library. in the drought stress  library, mir <dig> was the most abundant, followed by mir <dig>  in addition, mir <dig> was found to have the most members in the two libraries .

identification of new mirnas/new members of known mirna families
the formation of stable hairpin structure is one of the essential features for identification of new mirnas  <cit> . to identify new mirnas and new members of known mirna families, we pooled the reads obtained from the two libraries, and identified the mirnas by folding the sequences of potential mirna precursors using the mfold web server  <cit> . we obtained  <dig> potential mirna candidates . in addition to the hairpin structure, detection of mirna*s is another proof that has been widely used to confirm the new mirnas  <cit> . among the  <dig> potential mirna candidates, we found  <dig> mirnas with complementary mirna*s , indicating that these candidate mirnas are likely to be new mirnas or new members of known mirna families in m. truncatula. the counts of several mirna*s of these mirnas were low . this may make the annotation of these new mirnas questionable. however, no requirement on the counts of several mirna*s was given in the most recent criteria for annotation of plant mirnas  <cit> . therefore, these mirnas were still considered to be new mirnas or new members of known mirnas. a similar identification of new mirnas has also been reported by others in the literature. for instance, candidate mirnas with only one mirna* have been identified as new mirnas in rice  <cit> .

twenty-two out of  <dig> new mirnas/new members of known mirna families had length of  <dig> nt, while remaining mirnas had length of  <dig> nt. the majority of the mirnas started with a 5' uridine, a hallmark of mirnas  <cit> . the minimum free energy  for hairpin structure of mirna precursors was lower than - <dig> kcal/mol . this feature is in agreement with other reported values in the literature  <cit> . the length of new mirnas' precursors ranged from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt . these values are comparable to those reported for m. truncatula in the literature  <cit> .

response of known mirnas to drought stress
to identify drought-responsive mirnas, the normalized expression of mirnas in the two libraries  was compared. based on the results of high-throughput sequencing, we selected those mirnas with changes in expression levels being greater than  <dig> -fold in response to drought treatment  to validate the expression patterns by real-time quantitative pcr. as shown in figure 3b and 3c, expression patterns of drought-responsive mirnas from high-throughput sequencing and rt-qpcr exhibited similar results. results from both the methods showed that  <dig> members in  <dig> mirna families, i.e., mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were up-regulated in response to the drought stress. conversely,  <dig> members belonging to  <dig> mirna families, i.e., mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were down-regulated in response to drought stress . these mirnas have been reported to be involved in diverse cellular processes in plants  <cit> . the known target genes of these mirnas and their function annotations were summarized in table  <dig>  for those mirnas whose targets are not known, we predicted their targets using the psrnatarget http://bioinfo <dig> noble.org/psrnatarget/ and the srna-tools http://srna-tools.cmp.uea.ac.uk/plant/ <cit> , and the results are given in the table  <dig>  among these mirnas, several mirnas have been reported to be involved in abiotic stresses. for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been reported to be up-regulated by phosphate starvation  <cit> , while mir <dig> with target of ccaat binding factor is down-regulated in response to drought stress  <cit> .

response of new mirnas/new members in known mirna families to drought stress
we further examined whether the  <dig> new mirnas/new members of known mirna families were responsive to drought stress using the same method as the known mirnas. the mirnas with changes in expression levels being greater than  <dig> -fold and p-values less than  <dig>  are presented in table  <dig>  results from high-throughput sequencing and rt-qpcr showed that, among the  <dig> new mirnas,  <dig> mirnas were responsive to drought stress with mir5274b and mir <dig> being up-regulated, while mir5554a-c being down-regulated. in addition, among the  <dig> new members of known mirna families,  <dig> mirnas were responsive to drought stress with mir2111u, v being up-regulated and mir4414a being down-regulated .

discussion
high-throughput sequencing of m. truncatula small rnas
high-throughput sequencing has been used to study mirnas at whole genome level in several plant species, including arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , brachypodium  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , populus  <cit> , citrus  <cit> , peanut  <cit> , porphyra  <cit> . however, most of the studies on high-throughput sequencing mirnas have focused on mirnas under non-stressed, normal growth conditions, and only a few studies have compared mirnas under control conditions to those under conditions of abiotic stresses by high-throughput sequencing plant mirnas  <cit> . for instance, sunkar et al.  reported a total of  <dig>  reads in rice seedlings from three independent libraries   <cit> . twenty-eight and  <dig> mirnas in response to cold stress in brachypodium  <cit>  and heat stress in wheat  <cit>  have been identified by high-throughput sequencing, respectively. in the present study, we constructed two srna libraries, non-stressed, control and drought stressed in legume model plant, m. truncatula and identified known and new mirnas that were responsive to drought stress.

the successful application of high-throughput sequencing technology to systemically identify plant mirnas has greatly advanced our knowledge on the functions of mirnas in plants in recent years. there have been several reports on the identification of mirnas in m. truncatula in the literature. for instance,  <dig>  and  <dig>  srna reads were reported in two recent studies from m. truncatula by jagadeeswaran et al.  and lelandais-briere et al. , respectively, with  <dig>  unique sequences being obtained by the latter studies  <cit> . however, in both cases, srnas were sequenced using roche  <dig> sequencer, and the total reads and unique sequences obtained from these studies are much less than we reported in the present study . in a study by szittya et al. , the authors obtained  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences from two srnas libraries of m. truncatula using the same high-throughput sequencing technology   <cit> . in contrast to these reported findings, we got a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads and  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences from two libraries of m. truncatula. therefore, our results contain more reads than those previously reported for mirnas in m. truncatula in the literature. moreover, the high-throughput sequencing technology used in the present study allows us to identify the mirnas with low abundance, thus accounting for the greater unique sequences found in our studies. in addition to the greater amounts of mirnas sequencing data, the use of most updated mirbase also contributes to our identification of more known mirnas in m. truncatula. the available database for m. truncatula contains more mirnas than those for other plant species. for example, in the database, there are  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mirnas for brachypodium and wheat, respectively, while there are  <dig> mirnas in the database for m. truncatula . in addition, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to use the m. truncatula genome sequence mt <dig>  to analyze mirnas in this species. the more genomic information in mt <dig>  than mt <dig>  may also contribute to predicting more new mirnas in m. truncatula.

drought-responsive mirnas
plant mirnas have a strong propensity to target genes associated with development, particularly those genes encoding transcription factors and f-box proteins  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the known or predicted targets of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were either transcription factors or f-box proteins . under drought stress, an increase in root/shoot ratio was found in m. truncatula . mir <dig> has been reported to regulate root development by a homeostatic mechanism to clear nac <dig> mrna, leading to down-regulation of auxin signals. it has been shown that decreases in nac <dig> mrna levels due to inducible expression of mir <dig>  thus resulting in reduction in lateral root emergence in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that the suppression of mir <dig> expression may contribute to the increase in root/shoot ratio under drought stress.

several studies have revealed that mir <dig> is responsive to abiotic stresses such as drought, cold and salinity in different species  <cit> . under drought stress, mir <dig> exhibited different expression patterns among different species. for example, in arabidopsis, mir <dig> is down-regulated by drought stress through an aba-dependent pathway, resulting in accumulation of nfya <dig> with high affinity and sequence specificity for the ccaat box, which is crucial for the expression of a number of drought-responsive genes  <cit> . in contrast to arabidopsis, mir169g in rice is up-regulated by drought  <cit> . in rice, dres  as the upstream of mir169g are regulated by cold and drought stress, thus leading to up-regulation of mir169g  <cit> . trindade et al.  reported that the expression of mir <dig> in leaves of m. truncatula is not responsive to drought stress  <cit> . in contrast, our results from both the high-throughput sequencing and rt-qpcr showed that mir <dig> was down-regulated under drought stress in m. truncatula . this discrepancy may result from the difference in degree of drought stress exposed to plant materials in the two studies. for instance, in the present study, the drought stressed samples were collected after exposing of plants to drought for varying period , thus our samples included plant materials suffering from a wide range of drought stress. this type of stress has been used in study of molecular response of plants to drought stress  <cit> . in the studies of trindade et al. , water stress was exposed by suppressing water supply with relative water content in leaves being approx. 50% and 30%, respectively  <cit> . in the present paper, the drought stressed leaves with relative water content of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were used for analysis of mirnas. therefore, our samples were mainly those suffering from mild and moderate water stress compared to those of trindale et al. . if mir <dig> is responsive to mild and/or early drought stress exclusively, the responsiveness of mir <dig> may not be detected by the more severe drought stress used by the authors  <cit> . in addition to withholding water supply, several studies on effect of drought on mirnas also treated plants with peg or mannitol for varying period  <cit> . it is difficult to compare the natural drought stress with peg-induced and/or mannitol osmotic stress as the two treatments may differ in induction of water stress in terms of rapidity and severity.

accumulation of reactive oxygen species  is a common phenomenon in response of plants to abiotic stress. the accumulated ros damage nucleic acid, oxidize proteins and cause lipid peroxidation  <cit> . superoxide dismutases  detoxify superoxide radicals. the targets of mir <dig> are two cu/zn superoxide dismutases , and mir <dig> expression was reported to be down-regulated transcriptionally by oxidative stresses  <cit> . oxidative stress often occurs concurrently with drought stress. in the present study, we found that mir <dig> was down-regulated under drought stress. this would lead to increases in activities of sods. the drought-induced down-regulation of mir <dig> in m. truncatula is consistent with the results in maize  <cit> , but it is contrast to the results reported by trindale et al.   <cit>  and kantar et al.   <cit> . the differences in the expression of mir <dig> among different studies may results from differences in species, extent and duration of drought stress in different studies.

plants suffering from water-deficit often display reduced uptake of mineral nutrients. in this context, mir <dig> negatively regulates the concentration of inorganic phosphate  by targeting pho <dig>  a type of e <dig> conjugase, and overexpression of mir <dig> in pi-replete conditions represses expression of e <dig> conjugase, leading to an increase in pi concentration in leaves in arabidopsis  <cit> . expression of mir <dig> is reduced under pi-deprived conditions to facilitate accumulation of pi in plants. it has been verified that mir <dig> is up-regulated by pi starvation  <cit> . in our study, the expression mir <dig> and mir <dig> was similar under drought stress. these results indicate that the function of mir <dig> may be as important as mir <dig> in regulation of nutrient acquisition.

exposure of plants to a moderate stress induces resistance to other stresses, a phenomenon known as cross adaptation, which has been found in different combinations of stresses  <cit> . for example, osa-mir <dig> isolated from virus-infected rice tissues is also expressed in roots of salt-stressed plants, while it is not expressed in healthy, non-stressed plants  <cit> . under drought stress, we found that there was up-regulation of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  whose targets may be proteins associated with disease resistance. it is envisaged that these mirnas may enhance the ability of drought tolerance through unknown mechanisms associated with cross adaptation in plants. future work aiming at functional elucidation of these mirnas is warranted by over-expressing these mirnas in m. truncatula.

CONCLUSIONS
we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads from two small rna libraries of m. truncatula by high-throughput sequencing. twenty-two members in  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> members belonging to  <dig> mirna families were found to be up-regulated and down-regulated in response to drought stress by both high-throughput sequencing and rt-qpcr. in addition, we also predicted  <dig> new mirnas/new members of known mirna families, of which  <dig> mirnas were responsive to drought stress by high-throughput sequencing and rt-qpcr. these findings provide valuable information for further functional characterization of mirnas in response to abiotic stress in general and drought stress in particular in legume plants.
