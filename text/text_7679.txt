BACKGROUND
historical processes leave imprints on the genetic structure of existing populations, especially those of long-lived and sessile organisms. the present genetic structure of many species has therefore been used to estimate the relationship between historical vicariance and geological change  <cit> , dispersal history  <cit>  and episodes of expansion and contraction associated with global climate change  <cit> . climate can influence genetic variation by controlling the demography of a species  <cit> . the influence of quaternary climate change on present patterns of genetic variation of some species has been studied  <cit> . gugger  <cit>  verified that late quaternary glacial cycles played an important role in shaping the genetic structure and diversity of the present population of quercus lobata nee. the results showed that quercus lobata maintained a stable distribution with local migration from the last interglacial period  through the last glacial maximum  to the present. this contrasts with large-scale range shifts in quercus alba l  <cit> . more recent climatic oscillations have had profound effects on the dynamics of population expansion and contraction, causing populations to contract into glacial refugia, become extinct and possibly to adapt locally  <cit> . cycads are an ancient plant form, and their current genetic structure and population dynamic history are not fully understood. therefore, they are valuable for contemporary researchers to study what they experienced in history and how they respond to historic climate change.

cycads are the most primitive living seed plants. fossil evidence shows that cycads originated approximately 275– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . molecular evidence also shows that cycads originated much earlier than flowering plants  <cit> , which originated approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . although cycads are generally long-lived  <cit> , they presently comprise a relatively small group with two families  and ten genera  <cit> . they are currently considered to be the most threatened groups of organisms on the planet  <cit> . cycads are distributed in africa, asia, australia and south and central america; 62% of the known cycad species are threatened with extinction  <cit> . there is only one cycad genus, cycas, in china, and it is considered to be the oldest cycads genus  <cit> . all cycads have been given ‘first grade’ conservation status in china  <cit> .

cycas simplicipinna  k. hill was formally described in  <dig>  it is distinguishable by having the morphological characteristics of a shrub, an unremarkable trunk, and lanceolate cataphylls and is distributed in the yunnan province of china, laos, northern thailand, and vietnam. the species is dioecious and allogamous. their seeds are mainly distributed by weight and usually distribute around the mother plant. so the phenomenon of severe inbreeding is common in the species, resulting in the expected high genetic differentiation and structure by using maternally inherited dna. despite being a national key protected plant, the genetic diversity and genetic structure of c. simplicipinna has not been studied in detail. the reasons for its endangerment are unclear. this study was undertaken to provide better understanding of the species’ genetic diversity and genetic structure and the reasons for its endangerment. field surveys showed that there are two populations with fewer than  <dig> individuals. it is urgent to develop effective protection measures that are based on a comprehensive study of its genetic diversity and population structure.

the organelle dna of cycads is maternally inherited and is dispersed only in seeds  <cit> . their nuclear dna  is biparentally inherited and is dispersed by both seeds and pollen. microsatellite markers  are known to be codominant and to have more genetic variation than other molecular markers. in this study, we used cpdna , nrdna  and ssr markers. the main aim of the study was to evaluate the genetic diversity, genetic structure and demographic history of c. simplicipinna and to provide basic guidelines for its conservation.

methods
study species
a total of  <dig> individual samples were collected from seven populations of c. simplicipinna . of the  <dig> samples,  <dig> individuals from the seven populations were used for chloroplast and nuclear dna sequencing. the population known as bol was eliminated from ssr analysis because there were only  <dig> individuals. a total of  <dig> individuals from six populations were used for the microsatellite study. information on each sampling location and the number of individuals from each population that were used in dna sequences and ssr analyses are presented in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  respectively.

molecular procedures
young and healthy leaves were collected and dried immediately in silica gel for dna extraction. genomic dna was extracted from dried leaves using the modified ctab method  <cit> . after preliminary screening of 21– <dig> samples  with universal chloroplast and nuclear primers, we chose two cpdna intergenic spacers, psba-trnh  <cit>  and trnl-trnf  <cit> , and one nrdna internal transcribed spacer, its4-its <dig>  <cit> , for complete analysis. the three pairs of fragments were amplified for the most polymorphic sites of the  <dig> individuals. pcr amplification was carried out in 40 μl reactions. for cpdna, the pcr reactions contained 20 ng dna,  <dig>  μl mgcl <dig> ,  <dig>  μl dntps ,  <dig>  μl 10 × pcr buffer,  <dig>  μl of each primer,  <dig>  μl taq dna polymerase   and 26 μl double-distilled water. for nrdna, the pcr reactions contained 40 ng dna,  <dig>  μl mgcl <dig> ,  <dig>  μl dntps ,  <dig>  dmso,  <dig>  μl 10 × pcr buffer,  <dig>  μl of each primer,  <dig>  μl taq dna polymerase   and  <dig>  μl double-distilled water. pcr amplifications were performed in a thermocycler under the following conditions: an initial 5 min denaturation at 80°c, followed by 29 cycles of 1 min at 95°c, 1 min annealing at 50°c, and a  <dig>  min extension at 65°c, and a final extension for 5 min at 65°c for cpdna intergenic spacers. for nrdna sequences we used an initial 4 min denaturation at 94°c, which was followed by 29 cycles of 45 s at 94°c, 1 min annealing at 50°c, and a  <dig>  min extension at 72°c, and a final extension for 9 min at 72°c. all pcr products were sequenced in both directions with the same primers for the amplification reactions, using an abi  <dig> automated sequencer at shanghai sangon biological engineering technology & services company ltd. for nrdna, we cloned individuals which had one or more heterozygous sites in the first sequencing round. six to ten clones were randomly selected and sequenced until the heterozygous site split into two alleles.

microsatellite markers were selected from recently developed nuclear microsatellites in cycas <cit> . pcr amplification was carried out in a 20 μl reaction, containing 10 ng dna,  <dig>  μl mgcl <dig> , 1 μl dntps ,  <dig>  μl 10 × pcr buffer,  <dig>  μl of each primer,  <dig>  μl taq dna polymerase   and  <dig>  μl double-distilled water. pcr amplifications were performed in a thermocycler under the following conditions: an initial 4 min denaturation at 94°c, which was followed by 29 cycles of 40 s each at 94°c, 25 s annealing at 48–60°c, and a 30 s extension at 72°c, and a final extension for 10 min at 72°c. pcr products were checked with 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. then, we made preliminary screening microsatellite loci for c. simplicipinna. the selected microsatellite loci were stained with a fluorescent dye at the 5' end, their pcr products were separated and visualized using an abi  <dig> automated sequencer, and their profiles were read with the genemapper software. an individual was declared null  at a locus and was treated as missing data after two or more amplification failures. finally, we chose polymorphic microsatellite loci for c. simplicipinna after calculating polymorphism indices.

data analysis
data analysis of dna sequences
sequences were edited and assembled using seqman. multiple alignments of the dna sequences were performed manually with clustal x, version  <dig>   <cit> , with subsequent adjustment in bioedit, version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . two cpdna regions were combined. a congruency test for the two combined cpdna regions showed a significant rate of homogeneity  by paup*  <dig> b <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a high degree of homogeneity between the two cpdna regions. the combined cpdna sequences were therefore used in the following analysis.

haplotypes were calculated from aligned dna sequences by dnasp, version  <dig>   <cit> . within- and among-population genetic diversity were estimated by calculating nei’s nucleotide diversity  and haplotype diversity  indices using dnasp, version  <dig>   <cit> . we calculated within-population gene diversity , gene diversity in total populations , and two measures of population differentiation, gst and nst, according to the methods described by pons & petit  <cit>  using the permut,  <dig>  . we used the program arlequin, version  <dig>   <cit>  to conduct an analysis of molecular variance   <cit>  and to estimate the genetic variation that was assigned within and among populations.

phylogenetic relationships among cpdna and nrdna haplotypes of c. simplicipinna were inferred using maximum parsimony  in paup*  <dig> b <dig>  <cit>  and bayesian methods implemented in mrbayes, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . cycas diannanensis was used as the outgroup. we used mega, version  <dig>  <cit> , to construct a neighbor-joining  tree that was based on the neighbor-joining method without using an outgroup. the degree of relatedness among cpdna and among nrdna haplotypes was also estimated using network, version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . in network analysis, indels were treated as single mutational events.

a well-documented evolutionary rate is needed to estimate coalescent time between lineages within populations. we used the evolutionary rates that had previously been estimated for seed plants to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig> - <dig>  × 10- <dig> <cit>  mutation per site per year for synonymous sites for cpdna and ndna, respectively. we used beast, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , to estimate the time of divergence by using the hky model and a strict molecular clock. we also used the beast program to create a bayesian skyline plot with seven steps to infer the historical demography of c. simplicipinna. posterior estimates of the mutation rate and time of divergence were obtained by markov chain monte carlo  analysis. the analysis was run for  <dig> iterations with a burn-in of  <dig> under the hky model and a strict clock. genealogies and model parameters were sampled every  <dig>  iterations. convergence of parameters and mixing of chains were followed by visual inspection of parameter trend lines and checking of effective sampling size  values in three pre-runs. the ess parameter was found to exceed  <dig>  which suggests acceptable mixing and sufficient sampling. adequate sampling and convergence to the stationary distribution were checked using tracer, version  <dig>   <cit> . we used a pairwise mismatch distribution to test for population expansion in dnasp, version  <dig>   <cit> , to further investigate the demography of the species. the sum-of-squared deviations  between the observed and expected mismatch distributions were computed, and p-values were calculated as the proportion of simulations producing a larger ssd than the observed ssd. arlequin, version  <dig>   <cit> , was also used to calculate the raggedness index and its significance to quantify the smoothness of the observed mismatch distribution. the signatures of demographic change were examined by neutrality tests, fu’s fs <cit>  to detect departures from population equilibrium. they were calculated using dnasp, version  <dig>   <cit> .

data analysis of ssr markers
dataset editing and formatting was performed in genalex, version  <dig>   <cit> . we tested for evidence of preliminarily selection of our selected loci because our microsatellites had been derived from recently developed nuclear microsatellites of cycas. we also used the fst-outlier approach to test for signs of positive and balancing selection on those loci  <cit>  by lositan  <cit> . the outlier loci were identified by the expected distribution of wright’s inbreeding coefficient fst compared with he <cit> . as recommended by antao  <cit> , we ran lositan to identify the loci under neutral selection by using the infinite allele model and  <dig>  simulations. twenty microsatellites were first selected after detecting the levels of genetic diversity in the sample of  <dig> individuals of c. simplicipinna in the six populations. the results of positive and balancing selection on the twenty microsatellites detected balancing selection on locus a <dig> and positive selection on four other loci . however, locus a <dig> did not reach the significant level of an fst-outlier . therefore, four loci  with significant levels as fst-outliers were removed from further analysis. finally, we selected sixteen microsatellites with high polymorphism, stability, and conformity with neutral selection for our research .

the number of alleles , private alleles , effective number of alleles , expected heterozygosity , observed heterozygosity , information index , and fixation index ) were calculated using genalex, version  <dig>   <cit> , and popgene, version  <dig>   <cit> , with mutual correction. allelic richness  was estimated with fstat, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and percentage of polymorphic loci  was calculated with genalex, version  <dig>   <cit> . differentiation between pairs of populations was computed using fst and tested with genalex, version  <dig>   <cit> . isolation by distance  was tested on ssr data by computing mantel tests in genalex, version  <dig>   <cit>  using a correlation of fst/ with geographic distance for all pairs of populations. fst/ was caculated with genepop, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . gene flow between pairs of populations was estimated using wright’s principles nm = /4fst <cit> . hardy-weinberg equilibrium  was tested for each locus and each population using genepop, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

the genetic structures of sampled populations and individuals were estimated by unweighted pair group mean analysis  using tepga, version  <dig>   <cit> , with  <dig>  of permutations. an individual-based principal coordinate analysis  was visualized by the program mvsp, version  <dig>   <cit> , using genetic distances among ssr phenotypes. we also conducted a bayesian analysis of population structure on the ssr data using structure, version  <dig>   <cit> . ten independent runs were performed for each set, with values of k ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  a burn-in of 1 ×  <dig> iterations and 1 ×  <dig> subsequent mcmc steps. the combination of an admixture and a correlated-allele frequencies model was used for the analysis. the second-order rate of change of the log probability of the data with respect to the number of clusters  was used as an additional estimator of the most likely number of genetic clusters  <cit> . the best-fit number of grouping was evaluated using Δk by structure harvester, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . finally, we identified geographical locations where major genetic barriers among populations might occur with a barrier boundary analysis, using barrier, version  <dig>   <cit> , based on genetic distance matrices.

we calculated the effective population sizes of each population to establish the degree of endangerment of the species. we used the program ldne at three levels of the lowest allele frequency  at a 95% confidence interval  <cit> . we tested the bottleneck statistic at the population level to explore the demographic history of populations by using different models and testing methods implemented in bottleneck, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the computation was performed under a stepwise mutation model  and a two-phased model . we did not use the standardized differences test in this study because the test was usually used at the condition of having at least twenty polymorphic loci. two other methods  were applied to the two models. we also used a mode shift model  <cit>  to test for bottlenecks in each population. these methods implemented in bottleneck have low power unless the decline is greater than 90%  <cit> . they are most powerful when bottlenecks are severe and recent  <cit> . in addition, a genetic bottleneck was further investigated with the garza-williamsion index . when seven or more loci are analyzed, the garza-williamsion index is lower than the critical mc value of  <dig> , a value obtained by simulations based on the empirical data in bottlenecked populations, suggesting a reduction in population size  <cit> . the garza-williamsion index is more powerful to detect genetic bottlenecks if the bottleneck lasted several generations or if the population made a rapid demographic recovery  <cit> . the index was analyzed by arlequin, version  <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
dna sequences
the combined length of cpdna  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp and aligned with a  <dig>  bp consensus length that contained  <dig> polymorphic sites and  <dig> indels . a total of eight chloroplast haplotypes was identified, and each population was fixed for one particular haplotype, except for population nzd, in which two unique haplotypes was detected . the aligned nrdna  matrix ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp with a consensus length of  <dig>  bp that contained  <dig> polymorphic sites and  <dig> indels . a total of five nuclear haplotypes was derived. population bol had one unique haplotype , mm and ml shared haplotype  <dig>  lua and lu shared haplotype  <dig>  and nzd had two haplotypes  .

genetic diversity indices of total nucleotide  and haplotype  diversity in all populations were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  as inferred from cpdna and  <dig>  and  <dig>  as infered from nrdna . only population nzd showed substantial genetic diversity. total genetic diversity  was higher than the average intrapopulation diversity , resulting in high levels of genetic differentiation . u tests showed that nst was not significantly greater than gst  , which suggests that there is no correspondence between haplotype similarities and their geographic distribution in c. simplicipinna.

the amova revealed that  <dig> % of the genetic variation was partitioned among populations and  <dig> % was within populations at the cpdna level. at the nrdna level,  <dig> % of the genetic variation was partitioned among populations and  <dig> % was within populations . these results indicate that c. simplicipinna has high levels of genetic variation among populations and so high population structure.

a phylogeny of cpdna and nrdna haplotypes was constructed by both maximum parsimony  and bayesian methods, using c. diannanensis as an outgroup. both analyses produced phylogenetic trees with consistent topologies . eight cpdna haplotypes appeared as a comb-like structure because they lacked enough information sites . five nrdna haplotypes were clustered into three clades, showing that hap  <dig> is more closely related to hap  <dig>  and hap  <dig> is more closely related to hap  <dig> . the neighbor-joining trees  supported the congruent phylogenetic relationship of the cpdna and nrdna haplotypes . the haplotype network analysis of cpdna and nrdna also yielded the same topological relationships . most haplotypes were distributed in the outside nodes of the reticulate evolutionary diagram, and many missing haplotypes, specifically between hap  <dig> and hap  <dig>  were evident in the reticulate evolutionary diagram of the nrdna haplotypes .

we derived the estimated time of divergence of c. simplicipinna with the bayesian method, using beast, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the estimated time of divergence ranged from  <dig>  mya to  <dig>  mya according to the cpdna data and  <dig>  mya to  <dig>  mya according to the nrdna data . the cpdna haplotype g  was the earliest to diverge. its time of divergence was estimated to have been  <dig>  mya. the time of divergence of the clade comprising hap a, e, f, and b and the clade comprising hap h, c, and d was  <dig>  mya . the phylogenetic tree of nrdna shows that hap  <dig> was the earliest haplotype to diverge. its time of divergence was  <dig>  mya. the time of divergence between the clade comprising hap  <dig> and  <dig> and the clade comprising hap  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig>  mya . these results imply that the c. simplicipinna haplotypes were diverged during the pleistocene .

population dynamic analysis using cpdna and nrdna data showed that the population demography of c. simplicipinna was stable until approximately  <dig>  years ago, at which time a contraction event occurred . the results of the mismatch analysis for all c. simplicipinna populations displayed a multimodal distribution pattern  with significant ssd and raggedness values , which indicates that c. simplicipinna has not undergone a recent population expansion. this conclusion is also supported by the results of the neutrality test, fu’s f
s
, which yielded positive values . based on a bayesian simulation, the skyline plot showed recent declines in population size of all populations of c. simplicipinna during quaternary glaciations and no subsequent expansion .

ssr data
a total of  <dig> alleles were identified at the sixteen loci. diversity estimates varied in different populations . allelic richness was lowest in population mm  and highest in population lua . the number of alleles  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the number of private alleles  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the effective number of alleles  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the information index  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , observed heterozygosity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and expected heterozygosity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these indices all showed a similar trend, with the lowest values in mm and the highest values in lua. fixation indices  were positive for all six populations, with a mean value f =  <dig> , which suggests a high level of inbreeding within each population. the percentage of polymorphic loci  was high, ranging from 75% to 100%. population mm had the lowest genetic diversity, and lua had the highest. the genetic differentiation coefficient fst varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with a mean value  <dig> . no significant effect of isolation by distance  was detected , as the correlation between genetic and geographic distances was non-significant , which was supported by the result of mantel test. estimates of gene flow between each pair of the six populations are showed in table  <dig>  population lua had the most gene flow with the other populations, and mm had the least. excesses of homozygotes caused five populations and nine loci to deviate from hardy-weinberg equilibrium .

the stucture analysis, using the Δk method, showed that the optimal k value was k =  <dig> , which showed that the six populations were clustered into three groups. populations lua and lu were grouped into one cluster , mm and ml were grouped into another cluster , and nzd and nbh were grouped into a third cluster . the result of k =  <dig> was also present here to detect whether or not has further subdivision in the species. from the figure  <dig> we can see that there is only further subdivision at k =  <dig> between the population lua and lu. in contrast with k =  <dig>  it is clear that k value was k =  <dig> is a better solution, because the existence of three groups was also supported by the pco analysis . two-dimensional pco separated all individuals into three clusters along the two axes. the dendrogram  obtained with the upgma clustering method showed that the six populations were separated into three clades with high bootstrap values . it is the same as structure  and pco analysis. in the upgma clustering dendrogram, populations lua, lu, mm, and ml were clustered into one large clade with a bootstrap value of  <dig> . the barrier analysis showed that there was only one major genetic boundary , with a  <dig> % mean bootstrap value, separating the six populations into two clusters .

estimates of effective population sizes with the lowest allele frequency  as shown by the ldne analysis are listed in table  <dig>  the effective population size of lua and nbh was more than  <dig> and was less than  <dig> in three other populations. the bottleneck analysis was used to calculate mutation-drift equilibrium as estimated with different models and different methods . this analysis indicates that c. simplicipinna did not experience a bottleneck. when tpm was used, only mm had a significant excess of heterozygosity as estimated with the two methods , suggesting that mm deviated from mutation-drift equilibrium. when smm was used, only ml showed a significant excess of heterozygosity . mode shift models showed that all populations had normal l-shaped distributions, which suggests that c. simplicipinna has not experienced a recent severe bottleneck. while all the garza-williamson indices  of the six populations are lower than the critical mc value of  <dig> , which indicate that there was a past reduction of effective population size in the species. populations of c. simplicipinna underwent a demographic bottleneck in history.

discussion
genetic variation and genetic structure
the genetic variation of a species is a product of its long-term evolution and represents its evolutionary potential for survival and development  <cit> . cycads, as ancient gymnosperms with millions of years of evolutionary history, a long life cycle, and overlapping generations, would be expected to have genomes that are responsive to different selective pressures. high levels of genetic variation would be expected to have accumulated during a long evolutionary history. as expected, we found that c. simplicipinna has high genetic diversity  at a species level compared with other species of cycas by using similar markers e.g., an average value of ht =  <dig>  and pi =  <dig>  were reported for two markers of type cpdna in c. debaoensis <cit> , and an average value of ho =  <dig>  and he =  <dig>  and the maximum value of ap =  <dig> , na =  <dig>  were reported for  <dig> markers of type est-microsatellites in c. micronesica <cit> . cycas simplicipinna also has higher genetic diversity than many conifers. many individual conifer species show lower genetic diversity, e.g., an average value of ht =  <dig>  and hs =  <dig>  were reported for two markers of type cpdna in pinus tabulaeformis <cit> , an average value of π =  <dig>  and π =  <dig>  were reported for two markers of type cpdna and one marker of type ndna in tsuga dumosa, respectively  <cit> , and an average value of ht =  <dig> , hs =  <dig> , nr =  <dig> , he =  <dig>  were reported for seven markers of type nuclear microsatellites in taxus baccata <cit> . the mean genetic diversity value of  <dig> plant species that was estimated from cpdna-based studies was ht =  <dig>   <cit> . however, at a population level, c. simplicipinna shows low genetic diversity; only population nzd has a relatively high genetic diversity.

the genetic diversity of c. simplicipinna among all populations  is also higher than the average intra-population diversity , which indicates that there are high levels of genetic differentiation among populations . u tests showed that nst was not significantly greater than gst, suggesting that there is no distinct phylogeographical structure in c. simplicipinna. the fst value of c. simplicipinna  was higher than the mean value of outcrossing species  that was inferred from ssr  <cit> . wright  <cit>  had proposed that an fst value greater than  <dig>   would indicate that there was significant genetic differentiation among populations. additionally, according to the results of deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium test , only population nzd was in hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the remaining five populations deviated significantly from hardy-weinberg equilibrium, and the fixation indices  were greater than zero. we therefore conclude that there is a notable deficit in heterozygosity and severe inbreeding in c. simplicipinna populations, resulting in a high among-population genetic differentiation as a whole.

the genetic structure of c. simplicipinna based on ssr markers showed that the six study populations were divided into three clades . barrier analysis  showed that only one barrier  exists among the six populations, suggesting that clade i and clade ii are genetically more closely related to each other than either is to clade iii. genetic structures of c. simplicipinna derived from organelle and nuclear markers are different. it displays high differentiation at cpdna markers and high distinct structure at biparental markers. this is caused by different features of the markers, such as mutation rates and the biased migration between organelle  and nuclear markers . comparisons of genetic with paleoecological data of temperate woody species are known to reveal unique genetic lineages and⁄ or endemic haplotypes in separate refuge populations  <cit> . although c. simplicipinna is a tropical or subtropical woody species, the species similarly possesses unique genetic lineages and endemic cpdna haplotypes in its separate refuge populations. duminil  <cit>  had proposed that the level of genetic structure in temperate trees and the potential to reflect historical population isolation are determined in part by life history. specifically, species with large geographical ranges and wide-ranging seed dispersal display low differentiation at maternally inherited cpdna markers, and long-lived outcrossing species display low structure at biparental markers. however, c. simplicipinna displays the opposite results. this outcome may be due to its having a limited geographic distribution and severe population inbreeding or to its being a tropical or subtropical woody species, which differs from temperate trees.

the correlation between genetic and geographic distances was non-significant , which indicates that there is no significant effect of isolation by distance . the species lacks of clear geographic structure. it does not automatically mean that the genetic information has no value in directing management. yang and meerow  <cit>  estimated that gene flow distance among local populations in cycas was 2–7 km. however, the distances between extant populations of c. simplicipinna are all greater than 7 km ). because effective gene flow higher than  <dig> is often regarded as high enough to prevent population differentiation due to genetic drift, while gene flow less than  <dig> may be a major reason caused the genetic differentiation among populations <cit> , many gene exchanges between populations less than  <dig> reflect a low level of gene flow . cycas simplicipinna is dioecious and pollenated by insect   <cit> . unlike the birds, weevils can’t spread pollen over a long distance. its seeds are too large to disperse naturally over such a long distance. most seeds disperse near the mother plant, which increases inbreeding. inter-population could not exchange gene flow easily. we therefore conclude that the strong genetic differentiation and structure observed in c. simplicipinna is due mainly to its limited gene flow and severe inbreeding. our analysis therefore suggests that c. simplicipinna has high genetic diversity at the species level, low genetic diversity within populations, high genetic differentiation among populations and a clear genetic structure. this conclusion is also supported by the amova analysis , which shows that almost all of the genetic variation exists among populations . our results support the conclusion that low genetic variation within populations is biologically typical for cycas, unlike other gymnosperms  <cit> .

phylogeny and demographic history
phylogenetic trees constructed on the basis of dna sequences with different criteria in four different software systems all suggested a consistent systematic relationship of haplotypes . the comb-like structure of cpdna haplotypes is likely to be the result of insufficient information site due to insufficient evolutionary time  <cit> . the network analysis  showed that most of the haplotypes were distributed in the outside nodes of the reticulate evolutionary diagrams and there were many missing haplotypes among them. the reason for the observed haplotypes distribution pattern is that diversity within populations is extremely low and differentiation among populations is high. with the exception of the population nzd, the populations have no haplotype and nucleotide polymorphism. this is because that missing haplotypes in the network are due to the species’ long evolutionary history during which climate variations, geological activities, and human activities formed the several scattered populations that currently exist.

understanding a species’ demographic history aids in understanding its ancient evolutionary environment. quaternary glaciers are known to have profoundly affected the distribution of plant species  <cit> . previous studies have shown that different plant species had different responses to glacial and interglacial influences. most plant taxa are believed to have shifted the latitude or elevation of their ranges in response to glaciation  <cit> . some plant species, e.g., taxus wallichiana <cit> , c. revoluta and c. taitungensis <cit> , experienced population expansion during the most recent glacial period, and others, e.g., c. debaoensis <cit> , showed population contraction. although there is growing evidence for population demographic stability or expansion throughout the last glacial maximum  in a range of different organisms  <cit> , c. simplicipinna appears to have exhibited population demographic contraction during the lgm and no later expansion. we infer this from the bayesian skyline plot , a divergence of the observed mismatch distribution from the expected distribution . the significant positive values of ssd and raggedness and non-significant positive fu’s fs  also imply c. simplicipinna did not undergo a population expansion, so it maybe undergo a population contraction or stay a population dynamic equilibrium. bottleneck analysis  showed that populations of c. simplicipinna have not experienced recent bottleneck event but a reduction in population size, which was in accord with bayesian skyline plot . the divergence times of c. simplicipinna haplotypes fall generally in the pleistocene. we therefore conclude that c. simplicipinna was widely and continuously distributed before the glacials and contracted into several isolated surviving populations during the glacials. refugium populations typically have relatively high genetic diversity and unique haplotypes  <cit> . in our study, c. simplicipinna had high genetic diversity at the species level. each of its population had a unique haplotype for the cpdna data but low level genetic diversity. the existing c. simplicipinna populations are distributed mainly in the tropics or subtropics. because they are adapted to warm temperatures, temperature is the main factor affecting their growth. the average annual temperature in chinese subtropical and tropical areas during the last glacial maximum was 4-6°c lower than it is today, which caused change and migration in vegetation  <cit> . this could have had a strong influence on the distribution of c. simplicipinna. the low ice age temperatures were not suitable for c. simplicipinna, which led to decline or even local extinction of populations. some cpdna and nuclear haplotypes were lost in the process, leading us to deduce that the present areas of distribution are its ice age glacial refugia. cycas simplicipinna migrated to the scatter refugia that form its haplotypes current distribution pattern. they did not migrate to a common refugium during the quaternary glacial period but instead survived in their original locales.

we conclude that the reduction in effective population size and limited gene flow were the main factors promoting genetic differentiation among populations of c. simplicipinna, which in turn led to the current population structure and distribution pattern.

conservation implications
one goal for the conservation of threatened plants is to maintain the genetic diversity of native plant species  <cit> . ex situ collections are also important because they provide a setting for breeding for introduction, which is an important way to increase the genetic diversity of native plant populations. we found that three  of our seven study populations were distributed in protection zones in which there has been no overexploitation and habitat destruction. however, the other four populations  occur outside of protected areas and should be protected. our study, which revealed a clear population structure of c. simplicipinna that show low genetic variation within populations and high genetic differentiation among populations, has significant implications for conservation of this species. the population structure and demographic history of c. simplicipinna imply that conservation efforts cannot focus on only one part of the species’ range. we suggest that habitat protection be strengthened immediately by establishing protection zones or plots in the distribution areas of c. simplicipinna to improve the conservation awareness of local farmers and to prohibit deforestation in cycas distribution areas. protection of populations with the highest genetic diversity, such as populations nzd and lua, should be of highest priority. priority should also be given to populations with unique haplotypes. based on the analysis of the two cpdna sequences in our study, six of the seven sampled populations of c. simplicipinna each had one unique cpdna haplotype. therefore, every c. simplicipinna population should be given maximum protection to prevent losing any haplotypes. the reduction of effective population size in the ice age has led to a small effective population size for the species as a whole, which jeopardizes the species’ current genetic diversity. different populations and/or individuals should be moved from current areas of rich genetic diversity to secure remote areas for ex situ conservation. these measures taken together could protect and enrich the genetic diversity of c. simplicipinna.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that this cycas species underwent a past population contraction during pleistocene with high genetic differentiation among populations and a clear genetic structure. in addition, unique haplotype was detected in all populations in this study. these populations need to be protected for sustaining high genetic diversity in c. simplicipinna. furthermore, the reconstruction of population demographic history in c. simplicipinna provides insights and guidelines for protecting c. simplicipinna and other endangered cycas species effectively.
