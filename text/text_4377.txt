BACKGROUND
wide hybridization is a common phenomenon in plant evolution that has made a great contribution to the improvement of crops by transferring many desired traits from wild species to crops, such as rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , and sun-flower  <cit> . moreover, the significantly different phenotypes between the reciprocal hybrids have been well documented in several different plant species. for example, an earlier study using arabidopsis thaliana as a maternal parent and a. arenosa as a paternal parent showed that many live seeds were produced, though the reciprocal hybrids could not be obtained  <cit> . in some cases, vigour is different between reciprocal hybrids, such as between a. thaliana ecotypes c <dig> and col- <dig>  <cit> . despite ample experimental evidence for the occurrence of this phenomenon, many different mechanisms, including parent-origin effects  <cit> , dosage-sensitive regulators  <cit> , gene imprinting  <cit> , transposable elements activated  <cit> , cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction  <cit> , maternal effects  <cit> , cytoplasmic inheritance  <cit> , the dominance model  <cit> , overdominant effects and epistasis  <cit> , have been proposed to understand the different phenotypes between reciprocal hybrids.

previous studies have shown that epigenetic modifications, especially those involving small rnas, are a main factor for the development and growth of plants. therefore, we speculate the intriguing possibility that epigenetic modifications may play an important role in different phenotypes between reciprocal hybrids. small rnas including mirnas and sirnas, which function as mediators and regulators, play an extensive role in epigenetic processes and gene expression. for example, 24-nt sirnas can mediate dna methylation and the silencing of transposons  <cit> , and 21-nt sirnas and mirnas can regulate the gene expression levels through cleaving target genes  <cit> . according to previous studies, hybridization may induce changes in small rnas  <cit> . in addition, li  <cit>  found that the change in small rnas by grafting  could result in the phenotypic variations. however, less is known about what happens to epigenetics between the reciprocal hybrids, and how epigenetics may affect the gene expression and phenotypes of reciprocal hybrids. therefore, finding the differences in small rnas after hybridization and how these small rnas regulate gene expression and subsequent phenotypes between reciprocal hybrids is worth exploring.

tomato is a model plant and a very important economic vegetable crop  <cit> . wild tomatoes contain a higher nutrition quality and more disease-resistance genes and also exhibit a higher feasibility to cross with cultivated tomatoes  <cit> . distant hybridization is usually applied to incorporate these preferable traits from wild tomatoes into the cultivars for genetic improvements. in the present study, a reciprocal cross between the cultivar and wild tomato was first established to determine whether different phenotypes between the reciprocal hybrids exist. second, based on the different phenotypes, small rnas were analysed by high-throughput sequencing to explore any differences between reciprocal hybrids. third, the expression of predicted target genes corresponding to differentially expressed mirnas was analysed by qrt-pcr to observe the correlation between genes and phenotypes. these results suggest that small rnas may be responsible for the phenotypic variations in reciprocal hybrids.

RESULTS
phenotypic analysis of the reciprocal hybrids and their parents
to find out whether there are different phenotypes between the reciprocal hybrids of the distant hybridization, the reciprocal cross between solanum lycopersicum cv. micro-tom and s. pimpinellifolium line wva <dig> was performed, and the phenotypic characterizations of the hybrids were analysed . the data showed that micro-tom × wva <dig> had larger leaf area, crown width and smaller fruit shape index than their parents, whereas longer leaf length and smaller fruit shape index were found in wva700 × micro-tom when compared with parents . in addition, the results also showed that micro-tom × wva <dig> exhibited significantly larger fruit shape index and smaller single fruit weight and plant height compared with wva700 × micro-tom . therefore, phenotypes of fruit shape index, single fruit weight and plant height were dramatically different between the reciprocal hybrids.figure  <dig>

small rnas sequencing in reciprocal hybrids and their progenitors
mature small rnas are generated in the cytoplasm; therefore small rnas in reciprocal hybrids with different cytoplasms were analysed by high-throughput sequencing to determine whether there are differences between them and explore the relationship of small rnas with gene expression and phenotypes in the reciprocal hybrids. four separate small rna libraries  were generated and their sequencing data have been deposited into the sra database of ncbi with accession number srx <dig>  srx <dig>  srx <dig> and srx <dig>  respectively.

a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads were obtained from leaf libraries of micro-tom, wva <dig>  micro-tom × wva <dig> and wva700 × micro-tom, respectively, after eliminating reads without srna sequences ranging from  <dig> to 30 nt in length . the length distribution was primarily 20–24 nt, in which 21 nt and 24 nt lengths were most abundant at approximately 16% and 45%, respectively. compared to wva700 × micro-tom, 21 nt and 24 nt srnas in micro-tom × wva <dig> were more abundant. among all four types of tomatoes, the accumulation of 24 nt srnas was higher than that of 21 nt srnas.

analysis of the repeat-associated sirnas
a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clean reads were obtained from micro-tom, wva <dig>  micro-tom × wva <dig> and wva700 × micro-tom, respectively, including mirna, rrna, repeat, snrna and others . note that the top four of the repeat-associate sirnas were matched on the sequences of ltr in both the unique tags and total tags. surprisingly, all four types of repeat-associate sirnas accumulated to lower levels in wva700 × micro-tom relative to those in micro-tom × wva <dig> . sirna is derived from repetitive sequences, mediates rna-dependent dna methylation and is important in gene expression. thus, the differences in abundance of repeat-associate sirna may influence the chromatin stability and gene expression of reciprocal hybrids.

analysis of known mirnas between reciprocal hybrids
known mirnas were found by the mirbase tool. after searching the sequences,  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> families were detected . moreover, the abundance of each family was analysed . a dramatic difference was found between the abundances of different families. the reads of four families  were significantly higher than those of other families. interestingly, compared with wva700 × micro-tom, the abundance of mirnas in the four families of micro-tom × wva <dig> were higher, indicating that the mirnas of the four families may be fundamental and indispensable factors for plant growth and development in tomato and may contribute to the different gene expressions between the reciprocal hybrids.

to explore the different influences of mirnas on phenotypes between reciprocal hybrids, differentially expressed known mirnas were analysed by the approach of hierarchical cluster . the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> conserved and  <dig> non-conserved mirnas were highly variable between the reciprocal hybrids, and a total of  <dig> mirnas displayed a greater than four-fold change . among them, the expression of  <dig> mirnas in micro-tom × wva <dig> were higher than those of wva700 × micro-tom, such as conserved mirnas  and non-conserved mir <dig> that showed similar expression levels between micro-tom and wva <dig>  the expression levels of the other  <dig> mirnas, including mir482c, mir394a, mir535b, mir169b, mir <dig>  mir393a, mir160a and mir165a, were obviously lower in micro-tom × wva <dig>  hence, the differentially expressed mirnas may be relevant to significantly different phenotypes between reciprocal hybrids.figure  <dig>

to validate the different levels of mirna expression,  <dig> conserved mirnas were tested in quantitative experiments by stem-loop rt-pcr. the results of the quantitative experiments were consistent with the sequencing data .figure  <dig>

the prediction of target genes of differently expressed mirnas
the target genes of differently expressed mirnas were predicted to elucidate the relationship between mirnas and phenotypes.

a total of  <dig> target genes for  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were predicted. the gene functions of these targets were determined by gene ontology  annotation and involved biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions . the top three biological processes were metabolic processes , cellular processes  and response to stimuli . moreover, those target genes were primarily located within the cell, cell parts and organelles at 29%, 29% and 23%, respectively. in addition, 50% of target genes for molecular function were attributed to binding and 39% were attributed to catalytic activity, indicating that those targets may be involved in many metabolic processes and that there may be complicated relationships between those targets and different phenotypes.figure  <dig>

to interpret the possible specific relationships of the targets and different phenotypes between the reciprocal hybrids, the quantitative rt-pcr analysis was used to measure the expression levels of six predicted target genes that are involved in the development of leaves, including arf <dig> , hd-zip , auxin f-box protein , and f-box protein   <cit> , the development of fruits, including sbp   <cit> , and plant height, including scl   <cit>  . the results showed that the expression levels of sbp and scl were higher in wva700 × micro-tom than those of micro-tom × wva <dig>  whereas arf <dig>  hd-zip, auxin f-box protein and f-box protein were lower in wva700 × micro-tom. therefore, the expression levels of target genes were negatively correlated with the abundances of their corresponding mirnas in this study.figure  <dig>

discussion
different phenotypes in reciprocal hybrids have been well documented in several different plant species. in the present study, a significantly larger fruit shape index and smaller single fruit weight and plant height was found in micro-tom × wva <dig> compared with wva700 × micro-tom. therefore, understanding how different phenotypes occur after reciprocal cross is important.

different profiles of 24-nt srnas in reciprocal hybrids
mirnas are often 21 nt or 22 nt in length, whereas sirnas are 24 nt length  <cit> . in the present study, the top two abundant srnas were mirnas  and sirnas  as determined by high-throughput sequencing, which is similar to a previous study on the tomato plant that showed that 24-nt srnas accumulated more than 21-nt srnas  <cit> .

from the length distribution of srnas, 24-nt srnas were present in the highest proportion of the total srnas, ranging from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  , and the trend was consistent with the total dna methylation levels in reciprocal hybrids. the results also showed that the total dna methylation levels in micro-tom × wva <dig> were insignificantly higher than that of wva700 × micro-tom . hence, the different profiles of 24-nt srnas may influence the expression of associated genes to regulate the phenotypes. furthermore, among the top four repeat-associate sirnas, all matched to an ltr  that had higher levels in micro-tom × wva <dig> than those of wva700 × micro-tom . moreover, the ltr can be reactivated by interspecific hybridization, which has been demonstrated in several previous studies  <cit> . therefore, we deduced that the different reactivity of ltr regulated by different profiles of repeat-associate sirnas may influence the phenotypic variation between reciprocal hybrids.

different phenotypes may be caused by differently expressed mirnas
previous studies have reported that gene regulation through sequence specific interactions between mirnas and their target genes can affect plant growth and development. in a previous study, the loss-of-function mutant of arf <dig>  was used to find intriguing phenotypes in the leaf  <cit> , suggesting that different expression levels may influence the development of the leaf. moreover, by targeting hd-zip, auxin f-box proteins, f-box protein genes, and mirnas, including mir165a, mir393a and mir394a, also regulate the development of the leaf and make a contribution to the construction of leaf morphology  <cit> . in this study, the significantly different phenotypes of leaf area and leaf length between the hybrids and the parents were displayed. meanwhile, the expressions of mir160a, mir165a, mir393a and mir394a showed dramatically different profile between the reciprocal hybrids. in addition, the fruit of micro-tom × wva <dig> had less single fruit weight , whereas mir156f-3p had significantly higher levels of expression in micro-tom × wva <dig> compared with those of wva700 × micro-tom . one possibility is that the increased accumulation of mir <dig> led to a decrease in the expression of sbp that influenced fruit weight, which was confirmed in transgenic tomato plants  <cit> . furthermore, scarecrow-likea , which is the target of mir <dig>  was involved in plant height  <cit> . a significantly different plant height and the expression level of mir171a-3p were found in this study. in summary, the expression levels of mirnas and target genes in reciprocal hybrids differ with different phenotypes. therefore, the expression of mirnas that negatively regulate their targets may contribute to different phenotypes between reciprocal hybrids during distant hybridization.

in conclusion, the primary feature of reciprocal hybrids is that they have same nuclear genomes, but their cytoplasm and epigenomes may be quite different. attributing the different phenotypes between reciprocal hybrids solely to one factor does not aid in understanding the underlying possible molecular mechanisms behind these differences. in the present study, small rnas including mirnas and sirnas exhibited differences between reciprocal hybrids. accounting for the different patterns of mature small rnas between reciprocal hybrids, the different modifications of mirna genes may be the cause of these different phenotypes due to the different epigenomes. in the cytoplasm, the single mature mirnas are loaded into the rna induced silencing complex to guide mrna cleavage  <cit> . in addition, in a previous study, lu et al. reported that maternal sirnas can regulate the seed size in reciprocal crosses  <cit> . therefore, the different cytoplasm from different maternal parents may also influence the effects of small rnas on regulating the development of plant. in summary, further research is needed to gain a better understanding of how different profiles of small rnas occur in reciprocal hybrids.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that the profiles of small rnas differed between the reciprocal hybrids, and differentially expressed genes were also observed based on the different phenotypes. the qrt-pcr results of target genes showed that differentially expressed mirnas negatively regulated their target genes. moreover, the expression of target genes was well correlated with the observations of different phenotypes. these findings may aid in elucidating small rnas contribute significantly to different phenotypes through epigenetic modification during reciprocal crossing.
