BACKGROUND
the most widely studied epigenetic modification in humans is cytosine methylation at cpg dinucleotides. computational analysis predictions have indicated there are about  <dig>  cpg islands in the human genome  <cit> . approximately 70% of cpg dinucleotides in mammals are methylated and found in repetitive elements  <cit>  whereas most cpg islands with relative high densities of unmehylated cpg dinucleotides are located at the promoter region of house-keeping genes and tumor suppressor genes and play important roles in gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation  <cit> . additionally, researchers have found that dna methylation changes occur in human cancers  <cit> , and researches in this area have established that hypermethylation of cpg islands tends to silence tumor suppressor genes and that hypomethylation activates oncogenes  <cit> .

many approaches for detecting dna methylation are done in a gene-specific manner, such as bisulfite treatment of dna combined with sequencing, amplification by methylation-specific pcr, or restriction enzyme-based digestion. these techniques are limited to study known candidate genes. recent advances in dna sequencing methods have now allowed genome-wide dna methylation studies. however, even with the use of cost-effective next-generation sequencing technologies to carry out these analyses  <cit> , there is still heavy reliance on high cost and high computational load of bioinformatics analyses, making sequencing methods still of limited application. alternative genome-wide dna methylation methods based on microarray technologies have proven to be useful. additionally, due to the methylation patterns of the human genome described above, inclusion of a methylation enrichment approach can be extremely useful for detecting genome-wide dna methylation patterns and changes.

the most popular genome-wide methylated dna enrichment studies include approaches based on methylation-sensitive restriction-enzyme digestion. these include the following: differential methylation hybridization , which is a method for comparing the methylation status of cpg islands between test samples and control samples  <cit>  and are widely used  <cit> . microarray-based methylation assessment of single samples , which utilizes methylation-sensitive and methylation-dependent enzyme digestion for within-sample comparison of methylation level of cpg island  loci  <cit> . affinity purification by methylcytosine dna-binding domain  protein, which uses an mbd-domain-conjugated column to purify methylated dna fragments for dna methylation assessment  <cit> . immunoprecipitation of dna using an antibody that recognizes 5'-methyl cytosine   <cit> , which was demonstrated to be more sensitive than mbd purification for detecting methylated dna  <cit> . more approaches have also been developed recently  <cit> .

although the above global methylated dna enrichment assays have demonstrated widespread utility, a systematic analysis of the sensitivity and accuracy of each of these assays has not been performed. in addition, within each method there is considerable variation in the use of each of the experimental parameters, which are important for enhancing the performance and many of them have not been adequately explored. thus, a systematic evaluation of different approaches for genome-wide methylated dna enrichment with optimized experimental parameters is necessary.

in this study, we set about to optimize several of the experimental parameters in these methodologies, and then we followed this up by performing a direct comparison between dmh, mmass, and medip. we additionally assessed potential reasons that underlie the variability in these assays. our work provides the first results for evaluating these widely used enrichment assays, which will be useful for accurately analyzing the methylome in the epigenomics field.

RESULTS
evaluation of the quality of human  <dig> k cgi array
as a first step for our analyses, we assessed the quality of our human  <dig> k cgi array  as well as the consistency of our labeling. we hybridized two independently labeled aliquots  of sonicated genomic dna with cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorescent dyes, respectively. an ma plot of background-corrected and normalized log <dig> signal versus log <dig> differential signal from both the cy <dig> and cy <dig> channels is shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s1-a. the signal consistency of two channels was very high with > <dig> % of cgi probes showing <2-fold differential expression , and the signal from the two channels manifesting a strong correlation , confirming that our array was of high quality for use in the following experiments.

optimization of experimental parameters in dmh, mmass, and medip
dmh, mmass, and medip all have several parameters that can impact the quality of the results. to provide an assessment of the importance of each parameter and their impact on the experimental results, we investigated and optimized the primary parameters that could impact the results in these analyses. for dmh and mmass assays, where the digested dna products are amplified using pcr, the impact of annealing temperature in the pcr amplification of the digested products was assessed, and for medip we looked at the incubation time of the 5-methylcytosine antibodies and secondary antibody during immunoprecipitation.

methylation profiling of the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line mgc- <dig> was carried out using our human  <dig> k cgi array. the dna products, derived from methylation sensitive restriction enzymes bstui and hpaii , and the methylation-dependent enzyme mcrbc-digestion respectively, were pcr-amplified using three different annealing temperatures, i.e. 65ºc  <cit> ,  <dig> °c , and 72°c  <cit> . we then hybridized equal amounts of the probe on the cgi array for within-sample comparison of methylation levels. our results revealed that pcr-amplification at different annealing temperatures produced different methylation patterns after hybridization. additional file  <dig>  figure s1-b shows that the array with an annealing temperature of 72°c had a higher total intensity and than the other two. given this temperature providing the strongest signal, all the following dmh and mmass experiments used 72°c as the optimal temperature for pcr amplification.

as antibody incubation time played a crucial role in the binding efficiency and specificity of methylated dna fragments, to assess the specificity and efficiency of the methylated dna fragment in medip, we utilized two sets of external dna controls from yeast genomic dna, which had no significant homology with human and mouse genomic dna sequence by blast , and each of the external dna control was composed of methylated and unmethylated dna fragments with a set ratio  for assessment of optimized incubation time of anti-5-methylcytosine mouse mab and sheep anti-mouse igg using a microarray-based methylation profiling study. the first tested condition employed anti-5-methylcytosine mouse mab with a  <dig> hr incubation time followed by incubation with sheep anti-mouse igg for  <dig> hrs, as described previously  <cit> . the results showed that the hybridization ratio of ip compared to input of all the controls was much lower than the theoretical ratio, indicating that the methylated dna binding with anti-5-methylcytosine mouse mab antibody was incomplete ). we then increased the time of anti-5-methylcytosine mouse mab incubation to  <dig> hrs and found that the binding efficiency of external controls increased but still remained lower than the theoretical ratio shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> .

next the impact of the incubation time of the secondary antibody sheep anti-mouse igg at  <dig> hr,  <dig> hrs,  <dig> hrs, and  <dig> hrs, was investigated respectively. the results showed the captured amount of methylated dna increased with longer incubation time of the secondary antibody. however, nonspecific binding of unmethylated dna fragments also rose ). nevertheless, the growth tendency showed the deviation of each external control from theoretical ratio was lowest around  <dig> hours. the results demonstrated that the optimal conditions for methylated dna enrichment in medip was a 12-hr incubation with the primary antibody followed by a 3-hr incubation with the secondary antibody. these optimized conditions were used in all following medip experiments.

we also used our dna external controls to evaluate the deviation of methylated dna enrichment among dmh-v <dig>  mmass-v <dig>  and medip . our data showed that the deviation from the theoretical ratio of all external dna controls was lowest for medip ). this indicates that whole genome amplification after digestion in dmh and mmass may introduce pcr bias; thus, it is important when using those two assays to take this into consideration for evaluating results.

systematic comparison of dmh, mmass, and medip
after optimization of the above parameters for better performance for all three methods, a systematic evaluation of dmh, mmass, and medip was carried out using human  <dig> k cpg microarray for detecting differential methylation profiling of the gastric epithelium cell line ges- <dig> and the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line mgc- <dig> 

we first compared dmh and mmass, both of which are based on restriction enzyme digestion. dmh typically employed methylation-sensitive enzyme digestion to enrich the methylated dna fraction for between-samples comparison  <cit> , whereas, mmass used methylation-sensitive and methylation-dependent enzymes digestion for within-sample comparison  <cit> .

to evaluate mmass and dmh assays, mcrbc  <cit>  was used to restrict samples for the representation of unmethylated sequences; the combination of bstui and hpaii   <cit>  and the combination of acii, hinp1i, hpych4iv and hpaii   <cit>  were two sets of methylation-sensitive enzymes. both sets of methylation-sensitive enzymes  were able to interrogate more than 90% cgi probes on our array, with v <dig> as high as  <dig> % . as seen from the ma and volcano plots, differential expression , statistical b value, and log2fold change of mmass were much higher than dmh for both v <dig> and v <dig> enzyme sets . these data indicate that mmass has a higher sensitivity than dmh. in addition, mmass had a higher number of significant candidates  than did dmh : mmass-v <dig> selected  <dig> differential candidates and mmass-v <dig> had 512; whereas dmh-v <dig> selected  <dig> and dmh-v <dig> had  <dig>  the overlap in candidates between dmh and mmass using enzyme set v <dig> and set v <dig> was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. most of differential candidates detected in dmh were also selected by mmass, but mmass characterized an additional number of unique candidates .

* percent coverage of cpgs in the whole genome cited from schumacher et al.,  <dig>  nucleic acids reaserach,  <dig>  528- <dig>  which was based on a representative  <dig> kb of genomic dna derived from the chromosome  <dig> comt region.

the total number of clones on the array was  <dig> and the total number of cpgs in the clones on the array was  <dig> 

 <dig> all covered means the clones cover at least one combined enzymes site.

 <dig> overlapped covered means clones cover all combined enzymes sites.

to validate the accuracy of the results from the two methods, we used bisulfite sequencing to confirm methylation statue difference in ges and  <dig> from the unique targets in mmass-v <dig> and dmh-v <dig>  and the common targets from both. for this, we randomly tested  <dig> of the unique mmass-v <dig> targets ,  <dig> of the unique dmh-v <dig> targets , and  <dig> of the candidates common to both , and obtained validation of  <dig> % of the unique mmass-v <dig> candidates,  <dig> % of the unique dmh-v <dig>  and  <dig> % of the candidates common to both ). similar results also could be obtained from v <dig> set of enzymes that the true positive rates are  <dig> % in mmass-v <dig> unique and  <dig> % in common. thus, the data from the bisulfite sequencing validation indicates that both sensitivity and accuracy in mmass was higher than the ones in dmh. although it has been reported that the comparison of methylated to unmethylated dna within sample in mmass would amplify the fold change and b value, based on our validation data, the results are relatively reliable.

we also compared results between mmass with medip, for which, respectively, enrichment is based on methylation-sensitive and -dependent enzymes digestion, and on immunoprecipitation of methylated dna. the ma and volcano plots of these two assays showed significantly higher differential expression , statistical b value, and fold change in mmass for both v <dig> or v <dig> set of enzymes as compared to medip, indicating that the sensitivity of mmass assay is greater than medip. additionally, mmass also identified more candidates showing differential expression compared to medip . although enzyme digestion assays do have restriction-site limitations, since even with several enzymes combined the whole genome cgi cannot be covered , the mmass assay still shows an overall better sensitivity than the other two, indicating it likely provides a better representation of the methylation status of target dna.

we also evaluated the accuracy of the two assays by testing  <dig> candidates from unique to mmass-v <dig> ,  <dig> candidates unique to medip , and  <dig> candidates shared by both  methods for bisulfite sequencing. the resulting data showed that the true positive rates were  <dig> % for those unique to mmass-v <dig>   <dig> % for those unique to medip, and  <dig> % for those in common between the two methods ). although the sensitivity of mmass was much higher than medip, the accuracy of both assays was similar.

considering that medip approach employed klenow for amplification of purified methylated dna fragment, it generally has lower amplification efficiency compared with the pcr based amplification employed in dmh and mmass. therefore we suspected that the lower sensitivity in medip is due to the low abundance of tested dna amplicon in medip, which can not be detected by array. under such perspective, we assessed the efficiency of immunoprecipitation. we used quantitative pcr analysis on  <dig> randomly selected differential methylated probes in the mgc- <dig> cell line that were validated by bisulfite sequencing as targets, and the results  showed that medip enriched the majority of the hypermethylated dna fragments several fold relative to an equal amount of input dna. we also assessed the enrichment level of these differential methylated clones in the ges- <dig> cell line, and the methylation level of ges- <dig> compared to mgc- <dig> was consistent with the results obtained using mmass-v <dig> but was very low for medip  . based on these findings, the methylation difference of cgi between the two samples was likely due to the inability of medip enrichment to be thoroughly using cgi array based technology. given this, we decreased the threshold of the b value to obtain a larger number of differential candidates from the results of medip. with the b value cutoff decreased to - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  the number of identified differential probes increased to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively ; nevertheless, the relative overlap percentage of medip with both mmass-v <dig> and mmass-v <dig> decreased gradually . furthermore, we validated the accuracy of newly covered unique differential probes from medip with b value cutoff decreased through bisulfite sequencing. the results demonstrated that the true positive rate is  <dig> % with - <dig> <b value <  <dig> which is similar with  <dig> % of b value >  <dig>  but it sharply descends to  <dig> % as - <dig> <b value < - <dig> . therefore, a slight decrease in the b value can compensate for deficiencies the array allowing detection of more differential candidates without substantially affecting accuracy.

discussion
genomic profiling of methylated and unmethylated sequences using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion or 5'-methylcytosine antibody immunoprecipitation combined with hybridization to microarrays is a potentially powerful and expedient method. however, in contrast to work performed on expression microarray data, so far there has been no detailed assessment of the effects of different parameters or of enrichment assays on the overall results from these methods. here, we optimized several important parameters to enhance the efficiency of enrichment, and elucidated the sensitivity and specificity of methylation-restriction enzyme-digestion-based methods and 5'-methylcytosine immunoprecipitation-based enrichment methods.

our data showed that the sensitivity of dmh is less than that of mmass, whereas dmh is complementary to mmass. mmass when used in combination with cgi array detection provided the best results for both the sensitivity and accuracy of the three different methylation profiling approaches when using a b value cutoff  <dig>  the results when using methylated dna as compared to unmethylated dna in mmass also increased the sensitivity of differential methylation detection, and this was primarily because both methylation sensitive and methylation-dependent enzymes are complementary in their ability to identify differential methylation levels in cgi. however, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes were not able to interrogate every cytosine, and, even when using a combination of four enzymes, more than half of the cpg sites of the genome were missed. thus, in mmass, many of the differential cgis ranked very low as candidates; these candidates, however, could be detected using medip.

the above is likely due to the fact that 5'-methylcytosine antibody binds to methylated dna throughout the entire genome, making it potentially a better method for detecting genome-wide methylation changes; however, it still has serious limitation in that, whereas it can easily detect methylated dna where there are two or three methyl moieties per molecular, dna with only one methyl group is insufficient for detection  <cit> . methylated dna enrichment could potentially aid in overcoming this issue, and our assessment of medip did illustrate that such low copy cgis could be enriched through immunoprecipitaton, they were poorly detected by the cgi array. using a slightly lower b value cut-off did compensate for this, but lowering the cutoff too far had a drastic negative impact on specificity. thus, only with very careful adjustment of specific parameters, could medip achieve similar sensitivity and specificity to mmass. it should also be noted that our study was performed for cpg islands, hence in cpg-poor regions the performance of the compared methods might differ.

this last finding indicated that, because such care is needed in setting the parameters for medip to obtain good sensitivity without extensive loss of accuracy, that use of more sensitive detection technology such as next generation sequencing   <cit> , rather than array technology would make this an excellent method for getting at the methylation status of the entire genome. genome-scale methylation profiling with bisulfite sequencing has been successfully performed in arabidopsis and mammalian cell line  <cit> . additionally, restriction enzymes have been combined with direct sequencing to determine global methylation patterns in human brain dna  <cit> . with the development of high throughput sequencing, it is expected that whole genome methylome sequencing will become an even more effective strategy for whole epigenomic analysis. on the other hand, it should also be noted that although ngs technology with platform such as illumina genome analyzer is not strictly restricted by abundance of dna fragments and is able to provide whole genome methylation profile at single-nucleotide base resolution, currently the high cost and high computational load of bioinformatics analysis make it still of limited application. microarray-based technology as we utilized in this work technically requires high abundance of dna fragments to ensure high signal intensity needed for array and can not reach the resolution of single-nucleotide base, while it has been well-established with low cost and mature bioinformatics strategies and is especially applicable to detect methylation profile of specific regions of interest . thus, ngs and microarray dna methylation profiling methods are expected to co-exist to fulfill the demands of different researches in future  <cit> . the enrichment methods we evaluated in our work could be employed to enrich specific methylated genomic regions of interest for both microarray technology and ngs technology to investigate dna methylation profiling.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that assays based on methylation-sensitive enzyme digestion and those based on immunoprecipitation detected different methylated dna fragments, indicating that they are complementary in their relative ability to detect methylation differences. our study provides the first comprehensive evaluation for widely used methodologies for methylated dna enrichment, and could be helpful for developing a cost effective approach for dna methylation profiling.
