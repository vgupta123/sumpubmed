BACKGROUND
xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, a yellow-pigmented gram-negative bacterium, is the causal agent of bacterial blight disease of rice  plants. x. oryzae pv. oryzae infection can cause yield loss of up to 50% in tropical asia  <cit> . x. oryzae pv. oryzae infects rice leaves through natural openings such as hydathodes and/or wounded sites and then primarily colonizes the vascular tissues by propagating in the xylem. increased extracellular polysaccharide secretion accompanies bacteria growth, eventually causing a block in the vascular system  <cit> . the early symptoms therefore start with wilting in the infected leaves and enlargement in length and width of the legions of leaf blight  <cit> . as the symptom progress, severe necrosis occurs along the interveinal regions. eventually, the whole leaf becomes whitish and greyish, and then dies  <cit> . over the last few decades, the challenge in elucidating biological phenomena has been met by advances in techniques, which have accelerated our understanding of biological events. in particular, useful tools have been developed to evaluate cellular dynamics in vivo. one of the best examples of a technique that has facilitated cell-based studies is marker systems that use fluorescent proteins . since the green fluorescent protein  was first discovered from the jellyfish aequorea victoria in  <dig>  <cit> , various types of fps, including red, yellow, and cyanine fluorescent proteins, have been developed and used in fields such as biophysics, biochemistry, and plant pathology  <cit> . the proteins are stable  <cit> , non-species specific  <cit> , and have no requirement of specific substrate  <cit> . therefore, labelling a specific target protein with a fp is a powerful molecular tool for a cell biology study since it provides the ability to visualize, track, and quantify targets in living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution essential features for understanding biology systems  <cit> . in addition, bimolecular fluorescence complementation  analysis using split-fp systems has been successfully applied to determine protein-protein interactions in planta as well as in animals  <cit> . recently, fps have been used for monitoring living organisms such as lactobacillus sakie, pseudomonas syringae, x. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae, and xylella fastidiosa in their hosts  <cit> .

to determine virulence and pathogenicity of bacterial pathogens in plant-microbe interactions, researchers typically quantify bacterial multiplication in planta by counting the number of bacterial colonies in plate assays of leaf extracts  <cit> . this method consists of leaf harvesting, tissue maceration, colony plating, incubating, and counting of bacterial cells. these methods are time-consuming and labour intensive, especially for slow-growing bacteria like x. oryzae pv. oryzae. in addition, the results frequently show large amounts of variation depending on experimental conditions.

here, we provide an improved method for the study of x. oryzae pv. oryzae using a fluorescent marker system. it not only eliminates many of the difficulties of conventional methods but also allows for reliable and rapid monitoring of bacteria in planta prior to the formation of symptoms.

RESULTS
generation of x. oryzae pv. oryzae expressing gfp
x. oryzae pv. oryzae philippine race  <dig>  carrying the gfp gene was generated using ppneo-gfp, which is a new construct based on the broad-host-range probe vector, pprobe-gfp  <cit>  and the pml <dig> vector  <cit> . the pprobe-gfp plasmid was previously used as a marker to assess expression of genes of interest in xyllela festidosa and x. campestris pv. campestris  <cit> . the neomycin promoter in pml <dig> was successfully used for protein expression in x. oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> . to generate a plasmid, ppneo-gfp, which is approximately  <dig> nucleotides long and contains the neomycin promoter, was taken from the pml <dig> plasmid and ligated into a pprobe-gfp vector. the modified construct was introduced into pxo <dig> wild type strain and transformants were selected on peptone sucrose agar  plate containing kanamycin  for selection of ppneo-gfp. expression of gfp in the transformants was tested by western-blot analysis using an anti-gfp antibody . x. oryzae pv. oryzae carrying ppneo-gfp  showed strong fluorescence . our results demonstrate that the pxo99gfp strain carrying the ppneo-gfp vector constitutively and strongly expresses gfp in x. oryzae pv. oryzae, suggesting that the marker system might be applied to study plant-microbe interactions in planta.

the pxo99gfp strain is useful for studies of x. oryzae pv. oryzae pathogenesis
first, we examined whether the ppneo-gfp vector/plasmid had an affect on the pathogenicity and virulence of x. oryzae pv. oryzae in rice. the leaves from japonica rice varieties taipei  <dig>  and a transgenic line of tp <dig> expressing the xa <dig> resistance protein  were inoculated with the pxo <dig> or pxo99gfp strains using the scissor clipping method  <cit> . the typical inoculation symptoms were consistent between the pxo <dig> and pxo99gfp strains. in the susceptible line , lesions that developed were approximately  <dig> to  <dig> cm in length at  <dig> dpi, while lesions were less than  <dig> cm in the resistant line .  these results suggest that ppneo-gfp introduction into the pxo <dig> strain does not affect pathogenicity.

these results were also confirmed with bacterial growth in planta. to determine the multiplication of the pxo <dig> and pxo99gfp strains in planta, the bacteria were recovered from infected rice leaves at  <dig> dai, and dotted on psa plates. colonies were counted on psa plates containing cephalexin or kanamycin, an antibiotic for selection of xanthomonas spp. . cephalexin is appreciated as an antibiotic for selection of xanthomonas  <cit> . populations of the susceptible lines of both pxo <dig> and pxo99gfp strains increased by  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively, and both strains of the resistant lines increased by  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively. these results indicate that expression of gfp in the bacterium, x. oryzae pv. oryzae, has no effect not only in the phenotypic symptom but also on bacterial growth in planta.

bacteria have a tendency to lose exogenous plasmids in the absence of antibiotics  <cit> . we observed that ppneo-gfp in the pxo <dig> strain was not stable under non-selective conditions on ps medium without kanamycin . population increase was therefore measured on psa plates containing cephalexin/kanamycin  to examine the stability of ppneo-gfp under host conditions . surprisingly, the populations of the pxo99gfp strain at  <dig> days did not vary with or without the kanamycin antibiotics, indicating that the ppneo-gfp plasmid is stable during propagation under host conditions. recently, several reports showed similar phenomena that bacterial pathogens carry plasmid-borne fluorescent proteins in hosts. l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and l. fructosus expressing gfp on plasmid in chickens allowed to trace it in the gastro-intestinal tract using fluorescence microscopy  <cit> . another notable examples is x. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae strain containing p519ngfp plasmid  <cit> . this strain still showed and the fluorescence in the host, anthurium, even at  <dig> weeks after inoculation  <cit> . taken together, although it is poorly understood why bacterial pathogens carry exogenous plasmids under host conditions, plasmid-borne gfp should be useful tool for tracing pathogen in the host.

in order to investigate if there is a difference in the disease progress between the pxo <dig> and pxo99gfp strains, bacterial growth curves and lesion length development were established at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai . lesion lengths and bacterial populations at  <dig> and  <dig> dai were nearly identical between the strains, indicating that the continuously expressed gfp did not affect disease progress. tsuge, et al., reported that bioluminescent transconjugants of x. oryzae pv. oryzae were indistinguishable in pathogenicity with the parental strain  <cit> . to date, continuous fluorescence in bacteria did not alter the pathogenicity and virulence in the hosts. to apply our system with other patho-system, the stability of ppneo-gfp plasmid must be checked in planta growth.

we also confirmed the pathogenicity and virulence of the pxo99gfp strain and the stability of ppneo-gfp in the pxo99gfp strain using resistant and susceptible lines of kitaake, another japonica cultivar, that has emerged as a model variety for rice genomics analysis  <cit> . the results from the kitaake lines were consistent with the results from tp <dig> lines, showing that pxo99gfp strain had no detectable affect on the pathogenicity and virulence of the bacteria. these results suggest that the pxo99gfp strain can be used with various cultivars. taken together, our results indicate that the fluorescent x. oryzae pv. oryzae pxo99gfp strain with the ppneo-gfp plasmid is a useful tool for studies of pathogenesis.

visual observation of pxo99gfp in planta
we examined if the multiplication and colonization of bacteria can be visualized in rice leaf tissue. tp <dig> and tp309-xa <dig> were inoculated with the pxo99gfp strain, and then at  <dig> dai a small segment of the leaf five centimetres down from the inoculation site was harvested. the leaf tissue was cut into segments with a razor blade, and the transverse sections of the leaf were observed under a fluorescent microscope . fluorescence was detected at inoculation sites of both tp <dig> and tp309-xa <dig> . as expected, no fluorescent signal was observed in the xylem of the tp309-xa <dig> lines at the site apart from infection sites since the pxo99gfp strain could not spread through vascular systems in tp309-xa <dig> . on the other hand, the pxo99gfp strain propagated along vascular systems and was clearly observed in those of tp <dig> lines at the same position . these results demonstrate that the pxo99gfp strain proliferated in the susceptible lines but not in resistant lines and that the difference can easily be detected using fluorescent microscopy. our observation of pxo99gfp in the xylem is consistent with the findings of previous studies showing that x. oryzae pv. oryzae is a vascular pathogen  <cit> .

to test if pxo99gfp xylem colonization is detectable at the leaf surface without using a thin section, we examined the surface of the leaf every five-centimetres from the inoculation site . the fluorescent pxo99gfp strain was detected along the entire length of the leaf of susceptible tp <dig> lines in both vertical and transverse vascular bundles, even in symptomless regions that are  <dig> cm away from the inoculation site at  <dig> dpi . however, the fluorescence from the pxo99gfp strain in the resistant line, tp309-xa <dig>  was not detected even in the first five-centimeter region from inoculation site . this data shows that gfp can be used for efficient and rapid detection of x. oryzae pv. oryzae in planta. additionally, we tested bacterial migration along vascular system in tp <dig> and tp309-xa <dig> lines at earlier time . although lesion lengths were almost similar in both lines at  <dig> dai, bacterial migrations were clearly different. pxo99gfp strain migrated  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm from inoculation sites in tp <dig> and tp309-xa <dig>  respectively. these observations indicate that multiplication and localization of x. oryzae pv. oryzae in the rice vascular system occurs before typical disease symptoms, such as wilting and yellowing of leaf blades, can be detected . in other words, although disease symptoms are not clearly apparent at  <dig> dpi , bacterial localization can be determined . this result demonstrates that the pxo99gfp strain can be used to obtain an earlier diagnosis of infection compared to conventional methods.

quantification of pxo99gfp strain using a fluoremeter or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
to examine whether bacterial proliferation can be quantified using fluorescent microscopy, pxo <dig> wild type and pxo99gfp cells were recovered from inoculated rice leaves and measured. infection of pxo99gfp was clearly different between susceptible and resistant rice lines . at  <dig> days after infection, the fluorescence dramatically increased from  <dig> at  <dig> days to  <dig>  relative fluorescence units  in the susceptible line, tp <dig>  in the resistant line, tp309-xa <dig>  the fluorescence increased from  <dig> at day  <dig> to  <dig>  rfu. the non-gfp strain, pxo <dig>  also showed a low level of fluorescence that increased slightly by day  <dig>  which is attributed to  auto-fluorescence and not gfp from a bacterial population. these results suggest that measurements of bacterial multiplication using the pxo99gfp strain can replace the conventional colony counting method to screen for susceptible and resistant hosts.

the elisa  is widely used to quantify a particular protein. this method has been applied as a diagnostic tool to detect specific pathogen proteins in medicine and plant pathology  <cit> . to quantify the multiplication of the pxo99gfp strain in rice, elisa was carried out with anti-gfp antibody and the results were compared with the populations of the pxo99gfp strain at the indicated time points . pxo <dig> and pxo99gfp strains were harvested from tp <dig> and tp309-xa <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai. while the pxo <dig> strain showed a background absorbance level at all time points ), the pxo99gfp strain showed a temporal-dependent increase of gfp. the level of gfp expression in the resistant rice line was maintained with a gentle increase until  <dig> dai. interestingly, the gfp in the susceptible rice line, tp <dig>  increased after  <dig> dai and reached up to  <dig>  a <dig> at  <dig> dai. this increase of gfp observed in elisa correlated well with pxo99gfp population levels , indicating that the significant increase of gfp in rice is dependent on bacterial multiplication. because the fluorescent marker approach does not require diluting, incubating, and counting of bacterial cells, the method is  <dig> days faster than conventional measurement methods using plate assays. taken together, these results suggest that measurement of the bacterial fluorescence and gfp quantification by elisa are sensitive and rapid methods to determine growing bacterial population and host resistance compared to conventional methods.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we introduce an application of a fluorescent marker system for study of the phytopathogenic bacterium, x. oryzae pv. oryzae. the fluorescent x. oryzae pv. oryzae strain, pxo99gfp, facilitates detection of the invading pathogen. with this fluorescent marker system, bacterial population can be measured in a day, and resistant/susceptible lines can be screened at  <dig> dpi. this application, which may be used for other patho-systems, can reduce the time and effort required for bacterial growth determination compared to the conventional method.
