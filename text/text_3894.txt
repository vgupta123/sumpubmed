BACKGROUND
plant photosynthesis occurs in specialized organelles known as chloroplast where visible light is absorbed mainly by the pigment molecules chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids  <cit> . the reaction centres of psi and psii present in chloroplast thylakoids are the major sites of reactive oxygen species , which are partially reduced forms of molecular oxygen; e.g. superoxide radical , hydroxyl free radical , hydrogen peroxide  and singlet oxygen, formed during electron transport activities in the chloroplasts, mitochondria and plasma membrane  <cit> . photoreduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide  in psi was discovered in  <dig>  <cit> , and later, superoxide anion  was identified as the reduced product of molecular oxygen and superoxide dismutase , a key enzyme for the conversion of o2
.- to h2o <dig> and o <dig>  <cit> . h2o <dig> cannot accumulate in chloroplasts since it interferes with photosynthesis by rapidly oxidizing thiol-regulated enzymes  <cit> , and therefore it is reduced to water by ascorbate peroxidases  with the electrons derived from water splitting in psii  <cit> . glutathione reductase , an nadh-dependent enzyme, effectively maintains a reduced pool of glutathione  levels inside the chloroplasts to prevent oxidative damage by ros  <cit> . furthermore, in the ascorbate-glutathione pathway, apx and gr work synergistically to maintain ros levels below the threshold. catalases  convert h2o <dig> to water and molecular oxygen. these enzymes have extremely high maximum catalytic rates but low substrate affinities, and the reaction requires the simultaneous access of two h2o <dig> molecules in the active site  <cit> .

disequilibrium between ros production and antioxidant protection causes oxidative stress, and the accumulating ros causes peroxidation of lipids, denaturation of proteins, mutation in dna sequence and various other types of cellular oxidative damage . enhanced generation of ros has been found in plants under a variety of abiotic stresses, such as salt, drought, chilling, heat, and metal or metalloid stresses .

rice is one of the most widely consumed food crops, and is the most sensitive to drought stress during reproductive development , as rice spikelet fertility is extremely sensitive to water stress. in the absence of drought, yield potential determines grain production, but as drought becomes severe, drought escape or drought tolerance becomes important  <cit> . spikelet fertility is directly related to yield and is known to be sensitive to water and heat stress in rice . the upland rice variety, nagina  <dig>  is an internationally recognised hardy aus genotype frequently used in drought and heat tolerance studies  <cit> . it is reported to have comparatively less spikelet sterility under drought stress because of a more efficient antioxidant defence system for scavenging of h2o <dig> in panicles  <cit> .

rice, besides being a staple food crop, is also a model crop for genomics, particularly in monocots, owing to its relatively smaller genome size and the availability of high quality genome sequences  <cit>  and a wealth of genomic resources . numerous transcription factors and genes are implicated to be differentially expressed in rice under drought stress  <cit> , and some of these genes been demonstrated to increase drought tolerance . there have been multiple efforts to identify quantitative trait loci  related to yield under drought tolerance and their subsequent introgression in major rice varieties . although complex traits such as yield are routinely dissected into their component traits namely grain size, test weight, and number of productive tillers per plant in rice  <cit> , and functional markers have been developed  <cit>  for plant breeders, the same is not true in drought stress research.

drought resistance can occur through either through drought avoidance  or other drought tolerance mechanisms such as better water use efficiency and cellular tolerance. osmotic adjustment , oxidative stress management , and cell membrane stability  are the major components of cellular drought tolerance. so far, only limited literature is available in rice in the detection of qtls and their fine mapping and cloning of the causal genes associated with these physiological/biochemical traits related to drought tolerance. some researchers have identified qtls for cms  <cit> , osmotic adjustment , and water use efficiency  <cit>  and all of these were coarse or preliminary mapping studies. however, the components associated with drought tolerance  remain as associations for which neither the genetic basis nor the molecular basis has been unequivocally established. since the enzymes governing osm are well known, we decided to explore their role in spikelet sterility under drought stress in a mapping population of rice. this will validate any associations by using a genetical genomics approach.

in the present work, we have used a recombinant inbred population  derived from the genetic cross between the drought tolerant nagina  <dig> and the rice mega variety ir  <dig>  which is sensitive to drought stress at the reproductive stage. we have identified the extreme bulks for spikelet fertility under drought stress from this population and used them to investigate the mechanism of osm.

methods
plant material and growth conditions
rice genotypes, nagina  <dig> , ir  <dig>  and their  <dig> rils,  were phenotyped for drought tolerance at the experimental farm, indian agricultural research institute , new delhi  during the  <dig> and  <dig> kharif seasons. nagina  <dig> was chosen as the tolerant parent because of its international importance and positive attributes such as better drought and heat tolerance  <cit> . ir  <dig> which is sensitive to drought stress at reproductive stage, was chosen as the other parent because it is a mega variety and regularly used by rice breeders for its improvement through marker- assisted backcross breeding  <cit> . staggered nursery sowing at 5-days interval was done to synchronize the flowering time of rils as closely as possible. this was done based on the flowering data of rils recorded in the previous two generations . the experiment was done in an augmented block design with check lines repeated after every  <dig> rils. the check lines used were the rice cultivars nagina  <dig> and ir  <dig>  in both seasons. lines were planted in plots of 2 m ×  <dig>  m with a spacing of 20 cm × 20 cm between hills and rows, both in irrigated and water stress conditions. in  <dig>  a subset of rils  was planted in an augmented design under a rainout shelter at iari in 3 m ×  <dig>  m plot size with 15 cm × 20 cm spacing. standard cropping practices were adopted for proper nutrient and weed management. all plots were maintained at field capacity and water stress was imposed by withholding irrigation at the initiation of the booting stage to 10 days after anthesis in the majority of the lines. phenotyping for physiological traits was done after the rils showed leaf rolling and drying, whereas yield related parameters were measured at maturity.

on the basis of phenotype data recorded on spikelet sterility , and days to 50 % flowering  under drought stress in the  <dig> kharif,  <dig> rils were selected for validation of their ss phenotype. in  <dig>  these  <dig> rils were carefully phenotyped in the field for ss and yield related traits under stress. from these data, two extreme groups termed ‘tolerant bulk’  and ‘susceptible bulk’  were selected. a third group, termed ‘random bulk’  was created from the rest of the ril population using a random number method. each group comprised of eight rils and their flag leaves were collected and stored at −80 °c from both the irrigated and drought treatment plots. all the observations were individually measured in the lines constituting the bulks with adequate sampling  and averaged to obtain the trait means of the respective bulks.

observation of physiological and agronomic parameters
chlorophyll content of flag leaves was measured using the spad- <dig>  a portable chlorophyll meter, which measures the greenness or the relative chlorophyll concentration of leaves. plant height, panicle number, tiller number, number of spikelets per panicle , and single plant yield  were measured from five plants per ril. ss was calculated as ratio of unfilled spikelets to total spikelets from at least three main panicles and was expressed as percent . to assess yield reduction under stress compared to irrigated environments, the stress susceptibility index  was calculated using the formula, ssi = 1-/1-, where yi, yp, s, and yns represent individual yield, population mean yield, stress condition, and non-stress conditions, respectively  <cit> .

preparation of enzyme extracts
enzyme extracts for superoxide dismutase , glutathione reductase , ascorbate peroxidase  and catalase  was prepared from the flag leaf tissue samples that were pre-frozen in liquid nitrogen to prevent proteolytic activity, and ground in 3 ml extraction buffer containing  <dig>  m phosphate buffer  and  <dig>  mm edta. extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at  <dig>  g and the supernatant was used in the enzyme assay  <cit> . the bradford method was used to estimate protein concentrations of all the samples before performing enzyme assays. each enzyme assay was scaled down to a 200 μl volume and all the spectrophotometric measurements were done in a  <dig> well plate reader . enzyme assays were performed using three biological and three technical replicates. for each enzyme assay, at least eight readings at an interval of 30 s were collected and simple regression analysis was performed on optical density  vs. time to calculate the change in absorbance per minute. means of biological and technical replicates were collected to calculate final change in od per minute. sod activity in the samples was estimated by recording the decrease in the od of nitro-blue tetrazolium dye by the enzyme  <cit> . a volume of 200 μl reaction mixture contained 13 mm methionine, 25 mm nitroblue tetrazolium chloride ,  <dig>  mm edta, 50 mm phosphate buffer , 50 mm sodium carbonate and 10 μl enzyme extract. the reaction was started by adding 2 mm riboflavin and placing the tubes under two 15 w fluorescent lamps for 15 min. the reaction was stopped by switching off the light and keeping the tubes in the dark. a complete reaction mixture without enzyme, which gave the maximal colour, served as a positive control. a non-irradiated complete reaction mixture served as a blank. separate controls that lacked enzymes were used for total sod and inhibitor studies. the absorbance was recorded at 560 nm, and one unit of enzyme activity was taken as the amount of enzyme that reduced the absorbance reading to 50 % in comparison to control tubes. apx was assayed by recording the decrease in optical density because of ascorbic acid at 290 nm  <cit> . the 200 μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ,  <dig>  mm ascorbic acid,  <dig>  mm edta,  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> and 10 μl enzyme extract. the reaction was initiated with the addition of h2o <dig>  the molar extinction coefficient of  <dig>  mm− <dig> cm− <dig> was used for the calculation of enzyme activity. absorbance was measured at 290 nm in a uv-visible spectrophotometer. gr was assayed by recording the increase in absorbance in the presence of oxidized glutathione and dtnb   <cit> . the 200 μl reaction mixture contained 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer  containing 1 mm edta,  <dig>  mm dtnb  in  <dig>  m potassium phosphate buffer ,  <dig>  mm nadph, 10 μl enzyme extract and distilled water to make up the final volume. the reaction was initiated by adding  <dig>  mm gssg . the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was recorded and  <dig>  mm−1cm- <dig> was used as the molar extinction coefficient for calculation of enzyme activity. catalase was assayed by measuring the disappearance of h2o <dig>  <cit> . reaction mixture  consisted of 10 μl of dilute enzyme extract and 100 μl of  <dig>  m phosphate buffer  and 60 μl of water. the reaction was initiated by adding 30 μl of 75 mm h2o <dig>  a decrease in absorbance at 240 nm was observed every 30 s for over 3 min with uv- visible spectrophotometer.

sequence analysis of nagina  <dig> and ir  <dig> sod, apx, gr and cat genes
the sod, apx, gr, and cat gene cds and protein sequences from nagina  <dig> and ir  <dig> were retrieved from the manually curated database of rice proteins  <cit> . nagina  <dig> sequences were aligned to ir  <dig> sequences using clustalw and non-synonymous and synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified using bioedit v <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . i-mutant <dig>  <cit>  server was used to predict the effect of identified snps on protein stability. network analysis in ricenet v <dig>  <cit>  was performed using ‘gene prioritization based on network direct neighborhood’ option, and viewed using cytoscape v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  for sod, apx, gr and cat genes.

data analysis and visualization
majority of the data analysis was done in an open source r package  <cit>  for statistical computing. multivariate exploratory data analysis was done in factominer  <cit> , ggbiplot  <cit> , corrplot  <cit>  and, hmisc  <cit> . performanceanalytics  <cit>  was also used for data analysis and visualization. anova for the enzyme assay was performed using the op stat web server .

RESULTS
population performance under irrigated conditions and drought stress conditions at the reproductive stage
summary statistics for the agronomical and physiological attributes measured in parents, the entire ril population, extreme rils identified, and the three bulks namely, the tolerant, sensitive and random bulks under both the irrigated condition  and reproductive stage drought stress  condition during the two cropping seasons in  <dig> and  <dig> are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  significant differences were observed between the treatments across the traits, especially for plant height, number of spikelets/panicle, spikelet sterility and single plant yield in the parents and in the entire population. chlorophyll content  measured as spad value, was better in ir <dig> under both the treatment conditions compared to nagina  <dig>  tiller number  showed variation in the tolerant parent and the tolerant bulk between ic and rs. conversely, neither the sensitive parent nor the sb showed any difference in tn between ic and rs. there was an increase in the coefficient of variation  for plant height, panicle length and single plant yield  under rs compared to ic in both years. the mean of the  <dig> extreme rils identified was nearly identical to the population mean , across all of the traits; moreover, there was an increase in the variation, suggesting that the identification of the extreme lines was robust. although the extreme lines were identified based only on ss, the other traits also followed the same trend presumably because of the in-built trait correlations. this trend was more evident in single plant yield and ssi , perhaps because the trait correlations for these traits are more robust. interestingly, the random bulk identified, consisting of just eight lines, had a mean identical to the population of  <dig> lines across all the eight traits, except for number of spikelets/panicle. overall, the morphological observations collectively established the differential response of the parents and rils in the mapping population for drought stress, reflecting their diverse genetic background and the robust relationship between the target trait and the stress. the differential performance of bulks as well as the parents with respect to ss under the ic and rs suggested that they could be used as a background to study genetical genomics.table  <dig> descriptive statistics of agronomical and physiological parameters recorded in nagina 22/ir  <dig> ril population and bulks in 2011

enzyme assay
the enzyme assays for all four enzymes  were performed in the parents as well as in the constituent rils of all the three bulks. however, cat results were found to be error-prone despite repeating the experiment three independent times. hence, the results of only three enzyme assays are presented in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> enzyme assay results a tb, sb and nagina  <dig> had more sod activity under stress than control condition b decreased apx activity under stress was observed across all bulks and nagina  <dig> except ir  <dig> and c nagina  <dig>  ir  <dig> and tb showed more gr activity under stress as compared to control but not sb. tb: tolerant bulk, sb: susceptible bulk and rb: random bulk. vertical bars indicate ± se. asterisks  indicate significant difference  from control




sod activity
although, a general increase in sod activity was observed in all the bulks and in the parental genotype under drought stress , the activity was more pronounced in tb, sb and nagina  <dig> as compared to rb and ir  <dig> under stress situation. thus, though distinct differences in sod activity could be found between the parents, the same was not reflected in the extreme bulks.

apx activity
ascorbate peroxidase activity significantly decreased  across all the three bulks selected from the ril population as well as in the drought tolerant parent, nagina  <dig>  under rs compared to ic. the quantum of decrease in activity was the least in nagina  <dig> compared to sb and rb. however, in the other parent, ir  <dig>  apx activity significantly increased under rs compared to ic. this could be because either apx is not a key player in osm under drought stress or because ir  <dig> may have the better allele for one or more of the apx genes.

gr activity
although gr activity was found to be enhanced in tb and in both of the parents under rs , the quantum of increase was much higher in the tolerant parent followed by tb. the other extreme bulk, sb showed a decreased activity under stress, whereas in rb, the difference in activity under ic and rs was negligible. thus, gr was the only enzyme that had the expected activity in the contrasting parents and their extreme bulks.

the overall results of the enzyme assays though showed that different parents had better activity for different enzymes under stress, b﻿y comparing the quantum of ros activity, nagina  <dig> was superior to ir  <dig>  at least for gr and sod. the direction and quantum of expression in the extreme bulks established that there is a clear and robust correlation between the target trait ss and the gr activity in oxidative stress management under drought stress.

principal component analysis and linear correlations
since enzyme assay are the cumulative effect of multiple genes  that encode the enzymes in the genome, we undertook multivariate analysis. the multiple morphological and biochemical observations analysed for their possible correlated attributes by principal component analysis  and correlation analysis were expected to clarify these relationships because the observation of individual plants could be considered instead of the mean of the bulked rils. dimensionality of the data was revealed by an individual factor map  which showed that the parents, tb, sb and rb had differentiated into distinct groups under rs compared to ic. under rs, there was absolutely no overlap between the extreme bulks, whereas the random bulk was distributed across the extreme bulks thus, validating the suitability of the material under study. to capture the variability and interactions present in the morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits under different treatments, a variable factor map  and correlogram  were constructed. the first two principal components captured  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the variation under ic and  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % under rs, respectively. under ic, tn, spy, and the enzymes gr and sod were found to interact and were highly associated to pc- <dig> while spp and ss were associated with pc- <dig>  this is consistent with our observation that the performance of tb and nagina  <dig> was similar for tn, gr, and sod . under drought stress, the variability in apx, spp, tn and spad were primarily captured by pc- <dig>  whereas pc- <dig> explained the interactions for sod and ssi. this suggests that apx is also an important component under drought stress, although nagina  <dig>  tb, and sb did not show any difference between the treatments . thus, the multivariate analyses more clearly resolved the interactions between the enzyme assays and morphological traits under ic and rs.fig.  <dig> individual factor map biplots of the morpho-physiological and enzyme assay as obtained from  <dig> kharif data. a nagina  <dig> and ir  <dig> showed similar variation and were in the same quadrant. tb, sb and rb were also found to be overlapping under ic. b tb, sb and rb got differentiated into distinct groups under rs

linear trait correlations including the enzyme assay from the parents and the rils constituting the three bulks  and the entire population were analysed individually  under the two treatments. since only the extreme ril set, consisting of  <dig> individuals including the parents, had enzyme data, enzyme-morphological correlations were calculated usin﻿g this data set instead of the entire populatio﻿n under ic and rs. correlations among osm enzymes revealed that all three had significant and positive correlations under ic , while under rs, gr had a significant and positive correlation with apx . however, sod was negatively correlated with both apx and gr under rs. this could be the reason why the extreme bulks had the expected differences for gr and apx enzyme assay but not for sod . among the enzyme-morphological correlations, only the correlation between spy and gr was significant and positive under rs; and gr was significantly correlated with apx and sod, albeit in the opposite direction. apx and spad readings were positively correlated under rs while negatively so under ic. interestingly, under ic, none of the  <dig> pairs of correlations was significant between the osm enzymes and the morphological traits. this clearly shows that the osm pathway is significant only under drought stress and not under well-managed conditions. the target trait, ss also showed a robust correlation with the major productivity traits, spy and ssi . correlation analysis in ic and rs done in the population clearly defined the associations among the agronomic traits . for instance, under irrigated control conditions, ph was positively correlated to pl, ss, and spp, and inversely related to spy. similarly, tn and ss were positively correlated under ic. however the hierarchy and the direction of correlation completely changed under rs. a positive relationship was observed between spy, ph, ss and spad, negative correlation was observed between spy and ssi under rs .

snps and corresponding changes in proteins encoded by osm genes in the parents
there was a total of  <dig> osm genes in the rice genome, of which  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> code for sod, apx, gr, and cat, respectively. to investigate allelic differences in the multigenic ros enzymes  between the parents, sod, apx, gr, and cat gene sequences  for the parents were retrieved. both the cds and protein sequences of sod, apx, gr, and cat were compared. comparison of the cds revealed that one-third of the ros genes  had no snps. interestingly, most of the snps found resulted in non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in the proteins, especially in sod and gr genes, which accounted for eight out of nine changes. in case of apx encoding genes, 45 % of snps  resulted in synonymous substitutions. in apx <dig>  snp substitution resulted in a missense mutation; still the resulting amino acid substitution  did not alter the stability of the protein. in another apx gene , there was a long deletion  as well as a frame shift mutation caused by a single nucleotide insertion that resulted in a completely different protein in ir  <dig>  overall, these changes led to a more thermodynamically stable sod, apx, gr, and cat proteins in nagina  <dig> . in only one gene apx <dig>  the ir  <dig> allele had a more stable apx protein. the unfavorable allele from nagina  <dig> for apx <dig> was probably inherited by most of the plants that constituted the rb, sb, and tb. that is why apx activity in all the three bulks was similar to the nagina  <dig> parent . an interesting feature observed was the occurrence of two point mutations in the same codon at c. <dig>   <dig> positions in a sod coding gene  in ir <dig>  which is rare. this resulted in the acidic to basic amino acid substitution -p.d57q mutation that, in turn, resulted in a decrease in protein stability in the drought sensitive parent ir  <dig>  furthermore, the mitochondrial target of this gene makes it an important candidate in this spikelet sterility study. a snp found between the parents in grcp <dig> but none of the other gr genes, corresponded perfectly with their enzyme assay results . although we did not have the cat enzyme data, no snps were identified in catb whereas cata had three snps, all giving rise to the superior nagina  <dig> allele.table  <dig> snps identified between nagina  <dig> and ir  <dig> in the osm genes, sod, apx, gr and cat

network analysis of genes involved in osm in rice
our enzyme studies and multi-factor analyses suggested that all of the three enzymes are important players with respect to ss under drought stress, and all the snps between the parents in osm genes, except one, led to more stable proteins in the drought tolerant parent nagina 22; therefore we carried out a functional network analysis of the genes involved in osm in rice. an interaction analysis showed that while all of the sod, gr, and cat genes were present in the network, for apx only three out of the eight genes were present . apx <dig>  apx <dig>  and apx <dig> were found to interact with sodcp, catc, sod <dig>  and grcp <dig>  respectively. apx <dig> had more stability in ir  <dig> compared to the drought tolerant parent nagina  <dig>  whatever limited drought tolerance exhibited by ir  <dig> could be because of this apx <dig> gene. in nagina  <dig>  soda could bypass the less stable form apx <dig> and directly interact with four more sod genes, and the two gr genes present in the central network. thus the lesser stable form apx <dig>  does not negatively affect the drought tolerant parent in terms of its ultimate phenotype, ss or yield under rs. of the  <dig> genes present in the central network, nagina  <dig> had more stable proteins encoded by grcp <dig>  soda and sodcc <dig>  apx <dig>  and cata than ir 64; whereas, both parents shared the same allele for four more genes . for the two other genes present in the network , although we did not have the snp data, the network analysis revealed that the cat gene interacted with only apx <dig>  which had the functional allele in nagina  <dig> but not in ir  <dig> because of a frame-shift mutation. thus, the differences in the enzyme activity in the parents and extreme bulks under drought stress  could be explained by the snp changes and resultant protein stability in the parents, as suggested by the network analysis of the genes involved in the osm pathway, and the multivariate analyses.

discussion
breeding for drought tolerance in rice through introgression of qtls that govern yield under drought  <cit>  is still an open area of research, as the causal genes are not yet known. hence, one of the major challenges that researchers face is to unravel the complex mechanisms of drought tolerance through more intensive and integrated studies in order to find the key players or machineries that can be effectively exploited for developing drought tolerant crops  <cit> . oxidative stress management  is one such key machinery or component of cellular tolerance under drought stress in different crop plants  <cit> . since rice has abundant genomic resources, it is possible to design studies without the need to invest huge financial resources, just by effectively combining forward and reverse genetic approaches. in this study, we made use of a mapping population we developed for the identification of qtls of components for drought tolerance in rice, as well as utilized the genomic resources available in the public domain. one of the parents, nagina  <dig>  is tolerant to drought and known to have superior osm  <cit>  and higher spikelet fertility  <cit>  under drought.

we chose to use enzyme activity assays rather than real time transcript expression analysis for three reasons:  enzyme assays are more cost effective;  enzyme activity is a cumulative measure of activity of multiple genes; and  enzyme assays are closer to the phenotype than the transcript profiles to the phenotype, and our hypothesis for this work was that the biochemical or physiological component of phenotypes for complex traits should be identified along with morphological phenotypes through a genomic route that would allow for the identification of functional polymorphisms, and establish genotype-phenotype associations unequivocally in a mendelian population.

the demonstration of the effect of drought stress on yield component traits and osm enzyme activity under field conditions is not well documented in the available literature, especially in mapping populations. to our knowledge, this is the first report wherein enzyme activities have been measured under drought conditions imposed in the field and in well phenotyped extreme individuals following the principle of bulked segregant analysis in a synthetic mendelian population  <cit> . we decided to carry out the enzyme assays in extreme bulks for two reasons:  it would be difficult to do the enzyme assay in parents and all of the  <dig> rils from the mapping population because biochemical assays need to be completed in sufficient biological and technical replicate: and  our target trait is well defined. we added a third bulk, called a random bulk, to reflect the scenario in the rest of the population.

water stress caused significant reduction in ph, chlorophyll content, sf, and spy in the ril population including nagina  <dig>  ir  <dig>  and the bulks  compared to the irrigated control. although there was an overall decrease in productivity related traits in the population, nagina  <dig> and tb showed more tolerance than did ir  <dig> and sb under drought. a stress susceptibility index that is a measure of drought resistance  <cit>  showed nagina  <dig> and tb to be better performers under drought stress than ir  <dig> and sb. rb showed an intermediate tolerance to drought as expected.

water deficit causes a decline in photosynthetic rate and a limitation in carbon dioxide fixation, resulting in the exposure of chloroplasts to excess excitation energy and leading to the enhanced production of ros, especially o2− and h2o <dig>  <cit> . drought stress caused increased sod activity across all genotypes  compared to the irrigated control, indicating that high levels of h2o <dig> production and successful imposition of drought stress in field conditions. lower apx activities in all bulks and nagina  <dig> but not ir  <dig>  was observed under drought compared to the control, clearly showing an exhausted ascorbate pool because of drought stress. increased gr activity in nagina  <dig>  ir  <dig>  and tb  indicated an increased demand for reduced glutathione to combat the oxidative stress induced by drought. both apx and gr work together to maintain the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, and the differential regulation of apx and gr enzymes in nagina  <dig>  ir  <dig>  and their bulks under drought and control conditions is evidence that when one of the components of antioxidant defence is limiting it can be compensated for by the regulation of other components  <cit> , suggesting a common regulatory mechanism of osm genes  <cit>  in rice.

despite the compensatory mechanism of osm, the enzyme activity patterns matched well with snps found in the osm enzyme coding genes and their protein stability analyses . for sod and gr, the tolerant parent had higher activity under stress when compared to the sensitive parent. this is consistent with the observation that for two of the three gr enzymes, the parents had the same allele and for third one, the tolerant parent had the superior allele. thus, the parents were monogenic with respect to gr activity. this explains why the direction of enzyme activity was the same while the quantum was different between the parents. interestingly, the tb and sb behaved as though they have accumulated either all the favourable alleles or unfavourable alleles, respectively . this may account for the positive and significant gr-trait correlations . such behaviour of extreme bulks could not be explained by simply accounting for differences in gr, but are explained when considering other osm loci. in case of sod, for two of the seven genes, the parents had identical alleles, and for the rest of the sod genes, the tolerant parent had the superior allele. although, the parents behaved in accordance with this allelic composition, the extreme bulks were identical to each other  and this explains why the sod-trait associations were not significant . such a complex system is bound to arise when multiple genes govern a target trait. still, our network analysis along with the snp analysis clearly showed the cross-talk among sod, apx, gr, and cat enzymes and for most of the key players  that are central to this interaction, the tolerant parent had the favourable alleles. further expression analyses of all osm enzyme encoding genes during rs and ic with leaf and root samples might suggest other clues on the difference in drought stress response between nagina  <dig> and ir <dig>  however, improving osm is only one of the multiple factors that govern drought tolerance, especially sf under drought. recently, the oscpk <dig> gene in rice, which belongs to the group iii-b cdpk family, has been demonstrated to be involved in controlling sf under drought stress  <cit> . in rna interference studies, oshxk <dig> has also been implicated in spikelet fertility by its role in pollen germination and anther dehiscence  <cit> .

for most of the work on drought tolerance breeding in rice, a nagina  <dig> x ir  <dig> population is available, and now markers can be designed based on the snp information from our study, and used for marker-assisted selection of superior alleles of osm genes. an ideal drought tolerant cultivar shall possess all of the superior alleles known thus far from the literature and efforts must continue to identify the yet unknown partners.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study was carried out to unravel the oxidative stress management in rice under moisture deficit stress and associate the morphological, biochemical and genomic information to yield-related traits using a ril mapping population of nagina  <dig> and ir  <dig>  nagina  <dig> had superior alleles for sod  and gr  rather than for apx, for which ir  <dig> had the superior allele  in terms of predicted protein stability. gene network and snp analysis revealed the superiority of nagina  <dig> in terms of drought tolerance at reproductive stage.
