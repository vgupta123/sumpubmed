BACKGROUND
the p <dig> protein is an important tumor suppressor protein and is mutated in about 50 % of human cancers  <cit> . mice with a genetic disruption of the p <dig> gene develop tumors at a particularly young age  <cit> . one of the major functions of p <dig> is to control cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis under conditions where there is an increased risk of mutagenesis, for example after dna damage or nucleotide depletion  <cit> . for its anti-proliferative activity, p <dig> uses two distinct cellular pathways. as a transcription factor, p <dig> enhances the expression of pro-apoptotic target genes and represses transcription of anti-apoptotic target genes  <cit> . in addition, it associates with pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in the cytoplasm and controls their function  <cit> .

under normal growth conditions, p <dig> is rapidly degraded by the 26s proteasome machinery  <cit> . this process is mainly controlled by the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase mdm <dig> which mediates polyubiquitination of p <dig> and promotes the association of p <dig> with the proteasome  <cit> . other e <dig> ubiquitin ligases have been described to substitute for mdm <dig> under particular conditions . the mdm <dig> gene is itself a transcriptional target of p <dig>  thus forming a regulatory feed-back loop with p <dig>  other proteins like p14arf, the ribosomal protein l <dig>  the fk605-binding protein  <dig> or kap1/trim <dig> can impinge on this feedback loop and modulate mdm <dig> activity . under conditions of an increased risk of carcinogenesis, this feedback loop is interrupted and the normally short half-life of the p <dig> protein is considerably extended. this results in a strong accumulation of p <dig>  which, together with post-translational modifications that activate p <dig>  leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis .

since p <dig> induces cell death after its activation, significant research efforts are focused on harnessing this activity for tumor therapy, at least for those tumors with wild type p <dig>  this approach, however, requires a more detailed understanding of the regulation of p <dig> 

in order to increase our understanding of the regulation of p <dig> we searched for novel, evolutionary conserved regulators of p <dig> and mdm <dig> abundance by performing a mammalian cell-based overexpression screen using a cdna library obtained from the teleost medaka. in order to facilitate the initial screening process, pools of twenty-four cdna clones from the master library were prepared as transfection-ready plasmid dna mixtures. more than one hundred hits were identified in the first round of screening  using these cdna library pools. we sub-screened several of these hits and were able to successfully identify a number of proteins that were not previously known to regulate p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance. the human homologues of several of these genes were shown to regulate p <dig> and mdm <dig> abundance in the same way as the medaka genes, demonstrating that the identified genes are indeed regulators of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance.

RESULTS
in order to find novel regulators of p <dig> and mdm <dig>  we screened a cdna library from the teleost medaka. the library was prepared from stage eighteen , stage twenty-four  and stage thirty-two  medaka embryos  <cit> . it contains almost eighteen thousand full lengths genes of which almost fourteen thousand are annotated. in addition, about three thousand five hundred full length cdna clones with only partial sequence information are contained in the library. during library preparation, only the most complete representative of each gene was selected, resulting in a unigene cdna library. in order to simplify the screening procedure, which involved labor-intensive sds-page and western blot analysis of cellular lysates, pools of twenty-four clones were prepared as transfection ready plasmid dna samples. over seven hundred such cdna pools were arrayed in 96-well plates for the primary transfection-based screening experiments.

each pool of cdnas from the library was co-transfected into p53-negative h <dig> cells together with p <dig> and mdm <dig>  the absolute levels and ratios of overexpressed p <dig> and mdm <dig> were optimized to allow both increases and decreases in their abundance to be detected. to monitor mdm <dig> activity as well as mdm <dig> and p <dig> abundance in the absence of co-transfected cdnas from the library, control transfections using only p <dig> or p <dig> and mdm <dig> were performed. as an additional control to determine whether cdna library pools have a general impact on protein turnover we also transfected the wnt-receptor protein ror <dig> . twenty-four hours post-transfection total cell lysates were prepared and the amount of p <dig>  mdm <dig> and ror <dig> proteins was determined by sds-page and western blotting analysis . each library pool was analyzed at least twice and only pools that specifically altered the abundance of co-expressed p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> in at least two experiments were considered as candidates. using this primary screening approach, we identified one hundred and six pools that either increased or decreased abundance of p <dig> or mdm <dig> or both . the majority of the hits increased the abundance of either p <dig> alone or of p <dig> and mdm <dig>  while a lower number of library pools resulted in decreased p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance.fig.  <dig> screening of a medaka cdna library. a schematic drawing of the screening process.  <dig> clones of the cdna library were pooled and all pools were arrayed in 96-well plates. p53-negative h <dig> cells were transfected in  <dig> well-plates with p <dig> , mdm <dig> , one of the cdna library pools  and myc-ror <dig>  as control. to monitor mdm <dig> activity, and mdm <dig> and p <dig> abundance in the absence of co-transfected pools of the cdna library,  <dig> out of  <dig> wells were transfected with p <dig> and myc-ror <dig>  or with p <dig> and mdm <dig> and myc-ror <dig>  without library pools. for transfection, total amounts of plasmid dna in all samples were adjusted to 205 ng using vector dna. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and abundance of p <dig>  mdm <dig> and myc-ror <dig> were determined by western blotting. abundance of pcna was monitored for loading control. b h <dig> cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p <dig>  mdm <dig> and myc-ror <dig> together with the indicated pools of the cdna library, without the library  or without the library and without the plasmid encoding mdm <dig> , for control. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and abundance of p <dig>  mdm <dig>  myc-ror <dig> and pcna were determined by western blotting



in order to confirm that the complexity of the primary screening conditions would not prevent identification of p <dig> modulators, we spiked a non-modifying  pool from the library with plasmid dna encoding the known p <dig> modifiers p14arf and usp <dig> . p14arf stabilizes p <dig> by preventing the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p <dig> by mdm <dig>  <cit>  and the ubiquitin-specific protease usp <dig> deubiquitinates both mdm <dig> and p <dig>  resulting in their stabilization  <cit> . co-expression of p14arf and usp <dig> in amounts similar to those of the individual clones present in the screened pools  resulted in the expected stabilization of p <dig> and mdm <dig>  confirming the suitability of the primary screening conditions . indeed, one of the candidate pools identified in the primary screening contains the medaka usp <dig> gene homologue. the medaka p14arf homologue was however not present in the library.

in order to identify which genes in the candidate pools were responsible for regulating p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance, we performed a secondary screen using the twenty-four single cdna clones contained within each candidate pool. the individual cdna clones were amplified from the arrayed master library and, like the primary screen, were transfected together with p <dig>  mdm <dig> and ror <dig> . each cdna was analyzed at least twice and only those clones that altered p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance in at least two experiments were considered as candidates. from the one hundred and six pool hits that were identified in the first round of screening, the secondary screening procedure was performed on twenty. the majority  of these twenty pools harbored a single regulator of p <dig> or p <dig> and mdm <dig>  two pools harbored two regulators and, strikingly, one pool harbored three apparent regulators of p <dig> and mdm <dig> . thus, overall, 70 % of candidate pools identified and selected for secondary screening were found to contain regulators of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig>  six of the identified regulators affected only p <dig> and two of the cdnas affected only mdm <dig> abundance. four of the identified novel regulators increased mdm <dig> abundance and decreased p <dig> abundance and six increased both p <dig> and mdm <dig> abundance . among the seventeen cdnas that we found to regulate p <dig> or p <dig> and mdm <dig>  twelve were annotated and five had unknown sequences. the molecular function of the genes that we found in the sub-screen  ranged from a putative mapk-activating protein  to a lysosomal protein that is involved in the catabolism of heparin and keratan sulphate .fig.  <dig> subscreening of the medaka cdna library. a from the cdna pools that were considered to contain regulators of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig>  the individual bacteria were amplified from the master library. the plasmids were purified and  <dig>  ng of the individual cdnas were transfected together with p <dig> , mdm <dig>  and myc-ror <dig>  into h <dig> cells in a 96-well format. 24 h after transfection, cells were analyzed by western blotting. b h <dig> cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p <dig>  mdm <dig> and myc-ror <dig> together with the individual clones of the indicated pool hit or with plasmids encoding p <dig>  mdm <dig> and myc-ror <dig> without cdna clones, for control . 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed as described in the legend to fig. 1

we have performed a cell culture-based cross-species expression screen where a cdna library from medaka was used to screen for regulators of human p <dig> and mouse mdm <dig> in human cells. one aim of this screen was to identify evolutionarily conserved modifiers of the p <dig> signaling pathway. considering the evolutionary distance of teleosts and mammals we tested whether the human orthologues of the identified medaka genes would also be able to regulate p <dig> and mdm <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  the human orthologues of some of the genes identified  also regulated p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance . c1orf144/szrd <dig>  increased p <dig> abundance, trim <dig> increased p <dig> and mdm <dig> abundance, fam83f increased p <dig> abundance and decreased mdm <dig> abundance and rbm <dig> increased mdm <dig> abundance and decreased p <dig> abundance. we also tested the ability of c1orf144/szrd <dig> and fam83f to regulate endogenous p <dig> levels in p53-positive cells and in each case we could see the expected effect . furthermore, we recently demonstrated that trim <dig> also regulates endogenous p <dig>  <cit> . these results demonstrate that cell culture-based expression screening using a cdna library from medaka can identify evolutionarily conserved regulators of p <dig> and mdm <dig> fig.  <dig> human homologs of the cdnas that were identified by screening a medaka cdna library control p <dig> and mdm <dig> abundance. h <dig> cells were transfected with increasing amounts of plasmids encoding human myc-tagged c1orf <dig>  human v5-tagged trim <dig>  human flag-tagged fam83f and human flag-tagged rbm <dig> together with plasmids encoding p <dig> and mdm <dig>  for control, cells were transfected only with plasmids encoding p <dig> and mdm <dig>  24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed as described in the legend to fig. 1




discussion
we have performed a cross-species cell-based overexpression screen using a medaka cdna library to screen for novel regulators of p <dig> and mdm <dig> in human cells. sds-page and western blotting was used as a read–out to specifically detect the abundance of these proteins. since the cdna library contained more than seventeen-thousand genes, we used pools of twenty-four individual cdnas for transfection. strikingly, we found more than one hundred cdna pools that altered the abundance of co-transfected p <dig> and mdm <dig> in p53-negative h <dig> cells. the strategy of using pooled cdnas in the primary screen, where only six nanograms of each individual clone was co-expressed with p <dig> and mdm <dig>  likely resulted in missed hits , due to limits in sensitivity. about two hundred nanograms is the maximum amount of plasmid dna that can be transfected in 96-wells without significantly increasing cell toxicity and for this reason it was considered counter productive to further increase the amount of library clones in the primary screen. in the secondary screens, where double the amount of individual cdna clones were transfected compared to the primary screen, a more robust modification of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> protein levels were indeed seen. reducing the pool size to twelve rather than twenty-four would likely result in the identification of additional modifiers, however every screening experiment has its particular limitations and we believe that a good compromise was achieved using our strategy. another reason for missing potential regulators is that the activity of one regulator can be masked by an opposing activity of additional regulators present in the same pool. although this is unlikely to be a major factor, the surprising identification of three independent regulators in one of the pools confirms that this is an issue worth considering. in spite of these limitations, more than one hundred hits were identified using the library pools, several of which have indeed been verified.

twenty of the pools identified in the first round of screening were selected for a second round of screening in order to isolate the corresponding p53/mdm <dig> modifier. fourteen of the twenty pools indeed contained at least one cdna that regulated p <dig>  which represents a success rate of 70 %. one of the clones that we identified as a regulator of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig>  the splicing factor fubp <dig>  is already known to stabilize p <dig> in response to oxidative stress  <cit>  yet all other regulators of p <dig> identified in the sub-screen were not previously known to regulate p <dig> or mdm <dig>  due to the relatively well annotated nature of the cdna library it is possible to scan the library database for the identity of putative regulators within a candidate pool. one of the pools identified in the primary screen was found to harbor the known p <dig> and mdm <dig> regulatory gene, usp <dig>  <cit> . other known regulators of p <dig> or mdm <dig> like p14arf do not appear to be present in the library. nevertheless, as discussed above, it is not possible to find all regulators of p <dig> and many of the pools identified in the primary screening have yet to be analyzed by secondary screening. indeed, we only subscreened 20 % of the library. thus, it is possible that the remaining 80 % of the library will also contain some known regulators of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> that were not annotated. finally, this library was prepared from mrna extracted from developing embryos and early juvenile fish and it is unlikely that all regulators of p <dig> will be represented.

our previous success in searching for evolutionarily conserved interactors using cross-species screening methods  <cit>  prompted us to use a full length unigene library from the teleost medaka to screen for evolutionarily conserved regulators of mammalian p <dig> and mdm <dig>  several of the hits were validated after subsequent analysis of the corresponding human orthologues. importantly, all human homologs analyzed regulated p <dig> and mdm <dig> in the same way as the medaka library genes. thus, although medaka and humans are evolutionarily highly divergent, the principle mechanism used to regulate p <dig> levels appears to be highly conserved. the use of a medaka cdna library to screen for regulators of human genes is a promising approach in other areas of research. the main challenge will be to characterize the mode of action of the identified regulators.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that it is possible to identify regulators of p <dig> and mdm <dig> levels by performing a cross-species, cell-based cdna library expression screen. rapid screening of the entire library of over seventeen thousand genes was made possible by preparing pools of library cdnas that were used in the primary screening method. it is likely that such a screening method can also identify regulators of the abundance of other cellular proteins.
