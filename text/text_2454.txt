BACKGROUND
the primary function of the placenta is to regulate the transport of gases, nutrients and waste products between mother and fetus  <cit> . the placenta also serves as an endocrine organ, producing estrogens, progesterone and placental lactogens that are important for the maintenance of pregnancy  <cit> . while these functions have been conserved in all eutherian mammals, the relatively large variation in placental architecture  <cit>  makes the placenta an attractive model system for studying adaptive evolutionary changes  <cit> . placentae are classified on the basis of their gross shape and the distribution of contact points between the fetal tissues and the maternal endometrium  <cit> . the synepitheliochorial cotyledonary placenta of ruminants has three distinct tissue layers and is regarded as the most complex as compared to other placental types  <cit> . by contrast, in the discoid hemochorial placenta of primates and rodents, the fetal chorionic epithelium is directly bathed in maternal blood because the three maternal tissues layers are degraded. the molecular basis for these anatomical changes and their adaptive significance remain largely unknown.

recent studies demonstrating that phenotypic changes with adaptive significance can be caused by the action of individual genes provide an important rationale for the identification of genes that may be highly divergent or unique to a specific lineage or clade . furthermore, there is a relative abundance of novel or lineage-specific transcripts   <cit>  and lineage-specific regulatory non-coding rnas   <cit>  in the transcriptomes of different eukaryotes. however, little is known about the role of divergent genes and lineage-specific transcripts in adaptive evolution. in ruminants, there is unequivocal evidence for lineage-specific and highly divergent genes expressed in the placenta and/or trophoblast e.g., genes encoding interferon-tau  <cit> , the placental lactogens  <cit> , the pregnancy associated glycoproteins  <cit>  and the prolactin related proteins  <cit> . all of these highly divergent proteins appear to play adaptive roles in the reproductive biology of ruminants.

given the unique adaptations of the reproductive system of ruminants, our goal is to use comparative genomics to identify genes and ncrnas that are responsible for these evolutionary changes. toward that end, we recently developed a bioinformatics strategy to mine collections of expressed sequence tags  for divergent homologs and novel transcripts  <cit> . this strategy led to the discovery of the ulbp gene cluster and eight divergent homologs in cattle  <cit> . herein, we describe the application and extension of our approach for identifying and characterizing nts expressed in mammalian tissues. using this approach,  <dig> nts were identified in a collection of cattle placenta ests and then verified by in silico extension with dna sequences in the public domain databases, gene expression profiling, and alignment to whole genome sequence.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of novel transcripts in cattle placenta
a collection of  <dig>  5' ests from a cattle term placenta cdna library was reduced to a working set of  <dig> putative nts and divergent homologs using pairwise blastn  <cit>  searches against non-cetartiodactyl est and genome databases , followed by in silico extension and full-clone sequencing of cdna inserts . analysis of the sequence-extended est-containing clones using tblastx searches against human and mouse unigene  <cit> , and against ests from non-cetartiodactyl species, permitted the distinction of divergent  from unknown  transcripts . repetition of in silico extension of est sequences followed by removal of homologs using subsequently updated databases  removed an additional  <dig> ests, thus leaving  <dig> putative nts. using the  <dig> × btau_ <dig>  cattle genome assembly  <cit>  as a reference,  <dig> transcripts were found likely to represent priming from poly a tracts of genomic dna. these artifacts were subsequently removed, bringing the final working set to  <dig> nts that have an average length of  <dig> bp . the definition of a transcript as novel thus indicates that the nucleotide sequence or hypothetical proteins encoded by it does not have similarity to any non-cetartiodactyl dna or protein sequence at the time the databases were searched. the operational term is not meant to imply an evolutionary mechanism, such as gene loss or rapid divergence.

alignment to the cattle genome sequence assembly allowed polya signals to be identified within  <dig> bp downstream from the end of the aligned nt. polyadenylation signals were found in 86/ <dig>  of the nts . the consensus signal, aataaa, was present in  <dig>  of the nts;  <dig>  had the less conserved signal attaaa, and  <dig>  had rare polyadenylation signals experimentally identified in human mrna  <cit> . a polyadenylation signal was not detected in  <dig>  of the nts, likely representing incomplete transcripts.

analysis of the  <dig> nts revealed  <dig> nts with one or more open reading frames  > <dig> codons . among these  <dig> nts there are  <dig> predicted orfs > <dig> codons, all of which were considered as candidates for encoding novel proteins . the cdna clone with the longest orf, btc1_14rd, contains  <dig> codons. tblastn of the translated orfs against all predicted cattle transcripts resulted in  <dig> unique hits, of which seven are to hypothetical proteins,  <dig> are to predicted proteins , and two have similarity to known cattle proteins . while all orfs > <dig> codons terminate in a stop codon,  <dig>  do not possess an atg start codon, suggesting that at least some of the nts represent 3' regions of genes or have orfs with alternate start codons. the orfs possessing an atg start codon were analyzed for the presence of the kozak consensus sequence rmc-atg-g, a signal for eukaryotic translation initiation  <cit> , where r is a purine and m is . one orf matched this consensus pattern and  <dig> orfs matched the less restricted kozak pattern r-n-n-atg-r, where n is any nucleotide, and r is a purine.

protein motifs are predicted in the translated orfs of four nts . in addition, a transmembrane helix  was identified in one orf  predicted to contain a single-span tmh. signal peptides are predicted in four orfs with no concomitant tmh prediction  thus indicating that these transcripts encode soluble/secreted proteins. functional elements located in untranslated regions  are predicted in  <dig> nts . the nt btc1_43pw contains a predicted selenocysteine insertion sequence  element. these elements are required for translation of the uga codon as selenocysteine in mrnas of selenoproteins, several of which are species-specific and participate in peroxide degradation and antioxidant reactions  <cit> . the utr sequence region corresponding to the secis prediction was manually verified for the appropriate secondary structure . two sequences, btc1_40pw and btc1_14rd, are predicted to contain conserved ncrna secondary structural elements within their 3' utrs thus implicating them in regulatory functions.

the gc-content average of the nts, mrnas and genomic dna sequence is  <dig>  ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively . ten percent of nts have low gc content average  as compared to 12% of full length mrnas and 31% of genomic scaffold sequence that contains the nts. candidate exonic cpg islands were identified in 5' ends of four nts . criteria for cpg islands were length > <dig> bp, gc content ≥ 53% and observed/expected cpg ratio ≥  <dig>   <cit> . anchoring the nts to the  <dig> × draft cattle genome sequence allowed the identification of  <dig> additional nts with cpg islands upstream of their start sites. other nts with regulatory sequence features included  <dig> with inverted repeats of at least  <dig> bp. the longest inverted repeats are  <dig> bp and separated by approximately  <dig> bp. in addition,  <dig> nts contain g-quartets, which are tetrads of guanine/purine tetramers that are implicated in transcription pausing, mrna stability, recombination hotspots, stability of chromosomes and interactions of telomeres .

twenty-one nts qualified as candidate ncrnas . these nts have no orf > <dig> codons, and no predicted exon within  <dig> kb of flanking cattle genome sequence. among these,  <dig> contain a known polyadenylation signal, of which seven are spliced, and  <dig> align to the genome sequence along the transcript's entire length with >95% identity .

genomic context of the nts
the genomic organization of the nt genes was determined by blastn against the  <dig> × cattle genome draft sequence. all  <dig> nts have matches in the cattle genome ,  <dig> of which have ≥98% identity over >95% of their length and  <dig> have polyadenylation signals . the remaining  <dig> nts have well-defined intron-exon boundaries indicative of mrna splicing , of which  <dig> possess a polyadenylation signal . cpg islands were located upstream of  <dig> of these  <dig> transcripts. of the  <dig> nts,  <dig> were mapped in silico to chromosome locations in the cattle genome on the basis of existing radiation hybrid  and comparative mapping information  <cit>  . the remaining  <dig> were located on unmapped scaffolds. among the  <dig> mapped nts,  <dig> were located on bta <dig> . this analysis also revealed that  <dig>  of the nts are located within "intergenic" regions and  <dig>  of the nts are within introns of known genes . three of the nts on bta <dig>  were located within introns of the developmentally regulated genes hoxb <dig>  jaf <dig> and atp1a2a. in addition,  <dig> nts  are located either in subtelomeric regions or at the boundaries of homologous synteny blocks as defined by everts van der wind et al.  <cit>  . the distribution of nts was positively associated  with the subtelomeric regions  as compared to the distribution of randomly chosen refseq genes.

among the  <dig> nts,  <dig> have no ncbi  <cit>  annotation. the  <dig> annotated nts that aligned to the cattle genome were analyzed in greater detail. each of them was found to have a gene model and a cattle refseq identification number . most appear to be either alternatively spliced variants, antisense to the predicted genes, or long and divergent 3' ends of predicted genes. the  <dig> annotated nts were examined further by comparing full-length mrna sequence from the cattle refseq prediction to the human genome. similarity between the full-length cattle refseq predictions and human genes was found only for  <dig> of the nt-containing refseq genes . among these  <dig> cattle refseq genes with putative human orthologs, the nts contained within them represent novel splice products, whereas three are novel antisense products. in silico comparative mapping confirmed homologous positions within the cattle and human genomes, thus providing additional supporting evidence that these  <dig> nts are part of highly divergent genes and/or genes created de novo .

it was also possible to predict locations where genes encoding the nts should be in the human genome . this was accomplished by identifying the cattle genome sequence flanking the nts with significant nucleotide similarity in the human genome . anchoring the nts to the human genome using conserved flanking sequences revealed that 69% have an assumptive location in intergenic regions or within an intron of a known human gene. the genomic context for all  <dig> nts is given in additional file  <dig>  a detailed description of the genomic context of three nts is presented below. the number that can be presented is limited by available space .

btc1_14rd and btc1_130fl: alternatively spliced mrnas of a novel, paralogous gene residing amongst known transcription factors
btc1_14rd  and btc1_130fl have 93% and 92% nucleotide identity, respectively, to artiodactyla-specific transcript  <dig>  identified by kim and coworkers  <cit> . neither gene has an ortholog in the human or mouse genome. the three transcripts, ast <dig>  btc1_14rd and btc1_130fl, were aligned to bac ac <dig> . both btc1_14rd and btc1_130fl mapped at position bta18:55591560– <dig>   <dig>  kb from ast <dig> . genscan  <cit>  also predicts a cattle gene in this region, which is supported by alignment of numerous cattle ests and a cpg island flanking the transcription start site . from the alignments it is apparent that btc1_130fl is an alternatively spliced form of btc1_14rd and that both transcripts represent a gene that is paralogous  to ast <dig> . the assumptive human genome context of btc_14rd and btc1_130fl was then investigated by anchoring to the human genome, conserved sequences flanking the nts in the cattle bac ac <dig> . nucleotide similarity was used to anchor btc1_14rd, btc1_130fl and ast <dig> mrnas to hsa19q, between the human genes znf <dig> and zim <dig> . this region of the human genome is rich in retrotransposed sequences, imprinted genes  and genes encoding zinc-finger proteins thus indicating a high level of evolutionary and biological activity.

btc1_146je: a putative non coding rna
btc1_146je is a  <dig> bp transcript that contains an inverse repeat, and is found only in cattle and bottleneck dolphin . there is no orf and no blast hit to any non-cetartiodactyl exon within  <dig> kb of flanking genomic sequence 5' and 3' of the nt gene on bta <dig> . a large number of unannotated, spliced cattle ests align to contig <dig> in the same position further supporting its characterization as a novel spliced transcript.

the genomic dna sequence flanking btc1_146je in contig <dig> permitted comparative anchoring to hsa14q <dig>  in an intergenic, non-conserved region containing a cluster of small nucleolar rnas . these snornas are encoded in the introns of the non-coding maternally expressed gene meg <dig>  <cit> . meg <dig> is currently not included in the ucsc  <cit>  database of known genes and thus not shown in figure  <dig>  to test the possibility that btc1_146je represents the pre-processed rna for a snorna, a blastn search was carried out using the cluster of snornas as query sequences . the  <dig> bp snornas 14q and 14q  <cit>  aligned with btc1_146je with short matches . this suggests that btc1_146je represents a precursor rna from which a cetartiodactyl-specific snorna  is processed.

btc1_113fl: a novel transcript expressed preferentially in the thalamus
btc1_113fl  is a  <dig> bp transcript found only in cattle. it encodes a hypothetical protein  <dig> aa in length and whose gene is located on bta <dig> . alignment of btc1_113fl to cattle contig <dig> reveals a gene with five exons . the gene is located within  <dig>  kbp of the 3' end of and in opposite orientation to secp <dig>  the presence of a gene in this location is strongly supported by a large number of spliced ests containing at least one gt/ag splice site, a genscan prediction of  <dig> exons, a cpg island that spans the first exon and the probable transcription start site , and detection of expression in multiple tissues. dna sequence flanking the gene corresponding to btc1_113fl on contig <dig> anchors it to hsa1p <dig> , consistent with the available comparative mapping data  <cit> . visual inspection indicates that btc1_113fl should fall in a region of the human genome occupied by mgc <dig> , a rab gtpase oncogene involved in vesicle-trafficking; however, blastn, tblastx and tblastn searches of btc1_113fl against mgc <dig> sequence resulted in no significant matches, demonstrating a lack of detectable homology between the exons of the two transcripts. blat  <cit>  alignment of this nt against the human genome also reveals no alignment anywhere within the chromosome cytogenetic band where the nt is anchored by its flanking sequence. these data provide evidence that btc1_113fl is a lineage-specific novel transcript.

expression and tissue distribution of nts
expression levels of the nts were analyzed in  <dig> tissues from a one week-old jersey calf and a term placentome. expression of 86/ <dig> nts could be analyzed . the expressed nts were categorized with respect to the presence or absence of orf as well as with expression levels classified as high, moderate or low on the basis of an arbitrary scale . among the  <dig> expressed nts with orfs, 55% were expressed at a low level in all  <dig> tissues, and 45% were expressed at moderate or high levels in one or more tissues . a similar distribution of expression levels in tissues was found among the nts without orfs. tissue-preference in expression patterns of nts was analyzed further by determining those nts that were expressed greater than two-fold in any one tissue compared to at least  <dig> out of  <dig> other tissues . a total of  <dig> nts show tissue preference in their expression pattern. of these,  <dig> were preferentially expressed in a single tissue. six nts were preferentially expressed in placentome, of which two were predicted to be ncrnas. ten different tissues showed exclusive expression of one or more of the nts, with placentome and thymus having the largest number.

discussion
comparative genomics, bioinformatics and microarray analysis were used to identify  <dig> transcripts encoded in the cattle genome, but not encoded in the genomes of non-ferungulate mammals . the yield of nts from the original est collection is 91/ <dig>  =  <dig> %, suggesting that nts are relatively rare. among the  <dig> nts,  <dig> orfs were identified, of which  <dig> are < <dig> codons and  <dig> are > <dig> codons . the latter have a high probability of coding for a protein  <cit> . using interproscan  <cit> , the lack of pfam hmm matches for 99% of nt orfs is strong evidence for absence of homology to known proteins. anchoring the nts to the cattle genome allowed identification of  <dig> transcripts having cpg islands upstream of their start sites , providing additional support for their classification as protein-coding genes or ncrnas. specific protein functional motifs were identified in  <dig> predicted proteins encoded by the nts, and  <dig> have functional non-coding motifs . all but five of the nts showed evidence of active transcription in one or more tissues, and six were found to be preferentially expressed in cattle placentome, which is the source tissue of the est collection used to mine for nts. these results collectively provide the first conclusive evidence for an abundance of lineage- and tissue-specific transcripts encoded in the cattle genome.

the  <dig> nts identified as high-probability ncrnas provide a useful set of probes for exploring gene regulation in placental development and function  <cit> . five of the putative ncrnas are preferentially expressed in tissues that comprise the brain-immune-endocrine axis; placentome, thymus, thalamus, cerebrum or cerebellum. seven contain inverted repeats that may be involved in internal base-pairing and gene regulation  <cit> . these putative ncrnas may thus represent spliced, single-exon, primary snorna or microrna transcripts  <cit> . although micrornas , snornas and other ncrnas that are not polyadenylated, may have been filtered out using our methods, on the basis of our findings, it is clear that placenta is a rich source of ncrnas. further studies are needed to clarify their functions in placental physiology.

the availability of a draft of the cattle genome sequence provided an opportunity to study the comparative genomic organization of the nts, to confirm their authenticity, and to distill evidence for their origin, evolution and function. for the examples presented, as well as others in the dataset, the genes encoding the nts are flanked by genes that are conserved in the human genome. this allowed us to identify a presumptive human genome context for the nts. the recent availability of a  <dig> × draft of the dog genome sequence allowed us to ask ex post facto whether the nts are present in the dog genome. it was interesting to find that only five of the nts  matched sequences in the dog genome, suggesting that the sequences encoding these nts were present in a ferungulate ancestor. the most parsimonious explanation for the presence of nts in the cattle genome but not in other non-ferungulate mammalian genomes is that the nt genes were deleted from a common ancestor of primates and rodents after its divergence from the ferungulates . thus, in total,  <dig> nts were identified that are  only found in cattle, and  <dig> were identified in cattle and other cetartiodactyla . among the ruminants, this could represent the de novo formation of genes by overprinting  <cit> , more recent gene deletion, extreme divergence, or the lack of complete genome sequence information for the other species. other proposed mechanisms for the appearance of lineage-specific genes, such as retrotransposition , are not excluded by our analysis. further study of the phylogenetic distribution of the nt genes will provide a better understanding of their origin, and the timing of gene loss/gain in ancestral species.

the cetartiodactyl nts btc1_14rd and btc1_130fl represent interesting examples of transcripts that are encoded within a highly dynamic genomic context . btc1_14rd/btc1_130fl and ast <dig>  are located in a region of the cattle genome that is surrounded by genes encoding zinc-finger proteins. ast <dig> and its neighboring genes, peg <dig> and zim <dig>  were previously shown to undergo lineage-specific imprinting, and peg <dig> and zim <dig> are thought to have undergone rearrangements independently in different lineages  <cit> . roughly  <dig> kbp of the cattle genome between peg <dig> and zim <dig>  spanning btc1_14rd and ast <dig> is absent in the human genome, and there are a large number of segmental duplications in this region. the entire locus maps ~ <dig> mbp from the telomere of bta <dig>  it is known that telomeric and subtelomeric regions are highly active in segmental duplications and the formation of novel genes  <cit> . thus, the artiodactyl-specific genes for ast <dig> and btc1_14rd appear to have been created by a segmental duplication. analysis of other ferungulate genomes will shed greater light on the origin and evolution of these interesting genes. given their genomic context and imprinting status these genes may play an adaptive role in placental function.

the significant number of novel transcripts expressed preferentially in cattle placenta and in other tissues raises the question of their role in adaptive evolution. are the genes encoding these transcripts lost in other genomes because they are dispensable or do they have adaptive evolutionary significance? is gene gain by insertion, segmental duplication and/or chromosome duplication a driving mechanism of adaptive evolution? evolutionary theory has long held that adaptive phenotypic change is realized through changes in developmental processes  <cit> . the genes that control these developmental processes are known to be highly conserved  <cit>  and it is believed that adaptive evolutionary change is fueled by mutations that modify the expression of these conserved regulatory loci  <cit> . we and others have proposed that rapidly evolving genes, "novel" or lineage-specific genes, and ncrnas play a role in mediating changes in gene expression that affect regulatory genes controlling fundamental developmental processes  <cit> . lineage-specific genes can appear as a result of non-homologous recombination of exons between different genes  <cit> , or from fast-evolving duplicated genes that have lost significant sequence similarity even within relatively short evolutionary time-spans  <cit> . keese and gibbs  <cit>  provided numerous examples of genes that are created de novo by translation of previously unused reading frames of existing coding and non-coding genomic dna, a mechanism that has been called "overprinting"  <cit> . each of the nts has its own evolutionary history, and understanding their origins will require sequence information from additional mammalian genomes. whether they are rapidly evolving and dispensable  <cit>  and/or have adaptive functions can only be determined by experimentation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> lineage-specific transcripts discovered in the present study are a new resource for studies of adaptive changes in placental architecture and function. the tissue distribution of the nts suggests that many of them also have adaptive roles in other tissues. the presence of so many lineage-specific genes in cattle and their association with subtelomeric regions, which are hotspots for chromosome rearrangements and recombination, suggests that gene loss and gain are important mechanisms of genome evolution in mammals. the sequencing of additional vertebrate genomes with defined phylogenetic relationships will enable the search for lineage-specific genes to take on a more evolutionary perspective that is required to understand their origins and functions.
