BACKGROUND
the complete genome sequence of the free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans and the wealth of information on gene expression and function for this nematode  <cit>  provide an excellent starting point for genome analysis of other nematodes. for less well studied organisms, where whole genome sequencing is currently unlikely, expressed sequence tag  analysis is a cost-effective method for gene discovery. est analysis has been widely used within the phylum nematoda. however, most effort has been focused on plant or animal parasitic nematodes. free living nematodes, with the notable exceptions of c. elegans, c. briggsae and pristionchus pacificus, remain under represented in terms of ests.

aphelenchus avenae is a well-known fungal feeding nematode that is currently placed in the superfamily aphelenchoidea   <cit> . this nematode is ubiquitous in soil and is associated with saprophytic, pathogenic, and mycorrhizal fungi. as a fungal feeder, a. avenae has potential as a bio-control agent against soil-borne fungal plant pathogens  <cit>  and, as it has a remarkable ability to survive desiccation; it is also used as a model system for studying anhydrobiosis in animals  <cit> .

although a. avenae is commonly found in soil samples taken from the rhizospheres of diseased and healthy plants, it is widely considered to be incapable of attacking healthy tissues of higher plants  <cit> . it has been suggested that when the nematode is found in association with plant material this occurs as a result of the nematode feeding on fungi associated with the plant. alternatively, the finding of a. avenae within plant tissues  <cit>  and its demonstrated ability to reproduce on plant callus material  <cit>  may show that it can survive in healthy plant tissues and act as a facultative plant parasite. the role, if any, of a. avenae in relation to plant disease therefore remains uncertain.

in a previous study  <cit> , we described the generation, analysis and annotation of over  <dig>  ests from the pinewood nematode, bursaphelenchus xylophilus, a pathogenic nematode species which was thought to belong to the same superfamily  as a. avenae  <cit>   and which can feed on live trees as well as on fungi. genes encoding a range of cell-wall-degrading enzymes including cellulase   <cit> , β- <dig> -endoglucanase <cit> , pectate lyase  <cit>  and expansin  <cit>  were subsequently identified and characterized from this nematode. similar enzymes  <cit>  have also been identified and characterized from other plant parasitic nematodes including cyst and root-knot nematodes. these enzymes are produced within the esophageal gland cells of the nematode, secreted through the nematode stylet into host tissues and are thought to play an important role in the host-parasite interaction, allowing invasion and migration of the nematode through plant tissues. the presence of these enzymes is unusual; they are not usually present in animals and it is thought that the genes encoding them may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> .

in classical taxonomic classification, a. avenae  has been placed in the same superfamily  as b. xylophilus  whereas cyst and root-knot nematodes are placed in a different superfamily, the tylenchoida , although the three nematode groups are all placed within the infraorder tylenchromorpha  <cit> . however, recent phylogenetic studies using ribosomal dna suggest that a. avenae is more closely related to cyst and root-knot nematodes than it is to b. xylophilus  <cit> . the current view of the taxonomy of three nematode groups is summarized in fig.  <dig> 

although some of the parasitism genes are common to both superfamiles, aphelenchoidea  and tylenchoidea , there are also differences between the parasitism genes present in the two nematode groups  <cit> . for example, bursaphelenchus and cyst/root-knot nematodes contain endogenous expansins and pectate lyases which appear to have been acquired by a common ancestor via horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . however, the cellulases in the two groups are different. those present in cyst and root-knot nematodes are from glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> and are likely to have been acquired from bacteria whereas those in bursaphelenchus are from ghf <dig> and appear to have been acquired from fungi  <cit> . nothing is currently known about such pathogenicity genes in a. avenae and the presence or absence of such genes in this nematode may shed light onto whether this nematode can act as a plant parasite. in addition, the presence of such horizontally acquired genes in a. avenae may also help reveal the evolutionary history of these genes within nematodes.

to address these issues, we have generated over  <dig>  high quality ests from a mixed-stage a. avenae cdna library. we report the identification of genes that could encode enzymes that degrade the cell walls of plants or fungi. we have also analysed the clustered a. avenae sequences using the gene ontology  classification system and undertaken comparative analysis with c. elegans and other nematode protein databases.

RESULTS
generation of ests from an a. avenae cdna library
a mixed-stage a. avenae cdna library  was constructed to generate ests . sixteen clones were randomly selected and the sizes of the inserts in these clones were assessed after digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes. these insert sizes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  base pairs  with an average of  <dig>  kilobase pairs . a total of  <dig>  cdna clones were subsequently randomly isolated and sequenced from the 5' end in order to generate ests. the sequences were trimmed of vector sequence, adaptor sequence, poly tail and low-quality sequence and filtered for minimum length , resulting in a total of  <dig>  high quality ests. the average length of submitted ests was  <dig> nucleotides .

cluster formation and analysis
to identify overlapping est sequences, improve base accuracy and transcript length, and to produce non-redundant est data for further functional annotation and comparative analysis, the  <dig>  ests from the a. avenae library were grouped by sequence identity into clusters. based upon regions of nucleotide identity, est sequences were merged into contiguous consensus sequences . 'contig' member ests derive from identical transcripts while 'cluster' members may derive from the same gene but represent different transcript splice isoforms . two thousand seven hundred non-redundant est clusters were generated from the ests . in  <dig>  cases, clusters consist of a single est, whereas the largest single cluster contains  <dig> ests  . the majority of contigs  were composed of 2- <dig> ests.  <dig> clusters were found to contain multiple contig members, revealing potential splice isoforms. by eliminating redundancy during this contig building, the total number of nucleotides used for further analysis was reduced from  <dig>  million to  <dig>  million. in addition, this process significantly increased the length of assembled transcript sequences from  <dig> ±  <dig> nt for submitted ests alone to  <dig> ±  <dig> nt for contigs. the longest sequence generated also increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt.

based on the identified clusters  <dig>  a. avenae genes were identified, corresponding to a new gene discovery rate of 53% . however,  <dig> clusters is likely to be an overestimate of the true gene discovery rate, as one gene could be represented by multiple nonoverlapping clusters. such "fragmentation" has been estimated at 18% using c. elegans as a reference genome  <cit> . after allowing for such potential fragmentation, we estimated that the a. avenae sequences derived from minimum of  <dig>  genes giving a discovery rate of 44% . assuming between  <dig>  and  <dig>  total genes, the range encompassed by meloidogyne hapla  <cit> , m. incognita  <cit>  and c. elegans , the cluster dataset could represent approximately 11-16% of a. avenae genes.

transcript abundance and highly represented genes
a high level of representation in a cdna library usually correlates with high transcript abundance in the original biological sample  <cit> , although artifacts of library construction can result in a selection for or against some transcripts. the a. avenae clusters were ranked according to the number of contributing ests, and the top  <dig> clusters are summarized in table  <dig>  each of these clusters contained fifteen or more est copies and represented 16% of the total number of ests obtained. eighteen of the clusters had significant matches to genes with annotated functions based on blastx  against the non-redundant database, and all of these had homologues in nematodes. transcripts abundantly represented in the a. avenae library included genes encoding structural proteins  and proteins which carry out core metabolic processes . other abundant ests included a small heat shock protein and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. the latter enzyme has previously been cloned from the parasitic nematodes, haemonchus contortus and ascaris suum  <cit> . cluster aac <dig>  containing  <dig> ests, was similar to an sxp/ral- <dig> family protein from the parasitic nematode, anisakis simplex. similar genes have previously been characterized from plant parasitic nematodes  <cit> , and individual genes have been shown to be expressed in a range of secretory tissues including the gland cells surrounding the main sense organs  and the hypodermis.

a c. elegans homolog has higher probability match than the best genbank descriptor

seven of the  <dig> most abundantly represented transcripts from a. avenae had no significant similarity to any sequence in the non-redundant protein database . since most nematode data are available only as ests and therefore not included in the blastx analysis, we compared these  <dig> contigs against dbest using blastn and tblastx. however, these searches returned no significant matches . we also conducted blastn and tblastx searches against the non-redundant nucleotide database for these sequences. six of the clusters did not return any matches from this database but cluster aac <dig> produced a match using tblastx analysis  .

comparisons to proteins from other species
we compared the  <dig>  cluster sequences from a. avenae against three databases containing protein sequences from different organisms. the cluster sequences were compared with protein sequences from  c. elegans ,  other nematodes , and  organisms other than nematodes   <cit> . 66% of the a. avenae clusters  had matches in one or more of the three databases and these matches were represented using simitri  <cit>  . in the majority of cases where homologies were found , matches were found in all three databases surveyed. gene products in this category are generally widely conserved across metazoans and many are involved in core biological processes. examination of the individual database searches showed that  <dig>   had homologues in c. elegans,  <dig>   in other nematodes and  <dig>   in organisms other than nematodes. the  <dig> clusters  which had no significant similarity to any sequences in these three protein databases were searched against non-redundant nucleotide and dbest databases using blastn and tblastx .  <dig> clusters generated matches in these searches but no matches were obtained for the remaining  <dig> sequences .

the  <dig> cluster sequences where homologs were present only in other nematodes were further categorized based on their blast  results . matches were found in plant parasitic, animal parasitic and free living nematodes.  <dig> % of sequences  had homology only to sequences from plant parasitic nematodes. some of these sequences were similar to previously characterized cell-wall-degrading enzymes, which are known to be involved in the parasitism process of these nematodes. for example, cluster, aac <dig> matched an expansin-like protein from b. xylophilus  <cit>  and cluster, aac <dig> matched a β- <dig> -endoglucanase precursor from globodera rostochiensis  <cit> . further analysis of some of the cell-wall-degrading enzymes present in a. avenae is presented below.

identification of transcripts similar to stress-response genes related to desiccation
blastx  searches of a. avenae cluster sequences against nr protein databases allowed identification of genes that can encode proteins or enzymes important in providing protection against desiccation or other environmental-stress . one notable observation was the presence of sequences similar to late embryonic abundant  proteins, which are known to be associated with tolerance to water stress resulting from desiccation  <cit> . protein aggregation during desiccation is likely to be a major potential hazard for anhydrobiotes; lea proteins may act as molecular chaperones or molecular shields and play an important role in the prevention of this aggregation  <cit> . thirteen ests, distributed in three clusters,  were identified as having significant similarity to lea proteins. cluster, aac <dig> which was identified as a singleton matched a previously characterized lea protein from desiccated a. avenae  <cit> . in addition, we also identified multiple copies of cytochrome p <dig>  superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione s-transferase, enzymes involved in protection against oxidative damage. desiccation stress of nematodes caused significant up-regulation of transcripts encoding these genes  <cit> .

functional classification based on gene ontology
gene ontology  has been used widely to predict gene function and classification  <cit> . blast2go  <cit> , a universal, web-based annotation tool was used to assign go terms for the a. avenae cluster sequences, extracting them from each blast hit against swiss-prot obtained by mapping to extant annotation associations.  <dig> sequences out of  <dig>  did not retrieve any blast results within the set e-value threshold . mapping of go terms and annotation were not possible for  <dig> and  <dig> sequences, respectively. the remaining  <dig>   sequences were successfully annotated and mapped to one or more of the three organizing principles of go: biological process, molecular function and cellular component. the matches obtained from this analysis are summarized in figs 4a-4c.

 <dig>  of the a. avenae cluster sequences generated matches in the "molecular function" class,  <dig> in the "biological process" class and  <dig> in the "cellular component" class. within the "biological process" class the "regulation of biological process ", "biosynthetic process " and "transport " categories were the most represented followed by "response to stimulus  ", based on the annotation assigned by blast2go . within the "molecular function" class the "protein binding " term is the most represented followed by "nucleotide binding " and "transferase activity " . many cluster sequences encoding ribosomal proteins as well as highly expressed genes coding for structural molecules  and regulatory molecules  are assigned to the "protein binding" term. since those clusters are abundantly present in the dataset, this may cause overrepresentation of the "protein binding" term. within the "cellular component" class the "mitochondrion " is the most highly represented . a complete listing of go mappings assigned for the a. avenae cluster sequences is provided in additional file  <dig> 

identification of transcripts encoding cell-wall-degrading enzymes
blastx analysis allowed us to identify various genes with significant similarity to genes encoding enzymes which degrade plant and fungal cell walls . the plant cell-wall-degrading enzymes that were identified included cellulase, pectate lyase, polygalacturonase and expansin, while transcripts encoding fungal cell-wall-degrading enzymes included β- <dig> -endoglucanase and chitinase.

eight cellulase genes were present in  <dig> different a. avenae clusters and in all cases homologues were found in other plant parasitic nematodes. one cellulase gene  was identified as a contig of six individual ests. two clusters  contained  <dig> ests each and remaining cellulase clusters were present as a singleton. two types of pectin degrading enzymes: pectate lyase and polygalacturonase were identified . while all transcripts encoding pectate lyase genes were identified as singletons, polygalacturonase clusters contained either single or two individual ests. the features of the sequences of cellulase and pectate lyase are discussed in more detail below.

in addition to the plant cell-wall-degrading enzymes, we identified genes encoding expansin-like proteins in the a. avenae dataset. expansins and expansin-like proteins have recently been described in several plant parasitic nematodes  <cit>  and it is thought that these proteins disrupt non-covalent bonds in the plant cell wall, enhancing the activity of other enzymes such as cellulases. all four expansin-like transcripts were identified as a best match with the expansin genes from the b. xylophilus  <cit> .

two different types of genes, β- <dig> -endoglucanase and chitinase, that could encode enzymes, important in degradation of the fungal cell wall were identified. a gene encoding a β- <dig> -endoglucanase has been cloned and characterized from b. xylophilus  <cit>  and is thought to aid fungal feeding in this nematode. chitinase, an enzyme responsible for breakdown of β- <dig> -glycosidic bonds within chitin, has been found in wide ranges of nematodes. since chitin is known to be present in the eggshell  <cit>  and the microfilarial sheath  <cit>  of nematodes, it has been suggested that chitinases have a role in remodeling processes during the molting of filariae and in the hatching of larvae from the eggshell  <cit> . however, the existence of large families of chitinases in the free-living nematode c. elegans suggests that these enzymes may also fulfill other functions  <cit> . in the plant parasitic nematode, heterodera glycines, chitinase was found to be expressed in the subventral oesophageal gland cells of the parasitic stages of this nematode, suggesting a role in parasitism but not in hatching  <cit> . the fungal feeding plant parasitic b. xylophilus also contains chitinase  <cit> . since β- <dig> -glucan and chitin are the two major structural polysaccharides of the fungal cell-wall, it is possible that fungal feeding nematodes like b. xylophilus and a. avenae secrete these enzymes in order to metabolize or soften the fungal cell wall as part of the feeding process.

characterisation of genes encoding cellulases and pectate lyases; analysis of sequences, phylogentics and expression analysis
cellulase and pectate lyase have been identified and characterized in a wide range of plant parasitic nematodes  <cit> . the presence of genes encoding cell-wall-degrading enzymes in a. avenae opens up a new avenue for further molecular studies aimed at understanding their functional role in this nematode and investigating the origin and evolution of these genes within the nematoda. we therefore cloned the full length cdna and genomic sequences of two putative cellulases  and two putative pectate lyases  and compared these sequences to those from other plant parasitic nematodes.

the full-length sequences of the cellulases were identified from two plasmid clones whose est sequences are part of cluster, aac <dig> . although, six individual ests, form a contig to represent this cluster, one est was selected as it showed a slightly different nucleotide sequence from the other five ests. two different plasmid clones containing the full length cdna sequences of the cellulases were subsequently selected and sequenced using the specific primers listed in table  <dig> 

the aa-eng- <dig> cdna was  <dig>  bp in length  and included a 981-bp open reading frame  that could encode a protein of  <dig> amino acids with an atg start codon at position  <dig> and a tga stop codon at position  <dig>  . the complete cdna of aa-eng- <dig> was  <dig>  bp in length and also contained a potential orf of  <dig> amino acids with an atg start codon at position  <dig> and tga stop codon at  <dig> . a signal peptide of  <dig> amino acids is predicted by signalp  <cit>  at the n terminus of the deduced aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> polypeptides. the predicted molecular masses of the putative mature proteins were  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda respectively and the theoretical pi value was  <dig>  for both proteins. the aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> proteins contained a catalytic domain homologous to ghf <dig> β- <dig> -endoglucanases as predicted by prodom  <cit> . the deduced amino acid sequences showed highest similarity with the ghf <dig> endoglucanase from the migratory plant parasitic nematode radopholus similis . the highest non-nematode similarities of both aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> were with the β- <dig> -endoglucanase from cytophaga hutchinsoni . aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> share 99% identity in their amino acid sequences.

genomic clones of aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> were obtained by pcr amplification using gene-specific primers  and genomic dna as template. the aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> genomic dna products were <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp long respectively from the atg to the stop codon. the position of exon/intron boundaries of the genomic sequences were determined by aligning the genomic sequences with the corresponding cdna sequences. all introns were bordered by canonical cis-splicing sequences  <cit> . five introns were identified in aa-eng- <dig>  of which four introns were small  a feature commonly found in nematodes  <cit> . only the first intron was larger . five introns were also identified in aa-eng- <dig>  the first intron was  <dig> bp long and the length of remaining four introns ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the intron positions of aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> genes were identical to each other.

sequence alignment of the two endoglucanases from a. avenae with ghf <dig> endoglucanases from nematodes and other organisms revealed that both aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> possess a consensus pattern of ghf <dig> endoglucanases in their primary amino acid sequences in which two glutamic acids residues are the predicted proton donor and mucleophile/base of the catalytic site  which is also true for all previously described nematode ghf <dig> endoglucanases. in addition to the catalytic domain some of these proteins contain a cellulose binding domain  joined to the catalytic domain through a linker peptide. the ghf <dig> endoglucanase genes isolated from plant parasitic nematodes have also different structures: all have a signal peptide and catalytic domain, some have an additional linker and cbd and others only have a linker but no cbd  <cit> . however, neither peptide linkers nor cbd domains were present in the two ghf <dig> endoglucanases isolated from a. avenae. expansins from cyst nematodes have also been shown to contain a cbd, but no such domains were predicted in other sequences within the est dataset, including the putative expansins.

a phylogenetic tree was generated from an alignment of the β- <dig> -endoglucanase protein sequences from aa-eng- <dig>  aa-eng- <dig>  cyst and root-knot nematodes, the migratory plant-parasitic nematodes r. similis, pratylenchus penetrans, pratylenchus coffeae and ditylenchus africanus and ghf <dig> cellulases from phytophagous beetles, bacteria and protists . aa-eng- <dig> and aa-eng- <dig> clustered into a larger group of protein sequences including all nematode ghf <dig> cellulases, indicating that a. avenae cellulases are closely related to those of the tylenchida. this analysis supports the idea that all nematode ghf <dig> cellulases evolved from a ghf <dig> sequence acquired by a common ancestor of this group.

the β- <dig> -endoglucanases are the largest family of cell-wall-degrading enzymes that have been identified in parasitic nematodes to date. over the last decade, a large number of ghf <dig> endoglucanases have been identified and extensively studied in plant parasitic tylenchida including cyst and root-knot nematodes  <cit> . genes encoding β- <dig> -endoglucanases have also been found in bursaphelenchus spp but these enzymes are most similar to ghf <dig> cellulases from fungi  <cit> . the presence of ghf <dig> cellulases within a. avenae  provides further support for the suggestion that this nematode is more closely related to the tylenchida than to bursaphelenchus and its relatives.

although the presence of ghf <dig> cellulases within a. avenae can be readily explained given the phylogenetic arguments above, the presence of a β- <dig> -endoglucanase is more surprising. these enzymes act to metabolise the fungal cell wall and have been previously described in bursaphelenchus spp. such genes are not usually present in animals and it was suggested that the bursaphelenchus genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria  <cit> .

no such genes are present in root-knot nematodes  or other tylenchida. it is possible that a fungal feeding common ancestor of aphelenchoidea and tylenchida possessed this gene but that more "advanced" plant parasites have subsequently lost it. further sequencing within both nematode groups is required to resolve this issue.

all the transcripts potentially encoding pectate lyases were identified as singletons . two full-length cdna sequences of pectate lyases, designated aa-pel- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig>  were identified from the plasmid clones corresponding to the cluster ids aac <dig> and aac <dig> respectively. the complete cdna of aa-pel- <dig> was  <dig> bp in length and contained an orf of  <dig> amino acids with a putative atg start codon at position  <dig> and taa stop codon at position  <dig>  a signal peptide of  <dig> amino acids is predicted by signalp  <cit>  at the n-terminus of the putative aa-pel- <dig> amino acid sequence. the mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and theoretical pi of  <dig> .

the full-length aa-pel- <dig> cdna was  <dig> bp long and contained an orf of  <dig> bp with an atg start codon at position  <dig> and a taa stop codon at position  <dig>  an n-terminal signal sequence of  <dig> amino acids predicted by signalp  <cit> . the molecular mass and theoretical pi value of the putative aa-pel- <dig> protein were  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  respectively. aa-pel- <dig> has 61% identity to aa-pel- <dig> 

to obtain genomic sequences, the entire coding regions of aa-pel- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig> gene were amplified from a. avenae gdna using gene specific primers . analysis of these sequences showed that the aa-pel- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig> genes were  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp long respectively from the atg to the stop codon. two introns  were identified in aa-pel- <dig> whereas aa-pel- <dig> contained only one intron  . all introns were bordered by canonical cis-splicing sequences  <cit> . the position of the second intron of aa-pel- <dig> was identical to the intron in aa-pel- <dig> 

the intron position in the a. avenae genes  were compared with other nematode pectate lyase genes. the pectate lyase genes from bursaphelenchus species  each have one intron in their coding region at the same position  <cit> . this position is also identical to the common intron position of the a. avenae genes . moreover, one of the three introns of mi-pel- <dig> from m. incognita is at the same position as that in the a. avenae and bursaphelenchus genes. gr-pel- <dig> from g. rostochiensis has six introns and mi-pel- <dig> from m. incognita has two introns. gr-pel- <dig> and mi-pel- <dig> share two intron positions but none of the introns of these genes have the same position as that in the a. avenae genes .

a protein homology search using the deduced amino acid sequences of aa-pel- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig> using blastp indicated high similarity to the pectate lyases belonging to the the polysaccharide lyase family  <dig>  from plant parasitic nematodes, bacteria and fungi. multiple sequence alignment of aa-pel- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig> with the best matches confirmed that both a. avenae sequences contained the four highly conserved regions characteristic of pl <dig> pectate lyases in bacteria and fungi as well as 8- <dig> cysteine residues and four charged residues  that are potentially involved in catalysis  <cit> . aa-pel- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig> were most similar to the pectate lyases  from the pinewood nematodes b. xylophilus and b. mucronatus   <cit> . a. avenae sequences shared  <dig> to 33% identity with pectate lyases  from cyst and root-knot plant parasitic nematode spp  <cit> , and  <dig> to 45% identity with the sequences from two microbes .

a phylogenetic tree was generated from an alignment of a. avenae pectate lyase sequences with selected proteins belonging to pl <dig> from bacteria, fungi, and nematodes using the maximum likelihood method . both aa-pel- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig> were clustered with the bursaphelenchus genes. other nematode sequences were not monophyletic but were clustered into distinct clades.

the pectate lyase genes from a. avenae are more similar to the bursaphelenchus genes compared to those from cyst and root-knot nematodes . the identical position of the common intron of the a. avenae genes  and introns within pectate lyase genes from bursaphelenchus and m. incognita  suggests that pectate lyase genes from a wide range of plant parasitic nematodes have the same origin. to determine which a. avenae cells express ghf <dig> endoglucanases and pectate lyases, in situ mrna hybridisation was performed . digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes generated from aa-eng- <dig> and aa-pel- <dig> specifically hybridized with the transcripts in the esophageal gland cells of a. avenae . staining was observed in juvenile and adult nematodes rather than being restricted to a specific life stages. no hybridisation was observed with the control  cdna probes of aa-eng- <dig> or aa-pel- <dig> .

as a part of the complex process of parasitism, a wide range of plant parasitic nematodes use endogenous β- <dig> -endoglucanases and pectate lyases to degrade two abundant constituents of the plant cell wall and thus facilitate their migration through host tissues. the presence of signal peptides in the deduced amino acid sequences of the endoglucanases and pectate lyase from a. avenae coupled with their expression in the esophageal glands suggest that both enzymes have a similar role in a. avenae. the presence of such genes in a. avenae suggests that this nematode can enter and migrate through plant tissues and may also be able to feed on plant cell contents. this is backed up by the observation that a. avenae is known to feed on plant tissue in culture  <cit> . a. avenae may therefore have a wide ranging diet that includes fungi and plant tissues. this, coupled with the position of this nematode as a basal member of a clade that includes a wide range of plant parasitic nematodes, provides further support for the idea that plant parasitism has evolved from fungal feeding and suggests that a. avenae, may be a very primitive plant feeder.

CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig>  ests identified in this study represent the first attempt to define the a. avenae gene set and represents over  <dig>  genes. this collection of ests represents a starting point for studies in a number of different fundamental and applied areas. a summary of the assignment of nonredundant ests to functional categories as well as their relative abundance are listed and discussed. a substantial number of putative aphelenchus-specific genes were found that do not share similarity with known genes and some of these may be highly expressed, based on their abundance in the est dataset. the presence of genes encoding a battery of cell-wall-degrading enzymes in a. avenae and their similarities with the genes from other plant parasitic nematodes suggest that this nematode can act not only as a fungal feeder but also as a plant parasite. the gene structures of ghf <dig> cellulase and pl <dig> pectate lyase from a. avenae, their phylogenetics and comparative analyses with similar genes from other parasitic nematodes provides information that helps understand the evolutionary origins of these genes within the nematoda. further studies on genes encoding cell-wall-degrading enzymes in a. avenae will accelerate our understanding of the complex evolutionary histories of plant parasitism and the use of genes obtained by horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes.
