BACKGROUND
metamorphosis describes the “change in form” associated with the transition between life cycle stages in a wide range of animal taxa . this transition can be accompanied by modifications in morphology, physiology, behavior, habitat and feeding mode. the endocrine system and in particular the thyroid hormones , thyroxin  and triiodothyronine , play a central role in vertebrate metamorphosis acting as transcription factors  when they bind to their receptors. in amphibian metamorphosis, it is well established that ths directly or indirectly stimulate apoptosis and resorption of larval tissue and also promote growth, differentiation and remodelling of tissues that are crucial for the adult life form  <cit> . for instance, ths are involved in the control of muscle fibre apoptosis in the amphibian tail during its regression and also promote development of the limbs  <cit> . in amphibians the change in feeding habit from herbivore to carnivore during the transition from tadpole to frog is associated with th driven remodelling of the intestine that changes from a long coiled tube into a complex differentiated organ . similarly, ths modulate the change in the amphibian integument from a simple to a stratified structure that is better adapted to terrestrial life  <cit> .

teleost fish also undergo a th driven metamorphosis that marks the larval to juvenile transition  <cit> . however, the term is more generally applied to the profound modifications associated with the change from bilateral symmetry to asymmetry during the larval-juvenile transition of flatfish  . in flatfish metamorphosis the external morphology is dramatically transformed and they change from symmetric pelagic larvae to asymmetric benthic juveniles with both eyes on the upper, ocular side of the head . the external transformation in flatfish morphology is accompanied by a plethora of changes in the structure and function of tissues and organs. chemical disruption of the thyroid axis using thiourea or methimazole  delays or stops stomach development in the japanese flounder   <cit>  and otolith mineralization in the southern flounder   <cit> . the importance of ths during metamorphosis is further emphasized in other flatfish species where they have been shown to be important for the maturation of the muscle, stomach and skin .

flatfish have a high economic value and include species such as the atlantic halibut , common sole , senegalese sole , turbot  and the half-smooth tongue sole . overfishing and high consumer demand for flatfish has made them an interesting target for aquaculture production and a better understanding of metamorphosis is of direct relevance for their efficient and successful production. specific problems linked to failures during metamorphosis include feeding difficulties, reduced growth rate, arrested metamorphosis, abnormal pigmentation , failed migration of the eye and skeletal deformities . control of hatchery production requires an understanding of fish biology but also a comprehension of the mediators of metamorphosis, such as the ths and potentially other endocrine factors. although there are numerous studies of flatfish metamorphosis, the endocrine and molecular basis of the tissue-specific modifications and the timing of the cascade of events that lead to metamorphosis are still largely unknown. moreover, experiments that have blocked the thyroid axis during metamorphosis with drugs such as mmi do not significantly modify larval viability suggesting thyroid dependent  and independent processes underpin this event. a complex task now lies ahead in establishing which developmental processes during metamorphosis are fully th dependent and which genetic pathways and endocrine systems cross-talk with ths. furthermore, it remains to be established how profoundly different processes such as skin maturation, eye migration and craniofacial remodelling or gastrointestinal tract  development can be regulated by the same endocrine factors.

one of the challenges of studying metamorphosis in fish larvae is their relatively small dimension, which means pools of larvae rather than individuals or tissues have generally been used which significantly reduces the resolution of such studies. the advantage of the biggest of flatfish, the atlantic halibut, is the large size of the larvae and their slow metamorphosis , which means it is possible to analyze individuals or individual tissues. this is advantageous as pools of larvae contain a mixture of tissues and frequently contain individuals at different developmental stages making resolution of tissue specific changes in transcripts and proteins during metamorphosis difficult or impossible.

the working hypothesis of the present study is that since ths exert their action by binding to thyroid receptors that are ligand activated tfs the overt change in flatfish during metamorphosis will be preceded by significant modifications in the transcriptome of responsive tissues. for this reason, large scale analysis of tissue-specific transcriptional changes in responsive tissue should provide insight into the underlying molecular changes of tissue specific maturation. a  <dig> pyrosequencing approach was used to survey the tissue specific transcriptomes in the skin, gi-tract and head of metamorphosing atlantic halibut and to also generate a reference transcriptome. solid technology was then used to map the transcriptional changes in individuals  at different stages of metamorphosis. differentially expressed  transcripts during metamorphosis were identified by comparing the transcriptome at metamorphic stages  with juvenile  stages. subsequently, genes of the thyroid axis, th-responsive transcripts and candidate genes that underpin remodelling and maturation of tissues during metamorphosis were identified and analyzed by quantitative pcr .

RESULTS
 <dig> transcriptome sequencing
transcriptome annotation
in spite of stringent quality control of the rna used for  <dig> library construction, the number of reads resulting from the stage-specific libraries for skin, gi-tract and head of atlantic halibut post-embryonic larvae at different metamorphic stages was highly variable. a total of  <dig> mbp were produced for the tissue assemblies using mira v <dig>  and they assembled into  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , contigs for skin, gi-tract, and head, respectively. the contigs from the skin, gi-tract and head tissue assemblies were submitted to an iterative stringent four-step local blast approach . the tissue assemblies were successfully annotated and for the gi-tract library 60 % of the initial contigs had a good blast match after the first  <dig> annotation steps and 57 % of the contigs were annotated for the skin and head libraries . most of the contigs were successfully annotated in the first step of blastx against the zebrafish refseq protein db.table  <dig> summary of the blast results used for annotation of the head, skin and gi-tract assembly



gene ontology and kegg analysis
the active transcriptome in each tissue analyzed was assumed to be equivalent to the number of contigs identified . comparative analyses between the transcriptomes revealed that  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were unique to the skin, gi-tract and head assembly, respectively. in addition,  <dig>  transcripts were common between the three tissues. the head and skin, head and gi-tract and gi-tract and skin shared a further  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, respectively .fig.  <dig> atlantic halibut skin, gastrointestinal tract and head transcriptome annotation. a venn diagram of common and unique tissue transcripts ; b venn diagram representing the common and specific tissue gene ontology  terms ; c diagram representing the relative abundance of shared and tissue specific enriched go terms by go category 



the complete functional  annotation for the skin, gi-tract and head transcriptomes  assigned a total of  <dig>  different go terms to the three tissue assemblies. comparisons of the assigned go terms for the skin, gi-tract and head transcriptome assemblies revealed  <dig>  common go terms and  <dig> identified only in the skin,  <dig> only in the gi-tract and  <dig>  only in the head . the most abundant go terms  for biological process , molecular function  and cellular component  showed no major differences between skin, gi-tract and head . cellular process , metabolic process  and biological regulation  were the most representative go terms in the category biological processes. other key biological processes linked to development , localization , signaling , cell proliferation  and death  were also found .

for molecular function, the most abundant go terms  in the skin and head transcriptomes were binding, catalytic activity and structural molecule activity . for the gi-tract transcriptome, binding and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity were the most frequent mf go terms. the exception was the gi-tract for which go terms specific for dna binding transcription factor activity  were more highly represented, when compared to the other tissues . within the cellular component category, the most represented go terms in the three tissues transcriptomes were cell, organelle, macromolecule complex and membrane .

fisher’s exact tests were applied to detect significantly over/under-represented go terms resulting from analysis of the tissue-specific transcriptomes . comparison of the overall go enrichment for the tissue specific transcriptome revealed that the highest enrichment was associated with the bp category , followed by the mf category . of the  <dig>  enriched go terms identified for the tissue transcriptomes,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  were from skin, gi-tract, and head, respectively. figure 1c shows the representative enriched go terms for each tissue assembly for bp, mf, and cc gene ontology categories. the halibut head transcriptome had the highest enrichment of bp go terms  and they corresponded to  <dig>  % of the overall go terms for this tissue, followed by the gi-tract  and the skin  . similarly, mf go terms were most enriched in the head  relative to the skin  and the gi-tract .

in the skin transcriptome, go terms related to the muscle system, development and morphogenetic processes, including epidermis development, appendage morphogenesis, and transcripts involved in cellular response to hormone stimulus were overrepresented along with immune development and pigmentation . significant go categories in the gi-tract that were overrepresented included digestion, proteolysis and lipid metabolism such as the cholesterol metabolic process and triglyceride mobilization . in the head transcriptome, significantly overrepresented go terms included development of the nervous system, spinal cord and otoliths, cartilage and endochondral bone. in addition, head-specific go terms, such as pituitary gland development and thyroid hormone metabolic processes were also significantly overrepresented .

revigo clustering of enriched biological process go terms for the skin transcriptome identified phosphocreatine metabolism and response to lipopolysaccharides and biotic stimulus. in revigo clustering of enriched bp go terms in the gi-tract transcriptome identified digestion, cell proliferation, rrna transcription, lipid storage and immune system and response . in the head, transcriptome revigo clustering of enriched bp go categories identified nervous system development , blood vessel morphogenesis, and immune and defense response .

more than  <dig> metabolic pathways were identified via kegg mapping comprising ~ <dig>  different enzyme codes and more than  <dig>  of the atlantic halibut contigs matched an enzyme code  . overall, there was considerable similarity in the metabolic pathway enrichment between the three tissues but this was unsurprising since many of the pathways were linked to cellular metabolism. of note was the lower representation of sphingolipids, inositol lipid and phospholipid pathways in the gi-tract. the gi-tract, a soft tissue, had a notable reduction compared to the skin and head of metabolic pathways involved in chondrogenic matrix generation but had an increase in starch and sucrose metabolic pathways relative to the head .

tissue development/morphogenesis – identification of putative tissue-specific genes
blast of the skin transcriptome against the in-house skin-specific database that contained genes characteristic of skin in other vertebrates identified  <dig> transcripts for skin development and morphogenesis and  <dig> for pigmentation . abundant transcripts included the collagens , genes involved in pigmentation, melanocyte differentiation and melanosome transport , . several signal transduction pathways were identified in the skin transcriptome including notch , wnt  and sonic hedgehog   .table  <dig> genes in vertebrate skin development and pigmentation identified in the atlantic halibut skin transcriptome

discussion
changes during flatfish metamorphosis are not limited to modifications in external morphology but include many structural and functional modifications. the role of trs as ligand activated tfs means that a significant part of the action of ths on tissues is associated with tissue specific modifications in the transcriptome. in the present study, the large size of atlantic halibut was utilized to establish for the first time in flatfish specific transcriptomes for larval skin, gi-tract and head during metamorphosis using  <dig> sequencing. solid sequencing of individual larvae  and stage specific comparisons  revealed a very low number of de transcripts and no sudden or dramatic change between any particular stage. in contrast, pairwise comparisons of the juvenile transcriptome with stage specific transcriptomes revealed a high number of de transcripts , with the majority highly up-regulated in the juvenile stage.

comparisons of the approximately  <dig>  differential transcripts per stage generated a stage specific molecular fingerprint. the large majority of de transcripts  were not classified as th-responsive and presumably represented transcripts underlying ontogenetic changes and belonging to gene networks that lead to the overt changes that accompany metamorphosis. the latter probably explains why blocking th action with mmi during flatfish metamorphosis is not lethal and only modifies the development of some specific tissues  <cit> . in line with this observation ths maintain neoteny in only some of the tissues in salamanders . the link between th-responsive pathways and the numerous other gene networks that change during metamorphosis was not established in the present study, but in future studies will be explored. the majority of the putative de th-responsive genes clustered in specific metamorphic stages rather than over the duration of metamorphosis. the response of the majority of putative th-responsive transcripts was none synchronous with the peak in whole body th levels, previously reported to occur at stage  <dig> and  <dig> for atlantic halibut  <cit> . the non-synchronous tissue specific response of putative th-responsive genes during metamorphosis suggests the chronology of tissue responsiveness during metamorphosis may vary, presumably as a result of differences in cellular responsiveness to ths. such a phenomenon was reported in a recent study of gi-tract development in the atlantic halibut  <cit> .

metamorphosis-specific tissue transcriptome
next-generation pyrosequencing  <dig> technology has been used to characterize the transcriptome from several flatfish species. in turbot  the study focused on immune related transcripts  <cit> , in the common sole a pooled larval and adult liver and gi-tract transcriptome was established  <cit>  and in senegalese sole and common sole reference transcriptomes were derived by sequencing several tissue from juveniles and adults  <cit> . an oligo-array study of common sole development from larva to juvenile revealed a large variety of biological processes occurred during development and that some genes of the thyroid axis were associated with the initiation of metamorphosis  <cit> .

to our knowledge, ours is the first next generation sequencing study analyzing individual tissues and larvae of a metamorphosing flatfish. more than  <dig>  sequences per specific-tissue were obtained after filtering to remove poor quality sequences and contaminating transcripts . this data substantially increases available molecular resources for atlantic halibut  <cit> . mira <dig> assembly of the tissue transcriptomes  generated  <dig> ;  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs for head, skin and gi-tract, respectively, which was similar to previous studies using the same sequencing strategy  <cit> , but higher than the gene content of the genome of model teleost species e.g.  <dig>  for takifugu rubripes and  <dig>  for danio rerio . technical issues, read length and the heuristic nature of the assembly methods, no doubt explain the relatively high transcript number as was previously observed in a liver transcriptome study of zoarces viviparus  <cit> . transcript annotation levels in atlantic halibut were similar to previous  <dig> studies in turbot, seabream, european eel and silver carp  <cit> ; the contribution of alternative splicing to the high number of assembled transcripts was not established in the study.

candidate biological processes and pathways during metamorphosis
knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the global molecular and cellular changes during fish development, including functional gene annotation during metamorphosis, has significantly increased in the last decade due to genomics and transcriptomics technologies. previous studies using microarrays, expressed sequence tags  and candidate genes in atlantic halibut identified genes involved in muscle, skin, immune system, signal transduction and transcription factor activity in adult and larvae, but information about larvae undergoing metamorphosis is limited  <cit> . studies in solea senegalensis focusing more on metamorphosis generated  <dig>  ests  <cit>  that are enriched in transcripts involved in the reorganization of somatic tissues, such as, ribosomal proteins, elongation factors and cytoskeletal proteins. the global gene ontology of the individual tissue transcriptomes characterized in the present study, are far more detailed than previous est studies, but where there is coincident sequence data the results are similar. the go results of metamorphosing atlantic halibut is similar to results for other developing teleosts   <cit> , but also between sexes , whole fish  <cit>  and fish under diverse challenges   <cit> , suggesting maintenance of tissue, organ and organism function involves an overwhelming number of common genes that emerge irrespective of the experimental situation. to overcome this problem in the present study we applied a fisher’s exact test to identify significantly over/under-represented go terms for the tissue-specific transcriptomes of metamorphosing atlantic halibut. the  <dig> transcriptome approach gave insight into tissue specific molecular changes and allied to solid analysis of several individuals/stage revealed core th-responsive genes responsible for the timing of stage specific responses of individual tissues.

the metamorphosing atlantic halibut skin transcriptome: is enriched in go terms related to epidermis and connective tissue development, appendage morphogenesis and pigmentation, which is concordant with the morphological modifications observed  <cit> . genes involved in vertebrate skin development and morphogenesis are also enriched and include components of the extracellular matrix , ecm remodeling  and ecm degradation . several of the enriched ecm proteins in skin are responsive to ths  and in solid analysis their de pattern in stages is asynchronous presumably because of their association with opposing biological processes. the th-responsive proteins together with the detected th-independent growth factors, chemokines, adhesion molecules and proteoglycans have previously been identified in relation to tissue differentiation, development and morphogenesis in vertebrate skin  <cit> .

mmp genes identified for the first time in atlantic halibut skin may be associated with larval-type cell apoptosis during ecm degradation as previously reported in xenopus. for example, collagenase  <dig>  has an important role in xenopus body skin remodelling during metamorphosis  <cit>  and this transcript is present in the halibut larval skin transcriptome and is de in solid analysis of several individuals/stage with a significant reduction post-metamorphosis. pathways involved in “focal adhesion” and “tight junction” are also de in pools of pre-metamorphic solea solea  <cit> . the enriched transcripts identified during atlantic halibut metamorphosis that contribute to pigmentation are of practical interest as abnormal pigmentation can have a significant impact on commercial production of flatfish  <cit> .

the gi-tract in metamorphosing atlantic halibut: undergoes extensive remodeling to prepare it for the shift in habitat and diet of the juvenile  <cit> . solid analysis revealed de of digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and phospholipase a <dig> during atlantic halibut metamorphosis, as previously reported in other fish species  <cit> . our enriched go results for gi-tract development in atlantic halibut are similar to that reported in xenopus, in which go terms related to digestion are “shut down” at metamorphic climax, but increase again at the end of metamorphosis  <cit> . the results of the present study corroborate those of a detailed study of gi-tract development in atlantic halibut that linked up-regulation of pepsinogen and h+/k+-atpase α and β subunit with acquisition of a functional proteolytic stomach in early juveniles  <cit> . however our results diverge from those of an earlier atlantic halibut microarray study in which genes involved in digestion are more abundant in larvae entering metamorphosis  <cit> , and this may be a consequence of differences in staging, sample composition  and the more comprehensive results possible with ngs.

the head transcriptome: the enrichment in the head transcriptome of bone related genes ties in with experiments in paralichthys lethostigma in which the development and growth of both sacculus and utricle otoliths are th dependent during metamorphosis  <cit> . alpha-tectorin, otolin and plasma membrane calcium atpase are also enriched in the atlantic halibut head transcriptome and a previous candidate gene study suggested they are th-responsive during flatfish metamorphosis  <cit> . several tfs specific for thyroid gland development, such as homeobox protein nk <dig> , hematopoietically expressed homeobox  and pax <dig> are enriched in the atlantic halibut head transcriptome  <cit> , and suggests that modification of the thyroid tissue is essential for successful metamorphosis  <cit>  and disruption of this process may explain failed metamorphosis in some cases.

enriched pathways in metamorphosing atlantic halibut: revealed as expected that the essential signaling pathways that trigger tissue development and cell proliferation and differentiation  , are well represented in all three tissue transcriptomes. this fact lends support to the idea that in atlantic halibut it is probably not remodeling that gives rise to juvenile tissue but rather de novo tissue development during metamorphosis, as has been demonstrated in xenopus . several of the signaling pathways are regulated by ths and specific studies will be required to establish their precise mode of action and the tissue specific consequences of their up-regulation.

the majority of de genes detected by solid analysis of several individual halibut larvae per stage: during metamorphosis are not directly th-responsive, suggesting that many of the th effects may be indirect. cross-referencing of putative th-responsive genes in whole larvae with the tissue specific transcriptomes provides insight into core tissue changes during metamorphosis. the down-regulation of transcripts linked to the mapk signalling cascade  during metamorphosis suggests the coordination of th actions may be via modulation of signalling pathways as has been suggested in xenopus  <cit> . similarly, modification in tfs may be another way in which ths bring about an indirect effect. thus fos-related antigen- <dig> , sox <dig>  tfpa <dig>  tgfb, hmg <dig>  cebpd, gtf2h, nfix and gtf2f that are all th-responsive  peaked at metamorphic climax . this is also reminiscent of what occurs during xenopus laevis metamorphosis where tfs have a central role in tissue specific th-induced programs .

the reliability of the results of solid de analysis is generally confirmed by comparison to the results of previous candidate gene studies in fish and amphibians. for example, osteonectin , that plays an essential role in tissue morphogenesis  is strongly down-regulated in stage  <dig>  but its abundance increases at metamorphic climax stage 9a  and this is reminiscent of what occurs in the flatfish scophthalmus maximus  <cit> . de ecm transcripts  during atlantic halibut metamorphosis linked with epidermal outgrowth  <cit>  are also modified in amphibian metamorphosis  <cit> . the stage specific fingerprint of de th-responsive and nonresponsive genes generated by solid analysis of several individuals per stage during atlantic halibut metamorphosis is a rich resource for future studies of the metamorphic process and its evolution  <cit> . furthermore, although in general metamorphosis is comparable between fish and amphibians their divergent evolution, biology and physiology  <cit>  makes flatfish specific data for this process a priority.

confirmation of the th axis role in atlantic halibut metamorphosis
in flatfish, initiation of metamorphosis is associated with a surge in t <dig> and t <dig>  which increases up until the metamorphic climax and decreases in post-climax stages . the failure to detect by ngs analysis de genes of the thyroid axis in the present and previous studies of flatfish metamorphosis may be a result of: i) their generally low tissue abundance, which is further aggravated by, ii) the dilution effect caused by using mrna from whole larvae  rather than discrete tissue and iii) the asynchronous temporal expression pattern in different tissues. nonetheless, tg transcript abundance detected by qpcr in the present study mirrored the th profiles in metamorphosing atlantic halibut  <cit>  and is reminiscent of what occurs in senegalese sole  <cit> . unsurprisingly, transcription of deiodinases , that encode selenoproteins that activate and inactivate ths  changed during metamorphosis. the results for dio expression agreed with previous studies of metamorphosis in the atlantic halibut  <cit>  and senegalese sole  <cit> . a limitation of the present study is the impossibility of mapping the spatial and temporal pattern of deiodinase mrna localization, which is known to be tightly controlled in flounder metamorphosis  <cit> . the spatial distribution of deiodinases probably contributes to the asynchronous pattern of de genes during metamorphosis.

in the atlantic halibut qpcr revealed that the recently identified th transmembrane transporters  proteins ), mct <dig> and mct <dig>  that regulate th availability in peripheral tissues, are expressed in metamorphosing atlantic halibut. however, only mct <dig>  a specific th transporter , is significantly up-regulated during the metamorphic climax  and significantly decreases in post-metamorphic juveniles. the results in atlantic halibut suggest that in common with metamorphosis in the amphibian  the tissue distribution and abundance of slc proteins is one of the factors explaining the differential tissue responsiveness to ths .

in the atlantic halibut, trs had a variable expression pattern during metamorphosis as observed in other flatfish species  <cit>  and this is intriguing when placed in the context of the duality model of tr actions during vertebrate development  <cit> . in this model, trα is the predominant tr form during the xenopus larval phase and is associated with repression of th-inducible genes. repression of th-responsive genes occurs when tr and retinoid x receptor  bind to thyroid response elements  and in the absence of t <dig> recruit a co-repressor complex , silencing mediator for rar and tr , and other proteins). at metamorphosis the presence of t <dig> leads to substitution of the co-repressor complex by co-activator proteins and th-responsive gene transcription is induced. this event is concomitant with trβ up-regulation . in atlantic halibut, our results suggest a dual tr activity model may also exist as trαb is the main tr form expressed in premetamorphic stages, while trβ is more abundant at the metamorphic climax. in addition, solid analysis reveals de of co-activator and repressor elements  of trs during metamorphosis.

in summary, although significant changes in transcripts of the thyroid axis are not detected using solid transcriptome analysis, the temporal expression pattern of dio, th transporters and trs varied dramatically between larvae at different stages confirming the importance of the th axis in atlantic halibut metamorphosis  <cit> . in metamorphosing frogs changes in dios, th transporters and trs are correlated with the timing of tissue specific changes during metamorphosis  <cit> . the results of our study and those on frog highlight the importance of analysing individuals and tissues rather than pools of individuals if flatfish metamorphosis is to be understood.

CONCLUSIONS
we report for the first time the tissues specific  transcriptomes during metamorphosis of a flatfish species hippoglossus hippoglossus with a high economic value. the study contributes substantially to the molecular resources available for this species and will be an important tool for identifying new potential molecular markers for solving problems related to atlantic halibut production during metamorphosis. the atlantic halibut skin transcriptome is a powerful resource for studying the asymmetric pigmentation pattern, as well as the putative cross-talk with the ths axis. questions relating to the possible asymmetric responsiveness to the ths of both ocular and abocular  sides of skin during metamorphosis remain to be resolved.

the candidate th-responsive genes identified in the transcriptomes generated will be the subject of future studies to assess tissues responsiveness, and how it is correlated with temporal changes in elements of th signaling and metabolism during flatfish metamorphosis. further studies will be essential to identify the tissue specific mechanisms underlying the timing and programming of the developmental events occurring during metamorphosis. the involvement of ths in a late developmental event, metamorphosis, highlights an emerging research area: the regulatory role of hormones in early development.
