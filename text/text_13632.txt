BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of endogenous non-coding rnas of around  <dig> nucleotides  in length. they play a role as post-transcriptional regulators, partially or completely complementary binding to messenger rna transcripts , usually resulting in direct degradation or translational repression of target genes
 <cit> . in eukaryotes, mirnas are involved in a broad variety of biological processes
 <cit> , such as embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. to date, more than twenty thousand mirnas from  <dig> species have been registered in the mirbase 
 <cit> . mirnas are usually highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom
 <cit> . they have been continuously added to metazoan genomes. the emergence of vertebrates is characterized by a strong increase in mirna families, and correlates with the increase in vertebrate morphological complexity
. therefore, mirnas may have significantly contributed to phenotypic evolution in animals. recently, a high rate of the loss of conserved mirna loci has been found in the nematodes and the flatworms
 <cit> . this result suggested that the mirna losses in platyhelminths are not random events. however, to date, there is no report about the mechanisms of mirna losses in metazoan phylogenetics.

echinococcus granulosus is a flatworm and member of the platyhelminthes, and is the causative agent of cystic echinococcosis , a disease that is distributed throughout most areas of the world
 <cit> . currently, up to  <dig> million people are infected with e. granulosus
 <cit> , and, in some areas, 10% of the population has detectable hydatid cysts by abdominal ultrasound and chest x-ray
 <cit> . this tapeworm requires two mammalian hosts to complete its life cycle. the mature adult worm resides in the small intestine of a carnivore  and releases worm segments or proglottides containing hundreds of eggs which contaminate vegetation and water. when the eggs are swallowed by an intermediate host such as a sheep, the eggs hatch to release larval oncospheres into the digestive tract which are activated by bile and gastrointestinal enzymes. the activated oncospheres penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate via the circulatory system to various organs . in these organs, the oncospheres develop into hydatid cysts over many months and the cysts generate brood capsules within which protoscoleces  are produced asexually. the cycle is completed when a canine  definitive host swallows psc present in the hydatid cysts in infected offal, and the psc develop into adult worms in the small intestine
 <cit> .

although the life cycle of e. granulosus is well known, the mechanisms underlying the main developmental events throughout remain largely unclear. our previous study of the transcriptome of e. granulosus revealed that  <dig>  genes were up- or down-regulated in adult, psc and cyst stages
 <cit> . moreover, a global proteomic analysis of the expression characteristics of e. granulosus in larval and adult stages identified  <dig> adult-specific and  <dig> psc-specific proteins
 <cit> . these studies suggested that transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are pivotal in the control of e. granulosus development.

in regards to flatworms, mirnas have been experimentally identified in schmidtea mediterranea
 <cit> , schistosoma japonicum
 and schistosoma mansoni
 <cit> . a pcr-based cloning study identified  <dig> mature mirnas in psc and the cystic stage of e. granulosus
 <cit> . however, due to the hitherto restricted experimental methods and the limited genomic information available, the numbers and expression profile of e. granulosus mirnas are still unclear. here, we used next generation sequencing technology  to further explore the diversity of e. granulosus mirnas and their expression patterns in different life stages. we expand the mirna repertoire of e. granulosus and identify new mirna encoding loci. through comparing mirna families in the platyhelminths, we found that the losses of e. granulosus mirnas may be associated with the loss of ciliated cells, the gut and sensory organs. the results significantly enhance our knowledge of mirna species in e. granulosus and provide insights into mirna evolution, biogenesis, and expression in parasites generally.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of three small rna libraries from e. granulosus
to investigate the composition of small rnas and the dynamic changes of mirna expression during e. granulosus development, three small rna libraries were constructed from adults, psc and cyst membrane, and sequenced using solexa sequencing technology. after removing low-quality sequences, adaptor contaminants and rnas smaller than  <dig> nts, we obtained  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads of small rnas sized 18– <dig> nts from adults, psc and cyst membrane, respectively [additional file
1: table s1]. of these reads,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were  <dig> to  <dig> nts in length , which is the typical size range for dicer-derived products
 <cit> . through sequence mapping,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from the three libraries perfectly matched to e. granulosus genome
 <cit> , [additional file
1: table s2]. after discarding known non-coding rnas, such as rrna, trna, snorna, repeat-associated rna, and degraded fragments of mrnas, the remaining  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> small rna reads from adults, psc and cyst membrane, respectively, were used to search for both known and novel mirnas  [additional file

identification of known and novel mirnas from e. granulosus
to date,  <dig> mature mirnas of e. granulosus have been identified
 <cit>  and are included in the mirbase database  <dig>  . by deep sequencing, we found that all of the known mature mirnas were present in our data sets [additional file
1: table s3], the majority being abundant in all three libraries. furthermore, we also identified  <dig> mirna stars from the known mirna precursors [additional file
1: table s3].

in addition to known mirnas, we also used mirdeep <dig> to predict and score novel mirna precursors
 <cit>  and identified  <dig> mirna candidates encoding  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna stars [additional file
1: table s <dig> and s5]. all these mirnas can be folded into characteristic mirna stem-loop secondary hairpin structures and have a 1-2 nt 3′overhang pattern generated by dicer cleavage during mature mirna generation [additional file
2]. we evaluated evolutionary conservations by homologous searches to known metazoan mirnas and found  <dig> pre-mirnas were classified into known families based on their precursor sequences, whereas  <dig> did not show homology with other mirnas. we further matched these predicted pre-mirna candidates to the e. multilocularis genome  and found  <dig> of  <dig> mirna candidates were evolutionarily conserved  in both species [additional file
1: table s6]. to validate the novel mirnas, we randomly selected  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna stars, and conducted stem-loop rt-pcr
 <cit> . all the selected mirnas were expressed in e. granulosus [additional file
3: figure s1], suggesting that the filter criteria were sufficiently strict for predicting novel mirnas.

mirna clusters are a group of mirna genes located within a proximal distance on a chromosome
 <cit> . in the present study, besides two published mirna clusters, mir-71/2b/2d and mir-277/4988
 <cit> , we identified two additional mirna clusters located in closed loci  in the genomes of both e. granulosus and e. multilocularis . one cluster consists of four homologous novel mirnas  in the positive strand , while the other one is composed of new- <dig> and new- <dig> in the reverse strand . multiple sequence alignments of the precursors of these novel mirnas showed that they contained similar sequence at the ‘seed region’ [additional file
4: figure s2], which indicated that they may play similar roles in target regulation and belong to the same family.figure  <dig>

comparison of mirna families of e. granulosuswith other flatworms
it is now well established that many mirnas come in families with the same seed sequences 
 <cit> . from our  <dig> novel and  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> different mirna families representing  <dig> mirnas were classified. of these,  <dig> families had been expected in the flatworms
 <cit> , including one which is characteristic for eumetazoa,  <dig> from bilateria,  <dig> from protostomia and one from lophotrochozoa . this result was much more than the  <dig> mirna families finding in a study by fromm et al.
 <cit> . interestingly, the remaining one mirna family  is only present in e. granulosus, s. mansoni and s. japonicum.figure  <dig>

we then compared the presence or absence of the conserved mirna families of e. granulosus  with three other flatworms, s. mediterranea 
 <cit> , gyrodactylus salaris 
 <cit>  and s. japonicum 
 <cit> . similar to the previous study
 <cit> ,  <dig> conserved bilaterian, protostomian, and lophotrochozoan mirna families were not detected in the four flatworms ; these were mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> mirnas families, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were only detected in the free living flatworm s. mediterranea, but not in g. salaris, e. granulosus and s. japonicum. finally, there are  <dig> mirna families  that are present in s. mediterranea and g. salaris, but are absent in s. japonicum and e. granulosus.

expression profiles of mirnas in the three life stages of e. granulosus
combining all detected known and novel mirnas,  <dig> pre-mirnas coding  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna stars were identified in all the e. granulosus libraries [additional file
1: table s7]. we used the ‘transcripts per million’  approach to normalize the abundance value of each mirna [additional file
1: table s8]
 <cit> . through further evaluating the relative abundance of the mature mirnas, we found mir- <dig> was the most abundant mirna with over  <dig>  reads in each library , which was similar to the mirna patterns in s. japonicum
 <cit>  and c. elegans
 <cit> . whereas most of the conserved mirnas were expressed constitutively at all development stages, more non-conserved mirnas were stage-specifically expressed in e. granulosus.table  <dig>

the expression analysis showed that  <dig> mirnas, comprising  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna stars, exhibited statistically significant changes  in at least one of the three life-stages during e. granulosus development  [additional file
1: table s9]. further evaluation of the expression patterns indicated that  <dig> mirnas were mainly expressed in the adult worms and six of them  are derived from the two new mirna clusters [additional file
5: figure s3]. we used stem-loop real-time quantification rt-pcr to examine the expression of  <dig> randomly selected mature mirnas and mirna stars and  <dig> mirnas were shown to be in accordance with the expression profiles detected by the illumina sequencing [additional file

since the larval psc is an important transition life cycle stage, capable of developing either into an adult worm in the dog gastrointestinal tract or a secondary hydatid cyst in the intermediate host, we compared the expression levels of mirnas in adult worms or cyst membrane with those in the psc. a total of  <dig> mirnas  in adult tissue and  <dig> mirnas  in the cyst membrane were identified . further removing similar trends of mirna expression between adults vs psc and cyst vs psc, we found that  <dig> mirnas  and  <dig> mirnas  were specifically changed in the adult and cyst stage, respectively . amongst these,  <dig> mirnas appeared to show reverse trends in expression in the adult and cyst stages compared with psc; mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-4989*, new-17*, new- <dig> and new-87* were up-regulated in adult worms but down-regulated in cyst membrane. in contrast, mir-124a and mir-124b were down-regulated in the former stage but up-regulated in the latter [additional file
1: table s11]. these results imply that mirna expression variation in the different life stages may be associated with the direction of development of psc into either an adult worm or a secondary hydatid cyst.

target gene prediction and functional analysis
to assign biological functions to the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, we predicted putative target genes using the miranda program
 <cit> . based on previously published est sequences
 <cit> , we found  <dig>  genes possibly targeted by  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna stars [additional file
1: table s12]. by enrichment analyses on the predicted targets, we determined that  <dig> genes could be categorized into  <dig> significant go terms  [additional file
1: table s13]. the major target genes in the biological process categories were involved in the regulation of cell differentiation , determination of adult lifespan  and response to nutrient . these results support our premise that the differentially expressed mirnas may have important functions in the three different life cycle stages of e. granulosus.

by using real-time quantitative pcr, we observed that some differentially expressed mirnas had obvious negative correlations with their target gene expression. for example, a high expressed mir- <dig> and a down-regulation of its target gene atp2b <dig>  were simultaneously detected in the adult stage . moreover, in the adult and cyst stages of e. granulosus, obvious negative correlations were also observed between the expression of mir- <dig> and its putative target gene long-chain acyl-coa synthetase  . finally, we observed a clear positive correlation between the expression of let- <dig> and its putative target gene vitamin d receptor  .figure  <dig>

discussion
in the current study, we performed deep sequencing of small rnas in three distinct developmental stages of e. granulosus. by bowtie mapping, there are  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> 18–30 nt reads were located the e. granulosus genome, respectively. the remaining 40% unmapped reads could be ascribed to the following reasons:  some genetic polymorphisms may occur in the e. granulosus genome which interferes with bowtie mapping;  unsatisfactory available genome data; some sequences are probably absent in the current draft genome of e. granulosus
 <cit> ;  mirnas sequencing errors. ngs may randomly produce some base calling errors and influence the accuracy of short reads;  post-transcriptional editing of mirnas may also have contributed to the mismatches observed.

it has been previously reported that the gain of mirna genes in metazoan species is associated with an increase in morphological complexity
 <cit> . however, a high rate of the loss of conserved mirna loci has been found in many subgroups of the platyhelminthes
 <cit> . basing on evolutionary conservation analysis, we also found a significant loss of conserved mirnas in the cestoda. a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families were confirmed as not detectable in e. granulosus, suggesting that the loss of conserved mirna loci in flatworms is not a random event in metazoan phylogenetics. it might relate to loss of targets in the corresponding species
 <cit>  or reduced morphological complexity
 <cit> . a previous study revealed that mirna invention is closely related to the evolution of tissue identities in bilaterian species
 <cit> . through comparing these lost mirna families in e. granulosus, we found  <dig> are not detected in the parasitic platyhelminthes compared with s. mediterranea and  <dig> are absent from s. japonicum and e. granulosus. on further analysis of their evolutionary origin, we observed that most of the lost mirnas may be derived from some specific tissues, which have been reduced or lost in tapeworms. for example, there are  <dig> conserved mirna families expressed in the free-living s. mediterranea that are absent in the neodermata. among these, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have been found mainly present in locomotor ciliated cells, while mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are expressed in the gut
 <cit> . these organs have gradually disappeared in e. granulosus and some of the other parasitic platyhelminthes groups because of a significant decrease in locomotor and digestive activities associated with the parasitic mode of life. furthermore, in the neodermata, there is a significant degeneration of peripheral sensory nervous system elements, such as, the loss of eyes in tapeworms. in bilaterians, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have been reported to have a conserved affiliation with sensory organ differentiation
 <cit>  and mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> play essential roles in the development of eyes
 <cit> . these sensory tissue-specific mirnas are not detected in s. japonicum  and e. granulosus . thus, it seems that the loss of mirna loci in e. granulosus may be related to the reduction or loss of some specific tissues in the cestoda.

additionally, the biological evolution of one species to another is usually accompanied by the acquisition of new mirna families in the newly evolved species
 <cit> . although previous studies did not report there was any mirna family acquired in the platyhelminthes
 <cit> , we observed that mir- <dig> was present in e. granulosus, s. mansoni and s. japonicum. this result may be due to the lack of information in other taxa or due to evolutionary innovations to adapt to the new living environment. for tapeworms, in order to escape from host immune attack, e. granulosus produces many components to moderate the host immune response, such as egagb , which interferes with human dendritic cell differentiation and maturation
 <cit> . further, one recent study has shown that three schistosome-specific mirnas, bantam, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were detected in the plasma of s. japonicum-infected rabbits
 <cit> . these results imply that the gain of mir- <dig> in e. granulosus or s. japonicum may have resulted as an evolved adaptation in the parasitic platyhelminthes to moderate the host immune response. it is important to note that there are no reports to date on the plasma levels of e. granulosus mirnas in patients with ce. however, some dicrocoelium-specific mirnas have recently been shown to be present in exosome-like vesicles
 <cit>  and similar secretory vesicles have been described previously in the early stages of e. granulosus development
 <cit> .

notably, two novel close mirna clusters  were identified in e. granulosus and e. multilocularis. beside the same genomic location, they display similar patterns of mirna expression, suggesting that the expression of these novel mirnas may be co-regulated by the same promoter elements. furthermore, two clusters of mirnas share the ‘ggcgcuu’ motif with the known sme-mir- <dig>  recently, it has been reported that sme-mir- <dig> is enriched in planarian stem cells and is down-regulated in individuals in which stem cells had been abrogated by irradiation
 <cit> . these observations imply that these two clusters of mirnas may be associated in e. granulosus with cell proliferation and differentiation. moreover, since new-7/12/15/22/24/ <dig> of e. granulosus contains six copies of the same seed sequences in the 5′ hairpin arms, these multiple copies may likely be functional, resulting in the dose-dependent regulation of their downstream targets
 <cit> . similar multiple copies of mir- <dig> have been identified in s. mediterranea
 <cit> .

development in e. granulosus involves a number of different life stages including the eggs, activated oncospheres, hydatid cyst, psc and adult worms. it is a complicated and dynamic process and may be associated with mirna regulation. by comparing the differential expression pattern of mirnas, our results showed that let- <dig> exhibited  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold increased expression in psc and in the cyst, respectively, compared with the adult. let- <dig> has been shown to regulate developmental timing in c.elegans through the direct target genes lin- <dig> and hbl-1
 <cit> . thus, the observation of substantially increased expression of let- <dig> in the psc and cyst might be associated with the capability of e. granulosus for bi-directional development, differentiating into an adult worm in the definitive host dog gastrointestinal tract or into a secondary hydatid cyst in the intermediate  host
 <cit> .

indeed, bi-directional development is a unique biological characteristic of e. granulosus and our previous study showed that some protein-coding genes, with high homology to the bile acid receptors and transporters, were located in the e. granulosus genome, and that nuclear hormone receptors, including the farnesoid x receptor  and vdr, may play a key role in stimulating the psc to develop into adult worms
 <cit> . recently, the hormone receptors have been reported to directly activate transcription of the evolutionarily conserved let- <dig> and control the development of larvae to adults in c. elegans
 <cit> . here, we observed a positive correlation between the expression of let- <dig> and vdr, suggesting that vdr may induce crucial mirna transcriptional events and promote adult development in e. granulosus. furthermore, through mirna target prediction analysis, we found let- <dig> could complementary bind to the vdr 3′ utr sequences, suggesting that let- <dig> may mediate a negative feedback loop controlling the bile acid signal pathway in the development of psc. recently, a feedback circuit between let-7-family mirnas and daf- <dig>  a homolog of vertebrate fxr and vdr, has been found in c. elegans
 <cit> 
. additional experimental validations are required to explore this relationship in e. granulosus in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study describes the first large scale identification and dynamic characterisation of mirnas in three developmental stages of e. granulosus. a total of  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> mirna stars were identified. evolutionary conservation analysis suggested that the losses of mirna families in e. granulosus may be associated with morphological reductions. additionally, go analysis revealed that the differentially expressed mirnas and their targets may be involved in diverse development processes, including bi-directional differentiation and nervous system development. understanding the regulatory processes involving mirnas in e. granulosus may be helpful to explore the mechanism of interaction between this parasitic worm and its definitive and intermediate hosts, and provide new information to develop new interventions and therapeutics for the control of ce.
