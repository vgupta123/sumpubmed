BACKGROUND
phenotypic robustness refers to the invariance of the specified target phenotype given the genetic makeup and environmental conditions. whereas the presence of naturally occurring phenotypic variation is at the core of evolutionary biology, developmental geneticists have traditionally considered it as a nuisance. instead, they have relied on the study of single or multiple mutant combinations to reveal the generation of phenotypic patterns . a resurgence of interest in the issue of phenotypic robustness has emerged in recent years, partly due to experimental results showing that many knock-out mutations have little effect on phenotype , and that developmental systems show a high degree of stability with respect to perturbations  <cit> .

three major processes are involved in the control of phenotypic variability : canalization, developmental stability , and plasticity  <cit> . as first defined by waddington  <cit>  the term canalization could be understood as a morphogenetic constrain  <cit> , where development appears to be buffered so that slight abnormalities of genotype or slight perturbations in the environment do not lead to the production of abnormal phenotypes. however, evolutionary geneticists define canalization as the tendency of traits to evolve a reduction in variability  <cit> . ds can be defined as the ability of organisms to buffer against the random noise that arises spontaneously as a consequence of stochastic variation in the cellular processes that are involved in the development of morphological structures  <cit> . therefore, canalization and ds are subcategories of developmental buffering: the first can be appraised by estimating interindividual variance whereas the most commonly used estimate of ds in bilaterally symmetrical organisms is fluctuating asymmetry ; i.e. the intraindividual variation due to random differences between left and right sides. the question of whether or not canalization and ds are different buffering mechanisms has been a constant source of debate. two recent reviews implicitly  <cit>  or explicitly  <cit>  assume that ds is a special case of canalization, a viewpoint also embraced by several authors . thus, by using geometric morphometrics klingenberg and mcintyre  <cit>  found that the vectors describing inter- and intraindividual variation of landmark position for fly vein traits were highly concordant. on the other hand, debat et al.  <cit>  came to the opposite conclusion applying the same methods to cranial landmarks in the house mouse – although klingenberg's et al.  <cit>  work with mouse mandibles found patterns of intra- and interindividual variation that were only partly consistent –. at first glance, the different results may suggest that the mechanisms that affect canalization and ds are related in some developmental contexts but not in others. the problem is, however, that according to the causes of phenotypic variation a distinction between genetic and environmental canalization is necessary  <cit> . selection for environmental canalization may produce genetic canalization as a by-product  <cit> , but this may not always be the case.

the better way to address these contentious issues is to rely on quantitative genetic analyses devised to partition phenotypic variation into genetic and environmental components  <cit> . environmental variation can be further partitioned into general () and special  environmental effects (): the first refer to influential factors  that are shared by groups of individuals, whereas the latter are residual deviations from the phenotype that would be specified on the basis of genotype and general environmental effects. such deviations are unique to individuals and are largely unpredictable. the variance associated with special environmental effects can be estimated when experiments are performed on completely inbred lines . in bilaterally symmetrical organisms it is also feasible to estimate the two sources that contribute to those special environmental effects: among-individual () and within-individual variance (). if the only real cause of asymmetry is variation due to stochasticity in development, then fa can be taken as an estimated of . therefore, fa is only one source of the phenotypic variation within environments , contrarily to the arguments in nijhout and davidovitz  <cit> . the other source is .

the third process involved in the control of phenotypic variability is plasticity, which can be defined as the ability of an individual to express one phenotype under one set of environmental circumstances and another phenotype under another set. the expressed phenotypes can be discontinuous thus eliciting discrete morphs , or there can be a continuous range of potential phenotypes . the reaction norm is thus a property of the genome: genetic canalization and phenotypic plasticity are not mutually exclusive and can combine to form canalized reaction norms  <cit> . plasticity is thus an alternative to genetic change allowing populations to adapt to changing environmental conditions. to summarize, phenotypic plasticity increases the variance among groups of individuals that produce different phenotypes in different environments, canalization decreases the within-group interindividual variance around the target phenotype by reducing the sensitivity to genetic and environmental conditions, and ds buffers against random perturbations in development . because the left and right body sides share the same genome  and in most organisms also very nearly the same environment, fa provides an intrinsic control for genetic and environmental effects and the important question is to what extent these two sources of variation share underlying regulatory mechanisms.

within the framework of recently developed geometrically based methods for the statistical analysis of size and shape variation , the wing vein network of drosophila is regarded as an excellent model system to investigate those problems  <cit> . wing development in drosophila is well understood  <cit> , and the vein pattern is highly conserved across species . when flies are reared at low temperatures it is well known that the final wing size increases because of an increase in adult cell size  <cit> . this plastic response is parallel to what has been commonly observed in laboratory experiments on thermal evolution, where adaptation to lower temperature resulted in increased wing size  entirely as a consequence of cell size divergence  <cit> . however, there is circumstantial evidence suggesting that developmental and evolutionary temperature-related cell size divergence have contrasting effects on wing shape. thus, birdsall et al.  <cit>  concluded that wing shape in drosophila melanogaster is quite resistant to developmental temperature. conversely, in d. subobscura there are changes in wing proportions along a latitudinal size cline mediated by cell area  <cit> . these populations exhibit, in addition, prominent latitudinal clines for chromosomal inversion polymorphisms, and there is compelling evidence showing that the inversion clines underlie the latitudinal changes in wing proportions  <cit> .

here we report on the effects of clinal genetic variation  on wing form  and bilateral asymmetry using isochromosomal lines of d. subobscura. we consider the consequences of inbreeding and temperature on the two components of developmental homeostasis , and the relationship between them. the remainder of the paper is planned as follows. first, we provide a short account of the inversion polymorphism in d. subobscura and the experimental settings. then, based on the well balanced data set rendered by the experimental design we used the standard least-squares  method to decompose sources of variation for wing size and shape into causal components at the core of further analyses. furthermore, because the underlying assumption to use fa as a measure of ds is that left – right-side variation has not heritable basis, the genetic and environmental components of bilateral asymmetry were partitioned. as a result, our approach is unusual in studies of ds in providing estimates of the two components of special environmental effects  variance under different genetic backgrounds and general environmental settings. we also present some evidence for the presence of genetic variation in directional asymmetry  but not in fa. next, we test whether or not the vectors describing variation of landmark position for fly vein traits are concordant, and finally we discuss the main findings in relation with the evolution of buffering mechanisms and the putative adaptive value of natural wing shape variation in d subobscura.

experimental settings
d. subobscura is a particularly inversion-rich species, with up to  <dig> natural chromosomal arrangements already reported for the largest chromosome o  for which a balancer stock is available. in colonizing populations of the new world only six gene arrangements are segregating for that chromosome: ost, o3+ <dig>  o3+4+ <dig>  o3+4+ <dig>  o3+4+ <dig> and o <dig> . in native palearctic populations arrangements o3+4+ <dig> and o3+4+ <dig> are restricted to the mediterranean region  and are not involved in latitudinal clines  <cit> . on the other hand, arrangement ost shows a world-wide positive correlation with latitude, while arrangements o3+ <dig> and o3+4+ <dig> show a contrasting pattern  <cit> . therefore, six independent isochromosomal lines for each of these three chromosome arrangements  were used in the present experiments.

the experimental flies were obtained from  <dig> crosses, which will be referred to as inbred  with  <dig> crosses in total, or outbred  with  <dig>  crosses in total. the six lines with a given gene arrangement were crossed to produce the three different outbred homokaryotypes . the three kinds of heterokaryotypic flies were similarly obtained but using lines with different gene arrangements . since all isochromosomal lines were homogeneous for the same genetic background , maternal effects were not considered to be critically important. anyhow, experimental flies were randomly derived form reciprocal crosses for all outbred combinations. two developmental temperatures were used in the experiment: optimal  and warm .

RESULTS
variation and asymmetry in size
a) basic statistics
signed left-right () differences of centroid size did not significantly departure from normality in any case . in addition, none of the regressions of centroid size fa on average wing size was statistically significant  for inbred females at 18°c to β =  <dig>   for inbred females at 23°c), thus suggesting independence between size and size fa.

b) causal components of variation
for each sex two-way mixed anovas were separately performed for inbred and outbred crosses at each experimental temperature . size variation  among individuals comprised the largest part  of the variation. the fraction of the total phenotypic variance in wing size associated to genetic differences among karyotypes and/or lines  ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . 

average cs for left  and right  wings: inbred females  =  <dig>  mm,  =  <dig>  ; outbred females  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig> .

n.s. p >  <dig> ; ¶  <dig>  >p >  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig> .

average cs for left  and right  wings: inbred males  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig> ; outbred males  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig> .

n.s. p >  <dig> ; ¶  <dig>  >p >  <dig> ; * p <  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig> .

average cs for left  and right  wings: inbred females  =  <dig>  mm,  =  <dig> ; outbred females  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig> .

n.s. p >  <dig> ; * p <  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig> .

average cs for left  and right  wings: inbred males  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig>  ; outbred males  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig> .

n.s. p >  <dig> ; ** p <  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig> .

no significant size differences were generally detected among karyotypes for average cs, although o3+ <dig> flies were always the biggest within inbred lines . on the other hand, in outbred crosses heterokaryotypes were bigger than homokaryotypes  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; 23°c f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; males: 18°c f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; 23°c f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), but interactions of dominance effects were observed in all samples with discernible heterosis in ost/o3+ <dig> lines when compared to their homokaryotypic counterparts.

in concert with some independent preliminary results using a set of ost isochromosomal lines  <cit>  a quite remarkable finding here was that left wings were consistently bigger than the right ones, thus causing a generally highly significant da  of overall wing size even though da was fairly subtle . each drosophila wing vein has dorsal and ventral components that come together after the apposition of the dorsal and ventral surfaces, but each vein protrudes only in one wing surface   <cit> . when wings were mounted no attempt was made to standardize the surface position: in females  <dig>  left and  <dig>  right wings were mounted on the slides with the dorsal side up ; in males the corresponding figures were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . potential biasing effects when measuring wings; namely, dorsal or ventral bitmap images or possible differences between left and right wings when bitmap images are captured from the top or bottom of the microscope slide, were checked from a subset of  <dig> females and  <dig> males. an additional set of two images for each wing were taken in the same session from the top and bottom of the slide and digitized once. the centroid size differences between the averages of both measurements was apparently random with respect to digitizing procedure and always lower than  <dig> %, whereas left wings were  <dig> % bigger than the right ones in females and  <dig> % in males. we are, therefore, quite confident that the fairly subtle da for wing cs is not an experimental artifact but a real phenomenon.

in addition to da, there was subtle but significant fa in all crosses  together with a small amount of genetic variation for da in some of them. this last finding could hardly be attributable to a type i error because similar results had been previously obtained . conversely, two-level nested anovas to test for genetic components of overall size fa  failed to show any statistically significant effects whatsoever .

c) consanguinity and temperature effects
inbreeding and environmental effects were simultaneously analyzed by contrasting isogenic vs. outbred homokaryotypic flies reared at both experimental temperatures . flies were obviously bigger when raised at the lowest temperature, and three-way factorial anovas performed separately for each sex using cs , but results were qualitatively identical without a log-transformation) as the dependent variable, with karyotype, temperature and inbreeding as fixed effects, and crosses nested within karyotypes, clearly indicated inbreeding depression together with temperature by inbreeding interaction , but no karyotype by temperature interaction was detected. these results confirm that wing size is not a purely additive trait in d. subobscura, in agreement with the previous observation that heterokaryotypes were bigger than homokaryotypes in outbred crosses .

both inbreeding and  temperature effects were also apparent in females when overall size fa  was used as the dependent variable in three-way factorial anovas, with no differences among karyotypes. on the other hand, no statistically significant effects were detected for males, basically because inbred crosses performed approximately equal at both temperatures . however, overall asymmetry augmented in inbred crosses because da largely increased  at the highest temperature  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

it is worth mentioning here that in outbred crosses overall size fa was about the same for homokaryotypes and heterokaryotypes: the only significant effect was again an increase in fa at the sub-optimal temperature  values in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  4). finally, inbreeding appears to have affected among-fly variation only in males as suggested by the consistently lower  estimates in outbred crosses within rearing temperature.

in conclusion, overall size ds was positively correlated with levels of heterozygosity  and development at the optimal temperature of 18°c. however, no positive association was found between ds and chromosomal heterozygosity in outbred crosses.

variation and asymmetry in shape
a) sources of variation
two-way manova analyses to quantify inter- and intra-individual variation in wing shape are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  for the present study of  <dig> landmarks, with  <dig> coordinates each, the shape dimension is  <dig>  sums of squares and cross-products  matrices are therefore not full-ranked, and we retained  <dig> pc  scores for outbred crosses and only  <dig> pc scores – which accounted for more than 98% of the total shape variance – for inbred crosses to be capable of testing for genetic components. the degrees of freedom in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  are simply the corresponding degrees of freedom in the anovas for centroid size  times the number of pc scores retained in each sample. likewise, the overall covariation in wing shape  was decomposed into causal components ; and the overall covariation in wing shape fa  was decomposed into causal components attributable to wing shape da .

similarly to what had been found for cs, differences between left and right wings were also highly significant , thus indicating that da was present for overall wing shape. this finding is contrary to our previous claim from a subset of ost isochromosomal lines, where da for some landmarks  but not for overall wing shape was detected  <cit> . after plotting the procrustes grand mean shapes of both wings it also became apparent here that the location of the anterior crossvein was indeed slightly more distal in the right wings. furthermore, the individuals × sides interaction effects were highly significant in all cases and, hence, wing shape fa greatly exceeded measurement error.

b) causal components of variation
as has been forcefully stressed  <cit>  shape is an inherently multidimensional concept and cannot be easily reduced to a scalar index without severe loss of information. therefore, for a quantitative genetic analysis of shape data a multivariate approach is required  <cit> . for overall wing shape, genetic differences among karyotypes were mostly detected for outbred crosses , and we have estimated the covariance matrices p = k + c + e as a simple multivariate extension of the two-level nested anovas, where p is the phenotypic covariance matrix and k, c, and e are, respectively, the covariance matrices for karyotypes, crosses within karyotypes, and the residuals.

fig.  <dig> shows the amount of variation associated with the different dimensions in shape space. much of the variation was concentrated in the first few pcs, but the k matrices showed the clearest trend to quickly decrease after the first pc. permutation tests indicated that matrix correlations  between k and c matrices were generally higher at 18°c  than at 23°c , but none of the mcs was statistically significant. on the other hand, vcv matrices were correlated across rearing temperatures . a close inspection to fig.  <dig> reveals an increase in the genetic components of overall wing shape at 23°c, which agrees with our preliminary findings  <cit> . thus, the ratio between the total variance of genetic  covariance matrix onto the total variance of the phenotypic covariance matrix was lower at 18°c in both sexes . a caveat: these ratios cannot be interpreted as estimates of shape heritability  <cit> .

manova results in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> also point to the presence of genetic variation for overall shape da, mainly at 18°c . as far as we are aware, these are the first experiments that found detectable genetic variation in da for wing traits. the uncovering of da  for fly wings is quite general when quantitative analyses of form are carried out using the powerful methods of geometric morphometrics to reveal even small morphological variation that otherwise would remain hidden with less effective techniques  <cit> . this has raised concerns against the conventional wisdom that left and right are not distinguished in drosophila development  <cit>  because it provides compelling evidence that da in fly wings may signal the presence of genetic variation in a phylogenetic conserved left-right developmental axis , as discussed by klingenberg et al.  <cit> . actually, modern treatises in developmental biology  distinguish the left-right axis besides the customary anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, and several asymmetrically expressed genes  have recently been discovered. in drosophila, ligoxygakis et al.  <cit>  were the first  who showed a developmental mechanism for the developmental asymmetry. it seems, therefore, that the detection of genetic variation for da in this genus appears to be basically a methodological problem, including statistical power and the environmental conditions where the experiments are performed. the mechanisms that constitute the genetic basis of morphological asymmetry in drosophila obviously require further study.

c) genetic components of wing shape fa
following  <cit>  a multivariate equivalent of fa <dig>  was defined by changing the signs of all coordinate differences  whenever the inner product  of a left-right difference vector with the vector of mean left-right difference was negative. for the univariate case  this procedure would render here the absolute () differences, but notice that for the multivariate case it is not equivalent to calculate the absolute () differences of all procrustes coordinates.

manova analyses of these "unsigned" shape asymmetries in outbred crosses did not detect any genetic variation for shape fa at 18°c or 23°c . however, the approach used to define the multivariate equivalent of fa <dig> might be influenced by the arbitrary choice of the plane  to subdivide the shape space into "positive" and "negative" halves . a modified procrustes shape distance for non-isotropic variation  has been recently developed by klingenberg and monteiro  <cit> , and can be used here as a scalar measure of the amount of shape asymmetry because fa is random in origin . when this scalar was used in our data set the same conclusion was obtained; namely, there was no detectable genetic variation for wing shape fa in any case .

d) consanguinity and temperature effects on wing shape
to investigate allometric and nonallometric temperature effects on overall wing shape we performed a multivariate analyses of covariance  of the procrustes coordinates  considering temperature and inbreeding  as the categorical predictors and cs ) as the covariate. temperature effects were only significant in males, but inbreeding and temperature × inbreeding interaction effects were highly significant in both sexes , which suggests a strong effect of the categorical predictors on the nonallometric component of shape. size effects were also found to be significant  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; males: wilks' λ =  <dig> , f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), but the allometric effect on shape remained relatively consistent at both temperatures in females  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) but not in males  =  <dig> , p < <dig> ). the association between size and temperature , measured by the variance inflaction factor , was found to be lower than the suggested guideline for serious collinearity , which indicates that the effects of temperature and size on wing shape could be effectively separated.

the conclusion is, therefore, that drosophila wing shape does not seem to be as resistant to environmental temperature as previously claimed from the analysis of  <dig> highly inbred d. melanogaster lines  <cit> .

inbreeding effects  on wing shape fa were tested from the ratio between the traces of the corresponding "individual × side" vcv matrices. notice that the traces of these interaction matrices are equal to the respective mean squares of the procrustes anova as implemented by klingenberg and mcintyre  <cit> , and are simply the sum of   for each x and y coordinates of the corresponding aligned configurations divided by the shape dimension. we performed  <dig>  randomization runs for each test. inbreeding effects were detected at 18°c but only in females .

patterns of wing shape variation
a) fluctuating asymmetry
principal component analyses were only implemented for the outbred crosses since they are more representative of the natural situation. the percentages of total shape variation, together with the features of variation associated with the dominant pcs, are graphically plotted in figs.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  for the individual variation several pcs accounted for relatively large amounts of variability. on the contrary, for fa and measurement error pc <dig> explained almost all total variance . for all levels in the analysis  the dominant pcs were connected to the relatively large variability of landmarks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and, to a lesser extent, landmark  <dig>  however, the disproportionate amount of variation associated with these landmarks did not spread to all sources of causal variation because their coefficients were relatively small for the pc <dig> of karyotype variation . furthermore, for the individual variation the first two pcs were also linked to the shift of the anterior  and posterior  crossveins along the adjoining longitudinal veins.

permutation tests indicated that vcv matrices were mostly correlated for fa and measurement error effects within samples . the individual vcv matrix was significantly correlated with the fa and measurement error matrices only for females at 18°c. between temperatures the vcv matrices were highly correlated for fa and measurement error , but loosely correlated for the individual variation .

n.s. = p >  <dig> ; ** = p <  <dig> .

the angles between the pc1s for fa and measurement error were very much alike , which reflects the similarity due to landmarks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, the first three pcs for interindividual variation were generally distinct to those of fa: the only clear correspondences were between the pc1s for females at 18°c , and the pc <dig> of interindividual variation with the pc <dig> of fa for males at 18°c .  overall, these results seem to suggest that canalization and ds do not generally share the same underlying regulatory mechanisms .

a potentially important problem with the foregoing approach to compare the patterns of intra- and interindividual variation is to rely on the interaction vcv matrix as the source of variation due to fa. as has been previously argued the uncovering of da is almost ubiquitous for shape data when using the methods of geometry morphometrics, and there was evidence here for statistically significant genetic variation of overall shape da at 18°c . therefore, the vcv matrix from the "individuals × sides" interaction effect gives a biased estimate of developmental stability and cannot be taken as the covariance matrix for fa. in other words, this vcv matrix also includes all causal components due to genetic variation for da, and the corresponding unbiased vcv matrix for fa is that for the within-fly component of the interaction effect . in any case, all results were qualitatively similar and, hence, the conclusion that canalization and ds seem to be different mechanisms remains unchanged. however, it is difficult to appraise how this potential problem could have affected the previously published conclusions when comparing interindividual variation and "fa" in fly wings and mouse skulls .

between rearing temperatures the congruence of pc <dig> eigenvectors was also very high for fa  and measurement error . for the interindividual variation the correlations between pc1s were significant only in males ; however, the pc <dig> vector describing the joint interindividual variation of landmark position in females at 18°c matched the pc <dig> of the interindividual covariance matrix at 23°c  and vice versa .

b) causal components
besides the interindividual variation in the two-way manovas  it is important here to asses the patterns of joint displacements of landmarks for each of the causal components of wing shape variation . for karyotype variation pc <dig> accounted for ~60% of the total variance and was linked to a great extent with equivalent movements of those landmarks defining the location of the crossveins, which shifted in the same direction. landmarks  <dig> and  <dig> tended to move away each other, stretching the wing margin between longitudinal veins iii and iv. landmark  <dig> budged in the opposite direction to crossveins shifts, thus shaping the relationship between l <dig> to the total length of longitudinal vein iv .

a relative shortening of the basal length of longitudinal vein iv relative to the total wing length with an increasing dose of standard gene arrangements in all five major chromosomes of d. subobscura had been previously identified in an outbred stock  <cit> . a similar pattern regarding ost dose is also clear here when considering the six karyotypes , but rearing temperature quantitatively modified the shape index . however, there was no statistically significant karyotype × temperature interaction. the wing shape index appears to be a purely additive trait since heterokaryotypes were always intermediate to their corresponding homokaryotypes . actually, none of  <dig> within- group  possible contrasts comparing all three heterokaryotypes with the average of the corresponding homokaryotypes was statistically significant .

pc <dig> for karyotypes was also connected to the variability of landmarks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for the crosses component, several pcs explained relatively large amounts of variation, and shifts of crossveins now seem to be independent of each other at 18°c but not at 23°c. finally, for the within-fly variation several pcs accounted for relatively large amounts of variability. pc1s were again connected to the variability of landmarks  <dig>   <dig> and 7; and pc2s to shifts in the anterior crossvein.

the large amount of variation of the anterior and posterior crossveins for karyotypes and crosses can be interpreted in terms of developmental processes. the crossveins are determined after the longitudinal veins, and mutations that eliminate crossveins  do not affect the longitudinal veins; however, some mutants that affect the longitudinal veins also influence the crossveins . intra- and interespecific studies in several drosophila species have found displacements of one or both crossveins along their longitudinal veins, and such shifts also occur in a number of mutants . however, these shifts do not occur in isolation an also include other landmarks as well .

the matrix permutation tests  indicated that the vcv matrices of karyotypes and crosses were never significantly correlated with the vcv matrices of fa and measurement error. the high correlation between the vcv matrices of the interindividual and fa effects for females at 18°c was basically due to the  environmental component. also notice that all correlations between the vcv matrices of karyotype and fa effects were close to zero or even negative, which clearly suggests that this genetic component of canalization is unrelated to ds.

in addition, the pc1s of karyotypes and fa were nearly at right angles . the only matches were between pc <dig> of karyotypes and pc <dig> of fa for females at 18°c  and males at 23°c . the pc1s of crosses and fa were also poorly correlated; the only exception being females a 23°c . these results clearly support the hypothesis that genetic canalization and ds are not functionally the same mechanism.

on the other hand, all observed angles involving pc1s between "replicated genotypes"  and fa were relatively small and highly significant .  together with the overall comparisons of the covariance matrices , these results indicate that  environmental canalization and ds share underlying regulatory mechanisms but are not identical. there was not a complete congruence as pc <dig> of fa accounted for most part of the variation, while pc <dig> of between-fly variation usually explained less than 50% of the total variance .

to conclude, the theoretical lower limit for  environmental canalization  would be fa because the two sides share the same genome  and nearly the same environment, so differences between sides are likely to be small. under stabilizing selection this lower limit is obviously associated with higher fitness. however, this "canalization limit" would hardly ever be observed because of unavoidable additional sources of environmental variance . a similar logic than the one used in this work has been applied to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic stochastic variation in gene expression: intrinsic noise can be separated by contrasting the levels of gene expression in a construct with two identically regulated but fluorescently distinguishable gpf genes in the escherichia coli chromosome, whereas extrinsic noise is inferred by the correlated variation between the two copies in the same environment  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study applied the methods of geometric morphometrics in the context of quantitative genetics of wing form variation using isochromosomal lines of d. subobscura. the main findings can be summarized as follows:  for the analysis of overall size, ds was positively correlated with levels of heterozygosity  and development at the optimal temperature; however, no positive association was found between ds and chromosomal heterozygosity in outbred crosses;  there was detectable genetic variation  for the directional component of morphological asymmetry  but not for fa, which likely reflects variation due to stochasticity in development;  for analyses of shape, the patterns of covariation for fa and measurement error were highly concordant in all samples, which also provides strong reasons to conclude that fa is generated by random perturbations of developmental processes ;  the inter- and intraindividual variation patterns were generally poorly correlated, which supports the hypothesis that canalization and ds are distinct mechanisms; however,  the patterns of variation due to the  environmental component of canalization  were quite similar to those observed for fa;  the lack of a significant within-group correlation between the vcv matrices associated with the interindividual genetic components of canalization and fa, as well as the low similarity between the corresponding vectors describing variation of landmark position, strongly suggest that genetic and environmental canalization are not similar mechanisms.

in addition,  a discrepancy between sexes was observed in some situations; e.g. overall size fa increased with inbreeding and  temperature effects mainly in females, and the allometric effect on wing shape at both experimental temperatures was similar in females but not in males. it is also interesting to note here that wing size  clines for d. subobscura developed in north america after ~ <dig> years since colonization, but males were clearly lagging behind females  <cit> . what is not obvious, however, is why there is a difference between the sexes.

it has been suggested that a relationship between canalization and ds could only reflect a common underlying association between character and fitness  <cit> . those traits under strong stabilizing selection may not be genetically canalized and the major source of selective pressure for canalization can result from the benefits gained by buffering the effects of environmental perturbations  <cit> . the strongest evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes from the well-known genotype-phenotype mapping of rna folding. conservation of rna secondary structure is under strong selection, and low structural plasticity is achieved through increasing the thermodynamic independence of any one structural component from the remaining structure  <cit> . likewise, the flux summation theorem developed in the field of metabolic control analysis implies, if true, that phenotypic robustness is an inevitable outcome of the underlying metabolism and not a result of evolution .

however, it is still an open question whether or not natural wing shape changes in drosophila are adaptive. there are no consistent patterns between latitude and wing shape , contrarily to what happens for size-related traits where world-wide latitudinal clines are found with genetically larger individuals derived from higher latitudes . many genes with small additive effects on features of wing shape are dispersed along the drosophila genome , and we have shown here that the wing shape index l1/wl appears to be a purely additive trait since heterokaryotypes were always intermediate to their homokaryotypic counterparts. the wing shape cline in north america colonizing populations of d. subobscura  <cit>  can be largely accounted for parallel latitudinal clines in chromosomal gene arrangements  <cit> , and the small shifts of  the anterior and posterior crossveins in relation to karyotype variation  are difficult to link with any adaptive response to a better flight capacity. actually, we lack even hypothetical functional explanations for subtle shape variation: gilchrist et al.  <cit>  speculated that wing shape variation in d. subobscura may simply represent drift around an optimum. our present results  and  above) give some credence to that conjecture. genetic canalization on wing shape does not seem to arise as a by-product of environmental canalization and, therefore, canalization is not a single mechanism to buffer any source of variation as has been suggested  <cit> .

according to graham et al.  <cit>  the classical linear theory of ds can successfully account for both normally distributed error distributions and leptokurtic distributions caused by the admixture of individuals having different levels of ds, but cannot account for transitions between fa and da. we have previously suggested, however, that a transition from "ideal" fa  to a distribution showing da could be made entirely compatible with what it is already known from classical quantitative genetics  <cit> . shifts between asymmetry types  have been reported to happen along a species distribution range  <cit> , but unless the genetic component can be partitioned out the variation in left-right differences cannot be assumed to describe ds. from the results of outbred crosses reared at 18°c  it is possible to test here for the congruence between patterns of morphological variation with respect to the variation attributable to fa  and that attributable to genetic variation for da . the corresponding vcv matrices were highly correlated for females  =  <dig> ) but not for males  =  <dig> ). the angles between the pc1s also reflect this discrepancy between samples . when considered together, these results clearly suggest that fa and genetic variation for da may or may not be functionally linked.
