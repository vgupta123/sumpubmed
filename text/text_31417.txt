BACKGROUND
euglena gracilis is a free-living protist, distantly related to kinetoplastid protozoons  <cit> , and whose rna molecular biology displays a number of peculiar features. one example is the cytoplasmic ribosome of euglena and the genes encoding its constituent rrnas. typically in eukaryotes, hundreds to thousands of copies of the rrna operon are tandemly encoded on linear chromosomes. in euglena, a single copy of the rrna operon is carried on an 11-kbp extrachromosomal circular plasmid that is present in high copy number  and that replicates autonomously, with few if any integrated chromosomal rrna genes  <cit> . furthermore, a number of additional, novel internal transcribed spacer sequences in the euglena 28s rdna are excised during pre-rrna processing  <cit> . consequently, the mature lsu rrna, which typically consists of two stable species , is composed of  <dig> rrna pieces  in euglena  <cit> . a similar, but less extensive pre-rrna processing in trypanosomes yields a seven-fragment lsu rrna  <cit> . despite the extreme fragmentation of the euglena lsu rrna, the individual pieces are able to associate in trans  <cit>  to form functional ribosomes  <cit> . furthermore, ongoing mapping of o2'-methylribose and pseudouridine positions  suggests that the constituent lsu rrna is the most highly modified rrna of any organism examined to date  <cit> .

the small nucleolar rnas  constitute a very large family of small rnas present in the nucleolus as ribonucleoprotein complexes. most snornas guide the site-specific formation of o2'-methylribose or pseudouridine modifications in rrnas and snrnas  <cit> . some of the processing and cleavage events required for the liberation of mature rrnas from the pre-rrna transcript are mediated by a subset of snornas. one such processing snorna, the box c/d snorna u <dig>  was the first snorna identified  <cit>  and has since become the most extensively studied.

u <dig> snorna consists of 5'- and 3'-domains separated by a hinge region  <cit> . the 5'-domain contains sequence elements that are complementary to regions of the 5'-external transcribed spacer  of the pre-rrna, as well as to the 5'-end of the 18s rrna  <cit> . base-pairing interactions between the pre-rrna and its complementary regions in u <dig> snorna guide, by a complex and incompletely understood mechanism that includes the participation of u <dig>  <cit>  and u17/snr <dig>  <cit>  snornas, the multiple sequence-specific pre-rrna cleavage events that eventually liberate the mature 5'-end of the 18s rrna  <cit> . additional base-pairing interactions occur between the central hinge region of u <dig> snorna and the 5'-ets of the pre-rrna  <cit> . these multiple base-pairing interactions may also confer on u <dig> snorna a chaperone-like activity in the co-transcriptional folding of the 18s rrna  <cit> . the 3'-domain of u <dig> snorna, important in protein binding and rna stability, contains box c/d sequence elements characteristic of this snorna family  <cit> .

u <dig> snorna associates with at least  <dig> proteins  and  <dig> others) to form a large ribonucleoprotein complex termed the ssu processome  <cit> . in 'miller chromatin spreads' of actively transcribed rrna genes visualized by electron microscopy, this massive 80s complex of ~ <dig>  mda corresponds to the terminal knobs observed on the 5'-ends of growing pre-rrna 'christmas trees'  <cit> .

information about the many players, such as u <dig> snorna and its protein components, and the multiple, intricate and highly coordinated events in rrna processing and ribosome biogenesis, has accumulated largely from studies in the phylogenetically narrow grouping of animals and yeasts. therefore, our current understanding of ribosome biogenesis may not be truly representative of the many potentially different strategies used by phylogenetically disparate organisms. for this reason, the idiosyncratic features of rna biology in e. gracilis coupled with its key phylogenetic placement make this organism a potentially informative alternative model system for the study of rrna maturation, ribosome biogenesis and the many rna and protein components that participate in this highly complex process.

euglena u <dig> snorna  <cit>  is a 180-nt species exhibiting the sequence motifs typical of u <dig> snornas  <cit> . while considerably smaller than its homologues in yeast and vertebrates , euglena u <dig> snorna is comparable in size to its trypanosomatid relatives . unexpectedly, whereas u <dig> snorna is encoded by a single-copy gene in all examined trypanosome species  <cit> , heterogeneities observed in rna sequencing along with multiple hybridizing bands in southern analysis  <cit>  strongly suggested that u <dig> snorna is a multi-copy gene in the euglena genome. in trypanosomatids, the genomic neighborhood of the u <dig> snorna locus is particularly rich in genes for other small rnas, such as trnas and snrnas  <cit> . furthermore, in these organisms, the expression of the u <dig> snorna gene is dependent upon the presence of a closely linked, upstream and divergently oriented trna gene  <cit> . thus, we reasoned that an exploration of the genomic contexts of the euglena u <dig> snorna gene loci would uncover both commonalities and differences with respect to the trypanosomatid scenario. in addition, insights might be gained both into the evolution of u <dig> snorna and the functional architecture of the euglena genome.

here, we describe the results of a comprehensive analysis of e. gracilis u <dig> snorna genes and their genomic contexts. we confirm that unlike the trypanosomatid case, where u <dig> snorna is a single-copy gene, the euglena u <dig> snorna is encoded by a multigene family comprising at least  <dig> members. as in trypanosomes, most euglena u <dig> snorna genes are located near genes for other small rnas, such as trnas and u <dig> snrna. however, notable differences between the euglena and the trypanosomatid arrangements are evident, the evolutionary and functional implications of which are considered here.

RESULTS
multiple southern hybridizing bands imply that the gene encoding u <dig> snorna is multi-copy in the euglena genome
a complex and reproducible pattern of multiple hybridizing bands is produced in southern hybridization experiments with a euglena u <dig> snorna gene probe , implying that this gene is present in multiple copies in the euglena genome. the resulting hybridization patterns show at least  <dig> hybridizing ecor <dig>  bamh <dig> or ecor1/bamh <dig> fragments, ranging in size from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  kbp.

unexpectedly, the multiple u3-hybridizing fragments showed reproducible differences in signal intensity , with this apparent non-stoichiometry being confirmed by densitometric analysis. comparison within each sample lane revealed a number of bands with very similar signal intensities, including the  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -kbp bands . bands at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kbp also displayed very similar signal intensities . on the other hand, differences in relative signal intensity within a sample lane are clearly illustrated by comparison of the  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -kbp bands, whose signal intensities were  <dig> ×,  <dig> ×, and  <dig> × that of the  <dig> -kbp band . similar results have been obtained with other hybridization probes . the reproducibility of these results suggests that they are not attributable to incomplete restriction endonuclease digestion of the dna or to uneven transfer of restriction fragments from gel to membrane prior to hybridization.

three different u <dig> snorna gene arrangements identified in a λ library of euglena genomic dna
to investigate further the genomic organization of euglena u <dig> snorna, we screened a λ library of euglena genomic dna using a euglena u <dig> snorna gene probe, retrieving several u3-hybridizing λ clones. sequence walking in conjunction with blastn analysis revealed four unique u <dig> snorna gene variants in three different genomic contexts : i) a stand-alone gene, ii) linkage to trna genes, and iii) linkage to a u <dig> snrna gene.

a solitary u <dig> snorna gene arrangement was identified in a large 12-kbp genomic fragment . no additional, recognizable genes or sequence elements were found by blastn analysis.

a u3-hybridizing λ clone was found to encode a u <dig> snorna gene neighbored downstream by two identical arginine trna genes, both encoded in the opposite transcriptional orientation relative to the u <dig> snorna gene . the coding regions of the u <dig> snorna gene and first trnaarg gene are separated by  <dig> bp, whereas the two trnaarg genes are  <dig> bp apart. no additional genes were found by blastn analysis. this clone contains many short simple-sequence elements, also identified in other λ clones, such as homopolymer and dinucleotide repeats. in addition, unusual repetitive sequence elements are present, such as repeat sequences that are also present within the introns of the euglena γ-tubulin gene paralogs  <cit> . the region upstream of the u <dig> snorna gene also contains a euglena microsatellite sequence, egms <dig>  <cit> . finally, a 52-nt region, consisting of the 3'-end and putative transcription termination sequence of this particular u <dig> snorna gene variant, has evidently been duplicated. the resulting sequence consists of a full-length u <dig> snorna gene and transcription termination signal followed by the 3'-terminal 22-nt of the u <dig> snorna gene  and a nearly identical copy of the transcription termination signal.

the identified trnaarg gene is unremarkable in sequence and secondary structure . it adopts a conventional clover-leaf secondary structure, displays the expected d and tΨc loops, and possesses a small loop in the variable region.

two different u3-hybridizing λ clones were identified in which the u <dig> snorna gene is neighbored downstream by a convergently oriented u <dig> snrna gene . no additional genes were detected. while the u <dig> snorna and u <dig> snrna sequences in the two clones are highly similar, the size  and sequence of the u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna intergenic spacers are very different . furthermore, the sequence of the regions downstream of the u <dig> snrna genes is equally dissimilar. as with the other λ clones, the two u3-u <dig> genomic inserts contain many short repetitive sequence elements and stretches of extreme nucleotide bias .

as with most protist u snrnas, the euglena u <dig> snrna gene sequence was previously unknown. its nucleotide sequence and secondary structure  display features present in u <dig> snrnas from other organisms. the euglena u <dig> snrna is  <dig> nt in length, the position of its 5'-end inferred by comparison with other u <dig> snrna sequences. the precise 3'-end was determined by 3' race analysis and by chemical sequencing of the rna . the secondary structure consists, in its 5'-region, of a stem-loop region punctuated by a central bulge. the 11-nt terminal loop i contains the invariant 9-nt sequence  known to interact with exon sequences at the 5'- and 3'-splice sites  <cit> . the 3'-region contains a conventional sm binding site. notably, a small stem-loop structure, typically present near the 3'-end of u <dig> snrnas, is not found in the euglena u <dig> snrna.

southern analysis suggests that euglena u <dig> snorna genes are frequently linked to u <dig> snrna genes
although intensive screening of the euglena λ genomic library identified only four different u <dig> snorna genes in three distinct genomic contexts, southern analysis of euglena genomic dna revealed at least  <dig> u3-hybridizing bands. because we could not account for many u <dig> snorna genes , southern analysis was performed to determine whether additional variants of the linkages identified in the λ genomic fragments are present in the euglena genome.

southern analysis of euglena genomic dna using a trnaarg gene probe identified multiple hybridizing bands , suggesting that the trnaarg gene is also multi-copy in the euglena genome. this result was not unexpected, considering that trna genes frequently constitute large, multigene families.

a single band, co-hybridizing with the u <dig> and trnaarg probes , is suggestive of a single u3-trnaarg gene linkage in the euglena genome. other members of the trnaarg gene family do not appear to be similarly linked to u <dig> snorna genes.

the authenticity of the apparent u3-trnaarg co-hybridization was further substantiated by the observation that a probe derived from the region upstream of the u <dig> gene in the u3-trnaarg λ clone  predominantly labeled the band that hybridized with both the u <dig> and trnaarg probes . this probe also contains the euglena microsatellite sequence  <cit>  mentioned above, which likely explains the relatively high level of background hybridization seen in this particular case.

southern analysis of euglena genomic dna with a u <dig> gene probe identified ~ <dig> hybridizing fragments, ranging in size from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig> kbp. . thus, u <dig> snrna is also encoded by multiple genes in the euglena genome.

comparison of the u <dig> southern hybridization result with the u <dig> one revealed at least eight co-migrating hybridization bands . thus, the majority of u <dig> snrna genes, though not all, appeared to be linked to u <dig> snorna genes in the euglena genome.

in addition, as observed with the u3-hybridizing bands, the u5-hybridizing bands also showed reproducible differences in hybridization intensity. furthermore, the relative signal intensities within the u <dig> pattern co-vary with those within the u <dig> pattern.

genomic pcr confirms multiple u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages in the euglena genome
to examine putative u3-u <dig> gene linkages in detail, we used a genomic pcr strategy to amplify, clone and sequence u3-u <dig> intergenic spacers  as well as the flanking u <dig> and u <dig> genes. as expected from the sequence of the two u3-u <dig> λ clones and from the results of southern analysis, multiple pcr products were obtained . to ensure complete coverage of all u3-u <dig> linkages, a total of  <dig> clones, from five different pcr-generated libraries, were sequenced and analyzed, with multiple clones of each linkage being identified. thus, nucleotide heterogeneities between the different u3-u <dig> linkages are considered legitimate and not attributable to taq-induced errors or to pcr-mediated recombination  <cit> .

the cloned u3-u <dig> pcr products ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. detailed sequence analysis identified a total of  <dig> unique u3-u <dig> linkages. comparison of the unique sequences revealed that the multiple u <dig> snorna sequences are highly similar, as are the multiple u <dig> snrna sequences, the members of each group displaying only limited sequence heterogeneities . however, substantial variability is seen in the size and sequence of the igs separating the u <dig> and u <dig> genes. despite this variability, regions of sequence similarity within the igs suggest that the gene linkages may be related . thus, the  <dig> unique u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages appear to form five families that can be further divided into sub-families .

u3-u <dig> family a, representing the linkage having the longest igs sequence, comprises four members. based on sequence similarity, the members of this family can be divided into two sub-families, a <dig> and a <dig>  with the a <dig> subfamily being further divided into a1a, a1b and a1c. members of the a family show the highest level of identity, exhibiting only minor nucleotide changes and a 17-nt indel in the igs sequence. the a1a pcr linkage  corresponds to the u3-u <dig> linkage identified in the λ genomic clone c <dig> .

the b-linkage family contains two members, b <dig> and b <dig>  the igs sequences of the two linkages show the lowest level of sequence identity of any of the linkage families. the relatedness of the members of the b-linkage family is based on the presence of short regions of sequence identity, which are punctuated by regions of nucleotide divergence. short regions of apparent sequence similarity at both ends of the igss, immediately downstream of the 3'-ends of the u <dig> and u <dig> genes, may correspond to transcription termination signals, in which case these regions do not actually contribute to linkage family relatedness. the b <dig> pcr linkage  corresponds to the u3-u <dig> linkage identified in the λ genomic clone c <dig> .

the c-, d-, and e-linkage families each contain two members, c <dig> and c <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  and e <dig> and e <dig>  each linkage family exhibits regions of sequence similarity interrupted by regions of nucleotide difference and by indels. overall, the level of sequence identity in the members of the c, d and e linkage families is intermediate between that of the highly similar a family and the very divergent b family. some of the u3-u <dig> linkages were confirmed by southern hybridization analysis .

a similar genomic pcr approach was used to search for other arrangements of linked u3-u <dig> genes, such as divergently  and similarly  oriented genes. the possible presence of tandem u <dig> snorna genes was also investigated. no linkages of these types were found.

a revised secondary structure model for euglena u <dig> snorna
the nucleotide heterogeneities identified in the u <dig> variants prompted a re-assessment of the likely secondary structure of euglena u <dig> snorna. a recent phylogenetic comparison of u <dig> sequences from representative taxa  <cit>  has uncovered additional conserved sequence elements and rna motifs that are also present in the euglena u <dig> snorna . an alignment of known u <dig> snorna sequences from representative organisms is shown in additional file  <dig>  furthermore, information from mutational studies  <cit>  and from in vivo chemical and enzymatic structure-probing experiments  <cit>  has resulted in significant revision of the proposed general secondary structure of u <dig> snorna. accordingly, a revised conserved sequence element and secondary structure model for euglena u <dig> snorna is presented here .

sequence elements in the 5' region of u <dig> are known to interact with the 5' external transcribed spacer  of the pre-rrna and with the 5' region of the 18s rrna. the first such element in u <dig> snorna is the gac box, followed by the a' box and then the a box  <cit> . in the identified euglena u <dig> genes, a single nucleotide heterogeneity has been mapped to this region. the heterogeneity, an a-to-g transition, is located downstream of the a box sequence.

the central hinge region of the euglena u <dig> snorna contains a small stem-loop structure consisting of a 3-bp stem with a 5-nt loop. as in other organisms  <cit> , potential base-pairing interactions may occur between the euglena u <dig> hinge domain  and the 5' external transcribed spacer  of the pre-rrna  <cit> . in the multiple euglena u <dig> genes, a sequence heterogeneity is located in the 3' hinge region. this a-to-c transversion is located immediately downstream of the small stem-loop structure.

the 3'-terminal domain of the euglena u <dig> snorna contains conserved sequence elements, boxes c', b, c and d, known to interact with rna-binding proteins  <cit> . this domain consists of an extended stem-loop structure punctuated by a number of bulge-loop elements. in our revised model, box c' and box d elements are juxtaposed in the secondary structure context, as are box b and box c elements. the box elements are mainly single-stranded, corresponding to small bulge-loop structures; however, some regions may form short base-pairing interactions. more importantly, alternative base-pairing interactions in the 3'-terminal domain allow for the formation of two kink-turn  rna motifs  <cit>  within the juxtaposed box c'/d and b/c elements.

nearly all of the sequence heterogeneities identified in the multiple euglena u <dig> snorna variants  are located in the 3'-extended stem-loop domain. ten of the  <dig> sequence heterogeneities are transitions, vs. two transversions. the majority of nucleotide heterogeneities in helical regions result in shifts from watson-crick base-pairings  to non-canonical interactions . three heterogeneities occur in single-stranded regions, none of which is part of a single-stranded conserved box element. two nucleotide heterogeneities, present in the same u <dig> snorna variant near the terminal stem-loop structure, form compensatory base changes  and thus maintain base-pairing interactions. two additional nucleotide heterogeneities map to the terminal base pairs of short stem regions, immediately adjacent to the opening or closing of bulge-loop structures. since neither of these heterogeneities maintains the terminal base-pairing interactions of the stems, a slight expansion of the adjacent bulge-loop structures results. one of the two heterogeneities is located within the box c' element, adjacent to the 5+ <dig> motif of the k-turn  <cit> . only one heterogeneity, located in a short stem region, disrupts a standard base-pairing interaction. in sum, the distribution of the  <dig> sequence heterogeneities identified in the 3'-extended stem-loop domain of euglena u <dig> snorna results in minimal changes to the overall secondary structure of the region.

discussion
in euglenozoa, u <dig> snorna genes are frequently linked to genes for other small rnas
in one of three patterns of u <dig> snorna gene organization identified here, a u <dig> snorna gene is linked to two identical, downstream and convergently oriented  trnaarg genes in the euglena genome . close linkage of u <dig> snorna and trna genes has been found in a number of trypanosomatids, members of the kinetoplastid protozoa, which are the closest relatives of the euglenids. the most dramatic example is in leishmania tarentolae, where a  <dig> -kbp genomic region encodes the u <dig> snorna gene along with genes for  <dig> trnas, u <dig> snrna and 5s rna   <cit> . sequence for a portion of the corresponding region in l. major  reveals the same gene content organized in the same manner. in both leishmania cases, the u <dig> snorna gene is neighbored by a single, downstream, convergently oriented trnaarg gene .

in trypanosoma brucei, the u <dig> snorna gene is neighbored upstream by a divergently oriented trnaarg gene ; no proximal genes are encoded downstream of the t. brucei u <dig> snorna gene   <cit> . in leptomonas collosoma, a divergently oriented trnalys gene is also encoded upstream of the u <dig> snorna gene  <cit>  . similarly, an upstream, divergently oriented trnalys gene neighbors the u <dig> snorna gene in both l. tarentolae and l. major, in addition to the downstream, convergently oriented trnaarg gene noted above. in all of these trypanosomatid cases, the igs separating the u <dig> and trna genes is  <dig> to  <dig> bp in size, compared to  <dig> bp in the euglena. in the phylogenetically unrelated ciliate tetrahymena thermophila, a u <dig> snorna gene is also neighbored by an upstream, identically oriented trnalys gene. however, in this case, the u3-trna igs is nearly  <dig> bp in size  <cit> . evidently, close physical linkage of u <dig> snorna and trna genes is a widespread phenomenon within the trypanosomatids, with similar linkages in euglena and in tetrahymena.

the most striking observation to emerge from the present study is the multiplicity of distinct u <dig> snorna genes and gene arrangements in the euglena genome, in stark contrast to what is seen in trypanosomatids  <cit> . in addition to the u3-trnaarg linkage, we document here  <dig> distinct examples of u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkage in the euglena genome. in all these examples, the u <dig> snrna gene is located downstream and in the opposite transcriptional orientation relative to the u <dig> snorna gene . to date, no linked u3-u <dig> genes have been identified in other organisms. furthermore, with the exception of trna genes, u <dig> snorna genes have not been found directly linked to other genes encoding small rnas.

genes specifying modification-guide box c/d and box h/aca snornas are frequently clustered, including in trypanosomatids  <cit>  and in euglena  <cit> . so far, however, u <dig> snorna genes have not been found linked to modification-guide snorna genes in any eukaryote, and this also appears to be the case in euglena.

influence of u <dig> snorna gene organization on u <dig> snorna gene expression
the expression of u <dig> snorna genes in trypanosomatids and other eukaryotes has been extensively studied. in all instances examined, trypanosomatid  <cit> , other protist  <cit>  and plant  <cit>  u <dig> snorna genes are transcribed by rna polymerase iii . based on the sister-group relationship between kinetoplastids and euglenids  <cit> , u <dig> snorna is similarly assumed to be synthesized by rnap iii in euglena, although this inference remains to be confirmed experimentally. in all cases, u <dig> snorna genes are transcribed from their own promoter and u <dig> transcripts do not appear to be part of larger, polycistronic transcripts.

in trypanosomatids, the expression of u <dig> snorna is dependent on the linked, upstream, divergently oriented trna gene. two extragenic regulatory elements  required for trypanosome u <dig> snorna gene expression  <cit>  correspond to the trna d and tΨc loops, which are known to serve generally as intragenic rnap iii promoter elements for trna genes. furthermore, the spacing of the a and b boxes relative to each other and to the u <dig> snorna gene is critical. as noted above, the distance between the upstream trna gene and the u <dig> snorna gene varies within a narrow range  in trypanosomatids . transcription factor tfiiic is known to bind to the b box element of the trna gene, whereupon it recruits transcription factor tfiiib, which in turn sequesters rnap iii for transcription initiation  <cit>  in yeast, transcription of trna genes by rnap iii prevents nucleosome assembly in the immediate vicinity of these genes, and concomitant nucleosome-mediated repression  <cit> . thus, the binding of tfiiic to the b box is postulated to play an indirect role, through chromatin remodeling, in the expression of trypanosomatid trna-linked u <dig> snorna genes  <cit> . whether the downstream trnaarg genes play a similar role in u <dig> snorna transcription in euglena remains to be determined. the euglena u <dig> snorna-trna genes are not as closely linked  as they are in trypanosomatids . however, the presence of two trnaarg genes in the euglena case might result in more efficient recruitment of tfiiic to this site and a parallel chromatin remodeling effect over a larger region. the fact remains that most u <dig> snorna genes in euglena are evidently not linked to trna genes, so any parallel with u <dig> snorna gene expression in trypanosomatids must necessarily be limited.

gene duplication in the generation of multiple u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages in euglena
the  <dig> different u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages described here cluster into five discrete families, based on sequence conservation within the igs . in the 'a' family, three linkage variants form a sub-family  while a fourth linkage is the sole member of the second sub-family . linkage families b, c, d, and e contain two u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages each. no regions of sequence conservation common to all  <dig> linkage variants are evident within the igs.

at this point, the origin and generation of the multiple u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages remains a matter of conjecture. it is not unreasonable to suppose that the current arrangement arose via duplication of one or a few ancestral u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages. the pathway of formation and fixation of the ancestral u3-u <dig> gene linkage is unclear, but the linkage per se presumably was generated by random gene shuffling and perhaps maintained by a favorable effect on gene expression. multiple rounds of locus, chromosome and/or genome duplication followed by sequence divergence likely then created the observed linkage families and sub-families.

in support of this proposal, accumulating evidence from sequence analysis indicates that parts of the euglena genome are highly repeated and that the genome may be evolutionarily plastic. an arrangement similar to the u3-u <dig> linkage case has been described for the euglena spliced leader rna  gene, which is linked to a 5s rrna gene  <cit> . as with the u <dig> snrna gene, some sl rna genes are dispersed throughout the genome; however, the majority are linked to an identically oriented 5s rrna gene. the linkage is encoded within a tandemly repeated  <dig> -kbp unit, and it is estimated that up to  <dig> sl rna-5s rrna gene linkages are present in the euglena genome. in the absence of large-scale linkage data, we do not know whether the u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages described here might be similarly present in the euglena genome as repeated arrays, although pcr amplification results would seem to rule out any closely linked u3-u <dig> units.

limited information on gene copy number for other euglena snrnas gives a contrasting picture. southern hybridization analysis of euglena dna with a euglena u <dig> snrna  <cit>  gene probe yields a single hybridizing band, a result substantiated by pcr amplification and the sequencing of several independent euglena u <dig> snrna clones, which revealed no nucleotide heterogeneities . in contrast, when 3' race-based pcr amplification was used to obtain the sequence of the euglena u <dig> snrna  <cit> , at least four sequence variants were obtained . additional evidence for the repetitive nature of portions of the euglena genome has come from studies of euglena modification-guide  snornas, where many cases of multi-copy, linked snorna genes have been found  <cit> . similarly, on-going bioinformatic screens of euglena cdnas have revealed multiple allelic variants of typically single-copy ribosomal protein genes . thus, it appears that many, though not all, genes are multi-copy in the genome of euglena.

are u <dig> snorna genes spatially organized in the nucleus?
a recent model for the spatial organization of rnap iii-transcribed genes in the nucleus may be relevant to the organization and expression of u <dig> snorna genes in euglena, trypanosomatids and some other organisms. this model stems from in situ hybridization studies suggesting that the  <dig> trna genes of yeast, although dispersed throughout the linear map of the genome, are localized to the nucleolus  <cit> . this situation is analogous to the three-dimensional co-localization of the multiple rdna genes in the nucleolus. accordingly, it has been proposed that chromosomal loci encoding trna genes also associate in three-dimensional space within the nucleus. such an arrangement could conceivably lead to the formation of a trna transcription and processing center enriched in rnap iii, transcription, and processing factors  <cit> . experimental evidence suggests that u <dig> snorna genes in human cells may associate in three-dimensional space with coiled bodies in the nucleus  <cit> . thus, the three-dimensional clustering of genes transcribed by rnap iii could promote the formation of 'transcription territories'  <cit>  that function to more efficiently recruit transcription complexes to the region, thereby maintaining a high level of gene expression. although it is not known whether this scenario applies to euglena u <dig> snorna genes, the suggestion is a plausible one considering that euglena u <dig> snorna genes are likely transcribed by rnap iii and for the most part are linked either to trna genes or to the rnap iii-transcribed u <dig> snrna gene.

why so many u <dig> snorna genes in the euglena genome?
the euglena genome encodes at least  <dig> different u <dig> snorna genes. while u <dig> snorna is an essential gene, it is unclear why the euglena genome would encode so many copies, considering that the u <dig> snorna gene is single-copy in trypanosomatid protozoa  <cit> . at least part of the explanation for this evident expansion of u <dig> snorna genes in euglena may have to do with the unusual features of its rrna genes and mature rrna species.

in a euglena cell, a single unit of linked rrna genes is encoded on each of ~1000- <dig> copies of an extrachromosomal plasmid-like dna species  <cit> , in contrast to the arrangement of chromosomally integrated tandem rdna arrays in most other eukaryotes. electron micrographs show an unusual, extensively segmented nucleolar structure in euglena, which might reflect the organization of the individual plasmid-like rdna elements into a number of distinct, higher order clusters within the nucleus.  if u <dig> snorna genes are also physically and functionally localized at or near the nucleolus, the additional numbers of u <dig> snorna genes seen in euglena may be required to accommodate an atypical nucleolar organization of its rdna genes, thereby more efficiently coordinating u <dig> snorna expression and function with rrna synthesis and processing.

another consideration is that, relative to the situation in a typical eukaryote, many additional spacer sequences are removed during pre-rrna processing in euglena, resulting in a naturally and highly fragmented 28s rrna equivalent  <cit> . one suggestion is that euglena u <dig> snorna might participate in these additional pre-rrna processing events  <cit> . alternatively, the additional processing steps might result in the production of a relatively higher proportion of defective ribosomes than in other eukaryotes, in which case a relatively larger number of pre-rrna transcripts would presumably need to be processed in order to maintain an adequate number of functional ribosomes in the cell. this requirement would in turn necessitate a greater number of u <dig> snorna molecules, a requirement that presumably could be achieved by encoding and expressing an expanded number of u <dig> snorna genes.

a problem with the above suggestions is that trypanosomatid lsu rrnas are also fragmented, although not as extensively as those in euglena  <cit> . nevertheless, as noted above, the u <dig> snorna gene is single copy in trypanosomatid genomes  <cit> . thus, it appears unlikely that the multi-copy nature of euglena u <dig> snorna genes could be a direct consequence of the particularities of rrna processing in euglena.

u <dig> snorna genes and the euglena genome
considering the long history of euglena gracilis as a 'laboratory workhorse', surprisingly little is known about its genome. the varying intensities of u <dig> snorna-hybridizing bands in southern blots of euglena dna suggests that the actual number of u <dig> snorna genes may be substantially higher than the  <dig> we have documented here. technical considerations in restriction endonuclease digestion, transfer of restriction fragments and subsequent hybridization have been eliminated as possible sources of artifact contributing to hybridization variability, based on the reproducibility of the results under different experimental conditions.

aneuploidy, in which a cell contains different numbers of one or more chromosomes, appears to be the most likely explanation for the varying intensities of hybridizing bands. in many organisms, aneuploidy is associated with genome instability, as in human trisomy- <dig>  and many cancers. however, aneuploidy has been postulated to occur normally in a number of protists  <cit>  and in fungi  <cit> , although in these cases it does not appear to result in genome instability.

aneuploidy has been reported in a number of trypanosomatids, including trypanosoma cruzi  <cit>  and leishmania  <cit> . in such cases, results similar to those presented here have been obtained. in pulsed field gel electrophoretic analysis of t. cruzi dna, the ethidium bromide staining intensities of different chromosomal bands varies within single samples. furthermore, dna-content variability of up to 70% has been observed in cells derived from a single clone. there is as yet no direct evidence for aneuploidy in euglena; however, the demonstrated occurrence of aneuploidy in trypanosomatids, in conjunction with the results presented here, makes aneuploidy a distinct possibility in euglena.

CONCLUSIONS
the comprehensive analysis reported here has revealed multiple u <dig> snorna genes in the protist euglena gracilis, in three distinct genomic arrangements: i) stand-alone, ii) linked to two tandem, identical trnaarg genes, and iii) linked to a u <dig> snrna gene. the multiple u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages, which cluster into distinct families based on sequence similarities within the intergenic spacer, presumably arose by genome, chromosome, and/or locus duplications. we suggest that the evident expansion of u <dig> snorna genes in euglena, compared to its kinetoplastid distant relatives, may have to do with the unusual features of euglena rrna genes and mature rrna species and/or a highly recombinogenic genome. in view of the variability in the signal intensities of the multiple bands consistently observed in our southern hybridization experiments, we further raise the possibility that euglena contains a naturally aneuploid chromosome complement.
