BACKGROUND
reduction in absolute β-cell mass and/or function is linked to type- <dig> and type- <dig> diabetes mellitus  <cit> . this decrease in β-cell mass is primarily due to apoptosis driven by an increase in cytokine levels and/or a nutrient overload  <cit> . in fact, nutrient overload as represented by elevated levels of saturated fatty acid and glucose increases cytokine production from β-cells, activates jnk and nfκb signaling pathways  <cit> , and triggers oxidative and er stresses  <cit> . these conditions  result in chronic low grade inflammation  <cit>  which play a central role in β-cell apoptosis  <cit> . hence, it becomes imperative to delineate impacts of this chronic low grade inflammation and to make efforts overcome underlying severe consequences.

the β-cell mass is positively regulated by multiple mechanisms  <cit>  and mild hyperglycemia itself can yield a compensatory increase in mass since glucose regulates β-cell growth  <cit> . insulin secreted from β-cells in response to glucose activates akt/pkb, a known inducer of cell growth and survival through the irs-pi3k pathway. similarly, igf, insulin receptor, irs <dig> and akt have been associated with β-cell growth  <cit> . thus, activation of insulin signaling by stimulating its secretion can positively impact β-cell survival and growth. for instance, glp <dig> treatment, which enhances insulin secretion, has a positive impact on β-cell mass  <cit> , and an increase in camp levels as mediated by glp <dig> has been shown to reduce inflammatory signaling and apoptosis in β-cells  <cit> .

the g-protein coupled receptor  <dig> , also known as free fatty acid receptor  <dig>  is highly expressed in pancreatic β-cells. it is involved in fatty acid mediated potentiation of insulin secretion. activation of gpr <dig> can increase insulin secretion  <cit>  through phopsholipase-c  -ca+ <dig> pathway only at stimulatory glucose concentration.

here, we propose that an increase in insulin secretion mediated by gpr <dig> can activate akt/pkb to positively impact β-cell survival. activation of gpr <dig> is also known to improve calcium flux in β-cells under chronic inflammatory conditions  <cit> . since calcium dynamics and camp levels are coupled  <cit> , we propose that gpr <dig> activation also attenuates inflammatory signaling.

in this study, we activated gpr <dig> using a specific small molecule agonist . pharmacological activation of gpr <dig> by cnx-011- <dig> was very specific as an increase in cytoplasmic calcium flux was seen only in cells expressing gpr <dig> and no calcium flux was observed in cells which did not express gpr <dig>  moreover, cnx-011- <dig> mediated calcium flux was mediated through plc pathway. treatment of nit <dig> cells and rat islets with cnx-011- <dig> showed a reduction in inflammatory signaling, inflammatory cytokines gene expression, cellular oxidative and er stresses while increasing insulin secretion, intracellular insulin content and pro-survival signaling pathways. taken together, gpr <dig> agonists provide a novel tool to counteract inflammation mediated β-cell dysfunction.

RESULTS
pharmacological activation of gpr <dig> enhances cytoplasmic calcium level in plc dependent manner
gpr <dig> activation by small molecule agonist  significantly increased cytoplasmic calcium level   <dig> afu of control) only in chok <dig> cells over-expressing mouse gpr <dig> compared to the control . the cytoplasmic flux induced by cnx-011- <dig> was plc-dependent as treatment with a plc inhibitor  abolished this flux . normal chok <dig> cells which did not express gpr <dig> showed no increase in cytoplasmic calcium in response to cnx-011- <dig> . this data demonstrates that cnx-011- <dig> specifically activates gpr <dig> 

activation of gpr <dig> attenuates cellular inflammation
under chronic inflammatory conditions, nit <dig> cells showed a  <dig>  fold increase in jnk phosphorylation  and 60% decrease in iκb levels  compare to untreated cells, indicative of increased nfκb signaling. activation of gpr <dig> decreased inflammation-induced jnk phosphorylation  and increased iκb levels  in nit <dig> cells .gene expression of both nf-κb  and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il1β , tnfα , and nos2a  was up-regulated by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold respectively under chronic inflammation in rat islets, consistent with increased jnk and nf-κb activation. gpr <dig> activation reduced expression levels of nf-κb and pro-inflammatory genes to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  fold  respectively. these results demonstrate that activation of gpr <dig> can negate inflammatory signaling in β-cells.

gpr <dig> activation reduces cellular stress in β-cells
since increased cellular stress is a major contributing factor for β-cell apoptosis, we investigated whether gpr <dig> activation influences cellular stress . under conditions mimicking chronic inflammation, nit <dig> cells showed  <dig>  fold increase of ros compared to control which was brought back to normal upon gpr <dig> activation . similarly, chronic inflammation induced chop  gene expression up to  <dig>  fold in rat islets which was brought back to  <dig>  fold upon gpr <dig> activation . like chop gene expression, inflammation conditions increased bip level  and eif2α  phosphorylation in nit <dig> cells  which were reversed upon gpr <dig> activation  . taken together, these data demonstrate that activation of gpr <dig> significantly lowers inflammatory signaling and cellular oxidative and er stress.

gpr <dig> activation protects β-cells from inflammation-induced apoptosis
to support the results from cellular oxidative and er stress, we next showed cellular apoptosis by different methods. treatment with chronic inflammation caused nuclear fragmentation in nit <dig> cells as measured by a significant increase in number of condensed nuclei . quantification data revealed that inflammation caused more than two fold increase in these condensed nuclei . gpr <dig> activation under this condition reduced nuclear fragmentation  as number of condensed nuclei was decreased . chronic inflammation enhanced cytochrome-c levels  with a concomitant increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling  positivity . similarly, caspase- <dig> activity was also increased under chronic inflammation . gpr <dig> activation significantly decreased these apoptotic effects of inflammation as cytochrome-c level , tunel positivity  and caspase- <dig> activity were reduced . the gpr40-mediated inhibition of caspase- <dig> activity was plc-dependent since treatment with plc inhibitor  attenuated the effect of cnx-011- <dig> . interestingly, plc inhibition increased caspase- <dig> activity more than chronic inflammation itself . thus, activation of gpr <dig> reduced inflammation-induced apoptosis of β-cells.

gpr <dig> activation reduces apoptosis through camkii, calcineurin and camp signaling
in order to decipher how gpr <dig> activation rescued β-cell apoptosis, we measured caspase- <dig> activity under chronic inflammation and used various pharmacological inhibitors to dissect out the underlying molecular mechanism. since an increase in cytoplasmic calcium level activates camkii and calcineurin, we inhibited their activity using aip and cyclosporine-a respectively  <cit>  and measured changes in gpr <dig> mediated caspase- <dig> activity. activation of gpr <dig> reduced inflammation-induced caspase- <dig> activity  and this reduction was abolished by the inhibition of either camkii  or calcineurin  . these data indicate an important role for gpr40-induced calcium flux in decreasing apoptosis. interestingly, inhibition of either camkii or calcineurin increased caspase- <dig> activity significantly more than chronic inflammation alone .

increase in cytosolic calcium activates calcium-induced adenylate cyclase in pancreatic β-cells thereby increasing camp levels. therefore, we assessed whether gpr <dig> activation increased camp in β-cells, which may help inhibit apoptosis. under stimulatory glucose concentrations in β-cells, we found that camp levels were increased  . under chronic inflammatory conditions, camp levels were significantly reduced even in the presence of stimulatory glucose concentrations . this effect was restored by gpr <dig> activation  . to demonstrate the role of gpr40-induced camp on apoptosis, we inhibited a soluble isoform of adcy with adcy inhibitor   <cit> . similar to the data obtained after camkii and calcineurin inhibition, treatment with kh <dig> abolished the impact of gpr <dig> on caspase- <dig> activity  . consistent with the results seen upon plc, camkii and calcineurin inhibition; adcy inhibitor increased caspase- <dig> activity in β-cells significantly more than with inflammation alone , indicating their role for normal β-cell functions. to better understand the role of camp on β-cell apoptosis, we activated adcys to increase camp levels using forskolin under inflammatory conditions and measured its effect on apoptosis. as seen in figure 5a, forskolin significantly reduced caspase- <dig> activity  indicating a key role of camp to inhibit β-cells apoptosis. taken together, our data demonstrate that activation of gpr <dig> reduces inflammation-dependent apoptosis through a mechanism involving plc, camkii, calcineurin and camp.

gpr <dig> activation enhances cell survival signaling
we next examined weather gpr <dig> activation led to cell survival as yet another mechanism to counteract apoptosis. activation of akt/pkb, a known cell survival/growth signal  <cit> , was reduced under chronic inflammatory conditions compared to control conditions . gpr <dig> activation restored akt/pkb phosphorylation under inflammatory conditions  . expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl <dig>  was decreased under chronic inflammatory conditions . activation of gpr <dig> increased bcl <dig> expression under these conditions  . expression of cdkn1a/p <dig>  a cell cycle inhibitor, was also increased under inflammatory conditions , which was reduced by gpr <dig> activation  . further, pdx <dig> expression, which is required for β-cell maintenance, was reduced under inflammatory conditions  and was increased upon gpr <dig> activation  . thus, these data demonstrate that gpr <dig> activation improves β-cell survival and maintenance.

gpr <dig> activation improves insulin synthesis and secretion
to verify that gpr <dig> activation plays a role in decreasing inflammation, we measured its impact on insulin secretion as an indicator of overall β-cell function. we observed impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion under chronic inflammatory conditions , which was significantly improved by gpr <dig> activation  . gpr <dig> activation also led to an increase in insulin secretion from control islets . further, gpr <dig> activation increased cellular atp , which is required for insulin secretion and was decreased under chronic inflammation  . in keeping with these observations, we subsequently assessed the impact of gpr <dig> activation on insulin synthesis. expression of insulin gene was significantly reduced under chronic inflammatory conditions  . activation of gpr <dig> under these conditions increased insulin gene expression  . consistent with the findings of insulin gene expression and insulin secretion, intracellular insulin content was decreased under chronic inflammatory conditions  and was restored by gpr <dig> activation  .based on our findings, we provide a schematic representation of how gpr <dig> activation led to counteract inflammation mediated deleterious effects on pancreatic β-cells . exposure to inflammatory cytokines led to activation of nfκb and jnk which causes increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus creating a positive feed back loop. nfκb and jnk activation lead to increase oxidative and er stress, cytochrome-c release from mitochondria and caspase- <dig> activation thereby causing apoptosis and reduction in insulin synthesis and secretion. activation of gpr <dig> augments cytoplasmic calcium and camp levels which potentiate insulin synthesis and secretion thereby autocrine cell survival signaling. moreover, elevated camp levels reduce activation of nfκb and jnk and hence block inflammatory signaling .

discussion
in this present study we showed that activation of gpr <dig> by a small molecule, cnx-011- <dig>  rescued inflammation-mediated apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. we demonstrated that chronic inflammation, which has been shown to severely impact β-cells’ function and mass  <cit> , caused an augmentation in cellular oxidative and er stress, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines genes and apoptosis. we found that all these impacts of chronic inflammation were reversed by gpr <dig> activation. also we have observed no significant change in the expression of gpr <dig> under inflammation condition with or without the receptor activation .

chronic inflammation has been a mechanism implicated for β-cell apoptosis in both type- <dig> and type- <dig> diabetes  <cit> . hence, it is important to counteract inflammation-mediated changes in β-cells in order to protect them from apoptosis. therefore, we evaluated the potential of gpr <dig> activation as a mechanism to neutralize inflammation mediated consequences. we have activated gpr <dig> using a small molecule agonist  which showed an increase in calcium flux. cnx-011- <dig> is a specific gpr <dig> agonist as it enhanced calcium flux only in cells expressing gpr <dig>  moreover, inhibition of plc reversed cnx-011- <dig> induced calcium flux as gpr <dig> activation mediates its effect via plc-ca2+ pathway  <cit> .

since, inflammatory cytokines exert their effects through activation of jnk and nfκb, we have showed that treatment with gpr <dig> agonist was able to reduce their activation. these findings were also supported by a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines gene expression by gpr <dig> agonist. activation of jnk and nfκb has been shown to up-regulate these pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> , hence their reduced activation by gpr <dig> agonist led to a decreased expression of these genes . thus, gpr <dig> activation not only blocked impact of those inflammatory cytokines added to culture medium but also inhibited their production from β-cells thereby plunging chronic low grade inflammation maintenance.

elevated cellular oxidative and er stress under nutrient overload condition can cause β-cells apoptosis  <cit> . in fact, we also observed increased oxidative and er stress after pro-inflammatory cytokines treatment which was abolished by gpr <dig> agonist. under inflammatory conditions, an increased level of β-cell death was observed as measured by cytochrome-c release, tunel positivity, caspase- <dig> activation and nuclear fragmentation. in consistent with above mentioned findings with gpr <dig> activation, we observed diminished apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells upon gpr <dig> agonist treatment.

in order to dissect the mechanism by which gpr <dig> activation reduced β-cells apoptosis, we used various pharmacological agents to inhibit or activate key intracellular signaling pathways. as expected, inhibition of plc signaling by u <dig> abolished gpr <dig> agonist impact on apoptosis because gpr <dig> exerts its effect by plc activation. interestingly, plc inhibition caused a higher increase in caspase- <dig> activity compared to inflammation alone, indicating its importance for normal physiological functions of β-cells. in fact, elevated glucose level can cause activation of plc signaling in islets  <cit> . activation of plc leads to er calcium release; hence we next tested the role of calcium signaling for gpr <dig> induced reduction in apoptosis. increase in cytoplasmic calcium can lead to activation of calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase  and calcineurin-nfat pathways. in order to specify which of these pathways was involved in the ability of gpr <dig> to counteract inflammation induced apoptosis, we inhibited each of these and observed their effect. inhibition of camkii, the major isoform present in β-cells, showed a pronounced increase in caspase- <dig> activity. similar results were obtained after calcineurin inhibition. interestingly, inhibition of either camkii or calcineurin caused increased caspase- <dig> activity higher than that achieved by inflammation itself, signifying their importance in normal physiology of β-cells.

increase in cytoplasmic calcium level is coupled with an increase in camp level due to presence of calcium activated adcy in β-cells. we tested the possibility that increase in cytoplasmic calcium level by gpr <dig> activation would lead to a corresponding increase in camp level. we found that camp levels were decreased under inflammation condition and were restored by gpr <dig> agonist. to demonstrate the importance of gpr40-induced camp level for caspase- <dig> activity, we inhibited a soluble isoform of adcy present in β-cells which is known to mediate camp oscillation  <cit> . similar to data obtained with plc, camkii and calcineurin inhibitor; inhibition of sadcy caused a drastic increase in caspase- <dig> activity at levels higher than that achieved with inflammation alone. since these inhibitors are known to suppress insulin secretion, their exposure might have reduced autocrine survival ‘insulin-pi3k-akt’ signaling. in contrast, increase in camp level by forskolin led to a significant reduction in caspase- <dig> activity indicating an independent role of camp for reduction in β-cell death. treatment with glp <dig>  which can also increase camp levels, has been shown to reduce apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells  <cit> . thus, our data collectively demonstrate that gpr <dig> activation relayed its signal to multiple arms of intracellular signaling pathways to reduce inflammation mediated apoptosis.

gpr <dig> activation not only inhibited β-cell apoptosis but also activated cell survival pathways. its activation led to an increase in atp level which together with elevated ca2+ and camp level caused a significant increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. this secreted insulin can lead to akt/pkb phosphorylation in an autocrine manner. the level of phosphorylated akt, a well known marker for cell survival and proliferation, was reduced under chronic inflammation conditions, together with a reduction in insulin secretion. gpr <dig> agonist reversed this decrease in pakt level. similarly, bcl <dig> and pdx <dig> expression were reduced under inflammation and were restored by gpr <dig> agonist. pdx <dig> maintains β-cell phenotype and also regulates insulin synthesis. in consistent with pdx <dig> data, inflammation reduced insulin gene transcription and intracellular insulin content and their levels were restored by gpr <dig> agonist. under this condition we did not observe any change in the glucagon expression in rat islets . this is consistence with the fact that gpr <dig> expression in predominant only in β-cells.

we have earlier showed that activation of gpr <dig> by oral administration of cnx-011- <dig> in male zdf rats reduces β-cells apoptosis, increases insulin and pdx <dig> positive cell number and insulin secretion  <cit> . it should be noted that zdf rat is an animal model of diabetes having high chronic systemic inflammation  <cit> . hence, our in vitro data are in agreement with in vivo findings. taken together, our data demonstrate that gpr <dig> activation by cnx-011- <dig> reduces inflammation induced apoptosis, enhances β-cell survival and improves β-cell function as measured by insulin synthesis and secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that activation of gpr <dig>  which is implicated for glucose induced insulin secretion, can rescue pancreatic β-cells from inflammation induced dysfunction. gpr <dig> activation increased cytoplasmic calcium level in a plc dependent manner. we also established the molecular link of gpr <dig> activation and downstream calcium flux to cellular camp levels. gpr <dig> mediated its impact through camkii, nfat and camp as their inhibition totally reversed the protective impact on β-cells apoptosis. moreover, gpr <dig> activation promoted β-cell survival signaling which was impaired under chronic inflammatory conditions. these survival signaling might have been initiated by insulin as gpr <dig> activation led to enhanced insulin secretion. this study provides basis for the development of gpr <dig> activators that might be an effective therapeutic strategy to combat β-cells dysfunction caused by chronic inflammation.
