BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing is a valuable tool for the analysis and study of transcriptomes of non model species  <cit> , especially when resources are limited and a complete re-sequencing of the genome is not practical. transcriptome sequencing allows us to overcome some of the challenges associated with sequencing complex, highly repetitive and large plant genomes.

the lolium-festuca complex is a common name for the grasses belonging to both the lolium genus and broad leaved fescues from the schedonorus subgenus of festuca. both genus are part of the poaceae family  <cit> , but their exact taxonomic relationship is unclear, with reports of a shared common ancestor  <cit>  or the lolium diverging from festuca around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the poaceae family also includes species such as wheat, barley, bamboo, rice, sorghum and sugarcane making it one of the most important plant families from an agricultural, economic and ecological point of view  <cit> . the lolium genus contains ten species  <cit>  all of which are exclusively diploid in nature  <cit> , whereas the festuca genus comprises  <dig> species and the ploidy numbers range from diploid up to dodecaploid  <cit> . the species belonging to the lolium-festuca complex are thought to be closely related and interspecific crosses between some of them occur naturally in the wild. in fact, festuloliums, which are a cross between loliums and fescues are very well established as agriculturally important plants  <cit> . this has led to many discussions as to the exact taxonomy of the complex, as one can find over  <dig> names for the few lolium species  <cit> . however, despite such a close relationship and being universally distributed around the globe, the plants within the complex exhibit significant diversity for agriculturally important traits  <cit>  such as growth speed, root length, forage quality, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, annuality and perenniality. the lolium species generally have a good nutrient content and are highly palatable  <cit> . l.perenne can withstand heavy grazing, and l. multiflorum is characterized by rapid establishment  <cit> . all these traits make them a very good choice for animal fodder. on the other hand, f. pratensis exhibits higher persistence, with a better developed root system allowing it to grow on lower quality soils. it also exhibits resistance to extreme abiotic conditions, such as drought and cold stress, being found as far north as within the arctic circle. introgression of specific traits within the complex are possible and natural hydrids can be found in north-western europe  <cit> .

numerous studies have succesfully introduced important traits from f. pratensis into loliums, including crown rust resistance in l. perenne  <cit>  and l. multiflorum  <cit> , freezing tolerance  <cit>  and drought tolerance in l. multiflorum  <cit> . species from the lolium-festuca complex provide a large pool of genetic variation, both within single species, as well as within the complex. this makes it possible to breed forage and turf vartieties suited for use under a range of environments. not suprisingly, poacea, to which both festuca and lolium belong has been proposed as a model clade for comparative genomics  <cit> . currently well-annotated genomes for this clade are brachypodium distachyon  <cit> , and oryza sativa  <cit>  with ongoing research into hordeum vulgare  <cit> .

the aims of the study were to;  reconstruct the transcriptomes of four species within the lolium-festuca complex: f. pratensis, l. multiforum, l. m. westerwoldicum and l. temulentum. this would complement the already published lolium perenne transcriptome  <cit> ,  establish the phylogeny of the species based on orthologous protein sequences,  identify and compare gene families across the analyzed transcriptomes, and  identify genes under positive selection between the very resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses f. pratensis, and more susceptible lolium species.

RESULTS
de-novo assembly of transcriptomes from the lolium-festuca complex
we focused on generating transcriptome assemblies for four species within the lolium-festuca complex. reads were error-corrected using allpaths-lg tool  <cit> , and assembled using trinity software  <cit>  to produce transcriptome assemblies that varied in transcript number between  <dig>  and  <dig>  after quality filtering for low-read support transcripts . the distribution of transcript length is very similar between the four species , and in all cases a large portion of the assembly is contained within transcripts that are over  <dig> bp in length. we have taken several approaches to evaluate the quality of each assembly and determine how comparable the four assemblies are. first, we identified which transcripts from three closely related species  share the greatest sequence similiarity with transcripts from the four lolium-festuca complex species. we then determined how much overlap there was between the transcript from our de-novo assemblies and the transcript from the related species. a high proportion of the transcripts can be aligned fully  or almost fully  to the transcripts from the related species . the highest number of hits were found to the wheat gene set, the closest relative in this comparison. secondly, we used the cegma pipeline  <cit>  to evaluate the completeness of our assemblies. this is a tool that assesses the presence and coverage of a set of  <dig> extremely conserved core eukaryotic genes . the tool is routinely used for evaluating genomic assemblies, however, it has also been used for evaluating transcriptome assemblies  <cit> . the percentage of complete cegs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the percentage of partially complete cegs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the average number of orthologs per ceg and the % of detected cegs that had more than  <dig> ortholog were similar across the four species. our results point to transcriptome assemblies that reflect a representative portion of the transcriptome complexity, and are comparable between the four species.table  <dig>

comparative gene family analysis
one way of understanding differences between related species on a genome-wide scale is to compare and find contrasts in the entire gene complement of each species. best reciprocal blast hits between genes within a single species suggests the genes are paralogs. best reciprocal blast hits between genes from different species suggests the genes are orthologs, and this strategy is widely used to generate orthologous pairs  <cit> . we used orthomcl  <cit>  in order to compute orthologous clusters for all of our predicted proteins from the four species. we filtered proteins for the longest peptide predicted from a single representative transcript per locus, in order to avoid bias in the creation of the orthologous groups. we generated  <dig>  clusters, assigning  <dig>   to clusters of sizes from  <dig> to  <dig> proteins. the number of proteins contained in all clusters for each species varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

most of the proteins are found in clusters containing genes from at least two species, with  <dig>  gene families shared between all four species . the number of unique  clusters is relatively low, which is not surprising considering that the analyzed species are seperated by very small evolutionary distances. l. multiflorum and l. m. westerwoldicum have the smallest number of species - specific proteins, and many protein sequences that are shared only between these two. again, this is not surprising because l. m. westerwoldicum is a ‘species’ derived from l. multiflorum through selective breeding for annuality  <cit> . out of the gene families identified as unique, two predicted proteins from f. pratensis are showing high sequence identity with a zcct2-a <dig> vrn <dig> homologue from t. urartu . vrn <dig> has an important role in the vernalization/flowering pathway, by preventing the flowering of the plant unless it has experienced a period of cold temperatures and/or short days  <cit> . if there is a cold period, vrn <dig> becomes downregulated and allows the expression of the ft <dig> gene, which promotes flowering  <cit> . f. pratensis is a perennial species with predominantly a strong vernalization requirement  <cit> . all of the other species analyzed are of bi-annual or annual type and have a facultative  or no vernalization requirement . samples for rna-seq were taken from non vernalised plants, and it is therefore not surprising that vrn <dig> has been identified in the transcrtipome assembly of f. pratensis. the lolium species without a vernalisation requirement do not have the vrn <dig> transcript present in their assemblies. a blastp alignment of the identified festuca protein against the other transcriptomes revealed no significant hits. none of the original reads from the other species align back to the predicted vrn <dig> transcript, confiming that the vrn <dig> transcript is not present in the rna-seq data sets of non-perennial species. we know from other studies that vrn <dig> is expressed in a l. perenne which does have a strong vernalization requirement  <cit> . the absence of vrn <dig> expression has been proven to enable ft induction and flowering in the closely related cereals  <cit> . loss of function of vrn <dig> in wheat results in plants that do not require vernalization to flower, and it is the genetic locus responsible for distinguishing spring and winter wheat types  <cit> . our results suggest that vrn <dig> is a key gene for differentiating vernalisation and non-vernalisation requiring species withinin the lolium-festuca complex. other proteins identified as being species-unique included disease resistance proteins for f. pratensis, abc transporter c for l. multiflorum, part of a ubiquitin ligase complex for l. m. westerwoldicum and ubiquin for l. temulentum .figure  <dig>

analysis of clusters with high and low sequence similarity
the average identity of sequences in the orthomcl groups indicates the level of similarity among proteins belonging to that group. the combined average sequence identity  of all protein families was  <dig> %.  <dig> families contained highly conserved proteins, and their %id was equal to  <dig>   <dig>  families have a %id below 80%, constituting less conserved groups. using the david database  <cit>  we have analyzed which functional annotation terms are overrepresented in the groups with different levels of percent sequence identity. go biological process, interproscan, and kegg pathway terms have been used for the annotation. out of the proteins from groups having 100% identity  <dig> sequences could be matched in the david database. they have been grouped into  <dig> clusters enriched for go biological process terms. the most abundant classes of enriched terms include response to abiotic stress, ubiquitination, phosphorus metabolism, electron transport chain, protein localization, response to organic and hormone stimulus, positive regulation of transcription, carbohydrate metabolism, cell cycle, and meiotic cell cycle. enriched kegg pathway terms included purine and pirimidyne metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glycolisis/gluconeogenesis, carbon fixation, biosynthesis of plant hormones, terpenoids, steroids and alkaloids, and citrate cycle. enriched interpro domains were related to ubiquitin, protein kinases, gtpases, atpases, ef hands, and dna/rna helicases. genes responsible for terms like basic metabolic processes related to biosynthesis and degradation, transcriptional and translational activity, protein synthesis and destination and signal transduction are amongst the most conserved in plants  <cit> . the same is true for genes involved in basic cell cycle machinery  <cit> .

the families with a low %id represent proteins with less restrained sequence conservation, with possible multiple copies allowing for more relaxed selection. for the families having below 80%id we have identified  <dig>  ids using david, which group into  <dig> clusters enriched for go biological process terms. clusters with the highest enrichment scores consisted of proteins related to phosphorylation, enzyme linked receptor protein signalling pathway, response to radiation, light and abiotic stimulus, protein ubiquitination, proteolysys and protein catabolic processes, response to organic and hormone stimuli, ion transport, root development, nucleotide metabolic processes and response to hormone stimulus. three clusters were identified for enriched kegg pathways, related to metabolism of methane, cyanoamino acid and glycine, serine and threonine, phenylopropandoid biosynthesis, and gluconeogenesis, biosynthesis of alkaloids and terpenoids.  <dig> clusters have been enriched for interpro domains, with ten highest containing protein kinases, abc transporters, ubiquitin, atpases, zinc fingers, sulfphate ion transporters, dna/rna helicases, ef-hands, egf-like domains, and pas domains. full overview of the go biological process annotation is available in additional file 5: table s <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis based on orthologous gene families
the exact taxonomy of the lolium-festuca complex species is complicated and historically not completely agreed upon, with questions raised about the relationship between different loliums as well as the origin of the species. the genus festuca is considered to be ancestral to the genus lolium, as it incorporates far more species and contains natural polyploids  <cit> . evidence exists for both  the evolution of loliums from a perennial festuca subgenus schedonorus ancestor  <cit> , and  a common ancestral form for both lolium and festuca  <cit> . some reports are in favor of classifying the genus lolium as part of the schedonorus  <cit> . in general, the lolium genus can be separated based on self-pollinating or out-pollinating behaviour. the most recent and complete analyses of the lolium-festuca complex reports the crown age of the lolium - festuca complex to be  <dig>  +-  <dig>  ma. it also reports the f. pratensis to have originated in the southwest asia around  <dig> million years ago, and the loliums to have first diversified in the eastern mediterranean region around  <dig>  ma  <cit> .

in our study we performed the phylogenetic analysis using the orthologous groups identified by orthomcl. the clustering output was further filtered for conserved orthologous genes as a representative from each species - that is, having exactly one representative in the cluster for each of the species.  <dig> groups fulfilled this criteria. using these groups we inferred gene trees  which were then clustered using the phylip tool to infer a consensus tree . it is important to note that gene trees were calculated based solely on the gene-coding regions obtained from assembled transcriptome sequences only. the numbers on the branches indicate the number of times the species are partitioned into the two sets . this means, that the branch topology has the highest support, or has been represented most commonly in the input trees. however, we find that a high proportion of the original trees have a different topology. this points to a different phylogenetic relationship depending on the group of orthologous proteins analyzed. these findings make sense in light of the fact that some of the species in the complex are interfertile. the fact that introgression of genes is possible within the complex has been utilized in breeding efforts as well as in research  <cit> . the genomes of modern grass species are a result of more complex evolutionary mechanisms, and reticulate evolution in the complex has been previously proposed  <cit> . the consensus tree  strongly corresponds to the possible phylogeny of the poaceae family reported in  <cit> .figure  <dig>

genes under positive selection pressure in lolium species compared to f. pratensis
we can identify two types of changes in the coding sequences - non synonymous  substitutions, leading to change in the amino acid sequence, and synonymous  substitutions, which are neutral for the amino acid sequence. the ratio of non-synonymous substitution rate  and synonymous substitution rate  is a parameter widely used to assess whether there is any directional selection acting on a protein coding gene. a ratio <  <dig> indicates that the protein is under purifying selection, whereas a ratio of >  <dig> is a good indication of positive selection pressure  <cit> . in such a closely related clade, only a small amount of genes can be expected to be responsible for phenotypical differences  <cit> . we undertook pairwise comparison of transcriptome datasets. putative orthologous genes have been then classified according to the best bi-directional blast criteria , and for every comparison we selected transcript pairs with a ka/ks ratio above  <dig>  we have focused on comparing the f. pratensis with the other analyzed species, as it has various features that are important from an agricultural perspective, which include superior biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, good persistency and perenniality. the sequence identity distribution is very uniform among the pairwise comparison, with it’s peak around 95% . we focused our analysis towards genes involved in stress resistance, cell cycle and development related proteins, with the most relevant ones identified listed for every comparison. the overall distribution of ka/ks ratio of all pairwise comparisons is very similar, with almost every pair of proteins showing signs of purifying selection . the median ratio was very consistent, between  <dig>  for l. multiflorum and  <dig>  for l. perenne.figure  <dig>

ka/ks distribution. the figure presents comparison of f. pratensis against l. temulentum, l.m. westerwoldicum, l. multiflorum and l. perenne. the frequency distributions of ka/ks rates  shown here are based on protein and nucleotide alignments of orthologous genes.



the number of orthologous pairs for which ka and ks could be calculated and was above  <dig> was equal to:  <dig> for f. pratensis and l. multiflorum ,  <dig> for f. pratensis and l. m. westerwoldicum ,  <dig> for f. pratensis and l. temulentum ,  <dig> for f. pratensis and l. perenne . all of the pairs have been linked to their functional annotations. we have then categorized the transcript pairs that are under positive pressure in multiple comparisons, by checking how many festuca identifiers are being shared between the pairwise comparisons . the majority of pairs have shown ka/ks values over  <dig> in only a single pair-wise comparison. however, there were three pairs shared in every analyzed comparison, and thus differentiating the festuca from the lolium species. the first was a homologue of a. thaliana ribosomal protein l <dig>  one of the primary rrna binding proteins  <cit> , and the second was a unc93-like protein  <dig>  which is an integral component of the cell membrane  <cit> . in addition, in every pairwise comparison we detected a homologue of disease resistance protein rpm <dig>  involved in plant defense against p. syringae in a. thaliana  <cit> . a homologue to disease resistance protein rpp <dig> conferring resistance to peronospora parasitica in a. thaliana  <cit>  has been identified in l. perenne, l. multiflorum and l. temulentum comparisons. other proteins involved in plant-pathogen interaction, rpp <dig> and rph8a, have been found in the l. multiflorum comparison. different types of f-box proteins, which are mediating protein-protein interactions, were also abundant in every pairwise comparison.figure  <dig>

because f. pratenesis and l. perenne are perennial plants, and l. multiflorum, l. m. westerwoldicum and l. temulentum have a bi-annual or annual growth cycle, protein types present in every type of comparison except for f. pratensis - l.perenne have been closely investigated. one example of such proteins are cyclins, family of conserved proteins responsible for the control of cell-cycle progression  <cit> . cyclin t1- <dig>  has been identified in all comparisons except for the comparison with l.perenne. other cyclins, t1- <dig> and t1- <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase f- <dig> have been identified in pairwise comparisons with l. temulentum e <dig> ubiquitin ligases have also been identified in every comparison apart from l.perenne - rnf <dig> in l. multiflorum, rfwd <dig> in l. m. westerwoldicum and rnf <dig> in l. temulentum. additionally, multiple diverse transcription factors have been identified in non - l.perenne comparisons. these proteins constitute a group worth investigation of the perenniality/annuality trait genetic background.

when analyzing pfam domains, the most abundant classes in every comparison were leucine rich repeats, aaa domains and tetratricopepdide repeats. all three of those protein domains can be found in proteins involved in diverse functions - such as protein-protein interactions, transcription factors, protein degradation and signal transduction. the full list of annotated proteins and pfam domains is available in additional file  <dig> 

apart from the pairwise comparisons of festuca to lolium species, we have also performed a comparison of l. multiflorum and l. m. westerwoldicum, assuming that a large amount of changes on the molecular level might have been caused by human influence  <cit> . it is an interesting comparison as l. m. westerwoldicum was developed by selecting l. multiflorum plants for annuality. a very high number of positively selected orthologous pairs -  <dig> - has been identified for these two species . as the main difference between the species is the strictly annual habit of l. m. westerwoldicum, apart from the basic metabolism and disease resistance we were also interested in proteins related to development and perenniality-annuality cycle. annotations extracted from the previously created annotation files  included multiple ubiquitin protein ligases as well as cyclin-t1- <dig>  multiple disease resistance proteins have been identified: two rga <dig> proteins,  <dig> rpm <dig> and one rpp <dig> protein. among the pfam domain annotations we have found one that is related to seed dormancy control , and two genes with a anaphase-promoting complex subunit . we have also identified multiple domains associated with sugar metabolism, such as fructose-1-6-bisphosphatase , sugar efflux transporter for intercellular exchange , mfs/sugar transport protein  and sugar transporter . another interesting category of domains included drought induced  <dig> protein   and arabidopsis broad-spectrum mildew resistance protein . in spite of the extremely close phylogenetic distance, the amount and diversity of proteins under putative positive selection between those two species is very high, likely reflecting the intense selection pressure applied during the breeding of l. m. westerwoldicum from l. multiflorum.

many of the enriched terms identified as being positively selected in this study share functions comparable to the ones in similar analyses  <cit> . terms associated with protein kinases, protein phospthatases, transcription regulation and glycotransferases are linked to disease resistance  <cit> , which are one of the fastest evolving and critical proteins in plant evolution. terms related to stress response were present in almost every comparison, which is not suprising given the phenotypic background of the plants. the vrn <dig> gene has been identified as being important for determining spring or winter wheat varieties  <cit> . we have often observed terms related to reproductive structure development. seeds and fruit size are one of the most distinct differences between wild and domesticated plants. l. temulentum is considered to be a mimic weed of wheat, and as such it has been involuntarily domesticated alongside that species  <cit> . breeding of perennial grasses has a much shorter history, with the earliest records of it starting around  <dig> years ago  <cit> . however, given the intensity of modern breeding programs and the fact that f. pratensis, l. multiflorum and l. m. westerwoldicum plants used in our study are a result of a directed breeding effort, it might be worth investigating if some of the observed variation could be related to domestication like processes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first de-novo transcriptome assemblies for four species from the lolium-festuca complex, and uses them to perform comparative transcritpomics. the orthologous genes between the species have a very high sequence similarities , and the majority of gene families were shared for all of them. a consensus phylogenetic tree based on our large set of one-to-one orthologous genes is in agreement with the most recent study that was based on nuclear ribosomal intergenic spacer and plastid trnt-l and trnl-f regions. it is likely that the knowledge of the genomes will be largely transferable between species within the complex.
