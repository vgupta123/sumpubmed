BACKGROUND
yak  and cattle  separated about  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years ago 
 <cit> . while cattle have a worldwide distribution in most of the low lands, the yak has dominated in high lands especially around the hindu kush-himalayan region and the qinghai-tibetan plateau , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  m above sea level. the yak is one of the world’s most remarkable domestic animals, and has been reported as a typical four season grazing ruminant in the qtp 
 <cit> . in order to adapt to the harsh environment with severe cold, less oxygen, strong ultra-violet  radiation, and poor forage resources, yaks have evolved special adaptations in physiology, nutrient metabolism and foraging 
 <cit> .

recently, shao et al 
 <cit>  anatomically compared the yak tongue with the cattle tongue, and found that the yak tongue was better adapted to the harsh characteristics of tibetan pasture. other recent studies have shown that yaks have an efficient nitrogen metabolism, suggesting an adaptation mechanism to their low-n dietary ingestion under harsh grasslands conditions of the qtp area 
 <cit> . subsequently, using the sulfur-hexafluoride  tracer technique, ding et al 
 <cit>  measured the enteric methane emissions of yak in the qtp area and showed that yaks produce less methane  compared to other ruminants, such as cattle.

greenhouse gases have become a major issue in the world and ruminant livestock are an important source of global enteric methane. enteric methane gas is produced by microorganisms, called methanogens, in the digestive tract of ruminant livestock during digestion of feed and represents a direct loss of gross energy intake that could more efficiently be used by the animal for increased productivity 
 <cit> . thus, reducing enteric methane production could benefit ruminants energetically, provided that the digestion efficiency and animal production traits are not compromised. the yak has great potential as an “energy-saving” animal as many researchers around the world aim to find “low carbon” livestock.

the identification of inhibitors of methanogenesis is currently being explored. however, the successful use of these agents is dependant upon having a better understanding of the hydrogenotrophic microbial community in the rumen, which must be promoted in the absence of the methanogenic archaea for production benefits to occur. as a potential “low carbon” animal, yaks are adapted to a cold and high altitude environment and are reported to produce less methane than cattle per unit body weight 
 <cit> . thus, the yak, which is well adapted to its environment, may harbor a rumen methanogen population that produces less methane than cattle. therefore, it is necessary to study the hydrogenotrophic microbial community by comparing the rumen methanogen diversity of yaks and cattle. the phylogenetic analysis of bacterial diversity in yak has been studied previously 
 <cit> , whereas the methanogen diversity in yak has yet to be investigated.

this study aims to generate new knowledge pertaining to the rumen methanogens of the yak and will contribute to the identification of the microbiology that constitutes a low-methane emitting ruminant animal. to our knowledge, this is the first investigation on the diversity of rumen methanogens from the yak.

RESULTS
sequence similarity analysis
in the yak 16s rrna gene clone library, a total of  <dig> clones were examined and  <dig> clones were identified as chimeras and excluded from further analyses. the remaining  <dig> clones revealed  <dig> unique sequences . of these,  <dig> sequences belonged to the thermoplasmatales-affiliated lineage c , with only  <dig> % to  <dig> % identity to methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis. the remaining  <dig> sequences were related to archaeal taxa from the orders methanobacteriales, methanomicrobiales and methanosarcinales. of these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> belonged within the order methanobacteriales and were broken down as follows:  <dig> sequences were  <dig> % to  <dig> % related to methanobrevibacter millerae, four sequences had  <dig> % to  <dig> % identity to methanobrevibacter ruminantium, and four sequences were  <dig> % to  <dig> % related to methanobrevibacter smithii. only one sequence was related to methanogens from the order methanomicrobiales, with  <dig> % identity to methanomicrobium mobile, whereas four sequences belonged to the order methanosarcinales with only  <dig> % to  <dig> % identity to methanimicrococcus blatticola.

mbb.= methanobrevibacter; mms=methanomassiliicoccus; mmb=methanomicrobium; mmc=methanimicrococcus.

*16s sequences were obtained from mothur program as unique sequences, while otus were generated by the mothur program at 98% species level identity.

in the cattle 16s rrna gene library, a total of  <dig> clones was examined, of which  <dig> clones were identified as chimeras and excluded from the analysis. the remaining  <dig> sequences revealed  <dig> unique sequences . a total of  <dig> sequences  were only  <dig> % to  <dig> % related to methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, whereas  <dig> sequences  were  <dig> % to  <dig> % related to methanogens belonging to the order methanobacteriales and six sequences  were  <dig>  to  <dig> % related to those belonging to the order methanomicrobiales. the remaining two sequences  were  <dig> % and  <dig> % related to methanimicrococcus blatticola within the order methanosarcinales. within the methanobacteriales,  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences were  <dig> % to  <dig> % identical to methanobrevibacter millerae, two sequences  were  <dig>  to  <dig> % related to methanobrevibacter gottschalkii; one sequence  was only  <dig> % related to methanobrevibacter arboriphilus; and three sequences  were 99%.  <dig> % and  <dig> % related to methanobrevibacter ruminantium, methanobrevibacter smithii and methanobrevibacter wolinii, respectively.

using a species-level identity criterion of 98% 
 <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> otus had less than 98% identity to any valid recognized taxa, and may represent potential new methanogen species and strains.

statistical analysis of libraries
the yak library had a shannon index of  <dig> ± <dig>  while the cattle library had a shannon index of  <dig> ± <dig> . libshuff analysis showed that the differences between the yak and cattle libraries at 98% identity were significant .

phylogenetic placement of sequences
distance-matrix phylogenetic trees are provided showing the phylogenetic placement of the methanogen sequences from the yak and cattle  clone libraries. methanogen sequences from yak and cattle grouped with methanogens from the uncharacterized talc group , as well as the orders methanobacteriales, methanomicrobiales, methanosarcinales .
1a, and  <dig> otus from talc group are presented in figure 
1b. genbank accession number are indicated in parentheses and bootstrap values  from  <dig> replications are indicated on the tree.the scale bar corresponds to  <dig> changes per  <dig> positions.

in total,  <dig> clones were analyzed, revealing  <dig> unique sequences , which were assigned to  <dig> otus . examination of these  <dig> otus revealed that,  <dig> otus were unique to the yak clone library and  <dig> otus were unique to the cattle clone library , while  <dig> otus  were found in both libraries as shared otus.

discussion
the yak is a key species in the qinghai tibetan plateau. it provides herders with milk, meat, fiber, fuel and draught power, but also plays a key role in the management of the alpine rangeland ecosystem 
 <cit> . this ecological niche is unique and no other animal species can substitute the yak at such harsh environments . research on the yak production system is therefore highly strategic and in recent years, adaptations of physiology, nitrogen and energy metabolism, histological variations, and foraging behavior to the harsh forage environment have been revealed 
 <cit> . however, research focusing on the rumen microbiota of the yak, has been limited until now. based upon the libshuff analysis, the current study has shown that the community structure of the methanogens resident in the yak is significantly different  from that of cattle, with only  <dig> of the  <dig> otus shared between the two libraries.

the rumen is a unique environment which inhabits billions of microorganisms, including bacteria, methanogenic archaea, protozoa and fungi. common species of methanogens isolated from rumen belong to the genera, methanobrevibacter, methanomicrobium, methanobacterium and methanosarcina <cit> . in the present study, the majority of methanogen sequences were very distantly related to methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis  and were found to belong to the thermoplasmatales-affiliated lineage c, a group of uncultivated and uncharacterized rumen archaea that is a distantly related sister group to the order thermoplasmatales . tajima et al 
 <cit>  also reported the methanogen diversity of the bovine rumen exhibited high degrees of similarity to uncultured archaea which were distantly related to the order thermoplasmatales. wright et al 
 <cit>  also reported that  <dig> of  <dig> unique sequences from australia sheep had  <dig> to 75% identity to thermoplasmatales and were considered as predominant sequences in the rumen. in present study, within the talc clade, few unique otus from yak and cattle libraries were highly related to the clones m1and m <dig> from holstein cattle in japan 
 <cit> , clones csiro  <dig>  and csiro  <dig>  from sheep in western australia 
 <cit> , and clones vadin ca <dig> and vadin dc <dig> from a wine anaerobic digester in france 
 <cit> .

the distribution of 16s rrna gene sequences within the orders of methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales also varied between yak and cattle clone libraries. from the results, it was apparent that a greater percentage of the methanogen population from the orders of methanobacteriales  and methanomicrobiales  were found in the rumen of cattle as compared to the yak.

zhou et al 
 <cit>  studied the methanogen diversity in cattle with different feed efficiencies and reported that differences at the strain and genotype levels of metagenomic ecology were found to be associated with feed efficiency in the host regardless of the population of methanogens. it was also suggested that the microbial ecology at the species, strain and genus levels in the rumen may play important roles in contributing to the difference in the methane gas production.

a recent investigation found that condensed tannins could exhibit a reduction in methane production in an in vitro gas production test 
 <cit> . further investigation into the diversity of 16s rrna gene library of rumen methanogen in the condensed tannin treatment library revealed  <dig> % higher diversity of sequences related to the talc methanogens and a lower diversity of those associated with orders methanobacteriales  and methanomicrobiales  
 <cit> . this shows a possible association between reduction in methane production and diversity of rumen methanogen. in the current study, yak has present higher methanogen diversity and significant different methanogen community structures compared with cattle . while there are many factors which may explain these differences in methanogen diversity, it is possible that these differences between the methanogen diversity in yak and cattle could be related to the significant difference in enteric methane production by both these ruminant species.

long 
 <cit>  reported a significantly high level of propionic acid, which leads to efficient energy utilization and this further suggested a low methane production in yak. yak has also been found to exhibit lower methane output 
 <cit> . in the present study, yak had higher levels of acetate, proprionate, isobutyric, isovaleric and total volatile fatty acids than cattle, but cattle had higher acetate to proprionate  ratios . this may also suggest different methanogenesis pathways. therefore, the diversity and community structure of methanogens in yak, which is the lower methane producing ruminant species in current study, correlates with data reported by tan et al 
 <cit> .

* concentrations of volatile fatty acids was analysed by gas chromatograph equipped with a db-ffap column .

wright et al 
 <cit>  revealed  <dig> sequences of methanogens by phylogenetic analysis from the australian sheep rumen, and  <dig> of them belonged to the genus methanobrevibacter. they were grouped with methanobrevibacter nt <dig>  methanobrevibacter sm <dig>  methanobrevibacter m <dig>  methanobrevibacter ruminantium, methanobrevibacter acididurans and methanobrevibacter thaueri. from the present study , clones related to methanobrevibacter olleyae, methanobrevibacter ruminantium, methanobrevibacter woesei, methanobrevibacter smithii, methanobrevibacter millerae, methanobrevibacter gottschalkii, and methanobrevibacter thaueri were reported in the yak. however, in contrast with the yak library, methanobrevibacter wolinii was only found in the cattle library. clones related to methanimicrococcus blatticola and methanomicrobium mobile were found in both libraries.

bacteria and methanogens has constantly interacted with each other in the rumen microbial communities 
 <cit> , sustainable growth of bacteria and methanogen in syntrophic communities depend on transfer of hydrogen and formate and reverse electron transfer 
 <cit> . in the present study, methanogens from the talc cluster were the dominant sequences in the yak and cattle rumen in the qtp area. however, the metabolic mechanism of this methanogen group is not yet clear; the investigation of fermentive bacteria species in yak and cattle could help understanding these syntrophic microbial communities.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study revealed for the first time the molecular diversity of methanogen community in yaks and cattle in qinghai-tibetan plateau area in china. the differences in methanogen diversity found in the present study, may help to explain, to some extent, the differences associated with the low methane production contributed to the adaptation of the yak to the harsh forage environment in the qinghai-tibetan plateau. yaks have co-evolved with a unique rumen microbial ecosystem that is significantly different from that of cattle, even when feed similar diets. understanding these particularities will yield development of technology for reducing methane emission intensity by optimizing dietary conditions to exploit the full potential of the yak ruminal ecosystem and function. however, native grazing might be a limited factor for this experiment, since feed intake could significantly influence the rumen microbiota. this study also contributes to the understanding of the specific features of the rumen microbial ecosystem of yaks which have adapted to high altitude ecosystems which may help to explain the differential rates of methanogenesis compared to cattle.
