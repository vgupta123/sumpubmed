BACKGROUND
equine recurrent laryngeal neuropathy 
is a common upper respiratory tract disorder of horses and a significant cause of
their reduced athletic performance  <cit> . rln represents a distal axonopathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerves,
which is clinically expressed only on the left side of the larynx. interestingly,
the left nerve is the longest nerve in horses  <cit> . rln is also a mononeuropathy, as other peripheral nerves of the horse
remain unaffected  <cit> . as a result of the axonal degeneration, secondary paresis to complete
paralysis of the intrinsic laryngeal abductor and adductor muscles ensues. although
rln results in fiber-type grouping in all of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, it is
neurogenic atrophy of one particular abductor, the musculus cricoarytenoideus
dorsalis , that prevents maximal abduction of the arytenoid cartilage
and contributes to the development of airway obstruction. the degree of cad
paresis/paralysis is graded endoscopically from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  and a significant correlation between the laryngeal grade and the
histopathological changes of the cad has been documented  <cit> .

recurrent laryngeal neuropathy is an important axonopathy for horses in competitive
events, because the resultant paresis of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles leads to
obstruction of air flow during intense exercise, an abnormal inspiratory noise known
as “roaring,” and, most importantly, reduced performance. despite its
importance, however, the etiology of the axonopathy is unknown. rln has particular
economic importance in thoroughbred racehorses because these animals enter race
training as 2-year-olds. even though all horses going through sales are
endoscopically examined for evidence of rln, the condition may not yet be clinically
evident in some animals  <cit>  so a diagnostic test to predict rln risk would be very useful.

the prevalence of rln varies, ranging from between 2-11% in thoroughbreds  <cit>  and 35-46% in the draft horse breeds  <cit> . in draft breeds, taller horses are at greater risk of developing rln,
but the relationship between height and rln in thoroughbreds has not been clearly
defined  <cit> . from a genetic point of view, all modern thoroughbreds originated from
three stallions imported into england in the 17th and 18th
century that were crossbred to local mares  <cit> . as a consequence of this restricted founder stock and strong selection
for racing performance, modern thoroughbreds exhibit low genetic diversity and high
linkage disequilibrium  <cit> , making them particularly well suited to identify genetic associations
using a genome-wide association study  approach.

the presence of genetic factors contributing to the pathogenesis of rln is suggested
by the observation that offspring of rln-affected stallions are more likely to be
affected with the disorder than are offspring from unaffected stallions  <cit> . elucidating the genetic mechanism causing the disease is of particular
research interest since, unlike most myelinopathies, rln manifests itself as a
bilateral mononeuropathy  <cit> . however, the genetics of rln have not been extensively investigated. a
gwas of rln has been conducted  <cit>  in a mixed population of horses consisting of  <dig> cases  and  <dig> breed-matched controls. using
a haplotype-based approach based on illumina equine snp <dig> genotypes, the
investigators identified two protective loci in the warmblood horses on chromosomes
 <dig>  and 31
 associated
with rln. neither of these chromosome regions contained regions associated with
neuropathies in other mammals or candidate genes that could be immediately linked to
peripheral neuropathy. the present study reports on use of a newer illumina equine
snp <dig> beadchip to conduct a gwas on a large cohort of thoroughbred horses that were
phenotypically characterized for rln and height. specifically, we sought to identify
risk loci associated with rln and in doing so, gain additional insight into the
etiopathogenesis of this disease. because of the clinically reported connection
between height and rln, we also examined their genetic association.

methods
horses
the protocol for phenotypic characterization and obtaining blood samples and the
informed consent forms were approved by the animal use and care committee of
michigan state university  and cornell university. information on the risks
and benefits of the investigation was provided to the horse trainers/owners and
informed consent was signed before at the time the sample was taken. phenotypic
data and venous blood samples  were obtained
from  <dig> thoroughbred horses evaluated by large-animal specialists from two
veterinary teaching hospitals 
and by participating board-certified veterinary surgeons at private practices
throughout the us . a total of  <dig> horses at least
2 years old had recorded heights. in each unsedated horse, a
videoendoscopic examination of the larynx was performed and a laryngeal grade of
 <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  was assigned. this grade was derived following observation of
laryngeal movements during eupneic breathing, after induced-swallowing, and
after nasal occlusion maneuvers. cases , which were largely
obtained from participating veterinary surgeons, were horses requiring
corrective surgery for rln. they had laryngeal grades of  <dig> and 4
 and their median age
was 3 years . controls, with a median age of
6 years  had laryngeal scores of  <dig> , were
obtained from broodmare farms, private stables, veterinary hospital admissions,
and two racetracks. sixteen putative controls received intermediate laryngeal
grades  and were excluded from the rln association analysis. with the
exception of  <dig> three year-old horses, all of the control horses were at least
4 years old. all of the control horses were examined by either veterinary
teaching hospital faculty or participating veterinary surgeons. because, in 15%
of horses, rln may grade change later in life  <cit> , a few of the control animals may have developed rln at a later age,
although excluding the  <dig> three-year old controls did not materially affect the
results. height at withers measurements was reported to the nearest quarter hand
 and converted to centimeters.

samples submitted by practitioners were shipped on dry ice to the pulmonary
laboratory, msu and then stored at -20°c. all samples were then processed
by personnel in the cornell veterinary biobank  <cit> . dna was extracted by use of a dna purification kit , and the concentration  and quality  of each sample was determined.
two μg aliquots of dna were allocated into 96-well plates and stored at
-20°c until samples were genotyped at the cornell university biotechnology
resource center.

genotyping
the  <dig> thoroughbred samples were genotyped using illumina equine snp <dig> arrays
containing  <dig>  markers. genotype calls were made in genomestudio using a
gencall threshold of  <dig> . twenty samples with high missingness were re-run and
an additional  <dig> samples passing qc were run multiple times as technical
replicates. a total of  <dig>  snps were excluded for high missingness 
and  <dig>  monomorphic or rare snps  were excluded. duplicate concordance at the
remaining sites was > <dig> %.

for the final dataset, only one array per sample was retained, and an additional
seven samples were excluded because their imputed genotypic sex did not match
the phenotypic records, indicating a possible misidentification of these
samples. two snps  were excluded because they
showed evidence of probe hybridization to multiple genomic locations, and two
other snps  were excluded due to low duplicate
concordance rates. additionally,  <dig> markers were excluded for high
heterozygosity  and  <dig> were excluded for low heterozygosity
;
filtering was more relaxed for low heterozygosity because population structure
would be expected to depress heterozygosity somewhat from hardy-weinberg
expectation. the final unphased dataset contained  <dig> horses genotyped at  <dig> 
markers with a mean call rate of  <dig> %. principal component analysis was
computed using eigenstrat  <cit>  and revealed no evidence of batch effects or significant population
stratification in the dataset . phenotypic data for these  <dig> horses are summarized in .

genome-wide association was performed using gemma  <cit>  after imputation of missing genotypes using shapeit v <dig>  <cit> . in all cases, association analysis was performed by means of a wald
test using the centered relatedness matrix calculated by gemma. however,
comparison of these association results with standard association tests  revealed very little evidence of
p-value inflation due to population structure in our cohort . we used a bonferroni significance
cutoff of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  conservatively estimating
 <dig>  independent comparisons  and a
family-wise error rate of α =  <dig> .

to assess association to haplotypes in the eca <dig> candidate region a set of snps
centered on biec2_ <dig> and encompassing approximately 2 mb
 was selected. we further filtered this set to
include only markers with a genotyping rate > 99% and a
maf >  <dig> , leaving  <dig> remaining markers. linkage disequilibrium
between markers was examined using haploview v <dig>   <cit> . haplotype associations to height and rln status were tested by a
general linear model or chi-square test using a sliding window of between  <dig> and
 <dig> snps in plink  <cit> . regression modeling of the effect of height and putative rln loci
was done with general linear models using r with the package stats   <cit> .

RESULTS
association mapping of rln
using the full case–control dataset  and correcting for sex and gelding, the strongest association with rln
was centered on a snp, biec2_ <dig>  adjacent to the ligand-dependent nuclear
receptor corepressor-like  and non-smc condensing i complex,
subunit g  genes
. although this locus only explains 6%
of the variation in rln in our cohort, we estimated that our full dataset
explained  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of the variation in rln score after
accounting for sex and gelding. this locus has previously been associated with
height in horses  <cit> . including height as an additional covariate in the model  yielded no significant associations after
correcting for population structure, although regions of chromosomes 23
 and chromosome  <dig> . gwas for rln without covariates
also yielded an additional suggestive association on chrx at  <dig>  mb
. the effect of the
lcorl/ncapg and chromosome  <dig> qtls was consistent between males and
females whereas the chromosome  <dig> qtl appeared stronger in females and the
chromosome x qtl appeared stronger in males . gwas for rln including biec2_ <dig> genotype as a covariate did not
reveal any additional associated regions .

association mapping of body size
we performed gwas on height using sex  as a
categorical covariate for the  <dig> horses of at least two years of age with
recorded heights . the strongest
association signal
 centered
on the same snp, biec2_ <dig>  in lcorl/ncapg locus that was the
strongest association for rln. all  <dig> snps passing the bonferroni significance
threshold were in this region . we estimated that
the entire snp <dig> panel explains  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of the variation in
withers height after accounting for sex and gelding  <cit> .

although height differed significantly between mares, geldings, and stallions,
sex and gelding only explained  <dig> % of the variation in height in the samples.
in contrast the lcorl/ncapg minor  allele count at biec2_ <dig> had
an effect of increasing height  <dig>  cm  and explained  <dig> % of
the variation in height in the dataset. this effect was roughly additive and
consistent in sires, mares, and geldings . a
model incorporating sex, gelding, and biec2_ <dig> explained  <dig> % of the
variance in height, and was not improved by adding age to the model
. gwas
for height including biec2_ <dig> genotype as a covariate did not reveal any
additional associated regions .

correlated genetic signatures of rln and height
a binomial regression model showed that height and lcorl/ncapg were
strongly correlated with rln even after accounting for sex and gelding
. although the variables were
correlated, they were both significant in the full model for rln, jointly
incorporating the effects of sex, gelding, height, and the putative rln loci on
eca  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x .

because of the similar gwas results for height and rln, we used bivariate
restricted maximum likelihood  analysis  <cit>  to estimate the genetic correlation between height and quantitative
rln score. bivariate reml estimates of “chip heritability” after
accounting for sex and gelding were remarkably similar to our lmm estimates
, and the estimated genomic
correlation between height and rln was nearly complete
. chromosomes  <dig> and x explained the largest
proportion of the variance in height and were also significantly associated with
rln severity, although other chromosomes also show elevated associations with
rln .

haplotype analysis revealed that height is associated with an eight snp block
spanning eca3: 105363241– <dig> . this
genomic region includes both the lcorl and ncpg genes
. the haplotype generating the smallest
p-value for rln is a seven snp block overlapping with the height block by two
markers  . this block spans eca3:
105829484– <dig> and includes the 5’ half of the fam184b
gene . examination of the  <dig> chromosomes
phased using shapeit revealed that  <dig> chromosomes bear both the rln and
height-associated haplotype blocks. only one chromosome possessed the height
block but not the rln haplotype.  <dig> chromosomes contained the rln haplotype but
not the height associated block, leaving  <dig> chromosomes possessing only other
haplotypes.

 and height . candidate genes lcorl and
ncapg are encompassed by the height haplotype, while a

discussion
the selective breeding of domestic animals for desirable traits has often been
accompanied by the appearance of genetically determined undesirable characteristics:
examples include malignant hyperthermia in swine selected for rapid increase in
muscle mass, osteoporosis in chickens selected for high rates of egg production, and
hyperkalemic periodic paralysis in quarterhorses selected for muscular appearance.
in general, horses have been selectively bred for power and speed. the former
requires size and muscle mass while the latter requires height , a
compact muscle mass close to the trunk, and high rates of maximal oxygen
consumption. although selection for height apparently has been accompanied by an
increased prevalence of rln, the genetic basis for this is currently unknown.

the current study, which used the largest cohort of rln-affected and unaffected
horses ever assembled from a single breed revealed a very strong genetic correlation
between rln and height. this association was previously well known across breeds
, but
has never been demonstrated over the small range of heights 
spanned in the present study. this was evident not only in the clinical observations
, but also in the gwas results. the haplotype
associations for height and rln were coincident and the genetic correlation between
the traits was >90%.

the phenotype of rln was defined based on the presence  or absence 
of endoscopically visible failure of abduction of the left arytenoid and associated
vocal fold. this clinical and functional definition was used because veterinarians
in the field use it and because it has important implications for athletic
performance. there were two reasons for selection of grade  <dig> as the threshold score
for a case: first, horses with this grade are unable to maintain vocal fold
abduction and therefore require surgical correction to restore their performance;
and second, failure of abduction is easily recognized endoscopically by experienced
veterinarians . however, histopathological examination of
the intrinsic muscles of the larynx can reveal muscle fiber-type regrouping
 in some horses
that do not have clinical evidence of laryngeal paresis  <cit>  and therefore would be controls under the definition used in the present
investigation. furthermore, foals can demonstrate fiber-type regrouping at birth  <cit>  and ponies have fiber-type regrouping but rarely develop the clinical
syndrome. definition of cases and controls based on the presence or absence of
fiber-type regrouping is not currently practical, and it is possible that clinical
expression of rln involves factors other than just changes in muscle fiber type.

recently, several independent studies have documented strong associations between the
lcorl/ncapg region and body size in the horse  <cit> , but no conclusive causative mutation has been detected to date. a role
for both lcorl and ncapg in growth is supported by well-validated
associations to human height  <cit> , and to fetal growth rate in cattle  <cit> .

within the thoroughbred breed, the eca <dig> locus appears to have the single largest
effect on withers height . previous work in 16
diverse breeds selected for extreme body size identified three significant loci in
addition to eca <dig>  as well as a
thoroughbred-specific qtl on eca <dig>  but no signal for these loci was detected in
this dataset  <cit> . although marker coverage for hmga <dig> is poor on the illumina
snp <dig> product, the same markers for zfat are included in this analysis and
segregate at ~ 20% in our cohort, but do not appear to impact withers height. the
association of zfat with height is replicated in a study of  <dig> 
franches-montagnes horses  <cit> , suggesting the effect of the size qtl near zfat may be
dependent on genetic background. the previous estimate that 59% of the variation in
height in thoroughbreds was explained by lcorl/ncapg and the qtl
on eca <dig> is significantly higher than our estimate of 24% based on the entire snp
dataset. this may reflect an overestimation in their analysis due to small sample
size  or an underestimation in ours due to the small range of
thoroughbred heights, environmental variability, and/or measurement error.

our study confirms anecdotal evidence and previous reports in draft breeds
identifying an association between rln and large size in horses  <cit> . however, the nature of this association remains unknown. certainly,
large body size will increase the overall length of the recurrent laryngeal nerve,
perhaps increasing the risk for mechanical injury of the nerve during athletic
performance or for damage associated with defects in axonal transport.
alternatively, lcorl and ncapg are genes encoding transcription
factors and could have diverse targets with varying physiological functions. thus,
the same causative mutation may be implicated for both body size and rln phenotypes.
lastly, given extensive ld across the eca <dig> locus, rln and body size may be
influenced by two independent genetic changes associated by linkage. further work
will be needed to distinguish which of these three hypotheses is the most likely
explanation for the association between this eca <dig> locus and rln.

besides the lcorl/ncapg locus, the chromosome  <dig> and x candidate loci are
near to genes that are likely to affect muscle physiology and growth in horses
. interestingly, the primary association
signal in  <cit>  is also located in a myosin gene , a candidate gene that
may be very relevant to the pathology of a distal axonopathy like rln. yet, our
study suggests that qtls on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> identified by dupuis et
al. <cit>  are not an important influence on rln in our thoroughbred cohort. genetic
background may play an important role in a polygenic and multifactorial condition
like rln. environmental conditions are also drastically different in the actively
training racehorse  and warmblood
horses used primarily for the sports of show jumping and dressage. mean age of
animals between these two studies was also quite different. cases used here were on
average just 3 years of age versus ~8 years of age in the dupuis study . therefore, the eca <dig> locus may be most
important for development of rln in young horses in training for near maximal
athletic performance.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study add further confirmation to the association between height
and the clinical occurrence of rln and indicate the close relationship between the
genetic loci determining these two characteristics. however, despite being
statistically significant, lcorl/ncapg accounted for only 6% of the variation in
rln. however, in these thoroughbreds, the proportion of variation of rln explained
by the entire snp <dig> set  was 45%, which, although
much higher than in most complex diseases  <cit> , suggests that multimarker tests will be needed for accurate prediction
of rln risk. because of the nearly complete genetic correlation between height and
rln risk in thoroughbreds, it may be difficult reduce rln prevalence without
altering body size or other growth characteristics that may be important for racing
performance. however, our results do not preclude the possibility of modifier loci
that attenuate rln risk without reducing size or performance, or that the rln risk
allele is distinct but tightly linked to the body size locus on eca <dig>
