BACKGROUND
limb loss by regressive evolution is common in nature with well-known examples being whales, some salamanders, and snakes. amongst birds, the loss of forelimbs is best represented amongst ratites, with a general reduction in wing size evident in the rhea and ostrich, and a more severe truncation of wings shown in emu, cassowary, kiwi, and elephant bird. surprisingly, phylogenetically, new zealand’s moa group with the fully winged and flighted tinamou  <cit> , despite having lost almost all skeletal elements associated with the wing. the only evidence that moa once had wings is the presence of a small finger-sized bone, the scapulocoracoid, a fused remnant of the forelimb girdle’s coracoid and scapula .

to determine the molecular basis of winglessness in moa, we present the first reconstruction and characterization of an ancient multi-exon gene, tbx <dig>  a highly conserved tbox motif-containing transcription factor known to be essential for forelimb initiation in nearly all animals. tbx <dig> is an essential member of a tightly regulated gene network that includes the hox genes , fgf <dig> <cit> , fgf <dig> <cit> , anf  <cit> , and sall <dig> <cit> . of these, tbx <dig> is perhaps the best characterized  <cit> . knockouts of tbx <dig> in mice, or morpholino-induced tbx <dig> knockdowns in zebrafish, result in the complete loss of forelimbs  <cit> . similarly, natural occurrences of limblessness in humans and zebrafish have been attributed to mutations in tbx <dig>  in humans, most tbx <dig> mutations are found in the highly conserved dna-binding tbox region and result in holt-oram syndrome , characterized by reduction of the forelimbs and associated heart anomalies  <cit> . a similar phenotype is shown by the zebrafish tbx <dig> mutant heartstrings <cit> .

the spectrum of mutations in tbx <dig> that contribute to holt-oram syndrome continues to grow  <cit> . tbx <dig> mutations have now been found in more than 70% of patients with a strict clinical diagnosis of hos  <cit> . interestingly, a number of tbx <dig> coding sequence mutations result in relatively mild heart defects but severe forelimb abnormalities  <cit> .

as the forelimb phenotypes of mouse tbx <dig> knockouts very closely resemble the phenotype seen in moa, we reconstruct, build, and characterize moa tbx <dig> to determine the molecular basis of winglessness in this extinct ratite.

RESULTS
moa tbx <dig> construction and characterization
to amplify moa tbx <dig> sequences, primers were designed to chicken tbx <dig>  and ostrich and kiwi tbx <dig> mrna. to obtain the intron/exon boundaries we first obtained these for kiwi using a range of pcr-based methods and then designed primers to these to amplify from moa . nearly all kiwi tbx <dig> intron primers successfully amplified from moa adna. for a few intron/exon boundaries additional sequence was required from emu, cassowary, ostrich and/or rhea . moa tbx <dig> sequences were obtained as ~120 bp overlapping fragments from a number of species either by direct sequencing of pcr products or cloned material  . a complete sequence was obtained for the giant moa dinornis with additional sequence across the highly variable regions of exon  <dig>  exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig> also being obtained from megalapteryx didinus . a single interspecies polymorphic position  was detected between dinornis and m. didinus at the third base position in coding triplet  <dig> . a number of additional sequence variations were detected between moa sequences, but nearly all of these were from clones and were c > t transitions commonly the result of adna damage. no clear heterozygosity was found amongst moa tbx <dig> sequences suggesting the absence of a psuedogene . moa tbx <dig> is  <dig> amino acids long and is identical for the essential  <dig> aa dna-binding tbox region to that of chicken, ostrich, and kiwi. only two amino acids are unique to moa; an aspartic acid  > glutamic acid  change at amino acid position  <dig> and a threonine  > serine  change at amino acid position  <dig> . to verify that these amino acid changes were present on the same molecule, ‘long’ adna amplications were performed to include all the variation detected in exon  <dig>  intron - exon boundaries of moa tbx <dig> all harboured the consensus gt -ag  splice site sequences . a single intervening sequence change from the consensus g to a at position  <dig>  in dinornis tbx <dig> intron  <dig> has been shown to result in the human fibrinogen gamma gene  in either retention of the affected intron in the mrna  <cit>  or deletion of the preceding exon  <cit> . this sequence change however, is unlikely to have an effect on moa, as this splice site is highly conserved with that from tinamou.

moa tbx <dig> activates fgf <dig> and anf promoters
moa or chicken tbx <dig> in pcaggs was co-transfected into hek293t cells with fgf <dig> or anf promoter-luciferase constructs and assayed for luciferase activity. both chicken and moa tbx <dig> were able to activate the anf and fgf <dig> promoters with equal efficiency .

moa tbx <dig> induces forelimb features in chicken hindlimbs
electroporation of an rcas moa tbx <dig> construct into the presumptive hindlimb region of chicken embryos resulted in the hindlimb developing of a number of forelimb features, including reduced talon size, the production of feathers, and the phenotypic conversion of a hindlimb digit to one that more closely resembles a digit found in the wing .

determination of tbx <dig> promoter activity in moa by analysis of forelimb-specific exon  <dig> sequences
complementary dnas from ostrich and kiwi heart and forelimb, respectively, were a-tailed and 5’ nested race was carried out to isolate tbx <dig> exon  <dig> sequences . primers designed to exon  <dig> sequences obtained from forelimb tbx <dig> only amplified from ostrich or kiwi forelimb rna . primer walking using the chicken genome allowed the isolation of ~350 bp of forelimb-specific exon  <dig>  isolation of this sequence from emu, cassowary, kiwi, ostrich, rhea, tinamou, and moa shows very little difference between the ratites, with only  <dig> % difference shown between moa and rhea, thought to have diverged approximately  <dig> mya .

CONCLUSIONS
loss of flight is common in birds  <cit> . studies on pacific island rails show that flightlessness can occur rapidly with some birds becoming large and flightless within three million years  <cit> . for ratites however, it is unknown how long it took for each species to lose flight capabilities. it has been proposed that all lost their flight independently during the cretaceous tertiary  boundary approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> , a theory that challenges the vicariance biogeography model where flightless ratites are presumed to have ‘rafted’ apart with the breakup of gondwana  <cit> .

unlike the other ratites, moa have lost all elements of the forelimb skeleton, save for a finger-like bone, the scapulocoracoid, that once was part of the forelimb girdle. the scapulocoracoid consists of a short coracoid and a long tapering scapula. it is more easily identified in dinornis, anomalopteryx, and pachyornis, but was very small due to the loss of the coracoidal fossa in megalapteryx, euryapteryx, and emeus. moa do not have a glenoid fossa for articulation to the humerus  <cit> .

the timing of forelimb loss in moa is difficult to determine as a result of limited fossil material. however, by applying mutation rates to phylogenies constructed from holocene moa, it has been suggested that the last common ancestor of holocene moa lived  <dig> - <dig>  mya  <cit> . furthermore, the discovery of moa leg bones 16– <dig> mya that are morphologically very similar to those from the holocene, suggests that these moa were very similar to their later relatives and were also likely to be wingless at that time  <cit> . as the tinamou/moa split is thought to have occurred  <dig> mya  <cit> , this places the time taken for moa to develop winglessness at approximately  <dig> mya. although by no means conclusive, it is worth noting that a fossil toe bone of late cretaceous age  from new zealand’s north island may possibly be from a very large bird  <cit> .

flightlessness and forelimb loss is thought to occur by gradual deminishment as a result of changes in expression of a number of select genes. however, high conservation between the tinamou and moa forelimb-specific exon  <dig> suggests that in moa tbx <dig> continues to be expressed in the forelimb region despite possibly 16– <dig> mys of winglessness. due to the complex nature of limb development, it has been proposed that limbs can be lost but not regained  <cit> . collin and cipriani   <cit>  go on to suggest that unused genes remain in a functional state in genome for ~ <dig> my but are almost certain to lose their function at about  <dig> my. this proposal has been challenged by studies on squamates where it has been shown that lost digits at least are recoverable through evolutionary time  <cit> . one reason for this may be that the pleiotropic nature of some genes may act to keep them functional  <cit> . for example, avian teeth were lost 70– <dig> million years ago, but the avian genome still harbours the genes required for tooth formation and birds are still able to do so, as has been shown by the recovery of crocodilian-like teeth in mutant talpid

 chickens  <cit> . similarly, despite having been eyeless for over  <dig> million years, crosses between different eyeless cavefish populations have been shown to restore vision suggesting that even for complex structures such as eyes, very few loci are required for their redevelopment  <cit> .

the reasons for forelimb-specific expression of tbx <dig> in moa are unclear, but may suggest a role for tbx <dig> in maintaining the scapulocoracoid. in flighted birds the scapulocoracoid is always separated into a coracoid and scapula that collectively function to operate flight muscles important for the wing’s downward stroke. the retention of a remnant of this structure in moa for so long may well suggest that in moa the scapulocoracoid has evolved a new function. our results support observations made in mice showing that tbx <dig> is necessary for the induction of forelimbs but not sufficient for continued forelimb development  <cit> .
