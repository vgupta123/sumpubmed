BACKGROUND
schmallenberg virus  is a negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented, rna virus belonging to the bunyaviridae family, within the genus orthobunyavirus. the virus was discovered  <dig> in connection with outbreaks of diarrhoea, reduced milk production and fever in cattle in germany and the netherlands  <cit>  and has since the initial discovery rapidly spread to many european countries  <cit> . although infection is often connected with milder symptoms it can cause foetal abortions and malformations in ruminants  <cit> . sbv was the first orthobunyavirus detected in europe, but the genus consists of over  <dig> viruses grouped into  <dig> serogroups and many of these are important pathogens. in humans, this includes for example la crosse virus  causing encephalitis and ngari virus causing haermorrhagic fever  <cit> . animal pathogens, apart from sbv, includes akabane virus  and cache valley virus  that also infect ruminants and can cause abortions and congenital malformations.

the sbv genome consists of three segments  coding for four structural proteins  and two non-structural proteins . through the production of recombinant viruses lacking nss delnss), nss has been shown to be a major virulence factor for orthobunyaviruses as these deletant viruses are attenuated and show reduced growth rate compared to wild type virus  <cit> . sbv nss has also been shown to be able to counteract host antiviral responses. recombinant sbv lacking ability to express nss  is a potent inducer of type i ifn while sbv does not induce the ifn response after infection  <cit> . apart from interfering with the ifn pathway, sbv nss has also been shown to induce degradation of the rpb <dig> subunit of rna polymerase ii and to potentially have a pro-apoptotic role  <cit> . however, little is known about the overall inhibitory effects and targets of orthobunyavirus nss proteins on gene expression in infected cells. therefore, in this study we analysed the changes in the transcriptome of primary bovine cells following infection with either wild type sbv or sbvdelnss .

RESULTS
viral infection and sequencing output – quality and reference assembly
we carried out rna-seq analysis in infected and mock-infected primary bovine cells, in order to use cells with an intact cell-autonomous innate immune system. bovine primary fibroblasts were infected with either sbv, sbvdelnss or mock-infected and rna was extracted at 16 h p.i.. three biological replicates were assesses for each sample and cells were also infected in parallel for immunofluorescence  and western blot  in order to confirm that the bovine primary cells were infected by sbv and sbvdelnss at 16 h. both the sbv and the sbvdelnss infected cells were positive for the virus with an estimated infection rate at about 30%.figure  <dig> infection of sbv and sbvdelnss in bovine primary cells.  immunofluorescent detection  of sbv and sbvdelnss infected cells 16 h post infection  showed about 30% infection rate.  western blot analysis of sbv n protein and γ-tubulin at 16 h p.i.



the samples for transcriptome analysis were sequenced on illumina miseq. on average,  <dig>  million reads/sample were generated with a phred quality value of  <dig> or higher and  <dig> % of the sequence reads assembled against the bos taurus genome  using tophat <dig>  <cit> . mrna enrichment was carried out prior to sequencing and bunyaviruses in general  lack a poly-a tail in their genome and mrnas, consequently no assembly against the virus genome was performed.

differential expression analysis
cuffdiff <dig>  <cit>  was used to identify differentially expressed  genes .  <dig> de genes were identified and most were found in the sbvdelnss infected cells . hence, the majority of the de genes are as a direct or indirect result of the loss of nss. most  of the de genes affected by the loss of nss were upregulated and fold differences ranged from  <dig> -fold to the 1-fold cut-off value . the fold changes for down-regulated genes  were more subtle, ranging from  <dig> -fold to the 1-fold cut-off . the de sequence analysis was validated for  <dig> genes using sybr green realtime pcr ; the fold changes for sbvdelnss compared to the sbv infected cells were all significant  and corresponded to the sequencing data.figure  <dig> analysis of differentially expressed  genes 16 h p.i.  venn diagram of the de genes.  quantitative pcr confirmation of transcript level changes detected in the rna-seq de analysis. for all genes there is a significant statistical difference  in gene expression between sbvdelnss infection and sbv infected cells.



pathway analysis
ingenuity pathway analysis   showed that the de genes are, to a great extent, involved in pathways associated with host antiviral responses , such as type i ifn-signalling and ifn-dependent gene expression, as well as pattern recognition. this is also evident when extracting the top  <dig> most upregulated genes  as most of these have antiviral functions. the major molecules involved in viral rna recognition including ddx <dig> , trim <dig>  ifih <dig> , pkr, tlr <dig> were highly up-regulated in sbvdelnss infected cells , as are those involved in antigen presentation to cd8+ t-lymphocytes including mhc i α/β and tap 1/ <dig> . as a consequence of activation of the viral rna recognition pathways many interferon stimulated genes such oas1/ <dig>  mx <dig> and several guanylate binding proteins, were upregulated  <cit> . several interleukins were found among the de transcripts, for example il- <dig> and its downstream molecules  involved in inflammation, activation of angiogenesis and leucocyte infiltration/activation .table  <dig>

in sbv-infected cells only nine de genes  were identified  . the majority of these genes are involved in antiviral responses. all up-regulated genes in sbv infected cells, except guanine nucleotide binding protein , alpha activating activity polypeptide, olfactory type  and ribosomal protein s3a , were also upregulated following sbvdelnss infection, although to a much higher extent, indicating that nss may not be able to completely shutdown all genes of the host antiviral response. viperin  can be induced by a number of different viruses such as sindbis virus, japanese encephalitis virus and lassa fever virus  either dependently and independently of ifn  <cit> . for example, zapata jc et al.  <cit>  showed that lasv strongly induce viperin early in infection  while the attenuated ml <dig> has a weaker and delayed viperin induction suggesting that ml <dig> has a mechanism to interfere with the host-response signalling pathways. antiviral activity of rsad <dig> has been shown against for example bunv, chikungunya virus, influenza virus and dengue virus through different mechanisms such as inhibition of viral replication and budding/egress  <cit> . mx <dig> has also been shown to have antiviral activity against a number of different rna viruses such influenza and bunyaviruses  <cit> . mx <dig> is significantly upregulated in foetuses infected with cvv and it has been proposed to be involved in the clearance of the virus  <cit> . during lacv infection mx <dig> can bind to the nucleocapsid and inhibit viral replication  <cit> . also, isg <dig> is upregulated during foetal infection with cvv  <cit> . the oas proteins performs their antiviral activity through the activation of rnasel which leads to degradation of cellular and viral rna  <cit>  and oas <dig>  but not oas <dig>  is reported to contribute to a slight inhibition of bunv and bunvdelnss viruses  <cit> . hence although very few genes were up regulated during sbv infection most of the upregulated genes have all been previously shown to have antiviral activity for other similar viruses indicating that these genes, individually or collectively, may have an important role in the antiviral response and the consequent restriction of sbv infection. however, it should be noted that we only investigated host responses at one time point, and it is possible that at an earlier or later time point during the viral replication cycle, more de genes may be found, as shown for dengue virus for example  <cit> . as not all primary cells were infected by sbv or sbvdelnss it is possible that weak host responses to sbv might be masked by transcripts from uninfected cells. this may also explain why the de analysis of sbv infected cells did not show a general host transcription shutdown as described  <cit> , although mrna turnover and cell types used in this and other studies may be further reasons. only one transcript  was down-regulated in sbv infected cells compared to uninfected cells. this gene was also down-regulated in sbvdelnss-infected cells, indicating that this change is not due to the nss protein alone. this is a transcription factor that negatively regulates myogenic proteins. knockout studies of the murine homolog, inhibitory of myogenic family , have shown that lack of l-mfa can lead to embryonic lethality and placental defects as well as skeletal patterning defects  <cit> . although, the high viral levels of sbv seen in brain tissue are likely to cause the teratogenic effects seen during sbv infection the down-regulation of mdfi in sbv and sbvdelnss infected cells is potentially of interest in relation to foetal abnormalities linked to sbv infection. future studies will determine whether sbv and sbvdelinss affect expression of mdfi in fetal brain tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
we have investigated the effect of sbv infection on the host transcriptome and more specifically the effects induced by lack of nss expression. our results show the response to orthobunyavirus infection in a relevant host cell system and that nss is very efficient in shutting down the immune response of the host but that despite this a number of known antiviral proteins  are still induced during sbv infection. the data from this study serves to identify possible antiviral factors and serve as a basis for more detailed mechanistic studies of sbv and other orthobunyaviruses as well as the mechanism of action of their nss protein.
