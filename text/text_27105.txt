BACKGROUND
fertilization in angiosperms is a tale of two unions. in addition to the fertilization of the egg, which initiates the genesis of the diploid embryo, a second sperm unites with the two nuclei of the central cell to form the endosperm. the triploid nature of the endosperm renders itself a genetic dead end, but its nurturing character is evident both in anatomy and in metabolism. in most angiosperm species, early phases of embryo development proceed within an often partially "liquid" endosperm. biochemical studies have demonstrated a role of endosperm in nutrient delivery from the parental plants to the embryo  <cit> . not surprisingly, variations in the genetic constituent of the endosperm greatly impact the phenotype of seeds  <cit> . there has also been emerging evidence of cross talk between the maternal testa and the zygotic endosperm to influence seed size  <cit> . but until recently, attention on endosperm gene expression profiles has largely been focused on species in which the endosperm accumulates storage reserves. transcript profiling studies in the endosperm of corn  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and castor bean  <cit>  have been reported. an array constructed from developing arabidopsis seeds enriched for proliferating endosperm was successfully used to identify endosperm-expressed and endosperm-preferred genes  <cit> . but the development and metabolism of endosperm in exalbuminous seeds in general have not been studied intensively with modern genomics techniques.

brassica crops are among the oldest cultivated plants, with written records dating back to as early as  <dig> bc  <cit> . cultivated for its premium oil, brassica currently comprises the world's third largest oil-producing crop after soybean and oil palm. because brassica are close relatives of arabidopsis, studies targeting brassica plants directly benefit from the enormous knowledge base that is currently available in the public domain. since storage product biosynthesis takes place predominantly in the expanding cotyledon, the embryo has been a focal point of genetic and metabolic studies of seed development. consequently, several prominent regulators influencing cotyledon development and metabolism have been identified, including lec <dig>  which is involved in regulating cotyledon identity, and wrinkled <dig>  that regulates primary metabolism concerning storage lipid deposition.

in mature b. napus seeds, the endosperm is depleted to a single aleuronic layer in the mature seeds. this illustrates the dramatic cellular and biochemical shifts the endosperm undergoes during seed development. an improved understanding of the genomic landscape operating in the endosperm will facilitate both seed biology study and crop improvement efforts. in this study, we report results from an integrated analysis of developing b. napus endosperm based on ests, protein profiling and microarray datasets. we consider these efforts a first step to understanding the genomic landscape of developing endosperm and uncovering gene expression and metabolic events associated with seed traits of this important oilseed crop.

RESULTS
endosperm tissue collection and study design
similar to arabidopsis  <cit> , the development of seeds within a single silique in b. napus varies significantly in terms of developmental stages. therefore, in this study we defined the developmental phase of the endosperm based on the stages of the embedded embryos. under our growth conditions, the globular-shape embryo stage is reached approximately six days after flowering , the heart-shape embryo stage is reached after eight days, and by day  <dig> the seed enters the cotyledon stage . we collected endosperm tissues by first dissecting out the embryos, which were examined to determine the developmental stage. then, using a glass pipette with a fine tip, the endosperm was extracted and collected into pools based on whether embryo development was at the globular-shape, heart-shape or cotyledon stages . during this process, care was taken to avoid tissue from the integument, but limited contamination cannot be ruled out. amongst different sections of the endosperm, our tissue collections were enriched with micropylar endosperm surrounding the zygote . the endosperm tissue was photosynthetically active as clearly evident by the green endosperm cells shown in figure 1d. furthermore, it could also be seen that the harvested endosperm cells were laden with chloroplasts around a central vacuole . the collected tissues allowed the construction of two cdna libraries: one derived from endosperm of heart-shape embryo stage seeds and the other from endosperm of a mix of globular-shape embryo and cotyledon stage developing seeds. because the number of ests was not sufficient to justify separation into different pools, we combined the data into one endosperm database. for protein profile analysis, we focused only on endosperm in ovules containing heart-shape embryos because they exhibit all phases of endosperm development  <cit> . for microarray analysis, endosperms were harvested from seeds at the globular-shape embryo, heart-shape embryo and cotyledon stages, respectively.

endosperm est database
general description of the endosperm est dataset
we sequenced  <dig>  ests and a total of  <dig>  high quality sequences were recovered. the entire est data was deposited in dbest of ncbi under the accession numbers from es <dig> to es <dig> and ev <dig> to ev <dig>  clustering with an overlapping length of  <dig> bases, a minimum effective length of  <dig> bases and similarity at 94% yielded  <dig>  tentative contigs and  <dig>  singletons, which represent a total of  <dig>  unisequences. the average length of the unisequences was  <dig> bases .

all unisequences were subjected to search by blastx against the arabidopsis protein database at the arabidopsis information resource  for transcript homologs at an e value of less than 1e- <dig>  <cit> , and the accepted annotations had at least one high scoring pair  of minimum length  <dig> covering at least 75% of the query sequence with 80% identity. approximately  <dig> %  of the singletons and  <dig> %  of the contigs had arabidopsis homologs. among these unisequences,  <dig> %  showed similarity to proteins of hypothetical or unknown function,  <dig> %  singletons and  <dig> %  contigs had no significant similarity to any protein entries in the database. overall,  <dig> %  unisequences expressed in brassica endosperm were similar to proteins of unknown function. when the unisequences with arabidopsis homologs were subjected to functional category classification through the gene ontology  classification scheme  <cit> , 90% were classified with go annotation as involved in biological process, 92% as having molecular function and 85% as functioning as cellular components. the list of each unisequence identified and its best blastx match annotation is provided in additional file  <dig>  records of analysis for these collections can be accessed at the fiesta database developed at the plant biotechnology institute, national research council canada  <cit> .

a report on an arabidopsis est dataset from whole seeds indicated that storage proteins represent over 50% of cdnas in seed est libraries  <cit> . as a quality control measure for tissue sampling, we searched ests for storage protein genes. we found only two unisequences corresponding to storage protein genes, representing less than  <dig> % of our endosperm est libraries. this indicates that contamination from embryo tissues in our tissue sampling is negligible.

contigs of highly abundant ests
because we constructed a non-normalized cdna library, the abundance of ests from a given contig provides a relative measure of the expression level of the gene in the endosperm, albeit not in a stage-specific manner. we defined contigs derived from  <dig> or more ests as highly abundant .

the most abundant ests were from genes homologous to the arabidopsis plastocyanin-like domain-containing protein genes, including at2g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at4g <dig> and at4g <dig>  these genes, which are predicted to encode cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored proteins  <cit> , are represented by a total of  <dig> ests in our database. the encoded gene products have secretion signals and are thought to be extracellular proteins that are attached to the plasma membrane through the gpi anchor and function as mobile electron carriers. the second most abundant group of contigs encodes putative seed-specific lipid transfer proteins  capable of binding lipid molecules under certain in vitro assay conditions  <cit> . a third group of rich ests is predicted to encode a membrane galactosyltransferase , possibly involved in protein amino acid glycosylation or in reversible galactosyl transfer from galactinol to d-ononitol . based on information available from the integrated arabidopsis e-fp browser  <cit> , the arabidopsis homologs corresponding to these est groups are all highly expressed during seed development. two genes previously identified as highly expressed in castor bean endosperm  <cit> , encoding a metallothionein 2a homologous to at3g <dig> and a translationally controlled tumor protein homologous to at3g <dig>  were also among the most highly abundant in our endosperm est library.

reflecting a generally active metabolic status, ests for genes encoding major biochemical components for redox control, including glutathione s-transferase , glutathione dehydrogenase/dehydroascorbate reductase  and peroxidase , were highly represented in our est collection. consistent with abundant chloroplasts observed during our tissue collection, ests related to photosynthetic activities were also among the most frequently detected groups. when compared with the list of the most abundant contigs in the arabidopsis whole seed est dataset  <cit> , we found that nucleoside diphosphate kinase  <dig> , and myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase  were conspicuously present in the endosperm-enriched est collection, but not in the whole seed est sets. also noteworthy was the pronounced presence of ests for protein ubiquitination, including ubiquitin-protein ligases ahus <dig>  and ubc <dig>  ubiquitin  <dig>  and ubiquitin  <dig> , to which the phenotype of embryo defective  <dig> was attributed. additionally, genes encoding adp-ribosylation factor  family proteins were also highly expressed. these genes participate in multiple intracellular trafficking events and have a central role in vesicle formation during early and late secretory trafficking  <cit> . two vacuolar calcium-binding protein encoding genes , likely reflecting a key role of the endosperm in mineral storage and transfer, were also among the most abundant ests .

we were surprised to find that two genes involved in transcription activations, lec <dig> and angustifolia <dig>  <cit> , were among the most highly expressed in the endosperm. in fact, ests derived from lec <dig> was one of the top  <dig> ests in the endosperm. this will be further addressed below.

protein profile analysis
we focused on endosperm tissues harvested from seeds with heart-shape embryos for protein profile analysis. by combining one-dimensional gel electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry  and peptide mass fingerprinting , a total of  <dig> endosperm proteins were identified. the protein sequence data reported in this paper appears in the pride database under the accession number  <dig>  <cit> . a list of proteins whose functional descriptions were predicted based on their homologs from arabidopsis is provided in additional file  <dig>  protein entries were tabulated in order of high to low abundance because proteins with smaller hit numbers and larger protein scores/matches generally have higher abundance. among the identified proteins,  <dig> were products of genes encoded in the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes.

the protein profile data recapitulates some of the findings from the est datasets, as illustrated by the numbers of ests corresponding to each of the protein entries listed in additional file  <dig>  the corresponding genes of about half  of the identified proteins were represented by contigs with three or more ests. there was a sizeable presence of housekeeping components such as ribosomal proteins, proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, molecular chaperones, and translation initiation and elongation factors. the protein profiles are notably enriched for enzymes involved in carbon fixation and glycosis/gluconeogenesis. major starch and sugar metabolism enzymes, including sucrose synthase, starch synthase, hexokinase, triosephosphate isomerase, and several subunits of the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, were all detected. other prominent biochemical pathways whose enzymes were highly represented in the profiles include the tricarboxylic acid  cycle, redox homeostasis, and nucleotide sugar metabolism. we observed several enzymes involved in inositol phosphate biosynthesis, the metabolic branch concerning methionine synthesis and one carbon cycle metabolism. these results are all consistent with the est dataset.

concerning cellular events, there was an apparent enrichment for proteasome components, as well as biochemical machinery for protein ubiquitination, suggesting a high demand for protein turnover during endosperm development. in addition, we found many coatomer proteins, which are the principle components of the coat protein complex involved in endoplasmic reticulum-to-golgi vesicle-mediated transport. a putative cell division cycle protein  <dig>  involved in membrane trafficking  <cit>  was also found. it was also significant that our protein profile detected the homolog of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase, the expression of which was revealed in our est analysis. the fact that we detected the expression of this gene in both approaches suggests that it may play a significant role in endosperm development, likely in membrane lipid turnover  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that we saw multiple isoforms of subtilase  family proteins  <cit> . it has been reported in arabidopsis that some subtilisin-like protease genes are strictly expressed in the micropylar endosperm surrounding the embryo and are important for the cuticle development of the embryo  <cit> . we were also interested in looking for metabolite transporters that are potentially involved in nutrient trafficking. only one integral membrane protein similar to an arabidopsis sugar transporter erd6-like  <dig>  was found. this putative sugar transporter is located in the vacuolar membrane and is possibly involved in transporting sugars out of the vacuole under certain conditions.

microarray analysis
general description of microarray data
an in-house cdna array system was used in this study . the system consists of  <dig>  amplicons of unisequences derived from cdna libraries from several developmental stages of brassica. this platform was deposited in gene expression omnibus  database, under accession number gpl <dig>  the quality of the array was previously evaluated with different rna sources  <cit> . approximately 55% of the unisequences in our endosperm est dataset were covered in this cdna array. two-color labeled cdnas from endosperm at three embryo developing stages including globular-shape embryo, heart-shape embryo and cotyledon were used for pairwise comparisons. two biological repeats and four technical repeats with color-swap hybridizations in each comparison were performed. details could be accessed in gene expression omnibus with accession number gse <dig>  <cit> . the reproducibility of the microarray hybridization and data quality were assessed through correlation analyses and rt-pcr. the correlation coefficient between duplicate spots within an array ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and the correlation coefficient of the signal ratio for each tissue pair between technical repeats with same color labeling varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . furthermore,  <dig> unisequences were selected and subjected to rt-pcr. the expression levels of these genes covered a wide spectrum, thereby allowing us to compare the resolution and relative accuracy of microarray data. there is good correspondence  between the rt-pcr log <dig> ratio and the microarray log <dig> ratio . these results confirmed the overall reliability of the microarray expression data.

the microarray data were normalized and went through rigorous preprocessing and filtering . using rank product  <cit>  we identified  <dig>  unisequences that were significantly differentially expressed during endosperm development . twenty-four clusters were identified using a pattern-based clustering technique  <cit>  . clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  are two major clusters that collectively include 63% of all differentially expressed unisequences. their patterns of change are mirror images of each another. the distribution of go annotation in biological process for each cluster was calculated .

identification of developmental stage favored genes
certain embryo stage favored groups can be identified from the clusters as detailed in additional file  <dig>  the  <dig> clusters can be grouped into four classes: globular-shape embryo stage favored, heart-shape embryo stage favored, cotyledon stage favored, and others that do not fall into any of the above groups . in general, differential expression was most evident at early stages of endosperm development between the globular-shape and heart-shape embryo and the globular-shape embryo and cotyledon stages. the difference in gene expression between heart-shape embryo and cotyledon stages was not as obvious.

genes of the globular-shape embryo stage favored class, which include clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  show peak expression at the globular-shape embryo stage. most genes involved in photosynthesis, such as light-harvesting complex proteins and chlorophyll-binding proteins, were among this group. a significant number of genes  in this class still have unknown functions.

clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> constitute the heart-shape embryo stage favored class. genes in these clusters showed an increase in transcript level from globular-shape embryo to heart-shape embryo stages, whereas the transcript level in endosperm at the cotyledon stage was generally lower than that at the heart-shape embryo stage. this group includes genes for biochemical machineries of protein turnover, such as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  <dig> , ubiquitin  <dig> , cysteine proteinase, and heat shock proteins such as hsp70b, hsp <dig>  and dnaj. genes encoding pectinesterase family proteins  and cellulose synthase  also reached high expression levels in endosperm at the heart-shape embryo and cotyledon stages. similarly, four genes encoding cellulose synthase  and α- <dig> -glucan-protein synthase  were up-regulated at this particular stage. we also identified two genes encoding auxin-responsive proteins and one for gibberellin 20-oxidase, whose expression levels increased from the heart-shape embryo to the cotyledon stages. the up-regulation of these genes suggests that these plant growth regulators may play a key role in regulating endosperm development at the heart-shape embryo stage.

the cotyledon stage favored class encompasses clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which reached their peak expression levels at the cotyledon stage. most prominent in this group are transcription factors, some of which are known to play a role in cotyledon development and storage product synthesis. these include lec <dig> , basic leucine zipper  <dig> , high mobility group at-hook  and wri <dig> , which were up-regulated by  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold. genes for myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase  and the starch degradation enzymes, α-amylase  and β-amylase , also gradually increased their expression level at this stage.

nine clusters do not seem to peak at any particular developmental stage and therefore do not fall into any of the above groups. cluster  <dig>  by far the largest cluster, contains  <dig> unisequences that show rapid transcript accumulation from the globular-shape embryo to the heart-shape embryo stage, but only minor changes between the heart-shape embryo and cotyledon stages. this cluster includes genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, such as 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase , pyruvate dehydrogenase , acyl- desaturase  and β-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase . several genes that were represented by the most abundant ests in our endosperm est dataset, including those in the lipid transfer protein  family  and the putative plastocyanin-like domain-containing proteins , also exhibited enhanced expression levels from the globular-shape embryo to the heart-shape embryo and cotyledon stages.

identification of commonly expressed genes
to identify genes that are commonly expressed across the three endosperm developmental stages, genes with expression signal values of  <dig> or higher across the three stages were selected. we identified a total of  <dig> unisequences . in this group,  <dig> unisequences have similar expression levels across the three stages. the majority  of this group of unisequences have at least one identified est. a significant number of unisequences are involved in the chloroplast, ribosome, mitochondrion and other subcellular components.

integrative analysis
featured metabolic pathways in endosperm
based on est, protein profile and microarray data, we performed integrated data mining to uncover signature embolic pathways in the endosperm. the unisequences from the cdna library and microarray and the protein entries identified by protein profile were searched against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  enzyme database  <cit>  and the tair pathway database  <cit> . these searches identified  <dig> unigenes matching  <dig> enzymes  in our library. the protein profile analysis produced  <dig> enzymes, which corresponded to  <dig> unigenes. the microarray detected a total of  <dig> enzymes  among the significantly differentially expressed unisequences . combining all three datasets, several prominent metabolic processes in the endosperm emerged. these processes are discussed separately below.

active starch metabolism status in endosperm
both the est dataset and the protein profile analysis revealed an abundant presence of photoassimilation machinery in the endosperm. when examined via microarray, we found a consistent trend of decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes during endosperm development. the highest level of expression was at a phase when the endosperm accompanied the globular-shape embryo stage embryo. in keeping with the large number of starch granules present in the tissue collection, we observed genes and gene products for enzymes required for starch synthesis and starch degradation. a rate-limiting step for starch biosynthesis is mediated by adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , which is composed of tetramers of small  and large subunits . as shown in figure  <dig>  a gene for aps , which encodes the regulatory subunit of agpase, displayed increased expression at the heart-shape embryo and cotyledon developmental stages. a similar trend was also found for an agpase large subunit gene . likewise, another important component of the starch biosynthesis system, starch branching enzyme , displayed increased expression during endosperm development. when we looked into the expression profiles of starch degradation enzyme genes, e.g., α-amylase  and β-amylase , we also observed an increase in expression as endosperm development proceeded . these results suggest that there is an active metabolic flux from photoassimilation to primary carbon metabolism in the endosperm.

sugar metabolism in endosperm
the channeling of sucrose and its conversion to hexose are pivotal metabolic events in the endosperm. these processes concern not only carbon supply but also osmotic regulation in the endosperm  <cit> . cleavage of sucrose to hexoses can occur through two routes, mediated either by sucrose synthase  or by invertase. several ests for susy genes were present. susy isoforms were also detected in our protein profile analysis, which is consistent with a recent report on the immunolocalization of susy in the arabidopsis endosperm  <cit> . the expression profile of susy was categorized under cluster  <dig> in our microarray data, where its expression at the heart-shape embryo stage was twice as high as the expression at either the preceding or later developmental stages. it was recently reported that in the liquid fraction of early seed development, hexose reaches its highest level at  <dig> days after anthesis  and declines afterwards  <cit> . it is important to note that at  <dig> daa the seed also reaches its optimum size due to the presence of large vacuoles, which are sustained by accumulation of osmoticum, such as hexose. within this context, it is tempting to speculate that the expression of susy in the endosperm contributes to the temporal accumulation of hexose, thereby having some relation to seed size regulation. susy genes are also highly expressed in the developing embryo, but their expression continues to increase after accumulation of storage products in the cotyledon  <cit> .

in addition to susy, invertase activity was reported as being particularly high in the endosperm  <cit> . surprisingly, however, we failed to detect invertase in either the ests or the protein profile datasets. our microarray did include two unisequences corresponding to cytosolic invertases. however, the signal from those unisequences was very low in comparison to the signal for susy.

with regard to general carbon metabolism, it is worth noting that ests corresponding to the homolog of arabidopsis snf1-related kinase  <dig>  , also known as cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig>  were frequently detected, making it the most abundant protein kinase in the endosperm est dataset. the expression of this protein kinase gene falls into cluster  <dig> of the microarray data. the highest level was reached at the heart-shape embryo stage and declined at the cotyledon stage. the snrk3s have an n-terminal catalytic domain similar to that of the yeast snf <dig> kinase and also interact with calcium-binding protein calcineurin. like snf <dig> in yeast, snrks in crop plants have frequently been implicated in metabolic regulation in response to nutritional and stress signals  <cit> .

endosperm contains inositol phosphate and phytate metabolism
phytate  is the most abundant myo-inositol phosphate  in plant cells. it serves as a storage form of myo-inositol, providing phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth  <cit> . it is also one of the undesirable constituents in brassica seeds, and its accumulation is known to take place in arabidopsis endosperm  <cit> . there are at least two major routes of phytate biosynthesis: a lipid-dependent route that uses insp <dig> produced from phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -biphosphate by phospholipase c , and a lipid-independent route relying on the phosphorylation of myo-inositol or insp  <cit> . in the lipid-independent pathway, insp <dig> can be obtained from the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate, catalyzed by myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase , which is the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of all inositol-containing compounds. the est dataset contained  <dig> est members encoding mips. multiple isoforms of the mips proteins were also found in our protein profile analysis, consistent with the detection of this enzyme in the endosperm through immunoelectron microscopy  <cit> . we also observed expression of other genes in the same pathway, including inositol polyphosphate multikinase  and 1d-myo-inositol tetrakisphosphate 5-kinase, which phosphorylates insp <dig>  when examined via microarray, expression of the mips gene exhibited a drastic and continual increase from the globular-shape embryo stage to the cotyledon stage  . these results extends the observations of otegui et al  <cit>  and mitsuhashi et al  <cit>  and suggest that metabolic engineering efforts aimed at reducing phytate content in brassica must consider endosperm metabolism and development.

endosperm contains various enzymes for methyl recycling activities
our integrated data mining also revealed robust methyl recycling metabolic activities in the endosperm. utilization of the methyl group of s-adenosyl-methionine  is coupled by recycling of the homocysteinyl moiety and regeneration of methionine. sam-dependent methylation events are involved in many essential metabolic processes, including chromatin modification, transcript capping, phospholipid biosynthesis and lignification of the cell wall  <cit> . an entire set of methylation cycle enzyme genes was previously described in barley endosperm  <cit> . significantly, three major components of the methylation cycle, a cytosolic methionine synthase , the s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase  and s- adenosylmethionine synthetase , were highly expressed based on both the number of ests and the microarray data. in keeping with the est data, sahh <dig> and methionine synthase were also detected in our protein profile analysis. microarray data, on the other hand, show that the expression of these genes did not follow the same pattern. methionine synthase gene expression was consistently at a high level and did not fluctuate during the different developmental phases. sahh <dig> expression was induced at the heart-shape embryo stage and slightly increased afterwards. the expression of the methionine adenosyltransferase was highest at the heart-shape embryo stage.

it was noteworthy that ests corresponding to adenosine kinase  <dig>  were also detected, although there were only three ests. the presence of adk was further substantiated by its detection in the protein profile. the combined activities of adk and sahh <dig> are essential for generating lignin precursors. within this context, it is interesting that the expression of adk <dig> was in a similar pattern when compared with that of sahh <dig>  it has previously been reported that in the seed coat, sahh was highly expressed, but adk was hardly detectable  <cit> . thus, assuming that metabolite trafficking occurs between the endosperm and the integument, the absence of adk would allow speculation that the lignin precursors for the seed coat are generated from the adjacent endosperm. earlier observation indicated that at least in castor bean, the adenosine generated through the salvage pathway by adk is mobilized from the endosperm to the developing cotyledon  <cit> 

transcription factors  in endosperm
a search against the database of arabidopsis transcription factors   <cit>  identified  <dig> tfs in the est collection, which can be classified into  <dig> families . the details are displayed in additional file  <dig>  the largest group, with  <dig> ests corresponding to  <dig> unigenes, consists of tfs containing ccaat-box-related motifs, to which lec <dig> belongs. in this group, a homolog of hap5c  was detected through protein profile analysis. other abundant transcription factor genes expressed in the endosperm include those in the ap2-erebp family. wri <dig>  <cit>  is a member of this group.

note: in our endosperm cdna library,  <dig>  unique sequences  were subjected to blastn against tair at <e- <dig>   <dig>  unisequences can match arabidopsis agi identifiers. these agis represent  <dig>  unigenes. among these unigenes,  <dig> encode transcription factors. these tfs could be classified into  <dig> families according to the categroies of the website . the detail of each family was displayed as additional file  <dig> 

abundance of lec <dig> during endosperm development
lec <dig> was represented by  <dig> ests in our est library and was highly expressed across the three embryo stages based on microarray data . similarly, we found another transcription factor, wri <dig>  to be highly represented by ests. wri <dig> expression progressively increased during endosperm development and was highest at the cotyledon stage . it has been established that wri <dig> regulates the expression of several lipid biosynthesis genes. the presence of the lec <dig> transcript in the endosperm of arabidopsis was previously documented by in situ hybridization  <cit> . nonetheless, the transcript could originate in the cotyledon if it is mobile between the endosperm and the embryo. we thus examined the promoter activity of lec <dig> using a gus reporter fusion in arabidopsis. we assumed that the promoter activity of its arabidopsis ortholog should serve as valid references and thus conducted experiments using the promoters of the arabidopsis lec <dig> in arabidopsis transgenic plants. as shown in figure 7a, lec <dig> promoter activities were first detected in the embryo suspensor at the early globular-shape embryo stage. at the heart-shape embryo and cotyledon stages, lec <dig> promoter activities were observed throughout the endosperm as well as the entire embryo . this is consistent with in situ hybridization results reported previously  <cit>  and in line with the results of our microarray analysis . to comparatively assess the transcript levels of lec <dig> in the embryo and endosperm of b. napus, we performed rt-pcr with rna samples from endosperm and embryos at the cotyledon stage. our results show that lec <dig> transcript levels were higher in the endosperm than in the embryo , suggesting that the expression of lec <dig> is robust in the endosperm at this stage.

lec <dig> regulatory cascade in the endosperm
intrigued by the finding that a transcription factor required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation is so abundant in the transcriptome of endosperm  <cit> , we decided to look into the expression of downstream targets of lec <dig> in the endosperm. lec <dig> is a master transcription factor that regulates several other key transcription factors, such as lec <dig>  fusca <dig> , abscisic acid insensitive  <dig>  and abi <dig>  <cit> . lec <dig> also regulates wri <dig>  either directly or indirectly via lec <dig>  the microarray data show that expression of lec <dig> progressively increases from the globular-shape embryo stage to the heart-shape embryo stage and then to the cotyledon stage. wri <dig> follows the same trend . however, the level of mrna from lec <dig> is one order of magnitude higher than that of wri <dig>  which is consistent with the est dataset. lec <dig> is not in our microarray. lec <dig> itself is subjected to negative regulation by pickle   <cit> , and there is a detectable but very limited level of pkl gene expression across the three embryo stages. fus <dig>  abi <dig> and abi <dig> did not have a detectable level of mrna in our microarray data. but one of the regulatory roles of lec <dig> via fus <dig> is the induction of a gene  encoding an aspartyl protease family protein  <cit> . indeed, microarray data indicated that a substantial amount of mrna from this gene was present across the three stages, suggesting that the fus <dig> regulatory cascade operates in the endosperm.

the associated expression pattern of lec <dig> and wri <dig> provided impetus to further examine the target genes of wri <dig>  ruuska et al.  <cit>  investigated gene expression in the seed of the arabidopsis mutant wri <dig> and found  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the wild type and the wri <dig> mutant. they categorized the genes into four groups: genes associated with fatty acid metabolism, genes associated with carbon metabolism, miscellaneous genes and genes up-regulated in the mutant. our microarray data show that the expression profiles of their orthologs in brassica endosperm exhibit a pattern similar to what would be expected of a wri <dig> regulatory network, except for the photosynthesis-related genes . ruuska et al.  <cit>  reported that photosystem ii chlorophyll-binding genes were down-regulated in the arabidopsis wri mutant, suggesting that wri <dig> was a positive regulator of these genes. during endosperm development, however, photosynthesis-related gene expression exhibited a downward trend after the globular-shape embryo stage, and thus there was a negative correlation with the wri <dig> transcript level. based on the information gained from this study and existing literature  <cit> , we envision a small regulatory network in which both lec <dig> and wri <dig> are involved in the endosperm . the presence of such a regulatory network is at least consistent with regard to the synthesis of storage lipids, which were shown to accumulate to a significant amount in the endosperm of brassica napus and arabidopsis  <cit> . this merits further study.

CONCLUSIONS
we reported the first comprehensive survey of the endosperm gene expression profile in a major oilseed crop. the datasets presented in this work portray a gene expression landscape that is complicated in structure but coordinated in regulation. we also provide insight into several prominent metabolic pathways in the endosperm that have implications for improving the productivity and quality of canola. our findings on the endosperm expression of lec <dig> and other transcription factors involved in regulating storage product biosynthesis in the cotyledon provide impetus for further investigation into the role of endosperm in controlling embryo development and storage product deposition.
