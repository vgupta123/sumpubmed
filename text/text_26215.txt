BACKGROUND
infectious diseases have devastating ecological and economical impacts on fish, amphibian and reptile populations worldwide . despite those effects, the precise pathogenesis of infectious diseases of ectotherm vertebrates and the interaction with the immune system of their respective hosts are mostly poorly understood. recently, marked progress has been made in the characterization of the immune system of lower vertebrates. this has been facilitated by concentrated focus on the cloning of pathogen-induced genes and by accumulating sequence data from genome and expressed sequence tag  projects. similarly, increased information about the genomes of pathogens of lower vertebrates is becoming available. however, there are still large gaps in our knowledge, especially concerning the interaction of ectothermic pathogens with the host immune system.

ranaviruses, which constitute a genus within the family iridoviridae, are important pathogens of ectotherms and have been associated with massive die-offs of both wild and farmed populations of fish, frogs and salamanders in diverse areas of the world  <cit> . ranaviruses are double-stranded dna viruses with genomes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. currently the genomes of seven ranaviruses have been sequenced: ambystoma tigrinum virus ; frog virus  <dig> ; tiger frog virus ; grouper iridovirus ; soft-shelled turtle iridovirus ; and epizootic hematopoietic necrosis virus . phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of two major clades among ranaviruses, one that included giv and sgiv, and another comprised of atv, ehnv, fv <dig>  stiv and tfv. interestingly, the latter clade could be further subdivided with atv and ehnv in one subclade, and fv <dig>  stiv and tfv in the other. the diversity of organisms  infected by viruses from this second clade, combined with short branch lengths within its two subclades may indicate recent host switches among ranaviruses  <cit> . however, it should be noted that the host range of ranaviruses is incompletely understood at this time.

the host immune system has evolved multiple ways to fight virus infection and replication. one important arm of the host immune response is the innate immune system, which recognizes molecular patterns present in many pathogens and initiates antimicrobial responses  <cit> . an important component of the host response is the antiviral protein kinase pkr, which contains double-stranded  rna binding domains  and a kinase domain. pkr is activated by dsrna, which is formed during infection by many rna and dna viruses, and phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> . pkr is inactive in its latent monomeric form. however, upon binding dsrna, two pkr molecules dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation on residue thr <dig>   <cit> . activated pkr then phosphorylates eif2α on ser <dig>  which subsequently acts as an inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eif2b. as eif2b normally exchanges gdp for gtp on eif <dig>  a step necessary for successful translation initiation, eif2α phosphorylation leads to a general inhibition of translation initiation  <cit> . the function of mammalian pkr and its interaction with viruses has been extensively characterized . however, pkr-like molecules in ectotherms eluded molecular characterization until recently. pkr-like activity was first described in fish cells  <cit> . this was followed by the cloning and functional characterization of crucian carp and zebrafish pkr-related genes, which contain z-dna binding  domains instead of the dsrbds and were hence named pkz  <cit> . pkz was subsequently described in atlantic salmon and the rare minnow  <cit> . recently, authentic pkr genes were described and characterized in many ectotherm species including zebrafish, pufferfish, japanese flounder and two xenopus species  <cit> . like mammalian pkr, both pkz and pkr are induced by immunostimulation  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses indicate that a duplication of an ancestral pkr-like gene in the fish lineage probably led to the emergence of pkr and pkz in a fish ancestor, and might have helped to extend the spectrum of viral nucleic acids that can be recognized  <cit> . although higher vertebrates lack pkz genes, they contain a different zα-containing protein, termed zbp <dig>  which binds z-dna and has been implicated in the recognition of viral dna and the induction of an antiviral response  <cit> .

in order to overcome the antiviral effects of pkr many mammalian viruses encode inhibitors of pkr, which block pkr activation or activity at different steps during or following the activation process . many poxviruses possess two pkr inhibitors, which are designated e <dig> and k <dig> in vaccinia virus  and are encoded by the e3l and k3l genes, respectively. e <dig> binds to dsrna and prevents activation of pkr  <cit> , whereas k <dig> encodes an s <dig> domain that is homologous to the n-terminus of eif2α and inhibits activated pkr by binding to the kinase domain and acting as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of pkr  <cit> .

interestingly, most ranaviruses encode a protein with an s <dig> domain, which is related to the s <dig> domain of eif2α and k <dig> and is referred to as a viral homolog of eif2α or vif2α. in contrast to k <dig>  which only possesses the s <dig> domain, vif2α proteins contain a c-terminal extension of between  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, for which no sequence homology to any other proteins was described. it was previously speculated that vif2α in analogy to k <dig> might be an inhibitor of pkr and might therefore play an important role in the pathogenesis of ranaviruses  <cit> . herein, using a heterologous yeast assay system, we describe the characterization of vif2α as an inhibitor of human and zebrafish pkr.

RESULTS
we present three lines of evidence that the c-terminus of vif2α is actually homologous to the helical and parts of the c-terminal domains of eif2α. firstly, we performed psi-blast searches with vif2α from atv and rcv-z. during the first iteration, sequence similarity for regions spanning amino acids 5- <dig> of atv-vif2α with the s <dig> and helical domains eif2α from multiple eukaryotes was noted. during the second iteration, this region of similarity to eif2α was extended to amino acid position  <dig> of vif2α. secondly, multiple sequence alignments including vif2α from many ranaviruses and eif2α from a diverse set of eukaryotes showed conservation of amino acids outside the s <dig> domain:  <dig> amino acids are 100% conserved among the sequences . moreover, conservative amino acid differences are present at  <dig> positions outside the s <dig> domain . at many other positions, amino acids that are identical to the ones found in vif2α are present in a subset of eif2α sequences . while the multiple sequence alignment reveals sequence homology between vif2α and eif2α throughout the reading frame, sequence similarity is highest within the s <dig> domain, with the highest levels of sequence identity surrounding strands β <dig> and β <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . interestingly, in vacv k <dig> this region was previously shown to be important for pkr inhibition  <cit> . thirdly, secondary structure prediction with atv and rcv-z vif2α resulted in predicted β-sheets and α-helices that coincide very well with the solved structural features observed in the nmr structure of human eif2α  <cit> . these observations indicate that the middle and c-terminal parts of vif2α are homologous to the helical and c-terminal domains, respectively, of eif2α.

yeast-based assays were previously employed to characterize pkr and its interaction with viral inhibitors  <cit> . to test whether vif2α can inhibit pkr-mediated toxicity in yeast, we transformed a control strain and a strain expressing human pkr under the control of the galactose-regulated gal-cyc <dig> hybrid promoter with plasmids designed to express rcv-z vif2α and vacv k3l also under control of the gal-cyc <dig> promoter. when grown under inducing conditions , comparable growth was seen in the control strain transformed with vector, k3l or vif2α, demonstrating that k <dig> and vif2α had no effect on yeast cell growth . in contrast, induction of pkr expression was toxic in the vector-transformed yeast, whereas the toxicity was suppressed by co-expression of k3l or vif2α .

based on the homology of vif2α with eif2α throughout the entire orf we tested whether suppression of pkr toxicity might be caused by the complementation of eif2α function by vif2α. to this end, we transformed a yeast strain that carries a temperature-sensitive mutant of eif2α   <cit>  with an empty vector, with a plasmid designed to express wild-type eif2α  under the control of its native promoter, or with the plasmids that express vif2α or k3l under the control of the galactose regulated gal-cyc <dig> promoter. yeast transformants were streaked on synthetic complete medium containing galactose  and incubated at different temperatures. at permissive temperatures  all transformants grew well . however, when incubated at restrictive temperatures , only wild type eif2α was able to rescue growth . it is important to note that under these growth conditions vif2α and k3l were able to suppress pkr toxicity , indicating that the viral proteins are functional under these conditions. as expression of neither vif2α nor k3l suppressed the growth defects of the sui2- <dig> mutant strain, we conclude that vif2α does not functionally substitute for eif2α.

we next compared the effect of vif2α on human and zebrafish pkr with the effects of the two vacv pkr inhibitors k <dig> and e <dig>  in the control strain not expressing pkr, expression of k3l or vif2α had no effect on yeast cell growth, whereas expression of e3l induced a slow growth phenotype as previously described  <cit>  . the toxicity associated with expression of human pkr was inhibited by co-expression of k3l, vif2α or e3l . interestingly, the toxicity associated with expression of zebrafish pkr in yeast was only inhibited by vif2α or e3l, but not by k3l . thus in accord with the virus host range vif2α, but not vacv k3l, may have evolved to inhibit fish pkr. to assess the effectiveness of k <dig>  e <dig>  and vif2α to inhibit human and zebrafish pkr, matching sets of strains expressing a particular inhibitor and either no pkr, human pkr, or zebrafish pkr were streaked on the same plate for comparison. examining the colony sizes of the transformants in the streaks revealed that k <dig> did not fully inhibit human pkr . in contrast, vif2α and e <dig> appeared to fully inhibit both human and zebrafish pkr .

suppression of pkr toxicity in yeast could be due to impaired pkr expression or due to inhibition of eif2α phosphorylation. in order to examine eif2α phosphorylation, yeast whole cell extracts were prepared by the tca method to prevent protein degradation and dephosphorylation, and western blot analyses were performed using phospho-specific antibodies directed against phospho-ser <dig> in eif2α. to normalize for protein loading, the blot was then stripped and probed with anti-yeast eif2α antiserum. as shown in figure 4d , induction of either human or zebrafish pkr expression in the absence of a viral inhibitor led to high levels of eif2α phosphorylation. co-expression of k3l, vif2α, or e3l greatly reduced eif2α phosphorylation in cells expressing human pkr . consistent with the growth assays, vif2α and e <dig>  but not k <dig>  inhibited eif2α phosphorylation in yeast expressing zebrafish pkr. next, pkr expression levels were monitored using an anti-flag tag antibody. expression levels of pkr were higher in the presence of effective eif2α phosphorylation inhibitors. as observed previously pkr autoinhibits its own expression in yeast  <cit> . presumably pkr phosphorylation of eif2α leads to suppression of total protein synthesis including pkr expression. accordingly, inhibition of pkr by the viral inhibitors restores protein synthesis and leads to higher pkr levels. taken together, the results of the pkr expression and eif2α phosphorylation studies demonstrate that vif2α can effectively inhibit eif2α phosphorylation by human and zebrafish pkr.

in the presence of effective eif2α phosphorylation inhibitors, pkr migrated faster on sds-page than in the controls . this might have been caused by inhibition of pkr autophosphorylation. to examine pkr autophosphorylation, we probed the western blots with a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes human pkr phosphorylated on thr <dig>  high levels of thr <dig> phosphorylation were detected in the absence of inhibitors and when either k <dig> or vif2α were present. thr <dig> phosphorylation was effectively inhibited in the presence of e <dig> . these results indicate that k <dig> and vif2α are unable to block thr <dig> phosphorylation and are consistent with previous findings that k <dig> binding to pkr is dependent on thr <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . presumably vif2α, like k <dig>  binds to pkr following autophosphorylation on thr <dig> and blocks subsequent autophosphorylation events that lead to altered mobility of pkr on sds-page. zebrafish pkr was not detected with the antibody directed against thr446-phosphorylated human pkr . this was expected because of the strong sequence divergence between human and zebrafish pkr surrounding the phosphorylation site  <cit> . finally, using yeast growth rate assays as described above, vif2α was found to inhibit, at least partially, both xenopus laevis pkr <dig> and zebrafish pkz . however, precise determination of pkr <dig> and pkz sensitivity to vif2α inhibition will depend on the ability to obtain yeast strains expressing the appropriate level of each kinase.

in order to test which domains of vif2α are important for pkr inhibition we tested various vif2α deletion mutants for their ability to inhibit pkr activity. additionally, the c-terminus of rcv-z vif2α was extended to match the length of atv vif2α . for the latter constructs, the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids found in atv vif2α that are not in rcv-z vif2α due to an early termination codon were appended to the c-terminus of rcv-z vif2α . none of the vif2α constructs led to a growth defect in the control strain not expressing pkr . in a zebrafish pkr-expressing strain, wild-type vif2α, vif2α+26c, and vif2αΔ59c  led to comparable inhibition of pkr toxicity . in contrast, no pkr suppression was observed when the helical domain was partly  or completely  deleted or when the n-terminus was deleted  . western analyses of eif2α phosphorylation in the strains expressing zebrafish pkr and the various vif2α mutants revealed that vif2α, vif2α+26c, vif2α59c led to strong and comparable inhibition of eif2α phosphorylation . consistent with their inability to inhibit pkr toxicity in yeast, high levels of eif2α phosphorylation were observed in strains expressing the other vif2α mutants . as seen earlier, pkr was expressed at higher levels and migrated faster on sds-page when pkr toxicity and eif2α phosphorylation were suppressed . western blot analyses using antibodies against a c-terminal myc-epitope tag in the vif2α constructs revealed detectable expression for only vif2α, vif2α+26c, and vif2α59c. comparable results were obtained in western blot analyses of protein extracts from the control  strain expressing these same vif2α mutants , indicating that both the s <dig> domain and the helical domain are essential for vif2α expression and/or stability.

discussion
ranaviruses are important pathogens of fish, amphibians and reptiles . however, little is known about how they interact with the immune system of their hosts. herein we show that rcv-z vif2α, a homolog of eif2α, is an effective inhibitor of pkr in a heterologous yeast assay system. pkr is an important antiviral protein kinase that has been primarily studied in mammals . pkr-related genes have recently been identified in a variety of fish and amphibian species. fish pkr genes are expressed at low levels constitutively, but they are highly induced after viral infection and stimulation with the dsrna analog poly, which mimics viral infection  <cit> . it was recently shown that pkr of the japanese flounder  was able to inhibit replication of scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus  <cit> . to date, only pkr inhibitors from mammalian viruses have been functionally characterized . moreover, the only well-characterized viral pkr inhibitors that directly target the pkr kinase domain are the pseudosubstrates found in many poxviruses and represented by vacv k3l, which is homologous to the s <dig> domain of the pkr target eif2α  <cit> . it was speculated that the ranavirus vif2α protein, another eif2α homolog, might inhibit pkr of infected hosts  <cit> . a notable difference between k <dig> and eif2α is the presence of an extended c-terminal domain in eif2α. in addition to the c-terminal α/β domain, eif2α consists of an n-terminal s <dig> domain and a central α-helical domain. the k <dig> protein is homologous to the n-terminal domain in eif2α. like k <dig>  vif2α shows moderate sequence identity to eif2α in the s <dig> domain. in this study we used psi-blast analyses, multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction to show that the c-terminal parts of vif2α are likewise homologous to the helical and c-terminal domains of eif2α.

functional analyses using deletion constructs of vif2α revealed that both the s <dig> and helical domains are sufficient for inhibition of pkr in yeast . since the presence of both domains was necessary for detectable vif2α expression, it appears possible that the domains are important to stabilize each other. the crystal structure of human eif2α showed that the s <dig> and helical domains are connected by an intramolecular disulfide bridge formed by cysteine residues  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, a cysteine corresponding to position  <dig> is found in many metazoa, including chordata, echinodermata, cnidaria and mollusca, but is missing in most arthropoda , in all fungi and plants sequences currently found in genbank, and in all poxviral k3l orthologs . as cysteines corresponding to residues  <dig> and  <dig> in human eif2α are found in all vif2α sequences , we speculate that formation of a disulfide bridge between the two domains might be important for the stability of vif2α. future in vitro kinase assays with vif2α constructs that are produced in a cell-free translation system might be suited to further investigate the importance of the individual domains.

it is striking that eif2α sequences and all known vif2α sequences display a high level of sequence identity within their respective groups. the sequence identity for eif2α is between 92% and 100% among vertebrates, while the sequence identity for vif2α is between 95% and 98% among ranaviruses. in contrast, k3l orthologs are very diverse, some of which display only around 30-40% sequence identity to each other  <cit> . the high sequence conservation in eif2α and vif2α indicates that eif2α might be under purifying  selective pressure in order to maintain its primary sequence or, alternatively, that current ranaviruses might have experienced bottlenecks in their recent evolution. overall the s <dig> domains of vif2α and k <dig> are comparably distantly related to eif2α.

interestingly, some ranaviruses do not encode functional vif2α orthologs. giv and sgiv do not contain vif2α orthologs, and truncated vif2α genes lacking regions of the n-terminal and the helical domains are found in the completely sequenced fv <dig> strain and in stiv  <cit> . as our studies indicate that the n-terminus of vif2α is essential for pkr inhibition, these complete or partial deletions might lead to the attenuation of the viruses. in accord with this notion fv <dig>  which lacks most of vif2α, is much less pathogenic than rcv-z in north american bullfrog  tadpoles  <cit> . alternatively the absence of predicted functional vif2α proteins in some ranaviruses suggests that, as in vaccinia virus, a second pkr inhibitor may be present in ranaviruses.

western blot analyses showed that human pkr was expressed at higher levels in yeast expressing the pkr inhibitors vif2α, k3l, or e3l, consistent with the notion that the viral inhibitors suppress autoinhibition of pkr expression. moreover, pkr from cells expressing viral inhibitors migrated faster on sds-page, suggesting that the inhibitors might block pkr autophosphorylation. thr <dig> is the only site in the human pkr kinase domain that is stoichiometrically phosphorylated and visible in the pkr crystal structure, where it is thought to stabilize the active pkr conformation  <cit> . once activated, pkr can phosphorylate eif2α as well as autophosphorylate other residues in the kinase  <cit> ; however the significance of the latter is not fully understood. interestingly, only e3l was able to prevent thr <dig> phosphorylation. in cells expressing k3l or vif2α, thr <dig> was phosphorylated to the level observed in the absence of an inhibitor, whereas pkr mobility was comparable to that in e3l transformed cells. a likely explanation is that k <dig> and vif2α bind after the initial thr <dig> autophosphorylation and block subsequent phosphorylation events. this is in agreement with the finding that activated wt pkr, but not the pkr-t446a mutant, was able to bind k <dig>  <cit> .

like human pkr, zebrafish pkr was inhibited by e <dig> and vif2α. moreover, as was seen for human pkr, zebrafish pkr from cells expressing the inhibitors migrated faster on sds-page, indicative of blocked secondary phosphorylation events. an interesting difference between human and zebrafish pkr is that zebrafish pkr was resistant to k <dig> inhibition in both the growth and eif2α phosphorylation assays. in accord with our previous studies on pkr inhibition by k <dig>  <cit> , we propose that k3l might have evolved to suppress pkr of the natural poxvirus hosts and that zebrafish pkr is too different to be targeted with high efficiency. it is not clear why vif2α, which is found in amphibian and fish viruses, can inhibit both human and zebrafish pkr, but it is possible that vif2α targets more conserved residues in the pkr kinase domain than does k <dig>  previously we showed that k <dig> exhibits species specificity for inhibition of pkr. whereas human pkr was only moderately inhibited by vacv k <dig>  mouse pkr was much more sensitive  <cit> . this difference in sensitivity was attributed to residues that were subject to positive selection during evolution. interestingly, positive selection was also observed in the kinase domains of fish and amphibian pkr and fish pkz  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine whether vif2α also shows altered specificity for pkr or the related pkz of the species that are naturally infected with vif2α-containing ranaviruses.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, it appears that vif2α and k <dig> inhibit pkr in a similar fashion, by acting as pseudosubstrates and inhibiting pkr following kinase activation. as vif2α does not act as an eif2α substitute, but instead inhibits pkr function, the renaming of vif2α might be considered. we suggest changing the name from vif2α to ripr, the acronym for ranavirus inhibitor of protein kinase r.
