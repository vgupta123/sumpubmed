BACKGROUND
regulatory networks that govern fat and glucose metabolism are optimized to expend carbohydrates and accumulate fat when food intake is abundant, and switch to the consumption of stored fat when food is scarce. even subtle deregulation of these pathways can bring about obesity  <cit> , a significant risk factor for major diseases including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, liver disease and some cancers  <cit> . while obesity is a multifactorial feature, studies on twin and adopted children susceptibility to fat accumulation demonstrate that genetic predisposition is a key contributing factor in obesity  <cit> . thus, it is important to understand how the network of genes involved in fat metabolism exerts regulation across the whole system to regulate fat synthesis and storage.

the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has become a popular model for exploring the genetic basis for the regulation of fatty acid synthesis and storage  <cit> . although worm and mammalian physiologies differ greatly, many of the proteins involved in synthesizing, oxidising and transporting fats, as well as many of the fat-regulatory components are highly conserved between c. elegans and mammals  <cit> . furthermore, the genetic tractability of c. elegans allows one to take a global perspective for a complex trait such as the ability to store fat. a systematic rnai screen of the c. elegans genome identified  <dig> genes associated with reduced body fat and  <dig> gene associated with increased fat storage  <cit>  providing a powerful tool for the modelling of fat metabolism at the whole organism level. because of the complexity of metabolic regulation, a genetically tractable system like c. elegans offers exceptional potential to unravel the connections across the genome that regulate fat metabolism and have led to the discovery of mammalian genes involved in energy balance  <cit> .

c. elegans expresses the full range of desaturases activities found in plants  and animals   <cit> . the Δ <dig> desaturases are the rate limiting enzymes in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids which are used as preferred substrates for the synthesis of various kinds of lipids including phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. the crucial role of these enzymes arises because unsaturation of a fatty acid chain is a major determinant of the melting temperature of triglycerides, as well as the fluidity of biological membranes  <cit> . as a key control point in metabolic regulation, Δ <dig> has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

in c. elegans, the fat- <dig> gene encodes a palmitoyl-coa desaturase, while the fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> genes encode stearoyl-coa desaturases, and gene knockout strains have been generated and characterised using phenotypic analysis and gene expression, the vital staining of fats, the profiling of total fatty acids by gas chromatography   <cit> . while the single mutants displayed no obvious abnormal phenotypes, likely due to compensation by the other desaturases, the double mutants showed slow growth and reduced viability at low temperature, and the triple mutant was lethal unless supplemented with dietary oleic acid  <cit> .

however, while providing an important insight into the consequences of the deletion on the organism, such approaches have only partially described the variations in the global metabolism, focusing on changes in the composition of fatty acids, and not how these changes interact with other metabolic pathways, or how they influence the composition of complex lipids found within an organism. these aspects are crucial to be studied due to the central role of the Δ <dig> enzyme and its products in the regulation of metabolism. furthermore, questions have been raised as to which lipid species are stained by commonly used fat stains in genome wide screens of fat metabolism. in this study we have investigated the impact of deletion of fat- <dig>  fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> on both global systemic metabolism and, for the first time, intact lipids by lc-ms. using a range of techniques, including gas chromatography mass spectrometry  and nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy in addition to lc-ms, we aim to demonstrate that these deletions show marked changes in lipid composition and place c. elegans in a catabolic state not just in lipid metabolism but also in terms of the impact on the tca cycle and amino acid metabolism, demonstrating the influence the Δ <dig> desaturases have on regulating global metabolism.

RESULTS
to understand the consequences of Δ <dig> desaturase deletion on the metabolism of the whole organism in c. elegans, mutants defective in this enzyme were analysed using a wide range of metabolomic techniques, that allowed us to characterize both aqueous and lipid metabolites. we complemented our analysis by visualizing the fat content by vital and fixative staining methods. the aim is to integrate the rapid but generic results of the dyes with the deeper insights into metabolic changes obtained using the nmr or lc-ms techniques. as already reported in previous publications  <cit>  at 20°c the fat-6;fat- <dig> double mutant animals display a greatly reduced fertility and slow growth. these characteristics made the strain unsuitable for our studies, as it was neither possible to generate a sufficient number of animals in parallel with the other strains to be analysed, nor separate the metabolic changes associated with the genetic modifications per se and the restriction in growth/development.

staining of lipid deposits
we hypothesised that animals partially lacking Δ <dig> desaturase activity may have altered lipid content. to address this, global levels of fat storage in wild type and Δ <dig> desaturase mutants were assessed. the wild type, fat- <dig>  fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> mutants, as well as fat-5;fat- <dig> and fat-5;fat- <dig> double mutants were stained with both the vital dye nile red and with the fixative dye oil red-o, both of which have previously been used to characterize fat storage in c. elegans  <cit> .

quantification of nile red staining in l <dig> animals showed significant decreases in the intensity of staining for fat- <dig> , fat- <dig>  and fat-5;fat- <dig>  genotypes  compared with wild type. using nile red staining, as previously reported the fat-6;fat- <dig> mutant had a more pronounced reduction in lipid accumulation  <cit> . however, use of nile red has been criticized recently, suggesting that the dye could be treated as a xenobiotic by the animal and partitioned into a degradative compartment  <cit> . the oil red-o assay was performed , but did not show any significant difference between the strains .

the overall content of fatty acids , as quantified by gc-fid, decreased in mutants significantly compared with wild type for all the strains except the fat- <dig> mutant. however, the ratio between triglycerides and phospholipids , as obtained by lc-ms, showed no significant differences between wild type and any of the Δ <dig> desaturase mutant genotypes, except the fat- <dig> mutant: these results indicate that there is genetic redundancy between the Δ <dig> desaturases  <cit>  and suggest more complex remodelling of the lipid fraction than a simple decrease in the triglyceride content. therefore, these changes were investigated further in these mutants.

nmr analysis of aqueous extracts
proton-nmr spectroscopy was used to profile a range of aqueous metabolites including amino acids, organic acids, sugars and metabolites associated with lipid metabolism . principal components analysis  was performed on the nmr spectra of all the strains to characterise the major changes in the metabolic profiles . however, the first pc  revealed differences between batches of animals. to highlight the metabolic variation due to the Δ <dig> desaturase knock-out, multilevel simultaneous component analysis  was applied to the data set. the partial least squares-discriminate analysis  model obtained from the within-batches term of the msc analysis has  <dig> latent variables  = 56%, r <dig> = 64%, q <dig> = 34%) and separated the mutants according to genotype . the co-clustering between the metabolic profiles of fat- <dig>  and fat- <dig>  mutants may be expected as both fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> encode stearoyl-coa desaturases and they were shown to have functional redundancy  <cit> . clear discrimination was achieved for the two double mutant strains: fat-5;fat- <dig>  has a metabolic profile similar to the single mutants, while fat-5;fat- <dig>  lies in-between the two single mutants.

analysis of the loadings plot was used to identify the metabolites most responsible for this discrimination  - succinate , alanine , choline  and glycerophosphocholine  had increased concentrations in mutant strains, while branched chain amino acids  were increased in the wild type.

amino acid analysis of the aqueous extracts
a targeted analysis of amino acids was performed by gc-ms  <cit> , identifying  <dig> amino acids . as for the nmr experiments, a msc filter was applied to the amino acid data set, to remove the variability due to the batches. the pls-da model obtained from the within-batches term of the msc analysis had  <dig> latent variables by cross validation with a r <dig> = 63%, r <dig> = 59% and a q <dig> = 32% . this model produced good separation according to genotype including a notable distinction between the two single mutants lacking one of the two stearoyl-coa desaturases, fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> 

the loading plots associated with this analysis  demonstrated an increased concentration of branched chain amino acids  was found in the wildtype, while in the mutants there is a higher content of ornithine, cystathionine, asparagine and lysine. the fat- <dig> mutant was categorized by a particularly high concentration of alanine. additional file 1: table s <dig> summarises the characteristics of all the models built considering each mutant strain against the wild type. the list of the most significant amino acids changes considering each mutant against the wild type is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the lipid phase was characterised both by gc-fid and lc-ms. the first technique allows a characterization of the fatty acids present in the samples, without considering the origin of the fats as they are cleaved from the original lipid species during the trans-esterification. thus, lc-ms was also used to profile the intact lipids.

gc-fid analysis of lipid extracts
using gc-fid analysis of the c. elegans lipid extracts it was possible to identify straight chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids and cyclopropane fatty acids . as already reported  <cit> , the nematode is able to synthesize de novo branched chain fatty acids from branched chain-coa derived from leucine, valine and isoleucine. the cyclopropane fatty acids are synthesized by e. coli and absorbed through the diet.

in table  <dig>  the ratios between selected fatty acids highlighting the activities of the desaturase enzymes are reported. considering the single mutants, the ratio between c16: <dig> and c16: <dig> was decreased for the fat- <dig> mutant, as expected due to the fact that the palmitoyl-coa desaturase has been knocked out; the ratio between c18:1n <dig> and c18: <dig> decreased for both fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> mutants, as expected for the reduction in expression of stearoyl-coa desaturase. however, in the fat- <dig> mutant the ratio c18:1n9/c18: <dig> is significantly increased compared with the wild type , suggesting an increased production of c18:1n <dig> to compensate for the lack of c16: <dig> and c18:1n <dig>  the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acids. the ratios between c20:4n <dig> and c20:3n <dig>  in both fat- <dig> and in fat- <dig> mutants, and between c20:3n <dig> and c18:2n <dig>  in fat- <dig> mutants, were also changed as would be expected following the reduction in concentration of one of the main precursors in the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. for the double mutants, surprisingly, the ratios were not altered in the majority of cases compared to the wild type. this suggests a more complex reorganization of the system due to the lack of the palmitoyl-coa desaturase and one of the stearoyl-coa desaturase.

pls-da was applied to the within-batches term from msca of the gc-fid total fatty acids  data across all of the strains . this model demonstrated good separation among all the strains: the double mutant fat-5;fat- <dig> had the most different profile. in addition the two single mutants lacking one of the stearoyl-coa desaturase genes showed differences in their fatty acid content.

from an examination of the loadings plot  mutant strains had higher concentrations of saturated fas, reflecting the reduced capacity to convert them into monounsaturated fas. there was a general decrease in the intensities of the pufas. there was also a decrease in the branched fatty acids to an extent that the ratio between total content of pufa and branched fatty acid  increased markedly from the wild type to the mutant strains ,  <dig> ±  <dig> for fat- <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> for fat-5;fat- <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for fat-5;fat- <dig> ).

for both the double mutant fat-5;fat- <dig> and wild type there was relatively more c18:1n <dig> compared with the other genotypes . the fat-5;fat- <dig> mutant strain produces no fat- <dig>  so it cannot convert palmitic acid to palmitoleic  and thus, monounsaturated fats must be produced by fat- <dig>  the only desaturase that is still functional. in the other double mutant  the absence of fat- <dig> disrupts the normal ratio between oleic and stearic acid, despite retaining a functional copy of the highly expressed gene fat- <dig>  this suggests there may be both redundant and non-redundant roles for fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> 

lc-ms analysis of lipid extracts
in figure 3c, a typical chromatogram obtained analysing the intact lipids is shown. again a msca/pls-da approach was used to produce a model that separated all the strains . this model passed cross validation and more robust models were produced when two-way comparisons were considered with respect to the wild type strain . in particular the two single mutants lacking one of the two stearoyl-coa desaturase genes  were characterised by very different lipid profiles and contributions to the loadings plots . a common feature of most of the mutants, and in particular the single mutant fat- <dig>  was the higher content of triglycerides containing fatty acids absorbed from the diet ; tag; tag; tag), while others  had a higher content of triglycerides containing saturated fatty acids ; tag; tag). furthermore, decreased content of phosphocholine-lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids ; pc) was found in the mutants compared with the wild type strain.

gaussian graphical models on gc-fid experiments of the lipid fraction
the results obtained by the gc-fid experiments of the lipid fraction were also analysed using gaussian graphical models , weighted networks where nodes, representing the measured entities , are connected through edges annotated with the partial correlation coefficient between the two. the method aims to identify the correlations that remain between nodes if the effect of all the other variables has been removed from the contribution.

in figure 4a, the network obtained considering the  <dig> highest partial correlation coefficients of all the strains together is shown. the backbone of the synthesis of the straight chain fatty acids, from c14: <dig> to c22: <dig> is evident. interestingly, there are branches from c14: <dig> and c16: <dig>  linking either the next saturated fatty acid  or to the next monounsaturated fatty acid . other strong partial correlations are between c15:0-iso and c17:0-iso  and c17:0-delta and c19:0-delta with c18:3n <dig> .

in figure 4b and 4c the network obtained considering the  <dig> highest partial correlation coefficients for each strain against the wild type are shown. in each case, the backbone of the fatty acid elongation pathway can be identified. it is possible to note certain correlation patterns associated with the deletion of a given gene - for example, the cluster formed by c15:0-iso, c17:0-iso and c18:1n <dig>  in fat- <dig> mutants: c18:1n <dig> is synthesised by the elongation of c16:1n <dig>  obtained by desaturation from c16: <dig> by fat- <dig> palmitoyl-coa desaturase. the correlation structure for fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> mutants are markedly different, even though the genes both encode a stearoyl-coa desaturase, demonstrating their very different roles in regulating fat metabolism.

discussion
to date most studies focused on metabolic changes induced by modifying the expression of desaturases in c. elegans have used gc-based approaches to profile the total fatty acids present. in this study we extended this analysis to also include aqueous metabolism and intact lipids to demonstrate a profound perturbation in global metabolism induced by perturbing the expression of the desaturases. the perturbations detected across the network of metabolism highlights the usefulness of global profiling tools for functional genomics. the use of lc-ms to profile intact lipids provides greater detail in terms of the fatty acid changes when compared with gc alone, and the profiling of amino acid analysis provides a further insight into core aqueous metabolism, something which is often ignored in many studies of fat metabolism in c.elegans.

the expression profiles of stearoyl-coa desaturases are regulated by a large number of transcriptional and environmental inputs. in turn, the activities of these enzymes affect a large number of processes in the organism. the direct effects of knocking-out a desaturase enzyme is to modulate the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, but this in turns affects membrane fluidity, activates specific signalling pathways, and influences mobility or activity of membrane bound proteins. as part of this, reorganisation may happen through feedback mechanisms involving metabolites as signals, and hence a global metabolomic strategy is needed in order to fully define all of the perturbations induced across the network of metabolism and not only those in fatty acid synthesis.

the higher content of fatty acids in the wild type strain compared with the Δ <dig> desaturase mutants was demonstrated by both gc-fid and lc-ms analysis, yet it was not detected by oil red-o staining. previously, the fat content of these mutant strains has been measured by coherent anti-stokes raman scattering   <cit> , showing a  <dig> -fold decrease in the expression level of neutral lipid droplets for the fat-5;fat- <dig> double mutant. one reason for this discrepancy between the oil red-o staining and other methods is that the oil red-o method is typically not sensitive enough to detect such a variation. the decrease detected by gc and lc-ms is not only due to a reduction in the actual synthesis of the lipids, but also due to an increase in the catabolism of the fatty acids, with dietary fatty acids representing a larger proportion of the total fatty acid compliment. this is also supported by the increase in succinate, which indicates an increase in acetyl-coa metabolism via the glyoxylate cycle. a dramatic increase in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation has been reported in mutants where the desaturases have been knocked out  <cit> . in mice, the deletion of scd- <dig> leads to a decrease in the content of tag and cholesterol esters and down-regulates de novo fatty acid synthesis. furthermore, the deletion reduces lipid content by enhancing oxidation  <cit>  and thus, an increase in catabolism following reduced desaturase activity appears to be highly conserved. it has also been shown that during fasting the concentration of stearic acid is maintained due to a strong fasting-dependent repression of the fat- <dig> gene, when peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation are selectively stimulated  <cit> , suggesting a regulatory interaction between fat- <dig> and β-oxidation, possibly by sensing the concentration of stearic acid. moreover, an increase in the fatty-acid-binding proteins lpd-1-lpd- <dig> has been observed in the desaturase knocked-out mutants  <cit> : these proteins sequester and transport fatty acids and acyl-coa esters, facilitating their intracellular utilization, storage and signalling functions. an increase in their expression suggests an increment in the traffic of the fatty acids in the cell and is in agreement with an increase in their catabolism detected in this study.

however, this is not the only reorganization in the lipid content of the mutants. the results show a reduction in some of the phosphocholine derivatives in the mutants, in particular in those containing unsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a reorganisation of the cell membrane. this may be because the cell membranes have a reasonable amount of tolerance to the inclusion of saturated fatty acids, and the conservation of pufas for specific roles such as the synthesis of signalling molecules. indeed, there is an enhancement in the heat-stress tolerance when animals are treated with rnai for fat- <dig> and fat- <dig>  <cit>  arising from the increased incorporation of saturated fatty acids in the membranes. the changes in phosphocholine metabolism could only be followed in this high level of detail by the use of lc-ms. the approach detects the lipids directly and using fragmentation patterns we can deduce how changes in total fatty acid profiles effect the different phospholipids found in c.elegans.

the efficient storage of lipids within lipid droplets appears to be highly dependent on the generation of mufas. unsaturated fas, but not saturated fas, induce the formation of lipid droplets or increase the size of the existing lipid droplets. this is confirmed by the fact that when supplemented with vaccenic acid  the concentration of tags were increased in mutants with peroxisomal dysfunctions  <cit> . furthermore, an impairment in desaturase activity is correlated with a decreased ability to generate and expand lipid droplets to facilitate tag storage. under conditions where mufas are in short supply to prevent the accumulation of toxic saturated lipids within the cytoplasm mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation is stimulated  <cit> , possibly through the action of nhr- <dig>  the c. elegans homologue of pparα.

the fact that both bfas and mufas decrease in the present study further suggests a general increase in the catabolism of fatty acids, and thus while unsaturated fats may compensate for a lack of bfas the reverse is not necessarily true. indeed, when the double mutant fat-6;fat- <dig> is treated with nhr- <dig>  an increase in the concentrations of branched fatty acid was found. this was attributed to a general increase in fatty acids synthesis  <cit> .

there is an inverse correlation between the concentration of c17iso in tags and fat storage levels  <cit> . c17iso is proposed to act as a chemical/nutritional indicator of the metabolic state of c. elegans. as this fatty acid is the final step of a synthesis that is initiated from the amino acid leucine, the concentration of c17iso may reflect the concentrations of essential dietary amino acids and more generally protein and lipid homeostasis in the organism. Δ <dig> desaturase-deleted mutants have both reduced content of branched fatty acids and essential amino acids.

previously, the focus of metabolic studies on these strains has been on the changes in the fatty acid composition. in the present study, in addition to profiling intact lipid metabolites and cleaved fatty acids, also a non-targeted profiling of the aqueous phases was performed, demonstrating that the changes associated with the deletion of the desaturases are not limited to the lipid fractions but extend to the entire metabolome. the increase in the concentration of alanine in the mutants, indicative of increased glycolysis and consumption of amino acids, as well as an increase in succinate suggesting increased metabolism through the citric acid cycle are indicative of a general increase in catabolism. furthermore, the increased content of branched amino acids in the wild type compared to the mutants seems to confirm this higher catabolic state accompanying the deletions of the Δ <dig> desaturase genes. these amino acids are the starting point for the synthesis of the branched fatty acids, but both branched chain amino acids and fatty acids decrease in concentration in the mutant, suggesting increased catabolism of both metabolite classes. the higher content of choline, a precursor of membrane phospholipids, in the mutants compared to wild type is another indicator of the lipid reorganization.

there is numerous evidence suggesting that fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> have both redundant and non-redundant functions. our results show differences in the behaviour of both the two single mutants and the two double mutants. the analysis of the amino acid profiles by gc-ms indicates a different influence of the two genes on other metabolic pathways, such as amino acid anabolism and catabolism. the analysis on the intact lipids also demonstrated an increase in absorption of cyclopropane fatty acids in the fat- <dig> single mutant to compensate the absence of desaturation. this strain lacks the most highly expressed Δ <dig> desaturase. other strains, instead, show an increase in the content of saturated fatty acids in the lipids. these results are confirmed also by the analysis of fatty acids by gc-fid: there is an increase in the content of c17:0_Δ in the fat- <dig> verses wild type model, not present in the fat- <dig> verses wild type model. however, without lc-ms it would have not been possible to follow this remodelling of the triglycerides.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that deletion of Δ <dig> desaturases have profound effects on metabolism in c. elegans that far extend from the initial reduction in mufas. in particular, the major results obtained by our comprehensive characterization were that:

i. the mutants had increased accumulation of triglycerides from dietary or saturated fats. however, overall the total fat content was decreased in the mutants compared to the wild type indicative of increased catabolism;

ii. a reduction in some phosphocholine derivatives in the mutants, especially those containing unsaturated fatty acids, suggest reorganisation of cell membranes.

iii. a general increase in fatty acid and amino acid catabolism in the mutants.

currently the majority of studies of fat storage in c. elegans rely on whole animal staining, gas chromatography analysis of total fatty acids or thin layer chromatography of lipid classes. however, the propagation of the changes into a wide range of metabolic pathways highlighting the usefulness of global profiling tools for functional genomics.
