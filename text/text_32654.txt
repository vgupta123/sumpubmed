BACKGROUND
the hypopharyngeal gland  of the worker bee is a paired long tuberous organ connected to many acini each of which is composed of about a dozen secretory cells  <cit> . the hg secretes a proteinaceous substance which is fed to larvae, queens and drones. it has attracted much attention in research, not only for its most striking feature which is it's age dependent role associated with the shifting of tasks from nursing to foraging worker bees  <cit> , but also for its importance in royal jelly  production  <cit> . morphologically, acini size of the hg radically changes with age  <cit> . peak size is found at around  <dig> days in bees during the summertime, when workers are known to feed the larvae with rj  <cit> , but it begins to decrease after day  <dig>  the volume of the acini and the number of secretory vesicles decreases, and no vesicles are visible after  <dig> weeks of age. it has also been reported that the hg size is positively correlated with gland activity  <cit> .

physiologically, the normal course of the development of these glands  is well described  <cit> . the glands are well developed during the stage of ontogenesis when the individuals are acting as nurse bees and they degenerate when these individuals become foragers, although at the beginning of their foraging career bees can still have well developed glands  <cit> . the hg is fully developed and shows high rates of protein synthesis in nursing bees, but regresses in foraging bees  <cit> . it is believed that the hg exists in two distinctly differential states, first producing rj for brood nutrition, followed by enzyme production, e.g. age-polymorphism  <cit> .

biochemically, in accordance with the age-dependent role, the glands express a specific gene for the  <dig> kda protein  in the nurse bee, while the gene for α-glucosidase is expressed in the forager bee glands only  <cit> . some reports also confirm that foragers could produce α-glucosidase  <cit> , which increases with the age of workers  <cit> , glucose oxidase  <cit> , and other enzymes such as galactosidase, esterase, lipase and leucine arilamidase  <cit>  to process nectar into honey. the expression of these carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes in the hg is age-dependent in worker honeybees  <cit> . in contrast, the gene coding for a  <dig> kda protein is expressed in both the nurse bee and forager bee glands  <cit> . santos et al  <cit>  identified the protein complement of hg of africanized nurse bees  and almost all were related to the mrjp family and associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates and energy.

several morphological, physiological and biochemical approaches have been documented in the study of the honeybee hg development. however, these findings are mainly derived from conventional and/or transcriptional data reflected by expressed genes. since changes in the protein level in many organisms are not accompanied by altered level of transcription, previous research on the hg development could not describe the entire picture well of this fascinating developmental problem. proteomics, a global strategy for mining the protein information, is of great importance for developmental studies. the recent sequenced honeybee  genome and transcriptome  <cit>  has stimulated new efforts in investigating the proteome profile during the gland development. the aim of the present study was to obtain a protein profiling of the hg development on a global scale, thus making possible a leap from the study of individual genes or proteins to an integrated understanding of how gene networks enable complex functions to be carried out. this leap has the potential to exponentially expand our knowledge of honeybee biology.

RESULTS
protein profiling of hg at different developmental phases
protein samples from  <dig> different points of time, occurring during the development of hg of honeybee workers were analyzed by 2-de. figure  <dig> is a representative gel image of the best  <dig> runs, showing the soluble proteins extracted from the hg of honeybee workers on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  using the pdquest analysis software, a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins were detected at  <dig> time points, respectively, with mr encompassing from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda and pi from  <dig>  to  <dig> . among them,  <dig> proteins were resolved in all images at each developmental phase with mr and pi in the range of  <dig> ~ <dig>  kda and  <dig> ~ <dig> , respectively. besides, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins uniquely expressed on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . totally,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins were identified successfully at each time point, respectively, their detailed information is shown in supplementary table s in additional file  <dig>  the protein spots remained unidentified were mainly attributed to their values being too low to produce a spectrum, or because the c. i. % of the database search was not higher than 95% in order to yield unambiguous results.

among the identified proteins, the most present form was found to be mrjps increasing from  <dig> ~ <dig> % from day 1-day  <dig>  the second largest category was related to the metabolism of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates decreasing from  <dig> ~ <dig> %, of which proteins related to metabolism of carbohydrates were the most present form. the third largest group was the proteins with folding functions, decreasing from  <dig> ~ <dig> %, of these heat shock proteins  were the highest in number. while the proteins that regulation of transcription and translation process were presented most on day  <dig> and day  <dig> accounting for  <dig> ~ <dig> %, on the other days it was presented at a rate of  <dig> ~ <dig> %. and developmental regulating factors were represented from  <dig> ~ <dig> %. additionally, skeleton, antioxidant and transporter proteins were  <dig> ~ <dig> %,  <dig> ~ <dig> % and  <dig> ~ <dig> %, respectively .

expressional analysis of the identified proteins
based on the statistical analysis of the identified proteins,  <dig> proteins differentially expressed in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates,  <dig> proteins, i. g. proteasome subunit α type  <dig> , proteasome catalytic subunit  <dig> , lethal  g <dig> , arginine kinase , acyl-coa dehydrogenase , enolase , aldehyde reductase , yippee interacting protein  <dig>  expressed higher at early stages of the hg development, while glucose oxidase  and α-glucosidase  related to digesting nectar into honey, expressed higher at later stage of the hg development. in addition, the proteins that form the skeleton , regulation of development , transcription and translation  decreased along with the hg development. and the proteins with folding functions  had a higher expression on day  <dig> . mrjp <dig>  expressed significant higher on day  <dig> and day  <dig> than those other days. among the altered expression of mrjp <dig>   <dig> isoforms  expressed at higher level on day  <dig>  and  <dig> major isoforms of mrjp <dig>  expressed high level on day  <dig> and day  <dig> 

to further validate the change of protein abundance at different developmental stages, mrjp <dig>  mrjp <dig> and mrjp <dig> were selected and applied to western blot analysis as shown in figure  <dig>  the band volume was measured by quantity one . it was clear that mrjp <dig>  mrjp <dig> and mrjp <dig> significantly increased their expression just from immediate emergence to 6-day-old workers, and then decreased after day  <dig>  but the expression of these proteins was at peak level during day 6-day  <dig> . this was consistent with the results of 2-de generally.

network analysis
since proteins perform their functions together in networks, we analyzed all the pathways and interactions connected to all the identified proteins hoping to find the possible key node proteins during the hg development using pathway studio software. it showed that  <dig> of the identified proteins acted as key node proteins. these proteins were  <dig> proteins related in metabolism of carbohydrate and energy production, i. g. aldehyde reductase , transitional endoplasmic reticulum atpase , sterol carrier protein x-related thiolase , atp synthase β subunit , atp synthase α subunit , enolase  and malate dehydrogenase ;  <dig> proteins with folding functions, i. g. calreticulin , heat shock protein  90-α isoform  <dig> , hsp  <dig> ,  <dig> kda hsp , small hsp20-like chaperone , hsp cognate  <dig>  and hsp cognate  <dig> ;  <dig> proteins related to antioxidant activities, superoxide dismutase , glutathione s transferase s <dig>  and thioredoxin peroxidase  <dig> ;  <dig> proteins involving in development, guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit β-like protein  and lethal   <dig> cc  <dig> cc);  <dig> cellular skeleton proteins, cofilin/actin-depolymerizing factor , act 87e , β-tubulin  and f-actin capping protein α subunit ;  <dig> proteins acting as transcription and translation regulators, shown as ribosomal protein s <dig> , 40s ribosomal protein s3a , 40s ribosomal protein s <dig> , 40s ribosomal protein s <dig> , 60s acidic ribosomal protein p <dig> , rna-binding protein  <dig> , 40s ribosomal protein s <dig> , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a , elongation factor 1-alpha , eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1-γ , proliferating cell nuclear antigen  and gtp-binding nuclear protein ran  .

discussion
this study employed a systematic analysis of the whole time-range of the honeybee hg at the protein level, in parallel with metabolic pathway approaches. some of the biochemical pathways were built up where  <dig> key node proteins were found in all the identified proteins. to our present knowledge, this is the first large scale and all around analysis of the development of hg in this model organism. the results provide a global perspective on the protein and the biochemical pathways involved in the hg development of the honeybee workers, helping us to better understand honeybee biology. obviously, some different spots in gels were identified to be the same proteins in supplementary table s . they were isoforms and their different distributions in gels might be caused by some post-translational modifications , such as phosphorylation and possibly alternative splicing that resulting in a shift of mr and pi of these proteins.

the hg of honeybee workers goes through the undeveloped, developed and regressive phases accompanying the shifting of tasks from nursing to foraging within  <dig> days in a normal colony. in young workers, usually not more than  <dig> days past eclosion, the hg, which is fully developed and shows high rates of protein synthesis in nursing period, is already secreting rj for brood breeding. eighteen days later, when workers become foragers, the hg begins to regress and produce enzyme products to digest nectar into honey  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> time points were chosen in an attempt to distinguish proteins expressed at different time points in the whole range of the hg development. based on the proteomic profile, we could clearly observe that  <dig> and  <dig> day-old hgs expressed more proteins than that of the others. the proteins that were identified in each time point varied greatly, and belong to a broad range of different classes and functional pathways , implying a wide range of proteins are necessary for the hg development.

rj, secreted from the hg and mandibular gland of the worker honeybee  <cit> , is the exclusive food for the queen honeybee and young larva  <cit> . theoretically, mrjps, including mrjp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  should be the main contents in the hg. the identified mrjps in this study have validated these assumptions. attributed to the potential glycosylation sites and extensive repetitive regions in the c-terminal of the proteins  <cit> , some isoforms of mrjp <dig> and mrjp <dig> were present in this study. interestingly, mrjps were identified in the 1-day-old hg and 3-day-old hg had a typical pattern of rj . this suggests that the newly emerged honeybee workers are likely have the ability to secrete rj and start to produce rj much earlier than expected. it was confirmed by western blot that mrjp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could be detected from day  <dig>  and by day  <dig> express at significantly higher levels than those of day  <dig> . furthermore, the hg secreted rj at peak level from  <dig> to  <dig> days, which could also be confirmed by western blot analysis . these findings show that the period from  <dig> to  <dig> days is the peak time for the workers to secret rj and nurse the brood. after that the output of rj begins to decrease because of the shifting tasks and the shrinkage of the hg  <cit> .

eighteen proteins were related to the metabolism of carbohydrate and energy production involved in glycolysis , citric acid circle , and atp generations   in the present study. seven of them were detected as key node proteins  . both the higher number and most of the differentially expressed were in the early stages, suggesting that not only the development of the hg needs much metabolic energy for cell divisions and secretory synthesis in this early period, but also the honeybee has an evolutionary strategy to cope with the selective pressure on its extremely carbohydrate-rich diet  <cit> . the down-regulated of these proteins in the latter period are coincided well with drosophila that gene encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism are down-regulated during the late larval ecdysone pulse  <cit> . acyl-coa dehydrogenase  is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, which fuels hepatic ketogenesis during prolonged fasting and periods of higher energy demands  <cit> . the down-regulated here is probably due to the honeybee worker dropping its lipid storage dramatically prior to the onset of foraging. the main task for the forager bee is to collect nectar and divert it into honey by adding some enzymes, such as α-amylase  and α-glucosidase . these transferases could digest polysaccharides, disaccharides into monosaccharide. the up-regulated of α-glucosidase  coincides well with the task changes of the honeybee workers. the expression of glucose oxidase  in this study  is likely used for the biological production of gluconic acid and for the removal of either glucose or oxygen from foodstuffs in order to improve their storage capability  <cit> . so the up-regulated of this acid is also related to the work of the workers.

hsps function primarily as a molecular chaperone, facilitating the protein folding, preventing protein aggregation, or targeting improperly folded proteins in specific degradative pathways  <cit> . the third largest group in this study was related to proteins with folding functions, of which hsps were the most represented forms. six of them, hsp <dig> , hsc70- <dig> , hsp <dig> , cg <dig> , hsc70- <dig>  and hsc70- <dig> , were the key node proteins for the hg development . in honeybees, the enhanced expression of hsps and cell death in the midgut of the bee's larvae infected with paenibacillus larvae or bacillus larvae  <cit> , the larval salivary glands treated with acaricides  <cit>  and under heat stress conditions  <cit>  have been well documented, which could be a defense mechanism to prevent against stress tolerance. hsps have widely been identified in honeybees, including worker larvae  <cit> , the embryos  <cit> , the head and brain of the workers  <cit> , the hemolymph  <cit>  and the venom gland  <cit> , respectively. the higher number of hsps identified in the early stage  and higher abundance expressed from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  suggests that they probably act as molecular chaperones by assisting in the correct folding of nascent proteins, thus contributing to cell maintenance and protein  secretory activity of the hg since our experiment was carried out under normal physiological conditions.

the present identified antioxidant proteins involving jafrac <dig> , thioredoxin reductase- <dig>  sod , gsts <dig>  and peroxiredoxin  <dig> , could also been found in the honeybee embryo  <cit> , the venom gland  <cit>  and the hg of wintering honeybee workers  <cit> . among them, gsts <dig>  jafracl and sod played the key role for the antioxidant system in the developing hg . sod, thioredoxin reductase and peroxiredoxin  <dig> are able to metabolize peroxides  <cit> ; and jafracl, a superfamily of detoxication protein, can change xenobiotic to harmless products  <cit> . the oxidative damage caused by the reactive oxygen species  is to be intensified with the increase of ros due to a high demand for oxygen in fast growing organism  <cit> . therefore, the hg during the nursing period is fully developed and shows high secreting activity, which means the metabolism in this stage is vigorous; on the contrary, the metabolism is slowed down in the hg of foraging bees because of the regression and low activity of the hg  <cit> . as a result, the up-regulated of gstsl in the early stage, followed by a down-regulated in the late stage, is responsible for the changes with the development of the hg in this study.

the cytoskeleton plays important roles in both intracellular transport and cellular division. among the identified cytoskeletal proteins, β-tub60d , f-actin capping protein α subunit , tsr , ptx <dig>  were the key node proteins in the cytoskeletal system . among those key node proteins, tsr and ptx <dig> showed a significantly down-regulated trend . actin plays an important role during dorsal closure throughout the embryonic development in drosophila  <cit> , and tsr, which restricts the actin polymerization  <cit> , appears to have control of actin-based motility processes and enhances removal of adp bound actin monomers from the pointed end of an actin filament  <cit> . down-regulated of them in the latter developmental phase coincides with the secretory activity and the acini size of the hg beginning to decrease after  <dig> days when workers becoming foraging bees  <cit> , cell death predominates in the latter foraging period  <cit> .

obviously, the development of hg requires the presence of growth factors to ensure its development. rack <dig>  and l <dig> cc , acting as key node proteins, were the growth factors in the hg development of the honeybee workers. in drosophila, rack <dig> is expressed at all developmental stages and in many tissues. it is essential at multiple steps of drosophila development, particularly in oogenesis  <cit> . lethal   <dig> cc is required for larval metabolism from larvae to pupae, and is expressed in early embryos, late embryos, late third instar larvae and adults of the drosophila  <cit> . overall, the down-regulated of rack <dig>  suggests that a decrease in the secretory activity and lower growth factor titers are demanded with the regression of the hg.

a group of proteins were identified as being responsible for the initiation of translation and accuracy of elongation, with  <dig> were the key node proteins . pcna , a highly conserved protein, is an essential component in the dna replication and dna repair  <cit> . it is also required for some repair pathways, including ner  <cit>  and mismatch repair  <cit> . in drosophila, temperature shift studies reveal that the vital function of pcna is required throughout virtually all stages of fly development  <cit> . eif-5a  is involved in the first step of peptide bond formation in translation and is essential for cell proliferation and cell-cycle regulation  <cit> . while ef-1α  is a nuclear protein coding gene involved in the gtp-dependent binding of charged trnas to the acceptor site of the ribosome during translation. in drosophila, ef-1α is expressed at different times during development  <cit> . at the same time, several ribosome proteins   were identified involving in the cellular process of translation  <cit> . in addition to their ubiquitous expression, these proteins are present simultaneously and in essentially fixed ratios in the ribosome and in the cell as a whole. it has shown that disrupting ribosome function can result in an array of fascinating dominant phenotypes in drosophila  <cit> . rps <dig>  is very crucial for translation as a component of the 40s ribosomal subunit, and also acts as a damage dna endonuclease  <cit> . sop  mainly participates in aminoacyl-transfer rna binding to the ribosome, potentially affecting the fidelity of mrna translation  <cit> . rplp <dig>  plays an important role in polypeptide chain elongation during translation. most of the rps identified in this study that have been documented in ribosomal proteome of the drosophila  <cit> . newly synthesized ribosomal proteins are found in association with ribosomal subunits as soon as  <dig> min after fertilization of drosophila embryos  <cit> . the ribosome number is thought to control cellular growth  <cit> , in this regard, the fast growing cells need more rps to insure their growth. the expression of rps in this study did not increase within  <dig> to  <dig> days might attribute to the increased cell proliferation does not always correlate with the higher expression level of ribosomal  <cit> . some ribosomal proteins may have more specific roles in regulating proliferation than simply influencing the rate of protein biogenesis. as such, their increased expression may be a separate phenomenon from the general increase in the synthesis of ribosomal proteins in dividing cells  <cit> . in general, the highest key node proteins in this group that altered their expression are likely to work together to regulate the process of transcription and translation for the regular development of the hg and rj secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used proteomic and biochemical network analysis to describe the protein profile of hg within the whole range of the development. a number of proteins were successfully identified and several key node proteins were analyzed. these proteins were involved in multiple functions and took part in a variety of biological processes. the results not only expand our knowledge of honeybee biology, but also provide us some target proteins when genetically manipulating this model insect. the present study found molecular evidence that the newly emerged worker bees could secrete royal jelly. behavior observation should be conducted to test that whether these workers have the ability to nurse brood when they emerge from the comb cells. it would be better if the proteomics data could be verified by the transcriptome profile of the hg. this would give a more comprehensive understanding of the hg development.
