BACKGROUND
aflatoxins  are polyketide family secondary metabolites produced by several members of the fungal genus aspergillus, section flavi. considered amongst the most dangerous natural hepatotoxic carcinogens in mammals  <cit> , consumption of foodstuffs contaminated with these extrolites can be a cause of mortality and reduced productivity in higher vertebrates. within this family, afb <dig>  b <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> cause most concern, given their abundance and toxicity  <cit> . the mycotoxin cyclopiazonic acid   <cit>  can also be produced by aspergilli. this toxic indole tatramic acid is associated with damage to liver, heart and kidneys  <cit> .

the taxonomy of the genus aspergillus is complex, with overlapping morphological characteristics and biochemical properties between species, as well as intraspecific polymorphism  <cit> . aspergillus section flavi comprises over  <dig> member species, based on polyphasic approaches for species delimitation that consider morphological, molecular and extrolite data  <cit> . a number of species within the section are aflatoxigenic, including the widely distributed species a. flavus, a. parasiticus and a. nomius, together with a. arachidicola, a. bombycis, a. minisclerotigenes, a. parvisclerotigenus, a. pseudocaelatus, a. pseudonomius and a. pseudotamarii, , a. novoparasiticus <cit> , a. mottae, a. sergii and a. transmontanensis <cit> .

brazil nut  is a protein-rich oily nut, which, as an extractivist tree crop, provides employment to communities in the amazon region. currently, bolivia and brazil are the world’s largest producers, with annual production in excess of  <dig> thousand tons  <cit> . aflatoxin contamination negatively affects exports, with maximum tolerable limits imposed by the european commission of  <dig>  μg/kg and  <dig>  μg/kg for afb <dig>  for unshelled and shelled nuts, respectively, and  <dig>  μg/kg and  <dig>  μg/kg for total aflatoxins . a. flavus and a. nomius are common aflatoxin producers on brazil nut  <cit> , with less frequent isolation of aflatoxigenic species a. arachidicola, a. bombycis, a. parasiticus and a. pseudotamarii <cit> . non aflatoxigenic species include flavi section members a. caelatus and a. tamarii, as well as aspergilli which are not classified in the section, such as a. versicolor and a. sydowii <cit> .

given that morphological characters can be insufficient for distinguishing certain species belonging to section flavi, numerous molecular-based approaches have been developed. these have included analysis of rdna its and aflr-aflj intergenic spacers for differentiation of a. flavus and a. parasiticus <cit> , as well as aflp and snp analysis for differentiation of a. flavus/a. oryzae, a. parasiticus/a. sojae, a. tamarii and a. nomius <cit> . sequence-based approaches include analysis of rdna its and 28s rrna variable regions  <cit> , together with calmodulin and β-tubulin gene regions  <cit> . variability in the latter two genes can be appropriate for resolving closely related aspergillus species  <cit> . molecular identification of nine species of section flavi was recently described, based upon amplification of aflt and aflr genes and rdna its regions, genomic dna smai-derived rflps, and rapd fingerprinting  <cit> . specific detection of section flavi species in contaminated material has been described using both pcr e.g.  <cit>  and loop-mediated isothermal amplification  <cit> .

hazard analysis critical control point  methods are employed to reduce the risk of contamination of foods with microbial pathogens, toxins or allergens  <cit> . when setting up haccp concepts, species identification is necessary for determining critical control points  in the field, storage or transport. in this context, the objectives of this study were to identify aspergillus species occurring on brazil nut from different states in the brazilian amazon region on the basis of morphological, molecular and extrolite data, followed by the development of a pcr method for collective identification of member species of the genus aspergillus.

RESULTS
identification and abundance of aspergillus species
polyphasic identification of all  <dig> aspergillus strains isolated from brazil nut shell material collected from cooperatives across the brazilian amazon region  revealed the presence of five species, with three belonging to aspergillus section flavi. blastn-derived analyses against aspergillus species sequences deposited in genbank for ex-type strains revealed similarities of between  <dig> and 100% for rdna its, β-tubulin and calmodulin sequences.

qualitative analysis of mycotoxigenic potential in representative strains of the aflatoxigenic species isolated from different regions revealed, for a. flavus, afb <dig>  afb <dig> and cpa production in  <dig> evaluated strains, and afb <dig> and cpa production for a further five strains. from a total of seven examined strains of a. nomius, five produced afb <dig>  afb <dig>  afg <dig> and afg <dig>  one produced b <dig> and g <dig>  and one produced b <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  cpa was not detected in a. nomius.

when considering totals for each species from all growing areas analysed, aflatoxigenic species a. nomius and a. flavus were the most abundant, representing  <dig>  and  <dig> % of all isolated aspergilli, respectively . the non aflatoxigenic species a. tamarii was observed at a lower overall frequency . aspergillus species which do not belong to section flavi were also isolated, with one isolate of a. fumigatus from amapá and one isolate of a. niger from amazonas. when comparing a. nomius and a. flavus, although similar numbers of strains were identified in total, numbers varied considerably across regions, with a. nomius more frequent in samples from amapá, coari , itacoatiara  and manicoré , and a. flavus more common in contaminated material from acre and humaitá .

mtdna primer development for genus
following sequence alignment of a portion of the mtdna ssu rrna gene from genbank-derived sequences for all available aspergillus species, specific primers asp_gen_mtssu_f <dig>  and asp_gen_mtssu_r <dig>  were designed for amplification of a 480 bp pcr product specific for the genus . in silico analysis of the specificity of the primer pair was based upon electronic pcr against mtdna ssu rdna gene sequences available at genbank for the genus aspergillus and fungi from additional genera previously reported on brazil nut  <cit> . positive nucleotide blast search results with 0% mismatch were observed against target mtdna ssu rrna from all available aspergillus species, as well as teleomorphs from the genera chaetosartorya, emericella, eurotium and petromyces. for all additional fungal genera documented on this host, primer annealing sites were absent in sequences. wider testing across all deposited fungal mitochondrial dna sequences in genbank revealed primer target sequences in mycena sp., monascus purpureus and leiothecium ellipsoideum, although expected amplicon sizes were at least 41 bp shorter than that expected for the genus aspergillus.

when validating specificity of the primer pair against fungal dna, a pcr product of the expected size was amplified only from members of the genus aspergillus, with no amplification observed for other fungal genera associated with b. excelsa . an iac was included for co-amplification in each sample to prevent false negative results which could potentially be caused by pcr inhibitors  <cit> . an iac concentration of 10 pg was identified as optimum for simultaneous amplification of the 480 bp specific aspergillus amplicon and the 330 bp iac with primers asp_gen_mtssu_f <dig>  asp_gen_mtssu_r <dig> and m <dig> reverse. validation of the specific primers for detection of aspergillus dna directly from naturally contaminated samples showed that amplification of the genus-specific pcr product was possible from a minimum of 10 ng of total dna extracted from brazil nut material.

rflp analysis
restriction maps for the specific mtdna ssu rrna amplicon for the genus were compared across the aspergillus species isolated from brazil nut. minor nucleotide sequence differences were detected, with the restriction endonuclease drai appropriate for differentiating the isolated aspergillus section flavi members from other species in the genus also encountered on brazil nut. according to the restriction maps for the five isolated aspergillus species in this study, two conserved restriction sites are present for this enzyme in the target amplicon region for the isolated aspergillus section flavi members a. flavus, a. nomius and a. tamarii, which should result in pcr product cleavage into fragments of  <dig>   <dig> and 237 bp. predicted restriction digest patterns were compared in mtdna ssu rrna sequences available in genbank for section flavi species a. parasiticus, a. oryzae and a. sojae, together with the a. flavus synonyms a. kambarensis, a. subolivaceus and a. thomii <cit> ), and for the a. tamarii synonym a. terricola <cit> ). these sequences showed the same two conserved drai restriction sites, in contrast to distinct rflp profiles observed in sequences for aspergillus species not belonging to section flavi , as well as in the aspergillus teleomorphs and non-target genera mycena, monascus and leiothecium.

in order to validate the restriction mapping data, pcr rflp analysis was conducted on pcr-amplified specific mtdna ssu rrna amplicons across the different aspergillus species isolated. pcr-rflps with drai confirmed differentiation of these three section flavi members from the other aspergillus species, with digest patterns in agreement with in silico data .

discussion
morphology-based methods for identification of species of the genus aspergillus can be unreliable as a result of both intraspecific similarities and differences  <cit> . in this present study, identification of aspergillus species on brazil nut from different states in the brazilian amazon region was conducted according to samson and varga  <cit>  and baquião et al.  <cit> , through morphological and molecular characterization, together with extrolite profile . as observed in previous studies for section flavi <cit> , species identifications based upon analyses of rdna its, β-tubulin and calmodulin gene sequence identities against sequences for ex-type strains available through the ncbi nucleotide nr database provided results in agreement with morphology-based identification and extrolite production.

the frequency we observed of aflatoxigenic aspergillus section flavi species from brazil nut shell material confirmed recent reports that a. nomius and a. flavus are abundant species on brazil nut across production areas in the brazilian amazonian region  <cit> . in our study, these two species represented over 85% of all aspergillus species isolated. qualitative analysis of mycotoxin production in strains of the mycotoxigenic species representative of the different states of origin supported the identifications, with a. flavus strains producing afb and cpa, and a. nomius producing afb and afg, without cpa production. the extrolite profiles are in agreement with expected chemical characterization data for these member species in the section  <cit> .

given the documented widespread occurrence of both a. flavus and a. nomius on brazil nut, together with the known capacity to produce mycotoxins afb and cpa, and afb and afg, respectively, the presence of these species on husk materials represents a threat to safe production of brazil nut. as the section flavi species a. tamarii and a. fumigatus are also documented producers of cpa  <cit> , the occurrence of these species on brazil nut highlights the need for regulations which also consider this mycotoxin.

pcr-based molecular diagnosis of microorganisms offers specificity and sensitivity appropriate for early detection, appropriate for both haccp purposes  <cit>  and implementation of countermeasures for control of microbial contamination. as brazil nut is an extractivist crop, with aflatoxigenic species occurring throughout the production chain  <cit> , safe production is dependent upon identification of ccps and subsequent implementation of detection methods at these points. the mitochondrial genome is an attractive molecule for application in fungal taxonomy and systematics, with a rapid rate of evolution and limited genetic recombination  <cit> . for aspergillus, both specific and intraspecific level comparisons have been described  <cit> . considering the high copy number per cell, mitochondrial dna  is also easily amplifiable by pcr and appropriate for characterization through rflp analysis. in the current study, analysis of the mtdna ssu rrna gene region enabled the design of a genus-specific primer pair for amplification of a 480 bp pcr product in aspergillus. specific amplification was possible using dna extracted from pure cultures, as well as from naturally contaminated brazil nut samples. together with the developed iac, this pcr-based method has potential for inclusion in the setup of haccp concepts. many attempts with genetic markers for differentiation of section members at the interspecific level have not provided sufficient resolution for detection of small differences across the fungal genomes. in the case of the closely related species a. flavus and a. oryzae, minor differences across the genome can only be revealed by detecting differences across numerous loci, such as digestion of total dna with restriction endonucleases  <cit>  or aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway gene interspecific polymorphism  <cit> . similarly, the closely related species a. parasiticus and a. sojae can only be distinguished using genetic markers such as rapd  <cit> . our approach based upon the use of genus specific primers for mtdna ssu rdna followed by rflps appeared to resolve phylogenetically distant species, with the three section flavi member species encountered in this study all displaying a single rflp profile. in silico analysis of restriction sites in the target mtdna ssu rdna sequence for all aspergillus species available in genbank supported the observed polymorphisms delimiting in a group specific manner, separating section flavi species from other species not classified in the section. further investigation of this polymorphism is warranted across all member species of the section.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, five species of aspergillus were identified on brazil nut material from cooperatives across states in the brazilian amazon region, with the aflatoxigenic aspergillus section flavi species a. nomius and a. flavus the most abundant. a specific pcr-based method for identification at the genus level was developed, which also enabled collective differentiation of the observed section flavi species a. flavus, a. nomius and a. tamarii from other aspergillus species, on the basis of rflp polymorphism. given the widespread distribution of aspergillus section flavi species and associated risk of food contamination due to mycotoxin accumulation, simple molecular methods to aid identification of mycotoxigenic species are of importance in identification of ccps at the point of production and storage, from which appropriate management practices can be developed.
