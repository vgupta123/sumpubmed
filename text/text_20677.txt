BACKGROUND
pax <dig> is a member of the pax family of transcription factors  <cit> , characterised by the presence of a paired-type homeodomain  <cit> . pax <dig> is expressed in a number of different organs in the developing mouse embryo, including the ureteric bud, kidneys  <cit>  and otic vesicle  <cit> . in the developing nervous system, pax <dig> is first detected at embryonic day   <dig>  in the neural plate, in the area of the presumptive midbrain-hindbrain region  <cit> . at e <dig> , pax <dig> displays a broad expression domain in this region, which by e <dig>  is restricted to the isthmus at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary  <cit> . pax <dig> expression in the isthmus ceases after e <dig>  <cit> . in the cerebellum, pax <dig> is specifically expressed by a subset of cerebellar gabaergic interneurons and their precursors, from e <dig> until the end of cerebellar development   <cit> . in the spinal cord, pax <dig> expression is found in the intermediate zone as early as e <dig>   <cit> . in the developing eye,pax <dig> expression is initiated at e <dig> in the ventral half of the optic vesicle. by e <dig>  after invagination of the optic vesicle, both pax <dig> transcript and protein are detected at high levels in the ventral opening of the optic cup, the optic fissure, and the optic stalk, ending at the border with the diencephalon  <cit> . after e <dig> , pax <dig> protein expression is still present in the ventral optic cup, although the level is decreased, and it is no longer detected after e <dig>   <cit> . pax <dig> is also expressed in glial cells in the optic nerve  <cit> .

pax <dig>  another member of the pax family, is expressed in the dorsal telencephalon, diencephalon, hindbrain regions and spinal cord  <cit>  and throughout the developing optic cup, but is absent from the optic stalk and optic nerve  <cit> . mutant mice lacking functional pax <dig> protein , display a large range of nervous system defects, including absence of eyes  <cit> , disruption of dorsoventral telencephalic patterning  <cit>  and the diencephalic-mesencephalic boundary  <cit> . pax <dig> and pax <dig> are expressed in neighbouring, but mutually exclusive domains in the developing eye ,  <cit> , and in the diencephalic-mesencephalic region  <cit> . in the developing spinal cord, pax <dig> is expressed by many types of early differentiated neurons, located in the mantle zone and surrounding pax6-positive neural precursors in the ventricular zone  <cit> . fewer pax2-positive interneurons are found in the pax6sey/sey mutant, indicating that pax <dig> is required for their development  <cit> .

we have recently described a group of diencephalic cells at the border region between the diencephalon and the telencephalon that expresses pax <dig> protein at e <dig>   <cit> . at e <dig> , these pax2-immunopositive cells form a distinct cell population at the most dorso-lateral tip of the eminentia thalami  <cit> , a diencephalic structure that joins the ventral diencephalon to the dorsal and ventral telencephalon  <cit> . here, we describe previously unidentified areas of pax <dig> expression in the developing mouse forebrain. further, we show that pax <dig> expression is maintained in the septum of pax6sey/sey mutants, which are known to have an enlarged septum. this study highlights the value of pax <dig> as a novel marker of forebrain development.

RESULTS
domains of pax <dig> expression in the developing mouse forebrain
we examined pax <dig> expression in the early forebrain using immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryos . at e <dig> , a few pax2-immunopositive cells were detected within the ventral telencephalon in lateral sagittal sections , with the staining becoming more intense in mid-sagittal sections . in addition, a small population of pax <dig> immunopositive cells was detected in the neuroepithelium of the anterior hypothalamus, adjacent to the optic recess area . at e <dig> , strong pax <dig> expression was found in the developing septum  with no pax2-immunopositive cells detected in the neighbouring lamina terminalis . as in e <dig>  embryos, a number of pax2-positive cells were found close to the base of the hypothalamus but also in more dorsal areas of the anterior hypothalamus . at both e <dig>  and e <dig> , pax <dig> expression was found in previously described regions such as the ventral neuroepithelium of the optic recess   <cit> , the optic cup   <cit>  and near the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary , which will give rise to the eminentia thalami  <cit> .

pax <dig> protein expression was then examined at e <dig> , on coronal and sagittal sections along the caudo-rostral axis of the developing mouse forebrain . the strongest expression domain of pax <dig> was detected in the telencephalon. the pax <dig> antibody labelled most cells of the septal neuroepithelium, located in close proximity to the dorso-medial telencephalon . this strong and characteristic pax <dig> expression in the septum was also observed in sagittal sections, in the region where the lamina terminalis joins the septum . only a few pax2-immunopositive cells were detected within the neighbouring lamina terminalis .

specific pax <dig> expression was also detected in small clusters of cells in regions of the hypothalamus. the pax <dig> antibody labelled a group of cells located at the lateral hypothalamic area , and a narrow strip of cells parallel to the anterior hypothalamic ventricular zone . a few pax2-immunopositive cells were also detected along the base of the hypothalamus, excluding the midline region . these groups of pax2-positive cells can also be distinguished in a sagittal plane . the cell populations indicated by the arrowheads and small arrows , located just above the optic recess area, correspond to the respective populations indicated in fig. 2b. the pax <dig> positive cells located close to the third ventricle, indicated with large arrows in fig. 2d', correspond to those shown in fig. 2b'. in coronal sections of the caudal forebrain, specific pax <dig> expression was also detected in a small cluster of cells resembling a nucleus in the neuroepithelium of the anterior hypothalamus . in accordance with previous reports, pax <dig> expression was also detected in the ventral neuroepithelium of the optic recess area at the base of the hypothalamus , retina   <cit>  and eminentia thalami at the level depicted in fig. 2b   <cit> .

double immunofluorescence with pax <dig> and β-tubulin iii , a marker of early neural differentiation found in neurites, revealed that a very low proportion of septal cells labelled with pax <dig> co-expressed β-tubulin iii , suggesting that the majority of the pax2-positive cells in this region are neural precursors. this was confirmed by double immunohistochemistry with pax <dig>  and nestin , an intermediate filament protein found in radial glia, which showed that the β-tubulin iii-negative/pax2-positive cells in the septum express nestin . in the hypothalamus, most of the pax2-positive cells found close to the ventricle  are also positive for β-tubulin iii, showing that these cells are newly formed neurons . the pax2-positive population indicated by arrowheads in panels 2b and 2d' also expressed β-tubulin iii, even more extensively than the other hypothalamic pax2-positive cells . finally, the pax2-positive cells located close to the hypothalamic ventral midline  did not express β-tubulin iii, but were positive for nestin, indicating that they correspond to neural progenitors .

at e <dig> , pax <dig> was detected in cells located at the septal midline . expression was strong and specifically confined to the septal neuroepithelium, at the point where the septum joins with the future hippocampus via the lamina terminalis . at more rostral telencephalic levels, a small number of pax2-immunopositive cells were found in the differentiating field of the septum .

pax <dig> expression in the hypothalamus at this age was similar to that seen at e <dig> , with the exception that the immunopositive cells in the lateral hypothalamic area and the base of the hypothalamus shown in fig. 2b, were no longer detectable . no pax2-immunopositive cells were found in the eminentia thalami after e <dig>  .

at e <dig> , coronal telencephalic sections revealed similar pax <dig> expression to that described at e <dig>  . as for the earlier ages examined, pax <dig> expression was mainly confined to the septum, in the neuroepithelium adjacent to the lamina terminalis, as depicted in the mid-sagittal section in fig. 4a and 4a. in the e <dig>  hypothalamus, pax <dig> expression was limited to a very narrow band of cells, localized in the differentiating field of the anterior hypothalamus and reaching the medial horn of the lateral ventricle . we could not detect these immunopositive cells in the coronal plane, probably because of their narrow field of expression. expression was also found at the optic recess area as previously described  <cit> , .

by e <dig> , the main pax <dig> expression domain in the developing septum was located in the differentiating field of the medial septum. it was mainly found in a stripe-like cell arrangement, parallel to the midline and surrounded by the fibre bundles of the fornix . at this developmental stage, the only pax <dig> expression detected in the hypothalamus was in the optic stalk epithelium, just above the optic chiasm region , in a few cells of the hypothalamic neuroepithelium, adjacent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus  and in a few scattered cells in the medial preoptic nucleus.

during early postnatal development only a few pax2-positive cells were detected in the forebrain. at postnatal day   <dig>  pax <dig> immunopositive cells were detected scattered in the most caudal sections of the septal area, at the level where the fornix is found in proximity to the anterior commissure . as at e <dig> , a few cells were found close to the fornix, in the medial septal area, as well as in the border zone between the medial and lateral septum . pax <dig> also labelled the medial preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus . at p <dig>  a similar expression pattern was observed . in addition, pax <dig> was detected in the subfornical organ , one of the circumventricular organs of the brain involved in fluid balance  <cit> . pax <dig> expression was no longer detected at p <dig> .

expression of pax <dig> in the septum in pax6sey/sey mutants
to validate pax <dig> as a marker of the septal neuroepithelium, we used the pax6sey/sey mutant, which has been shown to have an enlarged septum  <cit> . using double immunofluoresence, we first examined expression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in e <dig>  wild type embryos. in rostral telencephalic sections, pax <dig> was strongly expressed in the dorsal, lateral and ventral pallium, with its most ventral expression domain expanding into the lateral ganglionic eminence, just below the pallial-subpallial boundary , as previously described  <cit> . pax <dig> was expressed at lower levels in the medial pallium but did not overlap with the expression domain of pax <dig> in the septal neuroepithelium .

using pax6sey/sey mutant embryos, we examined whether loss of pax <dig> affects pax <dig> expression in the septum. no gross changes in the extent of the main pax <dig> expression domain were observed, although the intensity of pax <dig> staining appeared reduced in pax6sey/sey mutants compared to the wild type . in addition, pax <dig> expression was observed in a more dorsal area compared to wild type, revealing a larger septum in the mutant , in accordance with previous published data  <cit> . this result was consistent in all mutants examined . double immunofluorescence with antibodies for pax <dig> and the septal marker lim <dig> , using an antibody that detects both lim <dig> and lim <dig>   <cit> , showed that in both wild types and pax6sey/sey mutants, pax <dig> expression was confined within the lim1/ <dig> positive domain . this shows that the shifted area of pax <dig> expression observed in the pax6sey/sey mutant most likely corresponds to ventral telencephalic tissue, and not to ectopic pax <dig> expression in the dorsal telencephalon.

pax2-positive cells in the early postnatal septum do not express markers of gaba-ergic or cholinergic neurons
to gain further insight into the neurochemical properties of the differentiated pax <dig> cells detected in the septum, we examined co-expression of pax <dig> and markers of gaba-ergic and cholinergic neurons, the principal neuronal types of this structure  <cit> .

to examine whether the pax2-positive cells detected postnatally might be gaba-ergic we performed double immunostaining experiments with pax <dig> and calbindin, a calcium-binding protein that has been shown to label a large population of gaba-ergic somatospiny neurons in the adult septum  <cit> . a large number of neurons were labelled with an antibody for calbindin in the postnatal septum . however, pax2-positive cells did not colocalize with calbindin, neither at p <dig>  nor at p <dig> . to examine whether the pax <dig> immunolabelled neurons might be cholinergic, we performed double immunostaining experiments with appropriate markers. at p <dig>  we examined co-expression of pax <dig> and islet <dig>  a protein that has been shown to label some populations of cholinergic septal neurons  <cit> . no co-localisation of these two proteins was detected . choline acetyltransferase , the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme in cholinergic neurons, can not be detected clearly in septal neurons by means of immunohistochemistry before p <dig>  <cit> . we examined co-localization of chat and pax <dig> at p <dig> by means of double immunostaining . as shown in fig.  <dig>  at p <dig> a few cells in the septum start expressing chat but do not express pax <dig> .

discussion
specific markers expressed in different regions of the developing nervous system are widely used as tools to study neural development. here, the expression of pax <dig>  a well-studied marker of the isthmus, spinal cord and developing eye, has been re-examined, using a polyclonal antibody, and novel areas of pax <dig> protein expression have been identified in the ventral telencephalic septum and the developing hypothalamus. the polyclonal antibody used in the present study recognizes the same epitope described by dressler and douglass  and has been previously used by several groups to characterize pax <dig> protein distribution  <cit> . in this study, the use of paraffin sections subjected to microwaving for antigen retrieval, in contrast to the cryostat sections used previously, may have allowed the identification of the previously undescribed domains of pax <dig> expression.

pax <dig> staining in the hypothalamus is first detected at e <dig>  and comprises a few cells in the ventricular zone, dorsal to the optic recess. by e <dig> , pax <dig> positive cells are found in a region that extends from the area of the optic recess to the lateral ventricle that will give rise to the anterior hypothalamus. comparison of the distribution of pax <dig> positive cells in this region at e <dig>  and e <dig>  suggests that they might follow a migratory path towards dorsal regions of the anterior hypothalamus. by e <dig> , fewer pax2-positive cells are present than at e <dig> , and these are restricted to the dorsal anterior hypothalamus. pax <dig> is expressed in the optic stalk, a structure that joins the optic cup to the brain, and that ends at the base of the hypothalamus  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the small population of pax2/β tubulin iii-positive cells in the developing anterior hypothalamus described here, may arise from the optic stalk and collaborate with other cellular hypothalamic cues in guiding the trajectory of the optic nerve.

pax <dig> is also expressed in the eminentia thalami, a transient developmental structure of unknown function  <cit>  that joins the ventral diencephalon to the telencephalon  <cit> . pax <dig> expression in the eminentia thalami is first detected at e <dig>  at the dorsal border between the diencephalon and telencephalon  <cit> , and this staining can not be detected after e <dig> . the pax2-positive cells in the eminentia thalami do not express β-tubulin iii, indicating that they are most likely to be neuronal precursors. the early appearance of these cells at the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary  suggests that they might be important for the formation of this boundary.

consistent, high levels of pax <dig> expression were also observed in the septum of the basal forebrain. pax <dig> is first expressed at e <dig>  by a small number of cells located in the ventral telencephalon. it seems likely that these cells give rise to the pax2-positive population observed in the septal area one day later. by e <dig> , septal pax <dig> expression although strong, is confined to the septal neuroepithelium, mainly at levels proximal to the lamina terminalis. only a few pax2-positive cells are observed in the differentiating layer of the septum. septal expression is also observed at later developmental stages, but by e <dig>  it is downregulated and becomes restricted to a small population of differentiated cells in the medial septum. during septal development in rodents, cells migrate from the lateral ventricle towards the midline. the medial nucleus is one of the first nuclei formed in the septum  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the sparse pax2-positive cells observed at e <dig>  correspond to the pax2-positive cells observed in the differentiating field of the septum between e <dig>  and e <dig>  .

pax <dig> is still expressed by a few cells located in the medial and lateral septal areas during postnatal development and it is not detected after p <dig>  the majority of neurons in the medial and lateral septum are cholinergic or gaba-ergic  <cit> . mature cholinergic neurons express the enzyme choline acetyltransferase   <cit> , whose expression in the septum becomes detectable at around p <dig>  <cit> . at this age, pax <dig> expressing neurons are still found in the septal region but do not co-express chat, suggesting that these cells might not be of the cholinergic type. however, it is also possible that the pax <dig> immunopositive cells might develop into cholinergic neurons at later time points when chat expression has increased and pax <dig> expression has been turned off. similarly, calbindin is expressed by a large number of somatospiny gaba-ergic neurons in the adult septum  <cit>  and it is present in the postnatal septal area, but it does not co-localize with pax <dig>  indicating that the pax <dig> septal neurons are not of this particular gaba-ergic type. as there many different types of gaba-ergic neurons in the septum  <cit> , it is possible that the pax2-positive cells might develop into a different type, such as the septohippocampal projection neurons, a prominent gaba-ergic population comprised of parvalbumin-positive cells  <cit> . although a few of these cells are first detected at around p <dig>  <cit> , when pax <dig> expression is still detectable in the septum, they become clearly visible after p <dig>  when pax <dig> expressing cells are no longer present in the septum. again, this expression pattern precludes us from being able to draw conclusions about the specific neuronal type of these cells based solely on immunostaining techniques. cell fate experiments using a pax2-cre mouse strain and an appropriate cre reporter strain would allow us to address which type of neurotransmitter fate and properties the pax2-positive septal neurons adopt.

in the developing eye, there is a sharp boundary between the domains of pax <dig> expression in the optic stalk and pax <dig> expression in the optic cup,  <cit> . mutual cross-repressive interactions between pax <dig> and pax <dig> are essential for formation of this boundary  <cit> . here we show that pax <dig> and pax <dig> are expressed in neighbouring, non-overlapping domains in the rostral telencephalon, reminiscent of the pattern observed in the developing eye  <cit> . given this expression pattern, and the fact that the septum is enlarged in pax6sey/sey mutants  <cit> , we hypothesised that the pax <dig> septal expression domain might be expanded in this mutant. however, we found no increase in the extent or intensity of pax <dig> expression in this region in pax6sey/sey mutants. nevertheless, the pax <dig> expression domain was found at a more dorsal position than in the wild type, consistent with the previously described size increase of the septum in the pax6sey/sey mutant  <cit> . the pax <dig> expression domain still lies within the ventral telencephalon, as shown by co-expression of the septal marker lim <dig>  <cit> .

there are several mouse models with different types of mutations in the pax <dig> locus, including the krd mice , a mutant with a chromosomal deletion that includes this locus  <cit> , pax2-/- null mutants  <cit> , and pax21neu mice with a frameshift mutation in pax <dig>  <cit> . all of these mutants display defects in kidney formation, optic nerve trajectory, and inner ear patterning, consistent with previously identified expression domains of pax <dig> transcript  <cit> . however, defects in the midbrain-hindbrain region range from complete loss of the posterior mesencephalon and cerebellum in the pax21neu mouse  <cit> , to no phenotypic alteration in the pax2-/- mutant  <cit> , possibly as a consequence of differences in genetic background  <cit> . it would be of interest to study the telencephalic septum in these different mutants, to identify any possible alterations due to loss of pax <dig> expression in this region.

CONCLUSIONS
pax <dig> is expressed in the anterior hypothalamus, eminentia thalami and telencephalic septum in the developing mouse forebrain, in neuronal progenitors and early born neurons. between e <dig>  and e <dig> , it is strongly expressed in the septal neuroepithelium, at a level close to the lamina terminalis and it is no longer detectable by p <dig>  further, the absence of functional pax <dig> does not cause gross alterations of pax <dig> expression in the septum. thus pax <dig> represents an ideal marker for the study of the developing septum.
