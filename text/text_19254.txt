BACKGROUND
genomic variations within a species may involve changes as small as a single nucleotide to as large as microscopically visible chromosome segments, even whole sets of chromosomes. while microscopic genome variations were studied in cytogenetic laboratories for a long time, the readily availability of dna sequencing technology and high throughput approach have popularized analysis on single nucleotide polymorphism  and microsatellites. it was not until recently that genome variation involving intermediate dna segments, called segmental copy number variation , was recognized. this type of genome variation involves submicroscopic insertion, deletion, segmental duplication and complex changes of greater than  <dig> kb to several mb in size  <cit> . whole genome scanning studies for cnv have been conducted extensively in humans  <cit> , chimpanzees  <cit> , dogs  <cit> , mice  <cit> , rats  <cit>  and swine  <cit> . although several chicken cnv loci have been studied in a case-by-case manner  <cit> , cnv in birds has received little attention. to our understanding, few publications are available describing whole genome cnv studies in birds  <cit> .

since its domestication  <dig>  years ago, the chicken has provided table eggs, meat and ritual values to human society. over the last  <dig> years, the chicken has also served as a model organism for fundamental biological and biomedical studies  <cit> . the first examples of oncogene and viral induced tumor were demonstrated in the chicken  <cit> . the b-lymphocytes were first identified in chickens. spontaneous chicken mutants, such as the dwarf  <cit>  and the retina degeneration  <cit> , have provided rich information regarding particular gene functions. the regulation of chicken ovalbumin expression was studied extensively to elucidate the mechanism of eukaryotic transcription control  <cit>  and steroid hormone actions  <cit> . because of the historical, biomedical and agricultural importance, evolutionary distance and readily availability, the chicken is the leading species among farm animals in the development of genomics tools and resources, including the chicken genome assembly  <cit> , genetic variation map of single nucleotide polymorphism  <cit> , collections of comprehensive expressed sequence tags   <cit>  and dna microarray  <cit> .

distinct from mammalian genomes, typical avian genomes are composed of several large chromosomes and a group of microchromosomes that are indistinguishable microscopically with conventional karyotyping techniques  <cit> . the chicken genome has  <dig>  billion base pairs on  <dig> pairs of chromosomes, including a pair of sex chromosomes zz for males and zw for females  <cit> . despite that the chicken genome is one third of a typical mammalian genome in dna content, it was predicted to have a similar number of genes  <cit> . thus, it would be conceivable that the chicken has reduced intergenic spaces and reduced repetitive sequence content. how the compacted genomes vary in chromosomal segmental copy number and how these variations affect important agricultural and biomedical traits are of great interest. here we provide a snapshot of cvns in the chicken genome.

RESULTS
mapping of cnvs in chickens
nimblegen whole genome tiling arrays containing  <dig>  probes were used to analyze chicken cnvs. four broilers , four leghorns  and two rhode island reds  were analyzed with array comparative genome hybridization . one additional male broiler dna was used as a reference for all hybridizations. cnvs were identified by comparing ratio between the test and the reference and all cnv loci were visually inspected on acgh data plots . we identified  <dig> high confidence or suggestive cnvs. when cnv signals in two or more animals overlapped on a chromosome, they were considered to be high confidence cnv. on average, seventeen cnvs were called in each bird.

these cnvs were found on chicken chromosomes  1- <dig>  10- <dig>   <dig>  22- <dig>  and z . due to poor probe coverage, data on w chromosome were removed from analysis. the  <dig> cnvs encompassed  <dig> mb, which is about  <dig> % of the entire chicken genome. among the  <dig> cnv loci, forty six loci were non-coding sequences .

note: *, the start position of the cnv was based on  <dig> chicken genome assembly. #, gain or loss was assigned based on common reference dna from one broiler bird . †, rhode island red.

there were  <dig> high confidence cnvs that were observed at least in two birds . among these high confidence loci, eleven loci involve non-coding sequence only, which sum up to  <dig> kb. the remaining  <dig> loci occupied about  <dig>  mb, involving one or more coding sequences.

variations at locus  <dig>  on gga <dig>  appear to be complex. when compared with the reference, three birds showed loss of 150- <dig> kb, while two other birds showed a gain of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb. locus  <dig> on gga <dig> has three clearly different alleles, one of which was a gain of  <dig> kb and the other was a loss of  <dig> kb region and the third allele was without gain or lost. however, visual inspection of corresponding acgh plots revealed that several other samples may also have copy gains .

in our dataset, two cnv calls were made for chromosome  <dig>  one of the calls appears to be a gain of an entire chromosome  <dig> in bird # <dig> , but no obvious visual abnormality of the bird was observed. the other cnv involves the first 10-kb region of the chromosome assembly.

the majority of the high confidence cnvs was shared across breeds, suggesting their relative "ancient" origin. some high confidence cnvs were specific to individual breeds. whether they are breed-specific requires further evaluation of a much larger sample size. it is not clear whether these putative private cnvs contribute to breed specific biology. fewer high confidence cnvs were found in rhode island reds when compared with other strains evaluated. this may be attributable to the small number of animals analyzed, small founder population and/or population diversity.

seventy cnvs, which encompassed  <dig> mb, were observed only once in our data set . of the seventy cnvs, twenty seven cnvs involved only non-coding sequences . twenty nine cnvs showed loss of dna while the rest showed gains of dna. the majority  of cnvs with dna loss were non-coding sequences. in contrast, the majority  of cnvs with gain of dna involve coding sequences. in addition, sizes in cnvs of dna loss tend to be smaller  compared with that of dna gain .

although probes assigned to unknown chromosome locations were excluded from cnv calls, an ambiguous segment on gga  <dig>  is noteworthy. the entire segment was  <dig> kb according to the genome assembly. several ests and mrnas were mapped to this segment. data from acgh strongly support that this region be assigned to w chromosome  <cit> : all female birds showed gain of copies with high scores, when compared with the reference.

quantitative pcr analysis and cnv validation
real time quantitative pcr  was performed to validate acgh data at five loci. two of the five loci  served as references of no variation in copy number, while three loci were cnv detected with acgh. the pcca locus encodes propionyl coenzyme a carboxylase. analysis of chicken genome assembly indicated that a single copy of this gene exists in a haploid genome. two copies of thrsp genes exist in chickens  <cit> . the qpcr results for pcca locus showed minimal variations among  <dig> birds . we attribute these variations to random errors, including dna dilution error. similar qpcr results were obtained for thrsp locus in  <dig> birds , which also showed minimal variations among birds except that two birds appeared to have lost copies . three cnv loci  were examined twice: once estimated with standard curve method  in  <dig> birds and once with 2-Δct method in  <dig> birds . results of the two separate qpcr assays were concordant. f-tests were performed to determine whether copy numbers detected with qpcr have the same variance between the reference locus and cnv loci. results indicate that all three cnv loci had greater variance than the references , suggesting the three loci were truly cnv.

locus  <dig> involves rhacd <dig>  which was reported to have variable copy numbers among different breeds of chickens. our qpcr data indicated relative copy number of rhacd <dig> locus was highly variable among chickens. birds with the highest copy number had seven times as much as those with the lowest copy number.

locus  <dig> involves prolactin receptor gene . in our acgh assay, this locus was identified in  <dig> females. another bird appeared to be false negative, because visual inspection of acgh plots revealed likely shifting of the log <dig> ratio . subsequent qpcr analysis showed that all female birds have a single copy, and males showed  <dig> or  <dig> copies. since prlr is located on gga z, males are expected to have two copies per cell, whereas females have one copy should there be no cnv. however, χ <dig> tests indicated that the relative copy number ratio were 3: <dig> between males and females . it appeared that the male chicken #  <dig> did not have three folds the copy number of females. however, after dna concentration correction, its relative copy number was the same as other males. results of the separate qpcr assay with 2-Δct method agreed with this notion. the sex specific cnv at this locus can be explained by the industrial practice, as recently reported by elferink  <cit> . a sex-linked late feathering allele k containing  <dig> copies of prlr has been introduced to commercial flocks and used widely for sexing hatchlings. this k allele is incomplete dominant to the early feathering k+ allele containing one copy of prlr. one of our bird suppliers crosses k+k+ males with kw females, such that progeny females are early feathering k+w containing one copy of prlr, while the male progeny are late feathering kk+ containing three copies of prlr.

the cnv locus on gga  <dig>  involving aldo-keto reductase 1b , was first identified as a suggestive cnv found in only one bird with a gain of copy. a qpcr assay showed that the variation in copy number was far more frequent  than it appeared in the acgh: all leghorn chickens had the least copies  and all rhode island reds doubled that figure, while cornish rock broilers have variable numbers from  <dig> to  <dig> copies. visual inspection of this locus in acgh plots did not reveal convincingly significant variations.

complexity of chicken cnvs
in order to understand genomic organizations of dna sequences involved in cnv, we mapped dna sequences that are similar to the ones in cnv regions by blat search. this mapping revealed the organization complexity of some cnvs. for example, according to chicken genome build  <dig> , locus  <dig> on gga  <dig> showed duplication of various blocks in a 90-kb region . this locus contains at least  <dig> copies olfactory receptor-like sequences, organized in grossly three larger repeating units in the same orientation. blocks of several hundred to several thousand base pairs are highly conserved  among these repeating units. however, the relative positions of these blocks were shuffled to different places.

the cd8α locus on gga  <dig> is also organized in a complex way. although it is known to be polymorphic among breeds  <cit> , we did not anticipate such complex and extensive variations as revealed by qpcr. other loci examined also show more or less complexity.

functional implications of chicken cnvs
among the high confidence cnv loci, at least  <dig> loci involve partial or entire functional genes. many of these functional genes have paralogs in the chicken genome. for example, cnv locus  <dig> on gga  <dig>  encodes a zinc finger rna binding protein . in the chicken, a second copy of zfr is located on z-chromosome . locus  <dig>  involves an olfactory receptor 6k <dig> -like sequence.

the cnv at chrm <dig> locus  was observed in two of the leghorn birds. chrm <dig> is one of the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor genes that play important roles in numerous physiological functions including higher cognitive processes such as memory and learning  <cit> . est and other sequence data indicate that the chicken chrm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are located on chromosome  <dig>  while chrm <dig> and  <dig> are mapped to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. our acgh data suggest the loss of chrm <dig> copies in leghorn chickens. analysis of chicken whole genome assembly has not found any evidence that chrm <dig> locus involves a recent duplication. thus, deletion of chrm <dig> is more likely the scenario in the leghorn birds.

according to the may  <dig> chicken  v <dig>  draft assembly, the chicken akr1b locus contains  <dig> consecutive copies of akr1b organized head-to-tail. although all copies appear to be transcribed since ests were found for all of them, the telomere-proximal copy appears to be more actively transcribed, as evidenced by the greater number of ests found for this copy. the four akr1b copies share 80-92% amino acid residues. however, the telomere-proximal two copies are less similar from each other as well as from the two centromere-proximal copies in intron sequences. the two centromere-proximal genes contain large blocks of sequences similar to each other, including introns. in vertebrates, each species has several akr1bs that are expressed in most tissues  <cit> . the akr 1b subfamily catalyzes the reduction of aldehydes  <cit> . members of aldose reductase  may regulate fatty acid synthesis  <cit> .

an est was found to be derived from cnv locus  <dig>  the sequence have been predicted to be a cd8α- like messenger rna -rhacd <dig>  which was shown to be expressed in spleen  <cit> . we seek to determine whether the copy number variation could affect the level of rhacd <dig> transcript. spleen rna levels of rhacd <dig> and cd8α were examined in five broiler and five leghorn females with rt-qpcr in two separate experiments . rna levels determined with 2-Δct method were highly correlated with those determined with standard curve method . glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and β-actin mrnas were examined as controls. levels of β-actin mrna varied remarkably among these chickens . gapdh mrna levels were less variable , though bird #  <dig> showed much higher level of gapdh transcript. cd8α mrna level appeared to be correlated with the level of rhacd <dig> transcripts , at a marginal statistical significance . but there was no evidence of correlation between levels of rhacd <dig> transcript and dna copy number .

comparative genomics of chicken cnvs
since the platforms for cnv detection vary from species to species, much of the information cannot be compared directly across species. however, similarities can be found among studies using species-specific nimblegen tiling arrays  <cit> . the nimblegen mammalian arrays usually have a greater median probe space  than the chicken array . accordingly, the average cnv sizes detected in mammals are larger than in chickens. however, the cnv calls in each individual are comparable among mouse, dog, and rhesus macaques  <cit> . because the human genome was studied more extensively, up to  <dig> % of human genome have been found in cnv regions  <cit> . lower cnv coverage was found in other species. our current data showed that chicken dna sequences residing in cnv regions account for  <dig> % of the genome, similar to that found in rat  <cit> . however, it is likely a significant underestimation of real cnvs in chickens, since a limited number of individuals have been surveyed. furthermore, due to the incompleteness of the chicken genome assembly, a significant portion of the genome was not surveyed. the entire w chromosome was excluded from the analysis, and all probes that were assigned to chrun and chromosome-random were also excluded.

out of thirteen chicken-turkey cnvs reported by griffin et al,  <cit> , three loci overlapped with our high confidence cnvs and four loci overlapped with our cnvs of single observation. these data suggest that some of our single observations are true cnvs. the overlapping loci have size disagreement between griffin's and our study, possibly due to the use of different references. red jungle fowl was used as the reference by griffins et al, while a cornish rock broiler bird was used as the reference in our study. the discrepancy may be attributable to non-recurrent rearrangement. apparently, larger populations need be examined to obtain a comprehensive picture of chicken cnv.

it is conceivable that lost dna segments tend to be small in size and non-coding, while large cnv regions tend to emerge from gain of dna and involve more functional genes, because large segment loss may be detrimental when these alleles are homozygous. similar observations were also found in other species  <cit> . a significant number of cnvs involves members of paralogs. this can be explained by the fact that paralogous genes may compensate for lost copies. similarly, a significant enrichment of cnvs in segmental duplications was found in the mouse  <cit> .

it appeared that acgh method tends to report larger segments being involved in the duplication/deletion than they really are. for example, the acgh reported the involvement of  <dig> kb in the duplication of the k locus on z chromosome. detailed studies by elferink et al  <cit>  showed this duplication involves only  <dig> kb. this discrepancy is consistent with recent report that most cnvs are smaller in size than revealed by larger probe spacing  <cit> .

it is of major interest to map the impact of cnvs in relation to disease, immunity, and agricultural traits. it has been shown that some cnvs contribute to phenotypic variations while others are amenable for genome-wide association study for their influence on genetic disease or disease susceptibility. nevertheless, large amount of putatively functional sequences, including protein coding sequences and conserved non-coding sequences, fall within or flank cnvs. in humans, although most cnvs were detected in apparently "healthy" individuals, many cnvs may have subtle, quantitative or late-onset phenotypic implications  <cit> . functional attributes of the currently known cnvs are remarkably enriched in genes involved in environmental molecular interactions, including cytochrome p <dig> genes, immunoglobin-like receptors, defensins  <cit> . cnvs may affect phenotype by altering transcriptional level of genes within or adjacent to cnvr and subsequently alters translation levels. such transcriptional and translational changes have already been demonstrated  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the chicken genome was examined for chromosomal segmental copy number variations with whole genome tiling arrays. twenty six high confidence cnvs that were observed in two or more birds and seventy cnvs that were observed once were identified. the majority of the high confidence cnvs was shared across breeds . fifteen cnv loci involve functional genes, or spliced est coding sequences. although cnvs that were observed once require further confirmation, some of them represent true cnvs.

the mapping of cnvs in chicken could provide new opportunity for understanding genomic variation and related phenotypic characteristics. this mapping will also contribute to association studies in effort to map traits of economic importance.
