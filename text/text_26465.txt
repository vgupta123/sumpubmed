BACKGROUND
the stability, organisation and dynamics of genomes are key factors that influence the molecular evolution of life  <cit> . genomic single-nucleotide mutations, with their subsequent fixation in a population, occur an order of magnitude more frequently than common insertions/deletions  <cit> , hence are major contributors in defining the genome evolution. an understanding of the descriptors that govern single-nucleotide mutations and substitutions is thus essential to comprehend genome dynamics and its link to the underlying molecular processes.

for the sake of lucidity in pointing to different contributions on substitution rates, which may encompass both mutation- and fixation-based effects, let us introduce a break down of the rate into a number of general components. for a given genomic position and i→j nucleotide conversion, the substitution rate, as expressed by the rate constant r
i,j, can be roughly presented as a single-base average value ri,jsb and fluctuations contributed by short-range context , cpg-associated , long-range , gene/functional , and specific  effects : 
  <dig> ri,j=ri,jsb+δri,jsr+δri,jcpg+δri,jlr+δri,jgene+δri,jspec 


the ri,jsb term can be estimated through genomic averages for the individual i→j substitutions, and has been explored for the genomes of human  <cit>  and other species . by investigating the aggregation patterns in substitution frequencies, it was shown that the r
i,j variation is subjected to two distinct, short-range  and long-range , effects  <cit> . in the equation above, the short-range effect is captured through the δri,jsr term and mainly describes the totality of the intrinsic properties and sequence-dependent interactions of dna with overall mutagenic and reparation processes in a given organism  <cit> . the better-studied substitution patterns at a cpg context  are separated in the δri,jcpg term, since besides having a specific short-range dyad context, the cpg mutations underlying the δri,jcpg substitution term also depend on a number of regional factors that alter the epigenetic targeting of the cpg sites . many relatively recent studies provide essential insights into the δri,jlr variation caused by the regional effects that depend on a long-range  sequence context through general mechanisms, such as recombination and gc-biased gene conversion , transcription-coupled biased genome repair  <cit>  and instability  <cit> , chromatin-organisation-  <cit>  and replication-associated mutational bias  <cit>  and inhomogeneous repair  <cit> , differential dna mismatch repair  <cit> , non-allelic gene conversion  <cit> , and male mutation bias  <cit> . the term δri,jgene captures the change in substitution rates in genes and other functional elements under elevated selection bias and may reflect observations such as the increased neutral substitution rates in exons  <cit>  and the possible reduction of mutation rates in the x-chromosome  <cit> . δri,jspec holds the highly specific increase or decrease in substitution rates governed by a strong selection or targeted underlying hyper- and hypomutations  <cit>  present, for example, in the genes of immune system, and may additionally include other effects not captured in prior terms.

herein, we propose a methodology to obtain the core components  of the neutral single-nucleotide substitution rates via the direct analysis of  <dig>  l <dig> mobile dna remnants  <cit>  in the same, human, genome . 
  <dig> ri,jcore=ri,jsb+δri,jsr 


our transposon exposed k-mer rate  method provides the ri,jcore rate constants at single-nucleotide resolution in l <dig>  where we demonstrate sufficient sequence variability to cover a wide-range of sequence contexts. we use this coverage to determine the core rate constants for all possible nucleotide substitutions  at each of the  <dig>  billion positions in the human genome. the trek aims at revealing the ri,jcore variation in a relatively model-free manner and at a level beyond accounting for only the two immediate neighbouring nucleotides  <cit> . we make our dataset of the time-dependent rate constants for individual substitutions publicly available. to exemplify the usage of trek data, we demonstrate that the ri,jcore values can generate a sequence starting from a random dna sequence, whose key features are in better agreement with the short-range oligomeric organisation of the human genome. we next calculate the basal substitution propensity profile of the human genome, evaluating the core predisposition to single-nucleotide substitutions. we outline the decreased frequency of the sequence motifs that are stable in germline among the sites linked to somatic cancer mutations.

RESULTS
revealing the core single-nucleotide substitution rates
the repetitive occurrence of mobile dna elements in different regions within the same genome  <cit>  provides the opportunity to obtain the ri,jcore  rate constants that account for the δri,jsr immediate effects of neighbouring nucleotides. after the initial inactivation at different time epochs , individual remnants of many transposon subfamilies within a genome have been subjected to largely the same overall mutagenic and repair conditions as the rest of the genome  <cit> , hence can also serve as markers of ri,jcore neutral substitution rates applicable to genomic sites that share the immediate sequence-context. for the purpose of this study, we have used the hominoid lineage of the l <dig>  retrotransposons, spanning  <dig>  to  <dig>  myr  of age  <cit> . the constituent subfamilies of the lineage are l1pa <dig>  l1pa <dig>  l1pa <dig>  l1pa <dig> and the most recent l1hs. their respective age and the number of insertions in the human genome are presented in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  the choice was made through the following reasoning. the l <dig> elements have a long  sequence without extended repeats like in the ltr  elements  <cit> . this enables their robust mapping on a chosen template and provides essential local sequence variability around different nucleotide positions within l <dig> elements. there are distinct l <dig> subfamilies that were active at different time epochs, with detailed molecular clock analyses available  to reveal and, importantly, validate the age of each subfamily. they are well-represented and, unlike other classes of transposable elements, are uniformly scattered across mostly the intergenic regions of the human genome  <cit> , and are less prone to recombination and context bias  <cit> . the young l <dig> subfamilies have most of their remnants coming from the genomic regions with g+c content close to the genomic average value . unlike sines  and ltrs, line sites show a very low level of rna polymerase enrichment, as a marker of transcriptional association, in normal tissues  <cit> . the selected most-recent subfamilies are sufficiently young  <cit>  a) to enable an unambiguous identification of the genomic coordinates of the borders for the remnants; b) to assume that each position in those elements would be unlikely to undergo repeated substitutions over the studied period of their existence as remnants in the human genome ; c) to attribute a time-invariance to the rates during the analysed period of mutation accumulation  <cit> . finally, many matching positions in our studied five l <dig> representatives share the same consensus bases, hence, such positions are not polymorphic due to adaptive pressure and can serve as internal references for inferring the ri,jcore rates.

the trek methodology of obtaining ri,jcore rates, along with the considerations for filtering out the possible selection and non-neutral substitution sites, is presented in fig.  <dig> with further details in methods, figures s <dig> and s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  the acquired data on the full set of position-specific substitution rates are presented in fig.  <dig>  to highlight the revealed variation per substitution type, along with the fully averaged values for the rate constants.
fig.  <dig> single genome determination of the context-dependent substitution rate constants. a–d the trek approach is applicable to a genome containing multiple remnants of retrotransposon subfamilies silenced at different time epochs . we can consider those subfamilies as substitution counters that had different resetting ages . the full consensus sequence of the most recent subfamily is taken as a reference . the remnants are then grouped by their age and fully mapped onto the reference sequence . for each position i in the reference sequence, the fractions of the four bases in all the time groups are calculated . the comparison of these fractions coming from individual base types across different time periods enables a linear model fitting, through which we can reveal the rates for the substitutions into the b
 <dig>  b
 <dig> and b
 <dig> bases from the consensus  state of the given position . the steps  and  are repeated for all the positions in the reference sequence, producing single-nucleotide resolution core substitution rate constants with sequence-context dependency as sampled in the reference sequence of the mobile element. to assure the high quality and neutrality of the retrieved rates, we accounted for the sites in the reference sequence that had at least  <dig> mapped occurrences in each time group , with the same wild-type variant being always the prevalent one  in each subfamily  and producing a pearson’s correlation coefficient of at least  <dig>  in the time-evolution plots 


fig.  <dig> transposon exposed  ri,jcore substitution rate constants of the human genome. the boxplots are shown for each i→j substitution type inferred from the hominoid l <dig> remnants spread across the human genome. each point comes from a specific position in the l <dig> element, reflecting the substitution rate constant averaged across multiple occurrences of that specific position with the same sequence-context in multiple regions of the human genome. the complementary i→j pairs are plotted in adjacency. the median values of the overall substitution rates  in byr − <dig>  unit, averaged across the varying sequence-context within the l <dig> elements, are shown on the top




a total of  <dig> positions, at the 3’ side of the l <dig> elements, passed our robustness checks  and were thus employed to infer the corresponding ri,jcore values from the analysis of all the young l <dig> remnants in the human genome. we recorded the data in the trek database that contains a set of well-defined ri,jcore constants  capturing the influence of the unique arrangement of neighbouring nucleotides at those positions. owing to the nature of the selected l <dig> elements, as discussed above, and the trek procedure design , we expect the absence of the δri,jgene contribution, the elimination of δri,jlr at the averaging stage  and the removal of the δri,jcpg and δri,jspec effects through our robustness checks embedded within the trek procedure . therefore, our method provides the ri,jcore=ri,jsb+δri,jsr core variation  of the substitution rates at around the ri,jsb genomic average values for each i→j base substitution. if the above is correct and trek indeed results in ri,jcore values, further averaging of the core ri,jsb+δri,jsr rates  should give us the single-base ri,jsb genomic average substitution rates, cancelling out the remaining δri,jsr contribution. in fact, the comparisons of our trek-derived ri,jsb with two published datasets that reflect on the genomic average ri,jsb rates  <cit>  show an excellent correlation  confirming the absence of any biased averaging and unusual substitution rates in the time-accumulated substitutions at the l <dig> sites that pass the trek procedure. the genome simulation, described later in this work, provides an additional validation for our rate constants. the ri,jcore values  for all possible i→j neutral substitutions inferred for each of the eligible individual l <dig> positions are thus assumed to be common for any other sites in the human genome that share the short-range sequence context.

the influence range of neighbour nucleotides
to apply the ri,jcore constants to the human genome, we first established the optimal length of a dna sequence  capturing most of the influences that modulate substitution rates of the base at the centre. for this, we evaluated the power of the knowledge of the neighbouring arrangement of nucleotides in predicting the ri,jcore constants for each of the twelve i→j substitution types, where i and j are the four dna bases. we built test predictors for individual substitution types via a tree-based gradient boosting machine   <cit> , while using varying lengths of sequences centred at the positions where the rate constants were to be predicted . the aim of the machine learning procedure was to establish the optimal sequence length to minimise the error in the predicted rate constants . in agreement with prior evidence  <cit> , but now obtained for each individual i→j substitution type from trek data, the optimal window was found to be 5-7-nt  and was subsequently used as guidance for the direct mapping of the trek rate constants from the l <dig> sequence onto any given human nuclear dna sequence for the ri,jcore assignment.

mapping the trek ri,jcore data on any dna sequence
the upper 7-nt size window for determining the single-nucleotide substitution rate constants at the central base accounts for three upstream and three downstream bases relative to each nucleotide position. our neutral substitution positions that pass the trek criteria capture  <dig> unique 7-mers out of the possible  <dig>  . therefore, for many loci in the human genome we need to use a smaller window  as a match criterion to assign to one of the trek rate constant sets. by trimming the size of the k-mer to five, hence accounting for two upstream and two downstream bases, we cover  <dig> unique sequences out of possible  <dig> . further reduction of the size to three, allows having data for  <dig> unique triads out of  <dig> . for the single-base case , where we average out all short-range neighbour effects and longer-range sequence variability, we obtain data for all the four bases and 4× <dig> possible substitutions as shown in fig.  <dig> . the coverage of the longer k-mers is, however, increased nearly twice when we account for the strand-symmetry, as described in methods. please note, that for each unique k-mer we obtained three ri,jcore constants via the described analysis of a large pool of l <dig> remnants from different genomic loci.

with the above considerations, we created a program  to produce ri,jcore core substitution rate constants for any sequence, accounting for the context information within up to the 7-mer window and pulling the matching core data from the trek database. should a representative match be absent with the full 7-nt long sequence, the window around the given position in a query sequence is shortened into the longest variant possible  with a full match in the trek database . in this way, for all the possible  <dig>  7-mers, our trek database reports  <dig>  rate constants , of which  <dig>  account for the 7-mer context,  <dig>   account for the nested 5-mer context,  <dig>   for 3-mer and only  <dig>  constants do not account for any context effect on the central base . our full dataset reports and makes publicly available , the time-dependent ri,jcore rates for all individual i→j substitutions accounting for the context effects beyond the  <dig> triads  <cit> . if we consider only the unique values in the trek database, we report  <dig> unique rate constants , of which  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  entries account for 7-, 5-, 3- and 1-mer contexts respectively. the 1-mer averaged data were used for only the k-mers that contain either c or g bases of a cpg dyad at the centre, to assign the overall substitution rate constants by the trek mapper. this was done since none of the cpg sites in the l <dig> remnants passed our robustness checks , due to the targeted, epigenetic-  or apobec-affected single-nucleotide substitutions there . the latter effects were likely to be non-uniform with time  and may had been present in order to silence the active retrotransposons.

our current data are for the human nuclear genome. however, the general approach for obtaining ri,jcore constants is applicable to any organism where the genome contains a set of well-characterised and related young mobile elements silenced at different time epochs and without notable genomic context bias.

ri,jcore rates and the oligomeric composition of the human genome
the full set of sequence-dependent human ri,jcore substitution rates  enabled us to perform a sophisticated in silico evolution of a random dna sequence, guided solely by our ri,jcore values. we started from a random sequence of  <dig> million  nt with a g+c content of 60% . we performed random nucleotide substitutions weighted by trek-inferred probabilities , where, after each cycle, the substitution rate constants were updated for the sequence positions that were either mutated or fell within the influence zone of the performed substitutions. the simulation was continued until the overall g+c content of the simulated sequence became constant .
fig.  <dig> comparison of the in silico evolved sequence and the actual human genome. a the 5-mln-nt starting sequence is randomly generated with 60% g+c content.  the sequence is then neutrally evolved using ri,jcore only, until the base-compositional equilibrium is established . this was reached after about  <dig> mln substitutions , where x-axis shows the number of substitutions divided by the simulated sequence length). the equilibration converges faster when we start from a sequence with lower g+c content. d–g the plots showing the correlation of the k-mer contents in the equilibrated genome with the corresponding content in the real human genome. the lengths of the k-mers along with the correlation coefficients are shown on the bottom right corners of the plots. two correlation coefficients are shown with the exclusion and the inclusion  of cpg containing oligomers . the dashed lines depict the diagonals for the ideal match of the k-mer contents




the simulation converged to generate a sequence with the a, t, g and c compositions of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively. note, that these values are close to the a, t, g and c compositions of the repeat-masked human genome of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively , being slightly at rich. furthermore, the simulated sequence captures the contents of different individual oligomers  in the human genome. the data for all the possible  <dig> dyads,  <dig> triads,  <dig>  pentads and  <dig>  heptads are presented in fig. 4
d–g and show a significant  correlation between the compositional landscapes of the trek-simulated sequence and the actual human genome. regardless of the starting composition of the initial dna sequences, our simulations always equilibrated to a state with similar oligomer  content. the k-mer contents shown in fig. 4
d–g for the actual human genome were calculated from the repeat-masked version of the refseq human genome, where all the identified repeat elements, including the l <dig>  were disregarded. this assured the removal of a potential bias due to the presence of l <dig> elements , used to infer the rate constants, in the human genome. as ri,jcore constants are free of the δri,jcpg contribution , the simulated genome produced higher alterations in representing the k-mer contents that have cpgs . these alterations visually demonstrate the role of δri,jcpg in the background compositional landscape of the human genome. the correlations in fig.  <dig> are from simulations where the rate constants were symmetrised according to the inherent strand-symmetry in double-helical dna . the results without such equalisation are still significant, though producing slightly worse correlation coefficients .

to confirm that the observed correlations for different k-mer contents  present an improvement due to our sequence-context-dependent rates, rather than being a side effect, by a pure chance, in a sequence where the simulation makes only the single-base composition converge to that of the real human genome , we calculated the expected distribution of different k-mers in a genome with fully random base arrangement but with the exact human a, t, g and c overall base composition. in the complete absence of any sequence-context effects, the probability of the occurrence  of any k-mer in a sufficiently long sequence is equal to the product of the occurrence probabilities of their constituent bases. for instance, the probability of observing the agt triad is the p
agt=p
a
p
g
p
t product, where the individual p
i probabilities are the base contents expressed in fractions. the comparison of the k-mer fractions obtained in this way with the human genome data  shows a substantially reduced correlation . the discrepancies are minimal while accounting for only the dyad and therefore singleton contents, however, while using context-invariant singleton substitution rates in the simplistic in silico simulations descried above, we observe slight but systematic underestimation of the overall g+c content in the sequence at compositional equilibrium . although excluded via the specificities of the trek methodology , to completely rule out the presence of any circularity in the reproduction of the human genome higher k-mer  content through the trek rate constants, we also demonstrated the overall poor agreement between the k-mer contents of l <dig> elements used to infer the rate constants and the human nuclear genome .
fig.  <dig> oligomeric composition of the ideal neighbour-invariant sequence. a–d the oligomeric content of the human genome  is compared to the content expected by chance  in a sequence that has the exact single-base composition as the human genome, but has substitution rates that are purely context independent. this corresponds to a hypothetic genome simulation with perfectly correct ri,jsb single-base rate constants, but without any δri,jsr sequence-context dependency present. the lengths of the k-mers, along with the pearson’s correlation coefficients without and with  the cpg containing oligomer data  are shown on the bottom right corners of the plots. the correlation coefficients are notably smaller compared to the in silico sequence, equilibrated based on the full set of context-dependent trek ri,jcore constants. the dashed lines depict the diagonals for the ideal match of the k-mer contents


fig.  <dig> g+c content equilibration of random sequences with  <dig> and 30% initial g+c contents. here, the in silico genome is equilibrated by using either the trek ri,jcore constants with up-to 7-mer context dependence , or only the singleton rates from trek without any context dependence . the simulation accounting for the context dependence results in  <dig>  and  <dig> % of g+c content , starting from random sequences with 60% and 30% g+c contents respectively. the simulation with only the singleton rates converged at lower  <dig> % value for the g+c content, where we expected the least disagreement between the “most-ideal” singleton vs. 7-mer description of the substitution rates . please note, that in the hypothetic case of the most ideal singleton substitution rate constants, the discrepancy is more pronounced while analysing the genomic contents of the higher k-mers, as presented in fig. 5





the described simulations therefore support the attribution of a contributory role that the ri,jcore variability plays in shaping the compositional landscape of the human nuclear genome  <cit> . importantly, our study demonstrates that the non-specific core substitution rates are capable of producing apparent selection or depletion patterns in higher k-mers, beyond dyads, in the human genome. to this end, the 7-mer content from our in silico equilibrated sequences, obtained solely based on the set of ri,jcore constants, can serve as a background standard to reveal specific selection  <cit>  for or against different sequence motifs in the human genome.

similar link between the context-dependent mutation pressure and the nucleotide composition has recently been shown for the triad counts in the bacterial genome of mesoplasma forum  <cit>  and in the human mitochondrial genome  <cit> . interestingly, the latter study employed the somatic mutation propensities found by analysing cancer genomes to reproduce the triad count of the human mitochondrial genome, as an evidence of the link between the somatic and germline mutation rates in human mitochondria. that link is further visible in the cancer analysis presented here  for the human nuclear genome.

basal substitution propensity profile of the human genome, substitution prone and resistant motifs
trek mapper provides the full set of ri,jcore constants for each position in the whole human genome. such data enables us to calculate the germline context-dependent basal substitution propensity  by taking the sum of the individual rate constants for the three possible substitutions at each base position, thus producing the core ri,ncore constant for the substitution of a given base i by any other base n. figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig> shows the bsp profiles calculated for the individual chromosomes  as compared with the whole genome profile , where most of the chromosomes exhibit the same overall distribution as the whole genome. further grouping and analysis  <cit>  of the unique sequences found in regions of different bsp for the whole human genome reveals motifs with varying substitution propensities of the bases at the centre of 7-mers . in particular, adhering to the standard nucleobase notation in small letters , the comparative examinations of the sequences reveal the overall stability of c in the wntcnwn context, and analogously, g in the nwnganw context. those bases become prone to substitutions, independently from the well-studied cpg context, in the nmrcarn and nytgykn motifs for the c and g bases respectively. furthermore, a and t bases become prone to more frequent substitutions in the ncwatnn and analogous ngwtann motifs .
fig.  <dig> sequence-context dependence of the ri,ncore basal substitution propensity  constants. a–h sequence logos  <cit>  are shown for all the unique 7-mer sequences grouped by the central base type  and the category of the bsp range the sequences fall in . the y-axes in the individual sequence logos show the information content in bits. the x-axes outline the neighbouring base positions relative to the central base. for each sequence, the bsp of the central base  depicts the sum of the core rate constants for the substitutions to the three other  bases, ri,ncore=ri,b2core+ri,b3core+ri,b4core. as can be seen from the plots, the bases a and t are highly mutable when the neighbouring positions are enriched in the same, a and t, bases . the adjacent enrichment in a increases the bsp of c , and decreases the bsp of g  bases. conversely, the adjacent enrichment in t increases the bsp of g  and decreases that of c  bases. note, that our data are for ri,ncore, thus independent from the methylation-driven increased mutation rates in cpg dyads 




basal substitution propensity profile and cancer-linked somatic mutations
a recent study, which correlated the cancer and cell division frequencies, suggested that cancers, with their multi-etiologic nature, are linked to random mutation events upon cell division/dna replication  <cit> , in addition to expressing unique type-dependent mutational signatures  <cit> . to this end, genomic sites with higher intrinsic bsp  may potentially exhibit a higher prevalence of cancer-related genome alterations, as compared to sites of lower intrinsic bsp , should the germline and cancer-linked somatic mutations share common mechanisms  <cit> . although the sequence context signatures of cancer mutations and their variation across different cancer types is out of the scope of the present work and is covered in detail elsewhere , here we examined the simple relationship between our calculated germline bsp values and the observed cancer-associated somatic mutations accessed via the annotated cosmic database of somatic mutations in cancer  <cit>  . since the trek data are for the core neutral substitutions, we restricted the analysis to the non-coding and non-polymorphic  point mutations  in cancer. by mapping these sites to the human genome and retrieving the sequence-context information , we processed the data with trek mapper and obtained the bsp  profile for the non-coding sites detected in human cancer. the outcome in figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  overlapped with the whole-genome bsp profile, shows that stable sites in the human genome, assigned by the trek mapper to have ri,ncore below  <dig>  byr − <dig>  are significantly less likely to undergo somatic mutations in cancer. like many other disease-causing mutation sites  <cit> , most of the sites that are highly enriched in cancer  are cpgs  <cit> , which, even without accounting for the methylation driven increase  of the mutation rates, show high basal mutability  <cit> . however, figure s12b, c in additional file  <dig> demonstrates the discussed trend in the 7-mer cancer enrichment ratio  vs. bsp dependence even when all the cpg sites are removed from the analysis. furthermore, while investigating the same relationship in different varieties of cancer  we can see that the trend is mostly in place for the  <dig> cancer types where we have enough data on non-coding somatic mutations , with the only exception being the oesophageal carcinoma . the latter deviation might stem from the greater role of carcinogen driven mechanisms of somatic mutations in a tissue  more exposed to external carcinogens.
fig.  <dig> enrichment of 7-mers with varying bsps in somatic mutation sites linked to different cancer types. a–k each point in the plots corresponds to a unique 7-mer sequence. all the 7-mers that had either c or g of a cpg dyad at the centre were excluded from the plots representing the zoomed  <cit>  byr − <dig> range of bsps. the plots  show data from  <dig> cancer types, with their primary tissue and primary cancer types indicated at the top-right corner of each plot. the red lines in  represent the lowess  <cit>  smoothing fits, outlining the decrease of the cancer enrichment ratio with the decrease in bsp. the numbers at the top-left corners of the plots show the slopes of the linear fits  for the data points below the  <dig>  byr − <dig> , where the depletion of stable k-mers is the most pronounced. the linear model slopes coming from all  <dig> cancer types are shown in  for comparing the extent of the cancer enrichment ratio vs. bsp dependence across the analysed cancer types




overall, the results show that the intrinsic bsp of different sites in dna may contribute to their absence/presence in pathological genotypes. in particular, we observe that 7-mers with low germline bsps of the central base are relatively depleted in cancer-linked somatic mutation data . they present a cancer enrichment ratio that is smaller than  <dig>  whereas for the unstable 7-mers, the enrichment ratio, on average, tends to  <dig>  meaning that their presence in cancer is overall comparable to the one in the whole genome. focusing on the average trend  that does not expand to the k-mers with >  <dig> cancer enrichment ratio, we cannot comment about the behaviour of the sites of higher mutability in cancer by the present work. those could potentially be better reflected in the cancer mutational signature analyses done by others  <cit> . our results, however, further outline the potential role of the general imbalance in repair machinery in determining the accumulation of somatic mutations in cancer, where the mutations are originally caused by errors in replication that possibly emerge via mechanisms more or less common in somatic and germline cells  <cit> .

the relation between the trek ri,jcore and germline mutation rates
since the rates of point mutations can be indirectly estimated by determining the rates at which neutral substitutions accumulate in a genome  <cit> , , and, we have applied stringent criteria for filtering out l <dig> positions with a potential to be non-neutral, our trek ri,jcore substitution rate constants may serve as contributory estimates for germline mutation rates . the trek method complements previous studies on the germline mutation rates  <cit> , and retrieves rate constants  in a single genome manner, where all the detected substitutions in l <dig> remnants  retrieved from a single genome have accumulated while evolving in multiple  copies within a lineage of a single organism. this may have a potential to minimise fixation biases and further eliminate biases attributed to the change  in background mutagenic and reparatory machineries, from an individual to individual, when comparing data from multiple genomes. taking into account the singleton composition of the unmasked human genome  and the ri,jsb constants for the individual transitions and transversions brought in fig.  <dig>  as estimated through trek method, we can provide a new estimate for the overall germline mutation rate for the human genome to be  <dig>  mutations per site per billion year for the used reference human genome. this makes  <dig> ×10− <dig> mutations per site per generation, assuming  <dig> years of average generation span  <cit> . interestingly, the value is slightly lower than the ∼  <dig> ×10− <dig> estimate  <cit>  based on phylogenetic-based approaches, which can be attributed to the more aggressive elimination of biases built in the trek design . however, the estimate is still greater than the more recent  <dig> ×10− <dig> to  <dig> ×10− <dig> evaluations from pedigree-based studies , known to be free from background recombination influence but highly dependent on the paternal age  <cit> . less so for the relative values of the rates for individual base-conversions, we expect the absolute values in trek to be dependent on the absolute timing of the used five subfamilies of l <dig> elements. although the latter reliance may be the cause of the relatedness of the trek estimate to the phylogeny-based ones, our estimate is still a useful addition to the ongoing debate on calibrating the average germline mutation rates .

CONCLUSIONS
we have employed a single-genome approach  that reveals the core  component of the spontaneous single-nucleotide substitution rates and basal substitution propensity constants  for the human nuclear genome . although the mobile dna elements have been used before  <cit>  for estimating averaged substitution rates, the increased quality of the human reference sequence and the detailed subfamily divergence studies for the l <dig> elements  done during the past decade enabled the construction of a specific direct method for the single-genome retrieval of the core ri,jcore rate constants at a single-nucleotide resolution, while also accounting for the comprehensive short-range context effects beyond the previous estimates for the +1/- <dig> base effects  <cit> . the retrieval of our ri,jcore data in a single-genome manner adds additional value, since it ensures the absence of potential bias present a) in the comparison of the genomes of different species due to the differences in the molecular machinery  that influence the overall mutation rates, and b) in the snp-counting based methods that rely on sites where the visible polymorphism may contain significant selection bias.

our context-dependent rate constants were then used to drive the equilibration of a random dna sequence . the resulting dna had k-mer  contents in better agreement with those of the human genome, as compared to the analogous contents from the calculations based on the singleton substitution rates. the calculated basal substitution propensities revealed motifs that are prone or resistant to substitutions , and confirmed the presence of a link between core substitution rates in the germline and the somatic mutations in cancer, outlining possible commonalities in the mechanisms of mutations at both levels . the discussed parallel between the trek ri,jcore substitution rates and the germline mutations makes the observed link with the somatic mutations, inferred from a cancer database, be more logical.

we have become aware of a recently published parallel study  <cit> , where the authors revealed the context-dependent mutation probabilities by analysing the variation reflected in the multiple genomes of the  <dig> genomes project  <cit> . by arriving to the caat mutable motif  and outlining the importance of the heptameric context  in explaining the mutational patterns, the work provided means to additionally validate part of our results by completely different means. appealingly, the trek method retrieves rate constants  in a single genome manner . besides the potential minimisation of fixation biases, this may provide an opportunity to detect some of the biases attributed to the change  in background mutagenic and repair machineries, from individual to individual, when comparing two or more genomes. in particular, fig.  <dig> demonstrates that neutral substitution probabilities may be elevated in one population as compared to the other. the difference was detectable owing to the multi-genomic analyses within each population done in  <cit> . trek may thus serve as a single-genome independent and complementary method to assess inter-individual and inter-population variation of the substitution rates, and retrieve the context-dependent rates for species with only single sequenced genome available.
fig.  <dig> agreement between the 7-mer context-dependent trek rate constants , determined in a single-genome manner, and the context-dependent substitution probabilities from the  <dig> genomes project. a–c the correlation plots are shown for the substitution probabilities inferred  <cit>  from three different  populations  <cit> . only 7-mers with data present in both works were used for the comparisons. overall, the plots highlight the good agreement between the two methods, and show the variation in substitution probabilities across different populations. this variation may be caused by genetic differences in those populations affecting genes/proteins involved in the background mutagenic and repair machineries, thus altering the spontaneous mutation rates




the extended set of core substitution rate constants and the associated program we report may enrich our resources and potentially help advance our understanding of genome dynamics, with possible implications for the role of random substitutions in the emergence of pathological genotypes and the neutral evolution of proteomes.
