BACKGROUND
drought at the flowering stage produces infertile pollen in maize   <cit> , resulting in substantially lower yield. a shorter anthesis-to-silking interval  was observed under drought in a lowland tropical maize population  <cit> , and the interval was considered to be an indirect selection criterion for grain yield  <cit> . grain yield, a complex trait dependent on several environmental factors  <cit> , was increased through genetic modifications despite stress  <cit> .

several researchers have identified drought-related genes in different tissues that regulate molecular and physiological responses under stress . in the ears and silks of maize, some genomic regions that control the levels of abscisic acid  and sugar showed the signal transduction involved in stress-related pathways and regulated kernel size and productivity of the plant under drought  <cit> . different tissues showed the expression of an nac-transcription-factor-encoding gene  <cit> , which was observed to be strongly associated with the relative ear position, 100-kernel weight, and flowering time across the experimental maize population  <cit> . some drought response has also been recorded recently in reproductive and leaf meristem tissues in maize  <cit> .

furthermore, a high-resolution association map created using a high-density marker set has the potential to unravel stress-associated genetic variability in a genome  <cit> . considerable efforts have been made to understand the association of snps with different phenotypic traits in maize , and strong snp associations have been identified for flowering time  <cit> , kernel shape  <cit> , 100-kernel weight  <cit> , and kernel quality  <cit> . moreover, target genes for crop improvement have been successfully identified using genome-wide association  mapping in maize  <cit> .

in this study, we assembled a gwa mapping panel using elite subtropical maize genotypes and phenotyped it under water stress  at flowering time at multiple locations to identify the snps associated with key agronomic traits. the association of genetic loci with the agronomic traits and their recurrence level across different locations and models were examined, to identify the snps significantly associated with the candidate genes that interact to confer tolerance to ws.

RESULTS
phenotypic data
an association mapping panel of  <dig> subtropical maize lines was subjected to ws and the performance of the stressed maize lines was compared with that of the lines grown under a well-watered  environment. the panel was phenotyped for anthesis-to-silking interval , ear length , ear girth , kernels per row , the number of kernel rows , 100-kernel weight , and grain yield  at three locations: indian agriculture research institute , new delhi; acharya n g ranga agricultural university , hyderabad; and agricultural research station , karimnagar for two years. the overall performance of the hybrids under ws was significantly impaired . the phenotypic correlation coefficient showed that gy and the traits contributing to it were positively and significantly correlated with each other, and asi was negatively but significantly correlated with other agronomic traits .

genome-wide association mapping
genome-wide association models
we detected gwa signals from genabel and genome association and prediction integrated tool  models. model fitness varied over the data sets  and an example from genabel is given below. for asi–hyderabad, a higher model  from genabel showed greater fitness than the lower hierarchy models  did. the genomic inflation factor  was  <dig>  in the latter model but was reduced to  <dig>  when admixture was added as a covariate ; q10 + k and q10 + k + admixture from genabel had equal effect on correcting cryptic relationship for asi–karimnagar ; and all the models proved equally good for gy–hyderabad .figure  <dig>

comparison of gwa signals: ww and ws
of  <dig> snps strongly  associated with ws,  <dig> were false-discovery-rate -corrected associations and the rest  were consistent across the data sets . the maximum number  of association signals were identified on chromosome  <dig> followed by those on chromosome  <dig> , whereas chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> shared the least number of significant associations  across traits measured under ws.

genome-wide analysis was also assessed for the ww data sets, which mapped  <dig> significant associations  including  <dig> fdr-corrected associations. the maximum number of gwa signals for ww was contributed by the snps mapped on chromosome  <dig>  followed by those on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , whereas the minimum number  of gwa signals was shared by the snps mapped on chromosome  <dig>  the recurrence of these signals across all data sets  varied with those observed in ws. also the stringency of these results was observed through the number of significantly associated snps for eg trait being  <dig> in ws and  <dig> in ww. but, for traits asi, gy, and kr, the number of gwa signals in ww were equivalent to that in ws. snps significantly associated in both conditions were mapped near both drought tolerant genes and regulatory genes having their importance in both stressed and normal environment–pze- <dig> and pze- <dig> for gy; pze- <dig> for asi and kr; pze- <dig> for asi, gy, and kr. however rest of the snps were also significantly associated in ww and ws but were specific to environmental locations.

gwa signals: ws
on chromosome  <dig>  a significant signal  associated with ws-asi was located 12 kb from the nuclear factor-ya transcription factor  . this snp also showed an fdr-corrected p value of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for ws-asi and was repeated 75% of the times across all data sets  under ws . for asi–new delhi, pze- <dig> was significantly associated  with a stronger p value of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for ws  than that for the non-significant signal observed under ww  . in addition, this locus was co-localized with a quantitative trait locus  earlier mapped for asi by almeida et al
 <cit> . furthermore, significant associations for ws also comprised dnaj-49-like chaperone protein and a domain of unknown function  that were co-localized with two other qtls for asi on chromosome  <dig> under ws  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
significant associations  under water stress observed across agronomic traits and locations. all  <dig> strong associations for ws  that were observed on  <dig> maize chromosomes were pooled over a heat map. the strongly associated snps are appended by their positions on the chromosomes. based on the p values, a heat map was generated for seven agronomic traits – anthesis-to-silking interval , ear girth , ear length , grain yield , 100-kernel weight , kernels per row , and the number of kernel rows  – recorded at three locations and mean of phenotypic data at all locations, and four models  under waters-stressed conditions. out of these  <dig> snp associations,  <dig> were close to the drought-tolerant genes that regulate some molecular and physiological functions leading to drought tolerance .



two fdr-corrected associations for ws-asi, one on chromosome  <dig>  and the other on chromosome  <dig> , were found near a gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor . the first locus identified at 92 kb from bhlh was also significantly associated with ws-gy, -eg, -hkw, -el, -krn, and -kr at specific locations . the second locus, mapped at 118 kb from bhlh, also showed strong associations with ws-hkw, -krn, and -kr  and significant associations for asi across all locations and mean data , while the rest of the traits were confined to specific locations .figure  <dig> 
snps significantly associated for anthesis-to-silking interval and grain yield across all locations and models under water stress. all log10
p values  observed for a data set were pooled over a gwa plot.  six fdr-corrected associations on  <dig> chromosomes were observed for ws-asi specific to locations and models. pze- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> demonstrated strong signals at all locations and models, the most significant  bring for the data set new delhi–m <dig>   eight fdr-corrected associations were observed for ws-gy. four of these were mapped on chromosome  <dig>  with the pze- <dig> and pze- <dig> snps showing strong association across all data sets.



snp pze- <dig> mapped on chromosome  <dig>  indicated strong gwa signals for ws-asi across multiple locations . these signals showed a stronger and significant association under ws than that for ww, in which the p values were less significant and less repeatable. this snp was mapped 30 kb from a stress-related gene encoding nadp-malic enzyme .

snps mapped on chromosome  <dig> showed five fdr-corrected association signals for ws-gy : three snps  were consistent across all locations, whereas two  were specific to the locations and models . of these five snps, three  were clustered in a 131 kb region, which enclosed genes encoding myb-related  transcription factor and squamous promoter binding protein  transcription factor . this cluster was identified 65% of the times across all ws data sets, including gy , and showed strong associations with ws-gy that were more recurrent across locations and models than those in the ww data sets. in addition to this, two fdr-corrected snps  on chromosome  <dig> were also strongly associated with ws-gy. the first snp was mapped nearer to the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and an ethylene responsive factor  transcription factor, and the second was close to the bhlh encoding gene . another snp on chromosome  <dig>  16 kb from the myb, was also associated with ws-gy . all snps on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> also had a significant association with ws-eg .

two snps on chromosome  <dig>  mapped close to a gene encoding a c2h2-type zinc finger  transcription factor were independently associated for ws-asi and -gy when measured at hyderabad. the first snp , 31 kb from c2h <dig>  showed a strong association  for ws-asi. the second snp , 7 kb from c2h <dig>  was associated with a strong signal  for ws-gy , which was non-significant under ww. also, snps mapped on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  were associated with both ws-asi and -gy  where the association of the first locus with asi was more significant in ws than that in non-significant signals observed under ww at hyderabad. the first locus was mapped near the genes encoding myb, a bzip transcription factor, and a zinc finger-homeodomain  transcription factor, and the second was near bhlh .

for ws-hkw, four strong gwa signals were observed on different chromosomes close to the stress-related genes. the first two loci  were observed 12 kb and 20 kb from nf-ya respectively . the third locus , also showing a significant association for ws-hkw , was mapped close to one gene, namely vacuolar proton atpase pump , and two transcription factors, namely nac and calmodulin-binding transcription activator  . the fourth locus  was close to a universal stress protein .

discussion
metabolic mechanisms common to ws and ww conditions
strong gwa signals were detected near the genes responsible for drought tolerance as well as for plant metabolism across both ws and ww environments. this commonality highlights the importance of genes that are responsible for maintaining yield and were associated with yield-related traits under both the environments. two snps  on chromosome  <dig> were strongly associated with gy for both ws  and ww data sets . these snps showed a drought-tolerant erf transcription factor in their vicinity, which promotes aba-dependent stomatal closure under ws  <cit>  . apart from this drought-tolerant gene, these snps also included two more genes encoding mads-box and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , which regulate generalized functions in plants. during root development, the mads-box gene regulates auxin transport  <cit> , cell proliferation  <cit> , the transition to flowering and flower development  <cit> . g3pdh is part of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle system that is induced at different stages of plant development when the demand for redox adjustment is high  <cit> . g3pdh is also one of the enzymes involved in glycerol metabolism, where the role of glycerol in regulating root development through multiple pathways in arabidopsis has been studied recently  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
functional roles of candidate genes associated with drought tolerance. the outermost circle represents the drought-tolerant genes mapped in the present study; the middle circle shows the molecular mechanisms involved in drought tolerance; and the inner circle describes the functional role of the gwa candidate genes that directly lead to drought tolerance.



a strong gwa signal  for asi and krn was identified for both ws  and ww across all data sets although the p value varied with the data set . this association pointed to a drought-tolerant nf-ya transcription factor 12 kb from the snp. under ws, nf-ya promotes aba-dependent stomatal closure, which contributes to drought tolerance  <cit>  . nf-ya is also important to several other functions including male gametogenesis, embryogenesis, and seed development under ww conditions  <cit> . the consistency of these gwa signals shows that nf-ya is important to high yields irrespective of whether if water is scarce or abundant.

another strong gwa signal  was that for asi, gy, and kr across both environments and at all locations. bhlh, a drought-tolerant gene, was mapped close to this snp, and has been known to interact with two other two drought-tolerant genes, bzip and myb, which are responsible for tissue-specific flavonoids production and light responsiveness under normal conditions  <cit> : bzip regulates auxin transport  <cit>  and myb promotes light signalling transductions including photosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana. the importance of these genes under ws was noticed from the specific gwa signals for ws that were mapped close to three drought-tolerant gene families: pze- <dig> near myb, pze- <dig> and syngenta <dig> near bhlh, and pze- <dig> near bzip. apart from drought tolerance, these genes can also interact strongly to regulate other generalized functions, as can be inferred from the gwa signals mapped across both the environments.

mechanisms of drought tolerance
strong gwa signals were recorded near the interacting drought-tolerant genes under ws  . these mechanisms, namely stomatal closure, detoxification signalling, root development, reduced water potential, and flowering, are influenced at different physiological and functional levels and enhance drought tolerance .

stomatal closure
a genomic region encoding two neighbouring snps 253 bp apart  in high linkage disequilibrium    <cit>  was seen on chromosome  <dig>  near two camta regulating factors, the myb and sbp . these snps showed significant p values for several traits including gy, eg, el, and kr under ws . the extended regions with strong ld exhibited a steep selection and genetic drift  <cit>  of those traits in the population. camta was also identified near a locus mapped on chromosome  <dig> that was strongly associated with ws-asi, -eg, -el, -krn, -kr, and -hkw . camta , myb, and sbp  contributed to stomatal closure, which promotes drought tolerance, presumably through strong inter-chromosomal ld. other camta-regulating factors such as wrky and bzip were mapped near an snp  on chromosome  <dig> that was strongly associated with ws-asi, -krn, and -hkw .figure  <dig> 
regional association plot of 1 mb window on chromosome  <dig> showing snps significantly associated for grain yield under water stress across all locations and models. the genomic region included three neighbouring snps  that were strongly associated with grain yield. pze- <dig> and pze- <dig>  in high linkage disequilibrium  showed fdr-corrected associations specific to locations and models. all three snps were observed close to myb and sbp: 84 kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb from myb and 65 kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb from sbp for pze- <dig>  pze- <dig>  and pze- <dig> respectively.



an snp cluster on chromosome  <dig> with a significant association for ws-gy and -hkw included the genes encoding c2h <dig> and myb . although the function of c2h <dig> in maize is not clear, a c2h2-type zinc finger was shown to play a defensive role in oxidative stress generated under different forms of environmental stress in arabidopsis
 <cit> . moreover, a gene of the myb family is known to integrate aba and auxin signalling under ws  <cit> .

in the present study, two snps were identified, one on chromosome  <dig> and one on chromosome  <dig>  with strong associations for ws-asi and ws-krn  . the snp on chromosome  <dig> encompassed the gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  whereas the one on chromosome  <dig> was localized at a point close to a molybdenum cofactor sulfurase encoding gene . because of possible inter-chromosomal ld, this region may contribute to aba-dependent stomatal closure. this defensive mechanism can be explained by an integrative aba synthesis, accumulation  <cit> , and signalling in guard cells  <cit> . we also identified two snps, one on chromosome  <dig> and another on chromosome  <dig>  close to an nadp-malic enzyme encoding gene , with strong p values for ws-asi and -gy, respectively . this gene promotes stomatal closure, which induces tolerance during ws, by removing malate from guard cells  <cit> .

detoxification signalling
detoxification signalling is a major response to environmental forms of stress, and ws is known to stimulate oxidative stress in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes  <cit> , thereby leading to the production of reactive oxygen species  that are sensitive to aba-signalling pathways  <cit>  and induce programmed cell death in plants  <cit> . therefore, removal of free oxygen radicals may represent the primary defence mechanism in drought tolerance. glutathione-s-transferase  and glutathione peroxidase , which are responsible for ros homeostasis, change turgor pressure through an aba-mediated pathway  <cit>  in order to sustain the plant under drought. these genes were observed to be strongly associated with ws-gy, -hkw, and -krn , thereby highlighting the role of ros homeostasis under ws .

phospholipid hydrolysis is also known to play a role in detoxification signalling under ws  <cit> . in the present study, a genomic region  encoding phospholipase d  displayed a strong and ws-specific association signal for gy . pld is a signalling messenger that facilitates stomatal closure, cell viability, and enhanced root growth during stress  <cit> .

root development
under ws, auxin signalling results in a deeper root system, which increases water use efficiency  <cit> . we noticed two strong association signals in the genomic regions that included the genes for auxin transport  and auxin biosynthesis  on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . these regions showed high p values for ws-asi, -kr, and -hkw, suggesting that maintenance of the root system was in fact associated with flowering and seed development stages.

reduced water potential
vacuolar proton pumps reduce water potential under ws: their expression in the root system enhances water-absorbing efficiency  <cit> . the strong signal of the vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase pump  for ws-krn and that of the v-type atpase h+pump for ws-asi, -eg, -hkw, -el, -krn, and -kr  establish a proton electrochemical gradient across the vacuolar membrane  <cit> , thereby enhancing ion homeostasis, which is responsible for maintaining osmotic balance and in turn, coping with drought .

flowering
drought tolerance also involves changes in flowering through epigenetic mechanisms and the aba-dependent pathway – an observation borne out by the present study  –and dna cytosine methylation and histone modifications  are innate to epigenomes  <cit> . our study identified  <dig> significant snps  close to genes encoding dna-cytosine-5-methyltransferase  and myb transcription factor that are involved in epigenetic mechanisms and aba signalling pathways under ws, thereby pointing to their role in drought tolerance.

functional relationship of stress-responsive genes
interactions of several functional mechanisms associated with drought tolerance are discussed below. epigenetic changes such as dna methylation respond differently at tissue and developmental levels. in a study of the association of methylation-specific sites with drought tolerance, methylation was reduced in response to water stress at the tillering stage whereas drought-induced dna methylation and demethylation were higher at the tillering stage than at the booting and heading stages  <cit> . epigenetic changes in myb, an aba-signalling transcription factor, have been found to be specific to tissues including pericarp and cob in maize  <cit> . these epigenetic changes include site-specific methylation patterns, which have been studied in aba-signalling genes including the myb gene family, where stomatal development genes such as myb <dig> are demethylated and expressed in response to ws  <cit> . myb proteins also promote stamen development and ensure adaptation to ws  <cit> . therefore the epigenetic changes in aba-signalling genes can possibly lead to changes in flowering under ws .

ros are produced in an aba-signalling pathway in which two aba-signalling transcription factors c2h <dig> and mapk are negatively regulated by erf
 <cit> , which is repressed under ws  <cit> . ros are scavenged by a detoxification signalling process  <cit> , in which pld is reported to influence aba responses and opening and closing of stomata through bifurcating pathways  <cit> . when pld activity was studied under water stress, three aba-signalling genes, namely myb, nac , and bhlh, showed differential regulation in both wild-type and antisense-pld arabidopsis
 <cit> . therefore, networking among aba and pld signals is one of the important defensive mechanisms against ws. this suggests that the ros generated by aba signalling are reduced by the interplay between ethylene signalling, aba signalling, and detoxification signalling under ws.

guard cell signal transductions regulate co <dig> influx for photosynthesis as well as water loss through stomatal closure under ws  <cit> : aba signalling promotes the closing of stomata, which reduces co <dig> intake in guard cells and thereby decreases the rate of photosynthesis. to maintain the rate of photosynthesis under ws, plants adopt an alternative pathway for delivering co <dig>  this alternative pathway includes malate degradation, catalyzed by a respiratory enzyme, nadp-malic enzyme, which releases co <dig> as a secondary source for co <dig> influx under ws  <cit> .

aba is a hormone released in response to various forms of abiotic stress and regulates tolerance through a network of interconnected genes. the mechanisms of drought tolerance are stimulated by both aba-dependent and aba-independent pathways: c2h <dig>  for instance, is part of an aba-dependent pathway as well as that of an aba-independent pathway. c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins with erf-associated amphiphilic repression  motifs have been reported to be responsive to aba  <cit>  and to ws  <cit> .these findings suggest that aba and ethylene interact under drought and enhance tolerance by promoting stomatal closure. under ws, c2h <dig> acts as a transcriptional regulator through an aba-independent pathway  <cit> : aba-independent c2h <dig> triggers the genes that are related to h2o <dig> homeostasis and thus decreases the amount of h2o <dig> in guard cells  <cit> . however, stomatal closure as part of the drought response is promoted by aba and h2o <dig> accumulation in guard cells  <cit> .

the electrochemical gradient generated by the proton pump  promotes the secondary active transport of sugar molecules  into the vacuole. this helps the plant in maintaining its internal water balance  <cit> . in addition, the proton pump has also been reported in roots  <cit> , which suggest that this pump regulates water balance in roots and thus contributes to drought tolerance. it is well understood that the water balance in plants is interrelated to root development, where the auxin-inducible genes that promote root development are regulated by the c2h2
 <cit> . this suggests that the integration of root development and aba signalling molecule c2h <dig> allows the maintenance of an electrochemical gradient in the plant.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide association analysis, using multiple locations and two models, identified snps from agronomic traits linked with the genes directly or indirectly associated with drought tolerance in subtropical maize lines. these genes uncovered physiological responses and molecular mechanisms related to drought tolerance. genes governing several functional traits were identified, including stomatal closure, reduced water potential, root development, signalling pathways, and flowering. these genes interact extensively to help the plant cope with drought. snps and their functional association with several drought-responsive genes will be useful in elucidating the mechanism of drought tolerance in subtropical maize.
