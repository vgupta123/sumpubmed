BACKGROUND
medulloblastoma, the most common brain tumor in children  <cit> , develops due to uncontrolled proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors   <cit> . a large body of literature exists regarding the molecular mechanisms of medulloblastoma formation and progression. thus far, four subtypes of medulloblastomas have been identified including the wnt and sonic hedgehog  subgroups  <cit> . medulloblastomas of the shh subgroup have mutations in upstream components of the shh pathway, including the receptors ptch and smo  <cit> . ptch, when bound by shh, relieves its inhibition of smo  <cit>  which then initiates a complex cascade of events leading to cell cycle progression. one example of an established mechanism for shh pathway-dependent cell cycle progression is through the upregulation of cyclins by the proto-oncogene mycn  <cit> . mutation of downstream targets of shh such as gli <dig>  gli <dig>  <cit> , and mycn is a characteristic of medulloblastomas within the shh subtype  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms behind medulloblastoma formation and progression are not completely understood. indeed, recent evidence suggests that a subset of cerebellar granule neurons originate not from gnps but from a population of nestin-expressing progenitors  in the deep external germinal layer and that these neps are more susceptible to shh-dependent tumor formation  <cit> .

previously, our lab identified the transcription factor mxd <dig> as a critical regulator of gnp proliferation during normal cerebellar development as a downstream component of the shh pathway  <cit> . interestingly, we found that mxd <dig> is overexpressed in tumor tissue from the ptch deficient heterozygote mouse model of medulloblastoma  <cit> . moreover, recently we showed that mxd <dig> is upregulated in human medulloblastomas and is required for the proliferation of the human medulloblastoma cell line daoy  <cit> . these results suggest a role for mxd <dig> in medulloblastoma in humans. the daoy cell line was established from a medulloblastoma tumor mass obtained from a  <dig> year old patient  <cit> . tissue from this tumor had evidence of both neural and glial differentiation; however, these characteristics were lost during the establishment of daoy as a cancer cell line  <cit> .

mxd <dig> is a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper  transcription factor that is part of the myc/max/mxd transcriptional network  <cit> . within this network, myc and mxd family members compete with each other for max heterodimerization to invoke opposing transcriptional regulation of target genes  <cit> . specifically, myc and max heterodimers recruit transcriptional activators  <cit>  while mxd and max heterodimers recruit transcriptional repressors  <cit> . myc family members have been shown to promote while mxd family members have been shown to repress cell cycle progression  <cit> . mxd <dig>  however, is an atypical member of the mxd family as it has been found to be expressed during the s-phase of the cell cycle  <cit>  while other mxd family members are expressed in differentiated cells  <cit> . knockdown of mxd <dig> leads to a reduction in cell number suggesting that mxd <dig> is required for cell cycle progression  <cit> . on the other hand, overexpression of mxd <dig> is sufficient to promote proliferation in mouse cerebellar gnps  <cit> . consistent with these results, overexpression of mxd <dig> negatively regulates differentiation in mouse b cells derived from the spleen  <cit> . persistent overexpression of mxd <dig>  however, in mouse gnps and in human medulloblastoma cells results in decreased proliferation due to the activation of apoptosis  <cit> .

to characterize mxd <dig> overexpression in a time dependent manner, we engineered the daoy cell line to express stably a fusion protein between the truncated estrogen receptor and mxd <dig> . in contrast to endogenous mxd <dig>  which is localized to the nucleus  <cit> , under baseline conditions the er-mxd <dig> fusion protein is enriched in the cytoplasm. upon treatment of 4-hydroxytamoxifen  the er-mxd <dig> fusion protein translocates into the nucleus allowing for the timed activation of mxd <dig>  here we show that the nuclear translocation of er-mxd <dig> initially leads to a transient increase in cell proliferation based on bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation but ultimately results in an overall decrease in cell number. furthermore, we identify candidate mxd <dig> regulated genes upon acute induction and long-term expression to investigate the opposing activities of mxd <dig> in the regulation of cellular proliferation in daoy cells.

RESULTS
er-mxd <dig> translocates into the nucleus upon 4-oht treatment
we have previously shown that mxd <dig> knock-down reduced proliferation of daoy medulloblastoma cells, while persistent overexpression also decreased cellular proliferation  <cit> . to distinguish between mxd3’s acute versus long-term effects in daoy medulloblastoma cells, we developed 4-oht inducible cell lines that express mxd <dig> as a fusion to a portion of the mouse estrogen receptor . furthermore, we have previously found that mxd <dig> activity is abolished upon mutation of a single amino acid at the 66th position in the basic domain of mxd <dig>   <cit> . the e66d mutation has been shown to disrupt the basic domain binding of other bhlh proteins to the e-box dna sequence in gel shift assays  <cit> . therefore, as a negative control for subsequent experiments, we developed cell lines stably expressing the inducible fusion er-mxd <dig> e66d for comparison.

the fusion protein, er-mxd <dig>  is expected to be expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm  and only translocate to the nucleus  upon 4-oht treatment. we confirmed that our cell lines express the respective fusion proteins, er-mxd <dig> or er-mxd <dig> e66d  with no observable degradation or cleavage products  by immunoblot. furthermore, the fusion proteins translocate into the nucleus within  <dig> hour of 4-oht treatment by immunocytochemistry . under vehicle treatment, the fusion protein is present in the cytoplasm as expected but some protein is present in the nucleus . this result can be explained by an inherent leakiness within the system or by the presence of trace amounts of an analog of estrogen within the culture media or the cells themselves. we also observe similar results in immunoblotting experiments after biochemical fractionation of nuclear and cytoplasmic components of lysates from our inducible cell lines . despite this leakiness, based on the enriched nuclear staining pattern of the fusion protein under 4-oht conditions  and the relative localization to the nuclear fraction , the system can be used for the timed induction of mxd <dig> transcriptional activity upon nuclear translocation. this timed activation allows for the observation of both immediate and long-term effects of mxd <dig> activation.

mxd <dig> activation results in a transient increase in brdu incorporation followed by a decrease in cell counts
mxd <dig> has been shown to increase gnp proliferation as measured by brdu incorporation  <cit> . to characterize mxd <dig> in daoy cells in a time dependent manner, we used our stable cell lines in proliferation assays in which we measured brdu incorporation in response to mxd <dig> activation . two-way anova analysis reveals that there is a significant difference between ethanol vs. 4-oht treatment in the er-mxd <dig> cell line  but not in the control er-mxd <dig> e66d cell line . bonferroni post-tests show that after  <dig> hours of 4-oht treatment there was a significant increase  in brdu incorporation in the er-mxd <dig> line . this effect peaked at  <dig> hours post treatment with a significant increase  of  <dig> -fold over vehicle in er-mxd <dig>  subsequently, brdu incorporation returns to baseline  levels by  <dig> hours.

as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 4: figure s <dig>  however, long-term mxd <dig> activation results in reduced cell counts, consistent with our previous studies  <cit> . the reduction in cell counts is statistically significant  by two-way anova analysis. bonferroni post-tests reveal that there is a significant difference  by  <dig> days post treatment between 4-oht treated vs. vehicle control . no significant difference was observed between 4-oht and vehicle treated in control er-mxd <dig> e66d   and parental daoy   cell lines, indicating that this effect is specific to the er-mxd <dig> line. furthermore, these results demonstrate that e-box dependent mxd <dig> dna binding is essential for the observed phenotype. er-mxd <dig> cells treated with 4-oht at three times the original seeding density also led to a significant decrease  in cell number by  <dig> hours post-treatment , suggesting that the decrease due to mxd <dig> activation does not depend on seeding density. on the other hand, withdrawal of 4-oht after  <dig> hours failed to significantly rescue cell number . these results imply that the activation of mxd <dig> leads to an irreversible decrease in cell number, likely due to the induction of a program of gene expression upon long-term expression of mxd <dig> .

the mxd <dig> promoter region has been shown to be regulated by the transcription factor e2f <dig>  <cit> , a critical transcriptional activator for the transition from the g <dig> to the s phase of the cell cycle . in agreement, several groups have shown that mxd <dig> is expressed specifically in the s phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . the timing of mxd <dig> expression suggests that it may play a role in cell cycle progression through the s phase. in support of this possibility, it has been observed that a transient increase in proliferation occurs in both normal mouse gnps  <cit>  and now in this study of human medulloblastoma cells . the fact that this observation was made in both models suggests that the phenotype observed in response to mxd <dig> overexpression is a conserved aspect of mxd <dig> function.

additionally, the overall decrease in cellular proliferation in response to persistent mxd <dig> overexpression is also true in both normal  <cit>  and diseased  <cit>   models. this decrease in proliferation can be explained by the activation of apoptosis as a fail-safe mechanism upon persistent overexpression beyond the s phase of the cell cycle. such a mechanism exists for oncogenes such as the transcriptional network relative myc  <cit> . in support of this possibility, both transient overexpression of mxd <dig> in gnps  <cit>  and stable mxd <dig> overexpression in human medulloblastoma cell lines  <cit>  show an increase in apoptosis. when we examined apoptosis activity at  <dig> hours in our inducible cell lines, we were unable to find any significant difference in caspase 3/ <dig> activity in response to mxd <dig> activation ; however, there is a trend towards increased caspase 3/ <dig> activity at  <dig> hours for er-mxd <dig>  consistent with the decreased cell number observed. interestingly, the maximal response to hydrogen peroxide treatment  in the er-mxd <dig> line was  <dig> -fold less when compared to the control er-mxd <dig> e66d cell line , suggesting that the capacity of the er-mxd <dig> cell line to undergo apoptosis is reduced even in the absence of mxd <dig> induction. the inherent leakiness in our inducible system could account for this difference between the cell lines. if this is true then it would suggest that at low nuclear concentrations mxd <dig> functions as an anti-apoptotic factor leading to the subsequent difference in the response to hydrogen peroxide under baseline conditions. further experimentation will be necessary to test this intriguing possibility.

distinct patterns of gene expression are observed upon acute versus long-term mxd <dig> activation
the results presented thus far indicate that mxd <dig> has a dual role in daoy cell proliferation, as we suggested before  <cit> , and that its role is dependent on how long mxd <dig> is active or present in the nucleus. we report here an initial burst in proliferation  followed by decreased cell counts  upon mxd <dig> translocation to the nucleus. some remaining questions, then, are whether the observed phenotypes due to mxd <dig> activation are the result of two distinct mechanisms and/or whether the observed phenotypes are the direct result of mxd <dig> function. these questions remain for both normal and diseased models. to begin to address these questions in the context of human medulloblastoma, we examined the pathways changed in response to mxd <dig> activation in our inducible cell lines.

to this end, we conducted microarray experiments to compare gene expression between the “early”  and “late”  effects of mxd <dig> overexpression. samples were taken from  <dig> and  <dig> hours post treatment from both er-mxd <dig> and er-mxd <dig> e66d cell lines, in order to define acute and long-term changes in the pattern of gene expression elicited by mxd <dig>  differentially expressed genes were defined as those genes that showed greater than 2-fold changes in er-mxd <dig>  over er-mxd <dig> e66d . it should be noted that this approach aimed at identifying changes that require mxd <dig> binding to the dna through its basic domain, as this interaction has been reported to be disrupted in the e66d mutation  <cit> . a complete list of differentially expressed genes is presented in additional file 7: table s <dig> 

gene ontology analysis of these results is presented in figure  <dig>  using metacore analysis software, a comparison experiment was performed between differentially expressed genes at  <dig> hours  versus  <dig> hours . gene intersection  showed  <dig>  unique early genes  and  <dig>  unique late genes ;  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed in both time points . pathway comparison analysis is shown in figures 4b-d. the  <dig> most differentially affected pathways were grouped according to whether they are mostly represented in the 12-hour data set  or the 72-hour data set , or similarly represented in both . overall, the  <dig> hour data set is characterized by pathways related to immune response, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. this result is consistent with the proliferative phenotypes we report in this paper; the actual outcome at a specific time is likely the result of the balance between apoptotic and proliferative signals. the immune response pathway might indicate that medulloblastoma cells are undergoing a stress response upon mxd <dig> activation. the most differentially affected pathways at  <dig> hours  include cell adhesion related genes. it can be hypothesized, then, that long term expression of mxd <dig> results in transcriptional modulation of genes that might explain the observed decrease in cell number due to loss of cell adhesion. the most significantly affected pathways at both time points  include vegf signaling, the tgf/wnt pathways, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal remodeling. interestingly, the hedgehog  pathway is also affected. while these pathways are all relevant to several aspects of cancer biology , it is especially important to note the effect of mxd <dig> overexpression on the hh pathway, consistent with previous results from our laboratory  <cit> . affected genes in or related to the hh pathway are presented in figure  <dig>  interestingly, shh was found to be upregulated , while smo was upregulated after  <dig> hours of mxd <dig> overexpression in the nucleus. upregulation of smo could therefore represent an early response leading to hh mediated proliferation, while subsequent overexpression of shh could represent an autocrine and/or paracrine proliferative signal. differentially regulated genes in the cell cycle, vegf and wnt pathways are presented in additional file 8: figures s <dig>  additional file 9: figure s <dig> and additional file 10: figure s <dig>  for the complete pathway enrichment analysis, see additional file 11: figure s <dig> and additional file 12: table s <dig>  select target genes from each pathway identified were validated by qrt-pcr .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we use 4-oht inducible human medulloblastoma cell lines to show that mxd <dig> activation results in a transient increase in cell proliferation. in corroboration with previous studies, persistent activation of mxd <dig> eventually results in an overall decrease in cell number. with microarray expression profiling we report candidate downstream targets of mxd <dig> differentially regulated upon acute versus persistent expression of mxd <dig>  lastly, with gene ontology analysis we identify several major pathways enriched in response to acute  versus persistent  mxd <dig> activation that provide insight into the opposing roles of mxd <dig> in medulloblastoma proliferation in a time dependent manner.
