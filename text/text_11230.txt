BACKGROUND
hospital acquired infection  also known as nosocomial infections are gaining momentum and centre for disease control usa, estimates about  <dig>  deaths a year due to infections acquired from hospital  <cit> . hai are caused by organisms that include bacteria and fungi entering via surgical sites, urinary and other catheters. nosocomial associated invasive fungal diseases are of public health concern and candidemia is becoming very prevalent in european countries  <cit> . the fourth most common cause of bloodstream infection is candida, accounting for more than 85 % of all fungemias in usa and europe  <cit> . however the rising number of immunocompromised people, unwarranted use of multiple broad spectrum antibiotics and the advent of implanted medical devices  <cit>  has paved the way for rare non albicans candida species  <cit>  as agents of invasive mycoses and nosocomial bloodstream infections  <cit> . recently invasive non albicans candidiasis cases have been reported from many parts of the world . among the non albicans candida species, c. tropicalis and c. glabrata have emerged as important opportunistic pathogens  <cit> .

most recently, species belonging to the candida haemulonii complex  <cit>  has been described as important agent of fungemia with a significant global distribution  <cit>  and lehman et al.  <cit>  categorised these species belonging to c. haemulonii into two genetically distinct groups. furthermore infections caused by two phenotypically related species – c. pseudohaemulonii  <cit>  and c. auris are on the rise  <cit> . first described in  <dig> by satoh et al.  <cit>  in a japanese patient, it is striking to see the aggressive pace at which c. auris has expanded its clinical spectrum worldwide from minor cases of superficial infections such as ear canal infections to highly invasive cases of bloodstream infections  <cit> . previous studies  <cit>  as well as our study demonstrate that all these clinical isolates have a precociously high tolerance to amphotericinb   <cit>  and fluconozole   <cit> , the first line treatment antifungals. even more concerning is the rapid emergence of resistance to echinocandins  <cit> , the newest class of antifungals which may leave no treatment option available leading to clinical failure.

many pathogenic species within the candida clade such as candida albicans and candida glabrata have been extensively studied at the genome level, while emerging fungal pathogens candida auris and candida haemulonii remains unexplored. the basic characteristics of the genome of c. auris was recently made available  <cit> . however detailed information regarding the genome architecture, virulence and mechanisms of multidrug resistance of these emerging novel complexes of pathogenic yeasts are lacking. furthermore, the commercial automated systems routinely fail to identify c. auris correctly; thereby its actual occurrence is underreported. even more alarming is the fact that misdiagnosis may lead to incorrect treatment or delay of proper treatment, thereby increasing the chances of fatalities. as expected, c. auris fungemia is associated with a high mortality rate  and therapeutic failure  <cit> . it also does not exhibit the known attributes responsible for virulence in candida species such as hyphae formation and the cells are much smaller in size than that of c. albicans . towards understanding the basic biology of the multidrug resistant pathogen, we have carried out whole genome sequencing of a multidrug resistant clinical isolate of c. auris using illumina sequencing technology and report that c. auris has a highly divergent genome. analysis using c. albicans as a reference genome revealed a set of orthologs such as drug transporters, oligopeptide transporters, secreted proteinases and mannosyl transferases which may play a role in virulence and drug resistance. however most of the genome is uncharacterized and we speculate that some of these hypothetical proteins may be involved in species specific characteristics which promote its aggressiveness as a pathogen.

RESULTS
clinical isolates of candida show multi drug resistance
with the background of the growing incidences of candidiasis we have determined the hierarchy of the causative candida species from clinical cases of invasive non-albicans candidiasis. in collaboration with manipal hospital, bengaluru we have screened clinical samples from invasive cases of candidiasis . identification of the isolates was done by vitek <dig>  performed at manipal hospital. we saw a significant increase in the frequency of candidiasis from  <dig> to  <dig> and we also found that non albicans candida species are occupying the centre stage in such infections. case reports from bloodstream infections revealed that in  <dig>   <dig>  % of infections were caused by c. albicans and c. tropicalis. however in  <dig>   <dig>  % of the cases were reported to be caused by c. haemulonii. both c. albicans and c. tropicalis were susceptible to the commonly used antifungals amb and fcz . however, all the clinical isolates identified as c. haemulonii showed increased tolerance to both fcz and amb. these isolates are referred as candida isolates  henceforth. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the isolates had mic <dig> value of >32 μg/ml and >7 μg/ml for fcz and amb  respectively. since the patients were never administered amb previously, it is difficult to comment that amb resistance in these set of clinical isolates was inherent or acquired. however all these isolates were susceptible to caspofungin, the newer class of antifungal drugs- echinocandins . the isolate ci  <dig> which showed resistance to both amb and fcz with highest mic <dig> values was used for further analysis. the antifungal susceptibility profile of ci  <dig> is presented in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> 
in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of candida: all the isolates were identified as c. haemulonii by vitek <dig>  susceptibility testing was done by broth microdilution method at 37 °c for 48 h as mentioned in materials and methods. a comparison of mic <dig> values of all isolates for fcz indicates all clinical isolates have mic range of 32–64 μg/ml. b comparison of mic <dig> values of all isolates for amb shows that all clinical isolates are resistant to amb. candida isolate ci  <dig> has the highest mic <dig> value of > = 16 μg/ml

complete genome sequence of the clinical isolate ci 6684
we sequenced the genome of ci  <dig> using illumina sequencing technology. a high-quality reference genome using illumina reads was assembled de novo as described in methods . the assembled draft genome of ci  <dig> comprises  <dig> scaffolds with an estimated genome size of  <dig> ,766 bp,  <dig>  % gc and  <dig>  % ns. the average base is found in the scaffold with a scaffold n <dig> of  <dig> kb. a total of  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> rrnas and  <dig> trnas were predicting using different tools .

the basic annotation of  <dig> predicted protein coding genes were done using blastp against current refseq fungal protein database and protein nr database.  <dig> proteins found orthologs with a mean query coverage of  <dig>  % , mean identity of  <dig>  %  and e-value > e− <dig>   <dig>  % of ci  <dig> proteins were orthologous to c. lusitaniae atcc  <dig>  however majority of the proteins were assigned as hypothetical, since the closely related candida species c. lusitaniae protein database have also annotated those similar proteins to be hypothetical/ functionally uncharacterized. ci  <dig> was found to be diploid with a similar facs profile to that of c. albicans sc- <dig> by flow cytometric analysis as shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the general features of the genome of ci  <dig> along with known pathogenic candida species. the average size  of coding sequence domain  of ci  <dig> seems to be least, whilst the intergenic distance  is similar to that of other species.table  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis reveals ci  <dig> is closely related to candida auris
phylogenetic tree based on the partial sequence of 18 s rrna, its <dig>   <dig>  s rrna complete sequence, its <dig> and 28 s rrna partial sequence revealed that ci  <dig> belongs to candida auris clade of korean and indian isolates with 99 % bootstrapped confidence . to further confirm its origin, we performed multiple sequence alignment with the indian c. auris isolates and found complete conservation of rrna and its sequences . the same isolate was also able to grow at 40 °c and 42 °c as reported for c. auris but not for c. haemulonii  <cit> . electrophoretic karyotyping by pfge of ci <dig> yielded  <dig> bands and the pattern was similar to that reported previously for c. auris  <cit>  . because diagnostic laboratories rely only on automated systems like vitek  <dig> or apic20c which routinely identifies c. auris as c. haemulonii or c. famata, the actual occurrence of c. auris fungemia is under reported  <cit> . our results emphasize the need to develop accurate species identification system based on molecular typing methods to ensure proper management of fungemia. another recently developed method for identifying c. auris by maldi-tof has also been reported  <cit> . henceforth ci  <dig> will be referred to c. auris  <dig> in the remaining study.fig.  <dig> its phylogeny and electrophoretic karyotyping reveals that ci  <dig> belongs to c. auris clade. a phylogenetic tree based on the partial sequence of 18 s rrna, its <dig>   <dig>  s rrna complete sequence, its <dig> and 28 s rrna partial sequences of species belonging to the c. haemulonii complex and related candida species. our isolate ci  <dig> is related to c. auris as it falls in the same clade. b electrophoretic karyotyping shows  <dig> bands similar to those reported for c. auris by oh j b et al., where they reported genotypic relatedness between c. haemulonii and closely related species. c. albicans  shows four distinct bands. corresponding c. auris lane  shows five bands 



in order to determine the evolutionary position of c. auris  <dig> in the fungal genus tree, a concatenated phylogenetic tree was constructed based on orthologs of  <dig> conserved proteins  from  <dig> pathogenic species under the phylum ascomycota . our analysis shows bifurcation of c. albicans and c. auris  <dig> in two distinct clades. however, we can see that c. auris  <dig> and c. lusitaniae falls in the same clade, indicating convergence at the protein level. this is further confirmed by the amino acid substitution matrix of the house keeping machinery by maximum likelihood estimation wherein the number of amino acid substitutions per site between sequences is low . tajima’s neutrality test indicates a positive d value which reflects low levels of polymorphism in the core housekeeping machinery of all these species including c. auris  <dig> . tajima’s relative rate test was performed to determine the heterogeneity of evolutionary rates between c. lusitaniae and c. auris  <dig> with c. albicans used as an out group . the χ <dig> test statistic was  <dig>  . p-value was less than  <dig> ; hence null hypothesis was rejected, thereby indicating different rates of evolution for these species.fig.  <dig> evolutionary position of candida auris isolate  <dig> in the pathogenic fungal tree. a phylogenetic tree based on orthologs of  <dig> conserved proteins from  <dig> pathogenic species under the phylum ascomycota.

candida auris has a highly divergent genome
to gain deeper insights into the genome conservation and evolution of c. auris with other pathogenic candida species, we performed whole genome alignment of sequencing reads against c. albicans sc- <dig>  c. glabrata cbs- <dig>  c. lusitaniae atcc  <dig> and saccharomyces cerevisiae s288c. more than  <dig>  % of the c. auris  <dig> reads did not align to the current whole  genome sequences of these four species mentioned above. this indicates that c. auris  <dig> is highly divergent at the genome level. to further investigate we compared synonymous codon usage between c. auris  <dig>  c. albicans sc- <dig>  c. albicans wo- <dig>  c. lusitaniae atcc  <dig> and c. glabrata cbs- <dig> . the codon usage in c. auris  <dig> shows very less overlaps to codon usage in c. albicans  as shown in fig. 4a and b. the synonymous codon usage appears to be significantly overlapping for c. auris  <dig> and c. lusitaniae which correlates and supports the relatedness found in the results of phylogenetic analyses . in addition, the codon usage in c. auris  <dig> also shows fair overlap with c. glabrata where there was no similarity found at the genomic scale between the two . the difference in codon usage can be to enhance optimal protein structure and function from the already prevailing behaviours in c. albicans. this observation suggests the codon usage bias; which is required for understanding the selective pressures involved in evolution of these fungal species. in the same light, the dot plots of whole  genome comparison of c. auris  <dig> with respect to c. albicans  and c. glabrata cbs- <dig> showed no linearity at the genome scale  which supports the observations seen in synonymous codon usage plots. c. auris  <dig> genome seemed to have linear genomic synteny with c. lusitaniae genome which was very evident with the blastp results  as well as synonymous codon usage.fig.  <dig>

c. auris  <dig> has highest number of orthologs in c. lusitaniae atcc  <dig>  however most of them were annotated as hypothetical



in this study, genomic relatedness was carried out using ggd calculator , formula  <dig>  performed at http://ggdc.dsmz.de . the ggd was calculated between c. auris  <dig> and c. albicans , c. lusitaniae atcc  <dig>  c. glabrata cbs- <dig> and s. cerevisiae s288c . the genomic distances based on hsp/mum  found out using blat  <cit>  were on an average  <dig> , indicating the number of identical bases between the genomes is inversely proportional to the hsp length. the probability that these species belong to the same species or same subspecies is  <dig> as indicated by logistic regression of dna-dna hybridization .table  <dig> genomic relatedness calculated using genome-to-genome distance calculator






distances are calculated by  comparing two genomes using the blat program to obtain hsps/mums and  inferring distances from the set of hsps/mums using three distinct formulas. the distances are transformed to values analogous to ddh. the ddh estimate results from a generalized linear model  which also provides the estimate’s confidence interval . an additional bootstrap confidence interval is listed if this option was chosen in the job submission form. logistic regression  is used for reporting both the probabilities that ddh is > =70 % and > =79 %. ggdc is mainly used to calculate the in silico relatedness of the species



functional annotation of the c. auris  <dig> genome
functional annotation was done in blast2go that combined the blastp annotation results  with the predicted interproscan results. the assigned go descriptions to each protein were considered at an e-value greater than e− <dig>  out of  <dig> predicted proteins  <dig> go terms were annotated to  <dig> sequences. the go terms were placed in three domains, biological process , molecular function  and cellular components . figure 6a-c represents the level  <dig> go terms for all the three domains. as evident from fig. 6a, a major proportion of the genome is devoted to cellular and metabolic processes. a significant number of proteins were annotated to have transporter activity apart from binding and catalytic activity.fig.  <dig> functional annotation of c. auris genome. a, b, c represents level  <dig> go terms for the three main domains. the most abundant terms in biological process  is cellular process, metabolic process and single-organism process and in molecular functions , binding, catalytic activity and transporter activity. the common cellular component  termed are the cell, organelle and membrane. d distribution of various enzymes into the six enzyme classes according to e.c numbers. e, f represents gene families predicted in c. auris that are orthologous to c. albicans




we also performed enzyme classification analysis based on enzyme commission  numbers predictions for each sequence. we found that hydrolases are the largest group of c. auris  <dig> enzymes , followed by transferases  and oxidoreductases . blast2go identified  <dig> enzyme  out of which  <dig> enzymes got mapped to kegg pathways. blastkoala was used to reconstruct kegg pathways for c. auris  <dig>   <dig> proteins  got annotated into various pathways. this analysis revealed that the central pathways pertaining to carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolisms are conserved.

core circuitry related to virulence is conserved in c. auris 6684
considering the high genomic variability of c. auris  <dig>  we asked the question that whether gene families that are known to have a role in pathogenicity of candida species  <cit>  are also conserved in c. auris 6684? we used the genome of c. albicans sc <dig> as the template gene model to predict orthologs in our isolate as it is well annotated at the experimental level. this approach yielded  <dig> orthologous proteins with functional annotations. our analysis predicted an arsenal of transporters orthologous to that of c. albicans, belonging primarily to the major facilitator superfamily and abc  superfamily  <cit>  . the up regulation of these multidrug efflux pumps may explain the intrinsically low susceptibility of c. auris  <dig> to antifungal drugs. apart from the general transcription factors,  <dig> proteins were predicted to have dna binding/sequence specific dna binding/transcription factor activity. we also predicted a multitude of zinc finger transcription factors orthologous to those present in saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans and scheffersomyces stipites. notably the zn   <dig> cys  <dig> transcription factor family is enriched in our isolate . four of these are known to be key regulators of mdr <dig> transcription in c. albicans; gain-of-function mutations of which leads to up regulation of multidrug efflux pump mdr <dig>  thereby leading to multidrug resistance  <cit> .

the genome was found to contain transcription factors like ste-related and mads-box proteins which have been previously shown to be involved in the virulence of human fungal pathogens  <cit>  and plant fungal pathogens  <cit>  respectively. ste12p is conserved in many fungi, regulating processes involved in mating, filamentation, substrate invasion, cell wall integrity and virulence  <cit> , while mads-box proteins bind to dna and have dimerization activity  <cit> . our analysis also indicated conservation of the rim <dig> transcriptional pathway that is known to respond to alkaline ph in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  <dig> proteins were predicted to have kinase/phosphorylation activity. out of this,  <dig> proteins have the serine/threonine kinase domain and the rest were predicted to be involved in protein phosphorylation due to the presence of putative kinase domain/atp binding domain. c. auris  <dig> draft genome encodes for kinases like hog <dig>  protein kinase a  and two-component histidine kinase. activation of stress signaling pathways regulated by these protein kinases have been implicated to enhance tolerance of pathogenic fungi to chemical fungicides and antifungal peptides  <cit> . hog <dig> protein is a fungal mitogen-activator protein  kinase which has been implicated in responses to oxidative and hyperosmotic stresses in a few human pathogens including c. albicans  <cit> . pka is shown to be activated in response to extracellular nutrients and subsequently regulates metabolism and growth, while two-component histidine kinase is shown to be critical to morphogenesis and virulence  <cit> .

we also identified eight opt genes encoding putative oligopeptide transporters which have been implicated in the acquisition of nutrient versatility thereby helping the pathogen to adapt to various host niches  <cit> . interestingly it has been reported that in c. albicans, these genes are also induced upon phagocytosis by macrophages  <cit> . we also found orthologs of genes predicted to be hexose transporters, maltose transporters and permeases  which further expands its nutrient assimilation machinery, thereby helping it to acclimatize to diverse host niches.

our next step was to hunt down the attributes that may explain the aggressive behavior of the pathogen. our analysis indeed predicted many known virulence associated genes . since the cell wall serves as the interface between the pathogen and the host immune defense, components of the cell wall serve as pathogen associated molecular patterns and virulence factors. our analysis indicated that the family of mannosyl transferases is conserved in c. auris  <dig> with many predicted orthologs. apart from maintaining cell wall architecture by coordinating glycan synthesis, these enzymes play a very important role in immune recognition, host cell adherence and virulence in c. albicans  <cit> . integrins and adhesins are the other two gene families which have a crucial role in adherence and virulence of c. albicans  <cit> . however our annotation predicted only two proteins, one structurally similar to alpha-subunit of human leukocyte integrin; predicted to play a role in morphogenesis, adhesion, mouse coecal colonization and virulence; and another secreted protein similar to alpha agglutinin anchor subunit which has been previously shown to be induced upon exposure to fluconazole. this clearly suggests that c. auris employs distinct mechanisms for host cell adhesion.

we also found four orthologs of secreted aspartyl proteases  two of which were predicted to have greater expression upon deep epidermal invasion; greater expression in vaginal than oral infection  <cit>  and prominent role in biofilm formation. we also found two genes annotated as vacuolar aspartic proteinases. the secreted aspartic proteinases help the fungus to digest host proteins and the resulting peptides are taken up into the cell by specific transporters like the oligopeptide transporters family mentioned above  <cit> . our results also annotated eight genes orthologous to secreted lipases. in all, our analysis revealed that enzyme families implicated in invasiveness like mannosyl transferases, secreted aspartyl proteases and lipases are enriched in our clinical isolate. however the adhesion and integrin gene families are ill represented. this information has been categorized in additional file 2: table s <dig>  our analysis also revealed  <dig> proteins predicted to be induced or repressed upon rat catheter or biofilm formation. this includes a multitude of enzymes, transcription factors, ribosomal proteins and transporters. this clearly indicates that c. auris  <dig> has significant ability to form biofilms since the core genes involved in biofilm formation are conserved. however experiments need to be done to validate the same.

structure of mating loci in c. auris and pcr based diagnostic test to differentiate between c. auris and c. haemulonii
another peculiarity seen in candida species is the highly diverse nature of sexuality. diploids like c. tropicalis and c. parapsilosis are unable to mate while c. albicans shows a parasexual cycle. haploids like c. lusitaniae and c. gulliermondii are heterothaliic in nature  <cit> . it is interesting to note that virulence and mode of reproduction are being analysed as linked phenomenon in recent years. c. lusitaniae is a heterothallic species known to be involved in sexual reproduction. on the other hand certain candida species are either parasexual or asexual. considering the high similarity shared by c. auris  <dig> and c. lusitaniae, we speculated that c. auris  <dig> might have a sexual stage similar to the latter. sexual mating is controlled by a single genetic locus called the mat locus consisting of two alleles-mata and matα.

to understand the mode of reproduction in c auris, we analysed the mat loci  in the genome assembly. our search led to the identification of a putative gene sequence in c. auris  <dig> genome with similarities to α mating pheromone of naumovozyma castellii cbs  <dig>  the gene sequence consists of a 654-bp orf that encodes for five putative α pheromone peptide repeats separated by kex <dig> proteinase cleavage sites. two of the five α-peptides are identical in sequence; the remaining three contains additional da residues . we also found a homologue of kex <dig> in the genome. however, the genes in the vicinity of mf-α were all annotated as hypothetical . interestingly, the three non-sex genes  of the mtl locus namely, the essential phosphatidyl inositol kinase gene , the essential poly  polymerase gene , and the nonessential oxysterol binding protein gene  were present in a different scaffold . in c. albicans, these genes have been implicated in biofilm impermeabilty and fluconazole resistance  <cit> . thus mat α gene is located in a different locus. in c. auris  <dig>  erg <dig> is also located on the same scaffold as mtl non sex genes and in c. albicans, the loss of heterozygosity at the mtl locus has been correlated to azole resistance  <cit> . however we could not find mata gene in the genome. thorough experimentation needs to be done to establish its sexuality.fig.  <dig> identification of mating gene mf α and mating loci in c. auris.
a the amino acid sequence of the mf α gene. regions encoding the mature α pheromone peptide is shown in blue color. possible kex <dig> cleavage sites are shown in red colour. additional da residues present in three of the peptides have been underlined. b scaffold  <dig> shows conservation of non sex genes of mtl locus, however, mf α gene is present in a different scaffold



the sequence of the gene coding mating factor α is unique to each candida species and therefore we designed pcr primers specifically for mf α gene. this pcr was tested on c. haemulonii  <dig> obtained from mtcc, imtech and c. auris  <dig>  as evident in fig. 8a, c. auris  <dig> gave an amplicon at 400 bp which was not seen for c. haemulonii. this test was further extrapolated to other clinical isolates reported to be c. haemulonii and many of them turned to be pcr positive for c. auris . the same isolates also showed a similar pfge pattern , thereby confirming the fact that these were misdiagnosed as c. haemulonii.fig.  <dig> pcr based diagnostic method to differentiate between c. auris and c. haemulonii. a primers based on c. auris  <dig> mfα gene gives a specific amplicon at 400 bp. b amplification was not seen in the case of c. haemulonii  <dig>  however, four clinical isolates identified to be c. haemulonii by manipal hospital, showed a band at 400 bp. c the pfge profile of these four clinical isolates was similar to that of c. auris 6684



CONCLUSIONS
opportunistic infections caused by candida are on the rise globally and newer pathogenic species are emanating at an unprecedented rate. what are not evolving at the same pace are the current methods of diagnosis and treatment options leading to misdiagnosis and clinical failure. the last decade has witnessed the emergence of newer species called c. haemulonii from being the causative agent of minor infections to one of the leading causes of invasive infections. it is currently increasing in prevalence, with several ongoing outbreaks in developing and underdeveloped countries. the actual incidence rate is however misleading because of the inability of the current automated systems used for screening of fungal species to identify novel emerging fungal pathogens such as c. auris, c. pseudohaemulonii and other related species due to striking similarities in biochemical characters and the unavailability of molecular markers for accurate identification. we have generated the first draft genome sequence of a commonly misdiagnosed, emerging pathogen c. auris. the isolate was identified as c. haemulonii by vitek <dig>  however pfge analysis revealed  <dig> bands similar to that of c. auris and accurate species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis based on the partial sequence of 18s rrna, its <dig>   <dig> s rrna complete sequence, its <dig> and 28s rrna partial sequence. genome sequencing will highlight important differences which may act as accurate identification markers for this group of emerging pathogens at the species level. towards this we have developed a pcr based diagnostic test to distinguish between these two pathogens.

the genome of c. auris spans about ~ <dig>  mb with  <dig> predicted protein coding genes. strikingly, at the genomic level, c. auris shows a highly divergent relationship with other pathogenic candida species as indicated by a meagre  <dig>  % alignment of the sequencing reads to other candida genomes and supported by lack of linear synteny of genomic dot plots. c. auris is phylogenetically closest to c. haemulonii whose genome sequence is unavailable. among the sequenced yeast species, it is closest to c. lusitaniae; however, its genome is also not well annotated functionally. therefore majority of the protein coding genes were predicted to be hypothetical/functionally uncharacterized. the role of each of these unique candidate proteins demands for urgent functional studies. hence accurate identification and de novo assembly and annotation still remains a challenge for divergent sequences among emerging pathogenic species.  <dig>  % of the protein coding genes showed no sequence similarity to genes available in public database, thus indicating that speciation genes are embedded within the genome which may be involved in grooming it as an aggressive pathogen. with the limited data available, it is difficult to comment about the genomic architecture of speciation and how it facilitates or impedes further divergence. to further probe into the difference at the functional level we resorted to synonymous codon usage plots which distinguish ways by which translational selection of protein coding genes occurs among related species. the above observation is supported by ggdc that calculated the in silico relatedness of c. auris and sequenced candida pathogens, surprisingly the logistic regression quantifies no relatedness among the species. the ecological niche of most of these candida species is known, that may throw light on the evolutionary forces grooming these organisms at the species level. however till date there are no reports of naturally occurring c. auris species. c. auris can grow at elevated temperatures of 42 °c whereas c. haemulonii cannot. this gives us a hint that c. auris has the potential to infect the avian fauna whose body temperature is in the range of 40 °c to 42 °c. however, additional experiments need to be done in order to validate this phenomenon.

the foremost criterion to be a successful candida pathogen is the ability to colonize diverse anatomical niches within the host such as skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, vagina and the vasculature. each candida pathogen has its own machinery dedicated to host cell adhesion, recognition, invasion and colonization. we compared c. auris genome with that of c. albicans since it is well annotated and well-studied as well as distantly related to c. auris. while the spectrum of virulence traits like hyphae formation, white opaque switching is quite different between these two species, we found that c. auris still shares some common virulence traits with c. albicans. our analysis highlights that a significant portion of c. auris genome encodes for transporters belonging to the abc transporter family and major facilitator superfamily. this may partly explain its increased tolerance to antifungal drugs. the multidrug resistant nature of the pathogen and the limited arsenal of antifungal agents indicate that there is a critical need for finding new drug targets and genome sequence of c. auris therefore may prove useful in finding alternative targets that can augment the existing antifungal therapy. our analysis also provides a snapshot of the potential genetic attributes that may explain its virulent nature. the genome of the pathogen harbours gene families such as lipases, oligopeptide transporters, mannosyl transferases and transcription factors which play a multitude of roles in colonization, invasion and iron acquisition. also majority of genes known to be involved in formation of biofilm appears to be conserved. in all, we see that c. auris shares many genes with c. albicans and c. lusitaniae indicating a common ancestry; however it may have acquired novel genetic traits that have groomed it as a specialist pathogen. it is possible that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics shaped its genome to expand not only its clinical spectrum of infection but also to emerge as a successful multidrug resistant pathogen.

in all, our study provides the first whole genomic overview of c. auris, the first member of the candida haemulonii and related pathogenic fungi complex to be sequenced. this report is a major step toward the initiation of genomic studies of this complex group of fungi which are fast turning drug resistant and may be a menace with limited treatment options available in the future.
