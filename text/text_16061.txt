BACKGROUND
mitochondria are essential organelles that generate atp through the respiratory chain to provide energy for many biochemical reactions and cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. mitochondria are one of the organelles that contain its own genetic material, the mitochondrial genome . it is thought that mitochondria evolved over millions of years after originating from bacteria that had invaded eukaryotic cells. it is thus not surprising that pol-γ has a lineage similar to prokaryotic dna polymerase a in e. coli  <cit> . a nuclear-dna encoded gene of the catalytic subunit of pol γ  has been shown to be essential for mtdna stability  <cit> .

the mitochondrial genomes in many mammalian systems are small when compared to their corresponding nuclear genomes. human mtdna, for example, is only ~ <dig>  kb in length and rodent mtdna is ~ <dig>  kb  <cit> . mutations in either human mtdna or polg <dig> have been implicated in a number of diseases such as leigh's syndrome, alpers syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, the size of mtdna is relatively large, ~ <dig>  kb in size. cells depleted of mtdna  have been isolated through the treatment with ethidium bromide which results in the formation of tiny or petite colonies in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the petite mutants fail to grow on media containing non-fermentable carbon sources owing to a lack of mitochondrial functions. petites are not readily isolated from wild type schizosaccharomyces pombe using ethidium bromide treatment  <cit> . however, some unidentified nuclear mutations have facilitated the isolation of cells depleted of mtdna  <cit> . the isolated petites exhibited severely retarded growth phenotypes that impeded further genetic analyses of these petite strains.

in this study, we show that the nuclear gene pog1+  is essential for mtdna maintenance. significantly, cells bearing a pog1Δ allele are capable of forming petite colonies after extended incubation times under optimal growth conditions. the pog1Δ cells display multiple defects such as non-uptake of mitotracker dyes, impaired mitochondrial structures, and depletion of mtdna. genome-wide expression profiling of mtdna-less cells reveals that many genes encoding proteins involved in response to stimulus, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy reserve metabolism are induced. on the other hand, many genes encoding proteins involved in amino acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation are repressed. the result indicates an adaptive expression response in petite-negative mtdna-less s. pombe strains.

RESULTS
dna polymerase γ is important to support normal growth in s. pombe
we extracted protein sequences of the dna polymerase γ  using the s. pombe genome in the public database  <cit> . blast analysis of the s. pombe pol-γ revealed its homolog in various other species such as homo sapiens, rattus norvegicus, mus musculus, caenorhabditis elegans, candida albicans, and s. cerevisiae. phylogenic analysis based on protein sequences showed that s. pombe pol-γ, like these in s. cerevisiae or c. albicans, is very similar to those in mammalian systems .

to investigate the function of the pol-γ, we performed gene deletion analysis using a pcr-mediated approach  <cit> . diploid transformants that formed colonies on plates without uracil supplement were isolated for further validation of gene disruption. the genotype of diploid pog1+/pog1Δ strains was validated by pcr-assays using sequence-specific primers . to further examine whether pog1+ is essential for viability, we performed tetrad dissection analysis. of ~ <dig> asci/tetrads dissected on yes plates, all tetrads displayed a 2: <dig> segregation of normal growing spores versus non-growing spores after growth at 30°c for ~ <dig> days, except for  <dig> tetrad in which one of the wild type spores was implanted deep into the agar and thus impeded its normal growth . this result indicates that pog1+ is essential for vegetative growth. consistent with this, spores that formed normal-sized colonies were unable to grow on uracil-dropout plates . pcr assays confirmed that those spores possessed a wild type allele of pog1+, but not a deletion allele . however, after extended incubation terms, we found the pog1Δ spores were able to form petite colonies . this result indicates that pol-γ is not essential for viability, but is important for normal growth rate in s. pombe.

cells bearing a pog1Δ allele exhibit multiple growth phenotypes
to investigate phenotypes of the pog1Δ strain, the mutant cells were subjected to dapi and aniline staining to visualize dna and cell wall, respectively. wild type cells were cylindrical shaped ~4– <dig> μm in diameter and ~12– <dig> μm in length . the pog1Δ strain were typically dumbbell shaped , had abnormally thick septa , multiple septa  and anucleate cells . the multiple phenotypes of the pog1Δ strain are consistent with the notion that mitochondria are "power plants" that generate energy to support many biochemical reactions and cellular processes.

we next investigated the pol-γ subcellular localization in wild type cells. for this reason, we constructed a strain bearing a sole copy of pog1+-gfp that exhibited no abnormal growth phenotypes, suggesting that c-terminus tagging of pol-γ does not affect its biological function. the gfp-tagged pol-γ showed the subcellular localization resembling to that of mitochondria previously reported  <cit>  .

functional mitochondria are capable of mitotracker uptake, a mitochondrion-selective fluorescent dye  <cit> . to test whether mitochondria were defective in pog1Δ cells, we stained the cells with mitotracker fluorescent dyes. as shown in figure 2c, mitotracker fluorescent dyes aggregated to outline the functional mitochondrial structures in wild type cells. on the other hand, pog1Δ cells failed to show any fluorescent dye uptake, indicating that mitochondria are not functional in pog1Δ cells . cells with mitochondrial defects would fail to grow in media containing only non-fermentable carbon sources such as ethanol or glycerol  <cit> . to examine the growth ability of the pog1Δ strain on non-fermentable carbon sources, serial dilution of wild type and pog1Δ cultures were inoculated on plates containing either fermentable carbon source  or non-fermentable carbon source . both wild type and pog1Δ cells were capable of growing on glucose medium, although pog1Δ cells grew substantially slower than wild type cells . on the other hand, pog1Δ cells failed to grow on plates containing glycerol, consistent with the conclusion that mitochondria are not functional in pog1Δ cells .

to investigate whether the mitochondrial malfunction in pog1Δ cells was associated with disrupted mitochondrial structures, we thus performed electron microscopic  analysis. em images clearly showed the nuclear structure in wild type and pog1Δ strains . however, normal mitochondrial structures were only apparent in wild type cells, but not pog1Δ, suggesting that the mitochondrial architecture had been disrupted . these results indicate that disruption of pol-γ is sufficient to abolish normal mitochondrial structure and consequently mitochondrial function.

mitochondrial dna is depleted in pog1Δ cells
to investigate the role of pol-γ in maintaining the copy number of mtdna, we performed real-time quantitative pcr  using the syber green assay on whole dna extracted from various strains. due to different efficiencies of primer pairs in qpcr assay, the identical concentration of template dna could give rise to different ct-values  from different primer pairs. for adequate estimation of the copy number of the samples, multiple pairs of primers specific to either mtdna or nuclear genome were utilized in the syber green assays. the median of the ct values from ~ <dig> primer pairs specific to mtdna was used to approximate the copy number of mtdna. on the other hand, the median ct value of ~ <dig> primer pairs specific to nuclear dna was used to estimate the copy number of the nuclear dna. the higher the copy number of the sample, the sooner accumulated product would be detected in the real-time qpcr assay as a significant increase in fluorescence, and the lower the ct value.

in wild type cells, the median ct value for the mtdna and nuclear dna was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, using the syber green assay . that is, the median ct value of mtdna was  <dig> -cycles less than that of the nuclear dna. for easy comparison,  <dig> -cycles difference could be converted into ~ <dig>  -fold difference. in other words, the copy number of mtdna was ~ <dig> -fold higher than that of nuclear dna in wild type cells . this result indicates that there are ~ <dig> copies of mtdna in a haploid g1-phase cell . given that the cell-cycle length was mostly occupied by g2-phase  under optimal growth conditions in s. pombe  <cit> , an active growing s. pombe cell would thus contain ~100– <dig> copies.

we next investigated the copy number of mtdna in pog1Δ cells. a majority of pog1Δ cells were found to possess 2c-dna contents, as seen in wild type cells , suggesting no changes in nuclear dna profiles. according to the real-time qpcr assay, the median ct value of mtdna and nuclear dna was found to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in pog1Δ cells . that is to say, the median ct value of mtdna was  <dig> -cycles more than that of the nuclear dna, opposite to those in wild type cells . therefore, the copy number of mtdna was ~1/ <dig> -fold less than that of the nuclear dna in pog1Δ cells . approximately 150– <dig> pog1Δ cells would share one copy of mtdna. this result indicates that mtdna was dramatically depleted in pog1Δ cells.

it has been reported that no mtdna could be detected by southern blot analysis in ptp2- <dig> and ptp1- <dig> cells  <cit> . we thus applied both strains as negative control for the syber green assay. as shown in figure 3c and 3d, the median ct value of mtdna was much higher than that of nuclear dna in either ptp2- <dig> or ptp1- <dig> strains, indicating that the syber green assay is adequate for determination of mtdna and nuclear dna copy numbers. based on the assay, it was estimated that ~25– <dig> ptp2- <dig> or ptp1- <dig> cells would share one copy of mtdna, suggesting that mtdna was depleted in ptp mutant cells.

differentially expressed genes in the pog1Δ strain
whole-genome expression profiling of mutant strains is a useful approach to assess genetic phenotypes of various strains  <cit> . to investigate differential expressions in mtdna-less cells, we performed expression profile analysis in pog1Δ, ptp1- <dig>  and ptp2- <dig> cells using the s. pombe genome-wide dna microarray  <cit> . to this end, total rna extracted from various strains was reverse transcribed in presence of cyanine dye cy5-coupled dutp. cy5-labeled cdna was subjected to microarray hybridized against a cy3-labeled common reference cdna . for reproducibility at least  <dig> independent assays were performed.

expression profiles of mtdna-less strains were compared with the wild type self-self hybridizations for identification of differentially expressed genes using sam analysis  <cit> . as a result, approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes whose expression levels showed to be up-regulated for 3-fold or more in pog1Δ, ptp1- <dig>  and ptp2- <dig>  respectively . approximately  <dig> up-regulated genes  were common in pog1Δ, ptp1- <dig>  and ptp2- <dig> strain, suggesting a universal pattern of expression responses in the mtdna-less cells. the  <dig> up-regulated genes showed to significantly enrich for genes involved in response to various stimuli and stress factors , carbohydrate metabolism , catabolism and biosynthesis , and others   .

approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were found to be down-regulated for at least 3-fold or more in pog1Δ, ptp1- <dig>  and ptp2- <dig>  respectively, compared to those in wild type cells . although only ~ <dig> genes were common to all three strains, the union of  <dig> genes appeared to be significantly enriched in the down-regulated genes of individual mtdna-less strains when the threshold was reduced to 2-fold differences . these  <dig> down-regulated genes  were found to enrich those involved in amino acids and protein metabolism and biosynthesis  and oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory chain reactions   .

comparison of expression profiles of cells depleted of mtdna in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and human namalwa cell lines  <cit>  yielded a common theme that genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolytic pathways and stress response pathways are induced in ρ° cells, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional response mechanism to the depletion of mitochondrial function .

repression of genes involved in energy generation in pog1Δ cells
enzymes involved in tca cycle and cellular respiration are required to function in mitochondria. many of these enzymes are encoded by nuclear dna. only a few subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase  and atpase complexes are encoded by the mtdna in s. pombe, for example, cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  atp <dig>  atp <dig>  and atp <dig>  <cit> . to investigate whether nuclear genes encoding respiratory proteins were expressed in pog1Δ, ptp1- <dig> and ptp2- <dig> cells, we extracted expression profiles of these genes from the genome-wide profiles. for this reason, steady-state levels of  <dig> transcripts encoding enzymes involved in the tca cycle were first extracted and compared with those of ρ° cells in s. cerevisiae based on the study by epstein et al.  <cit>  . the degree of expression level alterations in s pombe mtdna-less pog1Δ, ptp1- <dig>  and ptp2- <dig> strains was more dramatic than those found in ρ° cells of s. cerevisiae . significantly, expression levels of enzymes in part of the tca cycle such as isocitrate dehydrogenase subunits idh1p and idh2p were elevated in all s. pombe mtdna-less strains. the levels of citrate synthase cit1p, aconitate hydratase aco1p and aco2p were elevated only in pog1Δ cells, but reduced in ptp1- <dig> or ptp2- <dig> cells. conversely, levels of succinate-coa ligase subunits lsc1p and lsc2p, succinate dehydrogenase subunits sdh1-4p, and isocitrate dehydrogenase were reduced in all three s. pombe mtdna-less strains . the result indicates that not all genes encoding enzymes involved in tca cycle are down-regulated in the mtdna-less strain.

we subsequently examined expression profiles of genes encoding cytochrome c reductase and oxidase complexes. as shown in figure 5c and 5d, expression levels of transcripts function in both reductase and oxidase were repressed in pog1Δ, ptp1- <dig>  and ptp2- <dig> cells, except for the levels of cqr7+ in ptp2- <dig>  consistent with a lack of mitochondrial function. in addition, expression levels of atp synthase complexes were also repressed . these results suggested that genes encoding proteins involved in energy generation in mitochondria were largely repressed in cells depleted of mtdna.

discussion
the fission yeast s. pombe is known as the petite-negative that can not tolerate the lost of mtdna, in contrast to the budding yeast s. cerevisiae  <cit> . however, some nuclear mutations are known to allow growth of mtdna-less s. pombe cells  <cit> . in this study, we show that an evolutionarily conserved pol-γ is essential for maintenance of mtdna in s. pombe. spores bearing a pog1Δ allele form petite colonies after extended incubation terms . we have further shown that pog1Δ cells exhibit multiple growth phenotypes  and are depleted of mtdna, similar to the ptp mutants . thus, the petite-negative s. pombe mtdna-less cells do not cease to grow on medium containing fermentable carbon courses, although the growth is substantially slow and exhibit severe growth phenotypes.

we show that pog1Δ cells depleted of mtdna possess no normal mitochondrial structures when compared with cells containing mtdna in em analyses . this result suggests that mtdna is required for maintaining normal mitochondrial structures in s. pombe. mitochondrial respiratory complexes including cytochrome c oxidase and atpase are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . in s. pombe, mtdna encodes at least  <dig> subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase  complex and  <dig> subunits of the atpase complex  <cit> . our result suggests that without these cox and atpase subunits cells fail to assemble membranes with mitochondrial potential. consistent with this, pog1Δ cells fail to uptake mitochondria-specific dye or mitotracker due to a lack of mitochondrial membrane potential .

we show that, on average, each haploid cell contains ~100– <dig> copies of mtdna based on the real-time qpcr analysis . this is consistent with the observation of number of mitochondria-specific gfp foci reported by matsuyama et al.  <cit>  and in this study . in pog1Δ cells, the mtdna drops to ~1/300–1/ <dig> copies per cell. similarly, the mtdna in ptp1- <dig> or ptp2- <dig> cells also drops to ~1/50–1/ <dig> copies per cell . the result supports the notion that these strains are depleted of mtdna. residues detected by mtdna-specific primers in the real-time qpcr assay are probably represented the non-specific products; or other nuclear dna polymerases in s. pombe could inefficiently rescue the lack of pol-γ by replicating mtdna in pog1Δ cells. alternatively, pog1Δ spores may carry over the mtdna from the diploid mother cells during sproulation. the mtdna copy number is substantially diluted during the growth of pog1Δ cells. however, it is not clear why the ptp mutant strains display higher mtdna background than the pog1Δ .

genome-wide expression profiling of mtdna-less cells revealed that the nuclear genes encoding carbohydrate metabolism and response to stimulus are induced by at least 3-fold. this result suggests that cells with impaired mitochondrial function attempt to maintain their growth competence potential . in addition, cells lacking mtdna appear to undergo extensive oxidative metabolism, consistent with the notion that respiratory deficiency induces peroxisome biogenesis  <cit> . on the other hand, genes encoding proteins involved in amino acids metabolism and energy production are down-regulated. this result suggested that mtdna-less cells are adapted for slow growth and repress genes that are involved in mitochondrial function. indeed, the majority of the nuclear genes encoding enzymes involved in tca cycle and almost all genes involved in cytochrome c reductase and oxidase complexes are repressed , similar to those seen in ρ° cells in s. cerevisiae.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that pol-γ is essential for mtdna maintenance. cells bearing a pog1Δ allele are viable but grow substantially slower in the petite-negative s. pombe. expression profiling of pog1Δ and other mtdna-less mutant cells indicates that genes involved in glycolytic pathways and stress response are induced, common to budding yeast and human cell line systems  <cit> . taken together, we propose that a common theme of adaptive expression responses to the disruption of mtdna occur in both petite-positive  and petite-negative  cells.
