BACKGROUND
s. agalactiae, also known as gbs, is a gram-positive bacterium that not only causes pneumonia and meningitis in neonates, but also induces bovine mastitis and infects reptiles, amphibians, and various fishes . with the advances in sequencing technology and the reduction of cost, the genomes of s. agalactiae strains of different hosts and subtypes are revealed gradually. to date,  <dig> complete genome sequences,  <dig> draft genome sequences, and  <dig> contig sequences of s. agalactiae have been made publicly available. studies showed that the genome of s. agalactiae can be divided into core genome, dispensable genome, and unique genome; the dispensable genome is important for the analysis of virulence differences and the development of broad-spectrum vaccines  <cit> . comparative genome analysis between bacterial strains that are greatly different in host specificity or virulence may help to rapidly screen for dispensable genes, gene deletions or mutations, and differentially-expressed proteins; it is also an effective way of studying the mechanisms of cross-host infection, pathogenicity, and immunogenicity of s. agalactiae .

pridgeon et al. successfully generated an attenuated s. agalactiae strain 138spar from tilapia-derived s. agalactiae serotype ib strain 138p in laboratory using a sparfloxacin resistance strategy; comparative genome analysis indicated that s. agalactiae 138spar had  <dig> deletions larger than 6 bp and  <dig> snvs  <cit> . although s. agalactiae serotype ib strain can cause infection and diseases in various fishes and amphibians, there is no report of its pathogenicity to humans, and comparative genome and phylogenetic studies indicate that s. agalactiae serotype ia and ib are distantly related  <cit> . currently, s. agalactiae ia is the dominant strain causing infections and deaths in a large number of tilapia in asia, which is also the important pathogen of early-onset neonatal meningitis  <cit> . comparative genome studies have demonstrated that tilapia- and trout-derived s. agalactiae type ia strains and human-derived strains causing neonatal meningitis have a close genomic relationship  <cit> . our laboratory highly passaged the tilapia-derived wild-type strongly-virulent s. agalactiae ia strain hn <dig> and obtained the attenuated strain ym <dig>  to study the molecular mechanisms of s. agalactiae pathogenicity, we performed whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis with hn <dig> and ym <dig> strains and found that ym <dig> genome had significant variations compared to hn016; in ym <dig> genome, there were deletions of multiple genes related to metabolism, transport, and growth. these results are of a great reference value for unraveling the pathogenesis and developing attenuated vaccine of s. agalactiae.

RESULTS
whole genome alignment between s. agalactiae hn <dig> and ym001
the assembling result indicated that the genome size of s. agalactiae ym <dig> was  <dig> ,957 bp, with a gc content of  <dig>  % , while the genome size of s. agalactiae hn <dig> was  <dig> ,722 bp, with a gc content of  <dig>  % . the similartity between both genomes was  <dig>  %. further analysis indicated that the ym <dig> genome contained  <dig> genes and  <dig> rnas, while the genome of hn <dig> had  <dig> genes and  <dig> rnas. the genome of ym <dig> varied significantly compared to hn016; in addition to two large deletions of  <dig> and  <dig>  bp respectively , there were another ten small deletions and  <dig> snvs .table  <dig> ym001-specific genetic variations compared to hn016



analysis of the damages and gene deletions caused by large fragment deletion
as shown in fig.  <dig>  ym <dig> genome had two large deletions compared to hn <dig>  the deletion one was a 5832-bp sequence, which contained a repetitive sequence of 5621 bp separated by a 211-bp fragment in the genome of hn <dig>  there were two repetitive sequences in the genome of hn <dig>  whereas only one repetitive fragment left in the genome of ym <dig>  this repetitive sequence contained 5s rrna, 16s rrna, and 23s rrna genes, as well as other ten different trna genes . the deletion two was a  <dig> -bp sequence, which resulted in a truncation of two genes and deletion of  <dig> genes ; they were four genes of the abc transporter family, marr family transcriptional regulator, ser/thr protein phosphatase , peptide deformylase, glutamate dehydrogenase, membrane protein of unknown function, and acetyltransferase.fig.  <dig> whole genome alignment between s. agalactiae hn <dig> and ym <dig>  the genomes of hn <dig> and ym <dig> were compared with each other using progressive mauve with default parameters. the colinearity of the genomes and the two deletions between hn <dig> and ym <dig> are shown



the deletion or damage of abc transporter gene
abc transporters are integral membrane proteins that conduct transmembrane transport of various solute biomolecules using the energy of atp hydrolysis; the substances absorbed include nutrients and osmoprotectants that range from small sugars, amino acids, and small peptides to metals, anions, iron chelators , and vitamin b <dig>  while the exported substances are surface components of the bacterial cell , proteins involved in bacterial pathogenesis , peptide antibiotics, heme, drugs, and siderophores  <cit> . among the four abc transporter family genes deleted in the ym <dig> genome, three belong to the subfamily b with efflux function, two of which encode proteins that have been demonstrated relating to the efflux of various drugs, to help bacteria obtain multidrug resistance to several antibiotics and tolerance to biocides  <cit> ; the 4th one encodes a protein of subfamily f, which involves in the intercellular communication between bacteria, and the deletion of this gene may cause growth inhibition of the mutant  <cit> . comparative genome analysis of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  pathogenic  <dig> strain and its highly-passaged attenuated strain 168 l showed that the abc transporter proteins might affect the growth and survival of m. hyopneumoniae in different hosts or host tissues  <cit> . the growth of ym <dig> in both solid and liquid cultures was significantly slower than that of hn <dig>  <cit> . fluorescent quantitative detection of tissue bacteria after oral gavage of tilapia with the two strains respectively also indicated that both the survival time and number of hn <dig> in vivo in tilapia were significantly greater than those of ym <dig>  <cit> . a decreased growth performance of ym <dig> due to abc transporter deletion might be one of the main reasons of reduced virulence.

the deletion of marr family transcriptional regulator
oxidative, nitrosative, and aerobic stresses are major factors affecting the survival of pathogens in the host  <cit> . s. agalactiae is a facultative anaerobe, with a wide range of hosts, and may colonize in many tissues including the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, brain, blood, liver, kidney, mammary gland, etc.  <cit> . the wide host range and colonization tissues of s. agalactiae may be associated with the ability of its regulatory systems to sense and adapt to external stimuli, such as oxidative and aerobic stress. studies have shown that oxygen affects the infectivity and virulence of s. agalactiae  <cit> . marr family transcriptional regulator has the function of regulating the oxidative stress response; therefore, deletion of marr coding genes may result in an increased bacterial sensitivity to oxidative and aerobic stress, decreased capability of intracellular survival in macrophages, and reduced virulence  <cit> . the ability of s. sgalactiae to survive in macrophages is an important mechanism for its escape from the host immunity  <cit> . accordingly, we speculate that the deletion of marr family transcriptional regulator coding genes in ym <dig> reduced its growth adaptability and ability to survive in macrophages, decreased its ability to escape from the immune defenses of tilapia, and thereby blocked its continuous growth in and pathogenicity to tilapia.

the deletion of stp
protein phosphorylation is essential for the regulation of cell growth, division, and differentiation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. lately, bacterial homologues of eukaryotic stp have been shown to be necessary for cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, pathogenicity, and secondary metabolism. mutations in these genes exhibited pleiotropic effects on the growth, virulence, and cell segregation of s. sgalactiae, suggesting that these enzymes may regulate the pyrophosphatase activity and other cellular functions in s. sgalactiae  <cit> , and that these genes may have novel roles in regulating bacterial metabolic processes such as purine biosynthesis  <cit> . the deletion of stp in ym <dig> resulted in the loss of multiple purine metabolic pathways . in s. sgalactiae, stp controls the function of ser/thr kinase, post-transcriptional regulation of hemolysin, autolysis, and virulence. although stp is not essential for growth, it is critical for the pathogenicity of s. sgalactiae  <cit> . in view of its important roles in metabolism and pathogenicity of s. agalactiae, stp deletion may be one of the main causes of the reduced virulence of ym <dig> fig.  <dig> metabolic potential. the metabolic pathways of s. agalactiae strains hn <dig> and ym <dig> were mapped and analyzed using kegg pathway database. those pathways, containing mutations affected metabolic-related genes, are shown in thick black line



the deletion of the other four genes
the other four deleted genes were peptide deformylase , glutamate dehydrogenase , acetyltransferase, and a membrane protein of unknown function. pdf is a highly conserved metalloprotease for bacterial growth and participates in bacterial protein biosynthesis and maturation  <cit> ; blocking of its function significantly inhibits the growth of gram-positive pathogens, such as streptococci and staphylococci  <cit> . gdh is an important functional molecule in the process of energy metabolism in bacteria and is related to bacterial pathogenicity; it has been identified as a virulence factor of s. suis serotype two  <cit> . pdf and gdh were deleted from the genome of ym <dig>  which might be the cause of the slow growth and low virulence of ym <dig>  the effect of the deletions of acetyltransferase and the membrane protein of unknown function on s. agalactiae remains to be further studied.

snv and indels analyses between ym <dig> and hn <dig> genomes
snv and indels analyses between ym <dig> and hn <dig> genomes indicated that in addition to the two large deletions, there were a total of  <dig> snvs , and relative to hn <dig>  ym <dig> had another ten deletions . among the  <dig> snvs in the coding region,  <dig> encoded proteins related to metabolism , translation , and transport  . two of the three deletion mutant genes in ym <dig> coded for pts system transporter subunit iic and recombinase recf respectively, while the third one encoded a hypothetical protein of unknown function. however, currently known s. agalactiae virulence factors such as adhesin, exoenzyme, immunoreactive antigen, metal transport, protease, toxin, etc., the majority of which are considered main antigens of s. agalactiae, did not show any variation  <cit> . these results indicated that genetic changes in attenuated strain generated by continuous passaging mainly affected genes related to bacterial growth and metabolism, with little effect on the virulence-related genes, which is thus conducive to the preservation of antigenicity during virulence attenuation by passaging. this may be why attenuated ym <dig> retained its strong immunogenicity. current development of attenuated s. agalactiae vaccine mainly focused on the modification of its virulence factors; however, the results of this study opened a new avenue to the development of attenuated vaccine, i.e., to produce attenuated strain through modifying growth-related genes, under the premise of maximally preserving its immunogenicity and not affecting the virulence factors.

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
crisprs are a bacterial adaptive immune defense mechanism against the invasion of foreign genes. when foreign gene invades bacteria, the crisprs integrate and save the intruding gene fragment. under the re-invasion of the same genes, mediated by specific rna, crisprs and crispr-associated proteins  will cut and destroy the invading foreign genes, which may include bacterial phages, plasmids, and mobile genetic elements   <cit> . s. agalactiae has  <dig> crispr/cas systems, type 1-c crispr <dig> and type 2-a crispr1; while the latter is ubiquitous, the former is only present in a few strains  <cit> . the crispr sequences were analyzed among the 8 s. agalactiae strains in table  <dig> using the crisprs web server . the results indicated that  <dig> tilapia-derived s. agalactiae serotype ib strains did not contain any crispr sequences, while 5 s. agalactiae serotype ia strains all had crispr <dig> but did not contain crispr <dig>  further analysis of the crispr <dig> from the 5 s. agalactiae serotype ia strains showed that the crispr sequence in s. agalactiae strain hn <dig> derived from tilapia in china was same as that in gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig> and had eight spacers, but the attenuated strain ym <dig> only contained seven spacers; all other sequences were the same between both strains . during the process of foreign nucleic acid invasion and bacterial evolution, to avoid overly long locus of crisprs, bacteria may choose to insert or remove spacer sequences between crisprs, and the insertion or removal of spacer is polarized, i.e., a new spacer is always inserted between the leader sequence and the following repetitive sequence, while the removed spacer is usually located at the 3’ end of crisprs  <cit> . lopez-sanchez et al. analyzed the crisprs of more than  <dig> wild-type s. agalactiae strains but did not find the 3’ terminal deletion  <cit> . although liu et al. showed that two spacer sequences were deleted at the 3’ end of crisprs in zq <dig> stain  <cit> , we found that the assembling of the published sequence of this fragment in zq <dig> had certain mistake. after reanalysis and alignment of this sequence, we confirmed that the crisprs of zq <dig> were exactly the same as those of hn <dig> and gd201008- <dig>  compared to other tilapia-derived wild-type virulent strains, the crisprs of ym <dig> had a deletion of  <dig> spacer at the 3’ end. philippe et al. studied the crispr loci of s. thermophilus and found that the selective removal of spacer sequence may be caused by that these spacer sequences have little value for the survival of bacteria in the environment at the time  <cit> . therefore, normal natural growth and passage are hard to cause the removal of crispr spacer sequence in s. agalactiae, whereas in the absence of the threat of foreign nucleic acid invasion, highly intensified continuous passage in laboratory may lead to the loss or removal of spacer sequence in crisprs.table  <dig> characteristics of sequenced s. agalactiae strains used in this study

prophages
prophages are bacterial phages that integrate their genomes into the genome of host bacteria after infection. approximately 65 % of the completely sequenced bacterial genomes carry prophage, and the content of prophage sequences in some bacteria approaches 20 % of the bacterial genomic content  <cit> . studies have reported that whether a bacterial genome carries prophage often determines the difference in virulence between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains  <cit> . the contribution of prophage genes to the pathogenicity of s. enterica serovar typhimurium has been demonstrated by animal experiments  <cit> . prophage analysis of hn <dig>  ym <dig>  and gd201008- <dig> showed that an intact prophage sequence and an incomplete prophage sequence were detected in all the  <dig> strains. all coding dna sequences  and the locations of the prophages in these three strains were exactly the same . our results showed that there was no prophage mutations in the attenuated s. agalactiae strain ym <dig>  which may also help to maintain the antigenic integrity of the attenuated strain.fig.  <dig> the cds of the prophages derived from s. agalactiae hn <dig>  ym <dig>  and gd201008- <dig> respectively. a detailed view of the prophages from the  <dig> strains was produced using the online software phast . different colors represent various phage elements



CONCLUSIONS
in summary, compared to the parental pathogenic strain hn <dig>  the genome of attenuated s. agalactiae ym <dig> showed significant variations, resulting in the deletion of  <dig> functional genes, which may be the main reason for the loss of ym <dig> virulence to tilapia. the deleted and mutated functional genes all encode metabolism- and growth-related proteins, not the known virulence proteins, indicating that the metabolism- and growth-related genes are important for the pathogenesis of s. agalactiae. the mutations in growth- and metabolism-related genes with the preservation of virulence genes reduced the virulence while retained the full antigenecity. our results laid a foundation for the development of attenuated s. agalactiae vaccine and the study on the immune mechanism. therefore, the present study set a basis for future investigation of the pathogenesis of s. agalactiae and facilitated the design of attenuated vaccine.
