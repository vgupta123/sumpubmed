BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is the most common gram-negative extraintestinal pathogen and the primary cause of urinary tract infection   <cit> . it is a highly heterogonous species with certain lineages becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics . thus, resistant e. coli isolates are emerging worldwide and especially e. coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases  have been reported numerous times around the world  <cit> . now e. coli isolates primarily produce esbls belonging to the enzyme family ctx-m  <cit> . the dissemination of esbl-producing e. coli in hospital settings as well as in the community has been reported as spread of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  belonging to a limited number of lineages or sequence types   <cit> . however, only a few studies have specifically studied the heterogeneity among susceptible, resistant and esbl-producing e. coli . interestingly, dominating expec lineages, like st <dig> and st <dig> continue to be common causes of uti, but are rarely multidrug resistant and seldom associated with esbl production. these lineages have previously been sub-typed by different typing methods showing the existence of several subclones. an abbreviated-multi locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis  method has previously been evaluated and proved efficient in the characterization of local esbl-producing e. coli in hospital settings where the method typed congruent with multi-locus sequence typing   <cit> . however, mlst, in spite of its clear advantage of having an internationally nomenclature, is laborious and needs sequencing where mlva can be used as a fast and low cost method for screening larger population.

therefore, we here present a descriptive investigation of three e. coli populations all from non-hospitalized patients. the characterization is performed by use of a-mlva and subsequent mlst of identified a-mlva codes.

methods
research ethical approvals
approvals for this study were granted by the danish health and medicines authority, statistics denmark  and the regional committee of danish data protection agency. patient notification was declared not necessary by the regional committee of health research ethics committee .

strain collections
the department of clinical microbiology at hvidovre hospital, denmark  provides services to more than  <dig> general practitioners in an area of approximately  <dig>  inhabitants. from the 1st of october  <dig> to 30th of june  <dig> we collected  <dig> e. coli isolates from patient urine samples, submitted from general practices. hence, from non-hospitalized patients, one unique strain was collected per patient and isolates were divided into three susceptibility groups:  esbl-producing e. coli,  e. coli resistant to at least one of  <dig> tested antibiotic  but without an esbl phenotype and  fully susceptible e. coli. thus, in this study we included  <dig> esbl-producing e. coli isolates,  <dig> resistant isolates  and  <dig> fully susceptible e. coli.

strain identification and susceptibility testing
the upec isolates were all identified at species level by maldi-tof ms  and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion test methodology as described in the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing  or by the vitek  <dig> automated system by use of cards ast-n <dig> and ast-n <dig> . methods were performed according to guidelines of dcm in agreement with direction from manufacturers and as described elsewhere . the atcc  <dig> e. coli was used for quality control and susceptibility interpreted as recommended by eucast . resistance to cefpodoxime was used as an indicator for esbl-production. isolates resistant to cefpodoxime therefore had potential esbl phenotypes identified by a double-disk diffusion method; here performed as combined-disk diffusion using a ampc + esbl detection set  as previously described  <cit> .

molecular characterization
esbl-genotyping
esbl-producing e. coli, phenotypically recognized by the double-disk diffusion mast® test, were screened for the presence of blactx-m genes by multiplex pcr assay, detecting alleles encoding the five ctx-m groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as previously described  <cit> . positive samples were re-amplified and products were sequenced to identify the exact genotypes of ctx-m  <cit> .

mlva and mlst
all included isolates were typed using a-mlva, with pcr amplification of six variable number of tandem repeats  loci, as described by nielsen et al.  <cit> . in short, pcr were done as singleplex pcr with unlabelled primers. subsequent size determination were done using an automated capillary electrophoresis system  and a high-resolution cartridge  <cit> . each of the vntr loci was manually binned depending on size and assigned a number. as result each isolate were given a six-digit a-mlva code. for isolates without a measured band size, for a vntr locus, pcr amplification was performed twice for the given locus. the identified codes were primarily translated to sts by an in-house library, but to further confirm our findings, at least one isolate from each identified a-mlva code were verified by mlst, with the exception of one a-mlva code. in groups with several isolates having identical a-mlva codes, we included isolates with extreme band sizes within bins, to effectively cohere clusters. in the esbl population we furthermore included isolates, belonging to st <dig>  for o-serogrouping, performed by glycovaxyn. in all, mlst was performed on  <dig> isolates from the esbl population, on  <dig> isolates from the resistant population and on  <dig> isolates from the susceptible population. mlst was done using the achtmann mlst scheme with pcr and sequencing of seven housekeeping genes followed by assignment of an allelic number from the mlst-database   <cit> .

RESULTS
characterization of the e. coli populations
we defined a cluster as three or more isolates identified as the same st or a-mlva code. a-mlva was performed on all isolates and mlst was performed to link a-mlva codes to an international known nomenclature. used in this way a-mlva divides isolates before more laborious and costly typing by mlst. a total of  <dig> unique a-mlva codes were identified among the  <dig> isolates . in several occasions one st was subdivided into more than one a-mlva codes and complex situations existed where the a-mlva method did not distinguish between two or more sts as has been seen previously with this current a-mlva method as well as with other mlva methods  <cit>  . results from the mlst are presented in fig. 1a–c and a maximum likelihood tree showing all st’s found in the three populations is found in fig.  <dig>  we found  <dig> different sequence types in the  <dig> isolates typed by mlst. we discovered ten sts, not previously identified, here labelled “new st 1–10". we detected a large st <dig> cluster with one a-mlva code primarily belonging to o <dig>  all of which were resistant to ciprofloxacin. a minor st <dig> cluster, with another a-mlva code belonging to o <dig> was likewise detected, but here no isolates showed resistance to ciprofloxacin.fig.  <dig> distribution of major clusters of sequence types among the three e. coli populations. we show sts making up 2 % or more of isolates—except for st <dig> in the susceptible population. single sts = percentage of sts found in one isolate only. a esbl-producing e. coli. sts found but not shown: st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  there was not found a unique a-mlva code for st746/st <dig> and st101/st <dig>  b resistant  e. coli. sts found but not shown: st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  new st  and st117/st <dig>  there was not found a unique a-mlva code for st10/st <dig>  st88/new st  <dig> and st117/st <dig>  c susceptible e. coli. sts found but not shown: st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  new st  and st <dig>  there was not found a unique a-mlva code for st10/93/540/new st and st141/998

esbl-genotyping
we found that 98 % of the esbl-producing e. coli isolates were positive for the presence of a blactx-m. blactx-m group  <dig> dominated with 73 % of all isolates carrying this type and 54 % produced ctx-m- <dig>  a total of 24 % of isolates belonged to ctx-m group  <dig> 

discussion
this study was carried out to describe the diversity among susceptible, resistant  and esbl-producing e. coli. mlst was performed to link a-mlva codes to an international known nomenclature. overall we found st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> to be the dominating lineages among all isolates, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> . the resistant  st <dig> showed a broader spectrum of resistance than the other prevalent sts in this population  , which has also been previously described by horner et al.  <cit> . we found that esbl-producing e. coli, resistant e. coli and susceptible e. coli in turn were dominated by different lineages based on a-mlva codes and sts . in general, the susceptible e. coli population was a much more diverse group of isolates with more sts and smaller clusters . the st-clusters in this population were subdivided by a-mlva, emphasizing a higher level of diversity. the resistant e. coli and esbl-producing e. coli were found in larger clusters. especially the esbl-population was a more homogenous population with fewest a-mlva codes and sts . we found that st <dig> completely dominated this esbl-producing e. coli population, as previously seen in the copenhagen area  <cit> . only a single st <dig> isolate was found among the susceptible isolates and  <dig> detected in the resistant population . corresponding well with preceding reports, we found that most st <dig> isolates belong to serogroup o <dig> and a minor part being identified as o <dig>  <cit> . it should be noted, that the esbl-population is likely a more selected group, allowing us to detect less successful sts with limited impact as upec, which will influence the established representation of diversity in this group. however, we speculate if resistance in different e. coli populations are somewhat defined by intrinsic differences in distinct e. coli lineages, making a limited number of upec st-lineages capable of obtaining and spreading blactx-m. some lineages successfully acquire and maintain different types of mobile resistance genes like st <dig> and especially st <dig>  while other e. coli lineages remain fairly susceptible and rarely take up plasmids, as seen with st <dig> and st <dig>  <cit> . st <dig> could be one of the upec lineages, among these resistant and esbl-producing isolates, with the highest ability to colonize the human gut, creating a high prevalence in these populations. nevertheless, production of esbls are found among specific upec present, to some extent, in all populations. thus, antibiotic selection creates a less varied population structure of related isolates while antibiotic free environments allows for competition and diverse non-related population structure  <cit> . the upec we found in our three populations have been found in other population-studies of e. coli isolates causing bacteraemia, strongly indicating that e. coli isolates capable of one invasive disease can cause severe invasive infections, independent of antibiotic susceptibility  <cit> . finally, our results are in line with the reports, using more than one method of characterization, identifying susceptible st-lineages as more heterogeneous populations  <cit> .

one of the major limitations of this study is the incomplete separation of all sts. however, this also provides high discriminatory power in the ability to separate closely related st-lineages and thereby describe e. coli populations in detail. yet, the missing identification of sts are unlikely to cause bias in our overall conclusion as the prevalence and identification of the major lineages in the three populations are unique. the a-mlva typing method was successful in the characterization and sub-division of some large cluster of st-lineages. the study is additionally limited by the relatively small number of isolates characterized and the limited time period of collection, which does not allow us to identify any fluctuation in dominant lineages of non-esbl populations.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion; this study was carried out to describe the diversity among susceptible, resistant  and esbl-producing e. coli. overall we found st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> to be the dominating lineages among all isolates, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> . st <dig> was able to effectively dominate the esbl-producing upec and seems to be a specialized upec adapted as an efficient resistant and esbl-producing lineage, sustainable in the community once present. the findings we present here strongly suggest that the observed dissemination of esbl-producing e. coli are due to the spread of certain upec lineages already present in the general upec population  <cit> . such lineages seems able to dominate the esbl-population and it is likely that the spread of resistance occurs due to selection of previously specialized upec with limited fitness loss due to esbl-production  <cit> .
