BACKGROUND
evolution of tetrapodes coincides with the expansion of krüppel-type c2h <dig> zinc finger  genes leading to the largest gene family involved in transcriptional gene regulation  <cit> . members of the most prominent subfamily contain the krüppel-associated box  transcriptional repressor domain at their n-terminus  <cit> . the krüppel-type zinc finger domain was originally identified in xenopus laevis tfiiia  <cit>  and the krüppel mutant of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . it is known as nucleic acid interaction domain but can also contribute to protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the classical zinc finger fold consists of an approximately 30-amino acid unit of two antiparallel β strands linked to an amphipathic α-helix with two cysteines and two histidines coordinating a zinc ion to stabilize the structure  <cit> . dna-binding-specificity relies on amino acids within the α-helix reaching into the major groove of dna  <cit> . according to the crystal structure of dna bound egr1/zif <dig>  the residues most crucial for dna binding are localized at positions - <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with respect to the start of the α-helix. position  <dig> is also involved in dna binding, but makes contact to the complementary strand  <cit> . zinc finger domains usually occur in arrays of multiple c2h <dig> zinc finger modules comprising from only a few up to more than thirty units  <cit> . the individual units are separated by a conserved sequence  called hc link.

the krab domain was originally described as heptad repeat of leucines in kox1/znf <dig>  <cit>  and shown to be evolutionarily conserved  <cit> , for review see  <cit> . the krab domain of kox <dig> consists of a krab-a and a krab-b subdomain of which the krab-a subdomain mediates transcriptional repression  <cit>  and the krab-b part enhances the repression in conjunction with krab-a  <cit> . later on, different krab-b subdomains with different properties have been discovered  <cit> . the krab domain, early postulated as a protein-protein interaction domain  <cit> , has been shown to interact with the rbcc domain of trim <dig> . this protein is considered essential for krab-mediated transcriptional repression and recruits various chromatin-modifying protein complexes, thus leading to a repressive chromatin state  <cit> . it is most likely that all krab c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins mediate transcriptional repression in a sequence-specific manner. it is currently unresolved how many target genes are regulated by an individual krab zinc finger protein. in case of kox1/znf <dig>  initial knockdown experiments with kox <dig> specific antisense oligonucleotides combined with transcriptome analysis argued that a krab-znf protein might modulate the expression of  <dig> to  <dig> target genes in a direct or indirect manner  <cit> .

interestingly, functions of most krab-znf genes remain elusive so far. recent reports showed evidence that krab-znf genes and trim <dig> are involved in differentiation and development  <cit> . furthermore, genetic studies linked members of the krab-znf family to human disease  <cit> .

the pfam protein family database states that krab-znf genes occur in all tetrapodes from amphibians to birds and in all mammalian species , whereas fish species like fugu do not appear to encode any krab-znf genes  <cit> . noteworthy, less than  <dig> krab-znf genes are found in the genome of amphibians  compared with the human genome for which comprehensive studies list 300- <dig> krab-znf protein-coding genes  <cit> . thus, krab-zinc finger genes presumably coevolved with or occurred shortly after the appearance of tetrapodes and underwent a huge expansion during mammalian evolution. it was hypothesized that krab-like sequences in the histone methyltransferase meisetz date the origin of this domain back to the last common ancestor of chordates and echinoderms  <cit> . however, this krab-like domain is closely related to the krab-like domain of the ssx proteins that does not interact with trim <dig> and consequently does not initiate transcriptional repression  <cit> .

initial mapping data on kox zinc finger genes already indicated that most znf genes are clustered in the human genome  <cit> . this was confirmed by detection of  <dig> chromosomal kox gene znf loci  <cit> . numerous znf gene clusters have been defined over the years  <cit>  and catalogued to a total of about 60- <dig> genomic loci  <cit> , depending on definition. diversification of znf genes during evolution is reflected by duplication and deletion of zinc finger domains thereby modifying recognition specificities for rna/dna binding  <cit> . individual degenerate non-functional zinc finger domains do occur within a sequence as well as after truncation by introduction of an in-frame stop codon . lineage-specific expansions and losses within znf clusters contribute to evolutionary adaptation  <cit> .

in this manuscript we focus on the human znf cluster at 8q <dig>  that had not been investigated in detail. it was chosen because of the presence of several kox znf genes  for which we have a longstanding interest  <cit> . we sequenced the locus as part of the german hugo initiative on chromosome  <dig> and identified seven znf genes. these genes form a paralog group well separated from other znf subfamilies. we show here that subfunctionalization of the individual members occurred through the modification of structural properties  as well as through fine-tuned tissue expression patterns. phylogenetic analysis in several mammalian species indicated strong conservation and purifying selection of the krab and znf domains of these genes on one hand. on the other hand, gene loss and potential protein truncations in some species also denoted ongoing evolution. rna expression was found to prevail in tissues with high degree of differentiation, most notably in fetal brain. our investigation of the human 8q <dig>  znf locus illustrates principles of znf gene evolution. the znf gene family provides a rich repertoire of transcription factors with distinct rna/dna binding specificities. in particular znf genes encoding the krab transcriptional repression domain represent a great regulatory potential to tune expression of numerous target genes thus contributing to the biodiversity seen in tetrapod evolution.

RESULTS
organization of the znf cluster at chromosome 8q <dig> 
the znf cluster was initially determined by chromosome mapping of sixteen different znf pac clones to genomic locus 8q <dig>  of which thirteen were specific for this locus  <cit>  whereas three clones showed signals of comparable intensities on other chromosomes as well. fluorescence in situ hybridization  on interphasic nuclei and molecular combing techniques allowed to approximate the size and the organization of the 8q <dig>  znf cluster. a first approach on interphasic nuclei was employed to select the closer co-localizing pac clones from the more distant mapping ones. two pac clones, rp5-1109m <dig> and rp4-698e <dig> were clearly delimiting the borders of the cluster. fish on combed dna, performed with two series of three pac clones, confirmed the close proximity of the znf pac clones all along the cluster and allowed to estimate an approximate size for each probe taking into account a 10% variability for the resolution. overall alignment lengths of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb were obtained for rp5-1124c13/rp1-291p5/rp4-718c <dig> and rp5-1109m23/rp4-626a24/rp4-698e <dig>  respectively .

the  <dig> different pac clones were aligned to genomic sequence information confirming that  <dig> znf pac clones belong to one contig. the sequence of the contig is formed by the pac clones xx-p7b <dig>  rp4-659b <dig>  rp5-1056b <dig> and rp5-1109m <dig> over a total size of  <dig> kb . the other nine znf pacs cover the same region. sequence data analysis confirmed the exclusion of the three ambiguously mapping pac clones from the 8q <dig>  znf contig. the respective lengths of the thirteen overlapping pacs have been established and are in agreement with the data obtained with the combed dna. the whole 8q <dig>  znf contig has been filed under genbank accession number af <dig>  individual sequence information of the pac clones can also be accessed at the genome analysis center in jena http://genome.imb-jena.de under human chromosome 8q <dig>  locus. the information obtained from sequencing of the pac clones led to the identification of seven c2h <dig> krüppel-type zinc finger genes in the 8q <dig>  contig within a distance of nearly  <dig> kb . with respect to orientation, two genes, znf <dig> and znf <dig>  show a transcriptional direction towards the telomere whereas the five others, namely znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> are encoded on the complementary strand and are transcribed towards the centromere direction.

gene models and protein domain organization of the znf genes on contig 8q <dig> 
blast analysis of the znf sequences against human transcribed sequences and ests as well as evaluation of the acembly and ensembl databases resulted in the definition of transcript sequences for the seven znf genes. the focus was the definition of the longest possible open reading frame, not taking into account the possibility of different splice forms. all the gene models together encompass an approximately  <dig> kb piece of the qter region. the characteristics of the znf transcripts are given in table  <dig>  out of the seven longest open reading frames for each gene five transcripts encode potentially functional krüppel-associated box  domains in the setting krab-a and krab-b. the comparison of the defined transcripts with the human genome  resulted in the description of the individual genomic organization for each znf gene. the individual cdna sequences of the gene models can be found in the supplementary material . a common theme among the seven znf genes are 5' untranslated exons, the coding of the c2h <dig> zinc finger modules all in one exon and, in the case of the five krab-containing znf genes, the typically separated krab-a and krab-b exons. concerning znf <dig>  we have been able to confirm both transcripts , the one with four 5' untranslated upstream exons as well as the one with only one 5' untranslated exon, by rt-pcr with specific primers that resulted in exon spanning products . both transcripts encode the same amino acid sequences from within the last exon. interestingly, the amino terminus of the largest open reading frame contains a krab-b domain disrupted by a stop codon and exon  <dig> of the 5-exon form encodes a krab-a peptide. in between resides an additional exon, unusual for krab-znf genes. however, there is currently no evidence for a transcript that links krab-a and zinc finger domains in the same open reading frame. noteworthy, the znf <dig> 3' untranslated region contains a row of eleven complete as well as degenerate zinc fingers motifs after the stop codon of the longest open reading frame . the stop codon is confirmed in the human genome sequence , in cdna and est sequences .

searches for further krab-a, krab-b and c2h <dig> sequences on contig af <dig>  besides the ones in the above described genes, revealed  a pseudogene with potentially a complete set of krab-a, krab-b and zinc finger sequences at the centromeric end of the cluster , truncated krab-a and krab-b sequences near each other , an isolated krab-b sequence  and zinc finger sequences at the telomeric end of the cluster . with the exception of kraba <dig> and krabb <dig>  all these sequences are characterized by numerous stop codons and degenerate domain structure .

the domain organization of the proteins predicted from the gene models is presented in figure 2b . the krab-a and -b boxes of the five krab zinc finger proteins are located near the amino terminus followed by non-conserved linker sequences and numerous c2h <dig> zinc finger modules. most of them are in a consecutive order joined by the conserved hc link sequences and equipped with the two cysteines and two histidines in the correct spacing. in some circumstances the consecutive zinc finger array is broken by gaps, e.g in the case of znf <dig>  in such a way that the twelfth finger is isolated. in addition, some motifs are more degenerated, i.e. they lack one of the hallmark cysteine or histidine amino acid residues at the right position or are not complete . comparison of the krab-b domains of the 8q <dig>  znf proteins to several other krab-b domains defining the krab ab or ab subfamilies  <cit>  clearly indicated that they belong to the krab ab subfamily . znf <dig> and the krab-less znf <dig> are characterized by considerable stretches of peptide sequence without known conserved domain at the amino terminus followed by consecutive zinc finger arrays of seventeen or eleven zinc fingers, respectively.

phylogeny of the znf genes in the human 8q <dig>  cluster in mammals
as a first step to analyze evolutionary conservation of the human 8q <dig>  locus we searched for orthologs in other mammalian species by reciprocal blast searches and inspection of the syntenic regions. the region syntenic to human 8q <dig>   in chimpanzee  contains all seven znf genes defined in the human and spans about  <dig> kb on chromosome  <dig> . the gene structures of the chimpanzee znf orthologs are identical to the human ones. as expected sequence similarities between the human and chimpanzee orthologs are very high, ranging from  <dig> to 99% identity on the amino acid level .

the murine syntenic regions of the human 8q <dig>  znf region are on mouse chromosome  <dig> between approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb and on rat chromosome  <dig> between approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. using various search tools like blast, blat and the ensembl database  and the human sequences as input, we were able to define three likely functional orthologs for the human znf genes from 8q <dig>  in mouse and rat . the mouse genes were well supported by cdna and est sequences. with the help of the mouse sequences we defined the corresponding rat orthologs from genomic sequences and adjusted the predicted gene models in genbank for further phylogenetic examinations . the rat gene models have the disadvantage not to be built on cdna sequences due to the rat cdna/est databases being far less comprehensive in comparison to mouse or human. the nucleotide and peptide sequences we introduced in the analysis are again given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> and cornerstones of mouse/rat 8q <dig>  znf orthologs are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

the three mouse and rat znf genes in the syntenic region of human 8q <dig>  are all krab-a and -b box-containing genes. like in human, krab-a and krab-b as well as the c2h <dig> coding genomic sequences are organized in separate exons. gene organization and protein structure  clearly reflect the closely related mouse/rat ortholog pairs and also correspond to the human ortholog. in addition to the three functional znf genes we found sequences homologous to human znf <dig> in the mouse and rat regions syntenic to human 8q <dig>  by blat searches and hmmer search of c2h <dig> domains: there are continuous stretches on the reverse strand of the respective chromosome that are homologous to sequences of the zinc finger exon of znf <dig>  if translated, the mouse as well as the rat genomic pieces would result in "broken" protein sequences of canonical mixed with degenerate c2h <dig> zinc fingers, disrupted by stop codons and jumping between reading frames. these findings support the notion, that the znf <dig> relatives in mouse and rat are pseudogenes without functional polypeptides. hmmer searches did not unravel any other krab box or c2h <dig> zinc finger fragments in these mouse and rat genomic regions syntenic to human 8q <dig> . the only exception was an isolated sequence at the 3'-end of the znf locus in the rat genome that would potentially encode krab-b-like amino acid sequences. since the best hit was the dog znf <dig> krab-b box using blastp against mammalian sequences, this might be the rat remnant of znf <dig> . interestingly, it resides on the opposite strand with respect to the znf <dig> pseudogene. because of its shortness the sequence was not included in further analyses.

comparison of locus organization in mouse/rat and human shows that the mouse/rat region encompassed by the conserved non-znf genes rpl <dig> and commd <dig> is inverted in human such that the two genes reside on the opposite strand with znf <dig> and the human specific znf <dig> in between .

the phylogenetic analysis was extended to all orthologs of the human 8q <dig>  znf genes detected in respective genome assemblies of other mammalian species, namely, rhesus monkey, dog, cow and opossum . with respect to znf <dig> orthologs, rhesus monkey, dog as well as cow appear to have, like the primates, fully functional genes in contrast to mouse and rat . since znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> orthologs are likely to exist in other mammals , it seems that these genes were lost in the murine genomes.

znf <dig> in the evolution of eutheria
the peculiar open reading frame with broken krab domain and premature stop codon of human znf <dig> inspired us to carry out a more detailed comparison of the mammalian znf <dig> orthologs . the chimpanzee has the same 5' exon structure as the human znf <dig>  i.e. out-of-frame krab-a and b exons with an additional exon inserted in between as well as a stop codon. however, the transcript apparently does not even encode any complete c2h <dig> zinc finger since a stop codon disrupts already the first would-be c2h <dig> domain between the c <dig> and h <dig> parts. additional stops can be found just before sequences that would encode zinc fingers  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  thus, the chimpanzee znf <dig> protein, if expressed at all, is devoid of krab effector and znf dna binding domains.

by using the tool repeatmasker  we found sequences homologous to long and short interspersed elements  in the krab-a and the following exon and the interjacent intron of the human and chimpanzee znf <dig> transcripts . this raises the possibility, that insertion of repeat sequences was responsible for the frame shift between the krab-a and the more downstream protein-encoding sequences. in contrast, the znf <dig> orthologs in rhesus monkey, dog  and opossum clearly harbor a fully developed krab-ab domain in the same open reading frame as the zinc fingers. in addition, the zinc fingers of znf <dig> extend to a number of 19- <dig> without disruption by any stop codon. the unusual additional exon between the krab-a and -b exons appears to be primate-specific. in conclusion, znf <dig> is an example for ongoing evolution in the mammalian lineage from fully functional krab zinc finger protein  to residual protein fragment without krab and zinc fingers  with recent considerable changes occuring after the divergence from the common ancestor of rhesus monkey and human/chimpanzee.

phylogenetic relationship of the human 8q <dig>  cluster znf genes
in order to characterize the evolutionary relationships, we constructed phylogenetic trees after alignment of the seven human 8q <dig>  znf genes along with their mouse and rat predicted orthologs. the analysis also contained the xenopus krab-znf gene xfin as outlier and human krab zinc finger genes from different genomic locations. the latter included seven znfs from locus 19q <dig> , recently analyzed in detail  <cit> , as reference group for comparison and in order to assess the stability of resulting clades. alignments were performed with the cdna sequences, the total amino acid sequences, the overall zinc finger dna binding domains and the krab effector domains of the proteins. phylogenetic relationships were then predicted by tree construction methods .

the analysis of the 8q <dig>  members revealed that, in general, the genes disperse into well separated clades/subclades with long branch lengths and often with many nodes in between , indicating relatively large phylogenetic distances and thus divergence times. this was the case for trees based on all four different alignments. in particular znf <dig> and znf <dig> exhibit a very distant relationship to the other 8q <dig>  znf genes and stay closest to each other but well separated by long branches. this behavior of the 8q <dig>  znfs is different from the members of the human znf locus at 19q <dig>  that form a closed clade with much narrower relationships. we also did a second series of analyses with extended mammalian ortholog sequences of the human 8q <dig>  znf genes as well as the above mentioned pseudogene sequences at our 8q. <dig>  locus. the results were qualitatively similar to the one described above in that the different 8q <dig> znf genes with their respective orthologs were always clearly separated in their own clades and not intermingling, indicating significant phylogenetic distance from each other . with respect to the residual znf sequences on the pseudogenes named pseudo  <dig> and pseudo  <dig>  the phylogenetic analysis did not indicate close relationships to any 8q <dig>  znf gene.

the 8q <dig>  genomic sequences encoding isolated or disrupted krab domains  separated in the phylogenetic analysis of the krab domain from the other genes of that locus . however, the krab a1b <dig> putative krab domain displayed the highest score with sequence identities of 56%  with znf <dig> when using tblastn. the krab a2b <dig> 8q <dig>  piece that represents a more degenerated krab domain showed best matches with two predicted znf genes  and then with znf <dig> . thus, these krab domains, especially krab a1b <dig> with the nearby pseudo <dig> znf sequence appear to be distant relatives of the other 8q <dig>  krab domains. they might originally have been part of ancient locus members that lost their function long ago.

despite the distant relationship tblastn searches of the reference human mrna database with the different 8q <dig>  znf protein sequences indicated that another member of the 8q <dig>  locus was in general the closest relative based on overall sequence similarity. the closest human paralog of znf <dig> was znf <dig> , that of znf <dig> was znf <dig> , and znf16's closest human relative was znf <dig> . the most similar paralog based on tblastn of znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> was znf <dig> at 6p <dig> , that of znf <dig> was znf <dig> at 3p <dig> -p <dig> . still, 8q <dig>  members were not far off with respect to score .

as part of the phylogenetic analysis, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates within an ortholog group of each 8q <dig>  znf gene were determined with focus on the analysis of differences between the rates for the different domains, krab-a, krab-b, non-conserved linker and zinc finger array. estimation of these rates was carried out using maximum likelihood . the results for the individual pairwise comparisons of the four domains for each ortholog group are listed in additional file  <dig>  in order to generalize the findings, the average non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios were calculated for each domain . overall, the zinc finger array of each ortholog group showed strong purifying selection  with mostly highly significant p-values. this result was not surprising since the conserved zinc finger framework residues need to be maintained in order to adopt the correct 3d structure. the krab domain appeared to be under purifying selection as well. however, our calculation argues that the purifying evolutionary pressure was generally stronger on the krab-a  compared to the krab-b domain . the linker part of the znf genes/proteins, which in case of the 8q <dig>  znf sequences and their orthologs does not contain any conserved domain, followed neutral evolution . when we restricted the analysis to a stretch of sequence encoding the amino acids that mainly determine dna binding specificity , again, the values obtained showed strong purifying selection as for whole zinc fingers.

comparative analysis of zinc finger dna binding domains
specific amino acid residues positioned in the c2h <dig> zinc finger domain play a key role in determining their nucleic acid binding specificities. based on the egr1/zif <dig> protein-dna crystal structure, helical positions - <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with respect to the start of the α-helix are especially important for dna-binding specificity  <cit> . when comparing these important residues along each group of orthologs , it became immediately evident, that they are highly conserved . analysis of the mutational trends in this region of the α-helix between the 8q <dig>  znf paralogues should help to clarify likely duplication scenarios and functional, i.e. nucleic acid binding residue, variability. to that purpose, principal component analysis of the conservation profile of the individual zinc finger sequences was performed. the analysis is based on the multiple alignment of the region encompassing the 8-residue long stretches from positions - <dig> to  <dig> with respect to the α-helix of each c2h <dig> zinc finger. principal component analysis identifies new axes in a multiple alignment matrix by weighting positions with high co-variation and deemphasizing positions that show little co-variation with other positions. positions in the stretch of binding residues most tightly connected with one another thus reflect correlated mutations that are under evolutionary selection and are more likely to be important for nucleic acid binding. the first principal component, plotted on the x-axis of figure 6a, contains position  <dig>  and the correlated position  <dig> . the second principal component, plotted on the y-axis, is based on position - <dig>  and  <dig> . for both axes, zinc-finger domains sharing the prevalent amino acids in the respective positions are in the negative and genes with mutations in these positions in the positive regions. the sequences assigned to the different regions with the plotted matrix values are given in additional file  <dig>  region i contains all zinc finger domains with a significantly overrepresented motif s s---iq  with frequencies s, , s, i, and q. s-----iq is found in nearly all 8q <dig>  genes . the subgroups in region i represent the motif sq----iq present in individual zinc fingers of human/mouse/rat znf <dig>  human znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig>  and its relative, the motif sr----iq present in human/mouse/rat znf <dig> as well as human znf <dig> zinc fingers. region i also includes the motif s-s---iq found in c2h <dig> domains of human/mouse/rat znf <dig>  and human znf <dig> and znf <dig>  in zinc finger domains of region ii the serine is still at position -2; however, mutations in positions  <dig> and  <dig> have occurred . as expected, residues in the binding region of the 8q <dig>  zinc finger domains are frequently modified to alter or refine their binding specificity; yet, specific amino acids at positions - <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> are significantly overrepresented in the 8q <dig>  sub-family of zinc fingers pointing to a common conserved framework of dna binding.

multiple alignments are a means to compare and relate zinc finger domains. however, the search for the best alignment is often complicated if different numbers of the highly conserved zinc finger motif are present in the sequences to be aligned. therefore, we sought an alternative way to compare zinc finger sequence similarity and thus dna binding specificity: we computed znf motif matrices for each 8q <dig>  znf gene based on the codon-aligned individual zinc finger sequences . these matrices were then used to calculate a pairwise similarity table between the genes . the results argued that the closest relatives with respect to their dna binding domain were znf <dig> and znf <dig>  yet several other similarities were not that far off, e.g. those between znf <dig> and znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> and znf <dig> and znf <dig>  in contrast znf <dig> and znf <dig> exhibited the most distantly related matrices. in order to define the closest paralogs in human with respect to the znf domain we extended the analysis to all human c2h <dig> genes in the sysznf database  <cit> . the computed pairwise similarity tables were used to construct znf similarity networks. the graphical display allowed us to visualize the closest paralogs with respect to znf matrix similarity in a cluster-wise fashion. in order to avoid overcrowding and pinpoint the closest relationships between znf genes we limited the network by chosen thresholds. with a threshold of  <dig>  we found five of the seven 8q <dig>  genes  within one sparse isolated cluster of the network construction . in this cluster another member of the locus was always nearest neighbor as indicated by the similarity values. thus, no other human znf gene was found that was more closely related in the znf domain. the cluster contained two additional znf genes with close similarities, zscan <dig> from chromosome  <dig>  and znf <dig>  that, interestingly, is located upstream not far from our 8q <dig>  locus at approximately  <dig>  mb. znf <dig> and znf <dig> are missing from the cluster and have closest relationships in their znf matrix with znf324b  and znf <dig> . as reference group we looked at the genes from cluster 19q <dig>  again. they too were grouped within one cluster  and displayed higher znf matrix similarities among themselves than the 8q <dig>  sequences. the closer relationship within the group was also obvious from the higher interconnectivity, i.e. the gene nodes had a higher number of connecting edges. thus, despite clear divergence, the analyses of the znf dna binding domains provide evidence for a common evolutionary history of the 8q <dig>  zinc finger genes.

tissue expression profiles of the znf genes in the 8q <dig>  cluster
the profiling of expression signatures provides a means to functionally compare the transcription regulatory sequences of the 8q <dig>  znf genes. therefore we recorded the gene expression profiles of the 8q <dig>  znf genes in twenty-seven human tissues by quantitative rt-pcr and compared them to those of znf genes at other chromosomal localizations . we also included the analysis of the krab-znf co-repressor gene trim <dig> and the housekeeping gene gapdh. each gene-specific assay gives a measure of the relative expression in the different tissues . transcripts of all 8q <dig>  znf genes turned out to be detectable in all tissues, though, the results indicated overall strong expression differences in individual tissues for most of the genes. for the 8q <dig>  genes the smallest overall deviations between tissues were seen with znf <dig> , whereas the highest differences were observed with znf <dig> . interestingly, in most cases the maximal relative expression levels of the 8q <dig>  znf genes were reached in fetal brain, testis, cerebellum and thyroid. on the other hand, the 8q <dig>  znf genes were generally the least abundant in heart, liver, fetal liver and lung. noteworthy, similar expression profiles were also observed for the non-8q <dig>  znf genes tested but not for the housekeeping gene gapdh. visual inspection of the profiles led us to subgroup the znf genes into  <dig> groups, based on tissues with the highest expression. znf <dig> and znf <dig> fell into the testis group, znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> into the cerebellum group and znf <dig> into the prostate/thyroid group. these expression signatures may hint at more prominent roles of these genes in the respective tissues. znf <dig> was left unassigned since overall expression changes were relatively small compared to the other genes. with respect to trim <dig> we recorded a profile that parallels the testis subgroup of znf expression signatures, yet the absolute expression changes between tissues were smaller . since relative quantification of the number of transcript molecules was performed, absolute differences in expression levels between different genes could only be estimated by the values of the respective threshold cycles . assuming similar pcr efficiencies, the rt-pcr data indicate that transcripts of all 8q <dig>  znf genes were much less abundantly expressed than those of trim <dig> or gapdh . in heart tissue, e.g., most 8q <dig>  znf gene transcripts were detectable at ct values between  <dig> and  <dig> whereas trim <dig> and gapdh displayed values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in testis, the 8q <dig>  znf rnas were detected earlier at ct values of about 24- <dig>  demonstrating the higher expression in this tissue. here, trim <dig> and gapdh were detectable at ct  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively.

the different gene expression patterns were compared using hierarchical cluster analysis. clustering was done for the genes under study as well as for the different tissues . as noted above, we observed overall high similarities of the znf expression profiles. expression of 8q <dig>  and non-8q <dig>  znf genes is similar, but different from a group of unrelated genes . the heatmap in figure  <dig> visualizes the results for the znf genes. based on gene expression similarity clustering different subgroups can be identified, corresponding to the manually compiled ones in figure  <dig>  the genes of our 8q <dig>  locus spread into several well-separated clades. among the locus members, znf <dig> and znf <dig> displayed the closest tissue expression profiles. furthermore, znf <dig> was the next related znf gene of 8q <dig> . similarly, znf <dig> and znf <dig> were closest neighbors. znf <dig> is the most distant with respect to the other 8q <dig>  znf genes. this more distant relationship is indicated by a lower expression in cerebellum and a higher expression in prostate and thyroid. this places znf <dig> into a clade with znf <dig> and znf <dig>  the data implicate that many krab-znf genes display similar tissue expression profiles. genes from the same genomic locus with close profiles like znf250/znf <dig> or znf16/znf <dig> might share common regulatory sequences.

considering tissue clustering, fetal brain and testis separate most from the other tissues. the latter fall into three tissue groups: group i with usually high expression comprises prostate, thyroid, thymus, cerebellum and kidney. group ii with usually low expression consists of pancreas, salivary gland, liver, heart, fetal liver, lung and placenta. group iii shows moderate expression compared to the others. in terms of the three germ layers there does not seem to be overrepresentation of a particular one in a group. still, the tissues are made up of different cell types and it remains unknown which cell types contribute most to the znf expression levels.

sequence similarity implies expression profile similarity
we compared the four different sequence similarity matrices with the expression profile similarity matrices. we concentrated on those krab domain encoding genes that are also included in the phylogenetic sequence comparisons . the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the three columns correspond to all sixteen znf genes, 8q <dig>  and non-8q <dig>  genes, respectively. generally, there is a moderate, but nevertheless significant, positive correlation between sequence and expression profile similarities. considering all sixteen genes, the znf domain sequence similarity correlates best with gene expression similarity . interestingly, the correlation between sequence and expression similarity is highest for the six 8q <dig> krab-znf genes. this holds for all four different sequence similarities , but is most striking for the krab domain sequence. so we conclude that krab-znf genes from the 8q <dig>  locus with similar krab domain sequence have a very similar expression profile implying involvement in connected biological processes.

a sequence similarity matrices are based on clustalw alignments  and distance calculations using the tamura-nei method on dna or the poisson correction on the amino acid level, respectively, with the pairwise deletion option; calculated with mega <dig> . based on whole cdna or full protein sequence or the znf or krab protein domains only.

b tissue expression matrices were calculated from the relative quantitative rt-pcr data using pearson correlation distance.

values represent pearson correlation coefficients of matrix similarity comparisons . all correlations are statistically significant , except cdna and krab versus non-8q <dig>  krab-znf . note that only znf genes with expressed krab domain from figure  <dig> and available gene expression data were included.

computational comparison of the promoter regions of the seven human 8q <dig>  znf genes
to investigate if expression profile similarities were due to promoter similarities ), we analyzed the proximal promoter regions of the seven znf genes for  general properties and especially  common tfbs .

the basic characteristics of the seven promoter regions are summarized in table  <dig> : with the exception of znf <dig> the znf genes exhibit more than one major transcriptional start site  in the analyzed regions, three of them even four. the promoter regions overlap with cpg islands and experimentally defined binding regions of the rna polymerase ii core enzyme . concerning classical core promoter elements, the seven znf promoter regions do neither contain classical initiator  elements, nor a tata-box, a downstream promoter element  or a tfiib recognition element  in a typcial configuration in relation to a tss. interestingly, an inr-dpe module can be found in the znf <dig> promoter region, although in an atypical constellation upstream of the tss. the motif ten element , originally identified in drosophila appears to act synergistically with inr  <cit> . though lacking the inr, the znf <dig> promoter region displays this element in a typical position downstream of the tss. also the promoter regions of znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> show such an element less than  <dig> bp from the default location . finally, an x core promoter element  is found properly spaced to a tss in the znf <dig> and znf <dig> promoter regions. this element can utilize free tata-binding protein or the complete tfiid complex, usually in tata-less genes and in conjunction with sequence-specific transcriptional activators  <cit> .

next we looked for common sequence-specific tfbs among the promoter regions of the seven znf genes. we searched for predefined functional transcription factor modules using genomatix modelinspector . this approach is based on the occurrence of usually two combined tfbs that have been experimentally shown to be functionally connected  <cit> . this strategy increases the likelihood to detect tfbs of biological relevance. using a simple counting strategy on the thus obtained data we found eight module families that were shared in at least three of the seven znf promoter regions . the lowest number of common modules was found in the znf <dig> promoter region. the eight module families cover  <dig> out of a total of  <dig> defined individual modules. the module families etsf_sp1f, egrf_sp1f and sp1f_etsf occurred in six of the seven analyzed sequences. certain families of tfbs like sp1-, ets- und egr-families occurred with high frequency in these modules. in order to pinpoint the involved elements we separated the eight module families into tfbs families and individual tfbs . the most frequent tfbs from the modules, found in all seven promoter regions, were sp <dig> recognition sites. almost as prominent was a motif for egr <dig> that occurred in six regions. tfbs recognized by the ets family of transcription factors were also frequent. however, the motifs belonged to three different family members, spi <dig>  elk <dig> and ets- <dig>  finally, modules contained recognition sites for ap- <dig> alpha and ikzf <dig> in five and four promoter regions, respectively. a graphical overview of the tfbs in the modules as well as the core promoter elements is shown in additional file  <dig> 

a modules are functional combinations of  tfbs  <cit> . subcategories were combined to "module families" for counting. for more detailed lists see additional file 14

b number of 8q <dig>  znf promoter regions with matches of a given tfbs module family

summarizing, our analysis shows that the proximal promoter regions of the seven 8q <dig>  znf genes share core promoter properties like association with cpg islands and being tata-less. common tfbs modules could partly explain expression similarity of the znf genes.

discussion
transcription factors are key elements in orchestrating gene expression programs with respect to development and differentiation and in response to the environment. a recent census of human transcription factors stated that out of approximately 1700- <dig> transcription factor genes roughly  <dig> encode c2h <dig> zinc finger domains including, with a number of about  <dig>  the largest subgroup of all, the krab-znf proteins  <cit> . there is evidence to suggest that krab zinc finger genes and thus krab-mediated transcriptional repression initially accrued  <dig> million years ago at a time when the first tetrapod/amphibian genomes were established  <cit> . the znf family continuously grew during phylogenesis with particular emphasis on the mammalian and therein the primate lineage, with often lineage-specific expansions  <cit> . the expansions are considered the result of repeated tandem gene duplication followed by diversification. gene duplication is a key mechanism in driving evolution by providing opportunities for the selection of new phenotypes. upon duplication the gene copies might diversify, thus developing new functionalities , they might contribute to genetic robustness or one of the copies might be lost . neo- and subfunctionalization can be brought about on different levels: mutations in protein coding sequences may confer novel properties e.g. for transcription factors altered dna binding sites and thus modified target gene lists. changes in regulatory regions may lead to quantitative and qualitative expression differences like altered tissue expression profiles. a recent study on a large set of human transcription factors supports these notions  <cit> . both, positive selection between paralogs for altered c2h <dig> zinc finger dna binding domains  <cit>  as well as diversification of the expression patterns between paralogs  <cit>  has been shown for the  znf family. in a study of coding sequence polymorphisms identified in humans compared to chimpanzee, the krab zinc finger gene family was classified as having an excess of rapidly evolving genes, with an enrichment for positively selected genes  <cit> .

here we focused on the human 8q <dig>  zinc finger cluster comprising seven members near the telomere. our phylogenetic analysis in mammals revealed both, considerable evolutionary pressure to keep effector domain structure as well as ongoing evolution: purifying selection on the krab and the zinc finger domains, including the major residues influencing dna binding specificity were indications of the conservation in mammals and thus a likely functional importance of the 8q <dig>  znf genes in biological processes. evolutionary constraints on the zinc finger region and purifying selection between orthologs has been generally noted for the c2h <dig> family  <cit> . in contrast, the lack of functional znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> ortholog genes in the rodent lineages pointed to persisting evolutionary dynamics. znf <dig> is of particular interest. it appears that even within the primate lineage it can encode a fully functional krab-znf protein , a protein with a disrupted krab domain and truncated c2h <dig> zinc fingers  or only a remnant without krab and znf sequences . sequences homologous to line/sine repeats in the human and chimpanzee orthologs might be responsible for the disruption of the open reading frame in the 5' part. znf <dig> remained the only 8q <dig>  locus member without evidence of containing a krab domain in a mammalian species.

since human c2h <dig> znf genes probably originated from common ancestors as products of gene duplication, they most likely retained common structural and transcriptional regulatory features that should be apparent in the family members of established znf clusters. our alignments/tree building, reciprocal database searches and znf domain characteristics revealed that the znf genes from 8q <dig>  generally share higher similarities to members of their own locus than to znf genes in other genomic loci. thus, the seven znf genes comprise the closest paralogs for each other. they appear to form a rather remote genomic locus without close ties to other znf clusters. furthermore, in contrast to other clusters, e.g. the one at the 19q <dig>  locus described before  <cit>  and used as an outlier group in the present study, the 8q <dig>  znf genes show considerably less phylogenetic relatedness within the cluster. one explanation for this relative distance within 8q <dig>  could be that duplication events leading to the paralogs happened quite early in mammalian evolution, most likely more than  <dig> million year ago before the split of theria and eutheria. the high degree of conservation in dog, cow, mouse/rat and human in combination with the location in syntenic regions argues that the 8q <dig>  znf locus is as old as the eutheria. the robustness of at least three members of this locus  is probably due to essential functions that are conserved during mammalian evolution. the znf <dig> ortholog found in the marsupial opossum raises the likelihood that the locus existed even before in the theria. the fact that we were currently unable to define other orthologs in opossum is probably due to the preliminary state of the genome assembly of this species. without data from other phylogenetically older species than mammals it is difficult to assess which gene might have been descended from a more ancestral gene. furthermore, it remains unclear from which ancestral locus the 8q <dig>  locus originally derived.

expression profiles are indirect means for the comparison of regulatory regions of different genes. the recorded tissue expression profiles of the 8q <dig>  znf genes showed overall relatively similar patterns in that mostly the same tissues displayed the highest or lowest relative expressions, respectively. this implies common regulatory principles, e.g. similar cis-acting elements or transacting factors. yet, subgroups could be distinguished, too. a possible subspecialization after duplication, while still showing overlap or even redundancy, was conceivable. in order to gain insights into the gene control regions of the seven 8q <dig>  znf genes we performed a computational comparison of their proximal promoter regions with focus on common properties and elements. there was evidence that the promoters can be classified as tata-less and cpg island-associated as well as  displaying multiple start points for transcriptional initiation. thus, they would mostly fit a class of core promoters dubbed "dispersed" that are evolutionary younger and more common in vertebrates and whose exact mechanisms of regulation by transcription factors are less understood than those of the class termed "focused"  <cit> . the most prominent individual tfbs module discovered in six of the seven znf promoter regions , was made up of egr <dig> and sp <dig>  both c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins. the two factors have been shown to be able to act reciprocally on promoters in this module configuration, i.e. sp <dig> as transactivator and egr <dig> as repressor  <cit> . the interrelationship between these two factors was also shown by in vivo occupancy changes in genome-wide studies during monocytic differentiation  <cit> . spi <dig>  an ets-domain transcription factor also known as pu. <dig> and with essential functions during hematopoiesis  <cit> , was found as part of modules in five znf promoter regions. interestingly, genome-wide experimental investigation of sp <dig>  egr <dig> and spi <dig> binding sites in the above mentioned cell model of monocytic differentiation  <cit>  corroborated the potential functionality of most of our bioinformatically determined sites: we accessed the data through the online genome explorer of the genome network platform http://genomenetwork.nig.ac.jp/. the transcription factor occupancies represented there indicate e.g. binding of sp <dig>  egr <dig> and spi <dig> to the znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> promoter regions, but not to that of znf <dig>  this coincides with our predictions. sp <dig> is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor involved in many processes through transcriptional regulation of numerous genes  <cit> . the immediate-early response gene egr1/zif <dig> also has been implicated in many processes. in light of the strong expression of 8q <dig>  znf genes in fetal brain and also cerebellum it is noteworthy that egr <dig> was described to also play a role in spatial memory  <cit> . since transcription factors have a high potential for functional pleiotropy based on broadly defined dna binding specificity, crosstalk with each other and dependence on cell and tissue specific influences, it will be pivotal to determine the roles of the tfbs detected in the 8q <dig>  znf genes experimentally. the closest pairs with respect to their expression patterns were znf34/znf <dig> and znf16/znf <dig> . our analyses of the proximal promoter regions revealed that znf <dig> shares one tfbs module with znf <dig> and znf <dig> shares two tfbs modules with znf <dig> . this could partly explain expression similarity, but regulatory elements from outside the proximal promoter regions might also contribute. furthermore, other regulatory principles like chromatin organization or regulation by small rnas might also play a role. a next step for further elucidation would be an analysis of the expression profiles of the corresponding transcription factors.

surprisingly, krab-znf genes from other genomic loci exhibited similar tissue signatures as well, raising the possibility that there are underlying causes for these patterns of znf genes. it is generally assumed that higher expression of a gene in one compared to another tissue points to a more important function in the tissue with the more prominent transcript levels and may be connected to tissue function  <cit> . thus, our recorded profiles especially emphasize fetal brain and, for particular genes of the familiy, also testis, cerebellum, prostate and thyroid as tissues in which the examined znf genes might serve important roles . interestingly, tissues like heart and liver display consistently low levels of expression of the seventeen tested znf genes. therefore, one might infer that  znf proteins are predominantly influencing morpho-/organogenic processes of organs such as the brain that have been more strongly modified during tetrapode to primate evolution than liver and heart.

fetal brain is a tissue undergoing complex developmental differentiation processes, notably neurogenesis. testis as well is characterized by a major differentiation program, spermatogenesis. both tissues display, compared to other tissues, above average features of transcriptional regulation: fetal brain and testis belong to the tissues with the highest number of alternative splicing events  <cit> , testis tissue expresses a large number of tissue-specific exons  <cit>  and has the highest frequency of tissue-specific putative alternative promoters  <cit> . a recent detailed global transcriptome analysis of human mid-fetal brain regions revealed a high percentage of expressed genes with a large number of specific gene expression and alternative splicing patterns  <cit> . the transcript patterns corresponded to anatomical and functional subdivisions of brain. c2h <dig> znf genes were sometimes also found to be enriched in some fetal brain regions. with respect to the 8q <dig>  znf locus, most members were not scored as over/underrepresented in a particular brain region. only znf <dig>  along with at least  <dig> other c2h <dig> znf genes, was underexpressed in thalamus tissue compared to average expression in other regions. prominent cell types of testis comprise the epithelial sertoli cells, the androgen producing leydig cells and the developing germ cells, the spermatocytes. the latter cells display transcriptional properties that are conceptually different from somatic cells: distinctive features include use of alternative promoters, alternate starts sites, use of alternate transcription factors, altered genome packaging and arrest of transcription during spermatogenesis  <cit> . involvement of krab-znf proteins in spermatogenesis can be inferred from the fact that their co-repressor protein trim <dig> was shown to be required for the maintenance of this process in mouse  <cit> . in addition to reports on prominent expression of krab-znf genes in testis in embryos and adults  <cit> , there is accumulating evidence that krab-znf genes play a role in sex determination, spermatogenesis and imprinting  <cit> . we therefore assume that krab zinc finger genes/proteins play especially important roles in differentiation processes in fetal brain and testis, e.g. by switching off distinctive target genes in distinct temporal and spatial patterns. in this respect it is noteworthy that krab-znf genes can be found in expression signatures of stem cells and change in response to reprogramming and oct <dig> knock-down  <cit> . a recent publication provided even evidence for the mouse krab-znf protein zfp <dig> as a stem-cell-specific retroviral restriction factor  <cit> .

comparison of sequence similarities with expression pattern similarities uncovered higher positive correlations for the 8q <dig>  locus krab-znf group than for the more heterogeneous non-8q <dig>  group . they probably reflect the closer phylogenetic relationships in the 8q <dig>  group. notably, cdna and krab domain similarity correlations deviate a lot between the two groups. these findings imply that sequences within the cdna and in particular those encoding the krab domain of the 8q <dig>  genes are somehow involved in specifying the expression profiles observed. it is probably more likely that cis-regulatory sequences near the krab-encoding exons rather that the krab exon sequences themselves contribute to this phenomenon. such surrounding sequences might form an evolutionary linked unit with the krab exons.

expression profiling is constrained by the samples and methodologies that are being used. as in many published studies on human tissue-specific expression analyses  we depended on commercial rna samples from human materials that represented pools from different individuals. with respect to the methods, the amplicons our quantitative pcr relied on do not likely interrogate all possible transcripts of a gene nor do they necessarily measure the same isoforms that are measured by microarray applications. a polya-based priming step in many labeling protocols for microarray hybridization is an example: it leads to a considerable 3' bias  <cit> . sensitivity of quantitative pcr exceeds that of the classical microarray platforms  <cit> . high sensitivity is of particular interest for the robust detection of  znf transcripts which are often low abundant. therefore, despite the wealth of published gene expression data, problems of bias and sensitivity affect the expression profiling of  znf genes and result in an incomplete picture of their transcript patterns in cells and tissues. detailed, high sensitive profiling of all transcripts of a  znf gene will be instrumental in understanding their spatial and temporal patterns of expression. as for most other members of the znf superfamily, information on the proteins and function of the 8q <dig>  znf genes is scarce. one study discovered a complex of human znf <dig> protein with autoantigen l <dig> and ribosomal protein s <dig>  <cit> . znf <dig> was proposed to have a role in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and to harbor a transactivation domain n-terminally to the zinc finger domain  <cit> . another report associated znf <dig> with cell proliferation  <cit> . recently, a localization study on endogenous mouse znf250/zfp <dig> uncovered a novel type of nucleoplasmic body containing krab-znf proteins and trim <dig> in differentiated cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our analysis characterizes the six krab and one krab-less members of the human 8q <dig>  c2h2-znf locus as an old mammalian paralog group that probably already existed around the split of theria and eutheria  <dig> million years ago. subfunctionalization of a more ancient presumable ancestor included modified dna binding specificities and qualitative and quantitative expression differences. ongoing evolution is evident from the loss of four orthologs in the murine lineage and truncations of one member in primate species. this raises the question what the primary functions of the lost/truncated genes might be that turned out to be dispensable in some species. the measured gene expression profiles highlight in particular fetal brain as a primary tissue that utilizes krab-znf gene functions. we assume that expanded and altered target gene repertoires in conjunction with diversified expression patterns of the krab zinc finger protein family in general contributed to amelioration of differentiation and developmental programmes during speciation. the expansion of krab-znf genes in mammalian evolution resulted in an increase in diversity and complexity of transcriptional gene regulation by modulating and modifying gene expression signatures from cell type to cell type in space and time.
