BACKGROUND
trace amine-associated receptors  are a class of chemoreceptors belonging to the g protein-coupled receptor  superfamily  <cit> . they have been found in the olfactory epithelium, where, unlike human and zebrafish taar <dig>  they are expressed together with the main olfactory receptors , each by a specific subset of neurons  <cit> . mammalian genomes contain only small numbers of taar genes:  <dig> in mice,  <dig> in rat and six in humans  <cit> . in contrast,  <dig> taar genes have been identified in zebrafish,  <dig> in stickleback and  <dig> in medaka, although only  <dig> such genes have been identified in fugu  <cit> . inversely, mammals have thousands of or genes  <cit> , whereas many fish have fewer than a hundred such genes  <cit> .

ligands have been identified for only a small number of ors and taars; this is at least partly because the methods required are complex and suitable high-throughput techniques are not available. it is therefore difficult to interpret and explain the very different numbers of receptors and or/taar ratios in mammals and fishes. possibly, these differences reflect differences in physiology and/or environment or different agonist distributions. it is also possible that some ligands are recognized by taars in fish and ors in mammals. alternatively, these differences may simply be a consequence of the techniques applied to define and characterize genes. for example, hashigushi and nishida  <cit>  reported the presence of  <dig> taar genes and libants et al.  <dig> genes  <cit>  in the lamprey genome; other researchers carrying out phylogenetic studies suggested that this species had only two taar genes  <cit> . several mouse taars respond to isoamylamine, trimethylamine, and β-phenylethylamine, all of which are present in mouse urine and are thought to act as sex pheromones suggesting that taars may be involved in the detection of social cues  <cit> . in the goldfish, carassius auratus, olfactory sensitivity to catecholamines  and their metabolites has been confirmed, and goldfish may communicate chemically, through the release of catecholamines into the water  <cit> . in the masu salmon, oncorhynchus masou masou, l-kynurenine, a metabolite of l-tryptophan, acts as a sex pheromone  <cit> . if taars are not merely biogenic amine receptors but also have other functions, then the size and diversity of taar repertoires in different species could provide insight into the relative complexity and species specificity of pheromone-based behavior. taars are evolutionarily very ancient  <cit>  and the long evolutionary processes that have occurred in the taar gene family may reflect the evolution of chemical communication in reproduction and social interaction in vertebrates. cichlids, particularly those of the great east african lakes, display astonishing phenotypic diversity: hundreds of species may coexist in a single lake  <cit>  without interbreeding, even though fertile descendants can be obtained from laboratory crosses between different species. efforts to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable phenotypic diversity of cichlid fishes have recently focused on sequencing of the genomes of the nile tilapia  and four east african cichlids: astatotilapia burtoni, pundamilia nyererei, metriaclima zebra and neolamprologus brichardi/pulcher. transcriptomic analyses have been performed and a general annotation of these five genome sequences was recently published  <cit> . to investigate the role of social communication in the development and coexistence of such large numbers of closely related species in the great african lakes, we established the complete taar gene repertoires of these five cichlid fishes. we present here a list of the taar genes identified, and some of their structural characteristics. many of these taar genes contained two coding exons, a characteristic shared by some other teleost taar repertoires, such as those of stickleback, medaka, fugu and tetraodon.

RESULTS
cichlid taar repertoires
we carried out a tblastn search of the five cichlid genome sequences determined by the broad institute  <cit> , with a set of  <dig> sequences corresponding to  <dig> zebrafish,  <dig> medaka,  <dig> stickleback and  <dig> fugu annotated taar genes retrieved from the genbank and ensembl databases  <cit>  . this initial search, with a cut-off of 1e− <dig>  identified a number of candidate receptors; false candidates were identified by a second tblastn search with  <dig> fish class a non-taar gpcr sequences  and were excluded. finally, we performed a tblastx search against the fish database .

table  <dig> shows the number of taar genes identified in the five cichlid genomes  and in the genome sequences of zebrafish, medaka and fugu  <cit> . tetraodon and stickleback taar gene sequences were extracted from the ensembl database and curated by hand . direct comparison of gene content between different genome sequences could be biased by the differences in completeness and accuracy of the sequence data. nevertheless, the numbers of taar genes differ very substantially between these ten species: only  <dig> genes were identified in tetraodon and  <dig> in zebrafish. the other species were intermediate, from  <dig> for n. brichardi to  <dig> for o. niloticus. in addition to “complete” genes, for which a putative atg start site and a stop codon could be identified, we detected a number of pseudogenes and edge genes. pseudogenes are genes with an interrupted open reading frame , and mostly do not encode active proteins. they may result from a mutation changing a sense codon into a stop codon or from the introduction into  the reading frame of one or several nucleotides leading to a shift of translation frame. the pseudogenes we detected were more the result of frameshift than nonsense mutations . edge genes are gene fragments encoding either the n-terminal or the c-terminal part of the protein. their existence reflects the fragmented nature of genome assembly, which gave many contigs of a mean n <dig> size of  <dig>  kb  <cit> .table  <dig>

a large proportion  of cichlid taar genes has two coding exons and encodes a functional receptor . the functionality of these genes has not been conclusively demonstrated, but there are three lines of evidence to suggest that they are real genes rather than the result of sequencing errors.

the first line of evidence is provided by the analysis of nucleotide sequences at exon-intron junctions. the nucleotide sequences present at exon-intron boundaries, as determined by the alignment of the gene nucleotide sequences determined by the tblastn search with their cognate contigs, were found to be highly conserved . delimitation of the positions of the exon-intron boundaries, as indicated by the arrows, keeps the reading frame open. most of these donor/acceptor splice sites were also identified with the fsplice program  <cit>  on the fish model weight matrix .figure  <dig> donor and acceptor splice site sequences. sequence logo representation of the donor and acceptor splice sites identified in cichlid taar genes aligned with their genomic sequences and manually corrected by both mafft multiple alignment and use of the fspice tool  <cit> .



the second line of evidence relates to intron position:  in all cases, the introns are in phase  <dig>  they therefore interrupt the reading frame but not the last codon of the first exon at the donor splice site;  the intron sequences interrupt the coding sequences at an almost fixed position, close to codon  <dig>  within the first internal loop defined by the seven transmembrane domains . only two of the  <dig> taar genes identified did not follow this pattern. interestingly, these two receptors, burtar.a <dig> and britar.a <dig>  have a sequence encoding a different dipeptide at the junction of the two exons. in  <dig> genes, the intron interrupts a dna sequence encoding a dipeptide consisting of an aromatic residue at the end of the first exon and a basic residue at the start of the second exon . in contrast, in burtar.a <dig> and britar.a <dig>  the dipeptide sequences are leu-thr and asn-leu. finally, taar gene tiltar.a <dig> is also an exception. its intron is located just after codon  <dig>  as most of the other introns, but the dipeptide encoded at the junction of the two exons is phe-glu. the basic amino acid is therefore replaced with an acidic amino acid .figure  <dig> 2d schematic view of taar structure. the different parts of the molecules are shown: external n terminus, the  <dig> transmembrane segments , the external loops , the internal loops  and the internal c terminus. the position of the intron disrupting the sequences to most taar genes, corresponding to that is indicated.

of the  <dig> pairs of amino-acids encoded at the splice sites,  <dig> have a basic amino-acid encoded by the first codon of the second exon and  <dig> have a phenylalanine encoded by the last codon of the first exon. the one-letter amino-acids code is used.



additional evidence was provided by blastx and phylogenetic analyses, which demonstrated that these genes encoded true taars and not other gpcrs, which are generally encoded by more than one coding exon. all the candidate taar genes identified by the tblastn search against the positive and negative query sets were analyzed further, by a tblastx search against the non-redundant ncbi protein database. we retained only proteins giving a strong hit with taar proteins and no hit or a meaningless hit with other gpcrs. finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with all the cichlid taars identified in this study and  <dig> class a gpcrs . all of the taar sequences clustered in clades independent of those formed by all class a non-taar gpcrs .figure  <dig> phylogenetic tree constructed with or and taar cichlid repertoires and non taar-class a gpcrs. amino-acid sequences of  <dig> taars,  <dig> non- taar class a gpcrs  and  <dig> cichlid ors  <cit>  were aligned with mafft  <cit>  and phyml  <cit>  and the tree constructed with figtree  <cit> . each group of receptors constitutes well separated clade in this tree.



cichlid taar families and subfamilies
we used mafft  <cit>  and phyml  <cit>  to align the taar amino-acid sequences and construct a phylogenetic tree with the five cichlid repertoires  and  <dig> taar sequences from five other model fish species: zebrafish , medaka , stickleback , takifugu  and tetraodon  . using 40% and 60% as amino-acid identity thresholds for the comparison of different receptors, as recommended in a previous study  <cit> , we identified six families  and  <dig> subfamilies. the largest family, family a, contained  <dig> cichlid receptors and  <dig> model fish receptors . this family comprised seven subfamilies, six of which were common to the cichlids and the other fishes and contained a number of medaka, stickleback and tetraodon receptors. the remaining subfamily  contained only two tetraodon and eight fugu receptors. family b was relatively small and consisted of six subfamilies. it contained eight cichlid receptors, forming two subfamilies  and  <dig> model fish receptors,  <dig> of which belonged to subfamily b <dig>  the others belonging to subfamilies b <dig> to b <dig>  which contained no cichlid receptors. the other families  contained  <dig> model fish receptors but no cichlid receptors .figure  <dig> ciclid taar phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic tree constructed with the cichlid taars  and the model fish taars . taar names are color-coded according to the fish species: till in red, bur in green, bri in blue, nye in orange, zebra in purple and model fish taars in black. the percentage of identity shared by each adjacent gene pair was calculated with clustal w  <cit>  and thresholds of 40% and 60% were used to define families and sub-families . families are designated by letters  and sub-families by numbers . classes i, ii and iii, as defined by hussain et al.  <cit>  are indicated. gains and losses of introns are indicated at the roots of family a and subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the out group made of  <dig> class a nontaar gpcrs is at the bottom of the tree. number above branches are bootstrap values based on  <dig>  replicates, values below 50% are not shown. the scalebar represents the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site.

a large proportion  of the cichlid taar genes had an intron interrupting the orf . the phylogenetic tree drawn with figtree  <cit>  grouped all the cichlid receptors and the other fish taars  encoded by two exons together in subfamilies  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> of family a . these subfamilies contained only spliced genes. visual inspection of the phylogenic tree and computation of amino-acid sequence identity between close pairs of taars enabled the identification of a number of orthologs sharing 99% identity or more. the number  of orthologous pairs was largest between h. burtoni and m. zebra. we also identified four triplets common to h. burtoni, m. zebra, p. nyereri and one triplet common to h. burtoni, p. nyereri and n. brichardi . this finding is reminiscent of our observations for cichlid or repertoires, although the number of almost identical orthologous or genes was greatest between h. burtoni, p. nyereri and m. zebra  <cit> .table  <dig>

gene localization
using rh and fish mapping data  <cit> , we were able to anchor most of the tilapia genome sequence  <cit>  onto its karyotype. we also localized the 66 n. tilapia taar genes, edge genes and pseudogenes identified in this study . all these sequences were located in a single rh group, rh <dig>  which is part of lg16- <dig>  this rh group itself consists of  <dig> scaffolds, the largest of which , contains  <dig> taar genes. within rh <dig>  the taar genes are flanked by four or genes on one side and  <dig> on the other  <cit> . on the rh map, rh <dig> is followed, at an estimated distance of 13 mb, by rh <dig>  which contains another set of  <dig> or genes and edge genes. despite the fragmented nature of the genome sequence available, six tilapia taar gene pairs and one gene triplet were found to be on the same contigs. these genes were all oriented tail-to-head, with intergene distances of a few kilobases . the orientation of the contigs within the different scaffolds and that of the scaffolds themselves indicate that most of the taar genes are located on the same dna strand, with very few organized head-to-head or tail-to-tail . interestingly, the genes for tilapia taars from the same subfamily tend to be located on the same scaffold, as illustrated by scaffold  <dig>  which contains only receptors of subfamily a <dig> and includes  <dig> of the  <dig> receptors in this subfamily. similarly, taars located close together on the phylogenic tree tend to be located side-by-side on the genome, as shown by a group of six tilapia genes . this arrangement corresponds to classic genome expansion, consistent with the cis-duplication event that gave rise to the taar repertoire.

in the absence of rh mapping and fish experiments, it was not possible to anchor the sequences of the other four fish genomes to their cognate karyotypes. however, comparison of the taar gene contents of the largest scaffolds present in each genome sequence and alignment of the most closely related genes, as identified in the phylogenic tree, suggested that taar genes were organized similarly in the five cichlids .figure  <dig> genome contig localization. a large cluster of taar genes  mapped to lg16- <dig>  is shown in the central part of the figure with their names on the right and their coordinates on the left. on either side of the top panel, are the h. burtoni  and p. nyereri  scaffolds identified with autograph  <cit> , these scaffolds contain taar genes identified by phylogenetic analysis as orthologous to the tilapia genes indicated in the central part see for example the orthologous gene pairs . similarly, m. zebra  and n. brichardi  scaffolds are aligned with the middle panel, and o. latipes chr  <dig>  and g. aculeatus  group xviii  <cit>  scaffolds are aligned with the lower panel.



evolution and dn/ds ratios
pairwise comparison of the taar nucleotide sequences revealed the mutations that had occurred during the development of these repertoires; this comparison also made possible to distinguish between silent and nonsense mutations and to calculate the dn/ds ratios . the mean values for these ratios were  <dig>  for family a and  <dig>  for family b, calculated by the nei-gojobori method, as modified by zhang  <cit>  . although well below  <dig>  the theoretical threshold used to distinguish between negative and positive selection, these two values are clearly above the value of  <dig>  calculated for  <dig>  human/rodent orthologs. therefore, they suggest at least a tendency towards positive selection, favoring taar diversification, as reported for other fishes  <cit> . interestingly, there were considerable differences between pairs of orthologs, as indicated by the range of the values obtained, extending from  <dig>  for bur tars.a014/zeb tars.a <dig> to  <dig>  for nye tars.a028/til tars.a <dig> to even higher values for the burtar.b032/nyetar.b <dig> pair, for which one nonsense mutation and no silent mutation were observed. as for or repertoires  <cit> , intraspecies taar dn/ds ratios  were similar to interspecies taar dn/ds ratios , indicating similar rates of evolution for the five taar cichlid repertoires .table  <dig>

conserved amino-acid motifs and other features
taars are gpcrs of the rhodopsin or class a superfamily. they are characterized by a number of features, such as a specific two-dimensional structure involving seven transmembrane domains, with an extracellular n terminus and an intracellular c terminus  <cit> , and several amino-acid motifs; these motifs include the maydry or, more precisely, the dry motif, which plays a key role in regulating the conformational state of gpcrs and is responsible for g-protein coupling  <cit> . this dry motif, located at the junction of the third transmembrane domain and the second internal loop, is the most emblematic motif. we used the meme program  <cit>  to search for the five best motifs in each of the five cichlid taar repertoires and in the d. rerio taar repertoire. in each of the six repertoires, we identified five very highly conserved motifs  at fixed positions relative to the two-dimensional structure of the corresponding proteins  <cit>  .figure  <dig> taar amino acid motifs. weblogo graphical representation of the five most significant motifs identified by meme in the cichlid and d. rerio taar repertoires. these motifs are located as follows: motif 1: internal loop 2; motif 2: tm1; motif 3: tm7; motif 4: tm <dig> and motif 5: internal loop 3/tm <dig> 



in addition to these motifs, the amino-acid alignment generated with mafft  <cit>  enabled us to identify several conserved amino acids, including a cysteine residue present in the n-terminal part of all molecules, a threonine residue in tm <dig> and two other cysteine residues located in the first external loop . we also submitted the total set of complete cichlid taar sequences to the netgly server  <cit> , for the identification of potential signal peptides and n-glycosylation sites . as also noted for other taars and ors, these molecules contained no classical signal peptide, despite being anchored to the cell membrane. however, a very high-scoring predicted n-glycosylation site was identified in the n-terminal part of the receptors . no functional role has yet been suggested for this n-glycosylation site in taars, but an identical site has been implicated in the trafficking of ors to the membrane  <cit> . a similar role in taars is highly likely.

CONCLUSIONS
the main olfactory epithelium was initially thought to detect only volatile compounds. however, following several studies indicating that it also responds to social cues carried by volatile pheromones and small peptides  <cit> , liberles and buck carried out a large-scale search for additional receptors and identified a second class of receptors expressed by this epithelium  <cit> . these receptors were then found to correspond to the amine receptors originally identified in the brain and named trace amine-associated receptors   <cit> . taars are found in all vertebrates, but their numbers differ considerably between species. fifteen such receptors have been identified in mouse, but only five have been found in humans and none have been detected in dogs; by contrast, the zebrafish has more than one hundred  <cit> . all of the genes identified in this study encode proteins with several characteristic properties common to all of the taars identified to date. they all consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane segments, each  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids long. taar proteins are translocated to the cell membrane despite lacking a classical signal peptide. instead, they carry a putative n-glycosylation site , identical to that implicated in the trafficking of ors to the membrane  <cit> . as for most class a gpcrs, multiple alignments of taar amino-acid sequences revealed a number of conserved amino acids at specific locations in the two-dimensional structure. a search with the meme algorithm identified several amino-acid motifs, including the dry motif. in addition to these features common to other gpcrs, a phylogenic tree constructed with  <dig> ors and  <dig> non-or non-taar class a gpcrs indicated that the taar family constituted a specific clade, well separated from those of ors and other class a gpcrs.

the size of the taar repertoires varied considerably between fish species, essentially with genome size, although there were notable exceptions  <cit> : the zebrafish has more than a hundred taar genes, whereas tetraodon has only  <dig>  variability was also observed in the cichlids but to a much lesser extent . there are probably a few more as yet unidentified taar genes because some genes currently identified as edge genes may be upgraded to complete, functional gene status when the genome sequences are complete. this variability in the number of taar genes is similar to that observed for or repertoires  <cit> , but is less consistent with the higher rate of gene duplication in east african cichlids than in other teleosts as revealed by genome sequence analysis  <cit> .

all mammalian and zebrafish taar genes have a single exon and no intron. in contrast, introns were found in 86% of stickleback, 74% of medaka and 61% of fugu taar genes  <cit>  . a re-analysis of the data in the genbank database revealed the presence of spliced taar genes in the genome of tetraodon, albeit at a much lower frequency .

the numbers of taar subfamilies shared between some of the  <dig> species  and the percentage of spliced taar genes have evolved in parallel . however, this parallel evolution is not entirely consistent with the relative phylogenetic positions of these species. in particular, medaka, which has a number of taar subfamilies in common with cichlids and a high percentage of spliced taar genes, does not belong to the percomorph group. inversely, tetraodon and fugu, both of which belong to the tetraodontiform group  share very few taar sub-families and have a very different proportion of spliced taar genes. subfamilies a <dig> to a <dig> and a <dig> include only, and all of, the spliced taar genes . a most parsimonious hypothesis concerning this distribution is that a gain-of-intron event gave rise to family a, and the subsequent loss of this intron resulting in the creation of subfamilies a <dig> and a <dig> 

most documented intron gains and losses have been identified from the analysis of a large number of phyla corresponding to a long period of evolution  <cit>  and such events have been shown to be rare  <cit> . the gain and loss of introns observed in this group of fishes is therefore intriguing. a similar phenomenon has occurred in the development of the olfactory repertoires of this group of fishes  <cit> . a detailed analysis or re-analysis focusing particularly on this phenomenon during the evolutionary development of the taar and or repertoires would be of considerable interest. such an analysis may reveal the extent of these gains and losses, the reasons for these events, and their possible consequences for fish behavior.
