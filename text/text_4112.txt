BACKGROUND
because of the exquisite quality of flesh, grouper is one of the aquaculture species with high economic value. in past decades, the grouper industry has developed rapidly in many asian countries. in taiwan alone, the production volume of grouper was about  <dig>  mt in  <dig>  reaching a total value of nt$  <dig>  billion, approximate us$ <dig> million
 <cit> . however, the sustainable development of grouper industry has been threatened by infection caused by nervous necrosis virus , which could cause mass mortality of up to 100% in the fish at larval and juvenile stages
 <cit> .

nnv, also known as viral encephalopathy and retinopathy , belongs to the genus betanodavirus of the family nodaviridae <cit> . nnv virion is non-enveloped, spherical-shaped particle with a diameter of 25– <dig> nm
 <cit> . it consists of two single-stranded, positive-sense rna genomes: rna <dig>  encodes the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase  and rna <dig> encodes the viral capsid protein
 <cit> . in addition, a subgenomic rna <dig> from rna <dig> contains two open reading frames that encode protein b <dig>  and b <dig> , which have been shown to be an anti-necrosis and a suppressor of host sirna silencing factor, respectively
 <cit> . protein b <dig> might also function as necrotic death factor
 <cit> . the first nnv outbreak was reported in japanese parrotfish, oplegnathus fasciatus  in 1990
 <cit> , and has been since widely reported in various teleost species, including grouper. in grouper, the infected fish exhibit signs of uncoordinated darting, spiral swimming, abnormalities of swimming bladder control, and vacuolation in brain and retina
 <cit> .

nnv infection remains as now a major threat to the grouper industry, despite extensive efforts have been invested to develop therapeutic and prophylactic regiments against the viral infection. extended understanding of the molecular mechanism of the viral pathogenicity can facilitate the development of antiviral strategy, yet such knowledge is currently inadequate. for examples, the infection route of nnv in the host is not fully illustrated, and the cellular response of the host toward nnv remains largely in puzzle. nnv is known to cause apoptotic death of infected cells. recent studies have further indicated a connection between the viral-induced endoplasmic reticulum  stress and the apoptotic death
 <cit> . many studies have demonstrated that virus-induced er stress could determine the fate of infected cell, survival or death
 <cit> . cell which does not overcome the er stress will succumb to apoptosis ultimately. in the stressed cell, the er chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein , also known as glucose-regulated protein  <dig> , functions as a master control to relieve the stress by initiating the unfolding protein response  pathway. bip activates the three mediators of upr: pkr-like er kinase , activating transcription factor  <dig> , and inositol-requiring  <dig> . activation of perk could phosphrylate eif-2α, resulting in attenuation of protein synthesis. on the other hand, atf <dig> and ire <dig> function at the later stage of upr as compared to perk. after being translocated into nucleus, the activated atf <dig> stimulates the expression of several chaperones that are capable of refolding misfolded proteins. atf <dig> also stimulates the expression of the x-box-binding protein  mrna, which would produce a transcription factor once one of its intron is removed by ire <dig>  the product of the spliced xbp <dig> mrna stimulates the expression of proteins that could facilitate the degradation of misfolded proteins
 <cit> . all together, these mediators alleviate er stress by assisting protein folding, reducing translocation of newly synthesized proteins into er, and facilitating protein degradation in er lumen. currently, the understanding of nnv-induced er stress response is insufficient and requires further investigation.

one hurdle to the study of the molecular mechanism of nnv pathogenicity in grouper cells is the lack of sufficient genomic information of the host. the recent advance in the next generation sequencing  technology has exerted profound impact on the biological science research. the technique has been applied in decoding the genomes of several non-model organisms by transcriptome sequencing, providing valuable information in the understanding of gene function, cell responses and evolution. transcriptome sequencing is cost effective compared to traditional sanger sequencing method, and is a suitable alternative to whole genome sequencing as it can provide information of transcribed portion of genes at a lower cost
 <cit> .

in this study, grouper kidney cell  was used to establish a transcriptome library by using the ngs technology. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were obtained by soap de novo <cit>  transcriptome assembly software from  <dig> million reads of raw mrna sequencing data. by matching the assembled unigenes with various databases, we have characterized these unigenes into different functional categories and pathways. the analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> unigenes that are relevant to er stress-associated genes, including bip, perk, atf <dig>  ire <dig>  and xbp- <dig>  we further found that bip could interact with the nnv capsid protein in the infected cells, suggesting a role of these two proteins in the er stress response after viral infection. these data will benefit future study of nnv pathogenicity and development of therapeutic or prophylactic treatment against nnv.

RESULTS
de novo sequencing and reads assembly
the grouper kidney gk cell line was used in this study to generate a transcriptome database. after eliminating read with adaptors, read with unknown nucleotides larger than 5% and low quality read,  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads from total nucleotide of  <dig> , <dig>  were generated by using the soap de novo transcriptome assembly program. by overlapping reads into longer fragments,  <dig>  contigs with mean length of 248bp were combined. the contigs were assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds, which were further assembled into a total number of  <dig>  unigenes with mean length of  <dig> bp . the sequence length with highest percentage was in the range of 100– <dig> bp , followed in succession by 1001– <dig> bp , 2001– <dig> bp , and longer than  <dig> bp .

gene ontology  and clusters of orthologous groups  annotation of unigenes
the gk transcriptome unigenes were annotated according to two functional annotation conventions, gene ontology  and clusters of orthologous . the unigenes were classified into the three categories of go: molecular function, cellular component and biological process, and  <dig> sub-categories. because multiple go functions were assigned to a single unigene in some cases,  <dig>  assignments were generated from the  <dig>  unigenes. the biological process was the dominant category, which made up of  <dig> %, followed by cellular component , and molecular function  . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were grouped into the  <dig> cog categories. the largest group in cog is ‘general function prediction only’ , followed by group ‘transcription’  and group ‘replication, recombination and repair’ . the following groups: ‘defense mechanism’ , ‘extracellular structure’  and ‘nuclear structure’  represented the smallest groups .

expression and functional annotation of unigenes associated with er stress-related pathway
the tag-based dge analysis was performed to characterize the gene expression profile associated with nnv infection in gk cells. the comparison of unigene expression was measured by the rpkm  method, which can be directly used for comparing the difference of gene expression among samples
 <cit> . the rpkm value was compared between nnv-infected and non-infected cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post-infection. as shown in figure
 <dig>  there was slight increase in the unigene expression in the nnv-infected sample at  <dig> hr post-infection, as indicated by the rpkm values scattering toward the x-axis . at  <dig> hr post-infection, substantial numbers of unigenes were either up-regulated or down-regulated in the nnv-infected cells. to further characterize the biological functions that were affected by nnv, the  <dig>  unigenes from the gk transcriptome database were subjected to analysis against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  to assign their functions within known biological pathways. a total of  <dig> unigenes were mapped into  <dig> kegg pathways, among which  <dig> unigenes  were related with the protein processing in er.

analysis of the digital gene expression profile in nnv-infected gk cells revealed that the er stress pathway was prominently affected by nnv infection . out of the  <dig> er-associated unigenes, a total of  <dig> unigenes were affected in nnv-infected gk cells. among the genes associated with the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig>  are main players of the upr and er-associated degradation  processes. these unigenes have been deposited to the ncbi database and are summarized with the assigned accession numbers in table
 <dig>  at  <dig> hr post-infection, several major components of the upr pathway were up-regulated, including bip, perk, atf <dig>  ire <dig>  gadd <dig>  chop and xbp- <dig>  table
 <dig> lists the fold of up-regulation of these genes. among the genes, chop and gadd <dig>  both are components of the perk pathway, were also up-regulated at  <dig> hr post-infection. to verify the expression profile of these major upr genes in response to nnv infection, we performed a time-course study by using quantitative rt-pcr analysis. as shown in figure
 <dig>  gadd <dig> and chop were the two most affected genes at  <dig> hr post-infection, with 6-fold and  <dig> -fold increase, respectively. except for perk, the relative expression of these genes at  <dig> hr post-infection detected by quantitative rt-pcr correlated well with the profile obtained by dge analysis .

expression of bip and the interaction between bip and nnv capsid protein
bip is a master regulator of upr response. the up-regulation of bip in nnv-infected cells inspired us to investigate how bip might interact with viral components in the infected cells. from our de novo sequencing data, we have identified two fragments of grouper bip cdna. the first fragment  represents the first  <dig> residues of the open reading frame, while the second fragment  is of  <dig> a.a., with  <dig> residues overlapped with the c’-terminus of the first fragment . a partial grouper bip open reading frame obtained by compiling the two fragments showed greater than 93% and 87% in sequence similarity and identity with other vertebrate counterparts, respectively .

the conservation in the amino sequence of bip protein throughout evolution made it feasible for us to utilize commercially available bip antibodies to further investigate the expression of bip protein and its potential interaction with viral components. a series of functional assays were carried out with gf- <dig> cells, which has been popularly used as a model cell line for nnv infection
 <cit> . as shown in figure
 <dig>  the expression of bip protein co-localized with the nnv capsid protein in the infected gf- <dig> cells. in non-infected cells, bip protein formed as aggregated speckles dispersed throughout the cell cytoplasm, while in the infected cells, nnv capsid protein displayed both nuclear localization and a distribution pattern of interconnected web apart from perinuclear region. furthermore, bip protein in infected cells also exhibited punctuated pattern and strictly localized to the cytoplasmic area where capsid protein expressed. these results indicate an interaction between bip and the viral capsid protein.

the interaction between bip and nnv capsid protein was further confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay, in which the capsid protein was co-precipitated with the bip protein captured by anti-bip antibodies . this result strongly supports the notion of an interaction between bip and nnv capsid protein. in addition, it may suggest a potential role of the nnv capsid protein in the er stress response. we thus injected the nnv capsid gene into zebrafish embryos to evaluate the effect of capsid protein on er stress in vivo. the splicing pattern of xbp- <dig> mrna was measured as an indicator of the er stress response. as shown in fig
6b, exogenous expression of nnv capsid protein resulted in xbp- <dig> mrna splicing as demonstrated by the production of xbp-1s. all together, these results support the notion that an interaction exists between nnv capsid protein and the upr master regulator bip, and that the interaction is associated with the er stress response in the nnv-infected cells.

discussions
grouper is an economically important fish species, whose life cycle is severely threatened by many pathogens, particularly viruses. nnv causes devastative mortality in grouper at the larvae and juvenile stages, and yet the understanding of its pathogenecity is limited, mainly hampered by the lack of proper tools and fundamental genomic information of the host. the leap of the ngs technology, such as illumina genome analyzer, is a valuable tool providing high-volume, parallel sequencing throughput, thus extremely beneficial to the study of non-model species of no reference genomic resources, such as grouper
 <cit> . the technology has been widely applied in gene discovery, digital gene expression profiling and comparative genomics studies
 <cit> . in this study, we have employed the ngs technology to generate a transcriptome library of  <dig>  unigenes from grouper gk cells. by using this library as a reference, we have identified in nnv-infected gk cells  <dig> unigenes representing genes that are known to be associated with protein processing in er. the obtained sequence information will greatly assist in future studies on the molecular regulation of er response in grouper cells under normal or pathological condition. endoplasmic reticulum serves to maintain protein homeostasis, including the regulation of the concentration, conformation, folding, and trafficking of client protein in cells
 <cit> . many studies have revealed that the viral infection and replication of flavivirus family such as japanese encephalitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and hepatitis c virus would induce er dysfunction and stress
 <cit> . some other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, african swine fever virus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have also been shown to regulate er stress
 <cit> . on the other hand, intracellular stress responses of upr would induce apoptosis in cell if the er stress is prolonged. hence, the delicate modulation of upr would determine the outcome of viral infection in host cells
 <cit> .

recent studies have shown that er stress plays a role in the apoptotic cell death caused by nnv infection
 <cit> . however, the understanding of the molecular mechanism of nnv-induced er stress response is limited. it has most recently been shown that bip is up-regulated in grouper gf cells after nnv infection
 <cit> . while the up-regulation of bip after nnv infection is confirmed in this study, we have further shown that the three mediators  controlled by bip were up-regulated as well in the infected cells. among the upr-associated genes, chop and gadd <dig> were most prominently up-regulated at  <dig> hr post-infection. as both chop and gadd <dig> are components of the perk pathway, the earlier up-regulation of these two genes suggests an earlier onset of the perk pathway. this observation coincides with the notion that perk functions at an earlier stage than atf <dig> and ire <dig> during er stress response
 <cit> .

a surprising result of this study is that bip protein may co-localize and interact with the capsid protein of nnv, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays . furthermore, overexpression of the capsid protein would trigger er stress response in vivo  and apoptotic cell death in the transfected cells . interestingly, it has been shown in a most recent study that bip protein can interact with the rna-dependent rna polymerase , and that the interaction of these two proteins may enhance mitochondria-mediated cell death
 <cit> . therefore, it appears that bip protein may interact with at least two viral components  in nnv-infected cells, and that the interaction between bip and viral proteins is crucial to the outcome of nnv infection. finally, we provide evidence that nnv capsid protein could enter the nucleus of infected cell during viral replication. this result indicates that nnv capsid protein might also play a role in the regulation of gene expression in the infected cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have established a database of genes that are involved in the er stress response in nnv-infected grouper cells. additionally, we have discovered a potential role of nnv capsid protein in the er stress response. another interesting discovery is that nnv capsid protein might play a role in the regulation of gene expression in infected cells as suggested by the presence of capsid protein in the nucleus. these data provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of nnv-induced er stress, and will be of great value to future studies of nnv pathogenicity.
