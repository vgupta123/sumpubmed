BACKGROUND
b lymphocytes play an essential role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. through ligand receptor signaling they differentiate into specialized cells capable of communicating with helper t cells in order to undergo antibody diversification, clonal expansion and immunoglobulin secretion. various ligands and their corresponding receptors are responsible for these signaling events leading towards b cell activation and maturation. among recently discovered b cell activators, of particular interest are the toll-like receptors  and their natural agonists responsible for eliciting direct effects on human b cells. natural tlr agonists have been shown to elicit an innate immune response in human blood leukocytes including peptidoglycan and lipoproteins , dsrna, polyi:c , lps , flagellin , guanosine and uridine rich ssrna , and oligodeoxynucleotides  with cpg motifs   <cit> . the immune response modifier  imiquimod  has been shown to activate nf-κb through tlr <dig> while resiquimod  has been shown to activate nf-κb through tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . plasmacytoid dendritic cells express tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  and are the main type  <dig> interferon producing cells in response to irms and cpgs, respectively  <cit> . b cells are the only other human leukocyte subset to express both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  and have also been shown to be directly activated by irms and cpgs  <cit> . it has been reported that memory and naïve human b cells differentially respond to tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> stimulation, with type i ifn being required for tlr7-mediated polyclonal b cell expansion, tlr <dig> up-regulation, and b cell differentiation towards immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells, but not for tlr9-mediated b cell activation  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to compare and contrast the effects of tlr7- and tlr9-mediated b cell activation by examining changes in gene and protein expression in purified human b cells. the b cell population used in these studies contained both naïve and memory populations of cells but was devoid of pdc. the results demonstrate that cd19+ b cells isolated from peripheral blood similarly respond to tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> stimulation in regard to cytokine and chemokine expression as well as expression of selected co-stimulatory markers, fc receptors, anti-apoptotic genes, transcription factors, and differentiation and proliferation genes.

RESULTS
b cell purity and tlr basal gene expression
b cells were enriched from human pbmc by negative selection and then purified by cell sorting. prior to sorting, the enriched b cell population was about 80% pure, and the final purity after sorting was ≥99% . the expression of toll-like receptors  in purified b cells from  <dig> donors was determined by rt-pcr  and quantitated using the ΔΔct method  <cit> . the b cells expressed intermediate to high levels of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  and about 10-fold lower levels of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  the expression levels of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> were at the lower limit of detection for the assay. the tlr expression profiles from the  <dig> different donors were similar, and are consistent with previously published studies  <cit> . the levels of tlr <dig> mrna were not measured in this study.

characterization of small molecule tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig>  and tlr <dig> agonists
the potency and tlr <dig> vs. tlr <dig> selectivity profiles of the irms used in this study were previously demonstrated  <cit> . at the concentrations used, 852a preferentially activates nf-κb through tlr <dig>  3m- <dig> preferentially activates nf-κb through tlr <dig>  and 3m- <dig> activates nf-κb through both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  for ease of discussion, throughout this paper, 852a will be referred to as a tlr <dig> agonist, 3m- <dig> will be referred to as a tlr <dig> agonist, 3m- <dig> will be referred to as a tlr7/ <dig> agonist, and cpg <dig> will be referred to as a tlr <dig> agonist. however, these names should not be construed as indicating absolute selectivity, since at higher concentrations, the preferential selectivity breaks down, and 852a can activate through tlr <dig> while 3m- <dig> can activate through tlr <dig>  therefore, as was reported in other systems  <cit> , the concentration of test compound used must be carefully selected to observe and correctly interpret the desired effects. the minimum effective concentration required to activate nf-κb in tlr-transfected hek <dig> cells is shown in table  <dig>  illustrating the tlr selectivity of the various small molecule tlr agonists at the concentrations used in this study.

 transfection of hek <dig> cells with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  and assessment of irm-induced nfκb activation was performed as previously described  <cit> . potency is defined as the concentration required to induce an increase in nfκb activation. mec, minimal effective concentration, is the lowest concentration required to observe a 2-fold increase above the vehicle control.

 selectivity is defined as preferential signaling through tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> at a specified concentration of the tlr agonists.

tlr agonist induced gene expression
the expression profiles of cytokine, chemokine, proliferation, differentiation, co-stimulatory, fc receptor, transcription factor, and anti-apoptotic genes were evaluated in purified b cells at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr following stimulation with tlr agonists. the time course of gene expression for one representative donor is illustrated . gene expression was predominantly maximal at either  <dig> or  <dig> hours post treatment. the maximum gene expression for one representative donor is illustrated in figure  <dig> as a heat map. the maximum gene expression data for all  <dig> donors are summarized in table  <dig>

cytokine, chemokine and pro-inflammatory mediator genes
in general, the gene expression profiles of b cells treated with  <dig> μm 852a,  <dig> μm 3m- <dig>  or  <dig> μm cpg <dig> were similar in regard to the specific genes that were modulated. figure  <dig> shows a  <dig> way hierarchical clustering of the log  <dig> transformed fold change of genes altered in expression. the figure shows that 852a, 3m- <dig> and cpg <dig> cluster together, indicating a similar gene expression profile. however, the magnitude of modulation for most genes was greater in b cells treated with the tlr7/ <dig> agonist 3m- <dig> and the tlr <dig> agonist cpg <dig>  compared to those treated with 852a, at the tested concentrations. for example, ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , and il <dig> genes were  <dig> to  <dig> times higher in expression in 3m-003- or cpg2006-treated b cells as compared to those treated with 852a. in other instances, however, the levels of gene modulation by 852a, 3m- <dig>  and cpg <dig> were similar. for example, tnfα and tnfβ  genes were equally modulated by 852a, 3m- <dig> or cpg  <dig> in treated b cells, where all three tlr agonists resulted in 3- to 5-fold more lta than tnfα gene expression. note that the inactive analog, 3m- <dig>  which was denoted as inactive because it did not induce cytokine production from human pbmc in contrast to 3m- <dig>  3m- <dig>  and 3m- <dig>  <cit> , was comparatively inactive for all genes evaluated in this study.

interestingly, some genes were modulated by the tlr <dig> agonist 3m- <dig>  which is likely due to residual nf-κb activation through tlr <dig>  in comparison to the magnitude of gene induction by tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig>  or tlr <dig> agonists, the tlr <dig> agonist generally induced lower levels of the same genes. however, the exceptions were mip3α, il1β, and cox <dig>  which were induced in at least 2/ <dig> of the donors by the agonists that can activate nf-κb through tlr <dig>  but not by the tlr7-selective agonist 852a or the tlr <dig> agonist cpg <dig>  based on the purity of the cd19+ population, it is unlikely that cells known to respond to tlr <dig> agonists, such as monocytes or conventional dc, are responsible for the induction of these proinflammatory genes. however, we can not rule out the possibility that low numbers of contaminating monocytes or conventional  dc were responsible for the induction of some genes, such as il-1β, since 3m- <dig> strongly induces il-1β production from these cells . another possibility is that 3m- <dig> may drive production of cytokines like il-1β through interaction with other systems such as the cryopyrin pathway.

because tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists are known to robustly stimulate expression of type i ifns and ifn-inducible genes in pdc  <cit> , it was essential to eliminate pdc from the cell preparation in order to characterize the effects of these tlr agonists on human b cells. to determine if functional pdc were contaminating the b cell population, the expression of type i ifn and ifn-inducible genes that are indicative of pdc activation  were evaluated following stimulation with the tlr agonists . none of these genes were consistently induced by the tlr agonists, indicating that functional pdc were not present in the b cell population. however, some low-level of inconsistent gene activation was observed between donors, which is probably due to variations in assay conditions. b cell secreted protein values, assayed by luminex, also confirmed that there was no protein production of ifn alpha or the type i ifn-inducible ip <dig> .

the data represented in table  <dig> and table  <dig> are from the same experiment, but were separated into  <dig> different tables for illustration purposes.

co-stimulatory marker and fc receptor genes
in addition to cytokine and chemokine gene expression, tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig>  and tlr <dig> agonists directly induced the expression of co-stimulatory genes  in human b cells . such markers of activation are considered important for antigen presentation and stimulation of t cells. additionally, two fc receptors were modulated by tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig>  and tlr <dig> agonists. specifically, cd <dig>  was up-regulated by these tlr agonists, while cd <dig>  was down-regulated. cd <dig> is an important molecule for b cell activation and growth, as well as being a low-affinity receptor for ige  <cit> . cd <dig> serves as an inhibitory fc receptor for igg and appears to co-aggregate with b cell receptor-bound antigen resulting in inhibition of b cell activation  <cit> . thus, decreased expression of the cd <dig> inhibitory gene is associated with heightened antigen presentation, proliferation and antibody production. interestingly, the degree of modulation for these genes was  <dig> to  <dig> times more in cpg2006-treated b cells as compared to b cells treated with 852a, while they were comparable in b cells exposed to 3m- <dig>  which is a more potent activator of tlr <dig> 

proliferation and differentiation
tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig>  and tlr <dig> agonists induced mrna expression of il21r and myc, and to a lesser extent, fos. although these genes are associated with differentiation or proliferation, stimulation of b cells with tlr <dig> or tlr7/ <dig> agonists resulted in minimal proliferation compared to stimulation with cpg <dig> , which is consistent with a previous report  <cit> . the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-xl was also upregulated by 852a, 3m- <dig>  or cpg <dig>  which is consistent with a previous report that the tlr7/ <dig> agonist r- <dig> enhanced human pdc survival  <cit> . induction of anti-apoptotic gene expression in pdc upon stimulation with 852a has also been described  <cit> . overall, the data suggest that tlr7- and tlr9-mediated b cell activation engages differentiation, proliferation, and survival pathways within  <dig> hr after tlr stimulation.

transcription factors
a number of transcription factors and related signaling proteins were also modulated by tlr7- or tlr9-mediated b cell stimulation. nfkb1a, tcfl <dig>  tr <dig>  and dsp <dig> were up-regulated following tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> activation, while gbp <dig> was down-regulated. again, the inactive analog 3m- <dig> and the tlr <dig> agonist had minimal effects on these transcription factor genes. ikba  is one member of the iκb family that functions to inhibit nfκb transcriptional activity . tcfl <dig> is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor whose function is unclear  <cit> . tr <dig> is an orphan nuclear receptor that negatively or positively regulates gene expression  <cit> . dsp <dig> is member of the dual-specificity-phosphatase family that may negatively regulate stat <dig> signaling  <cit>  and may indirectly modulate other transcriptional regulators by inactivating p <dig> or jnk  <cit> . in general, tlr7- and tlr9-mediated regulation of the expression of mrna for various transcription factors and signaling molecules is consistent with the modulation of cytokine, chemokine, proliferation, differentiation, co-stimulatory, fc receptor and cell survival genes.

tlr7- and tlr9-mediated cytokine production
in order to confirm the changes in mrna expression, induction of secreted protein production from the b cells was measured by multiplex immunoassay. comparisons were made between different treatments relative to the vehicle control. figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> compare mrna expression for il <dig>  ccl <dig> , and cll <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr with protein production at  <dig> and  <dig> hr after tlr agonist stimulation of b cells.

tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists induced increases in both gene expression and protein production for il <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  expression of mrna for all three genes was significantly increased at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after stimulation. by  <dig> hours after stimulation, mrna for ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> had returned to baseline in b cells stimulated with 852a and 3m- <dig>  but was still somewhat elevated in b cells stimulated with the tlr <dig> agonist. il- <dig> mrna exhibited a different temporal pattern, and was still significantly elevated at  <dig> hours after stimulation with tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists. maximal protein production for il- <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> was  <dig> to  <dig> times greater than the corresponding vehicle control group at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after induction by tlr <dig>  tlr7/ <dig> or tlr <dig> agonists, with 852a exhibiting somewhat less protein production than the other two stimuli. the tlr <dig> agonist induced a maximum increase of <7-fold in gene expression and <  <dig> times greater than the corresponding vehicle control in protein production, while 3m- <dig> induced no significant changes in mrna or protein for il- <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  there was a variable level of secreted il- <dig> by treatment with the tlr agonists, ranging from ~20– <dig> pg/ml. interestingly, secreted protein levels of il1β , il <dig>  and il2r  were observed exclusively after treatment with cpg  <dig>  other cytokines and chemokines examined  were not consistently increased by the tlr agonists .

irms and cpg <dig> induce igm and igg antibody production in human b cells
the b cell population in peripheral blood is comprised of naïve, memory and plasma cells. when b cells were cultured for  <dig> days in the presence of 852a, 3m- <dig> or cpg  <dig>  they differentiated, at least in part, into antibody producing cells. figures 6a &6b illustrate the levels of total igm and igg production from b cells treated with various concentrations of one of the irms or cpg  <dig>  b cells cultured with the lowest concentration of cpg tested produced maximal amounts of igm and igg. in contrast, higher concentrations of 3m- <dig> or 852a were required to achieve maximal antibody production. b cells treated with optimal concentrations of the irms produced comparable amounts of igm as those stimulated with the tlr <dig> agonist. however, they produced significantly more igg than b cells exposed to cpg <dig> 

discussion
in this study, highly purified human b cells , containing both naïve and memory populations, were directly activated through tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> and changes in gene and protein expression were examined. overall, there was comparable gene expression and secreted cytokine profile for human b cells treated with the tlr <dig> agonist 852a  or the tlr7/ <dig> agonist 3m- <dig>  versus the tlr <dig> agonist cpg  <dig> . tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> activation in b cells also induced igm and igg antibody secretion in a dose dependent manner. furthermore, 852a, 3m- <dig> or cpg  <dig> modulated co-stimulatory molecule and fc receptor expression, thus priming b cells for interactions with other immune cells . the similarity of gene expression changes induced by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists is not surprising, considering that both receptors use a common signaling pathway mediated by myd <dig>  a summary of the effects of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> stimulation on human b cell gene expression and function is shown in figure  <dig> 

the biggest difference between b cell responses induced by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists was observed in immunoglobulin production. much lower concentrations of tlr <dig> agonists were able to induce production of igm and igg, while peak immunoglobulin production was observed at higher concentrations of tlr <dig> agonists. the maximal amount of igm produced by tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> agonists was comparable, despite the difference in concentrations needed to induce igm production. however, tlr <dig> agonists induced significantly more igg than tlr <dig> agonists. the mechanism behind these differences has not yet been elucidated. however, the differential antibody repertoire induced by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists may have a profound effect on an individual's response to infection and long-term immunity.

despite overall similarity, the induction of expression of mrna for some genes , ccl <dig> ) was more robust in response to stimulation with cpg  <dig> at the dose tested, than with the irms that activated tlr <dig>  an additional difference between b cells stimulated with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> agonists was the observation that cpg 2006-treated b cells secreted detectable levels of il1β, il <dig> and il2r protein, whereas 852a- or 3m-003-treated b cells did not. this could be due to the fact that our pure b cell population contained more naïve cells which respond to cpg and not to tlr <dig> agonists.

it was reported that naïve b cells express tlr <dig> and are responsive to cpg  <dig>  yet do not express tlr <dig> and are unresponsive to irms  <cit> . that study also showed that type  <dig> interferons from plasmacytoid dendritic cells  are responsible for the up-regulation of tlr <dig> on naïve b cells, thus enabling their activation by tlr <dig> ligands such as irms  <cit> . in contrast with naïve b cells, memory b cells exhibited some responsiveness to tlr <dig> stimulation in the absence of type i ifn, but stimulation of their proliferation was amplified by addition of ifn-α  <cit> . although the b cells used in our study were highly purified, no attempt was made to separate the naïve b cells from the memory b cells, and the population used in these studies was not characterized for the relative abundance of these two phenotypes. however, based on published data on young and elderly individuals, the proportion of memory b cells was probably 15–30%  <cit> . if we assume that the prior report on lack of tlr <dig> expression by naïve b cells  <cit>  is correct, then the observation that changes in b cell gene expression was directly activated by 852a or 3m- <dig> in the absence of pdc or type i ifn suggests that the responses monitored in this report were from the memory b cell population. the limited induction of b cell proliferation by the tlr <dig> agonists is consistent with the previously reported modest stimulation of memory b cells in the absence of ifn-α  <cit> .

the data indicate that cd <dig> was up-regulated by the tlr agonists, while cd <dig> was down-regulated, and the degree of modulation for these genes was  <dig> to  <dig> times more in cpg2006-treated b cells as compared to b cells treated with 852a, but not 3m- <dig>  this difference could result from the observation that 3m- <dig> is a more potent activator of tlr <dig>  changes in these genes may have a significant effect on b cell responses, since cd <dig> and cd <dig> are important molecules for b cell activation, antigen presentation, proliferation, and antibody production  <cit> . thus, it is expected that decreased expression by 852a, 3m- <dig> or cpg  <dig> of the cd <dig> inhibitory molecule may cause heightened antigen presentation and antibody production.

it has been reported that tlr7-deficient, lupus-prone mice failed to generate antibodies to rna-containing antigens. tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> also had modulatory effects on clinical disease in lupus-prone mice. in the absence of tlr <dig>  autoimmune disease was exacerbated. in contrast, tlr7-deficient mice had ameliorated disease. these findings reveal opposing inflammatory and regulatory roles for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  despite similar tissue expression and signaling pathways. these results have important implications for tlr-directed therapy of autoimmune disease  <cit> . another study showed that a dual inhibitor of tlr <dig> and  <dig>  immunoregulatory sequence   <dig>  can prevent progression of disease when injected in the lupus prone f <dig> mice  <cit> . while it is difficult to reconcile all these findings, it is tempting to speculate that differential expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in naïve vs. memory cells may have an influence on the immune response to self antigens such as rna.

cpgs were reported to upregulate trail on b cells in pbmc and thereby enhance their ability to kill tumor cells  <cit> . evidence also suggests that combinatorial expression of certain cytotoxic tnf family ligands , fas ligand) on dendritic cells elicits tumoricidal activity  <cit> . 852a, 3m- <dig> and cpg  <dig> all induced tnf and lta expression in b cells, which raises the possibly of inducing anti-tumor activity. in addition to its apoptotic effects on certain tumor cells, the secreted form of lta is believed to play an important role in lymphoctye homing and the development of lymph nodes and spleen  <cit> . thus, tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> agonists may promote anti-tumor activity directly or via other immune mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrate that human b cells are directly activated by the tlr <dig> agonist 852a and the tlr7/ <dig> agonist 3m- <dig> in a similar fashion to the tlr <dig> agonist cpg  <dig>  the findings in this report support the utility of 852a or a tlr7/ <dig> agonist like 3m- <dig> in the treatment of cancer or other conditions in which the activation of b cells may be desirable.
