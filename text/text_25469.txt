BACKGROUND
calvarial bones form by the proliferation and differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts. this process, known as intramembranous ossification, is distinct from the development of the majority of other bones in the body which form by the ossification of a pre-existing cartilaginous matrix . calvaria first form from a condensation of mesenchyme termed the primary centre of ossification. mesenchymal cell proliferation and subsequent differentiation into osteoblasts occurs at the margins and the bone grows in a radial fashion until the osteogenic fronts of two calvaria approximate each other and structures called sutures form between the bones  <cit> . these intervening fibrous sutures act as flexible joints between the developing bones allowing the skull to change shape and grow during development. maintenance of growth at the osteogenic fronts at the edges of the sutures requires a fine balance between proliferation and differentiation. additionally, apoptosis has a role ensuring that the two osteogenic fronts remain separated  <cit> . disruption of any of these processes can result in the premature fusion of calvarial sutures, known as craniosynostosis.

craniosynostosis is amongst the most common cranial defects, second only to cleft palate. it occurs in  <dig> in  <dig> live births and can be associated with significant morbidity, including mental retardation, deafness, and blindness, in addition to the significant social stigma associated with craniofacial deformation  <cit> . the condition may be caused by various genetic mutations, exposure to teratogens such as retinoic acid, mechanical stress, or result from certain metabolic or haematologic disorders  <cit> . non-syndromic craniosynostosis refers to sporadic suture fusion in the absence of other developmental abnormalities and most commonly affects the sagittal suture. syndromic craniosynostosis occurs as a result of simple genetic mutations and is accompanied by additional developmental abnormalities particularly involving the limbs  <cit> . syndromic forms of craniosynostosis commonly affect the coronal suture but other sutures may be affected depending on the underlying genetic mutation. fgfr <dig> mutations are the most common and most severe affecting the coronal, metopic, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures. fgfr <dig> mutations affect the coronal and/or metopic sutures. fgfr <dig>  twist <dig> and efnb <dig> mutations generally affect only the coronal suture. fnb <dig> and tgfbr <dig> mutations have been associated with synostosis of the sagittal and/or lambdoid sutures, while gain-of-function msx <dig> mutations result in synostosis of the coronal and sagittal sutures .

the large number of genes identified as causal for craniosynostosis suggests that a complex molecular network controls suture morphogenesis in humans. in addition, rodent studies have revealed a role in suture formation for transforming growth factor beta  signalling mediated by various bone morphogenetic proteins   <cit> . targeted functional genetic approaches are slowly unravelling the molecular signalling that controls suture morphogenesis. however, there is also a need for a broad experimental approach aimed at identifying all genes and, subsequently, their associated pathways which are essential to suture morphogenesis.

the different phenotypes induced by the known mutations suggest that distinct molecular pathways may be operating in different sutures. this is particularly evident in the case of the metopic suture which, in humans, normally fuses shortly after birth, while the other sutures remain patent until adulthood. this feature of the metopic suture may be explained by the finding in rodents that the frontal suture  is populated by neural crest derived mesenchyme and separates the frontal bones, also of neural crest origin, while the other sutures are a juxtaposition of neural crest and paraxial mesoderm  <cit> . to understand the mechanisms of the fusion process gene expression profiles between the fusing posterior frontal sutures in mice have been compared to profiles from unfused sagittal and coronal sutures  <cit> . however, given that the signalling pathways controlling suture fusion are likely to differ in sutures derived from different developmental origins, it is unclear what such comparisons tell us about these fusion processes. there is, therefore, a need to study differential gene expression between fused and unfused sutures of the same developmental origin.

subtle differences in cranial biology also exist between rodents and humans. for example, the rodent model created for the pro250arg fgfr <dig> mutation, which causes pfeiffer syndrome, develops synostosis of the frontal, sagittal and coronal sutures  <cit>  whereas in humans this mutation commonly affects only the coronal suture. furthermore, primary cells cultured from patients with fgfr <dig> mutations and mice generated with the same mutations show differing proliferation and differentiation characteristics . these differences emphasise that mechanisms controlling rodent suture morphogenesis do not exactly mimic those occurring in human sutures.

in this study we have analysed global in vivo expression differences between fused, fusing, and unfused sutures from patients with craniosynostosis to identify genes which are involved in maintaining suture patency and driving suture fusion within each human suture.

RESULTS
five patients were recruited to the gene identification stage of this study, one diagnosed with syndromic craniosynostosis  and four with non-syndromic craniosynostosis . sixteen suture samples were obtained from these patients for microarray analysis; nine from unfused sutures, two from fusing, and five from fused sutures . to minimise any age-related changes and to eliminate any sex-related effects on the development of craniosynostosis, sutures were obtained from males aged 3- <dig> months. the stage of fusion was confirmed by 3d computer tomography , microct, and histological analysis and classified as unfused, fusing, or fused . we performed microarray analyses on rna isolated from sutures resected at surgery using the affymetrix human u133a  <dig>  genechip platform containing ~ <dig>  gene transcripts. microarray data were initially assessed using a number of quality control measures . rna digestion plots indicated that all samples showed a high similarity in rna quality except for one unfused sagittal sample from patient # <dig> . nuse and mbox plots indicated that this sample had a similar expression intensity compared to other samples but had elevated standard errors. we were initially cautious in our interpretation of any particular difference in expression seen with this sample.

ctwo samples of varying degrees of fusion were obtained. the sample which was at the earlier stage of fusion was used for validation qrt-pcr; the sample at a later stage of fusion was used for within patient comparison only.

patient genetic background does not adversely affect gene expression
hierarchical clustering, based on whole genome expression, showed samples typically grouped according to stage of fusion or suture type, and not solely by patient of origin, indicating no adverse patient-specific genetic background biases existed . importantly, sutures from the apert syndrome patient grouped more closely with similar sutures from other non-syndromic patients, than they did to each other. these similarities in gene expression between syndromic and non-syndromic patients were confirmed with additional syndromic samples using realtime quantitative rt-pcr , as described later. this indicates that patient genetic background does not overly impact on gene expression and it provides proof of principle that the combined analysis of syndromic and non-syndromic patient samples can be applied in the study of general mechanisms of craniosynostosis.

metopic sutures have different gene expression profiles to other sutures
the neural crest origin of the metopic suture mesenchyme, compared to the predominantly mesodermal origin of the other sutures may result in the metopic suture, exhibiting significantly different expression profiles to the other suture types. we therefore initially analysed differential gene expression between fused and unfused sutures treating metopic sutures separately. microarray expression data were combined for all unfused  and all fusing/fused  sutures, from the sagittal, coronal and lambdoid sutures and differential expression was analysed between the two groups. initially, a subset of differentially expressed probe sets was selected based on those with a multiple testing corrected p <  <dig>   in order to assess how well the analysis separated the two groups of interest. this minimally-selective p-value was chosen to remove a large number of those genes which were not modulated in the two tissue types. pair-wise correlation of all samples to an arbitrarily chosen unfused suture sample  showed that samples were separated based on stage of fusion using the chosen gene subset, with a gradient of relatedness seen for unfused, fusing, and fused tissues . furthermore, the unfused metopic suture grouped with the fused tissues, suggesting that metopic suture mesenchyme has an expression profile more similar to fused tissue. this result vindicated our exclusion of metopic suture samples from statistical analyses of differential expression between unfused and fused samples. all other unfused sutures showed a very high correlation in expression between themselves, whereas fused and fusing sutures were more disparate in expression profiles. this broader distribution of fusing and fused sutures may indicate that they were undergoing pathologic fusion of different aetiologies and/or that they were at different stages of the fusion process. additionally, there was evidence for suture-specific expression, with the unfused sagittal sutures being slightly less correlated to unfused coronal sutures than were unfused lambdoid sutures. this difference was later analysed by comparing expression solely between each unfused suture type; however by pooling unfused sutures for the initial analyses we were also able to identify those genes commonly involved in morphogenesis of all sutures.

hierarchical clustering based on the selected subset of genes clearly showed that suture tissue samples formed two clusters, mirroring two states of fusion: fused/fusing and unfused . this suggests that fusing sutures are generally more similar to fused than unfused sutures and that it is appropriate to group them together for analyses. it was also noted that in both plots in figure  <dig>  sample us <dig>  despite rna quality concerns, grouped most closely with the other unfused sagittal suture and thus it was appropriate to include this sample in further analyses.

genes differentially expressed between fused and unfused sutures
based on a linear regression analysis of genes differentially expressed between the unfused group of sutures and the group of fusing/fused sutures,  <dig> genes were significantly  differentially expressed . irrespective of p-value, a greater than 2-fold expression difference was found for  <dig> probe sets;  <dig> were "increased" and  <dig> were "decreased" in unfused compared to fusing/fused sutures . amongst those genes increased in unfused sutures were fgfr <dig>  tgfb <dig>  and epidermal growth factor receptor  . all have been previously linked with calvarial development and, in the case of fgfr <dig>  with craniosynostosis  <cit> . thirty two of these  <dig> probe sets , representing  <dig> genes, had a significant difference in expression , suggesting that these are important in the morphogenesis of all sutures. all, except one, were increased in unfused sutures. the identification of such a small number of significantly expressed genes across all suture types is likely due to the fact that different suture types, which may have slightly different gene expression profiles, were combined for the analysis. as we did not want to reject any potentially important genes, including those expressed to varying degrees in different sutures, we carried out further analyses using the genes in the 2-fold list, irrespective of their p-value. importantly, however, we recognise that those genes with a p <  <dig>  are more likely to be key regulators of suture morphogenesis, rather than specific to one suture type.

twenty-eight genes were identified as being significantly  differentially expressed in unfused sutures compared to fused/fusing sutures. genes are listed in order of significance with fold change relative to unfused sutures.

gene expression fold change  is presented for unfused sutures  compared to fused/fusing sutures , with corresponding p-values, and for combined unfused coronal  and unfused sagittal  sutures compared to unfused lambdoid sutures .

to further categorise the 2-fold differentially-expressed gene list, gene ontology  over-representation was analysed. biological processes enriched in the 2-fold gene list are shown in table  <dig>  genes with higher expression in unfused sutures were found to significantly over-represent processes such as mesoderm formation, skeletal development, cell adhesion, cell surface receptor signalling, and extracellular matrix organisation, consistent with genes involved in regulating suture morphogenesis. surprisingly, we also noted an extremely significant over-representation within those genes with higher expression in fusing/fused sutures of genes involved in the response to biotic stimuli  and the immune response . as fold change is not the only useful characteristic, go over-representation analysis was also conducted irrespective of fold change for all probe sets with a minimally selective p <  <dig>   and similar categories were identified.

classification of gene ontologies  significantly over-represented  for genes at least  <dig> fold differentially expressed between unfused and fused sutures, listed under level  <dig> go category headings. not all level three go categories listed were significantly over-represented and thus do not have a p-value

gene set enrichment analysis  was then used to asses the significance of this set of differentially expressed genes at the molecular level. the ranked list of 2-fold differentially expressed genes was compared with a curated database consisting of molecular pathways and publicly available microarray experiments . such a comparison identifies which molecular pathways share a group of genes with our identified gene list, providing a potential insight into involved biological networks. those gene sets which were significantly correlated  to genes increased in unfused sutures included genes with activating transcription factor  <dig>  and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor  <dig>  binding motifs within  <dig> kb of their transcription start sites, genes up-regulated by tgfβ, genes up-regulated in haematopoietic stem cells, genes up-regulated in cd <dig> negative stromal stem cells which differentiate into bone cells, and genes down-regulated upon cytomegalovirus  infection. this final gene set makes a connection between those genes down-regulated during suture fusion  and genes down-regulated during infection. this integrated well with the gene sets which were significantly correlated with those genes increased during fusion; these included genes up-regulated in liver in graft verses host disease , genes up-regulated in pulpal tissue from carious teeth, and genes up-regulated during retinoic acid induced promyelocytic differentiation. these observations are consistent with our previous gsea observations in a microarray comparison between fused sutures tissue and de-differentiated explant cells, where we again found an increase in expression of immune response genes in fused suture tissues  <cit> . it is possible that these immune response genes reflect the formation of bone marrow within the fused bone matrix. in support of this, microscopy revealed a large accumulation of lymphocytes and other white blood cells within the calvarial bones . a second explanation may be that premature fusion is functionally associated with an immune response to infection, either directly or indirectly, as it is known that various immunoregulatory cytokines influence bone homeostasis and that osteoblasts may facilitate immune responses by producing immunomodulatory molecules .

results were then analysed on a gene-based level. one of the families of genes which were significantly over-represented in unfused sutures was eph/ephrin signalling molecules. these form a pathway recently invoked in causing craniosynostosis  <cit> . specifically, we found that three ephrin receptor genes had higher expression in unfused sutures . multiple genes from several other gene families were also increased in unfused sutures . these include small leucine-rich proteoglycans , a group of secreted proteins that are known to be involved in cartilage and bone formation through facilitating collagen fibril binding to the emc  <cit>  and regulating tgfβ activity by sequestering tgfβ in the ecm, thus preventing binding to cell surface receptors  <cit> . such genes were, proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein , osteoglycin , fibromodulin  and decorin .

a large over-representation of collagen genes was also observed. in particular, collagen type ii, iii, vi, viii, x, and xi were all up-regulated in unfused sutures. interestingly, collagen type ii and x are generally associated with cartilage formation, and would not be expected to be expressed during intramembranous ossification. however, a number of other cartilage-specific genes were also increased in unfused sutures  suggesting that there may be a role for cartilage in calvarial suture morphogenesis. additional secreted matrix proteins that were over-expressed in unfused suture tissue included pleiotrophin ) and periostin ). ptn has been identified in osteoblasts undergoing early stages of differentiation and is a potent regulator of osteoblast proliferation, recruitment, and differentiation  <cit> . postn is also expressed by early osteoblasts and is a target of twist <dig> transcriptional regulation in mice  <cit> . a number of proteases and protease inhibitors were also differentially expressed between unfused and fused suture tissue including, mmp <dig> , mmp <dig> , mmp <dig> , mme , serpina <dig> , serpinb <dig>  and timp <dig>  .

numerous genes involved in wnt signalling were also identified; glypican  <dig>  and frizzled  <dig>  were increased in unfused sutures, while wnt inhibitory factor  <dig>  was increased in fused sutures. previously, we have identified an up-regulation of wif <dig> in human fused suture tissue when comparing in vivo expression to expression of de-differentiated explant cells  <cit> . these results are consistent with the recent observations that activation of canonical wnt signalling is important in osteoblast expansion and differentiation  <cit> , and that antagonist of wnt signalling are essential to initiate terminal osteoblasts differentiation  <cit> .

a number of the genes differentially expressed between fused, fusing, and unfused sutures which had a large significant  fold change  had not been previously identified to be expressed in human calvaria. of particular interest were retinol-binding protein  <dig> , c1q and tumour necrosis factor related protein  <dig> , microfibrillar-associated protein  <dig> , prelp , gpc <dig> , tenascin n , pleiotrophin  and interleukin  <dig> receptor alpha . the significant expression of all these genes for the combined suture comparison suggests that they are likely to be key regulators of morphogenesis in all sutures.

unfused sagittal sutures have a lower expression of the 'unfused' class of genes
to analyse the effect of suture type on gene expression we used two methods of analysis to compare global expression data between unfused coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures. we then compared results from the two methods to identify the most robust set of differentially expressed genes. for the 3-way analysis we used a linear modelling approach to jointly perform three pair-wise comparisons: coronal vs sagittal, lambdoid vs sagittal, and lambdoid vs coronal and we then identified where these groups overlapped . this pooled approach provides greater sensitivity and statistical power over multiple direct comparisons. unfused sagittal sutures were found to have  <dig> probe sets differentially expressed when compared to coronal sutures and  <dig> when compared to lambdoid sutures, while the coronal and lambdoid sutures only had  <dig> probes sets differentially expressed between each other. furthermore,  <dig> of those probe sets differentially expressed in unfused sagittal were not differentially expressed between the coronal and lambdoid sutures. this supported the higher correlation of gene expression of differentially expressed genes between unfused coronal and lambdoid sutures seen in figure  <dig>  of these  <dig> probe sets,  <dig> were increased in unfused coronal and lambdoid sutures and  <dig> were decreased, compared to the sagittal sutures . the 3-way analysis also showed that  <dig> probe sets were uniquely expressed in unfused lambdoid sutures compared to coronal and sagittal sutures .

to control for patient-specific effects we performed a set of separate pair-wise comparisons using a matched pairs design. in this case we first restricted analysis to patients with a sample from each of the sutures of interest and then performed analysis on the within patient differences. a list of significant genes with p <  <dig>  was produced from each pair-wise comparison .

the combination of the 3-way and pair-wise comparisons identified  <dig> probe sets significantly  differentially expressed in unfused sagittal sutures compared to unfused coronal and lambdoid sutures. amongst the top ten genes, seven had higher expression in unfused sagittal sutures and two had lower expression compared to coronal and lambdoid sutures . outside the top ten, genes with significantly decreased expression in unfused sagittal sutures were fgfr <dig>  msx <dig>  gpc <dig>  and wnt5a, while the wnt inhibitor wif <dig> had increased expression. the observed trend was that unfused sagittal sutures have a lower expression of those genes typically associated with an unfused suture state and a higher expression of genes associated with suture fusion .

unfused coronal and sagittal sutures have differential expression of transcription factors compared to lambdoid sutures
analysis of the unfused-suture comparison data with respect to genes differentially expressed by unfused lambdoid sutures identified a large number of transcription factors. those down-regulated with respect to coronal and sagittal sutures included fos, fosb, jun, junb, and cart1; all having a tendency for greater expression in the coronal suture . those genes with higher expression in unfused lambdoid sutures included transcription factors foxd <dig>  meox <dig>  hlf and bhlh <dig> 

microarray results validated by real-time quantitative rt-pcr and western blot
results from the microarray analysis were validated by qrt-pcr for  <dig> of the most highly expressed and significantly differentially expressed genes: eight genes increased in unfused suture tissue, rbp <dig>  c1qtnf <dig>  prelp, gpc <dig>  ptn, fmod, col3a <dig>  and col8a2; and  <dig> genes increased in fusing/fused suture tissue, wif <dig>  anxa <dig>  and cyfip <dig>  the affymetrix probe set for c1qtnf <dig> targeted two transcripts and therefore two transcript-specific primers sets were designed. gene expression was analysed using  <dig> of the same rna samples which underwent microarray analysis . a linear correlation was calculated for each transcript for the comparison of expression values obtained by qrt-pcr and microarray analysis . an average correlation of 90% was observed for all genes analysed, validating the microarray results. three primer sets had a correlation coefficient smaller than 75%; however, two of these primer sets did not amplify all isoforms detected by their corresponding affymetrix probe set. the third primer set was designed to detect the long isoform of c1qtnf <dig>  while this had a correlation of 74%, the short isoform c1qtnf <dig> primers had 99% correlation, suggesting that it is the short isoform of c1qtnf <dig> that is differentially expressed.

the average correlation for all probe sets is approximately 90%, not including the correlation of the long isoform of c1qtnf <dig>  the short isoform of c1qtnf <dig> had 99% correlation, indicating that the short and not the long isoform of c1qtnf <dig> is differentially expressed between unfused and fused sutures.

to further examine the differential expression of genes between fused, fusing and unfused sutures identified by microarray analysis we used qrt-pcr to quantify expression of all genes noted above using the  <dig> validation samples and  <dig> additional samples from  <dig> new patients . although the initial microarray hierarchical clustering analyses  indicated there was limited difference in whole genome expression between non-syndromic and syndromic samples, this analysis only included samples from one syndromic patient. we therefore extended this comparison by analysing qrt-pcr data obtained from the larger cohort of patients which included  <dig> syndromic patients, and  <dig> non-syndromic patients in total. no significant difference  in gene expression was seen between non-syndromic and syndromic samples, when separated into unfused, fusing, and fused states . this result clearly demonstrates that samples of different aetiologies can be combined to investigate the general mechanisms of craniosynostosis.

as the unfused suture samples which underwent microarray and qrt-pcr analyses were obtained from patients with craniosynostosis, there is the possibility that their gene expression profiles do not truly represent an unfused suture from an individual without craniosynostosis. consequently, the expression of the above mentioned genes were analysed in unfused coronal, lambdoid, and metopic sutures obtained from similar age-matched individuals who were undergoing transcranial surgery for reasons other than craniosynostosis . no significant difference  in gene expression was observed for these unfused non-craniosynostosis sutures, compared to unfused sutures from individuals with craniosynostosis . this provides proof of principle that the analysis of gene expression profiles from unfused sutures from craniosynostosis patients is useful in the study of suture morphogenesis.

qrt-pcr data was then compared between unfused, fusing, and fused samples from each suture site, combing non-syndromic and syndromic patients together. differential expression profiles were observed for all  <dig> genes analysed, although the level of differential expression varied between suture sites . the greatest difference in expression was observed for coronal sutures, followed closely by lambdoid sutures, while metopic sutures had, in general, the smallest changes in expression between unfused and fused sutures. this later observation is likely due to the finding that unfused metopic sutures generally had a lower level of expression of genes increased in unfused sutures  and a higher expression of genes which were increased in fused sutures . unfused sagittal sutures also showed higher expression than unfused coronal and lambdoid sutures for those genes increased in fused sutures  . these combined patient results confirmed the suture-specific analyses outlined earlier . the qrt-pcr validation experiment also demonstrated a variable gradient of expression between unfused, fusing, and fused samples for all genes analysed . however, this gradient of expression is best analysed using samples isolated from the same sutures from the same patient that are undergoing various stages of fusion. figure  <dig> shows the qrt-pcr data from  <dig> samples isolated from one apert syndrome patient . two fusing coronal samples were isolated from this patient, one during the early stages and one during the later stages of fusion, along with a fully fused coronal suture and unfused sagittal and metopic sutures. the data shows that anxa <dig> and cyfip <dig> are increased in fusing sutures, but are further increased in fully fused sutures, whereas wif <dig> has the greatest expression in fusing sutures and is slightly decreased once the suture is fully fused, however this level remains above unfused sutures. this subtle difference cannot be seen in figure 6a where fusing sutures of different stages from different patients are grouped together. figure  <dig> also again highlights the difference in expression of unfused metopic sutures, being closer in expression to fusing sutures than other unfused sutures for a number of genes.

differential protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis for three genes with increased expression in unfused sutures, rbp <dig>  c1qtnf <dig> and gpc <dig> . microarray results indicated that collagen type i alpha  <dig> was the most abundant transcript and was not differentially expressed between unfused and fused suture tissues . protein expression was therefore normalised to col <dig> for comparative quantification. all three proteins were differentially expressed in a similar pattern to that observed for the rna expression data, with a decreasing gradient of expression observed for unfused, fusing, and then fused samples. again, lower expression of each protein was observed in unfused metopic sutures. higher protein expression was observed in two fused sagittal sutures  compared to two other fused sagittal sutures . this may be explained in part by tissue structure. during sample preparation it was noted that # <dig> and # <dig> sutures were very thin, flat bones more representative of developed calvaria, while # <dig> and # <dig> were more archetypal, having enlarged fused-suture ridges  <cit> .

unfused lambdoid sutures express cartilage-specific markers
increased expression of col10a <dig> and col2a <dig> was identified in unfused lambdoid sutures and one  of the two unfused sagittal sutures compared to all other samples . the unfused sagittal suture from patient # <dig> was taken from the extreme posterior portion of the suture very close to the lambdoid suture . in all other gene expression analyses this sample grouped with the other unfused sagittal suture, verifying its correct classification as sagittal suture tissue. the expression of cartilage-specific collagens suggested, contrary to conventional thinking, that cartilage may play a role in human suture morphogenesis. histological analysis of fused and unfused lambdoid, coronal, and sagittal sutures from additional patients to those used for microarray analyses , identified cartilage only in unfused lambdoid sutures . cartilage was found at the tips of the osteogenic fronts which protruded into the suture mesenchyme. this cartilaginous region was composed of what histologically appeared to be a region of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes, and was seen to protrude into the osteoblastic region where calcification was occurring to form calvarial bone . the spatial expression of colx protein, which is a specific marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes  <cit> , was investigated by confocal immunofluorescence . colx was found to be highly abundant in osteoclasts, which were localised to the edges of the cartilage matrix adjacent to the bone matrix. colx was also expressed, but more weakly, by chondrocytes in the cartilage matrix . colx expression was not identified in any other suture type .

different spatial localisation of rbp <dig> and gpc <dig> in unfused sutures
tissue localisation of rbp <dig> and gpc <dig> was investigated using confocal microscopy in fused and unfused tissue from coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures . in all unfused sutures, rbp <dig> was located in the cytoplasm, the most intense staining being in osteocytes in the outermost region of bone overlying the suture region on the ectocranial but not the endocranial surface . rbp <dig> expression was also observed in osteoblasts at the osteogenic fronts , those invaginating the osteoid, and by osteocytes at the bone margin , but not in osteocytes distal from the suture region. in the lambdoid sutures, rbp <dig> expression was also high in osteoblastic cells lining the cartilage fronts. no specific staining was observed in fused sutures .

glypican  <dig> was most highly expressed in suture mesenchyme, particularly adjacent to the osteogenic fronts. there was distinct cell surface staining of mesenchymal cells, clearly showing the delicate branching of their cytoplasmic extensions, forming an interlacing network throughout the suture space between bone fronts . osteoblasts lining osteogenic fronts and those recently invaginated also had membranous staining although considerably weaker. there was also staining of mesenchymal cells close to the tissue surface in the mid-sutural region . the higher expression in mesenchymal cells correlates with the higher mrna and protein expression in unfused compared to fusing and fused sutures .

discussion
here, we have identified novel genes and attempted to gain a broader understanding of the various molecular pathways controlling suture morphogenesis in humans postnatally by analysing global gene expression differences between unfused sutures and prematurely fusing/fused sutures from patients with craniosynostosis. this is the first study in which microarray analysis has been applied to investigate differential gene expression in fused, fusing, and unfused human sutures. we identified differentially expressed genes in pathways that have been a major focus of study in craniosynostosis, including fgf, tgfβ and egf signalling pathways. in addition, we identified genes from the eph/ephrin pathway that has recently been linked with craniosynostosis  <cit>  and the wnt pathway that is involved osteoblast differentiation  <cit>  and transducing fgfr signals  <cit> . a number of novel genes which may have important roles in suture biology and which have not been previously linked with craniosynostosis have also been identified, specifically rbp <dig>  gpc <dig>  and c1qtnf <dig>  all three are abundantly expressed in unfused sutures and are significantly downregulated in prematurely fused sutures.

a role for retinol binding protein  <dig> in regulating retinoic acid induced osteoblast differentiation
retinol binding protein  <dig>  expression was decreased 37-fold in prematurely fused/fusing sutures compared to unfused sutures by microarray analysis. rbp <dig> is a secretable plasma protein that classically transports retinol from liver stores to tissues where it undergoes catalytic conversion into retinoic acid   <cit> . extrahepatic rbp <dig> expression occurs in adipose, kidney, cartilage, and brain tissue and during embryonic development of the orofacial region  <cit> . it has been speculated that tissue-specific expression of rbp <dig> is linked to the binding of retinol from plasma in the immediate vicinity of, and for specific use by, its tissue of origin  <cit> . our finding of rbp <dig> in osteocytes on the ectocranial surface of bone directly overlying the suture mesenchyme and by cells lining the osteogenic fronts, and its dramatic downregulation in suture fusion now implicates a role for it in suture morphogenesis and craniosynostosis. at teratogenic levels, the metabolite of retinol, ra, causes craniosynostosis and other developmental anomalies  <cit> . at physiologic levels, however, ra represses growth of preosteoblastic cells and enhances the expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteopontin, collagen type i and the osteoblast specific transcription factor runx <dig>  <cit> . ra also stimulates bmp <dig> expression and cooperates to induce osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, primary rat calvarial osteoblasts treated with ra have increased osteopontin expression and switch from predominately expressing fgfr <dig> to fgfr <dig>  representing a switch from active proliferation to osteoblast differentiation  <cit> . at physiologic levels, a function of this metabolite of retinol is therefore to suppress preosteoblastic proliferation and activate differentiation. this role of ra correlates with the localisation, reported here, of rbp <dig>  the specific transporter of its precursor, in cells lining the ectocranial surface and the osteogenic fronts of unfused sutures and in those recently invaginated into the osteoid. rbp <dig> may therefore represent a primary regulator of osteogenesis in calvarial sutures by mediating the availability of retinol and its subsequent conversion to ra. in support of this, rbp <dig> knockout mice develop cranial malformations  <cit> . taken together with our data on rbp <dig> expression during suture fusion and epidemiological evidence linking excess ra with craniosynostosis and other developmental anomalies  <cit>  we speculate that perturbations in the rbp4-retinol-ra axis may contribute to the occurrence of craniosynostosis.

a role for glypican  <dig> in maintaining suture patency
glypican  <dig>  is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan which binds to the extracellular surface of cells via a gpi  anchor and is thought to facilitate interaction between various ligands and receptors. loss-of-function mutations in gpc <dig> cause simpson-golabi behmel syndrome , an overgrowth syndrome with multiple skeletal abnormalities  that is associated with increased cell proliferation  <cit> . our study shows that gpc <dig> expression is decreased 7-fold in prematurely fused/fusing sutures. gpc <dig> interacts with fgf <dig>  wnt5a, and bmp- <dig> and - <dig> which are ligands of fgf receptors, wnt receptors , and bmp receptors, respectively  <cit> , all of which have been variously implicated in regulating osteoblast function. molecular studies show that loss of gpc <dig> enhances the limb patterning defect of bmp <dig> heterozygous mice  <cit>  and that gpc <dig> can bind fgf <dig> and suppress fgf2-induced cell proliferation  <cit> . gpc <dig> is also able to regulate the wnt signalling pathway. gpc <dig> knockout mice exhibit an inhibition of the non-canonical wnt/jnk signalling pathway, and activation of the canonical wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway  <cit> . canonical wnt/β-catenin signalling promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone accrual and inhibits osteoblast apoptosis . we speculate that gpc <dig> controls cell growth within suture mesenchyme by regulating the bioavailability of fgfs, bmps, and wnts and might therefore acts as a gate-keeper of cell responsiveness in the suture.

a role for c1qtnf <dig> in suture morphogenesis
c1qtnf <dig> , also known as ctrp3/cartducin, and cors <dig>  is a growth factor that hitherto had not been linked to suture morphogenesis. our microarray study showed that c1qtnf <dig> expression is decreased 20-fold in prematurely fused/fusing sutures and qrt-pcr analysis determined that it is the short isoform of c1qtnf <dig> that is differentially expressed . c1qtnf <dig> regulates proliferation of chondrocytes and their progenitor cells during both postnatal and embryonic development and has been shown to be up-regulated during bmp <dig> and insulin induction of chondrocyte differentiation  <cit> . c1qtnf <dig> has also been identified as promoting proliferation and migration of mouse endothelial mss <dig> cells  <cit> . with the discovery of c1qtnf <dig> expression in unfused and fusing tissue of all sutures , we predict a novel role for this growth factor in the regulation of osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation at the osteogenic fronts. given our finding of cartilage-specific markers associated with posterior skull sutures we speculate that c1qtnf <dig> might also be involved in chondrogenesis in addition to osteogenesis in these sutures.

the identification of cartilage in posterior sutures
of particular interest was the identification in our microarray experiment of increased expression of genes coding for cartilage-specific collagens types ii and x in the two unfused lambdoid and the unfused sagittal sutures from the posterior of the skull. the involvement of cartilage in unfused lambdoid sutures was confirmed histologically through the observation within the region of the osteogenic fronts of a cartilaginous matrix which protruded into the suture mesenchyme and adjacent calcified bone matrix . in addition, confocal microscopy localised collagen type x to chondrocytes in the cartilage matrix and in osteoclasts adjacent to cartilage . identification of what is termed 'secondary cartilage' has been previously noted in several human calvarial sutures, with a high incidence in normal lambdoid sutures  <cit> . it has been proposed that this secondary cartilage may develop in response to the higher mechanical forces applied to the posterior region of the skull during growth as it provides a matrix more tolerant to compression  <cit> . cartilage has also been observed in rodent sutures where a cartilaginous plate underlies the lambdoid suture, possibly forming a supportive structure on which intramembranous ossification occurs  <cit> . recently, cartilage and chondrocytic markers have also been identified in sagittal sutures of transgenic mice generated with the apert syndrome fgfr <dig> s252w mutation  <cit> . the cartilage was located at the junction of the parietal and interparietal bones which corresponds to the region from which the sutures we identified as expressing cartilage-specific genes were isolated. importantly, we demonstrated that cartilage is present within the osteogenic fronts, rather than underlying the sutures suggesting a functional rather than supportive role. recently, sox <dig>  a regulator of chondrogenesis, has been shown to be upregulated during the initiation of posterior frontal suture closure in mice, along with the expression of collagen types ii and x, followed by collagen type i and osteocalcin expression  <cit> . a role for endochondral ossification was therefore proposed to control fusion of this suture. additionally, collagen types ii and aggrecan have been detected in preosteogenic-condensing mesenchyme and the osteogenic fronts of developing embryonic chick heads  <cit> . it was proposed that, in chickens, normal intramembranous ossification includes a transient chondrogenic phase. the identification, in our study, of cartilage in lambdoid suture mesenchyme also suggests that chondrogenesis plays a role in human suture morphogenesis, particularly in the posterior skull.

distinctive tissue-type specific gene expression differences
the analysis of gene expression in the different suture-types indicated that gene expression profiles of unfused metopic sutures were more highly correlated with the expression exhibited by fused sutures from other suture sites; specifically they showed a significantly lower expression of those genes increased in other unfused sutures . this unique expression profile may help explain the earlier occurrence of metopic suture fusion during development. unfused coronal and unfused lambdoid sutures also showed very similar expression profiles. both these sutures are generally formed by overlapping calvarial bone fronts, in comparison to the blunt-end sutures which form the sagittal and metopic sutures  <cit> . these sutures are also similar in that they are a meeting of bones of two different developmental origins  while the sagittal and metopic sutures are the meeting point of bones of one origin, either mesoderm or neural crest, respectively.

transcription factors are key controllers of the signalling cascades activated during development. of those transcription factors differentially expressed between fused and unfused suture tissue a majority also showed significant expression differences between suture types. unfused sagittal sutures had a higher expression of homeobox genes shox <dig> and pax <dig> which potentially drive osteoblast differentiation and generally had increased expression in fused sutures. the unfused sagittal sutures also showed a lower expression of msx <dig>  six <dig>  pitx <dig>  bhlh <dig>  and hlf that were generally increased in other unfused sutures compared to fused sutures. given the higher frequency of non-syndromic craniosynostosis in the sagittal suture we speculate that a lower expression of transcription factors associated with unfused sutures, and a higher expression of those associated with fused sutures, might leave this suture more vulnerable to premature closure. both unfused sagittal and unfused coronal sutures had significantly higher expression of members of the fos  and jun  oncogene families compared to unfused lambdoid sutures, particularly for coronal sutures . through homo- and hetero-dimerisation, these proteins form the ap- <dig> transcription complex. increased jun and fos expression occurs in prematurely fused mouse sutures induced by the application of fgf2-soaked beads  <cit> . it was suggested that fgf signalling increases expression of the ap- <dig> complex which then induces expression of osteopontin and osteoblast differentiation, resulting in premature suture closure. it is also known that the coronal and sagittal sutures are those most frequently affected in fgfr syndromic craniosynostoses. we therefore suggest that the higher expression of ap- <dig> transcription factor components in coronal and sagittal sutures makes them more responsive to the increased or inappropriate fgf signalling caused by gain-of-function fgfr mutations. however, it was also observed that unfused sagittal sutures had decreased expression of fgfr <dig> compared to the coronal suture. this may explain why mutations in these genes most commonly affect the coronal suture rather than the sagittal suture.

another important finding from our microarray analysis was that there was limited difference in whole genome expression between non-syndromic and syndromic patient samples. this was verified by qrt-pcr using  <dig> samples from  <dig> syndromic and  <dig> non-syndromic patients, analysing  <dig> genes differentially expressed between unfused and fused sutures. we note, however, that these genes were identified as being significantly differentially expressed during premature fusion by using tissue groups which contained samples from patients with different aetiologies. thus, we specifically identified genes which were not specific to one aetiology. if these two groups of samples were analysed independently, it is likely that there may be a small proportion of genes which are differentially expressed between samples from patients with different aetiologies and these genes will be directly related to the mutation of initiation. however, in this study we were not so interested in these aetiology specific indicators, but rather the general mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis. significantly, the results from our microarray hierarchical analysis study indicate that the genes involved in the pathogenesis of different types of craniosynostosis are more similar than may previously have been thought.

CONCLUSIONS
through the analysis of human suture material we have identified a large number of novel differentially expressed genes, three of which, rbp <dig>  gpc <dig> and c1qtnf <dig>  we believe may have significant regulatory roles in the control of both suture patency and growth. furthermore, we have identified significant gene expression differences between human sutures from different cranial sites and identified the involvement of cartilage in posterior calvarial sutures, particularly the lambdoid suture. these data open up new avenues of investigation in respect to the molecular mechanisms underlying the different responses of calvarial sutures to mutations causing craniosynostosis. this information is vital for the development of therapeutic agents to control skull growth in children with sutural defects, as well as providing clinicians with a better understanding of the developmental mechanisms operating in different sutures.
