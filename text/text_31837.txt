BACKGROUND
histological classification of biopsied breast tissue plays a key role in mammary cancer detection and in determining patient treatment. current methods rely on gross signatures of cellular and tissue organization including tubular formation, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity. to aid the early detection and diagnosis of mammary tumors, quantitative techniques are highly needed that could not only help automate the classification process but also provide subcellular information that could be used to reveal new subclasses of tumor within each pathological grade.

increasing evidence has shown that chromatin-associated proteins are important in directing nuclear functions involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . using tissue models, formed by culturing human mammary epithelial cells  from the hmt- <dig> cancer progression series in matrigel™ , earlier studies showed that the distribution of nuclear mitotic apparatus  protein was remarkably different in non-neoplastic cells that were proliferating compared to those that had completed acinar morphogenesis by forming polarized glandular tissue structures  <cit> . for instance, during the 10-day in vitro morphogenesis process, numa staining was reported as diffusely distributed within the nuclei of proliferating cells, and had aggregated into foci of increasing size as cells arrested proliferation and completed acinar morphogenesis  <cit> .

based on these findings, knowles et al then developed an image-based technique, called local bright feature  analysis  <cit> . the technique uses fluorescence images of total dna and specifically stained nuclear proteins and calculates the radial distribution of the density of bright immunostained features as a function of the distance from the perimeter of the nucleus to its center. the lbf analysis was used to quantify the distribution of fluorescently stained numa from confocal images of non-neoplastic  and malignant  hmt- <dig> hmecs, cultured in 3d for up to  <dig> days  <cit> . by averaging the lbf distributions over populations of cells with the same phenotype, the study showed that the lbf analysis reproducibly captured changes in numa distribution along the morphogenic process in non-neoplastic s <dig> cells. it also revealed that the numa distribution in malignant t4- <dig> cells was diffuse and independent of the number of days the cells were in culture  <cit> .

here we report a cluster analysis approach, based on the distribution of nuclear proteins, that robustly calculates the statistical significance between cell phenotypes, which are defined by the behavior of the cells in 3d culture. the method first groups lbf distributions into clusters using multiple traditional clustering methods. the results are then combined by a probabilistic ensemble approach into a set of consensus clusters that can be used to reliably define all possible lbf distributions that exist within a data set. this then allows cluster histograms to be computed which show how the lbf distributions in individual cells from a group are distributed over the consensus clusters. these cluster histograms represent a new way of linking the phenotype of groups of phenotypically similar cells, defined by their behavior in 3d culture, with their lbf distributions, quantified microscopically. further, by grouping the lbf cluster histograms in multiple ways, the method is then able to build a phenotype tree and to calculate the statistical significance between each grouping. each level of the tree corresponds to a different phenotype division of the cells and provides a way to predict which of the cell phenotypes, or grouping of cell phenotypes are significantly different from each other. these methods were then applied to the lbf distributions of numa in s <dig> and t4- <dig> cells, previously reported in knowles et al  <cit> . the resulting cluster histograms clearly showed that the distribution of numa changes during the morphogenic process as non-neoplastic s <dig> cells growth arrest and differentiate. the resulting phenotype tree showed that non-neoplastic s <dig> cells could be distinguished from malignant t4- <dig> cells with  <dig> % accuracy; that proliferating s <dig> cells could be distinguished from differentiated s <dig> cells with  <dig> % accuracy; and clearly indicated that numa distribution was unchanged in the various phenotypes of malignant t4- <dig> cells.

RESULTS
dataset
as described in  <cit> , non-neoplastic hmt- <dig> s <dig> cells were cultured in 3d in the presence of matrigel™ for up to  <dig> days to induce acinar morphogenesis. malignant hmt- <dig> t4- <dig> cells were cultured under similar conditions for a maximum of  <dig> days to avoid the overgrowth of tumor nodules. dna was stained with dapi to visualize the limits of the nuclear volume and numa proteins were labeled with texas red. three-dimensional images were acquired using a zeiss  <dig> confocal laser-scanning microscope with planapochromatic 63×,  <dig>  numerical aperture lens. the resulting voxel dimensions of the 3d images were  <dig>  ×  <dig>  μm in the plane of the slide and  <dig>  μm along the optical direction.

we used three image datasets to test our phenotype clustering approach. the first dataset contains  <dig> non-neoplastic s <dig> cells taken from  <dig> confocal images. images 1– <dig>  26– <dig>  46– <dig>  and 62– <dig> are s <dig> cells cultured for  <dig> days,  <dig> days,  <dig> days, and  <dig> days respectively. the second dataset contains  <dig> malignant t4- <dig> cells taken from  <dig> images. images 1– <dig>  15– <dig>  27– <dig>  and 37– <dig> are t4- <dig> cells cultured in  <dig> days,  <dig> days,  <dig> days, and  <dig> days respectively. the third dependent dataset contains both malignant t4- <dig> and non-neoplastic s <dig> cells taken from the direct combination of all the  <dig> images. the time points were selected to span the growth progression of the non-neoplastic cultured cells. optical sections from 3d images of individual nuclei, showing representative numa staining for each of the phenotypes, are displayed in the methods section.

clustering lbf distributions using traditional approaches
using an automated image analysis method developed earlier  <cit> , we extracted the local bright staining features of numa protein and quantified their radial distribution in each nucleus in all the  <dig> s <dig> and t <dig> images. in this way, we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> lbf distributions for s <dig> and t <dig> cells respectively. each distribution is represented by the normalized density of bright numa protein feature as a function of the normalized distance from the perimeter of the nucleus to its center .

using traditional approaches of fuzzy c-means clustering, gaussian mixture model clustering , k-means, hierarchical clustering , and spectral clustering  <cit> , we divided the dataset into a number of clusters according to the similarities of their lbf distributions. figure  <dig> shows the results for each of these traditional approaches when the dataset of  <dig> non-neoplastic s <dig> cells is divided into  <dig> clusters. the final result, as we show below, is not dependent on the number of clusters. each cluster is represented by the centroid  and standard deviation  of the lbf distributions in the cluster. clearly, the different methods cluster the data in different ways.

finding consensus lbf clusters using probabilistic ensemble clustering
as shown in table  <dig>  different clustering methods may generate different results for the same dataset and the agreement between them can be low. this is because each clustering method assumes certain data distributions and cluster characteristics. for instance, the gaussian mixture model assumes clusters satisfy the gaussian distribution. k-means works well for clusters of convex shapes. thus, some algorithms might perform well for specific datasets and not for others. in general, no single clustering method can successfully handle different types of cluster structure. in addition, even different initializations and parameter settings of the same method, for instance, k-means and gaussian mixture model, may generate different clustering results. as a result, selecting an optimal clustering method is non-trivial or even impossible in many cases. a reasonable way to get a reliable partition of a dataset is to derive a consensus from multiple clustering results, the assumption being that the judgment made by a committee is more robust and unbiased than those made by individuals. this idea, called ensemble clustering, has been investigated in some literatures and several major benefits have been identified  <cit> . first, ensemble-clustering can improve the robustness of clustering. the clusters generated tend to be less sensitive to noise, outliers, initialization, or sampling variations compared to individual clustering methods. second, ensemble clustering does not need a priori information about the number of clusters, but can effectively determine the most probable number of clusters. third, ensemble clustering can detect outliers. this ability is closely associated with the ability of determining the number of clusters.

several different ensemble-clustering methods have become available. in  <cit> , a voting algorithm based on hierarchical clustering of the co-association matrix  is used to derive the consensus clusters. in  <cit> , strehl and ghosh developed an evidence accumulation and a hypergraph representation ensemble clustering method. in  <cit> , topchy et al proposed a mutual-information-based method. in  <cit> , fischer and buhmann developed a bootstrap algorithm by first relabeling the data in each clustering result to find the correspondence and then using a voting scheme to find consensus.

in this work, we used a probabilistic ensemble approach based on bayesian latent variable induction  <cit>  . assuming that the clustering results generated by individual methods, i.e., gaussian mixture model, fuzzy c-means, k-means, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering, are independent of each other, the bayesian latent variable induction method is able to obtain the statistically optimal combination of individual clustering results as shown by chickering and heckerman in  <cit> . a similar probabilistic ensemble approach has also been adopted by topchy in  <cit>  where accurate consensus was obtained from unreliable individual clustering results.

using the probabilistic ensemble clustering approach , we derived the statistically optimal consensus from different data partition results generated by the five traditional clustering methods mentioned above. figure  <dig> shows the result of combining the clusters generated by the five traditional approaches as shown in figure  <dig> using the probabilistic ensemble approach. the number of clusters,  <dig>  is automatically determined as a result of finding the consensus.

computing cluster histograms
with clusters reliably determined, we then calculated the number of lbf distributions falling into each cluster for each of the  <dig> populations of cells, i.e., non-neoplastic s <dig> cells cultured for  <dig> days,  <dig> days,  <dig> days, and  <dig> days, as well as malignant t4- <dig> cells cultured for  <dig> days,  <dig> days,  <dig> days, and  <dig> days. by doing so, we obtained a cluster histogram for each of the  <dig> populations of cells. figure 3a shows the  <dig> clusters automatically determined by combining the clustering results of gaussian mixture model, fuzzy c-means, hierarchical clustering, k-means, and spectral clustering using the probabilistic ensemble clustering for the dataset containing  <dig> non-neoplastic s <dig> cells and  <dig> malignant t4- <dig> cells. the number of the clusters predefined for these baseline methods is  <dig> . in fact, the cluster histograms and the phenotype trees built in later step are insensitive to the number of clusters predefined for traditional clustering methods as will be shown in the methods section. the  <dig> clusters in figure 3a are ordered from the left to the right and the top to the bottom according to their peak locations. the first  <dig> clusters are approximately flat. in the 9th to the 20th clusters the peak location shifts from the left to the right. figure 3b shows the cluster histograms for the  <dig> populations of cells. for s <dig> cells, the cluster histograms  are remarkably different between the early stage  and the completion of acinar morphogenesis . the peak of the histogram gradually shifts from the left to the right as the number of days in culture increases, indicating a gradual modification during the 12-day in vitro morphogenesis process. this is consistent with the fact that numa staining is diffusely distributed within the nuclei of proliferating cells, but aggregates into foci of increasing size as cells arrest proliferation and complete acinar morphogenesis. therefore, the cluster histograms statistically reflect the phenotype of non-neoplastic s <dig> cells. moreover, the peak of the histogram profile does not change significantly for malignant t4- <dig> cells cultured for different numbers of days . this is also consistent with the fact that numa staining is diffusely distributed within t4- <dig> nuclei despite the number of days in culture. interestingly, the cluster histograms of malignant t4- <dig> cells differ significantly from those of non-neoplastic s <dig> cells. the consistency of cluster histograms and cell types indicates that it is meaningful to develop a method to predict cell phenotypes and their sub-categories based on cluster histograms.

constructing phenotype trees
using the approach introduced in the methods section, we have constructed phenotype trees to show how the phenotypes, defined by the behavior of the cells in 3d culture, can be hierarchically grouped and the statistical significance of each grouping calculated. figure 4a shows the phenotype tree built for non-neoplastic s <dig> cells. at the first level in this figure, the four phenotypes of s <dig> cells were divided into two groups. of the multiple ways to create two groups from four phenotypes, our method found that having s <dig> cells at day  <dig> and day  <dig> in one group and s <dig> cells at day  <dig> and day  <dig> in the other resulted in the highest confidence value, of  <dig>  . in the second level of the tree, our method divided s <dig> cells into three phenotype groups. the results showed that having s <dig> cells at day  <dig> and day  <dig> as one group, s <dig> cells at day  <dig> as the second group, and s <dig> cells at day  <dig> as the third provided the highest confidence value of  <dig> . this was lower than the confidence of dividing s <dig> cells into two groups. finally, the method divided s <dig> cells into four groups which resulted in a confidence value of  <dig>  . this phenotype tree indicates we can distinguish s <dig> cells at day  <dig> and  <dig> from those cultured at day  <dig> and  <dig> days with high confidence.

using the same approach, we constructed the phenotype trees for malignant t4- <dig> cells and for the combination of s <dig> and t4- <dig> cells, as shown in figure 4b and figure 4c respectively. figure 4b shows that we can distinguish t4- <dig> cells cultured at day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig> from those cultured at day  <dig> in relatively high confidence . however, if we want to distinguish t4- <dig> cells cultured for different numbers of days, the confidence drops to  <dig> . figure 4c shows that we can distinguish s <dig> and t4- <dig> cells with very high confidence . however, the confidence drops as level increases. the certainty in distinguishing all the  <dig> phenotypes drops to  <dig>  at the highest level of the tree. in general, the phenotype trees provide us a way to evaluate how the phenotypes, defined by the behavior of the cells in 3d culture, can be hierarchically grouped and the statistical significance between each grouping calculated.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a cluster analysis approach that can robustly link any given set of multivariate features measured on a per cell basis to the phenotype of the cells as defined by their macroscopic biology. the technique uses a probabilistic ensemble approach to group the measured multivariate features into a set of consensus clusters. this method provides a novel way of linking the phenotypes of groups of cells to cluster histograms that describe the distribution of the measured features across the consensus clusters. then, by forming various groupings of the cluster histograms, the technique permits the formation of a phenotype tree and calculations of the statistical significance between each of the groups. if two groups of cells are found to be significantly different, one can conclude that the features measured in the cells can distinguish the groups that are indeed different. if the two groups are not significantly different, one can only conclude that the measured feature does not change between these groups. it does not imply that that the groups are necessarily identical.

the phenotype tree is a hierarchical representation of the possible grouping of the defined cell phenotypes. as such, a node in the tree at level l can be spitted into at most two nodes at level l+ <dig>  however, the method used in building the tree does not prevent inconsistent group divisions between level l and l+ <dig>  thus a node at level l+ <dig> can be a combination of two partial nodes at level l, as shown in figure  <dig>  as a result, the hierarchical structure cannot be represented as a tree. to solve the problem, we can add a consistency constrain to make the phenotype groups, between different tree levels, coherent. alternatively, we can use directed acyclic graphs  to represent the hierarchical structure of cell phenotype without adding any consistency constrain.

we have shown how the cluster analysis technique can be applied to the radial lbf distributions of a chromatin-associated protein, numa  <cit> , measured on a per cell basis from non-neoplastic s <dig> and malignant t4- <dig> hmecs, cultured in a 3d environment for up to  <dig> days. the results showed, that for this measured feature, the method can distinguish the non-neoplastic s <dig> cells and malignant t4- <dig> cells with  <dig> % accuracy, and proliferating s <dig> cells from s <dig> cells differentiated into acinar structures with  <dig> % accuracy. the phenotype tree also shows that the method only distinguishes the four phenotypes of s <dig> cells with  <dig> % accuracy. however, when the two phenotypes s1-day  <dig> and s1-day  <dig> are considered as one group, the ability to distinguish that group from s1-day  <dig> and s1-day  <dig> jumps to  <dig> %. this result demonstrates the power of the phenotype tree, which in this case shows that the distribution of numa changes moderately between the phenotypes s1-day <dig> and s1-day  <dig>  markedly between the phenotypes s1-day  <dig> and s1-day  <dig> but then does not changed significantly in s <dig> cells at  <dig> days compared to  <dig> days in culture. these results correlate with the behavior of cultured s <dig> cells and clearly show that the reorganization of numa that occurs during the morphogenic process of these cells is almost complete at  <dig> days of culture. in other words, s1-day  <dig> and s1-day  <dig> are not significantly different phenotypes, based on numa distribution. these results are echoed by the cluster histograms for the s <dig> cells. clearly marked differences are seen between cluster histograms of the phenotypes s1-day  <dig> and s1-day  <dig> and not between the phenotypes s1-day  <dig> and s1-day  <dig>  further, the method only distinguishes the four phenotypes of t4- <dig> cells with  <dig> % accuracy. this result also correlates with the behavior of these malignant cells that continue to proliferate throughout the  <dig> day culture period. this result simply demonstrates that based on numa distribution, the phenotypes t4-2-day  <dig>  t4-2-day  <dig>  t4-2-day  <dig> and t4-2-day  <dig> are not significantly different. it does not rule out the possibility that introducing other measured features could reveal differences between such phenotypes.

collectively our data demonstrate the quantitative ability of clustering-based analysis to link microscopically measurable features with the behavior of the cells. the methods described demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish populations of cells based on the nuclear organization of a chromatin-associated protein, numa. this work paves the way for our longer term goal of producing a method capable of turning high resolution fluorescence images of human mammary epithelial tissue into tissue-maps that report the probable non-neoplastic, premalignant and malignant phenotype at cellular resolution.
