BACKGROUND
the ability of plants to defend against insect feeding has long been a research focus to understand adaptation and co-evolution  <cit> . sometimes referred to as a classic evolutionary arms race, these naturally evolved systems are often exploited in crop plants that offer resistance to insect pests as a way to prevent damage and protect yield, i.e. host plant resistance   <cit> . many host-plant resistant cultivars target aphids because they are arguably the most insidious pests of agronomic and horticultural crops worldwide  <cit> . yet several aphid species have been able to overcome this resistance in the form of virulent biotypes, which threatens the utility and sustainability of aphid resistant varieties  <cit> . research on the molecular interactions between aphids and their host plants will allow comparative approaches to both expand our understanding of co-evolution as well as improve the durability of plant resistance.

induced plant defenses usually involve the production of plant secondary metabolites  that are toxic to insects. in turn, most insects respond to psms by inducing an array of stress response proteins including enzymes for metabolic excretion  <cit> . the metabolic excretion of psms and other xenobiotics by insects tends to occur in three phases . in phase i, the biological activity of the specific metabolite is reduced, with cytochrome p450s acting as principal enzymes  <cit> . in phase ii, the by-products of phase i are conjugated with hydrophilic substances to increase water-solubility which facilitates their excretion  <cit> . phase ii enzymes include glutathione s-transferases , carboxylesterases , and udp-glucuronlytransferases . finally, in phase iii, conjugated compounds are exported out of the cell by employing atp-binding cassette  and other transmembrane transporters  <cit> .

in addition to inducing xenobiotic metabolism genes, insect stress and defense responses can also involve important proteins such as heat-shock proteins, proteases , and multicopper oxidases   <cit> . transcriptional activity of insect xenobiotic stress response machinery is regulated by transcription factors   <cit> . previous evidence, though limited, suggests that aphids utilize diverse mechanisms, including detoxification and other defense pathways, to cope with psms and host-plant resistance  <cit> .

another important factor in aphid-plant interactions are effectors . primarily, effectors are proteins or small molecules present in aphid saliva which modify the structure and function of a plant cell and can ultimately promote insect virulence and survival and/or trigger plant defense response  <cit> . although numerous candidate effector genes from various aphid species have been identified either at the transcriptomic or proteomic level, their expression dynamics during compatible  and incompatible  interactions remain largely unexplored.

the soybean aphid, aphis glycines, is a major pest of soybean  in both its native asia, as well as in north america where it is invasive  <cit> . a. glycines can cause up to 58% yield loss in soybean and is estimated to have an annual economic loss of $ <dig> - <dig>  billion on soybean production in north-america  <cit> . additionally, the use of insecticides to manage a. glycines has led to a dramatic rise in input cost for soybean production  <cit> .

to minimize damage by a. glycines, host plant resistance has been a significant research focus as it can be effective, economical, and environmentally safe  <cit> . to date,  <dig> major soybean genes  and  <dig> provisional genes  conferring resistance to a. glycines have been identified . among these, rag <dig>  known to exhibit both antibiosis  and antixenosis  has been commercialized since  <dig>  <cit> . however, prior to the commercial release of resistant varieties, virulent biotypes of a. glycines that can survive on hpr soybean had already been discovered. for a. glycines,  <dig> biotypes  are known so far, each with varying abilities to survive and reproduce on individual or pyramided rag possessing soybean . thus, sustainable management of a. glycines using hpr remains a considerable challenge  <cit> .

a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions between soybean and a. glycines, at both the plant and insect level, can provide insights into the hpr mechanism and potential routes of virulence adaptation. previous work has focused on the molecular responses of soybean to attack by a. glycines <cit> , but corresponding studies on a. glycines are lacking. here, we compared the molecular response of a. glycines when fed resistant  or susceptible soybean using rna-sequencing  and determined whether the response was consistent with antibiosis or antixenosis. previous electrical penetration graphs of a. glycines feeding behavior and soybean transcriptomic studies revealed that rag1-mediated resistance is effective within the first few hours of infestation  <cit> . a. glycines stylets reach sieve elements of susceptible and resistant plants in 6 h and 9 h, respectively  <cit> , with phloem intake commencing afterwards. on resistant plants, a. glycines can be seen dispersing 16-24 h after infestation, most likely due to stress of plant toxins and/or non-preference. effects of rag <dig> on a. glycines culminate during 24-36 h after infestation when mortality ensues, either due to psms, starvation, or both. therefore, in order to have a comprehensive understanding of effects of rag <dig> resistance and to avoid capturing expression signatures occurring due to potential starvation stress, we focused on an early time point  in this interaction. using rna-seq, we identified many a. glycines genes and gene families which are at molecular interface of its interaction with soybean and may play a critical role in virulence adaptation. owing to high-throughput sequencing strategy, we also significantly enriched the existing transcriptomic resources for a. glycines, a non-model but important invasive aphid species, which will provide a foundation for future molecular studies in this insect.

RESULTS
de novoassembly and annotation
rna-seq for a. glycines yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> high quality, 76-bases paired-end reads. we pooled rna-seq reads with a previous transcriptome  to improve coverage and quality of the assembly. using the combined dataset, de novo assembly of a. glycines produced  <dig>  high quality transcripts, totaling  <dig> , <dig> bases. the length of the transcripts varied from 150- <dig>  nucleotides with an average of  <dig> nucleotides . the assembly’s n <dig> equaled  <dig>  , which is relatively high for a non-model organism.figure  <dig>

to determine the completeness of a. glycines transcriptome assembly, each transcript was compared to its putative ortholog in acyrthosiphon pisum, bombyx mori, drosophila melanogaster, nasonia vitripennis, rhodnius prolixus, and tribolium casteneum. nearly, 50% of a. glycines transcripts  had an ortholog hit ratio  > <dig>  . considering that an ohr value of  <dig> indicates a poor assembly and a value of  <dig> indicates a fully assembled transcriptome  <cit> , our assembly for a. glycines seems to be fairly comprehensive.

nearly 30%  of the a. glycines transcripts had one or more hits to protein sequences in the refseq_protein database at genbank . the majority of the top blast hits for a. glycines transcripts were to insects , whereas a small proportion showed top hits to bacteria, non-arthropod animals, plants, fungi and viruses . as expected,  <dig> %  of top hits for a. glycines transcripts were to a. pisum, which has a well characterized genome  <cit> . a. glycines transcripts having no match may represent genes either with a novel function or whose function has not yet been designated. interestingly, an interproscan search revealed hits to protein signature domains for  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  transcripts without a match to the ref_seq protein database , suggesting that many have homologs in other species that were undetected. blastn searches with the unmatched a. glycines dataset  revealed hits for  <dig>  transcripts, with top hits to a. pisum  and aphis craccivora . nonetheless, a relatively high percentage of transcripts with ‘no match’ obtained in our study is not surprising as similar values are recorded for transcriptomes of other non-model insects .

comparative genomics
using pairwise blastx searches to protein databases for four model insects, significant matches for a. glycines transcripts  were obtained. a blastx search to the a. pisum database showed matches for highest number of a. glycines transcripts  . a majority of a. glycines transcripts  had matches to all the searched databases. however, there were a substantial number of transcripts which uniquely matched to a. pisum , whereas only a few uniquely matched to r. prolixus , t. casteneum , and d. melanogaster  databases.

functional annotation
using blast2go, a total of  <dig>  a. glycines transcripts were annotated. observed gene ontology  terms for each domain  were widely distributed into different categories. a comparison of percent mappings to each go category between a. glycines and a. pisum revealed nearly identical distributions for both aphid species . the majority of transcripts assigned to the ‘biological process’ domain were involved in cellular, regulatory, developmental, and reproductive activities, while the largest part of transcripts under ‘molecular function’ domain were predicted to have catalytic, binding and transporter functions. through kegg-based pathway analysis, a. glycines transcripts were assigned to one or more of  <dig> total pathways . the majority of transcripts were assigned to pathways for metabolism of nitrogenous compounds  and sugars . interestingly, a total of  <dig> transcripts were assigned to  <dig> pathways for xenobiotic degradation and metabolism. among them, transcripts encoding enzymes involved in metabolism  were the most abundant.

we obtained nearly  <dig> and  <dig> million rna-seq reads for a. glycines fed with resistant  and susceptible soybean, respectively . for expression measurements, 77-87% of total reads mapped to reference database genes, with nearly all reads mapping uniquely. the read depth for reference database genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  reads per gene. statistical analysis revealed  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  . the average expression level and read depth of all differentially expressed genes are provided in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> and  <dig> up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, were found in a. glycines fed with rag <dig> compared to those fed with the susceptible plant . we chose  <dig> genes that spanned the range of differential expression and included several functional categories  to validate our statistical analysis with rna-seq. this comparison concurred with the expression pattern  and supported the accuracy and reliability of rna-seq in differential gene expression analysis . the go enrichment analysis  revealed  <dig> enriched ‘molecular function’ categories each among the up- and down-regulated genes , which are detailed in following sections.table  <dig>

suppression of putative salivary effector gene expression
as effectors play a central role in the molecular interaction between aphids and their host plants  <cit> , we focused on genes that could encode for salivary effector proteins. currently, there is little knowledge regarding a. glycines effectors; however using a. pisum effectors as queries  we found significant hits to our transcriptome, totaling  <dig> putative effectors . however, only  <dig> putative effector transcripts were differentially expressed in a. glycines fed with rag <dig> plant . these  <dig> putative effectors showed 90-98% amino acid similarity to a. pisum effectors , and all were predicted to contain a secretion signal peptide at the n-terminal . our semi-quantitative pcr results confirmed effector expression in a. glycines salivary glands  as has been observed for their homologs in other aphids . interestingly, genes for these six effectors were down-regulated in a. glycines on rag1-soybean compared to those feeding on susceptible plants; with reduction in transcript levels ranging between  <dig> - <dig>  fold  .table  <dig>

differential gene expression in starved a. glycines
rag <dig> leads to both antibiotic and antixenotic responses in a. glycines <cit> , and the response seen in our study may also be related to starvation from the antixenotic response . due to the lack of a standardized and consistent artificial feeding  assay, we used starved aphids as a proxy to examine the molecular response that might be expected with antixenosis-induced starvation. using qrt-pcr, we compared gene expression of the same  <dig> genes that encompassed a range of expression levels  in aphids starved for 12 hr. we observed an overall pattern of reduced gene expression in starved aphids, and, in  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, the decrease was significant and expression was substantially less than what was observed when a. glycines was fed either rag <dig> or susceptible soybean . for example, expression of disulphide isomerase like gene  was reduced by ~ <dig>  fold after starvation, but only ~ <dig>  fold after feeding on rag1-soybean. in addition, p450s showed decreased expression in starved aphids, which would be expected in the absence of psms or other stress related to plant resistance.figure  <dig>

discussion
in plant-aphid interactions, initial molecular recognition and signaling events are rapid and transient  <cit> . to identify the key genes involved, it is vital to focus on early time points, especially in an incompatible interaction   <cit> . our gene expression data was consistent with a rapid response by rag1-soybean upon infestation with a. glycines <cit> . expression of genes typically involved in xenobiotic  metabolism  increased, whereas a few effectors showed decreased expression. these gene expression patterns were not similar to what was observed in starved aphids . overall, our results indicated an active, rapid, and specific molecular xenobiotic stress response in a. glycines when fed resistant soybean and are consistent with earlier studies showing rapid responses in aphid-infested soybean and the presence of, yet unidentified, psms.

feeding on resistant rag1-soybean induces a xenobiotic stress response
psms, the defensive chemicals possessing direct toxicity to insect herbivores, are believed to occur as a complex mixture of inducers, substrates and inhibitors of insect xenobiotic response machinery  <cit> . we found that feeding a. glycines on resistant soybean resulted in the up-regulation of genes encoding for p450s, gsts, coe, and abc transporters . this response is consistent with a typical xenobiotic challenge, resulting from the probable ingestion of psms present in rag1-soybean, and supports the ‘antibiosis’ mode of hpr  <cit> . this increase was not due to starvation, as all p450’s were down regulated in starved a. gylcines . the involvement of some of these p450s and abc transporters in other biological functions cannot be ruled out as these occur as large gene families known to perform multiple biological functions.

in rag1-soybean, no specific psm toxic to a. glycines has been reported due to a lack of metabolomics studies. however, a microarray-based study on rag1-soybean responses to a. glycines feeding identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes for secondary metabolism  <cit> . interestingly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were related to the phenylpropanoid pathway  and encoded for homologs of chalcone synthase, isoflavone synthase, and a flavanone 3-hydroxylase-like protein. in plants, the ppp is a rich source of psms for defense against insect herbivores  <cit> . soybean ppp produces psms like flavones, isoflavones, isoflavanones, and anthocyanins which can be potentially toxic to a. glycines <cit> . besides phenylpropanoids, phenolics appear to provide another layer of defense in rag1-soybean, as indicated by the induction of laccase- <dig> genes in a. glycines . insect laccases are copper-containing enzymes which tend to detoxify plant phenolics through oxidation reactions  <cit> .

among  <dig> induced p <dig> genes in a. glycines feeding on rag1-soybean,  <dig> belonged to the cyp <dig> family of cyp <dig> clan . members in this family have previously shown similar responses in other insects, and are specifically involved in metabolism of numerous psms. for example, cyp6b enzymes detoxify psms in papilio polyxenes, p. multicaudatus, and helicoverpa zea <cit> . interestingly, the induction of p <dig> and other xenobiotic metabolism genes revealed in current study occurred in an incompatible interaction . in fact, the induction of xenobiotic response genes by psm exposure is thought to be the first step leading to the eventual detoxification and virulence adaptation because mutations responsible for higher enzymatic potency toward a xenobiotic substrate are more likely to be selected if these occur in inducible genes  rather than in constitutive genes  <cit> . our findings strongly indicate a vital role for p450s in the coevolutionary history and apparent ‘arms race’ between a. glycines and soybean, and future investigation into role of xenobiotic response machinery may reveal adaptation mechanism in virulent biotypes.

suppression of putative salivary effector gene expression
among  <dig> putative a. glycines effectors identified in this study,  <dig> matched to a. pisum effectors with known function . based on homology, these effectors seem capable of performing diverse biological functions at the interface of aphid-plant interactions. further, the down-regulation of  <dig> effectors in a. glycines fed with resistant plants  seems to be specific, as expression of other putative infection-promoting effectors  remain unchanged . the mechanism of suppression after feeding on rag1-soybean is unclear and may likely involve different possibilities. first, micrornas  in rag1-soybean may down-regulate a. glycines effector genes directly. aphid resistant plants show differential expression of many conserved mirna families upon aphid infestation compared to susceptible plants  <cit> . furthermore, aphid tissues contain several plant mirnas which are ingested during feeding on resistant plants  <cit> . the capability of micrornas to perform cross-kingdom regulation  further supports a potential role of mirnas regulating a. glycines gene expression.

second, suppression of effector genes may be a by-product of the rapid induction of the xenobiotic metabolism machinery. initially, to reach sieve element cells, aphid stylets follow an extracellular path surrounded by epidermal, mesodermal and parenchyma cells  <cit> . however, along the way, stylets puncture these cells  and secrete saliva. plants can then recognize aphid infestation and mount immediate defense responses in surface cells, even before stylets reach the sieve element cells. for example, after aphid infestation, vat  and mi- <dig>   based resistance is ubiquitous in various cell types  <cit> . in fact, a broad, ubiquitous resistance expression is a typical feature of nbs-lrr family genes in plants  <cit> . there is a strong evidence that rag <dig>  also predicted to be a member of nbs-lrr family  <cit> , mounts its defense ubiquitously in surface cellular layers  <cit> . since the defense response is so rapid, shutting down salivary effector expression may lead to more efficient xenobiotic metabolism, resulting in a molecular trade-off. this may also explain the difference in magnitude of putative effector expression between aphids on resistant plants and starved aphids. having no access to plants for a longer time period, starved aphids likely initiated an earlier and stronger suppression of gene expression . however, with a lack of a consistent artificial diet assay, it may be difficult to disentangle the effects of starvation.

third, the resistance factors encountered in the sieve elements of rag1-soybean may be responsible for decreased effector expression in a. glycines. this possibility is supported by the observation that aphid stylets stay for only  <dig>  min in sieve elements of rag1-soybean, as opposed to  <dig>  min in susceptible plant  <cit>  which ultimately results in reduced salivation. otherwise, effector secretion is a continuous phenomenon for aphids on susceptible plants  <cit> .

protease and protease-inhibitor gene regulation against rag1defence
as a part of defence against herbivores, plants deploy protease inhibitors which target insect digestive proteases and suppress enzymatic activities  <cit> . to combat this, herbivorous insects exhibit elevated levels of inhibitor-insensitive and/or reduced levels of inhibitor-sensitive proteases  <cit> . the observed differential expression of proteases in a. glycines feeding on the resistant plant  occurred in response to the elevated levels of protease inhibitors in rag1-soybean after aphid infestation  <cit> . however, modified a. glycines protease activity may have undesirable effects as it can be harmful to critical gut structures  <cit> , in addition to the potential damage caused by plant proteinases  <cit> . thus, in order to protect itself from internal and external proteinases, it is likely that a. glycines differentially regulates protease inhibitors, as observed in this study .

CONCLUSIONS
soybean with rag <dig> resistance induced the expression of genes encoding various stress response proteins such as p450s, gst, coe, abc transporter, and hsp in a. glycines. furthermore, feeding on rag1-soybean resulted in the down-regulation of genes for putative effectors that were found in a. glycines salivary glands. the overall response in a. glycines due to rag <dig> feeding resembled that of a characteristic xenobiotic challenge, which supported the ‘antibiosis’ mode of rag <dig> hpr being mediated through toxic psms. the genes identified here will be prime candidates to investigate a. glycines biotype evolution.
