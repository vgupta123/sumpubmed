BACKGROUND
clostridium botulinum is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that causes the severe neuroparalytic illness in humans and animals known as botulism. there are seven serologically distinct types of botulinum neurotoxin -types a, b, c, d, e, f, and g. comparison of  <dig> s rrna sequences  <cit>  showed that c. botulinum strains forms four distinct clusters that correspond to four physiological groups , which supported the historical classification scheme based upon biochemical and biophysical parameters. group i  strains produce one or sometimes two toxins of type a, b or f; group ii  strains produce toxins of type b, e, or f; group iii strains produce toxins of type c or d; and group iv strains produce toxin of type g  <cit> . furthermore, the toxinotypes are divided into many subtypes, which have been defined as toxin sequences differing by at least  <dig> % identity at amino acid level  <cit> . botulinum type a neurotoxins are divided into five subtypes termed a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and more recently to a <dig>  <cit> ; botulinum type b neurotoxins are divided into five subtypes termed b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  bivalent b, and non-proteolytic botulinum b neurotoxin; botulinum type e neurotoxins are classified into six subtypes: e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig>  <cit> ; and botulinum type f neurotoxins are separated into f <dig> through f <dig> subtypes  <cit> . there are no known subtypes from types c, d, and g  <cit> .

the strains of c. botulinum used for the production of type a therapeutic toxin  are likely to originate from those isolated and preserved by ivan c. hall in the early 1900s. these strains, which include include several type a strains from botulism cases in the western united states  <cit>  and both type a and b strains from isolated wounds  <cit> , were distributed to colleges and universities throughout the world and deposited in various culture collections  <cit> . as a result, many subcultures were performed, and the strains designated as "hall" strains may not be identical to or may differ from the original isolates as a result of long term passage.

in this communication, the genetic diversity of c. botulinum was further explored by comparing the genomic differences among several c. botulinum strains including sanger institute atcc  <dig> , cdc atcc  <dig> , atcc  <dig> , hall , allergan, and university of massachusetts dartmouth laboratory hall strain , all belonging to subtype a <dig>  the results indicated that genetic diversity existed among these subtype a <dig> strains including those designated simply as "hall".

RESULTS
c. botulinum a <dig> neurotoxin gene complex
the c. botulinum type a <dig> neurotoxin complex genomic cluster spans  <dig> bp in atcc  <dig> . the identical genomic cluster was also found in four other genome sequences, whose genbank accession numbers are cp <dig> , cp <dig> , dq <dig> , and af <dig> .

the botulinum type a <dig> neurotoxin complex consists of six genes, namely, ha <dig>  ha <dig>  ha <dig>  botr, ntnh, and bont/a, whose coding regions in aggregate consist of  <dig> bp out of  <dig> bp botulinum a neurotoxin genomic cluster . sequence alignment of this cluster with each individual gene sequence  from the allergan hall strain  <cit>  revealed that only two base pairs were different: one was in the region encoding the heavy chain of neurotoxin botulinum type a <dig>  the other was in botr region . both are synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms , which are not predicted to result in an amino acid change.

the botulinum neurotoxin type a <dig> gene  from the umass strain was also sequenced and compared to that of atcc  <dig> and allergan hall strains. the umass sequence was identical to atcc  <dig> but different from allergan hall strain by one base pair . we did not sequence the botr region in umass strain, therefore, it is unclear whether the snp in botr region exists or not.

comparative genomic hybridization of umass strain
the comparative genomic hybridization  microarray featured overlapping probes covering the entire c. botulinum a <dig> strain atcc  <dig> genome sequence . the atcc 3502* strain was used as reference and the umass strain as test strain. the hybridization results indicated the presence of several regions that were different between umass strain and sanger institute atcc  <dig> strain , and, in some cases, were even different between atcc 3502* and sanger institute atcc  <dig> strain . the nature of the deleted sequence  in figure  <dig> is unclear. the same block sequence was also found in atcc  <dig> genome but not in hall strain genome, as retrieved through ncbi blast server.

genome organizations of c. botulinum a <dig> strains
as mentioned above, three fully sequenced c. botulinum a <dig> strain genomes are deposited in genbank: atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  and hall. mauve software  <cit>  was used to compare and analyze the organization of these genomes. at the gross level, based on the atcc  <dig> genome organization, all three genomes were divided into four blocks: blocks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  sequentially .

the three genomes were divided into two organizational patterns. atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> share the same pattern, while the positions of block  <dig> and block  <dig> were translocated in hall, suggesting a genomic rearrangement event may have occurred among these strains. moreover, within the same pattern and between genomes of atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  many regions inside the comparable blocks were different, as shown in areas that are completely white in figure  <dig>  interestingly, two such regions  in the atcc  <dig> genome are prophages that are absent in two other fully sequenced c. botulinum a <dig> strains: hall and atcc  <dig> . these observations are in agreement with previous reports  <cit>  and also confirmed by our cgh findings .

characterization of the atcc 3502* and umass hall strain genome organizational patterns
to characterize whether the genome organizational pattern of atcc 3502* and umass hall strain fits into either of above two patterns, a pcr strategy was utilized. primers were designed to span the boundary between block  <dig> and block  <dig> for the atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> pattern or between block  <dig> and block  <dig> for the hall pattern . in one set of pcr reactions, using atcc 3502* genomic dna as template, the expected pcr product was generated from every pcr reaction with different combinations of upstream and downstream primers for atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> pattern  but not from those with different combination of primers for hall pattern reactions . these results demonstrated that the genomic organization of atcc 3502* indeed was identical to the atcc  <dig> sanger institute and atcc  <dig> strain genome organizations.

in the other set of pcr reactions, using umass strain genomic dna as template, none of the pcr reactions containing one of four different primer combinations generated a product for atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> pattern ; however, every pcr reaction containing one of four different primer combinations amplified the predictable size of pcr products for hall pattern . the largest pcr product derived from pcr reaction with upstream primer  and downstream primer  combination and using umass strain genomic dna as template was cloned and sequenced. the sequence from this product was 100% identical to the corresponding region in the hall strain genome, confirming that the genomic organization of umass strain belonged to hall type.

analysis of the region containing the sequenced pcr product demonstrated that the region is further divided into f <dig> fragment  that is located in 3'-end of block  <dig> of hall strain genome and f <dig> fragment  that is located in 5'-end of block  <dig> of hall strain genome. as shown in figure  <dig>  the f <dig> and f <dig> fragments, a continuous region in hall strain genome, were split into two separate fragments in atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> strain genomes, although each remained within their individual rearranged blocks.

further analysis of block  <dig>  revealed that virtually identical sequences are found in strain atcc  <dig>  and strain hall . the gc content  of block  <dig> in strain atcc  <dig> is not significantly different from  <dig> % of whole genome gc content for each sequenced subtype a <dig> strain genome. within block  <dig>  we identified two  <dig> bp inverted repeat sequences  that are located before the first gene in the block  and after the last gene in the block . notably, no genes encoding a transposase or a direct repeat sequence  was found in the region. in addition, the downstream inverted repeat has no overlapping sequence with f <dig> fragment mentioned above.

discussion
genetic diversity has been described in other pathogenic bacterial species  <cit> . in one study,  <dig> c. difficile strains isolated from different resources were analyzed by cgh with microarrays containing coding sequences from c. difficile strains  <dig> and qcd-32g <dig>  startlingly, only about 16% of the genes in strain  <dig> were highly conserved among all strains  <cit> . in another study, comparison of the laboratory strain escherichia coli k <dig> to both uropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic strains revealed that less than 40% of the total number of genes present were shared by these three strains  <cit> . quite recently, cgh was performed on a relatively large scale to compare  <dig> strains of proteolytic c. botulinum and c. sporogenes using atcc  <dig> as reference strain  <cit> . approximately 63% of the coding sequences  present in reference strain atcc  <dig> were common to all  <dig> strains. even within the toxin gene cluster, a typically conserved region, the gene arrangement could be different between different serotypes or subtypes of the same serotype  <cit> . the differences in the genome organization of the atcc 3502* strain and atcc  <dig> , as shown in this report, further substantiated the dynamic nature of botulinum strain genome.

lateral  gene transfer, through transformation, transduction, and conjugation, is a major mechanism for the generation of genetic diversity in pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . in c. botulinum, the neurotoxin cluster has been shown to be present within plasmids or on the chromosome in strains of the same or different serotypes, which is consistent with horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . none of the subtype a <dig> strains, whose genomes were sequenced, harbor the toxin gene on a plasmid. one plasmid, pbot <dig>  existing in the atcc  <dig> sanger institute strain, was not found in the atcc  <dig> and hall strains  <cit>  and, even more strikingly, not in the atcc 3502* strain genome sequences  <cit> . further work is required to determine whether and if so, at what rate, loss of this plasmid occurs during laboratory passage.

the subtype a <dig> strain genetic diversity was also evidenced by the different location of genome block  <dig> when strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> are compared with strain hall. although this  <dig> bp block contained two inverted repeat sequence fragments, we were unable to find direct repeat sequences or any gene that encodes a transposase. therefore, we are unable to ascribe the genomic block switch observed in this study to a transposon-related mobile element mechanism  <cit> . whether such differences in genomic arrangement among the subtype a <dig> strains examined has an effect on botulinum neurotoxin production remains to be elucidated.

in this report, the botulinum type a <dig> neurotoxin complex gene sequences of several strains were compared. there are at least five neurotoxin complex clusters from c. botulinum type a <dig> strains which have been fully sequenced and deposited into public databases. sequence analysis showed that the sequences of five fully sequenced neurotoxin complex clusters were identical, and their gene coding regions and toxin gene complex from allergan hall strain displayed two synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms: one is in the region encoding toxin heavy chain, the other in botr. these findings are quite different from those in an earlier report which showed that there were 93%, 94%, and 97% identities in the genes ntnh, botr, and ha <dig> at amino acid level, respectively  <cit> . the apparent discrepancy of these findings is likely due to different versions of genomic sequence that were used: version 16-apr- <dig>  of atcc  <dig> hall strain was used in allergan's report, while version 21-nov- <dig>  of atcc  <dig> hall strain was used in this report.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, genetic diversity exists among the botulinum subtype a <dig> strains examined in this study. the neurotoxin gene of the umass strain exhibited the same nucleotide sequence as that of other published subtype a <dig> strains, except for the allergan hall strain. at the whole genome level, umass strain, atcc3502*, and sanger institute  <dig> strains, atcc  <dig>  and hall demonstrated differences in both gene content and genome arrangement.
