BACKGROUND
sound travels as waves of compressed air into the outer ear; it is amplified by the movement of ossicles in the middle ear; and finally is converted into a neuronal signal in the inner ear. in the organ of corti, sound stimulation of the sensory "hair" cells leads to release of glutamate to initiate neuronal signals which are carried to and processed in the brain. the organ of corti is a specialised epithelial tissue containing three rows of outer hair cells, one row of inner hair cells and a variety of supporting cells. each hair cell is surrounded by and separated from its neighbours by intervening supporting cells. the bodies of the supporting cells also intervene between the base of the hair cells and the basilar membrane, the extracellular matrix that underlies the organ of corti, such that supporting cells, but not hair cells are attached to the basilar membrane. the base of each hair cell is in contact with a nerve terminal where the mechanical sound signal is converted into an electrical nerve signal.

the cellular composition and architecture of the organ of corti is critical to its function  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that both hair cells and supporting cells are derived from a common precursor  <cit> . however, the mechanisms of maturation of the organ of corti are largely unknown  <cit> . identification of the factors involved in the differentiation and maturation of the organ of corti is of interest not only to understand the possible cause of congenital hearing defects but also to understand why the mammalian organ of corti is unable to regenerate hair when these are killed as a consequence of the effects of damaging agents such as noise or ototoxins or with ageing  <cit> .

during maturation of the organ of corti, the division of precursor cells into supporting cells and a hair cells is characterised by the detachment of the precursor cells from basilar membrane during the mitotic phase and the formation of the supporting cell that re-attaches to the basilar membrane while the hair cell does not  <cit> . in epithelial tissues, the attachment and detachment of cells to and from the basement membrane is known to be mediated by integrin proteins binding to extracellular matrix protein  <cit> . integrins are a family of transmembrane proteins that form heterodimeric surface receptors composed of an α and β subunit  <cit> . the integrin receptor heterodimers have specific affinities for extracellular proteins commonly found in the basement membrane and, upon binding, they are capable of sending signals which can determine developmental processes in the cells  <cit> . there is evidence that integrins are expressed in the inner ear  <cit>  and that they play an important functional role as demonstrated by the effect of mutations  <cit> . however, their role in the differentiation and maintenance of the organ of corti requires further investigation. in this study we have chosen to use a cell line  derived from embryonic day  <dig>  immortomouse inner ear  <cit> . this cell line has previously been demonstrated to have certain characteristics of developing inner ear epithelial cells. oc- <dig> cells can be maintained in a proliferative state at 33°c but when switched to 39°c the cells express a number of markers characteristic of mature hair cells  <cit> . in this study we have investigated the expression of several integrins in oc- <dig> cells and their role in controlling the differentiation processes of oc- <dig> cells. we demonstrate that among the integrins detected in oc- <dig> cells the expression of β <dig> is directly related to the production of myosin viia, a marker of differentiated hair cells.

RESULTS
increased integrin expression in differentiated oc- <dig> cells
to confirm that oc- <dig> cells grown at 39°c for  <dig> weeks had differentiated, myosin vi and myosin viia levels were examined by western blot analysis. as has been shown previously  <cit> , differentiated oc- <dig> cells increased their expression of both myosin vi and viia   with respect to undifferentiated cells.

facs and western blot analysis were utilized to quantify the relative changes of expression of the integrin subunits during the differentiation of oc- <dig> cells. oc- <dig> cells were screened for integrin expression and the integrin subunits α <dig>  αv, β <dig> and β <dig> were detected  but not α1-, α2-, α5- and β4-integrin subunits . the expression of α6-integrin subunit was not significantly different between undifferentiated and differentiated oc- <dig> cells. in contrast, αv- and β1-integrin surface levels were increased in differentiated oc- <dig> cells when compared with undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells  . no expression of β3-integrin was observed in undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells but this receptor was expressed after the oc- <dig> cells had undergone differentiation . similar results were obtained when total protein levels of these integrin subunits were examined by western blot analysis . to verify our in vitro findings, rt-pcr for the integrin subunits α <dig>  αv, β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig>  was performed on rna isolated from cochlear tissue of adult mice . all integrin subunits examined were expressed in mouse cochlear tissue, to varying levels, apart from β4-integrin, which also was not expressed on oc- <dig> cells.

time course of integrin expression profiles during differentiation
having shown that differentiated oc- <dig> cells had increased expression of αv, β <dig> and β3-integrin, we analysed the pattern of integrin expression over the  <dig> day differentiation period. oc- <dig> cells, cultured at 33°c, were transferred to 39°c and integrin expression was examined every  <dig> days for  <dig> days, when the cells had fully differentiated. unsurprisingly, α6-integrin levels did not alter during the  <dig> day differentiation period . αv-integrin expression levels remained similar to levels seen at 33°c cells for the first  <dig> days during differentiation. by day  <dig> of differentiation, αv-integrin expression levels increased to the levels observed in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells , and remained so until oc- <dig> cells were fully differentiated . however, we did observe that at day  <dig> of differentiation, the level of αv-integrin expression was increased to a level above that found in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells.

β1-integrin expression increased from day  <dig> of differentiation when compared with undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells. β1-integrin levels gradually increased until day  <dig>  at which time β1-integrin surface expression was comparable to levels observed in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells . it was noted that throughout the early stages of differentiation , a small population of differentiating oc- <dig> cells expressed β1-integrin at a level comparable with fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. no surface expression of β3-integrin was seen during the first  <dig> days of the differentiation process, but by day  <dig>  expression of this integrin increased with time, reaching the level of expression observed in differentiated oc- <dig> cells by day  <dig> . western blot analysis of all the described integrin subunits showed similar patterns of integrin expression during the differentiation process, while the increase in myosin viia and myosin vi that occurs with differentiation  started being evident from day  <dig> and day  <dig> respectively .

functional correlation between integrin expression and myosin viia levels
having shown that changes in the integrin expression profiles during differentiation coincided with changes in myosin vi and myosin viia levels, we wished to confirm a functional role for these integrins in this process. fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells were transfected with sirna targeted specifically to either αv-, α6-, β1- or β3-integrin subunits or a scrambled control sirna, followed by analysis of myosin viia levels. we optimised the time of maximum effect of sirna on the respective protein surface expression  and confirmed sirna treatment had no effect on cell proliferation and was non-toxic to the cells .

western blot analysis showed that sirna inhibition of all integrin subunits significantly reduced the level of expression of myosin viia in comparison with fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells, to levels similar to those observed in undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells . myosin viia levels were decreased most effectively in the presence of αv and β3-integrin sirna . to investigate the specificity of action of the integrin subunits we have measured the effect of some of the integrin sirna on the expression of other integrin subunits. all integrin sirnas, but not scrambled sirnas significantly reduced the surface expression of their respective proteins and in some cases also other integrins. for example  β3-sirna caused a significant reduction of surface expression of β <dig>  αv, β <dig> but not α <dig>  other examples of non-significant effect of sirnas were α6-sirnaand αv-sirna on β <dig> expression . these data indicate that the effect of the sirnas is specific but there is interdependency in the surface expression of different integrin subunits.

having shown that β3-integrin diplayed the most dramatic change in integrin expression during madifferentiation of the oc <dig> cells and that knockdown of this integrin was the most effective at reducing the expression of myosin viia, we over expressed β3-integrin in undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells to generate a phenotype similar to fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. retroviral transduction of undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells with human β3-integrin was confirmed by facs analysis  and showed surface expression levels similar to those observed in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. this over expression of β3-integrin, in turn, increased the expression of myosin viia to levels similar to those in fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells. indeed, myosin viia levels were increased significantly in transduced cells when compared with undifferentiated oc- <dig> cells. the effect of over expression of human β3-integrin on other integrin expression patterns was examined by facs analysis. α6-integrin surface levels did not change in response to increased β3-integrin, whereas αv-integrin, and, to a lesser extent, β1-integrin showed increased surface expression after transduction with human β3-integrin .

discussion
in this study we have utilised the oc- <dig> cell line to study the role of integrin proteins in the regulation of differentiation of this cell line. the oc- <dig> cells display only some of the characteristics of the cells of the organ of corti from where they have been derived. however, they do have a temporal pattern of gene expression that reflects the developmental processes observed in the organ of corti. therefore we believe the findings reported here can be considered of significance for the understanding of the maturation and/or regeneration processes of the organ of corti. in this study we have observed in differentiating oc <dig> cells a differential pattern of developmental expression of integrin subunits ranging from no change as in α <dig>  to an increase from sub-detectable levels to higher levels for β <dig>  other variations included a peak of αv expression at day  <dig> above the level of the fully differentiated cells and the presence of a sub-population of differentiating cells with high β <dig> expression. taken as a whole these expression patterns indicate a complex relationship between integrin expression and the differentiation of oc <dig> cells. in this study we have began to unravel this complexity by establishing a temporal and functional relationship between the expression of integrins and the expression of the mature hair cell markers .

this study did not aim to identify all the possible integrins that are expressed by oc- <dig> and it is plausible that other integrins may also be expressed and affect differentiation of oc- <dig> cells. our interest was directed at verifying our hypothesis that the expression of some integrins can be functionally correlated to the expression of hair cell differentiation markers. our data demonstrate at least one integrin subunit  plays such role in the expression of the hair cell differentiation marker myosin viia. expression of β <dig> integrin appears to be both necessary, as demonstrated by the decrease of expression of myosin viia in differentiated oc- <dig> cells exposed to β3-sirna, and sufficient as indicated by the expression of myosin viia in undifferentiated cells virally transfected with β3-integrin gene. our sirna data and β3-transfections data also indicate that the expression of one integrin subunit can affect the surface expression of other integrins subunits. the specificity of this latter effect is substantiated by the fact that scrambled sirna did not affect the expression of any integrin subunits and some integrin sirna  did not inhibit the expression of specific integrins . a full investigation of all the respective inhibitory effects of integrin sirna on other integrin subunits was not within the scope of this study. however, of our data does suggest that this would be a worthwhile aim. the transcriptional expression of one integrin subunit could affect the surface expression of another integrin by a number of mechanisms ranging from transcriptional regulation of gene expression to post-translation modulation of integrin receptor assembly. the β <dig> subunit predominantly dimerises with αv to form a functional integrin receptor  <cit> ; further studies would be required to establish whether the β <dig> subunit competes with other beta subunits to dimerise with αv, or whether the observed increase in αv is sufficient to form additional functional dimers with β <dig> 

interaction between integrins and cytoskeletal proteins, including myosins, has been reported in several systems including the inner ear <cit> . what is of particular interest with respect to the organ of corti is that the differentiation of the precursors of hair cells and supporting cells involves detachment from the basilar membrane which is composed of extracellular matrix proteins recognised by integrin complexes  <cit> . the data described in this paper, if confirmed in the organ of corti, would help to elucidate a central mechanism of the developmental processes of the inner ear and may lead to a better understanding of the lack of regeneration of inner ear tissue following injury. the oc- <dig> cells represent a good model for testing some of the potential mechanism of integrin involvement in hair cells development. however to more faithfully mimic the events that occur in vivo it would also be necessary to reproduce the changes in extracellular proteins that have been shown to occur in the organ of corti during development <cit> . while our data demonstrate a clear link between integrin expression and oc- <dig> cell differentiation, it would be premature to utilise our data to speculate on the exact mechanisms of the development of hair cells. to better understand the differentiation mechanisms that take place in the oc- <dig> cells, further work will be conducted to elucidate the relationship between integrin subunit expression and other hair cell markers such as the alpha  <dig> subunit of the acetylcholine receptor  <cit>  as well as other signalling proteins known to be associated with integrins  <cit> . ultimately, it will be necessary to demonstrate that the developmental mechanisms observed in oc <dig> cells also take place in the organ of corti.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that in oc- <dig> cells there is causal relationship between β3- integrin expression and the expression of the hair cell differentiation marker myosin viia. these data could reflect similar events occurring during the development of the organ of corti.
