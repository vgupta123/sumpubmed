BACKGROUND
during the past decade, next generation sequencing  technologies have revolutionized the field of human genetics. since the first draft of the human genome was published in  <dig>  <cit> , a multitude of personal genomes have been sequenced  <cit> . large-scale efforts of whole genome sequencing  of human samples have mainly focused on population-based studies  <cit>  and cancer genomes  <cit> . for most research groups, wgs of many samples remains a costly endeavor, and targeted capture followed by sequencing of selected genomic regions of interest provides an attractive, cost-effective alternative. target capture of custom designed regions and exome sequencing has allowed identification of causal variants in several mendelian disorders  <cit> , variants associated with complex diseases  <cit> , and recurrently mutated cancer genes  <cit> .

target capture technologies can be categorized into methods based on pcr amplification, hybrid capture, or selective circularization  <cit> . the haloplex technology is a selective circularization-based method which is a further development of the principle of selector probes . in the haloplex technology, genomic dna is fragmented by restriction enzyme digestion and circularized by hybridization to probes whose ends are complementary to the target fragments. compared to hybrid capture methods, the haloplex system requires smaller amounts of starting dna, has higher specificity , and provides more even genome coverage  <cit> . the sample preparation is less laborious because incorporation of sequencing adapters during capture obviates the need for a separate library preparation step. however, a maximum of 5 mb of custom designed regions can be enriched with current protocols, which is little compared to for example 24 mb for sureselect hybrid capture.

to further decrease costs, samples can be pooled prior to capture. indexing of samples before pooling allows posterior identification of the sample where a variant occurred, and results in more accurate estimation of allele frequencies. however, the presence of an additional index tag may complicate experimental procedures, decrease capture specificity, and result in a substantial proportion of reads with an inappropriate index tag  <cit> . indexed pooling is feasible in hybrid capture methods, where the sequencing library is prepared before capture, but not for the current haloplex protocol, where the capture is performed on genomic dna. pooling without indexing can be done at the level of genomic dna, and is thus an efficient approach in terms of reagent costs and experimental work load. while non-indexed pooling has not yet been used with the haloplex technology, several studies have evaluated the performance of non-indexed pools using hybrid capture. these studies have yielded conflicting results, with some observing accurate snp calling and determination of allele frequencies  <cit> , while others observe poor allele frequency estimates or failure to validate snps with minor allele frequencies below 25%  <cit> .

previous studies of non-indexed pooling aimed at establishing methods for detecting rare variants in complex phenotypes, using hapmap cell lines or other non-tumor samples. to our knowledge, pooling of cancer samples for identification of somatic single nucleotide variants  has not been evaluated to date. in contrast to germline snps, most somatic snvs are not expected to be recurrent in the population, nor in other individuals with the same type of cancer. additionally, cancer samples often consist of multiple tumor subclones in mixtures with normal cells, and the proportion of sequence reads containing an snv can therefore be very low in pools of cancer samples. another consideration when working with tumor samples is that dna resources are often limited. whole genome amplification  by multiple displacement amplification is a standard method to increase dna quantity. evaluation of whole genome amplified dna  for genotyping purposes has shown that the allele fractions in the original sample are retained provided that a sufficient amount of genomic dna is used  <cit> . the use of wgadna in wgs can result in uneven coverage and introduce false positive inversions  <cit> , and in hybrid capture it has been associated with accurate snp detection but a slightly decreased capture specificity  <cit> . however, it has not been properly investigated using ngs how well the allele fractions of somatic snvs are preserved during wga.

in this study, we investigated the power to detect somatic snvs in non-indexed pools of up to ten cancer samples and the effect of wga on capture specificity and allele fractions using haloplex target enrichment. we analyzed  <dig> candidate snvs and snps identified by wgs of matched cancer and normal samples from two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia .

RESULTS
design of haloplex target enrichment experiment
for evaluation of the performance of whole genome amplified dna  and non-indexed pooling in haloplex target enrichment, we selected  <dig> candidate single nucleotide variants  detected during whole genome sequencing  of two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . thirty of the snvs were previously validated as somatic by pcr and sanger sequencing, and one had been shown to be a false positive. no indels were included. the candidate snvs selected for evaluation of the haloplex target enrichment system included  <dig> snvs from patient  <dig> and  <dig> from patient  <dig>  two of the snvs overlapped between the patients. we also selected  <dig> germline snps that were heterozygous in both patients. for each of these  <dig> variants , we defined a target region of 3 bp, including one base upstream and one base downstream of each variant. in addition, we selected the exons of  <dig> genes and five custom regions with a size ranging from  <dig> to 263 bp. the total number of target regions was  <dig>  and together they spanned 147 kb. the design obtained from agilent had a total size of 798 kb and covered  <dig> % of the region of interest. a total of  <dig>  of the snvs and snps were covered by the design, including  <dig> candidate snvs  and  <dig> of the  <dig> germline snps. the failure to completely cover a region of interest can be attributed to repeated regions in the flanking sequences, lack of restriction fragments of appropriate size, or too large fragments relative to the read length leading to partial sequencing of fragments.

a total of twelve samples or pools were subjected to target capture using the haloplex system . first, for validation of putative snvs detected in wgs data, we included genomic dna  from cancer and normal samples from the two whole genome sequenced all patients, here called all <dig>  all <dig>  normal <dig>  and normal <dig>  second, to evaluate the effect of whole genome amplification, we included wgadna from the all <dig> and all <dig> samples. third, for evaluation of non-indexed pooling, we prepared three pools of two, five or ten all samples. each pool contained either the all <dig> or the all <dig> sample, and the additional samples were present in only one pool each. the pools were prepared in replicate by an independent pooling procedure.table  <dig>

sequence data and allele fractions
between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the raw sequence reads mapped to the human genome, and  <dig> - <dig> % of these mapped to the target region . the average sequence depth ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in the region covered by the haloplex design, and from  <dig> to  <dig> at the  <dig> snvs and snps covered by the capture design . virtually all snvs and snps were covered by at least one sequence read, and  <dig> - <dig> % of the variants were covered at a sequence depth of at least  <dig> . to determine the accuracy of the allele fractions in the haloplex sequence data we utilized the  <dig> heterozygous germline snps, which are expected to have an allele fraction of  <dig>  in individual samples from both cancer and normal cells. the allele fractions of these snps deviated from the expected  <dig>  by an average of  <dig>  in the haloplex data, compared to  <dig>  in the wgs data, demonstrating that the increased sequencing depth in the haloplex data is associated with increased precision of allele fractions .

somatic snvs
accurate identification of somatic snvs in wgs data is challenging. different snv callers often yield different results and large numbers of false positive calls  <cit> , and experimental validation is often required. target capture and deep sequencing is a well established method for validation of large numbers of putative snvs detected in wgs data . here, we used the haloplex deep-sequencing data to classify our candidate snvs as somatic or “non-validated”. at the sites where a putative snv was detected in the wgs data, we determined the allele fractions in the haloplex data, and classified an snv as somatic if it had an allele fraction ≥ <dig>  in the gdna all sample and < <dig>  in the matched normal sample. we also required a sequence depth ≥ <dig> in both samples in the sequencing data from haloplex enrichment. this resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> snvs classified as somatic in all <dig> and all <dig>  respectively, corresponding to approximately one third of the candidate snvs called from wgs data . as a measure of confidence, all of the  <dig> previously validated somatic snvs were classified as somatic in the haloplex sequence data. the candidate snv that had previously been shown to be a false positive by sanger sequencing had no supporting reads in the haloplex data.figure  <dig> 
allele fractions for putative single nucleotide variants  in all and normal samples. the allele fractions observed in haloplex sequence data for  <dig> candidate snvs in all and normal samples. only data from libraries derived from genomic dna are shown. snvs classified as somatic are shown in red. candidate snvs that follow the x = y line represent putative germline snps that escaped detection in the normal sample during wgs or alignment artifacts. the cluster with allele fractions close to  <dig> in both all and normal samples represents likely false positive snv calls. most of the candidate snvs with allele fractions close to  <dig> in the all sample and around  <dig>  in the normal sample in patient  <dig> are located in a large region of somatic loss of heterozygosity.



the candidate snvs that were not somatic displayed three distinctive patterns. first, many candidate snvs align along the diagonal, with similar allele fractions in the all and normal samples. these snvs could possibly be germline snps that escaped detection in the normal sample in the wgs data. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that they have significantly lower coverage in the wgs data in the normal sample than the validated somatic snvs . we also observed significantly lower confidence scores from snv calling in wgs, as measured by the somatic score from somaticsniper  <cit> , in this group of candidate snvs . however, germline snps would be expected to have an allele fraction close to  <dig> . analysis of mappability scores and overlaps with segmental duplications suggests that some of the putatively germline snps with deviating allele fractions might be located in repeated regions of the genome that had escaped our filters . manual inspection of sequence alignments suggests that other candidates in this category are false positive snvs caused by alignment artifacts. second, there is a cluster of non-validated snvs in the lower left corner in figure  <dig>  similarly to the previous category, these candidate snvs display low coverage in the normal sample in wgs data and low somatic scores . this observation suggests that the failure to detect these snvs in the haloplex data is not caused by allelic dropout during haloplex enrichment, but rather by sequencing errors or alignment artifacts in combination with low coverage leading to false positive snv calls in the wgs data. third, all <dig> shows a cluster of candidate snvs with allele fractions around  <dig>  in the normal sample and close to  <dig> in the all sample. most of these variants are located in a previously known large chromosomal region of somatic loss of heterozygosity.

to further verify that our criteria for classifying a putative snv as somatic are valid, ten somatic snvs , with allele fractions between  <dig>  and  <dig> , were randomly selected for pcr and sanger sequencing. all ten snvs were successfully validated as being somatic. this result, along with the different properties of somatic and non-validated snvs, shows that we can accurately validate somatic snvs using haloplex enrichment and deep sequencing.

comparison of wgadna and gdna
to evaluate whether alleles were lost or allele fractions were altered during whole genome amplification, we compared the results from gdna and wgadna in the samples all <dig> and all <dig>  the percentage of reads on target was slightly higher for the wgadna samples than for the gdna samples, showing that whole genome amplification does not have a negative effect on capture specificity . a possible explanation for the higher specificity of wgadna samples would be that genomic regions that are easier to capture with the haloplex method are preferentially amplified during the wga process. however, since the number of experiments is limited, the observed pattern could also be caused by random variation. a slightly smaller number of variants had a sequence depth ≥ <dig> and ≥ <dig> in the wgadna samples . further investigation showed that the coverage in wgadna samples is more uneven, with more sites covered by a relatively low or high number of reads . there was no correlation between the amount of input dna, which ranged from  <dig> to 1000 ng in the pools, and the evenness of the coverage , suggesting that using more of the wgadna would not have yielded more even coverage. these results indicate that in order to achieve adequate coverage of the target regions, it is important to sequence wgadna samples at sufficient depth. the number of snvs classified as somatic was similar in the gdna and wgadna samples . a total of  <dig> snvs were classified as somatic in only one of the gdna and wgadna experiments using the same sample . five of them can be explained by lack of coverage in the wgadna sample. manual inspection of the sequence data at the remaining snvs suggested that the inconsistencies were due to alignment artifacts or allele fractions close to the cutoff, rather than allelic dropout during whole genome amplification.figure  <dig>

for analysis of how well allele fractions are preserved during whole genome amplification, we used all candidate snvs detected in the wgs data as well as the germline snps, with a sequence depth ≥ <dig> in both gdna and wgadna experiments . this was because allele fractions are expected to be preserved for all variants. in addition, including all variants allows investigation of the preservation of the allele fractions across the complete range of allele fractions . cancer samples with variants with varying allele fractions are therefore particularly well suited to assess how well allele fractions are preserved during whole genome amplification. the error in allele fraction for the  <dig> germline snps was slightly smaller in wgadna than in gdna, suggesting that the uneven coverage in wgadna samples does not affect the allele fractions . we observed a high correlation between allele fractions obtained in data from gdna and wgadna experiments, with pearson correlation coefficients of  <dig>  in both patients . the reason why the two patients have the same correlation value, although there appears to be more variation in all <dig>  is that the cluster of data points in the upper right corner has a major effect on the correlation. to better estimate the variation in the datasets, we also calculated the root mean square error . this value was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for all <dig> and all <dig>  respectively. in addition to demonstrating that wgadna provides a good substitute for gdna when dna resources are limited, our results highlight the technical reproducibility of haloplex enrichment.figure  <dig>

allele fractions in pooled dna samples
for evaluation of variant detection and how well allele fractions are preserved in pools, we focused on the somatic snvs . these variants are likely to be unique to the whole genome sequenced sample, and therefore an expected allele fraction for each variant can be calculated by dividing the allele fraction in the individual gdna sample with the number of samples in the pool. in contrast, germline snps are more likely to be present in some of the additional samples included in the pool, which hinders the use of these variants to determine the precision of the method. a comparison between observed and expected allele fractions showed good correlation in all pools . the allele fractions in the pools containing all <dig> displayed higher levels of correlation than the pool containing all <dig>  a possible explanation is that all <dig> contains clear leukemic subclones with approximately half of the snvs having an allele fraction around  <dig>  and the remaining having an allele fraction around  <dig>  . in contrast, the majority of somatic snvs in all <dig> have an allele fraction around  <dig> , and this lower variability decreases the correlation. in all2_pool <dig> and all1_pool <dig>  the observed allele fractions were on average higher than the expected. we quantified the deviation between observed and expected allele fractions by calculating the median ratio of x- and y-values in each plot. this ratio would be close to  <dig> if the data is evenly distributed around the x-y line, as in the case of all1_pool <dig>  for all2_pool <dig> and all1_pool <dig> the ratio was around  <dig> . this result suggests that approximately 25% and 12%, respectively, of these pools consisted of the all <dig> and all <dig> samples, compared to the expected 20% and 10%.figure  <dig> 
correlation between expected and observed allele fractions in pools and comparison of replicated pools. the top panel shows the correlation between expected and observed allele fractions in the three pools, where the expected value is calculated by dividing the allele fraction observed in the all <dig> or all <dig> genomic dna  sample with the number of samples in the pool. only single nucleotide variants  classified as somatic in the all <dig>  or all <dig>  gdna samples are shown. the bottom panel shows the correlation between allele fractions in the replicated pools. the x- and y-axes are cut at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the pools with two, five and ten samples, respectively. snvs with an observed allele fraction greater than this are shown in black at the cutoff value. the mr value is the median ratio between all x- and y-values in each plot. it represents how close the two distributions are to each other, with a value of  <dig> indicating similar distributions.



when comparing the pool replicates against each other, the correlation between observed allele fractions was somewhat lower than the correlation between observed and expected values in the “original” pool . this was not unexpected, since the variance is likely to increase in pools compared to individual reactions due to additional experimental factors and decreased sequencing depth per sample. thus, in the replicate plots we compare two high-variance experiments, while in the observed-expected plots the expected values are obtained from a low-variance experiment. despite increased variance, the median ratio between allele fractions in the replicates was close to  <dig>  suggesting that pooling is reproducible and that the skewed distributions in all2_pool <dig> and all1_pool <dig> may be caused by inaccurate dna quantification of the individual samples in the pools or by variations from pipetting small volumes of dna samples during pooling.

variant detection in pooled dna samples
since the genome sequence was unknown for all samples in the pools, except all <dig> and all <dig>  we could not use the entire target region to estimate the accuracy of the snv calling. instead we focused on the sites for which we have genetic information about somatic snvs in all <dig> and all <dig>  since we used an allele fraction cutoff of  <dig>  to call a somatic snv in the haloplex data, the lowest expected allele fraction in a pool is  <dig>  divided by the number of samples in the pool. to allow for inaccuracy of the dna quantification or pipetting, and random variation of sequenced molecules, a somatic snv was considered to be detected in a pool if the allele fraction at this site was at least half the lowest expected value. to estimate the number of true negatives and false positives, we reasoned that the somatic snvs are rare, so that somatic snvs detected in all <dig> would not be present in pools containing all <dig> and vice versa. this analysis showed that the vast majority of the known snvs present in a single sample can be reliably detected in the pools, with the number of false negatives ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and the number of false positives ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . as expected, more false positives were observed in pools of many samples, however, the false discovery rate was below 6% for all pools . to investigate whether the higher observed than expected allele fractions in all2_pool <dig> and all1_pool <dig> cause an upward bias in the number of detected snvs, we adjusted the observed allele fractions by dividing them by the median ratio between observed and expected values. snv calling using the adjusted allele fractions showed that only one of all the snvs that were detected in the original analysis remained undetected after scaling. thus, the overrepresentation of all <dig> and all <dig> in these pools does not influence the accuracy estimate. a closer inspection of the snvs that remained undetected in pools revealed that the majority had a low expected allele fraction and a relatively low sequence depth , suggesting that deeper sequencing would allow detection of most snvs. we also found that the snvs that remained undetected in at least one pool had a significantly lower sequence depth in the individual all <dig> and all <dig> samples compared to the remaining snvs, suggesting that they may be located in genomic regions that are difficult to enrich.table  <dig>

c putative novel snvs called in the previously uncharacterized samples included in the pools. one of the variants called in all2_pool <dig> was not called in the corresponding replicated pool . all other novel variants were identical between replicates.



to investigate whether novel variants could be discovered in the previously uncharacterized samples in the pools, we performed a de novo snv calling in the entire region of interest  by calculating the allele fraction at all sites in this region. to filter out putatively germline snps and false positive calls, we set the expected allele fraction for a somatic snv present in a single sample in a pool to  <dig>  divided by the number of samples included in the pool and we selected only variants with an allele fraction between half and twice the expected value. we also filtered against dbsnp and the other experiments included in the study . after applying these filters, we identified six high-confidence candidate somatic snvs that were called in both replicates of the same pool . one additional snv was called in pool all2_pool <dig> but not in the replicate of this pool . manual inspection of this variant suggested that it was a false positive call caused by alignment artifacts. we performed pcr and sanger sequencing of each of the samples included in the pools where the six high-confidence snvs were identified. in each case, we were able to show that it was a true variant and in which dna sample it was present. pooling of dna samples before capture thus allows accurate snv detection in many samples at low reagent cost, but at the expense of losing the information of in which sample novel variants are detected, unless experimental validation is performed. if the variants are expected to be so rare that they occur in only one sample, this limitation can potentially be circumvented by using a pool design where each sample is present in two different pools and no other sample is present in both pools  <cit> . in most studies, cancer samples are compared to matched normal controls. non-indexed pooling could be particularly useful for the controls, since variants present in the normal population are not believed to be cancer mutations, even if the presence of the variant in a matched normal sample has not been confirmed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we analyzed  <dig> putative somatic snvs and germline snps with the haloplex target enrichment technology and ngs to evaluate the performance of whole genome amplified dna and the accuracy of snv detection in non-indexed pools of cancer samples. we selected the haloplex technology since it is a novel, fast, and specific method suitable for targeted sequencing of relatively small regions in many samples. we found that the allele fractions of the analyzed variants are well preserved during whole genome amplification, with correlation coefficients of  <dig>  between gdna and wgadna samples, and that wga does not negatively affect capture specificity or variant calling. the possibility of using wgadna is particularly important in cancer research, since the amount of available dna is often a major limitation when working with primary human cancer samples. furthermore, we show that using a sequence depth of 792– <dig>  snvs present in a single sample with allele fractions as low as  <dig>  can be reliably detected in non-indexed pools of up to ten samples. we also identified and experimentally validated six novel variants in the samples that were included in these pools. our results are important, since they show that analysis of a large number of samples, including samples where limited amounts of dna have previously been prohibitive, is possible at low cost. since analysis of many samples significantly increases the chances of finding recurrent cancer genes, our results have great potential to be beneficial for cancer research.
