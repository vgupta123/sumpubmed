BACKGROUND
glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  proteins, also known as shaggy-like kinases, have important roles in a wide range of cellular processes throughout eukaryotes  <cit> . in animal development, products of gsk <dig> homologs participate in the critically important wnt signaling pathway that regulates cellular differentiation, patterning, and growth in perhaps all metazoans  <cit> . the gsk <dig> homolog in the protozoan dictyostelium discoideum is also involved in the regulation of development  <cit> . recognition of possible roles of gsk <dig> in human disease has prompted recent interest in these genes in the field of medicine  <cit> . compared to animals, gsk <dig> genes have radiated into a relatively large multi-gene family in land plants  <cit> . for example, five gsk <dig> genes have been reported from the moss physcomitrella patens <cit> , and  <dig> gsk <dig> genes are present in the genome sequence of the flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . conceivably, therefore, gsk <dig> genes have had a dynamic history of gene duplication during the course of land plant evolution. they have also acquired roles in plant-specific processes. for example, different arabidopsis gsk <dig> genes function in hormonal signaling, osmotic stress responses  <cit> , and flower development  <cit> .

previous phylogenetic analyses suggest that four major lineages evolved in the land plant branch of the gsk <dig> gene family  <cit> , but their origins and relationships are currently unclear. physcomitrella gsk <dig> genes occupy different positions relative to groups of angiosperm genes in various analyses  <cit> , and the positions of fern and gymnosperm gsk <dig> sequences have been similarly fluid . such topological instabilities may be an indication of inadequate sampling, which is often a problem in phylogenetic reconstruction  <cit> , particularly in gene family analyses in which both taxonomic and gene copy representation may be sparse. for example, only three plant genomes were available to yoo et al.  <cit> , and ferns and gymnosperms were represented by just seven sequences in their data set. currently,  <dig> land plant genomes are publically accessible through the phytozome v <dig>  portal  <cit> . we also have a draft genome sequence for amborella trichopoda, which occupies a pivotal phylogenetic position as sister to all other extant flowering plants  <cit> . in addition, the ancestral angiosperm genome  and 1kp  projects provide transcriptome assemblies for taxa representing lineages that are critical for understanding gene family evolution in land plants; mosses, liverworts, lycophytes, monilophytes, and gymnosperms, as well as angiosperms.

here, we use the newly available genomic resources reviewed above to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of gsk <dig> genes in land plants . we include sequences of two chlorophyte algae as outgroups. specifically, we:  clarify the phylogenetic relationships among land plant gsk <dig> genes via our greatly increased taxon sampling,  reconstruct the history of gene duplication and extinction during land plant diversification, and  identify shifts in tissue-preferential expression that may relate to functional diversification in seed plants.

RESULTS
our maximum likelihood phylogeny of land plant gsk <dig> genes , rooted with the chlorophyte algae volvox and chlamydomonas, is largely congruent with established organismal relationships . the basal branches constitute a grade of “bryophyte” sequences, above which the tree topology reveals three ancient gene duplication events along the branches leading to extant tracheophytes , euphyllophytes , and spermatophytes , respectively . these duplication events together produced four groups of seed plant genes that correspond with the gene groups previously identified in arabidopsis <cit> . a subsequent duplication along the branch leading directly to extant angiosperms  produced additional angiosperm-wide gene lineages that we designate as subgroups.

ancestral gsk <dig> copy number in land plants
at the base of the tree, a single gene from the moss physcomitrella is sister to all other land plant genes, and successive branches lead to a clade of six other genes in the physcomitrella genome, followed by a clade in which a single sphagnum  sequence is sister to three sequences from two marchantia species . the branching sequence among these genes implies a duplication event in the ancestral lineage of land plants, with one of the two descendant lineages surviving as a single gene only in physcomitrella. however, since the available sampling of mosses and liverworts is relatively sparse, the present topology might not accurately represent gene phylogeny. therefore, origin of the isolated physcomitrella gene through a more recent duplication, perhaps on the branch leading directly to physcomitrella or extant mosses, remains feasible.

duplication along the ancestral branch to tracheophytes
the first duplication in the land plant lineage of gsk <dig> genes appears to have occurred along the ancestral branch to tracheophytes , a clade that emerged during the silurian period about  <dig> mya  <cit> . this “tracheophyte duplication” produced sister gene lineages  whose subsequent histories have resulted in disproportionate representation among extant taxa. the larger descendant lineage includes three of the four groups of seed plant gsk <dig> genes , and sequences from selaginella and huperzia  are sister to all euphyllophyte genes. its sister lineage, which includes the group iv gsk <dig> genes, must have also originated along the ancestral branch to tracheophytes, but does not include lycophyte sequences . an alternative scenario in which lycophyte genes are placed sister to all euphyllophyte genes, shifting the a <dig> duplication to the ancestral branch to euphyllophytes, was rejected by an approximately unbiased  test  <cit> , p =  <dig> . therefore, the group iv gsk <dig> gene lineage has been lost from lycophytes sometime during their evolutionary history. the selaginella genome lacks a group iv gene, but since the transcriptome data for huperzia may not be exhaustive, it is still unclear whether the gene loss event pre-dates lycophyte diversification.

duplication along the ancestral branch to euphyllophytes
the two loci produced by the “tracheophyte duplication” have evolved into three euphyllophyte-wide gene lineages . two of these, group i+ii and iii) share an immediate sister relationship and therefore originated through a duplication event along the ancestral branch of the euphyllophytes . the single euphyllophyte-wide gene lineage in the collective sister group of groups i+ii and iii, group iv , suggests that the above duplication affected only one of the duplicate loci in the euphyllophyte ancestor. a more global duplication event, for example an euphyllophyte whole-genome duplication , is a less parsimonious scenario that requires loss of one group iv lineage, prior to the diversification of extant euphyllophytes.

duplication along ancestral branch to spermatophytes
of the three gsk <dig> loci present in the euphyllophyte ancestor, at least one was subsequently duplicated on the ancestral branch of seed plants, producing four gsk <dig> gene lineages . this duplication event  is unambiguously inferred by the immediate sister relationship between two lineages of seed plant genes, groups i and ii, which are collectively sister to a clade of monilophyte genes . the a <dig> duplication coincides with the proposed wgd in the ancestral lineage of extant seed plants, ~ <dig> ma ago  <cit> , and a synchronous duplication event may have affected the ancestral group iii locus in the seed plant ancestor. the phylogeny of seed plant group iii genes resolves as a single angiosperm lineage  and two gymnosperm lineages  that are paraphyletic with respect to angiosperm iii . gymnosperm iii- <dig> includes representatives of all extant gymnosperm lineages , while gymnosperm iii- <dig> lacks gnetophytes , and is sister to the angiosperm iii gene clade . the gene tree therefore implies a gene duplication event on the branch to extant seed plants with subsequent loss of one descendant lineage along the branch leading to extant angiosperms. this inferred group iii “seed plant duplication” genes would be congruent with that in its sister clade , increasing the likelihood of a wgd influencing both events. however, the third gene lineage inherited by seed plants from the euphyllophyte ancestor, group iv, contains no clear evidence of a seed plant wgd. here, the gene tree resolves as five sequential branches leading to representatives of the ginkgophytes, cycadophytes, pinophytes, gnetophytes, and angiosperms, respectively .

duplication on the ancestral branch to angiosperms
sister angiosperm-wide gene lineages  imply duplication of the ancestral group i locus along the branch to extant flowering plants with retention of both duplicate copies . this duplication coincides with a proposed wgd event that occurred between 300– <dig> mya along the ancestral lineage of angiosperms  <cit> . synchronous “angiosperm” duplications are not obvious for the other angiosperm gsk <dig> gene lineages, but the two amborella genes in the group ii clade may be noteworthy. one occupies the expected position at the base of a pan-angiosperm gene lineage , while the other is placed within a paraphyletic group of gymnosperm genes  . the paraphyly of gymnosperm ii is primarily due to three clades of sequences from conifers, two of which are sister to ginkgo and gnetophyte sequences, respectively. this topology may be an artifact of inadequate sampling of non-conifer genes rather than a representation of the true gene tree. the placement of an amborella gene among gymnosperm ii sequences may also be an artifact of phylogeny reconstruction. otherwise, the gene tree implies that three seed plant clades exist among these group ii genes; one with broad angiosperm and gymnosperm representation, a second represented in amborella and gymnosperms, and the third represented only in conifers. perhaps instead, two angiosperm lineages  originated through a single gene duplication event along the branch to extant angiosperms, followed by loss of the angiosperm ii- <dig> lineage after the separation of amborella from other flowering plants. on the basis of the other  <dig> completely sequenced nuclear genomes in our sample , the angiosperm ii- <dig> gene lineage would have become extinct early in angiosperm evolution, certainly prior to the divergence of monocots and eudicots. the placement of the surviving amborella angiosperm ii- <dig> gene among the gymnosperm ii genes, instead of their sister, could therefore be interpreted as an artifact of phylogeny reconstruction, rather than a reflection of true relationship.

gene family expansion in individual land plant lineages
we have identified seven gsk <dig> genes in the genome sequence of physcomitrella, two more than previously reported  <cit> , indicating a dramatic increase in gene family members over the course of moss evolution. the genome of the lycophyte selaginella contains only two gsk <dig> loci, but a gene loss event may have contributed to this condition . gene duplication and extinction events are also evident during the diversification of individual euphyllophyte lineages.

monilophytes
clades of five equisetum diffusum sequences are present in both groups iv and iii genes , indicating multiple duplications affecting gsk <dig> loci in this species. similarly, multiple clades of asplenium platyneuron, cyathea spinulosa, and onoclea sensibilis sequences in monilophytes i +ii and iii  indicate duplications in these leptosporangiate ferns. these duplication events in gsk <dig> gene lineages are consistent with the widely recognized role of polyploidy in the evolutionary history of monilophyte taxa  <cit> .

gymnosperms
the gymnosperms ginkgo biloba, picea glauca, and welwitschia mirabilis each possess duplicate group iv gsk <dig> genes  likely derived from separate duplication events unique to their respective lineages. relatively recent duplications are evident for the pinaceae in both clades of gymnosperm iii genes . the gymnosperm ii lineage includes three clades of sequences representing conifers , but uncertainty regarding the relationships of these genes relative to other gymnosperm taxa obscures their evolutionary origin. all group i gymnosperm sequences form a clade , with separate duplications in gnetophytes, pinaceae, and zamia vazquezii .

angiosperms
among the angiosperm iv group , duplications in arabidopsis and glycine max coincide with postulated wgd events for these taxa  <cit>  . duplications are also evident in helianthus annuus, perhaps reflecting an ancient wgd in heliantheae  <cit> , and manihot esculenta, which has not been associated with polyploidy. group iv genes have not been found among non-poaceae monocots, possible reflecting a sampling artifact, but their absence in the sequenced genome of a member of the ranunculaceae  and in extensive transcriptome data for eschscholzia californica  indicates a gene loss event early during the diversification of the ranunculales.

similar gene loss events are not apparent in the angiosperm iii gene lineage, and, instead, duplications are prominent . these have occurred in both asterid and rosid taxa , as well as the monocot zea mays, and several coincide with postulated wgd events . as discussed above, one descendant lineage of the group ii “angiosperm” duplication has been almost completely lost but its sister lineage has diversified extensively in angiosperms. in this gene-rich lineage,  <dig> species encode at least  <dig> gsk <dig> genes with duplications coinciding with nine of the  <dig> postulated wgd events, including the core eudicot “hexaploidy” event  . the two subclades of angiosperm i genes have had contrasting evolutionary histories . all major angiosperm lineages are represented in the angiosperm i- <dig> lineage, but the i- <dig> lineage was apparently lost early in the evolution of the monocots. only acorus, the sister group of other monocots, is represented in this lineage. the precise timing of this gene loss remains to be determined, but absence from available sequenced monocot genomes  indicates loss prior to the origin of the poaceae. more globally, the angiosperm i- <dig> lineage has experienced a dramatic expansion in gene copy number relative to angiosperm i- <dig>  and seven duplication events coincide with postulated wgd events during angiosperm diversification . for example, the wgd responsible for the ancestral “hexaploidy” of core eudicots  <cit>  is evident as duplicate clades including vitis vinifera, fabidae, malvidae, lamiideae, and campanulidae. as no such duplications are evident in angiosperm i- <dig>  widespread loss of duplicates must have followed wgd in this gene lineage.

evolution of gsk <dig> gene expression in seed plants
to assess the evolution of gsk <dig> gene expression and, by inference, function, we examined gene expression levels in a functionally diverse set of tissues, including roots, aerial vegetative shoots, and reproductive organs, in six seed plant species . members of most gsk <dig> gene lineages are expressed in almost all tissues examined, supporting their involvement in a wide variety of biological processes. however, these expression data also reveal several instances of tissue preferential expression that suggest roles in specific developmental programs.

of the three arabidopsis genes implicated in floral development, the roles of group i genes, atsk <dig> and atsk <dig>  have been confirmed genetically  <cit> , notably, group i-1genes from aristolochia, liriodendron, persea, and nuphar exhibit floral-preferential expression, suggesting that the floral function of atsk <dig> and atsk <dig>  may be evolutionarily conserved in most angiosperms. the amborella group i- <dig> gene is also expressed in flowers, but appears to be preferentially expressed in roots. similarly, group i genes from zamia are expressed at comparable levels in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. these expression patterns suggest an evolutionary conserved shift to flower preferential expression by group i- <dig> gsk <dig> genes after the divergence of amborella from other angiosperms.

seedling lethality in mutants  <cit>  have obscured the precise function of atsk <dig> . according to the microarray data, atsk <dig> is specifically expressed during the latter stages of floral development, where it is closely associated with pollen development in mature stamens  <cit> . other group iii genes do not exhibit congruent expression patterns. the aristolochia homolog of atsk <dig> is up-regulated in leaves as well as fruits, but all other angiosperm group iii genes, including atsk <dig> , show relatively even expression levels across multiple floral and vegetative tissues. the floral function of atsk <dig> is therefore likely to be an example of neo-functionalization after the duplication event that produced paralogous group iii loci in arabidopsis. approximately two-fold up-regulation of a zamia group iv gene in open female cones and seeds relative to other tissues may represent another example of independent recruitment of a gsk <dig> gene to a role in reproduction; in a gymnosperm in this instance.

CONCLUSIONS
the diversification of the land plant branch of the gsk <dig> gene family has been reconstructed in unprecedented detail by our phylogenetic analyses. four ancient gene duplication events are inferred: in chronological sequence, they occurred along the ancestral branches leading to extant tracheophytes, euphyllophytes, seed plants, and flowering plants, respectively. if these gene duplications were always the result of wgd events, the expected increase in gene lineages was typically countered by loss of at least one descendant lineage. local duplications affecting single ancestral loci could also explain the asymmetric gene tree topology that our phylogenetic analyses reconstruct. however, multiple examples of gene losses soon after duplication are also apparent. for instance, among flowering plants, amborella alone may contain all the gsk <dig> gene lineages descended from duplications along the ancestral branch to extant angiosperms. gene expression data suggest that the group i. <dig> genes have an evolutionarily conserved role in floral development, while members of other gsk <dig> genes lineages have been independently recruited to reproductive roles, for example, a group iii gene in arabidopsis and a group iv gene in zamia.
