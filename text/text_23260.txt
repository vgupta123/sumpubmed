BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent responsible for porcine pleuropneumonia, a contagious and potentially fatal respiratory disease in pigs  <cit> . based on differences in the capsular polysaccharides,  <dig> serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae have been identified to date, which show significant variation with respect to virulence and geographical distribution. most of those serotypes secrete one or more a. pleuropneumoniae toxin , identified as apxi, apxii, apxiii, and apxiv. apx toxins are major virulence factors of a. pleuropneumoniae and are highly immunogenic. it is well accepted that apxi and apxiii are highly toxic for porcine neutrophils and pulmonary alveolar macrophages, and apxii only moderately so.

a. pleuropneumoniae vaccines include inactivated whole-cell bacterins as well as the more promising subunit vaccines and live attenuated vaccines  <cit> . most commercially available vaccines against a. pleuropneumoniae infection comprise inactivated whole-cell bacterins derived from various serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> . however, bacterins confer only partial protection against homologous serotypes and do not usually protect against challenge with heterologous serotypes  <cit> . in addition, a large number of mutants were generated and used to produce live attenuated vaccines  <cit> . however, live attenuated vaccines present a number of bio-safety concerns.

many studies show that subunit vaccines elicit an effective immune response and provide protection against a. pleuropneumoniae infection. apx proteins have been studied as potential candidates for the development of vaccines against porcine pleuropneumoniae because they are highly immunogenic. many commercially available a. pleuropneumoniae subunit vaccines contain recombinant apx proteins  <cit> . in addition, chimeric proteins containing components of apx toxin have been produced for vaccine development. some epitopes of apxia were inserted into the b subunit of e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, and the immunogenicity of the chimeric proteins was analyzed in mice  <cit> . recently, apxiia fused with the cholera toxin b subunit was expressed in corn as a subunit vaccine candidate  <cit> .

mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the etiological agent responsible for porcine enzootic pneumonia, a chronic non-fatal disease that affects pigs of all ages  <cit> . pigs with primary mycoplasmal infection are predisposed to potentially fatal secondary infections by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, pasteurella multocida, and a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> .

commonly used vaccines against m. hyopneumoniae comprise inactivated whole-cell bacterins. although bacterin-based vaccines often reduce the infection level in a herd, protection against clinical pneumonia is usually not complete  <cit> . in an experimental transmission study, a bacterin vaccine reduced the transmission of m. hyopneumoniae only to a limited extent  <cit> . moreover, preparation of bacterin vaccines is not economically advantageous, because in vitro culture of m. hyopneumoniae is time-consuming and requires a rich medium  <cit> .

p <dig> adhesin is highly conserved among different strains of m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . p <dig> is essential for the adherence of m. hyopneumoniae to ciliated respiratory epithelial cells. the c-terminus of p <dig> contains two repeat regions, designated r <dig> and r <dig>  which play key roles in adherence  <cit> . following the discovery of a functional role for the c-terminus of p <dig>  much effort has been made to develop vaccines based on this region, in particular the r <dig> and r <dig> repeats.

a recombinant chimera comprising the r <dig> region of p <dig> and e. coli enterotoxin b induced increased humoral and cellular immune responses in mice when compared with the recombinant r <dig> region alone  <cit> . another chimera comprising the r <dig> region and a domain of pseudomonas exotoxin a stimulated a higher igg response to the r <dig> region than a commercial m. hyopneumoniae vaccine  <cit> .

live bacteria harboring vectors encoding either r <dig>  or r <dig> and r <dig>  have also been evaluated for their potential as vaccines against m. hyopneumoniae infection. mice that orally ingested salmonella typhimurium harboring eukaryotic or prokaryotic expression vector encoding the r <dig> region showed r1-specific th <dig> responses  <cit> . intranasal and oral immunization of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae strains expressing the c-terminal portion of p <dig>  including the r <dig> and r <dig> regions, to pigs reduced the severity of pneumonic lung lesions caused by m. hyopneumoniae infection  <cit> . adenovirus expressing the c-terminal portion of p <dig>  containing the r <dig> and r <dig> regions, also induced protective p97-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in pigs  <cit> .

there is a high demand for multi-disease vaccines in the swine industry due to the high labor costs incurred by vaccination and because of injection-induced stress in pigs. this is particularly true for preventing m. hyopneumoniae infection and/or secondary infection induced by a. pleuropneumoniae <cit> . therefore, the aim of the present study was to produce a chimeric fusion protein comprising the n-terminal portion of apxiii and the c-terminal portion of p <dig> using an e. coli expression system, and to analyze its immunogenicity and protective effects against infection by m. hyopneumoniae and a. pleuropneumoniae.

methods
chemicals
all chemicals were of reagent grade or higher and were obtained from sigma-aldrich , unless otherwise specified.

microbial culture
a. pleuropneumoniae strain  <dig>  and m. hyopneumoniae strain j were purchased from the american type culture collection . a wild-type strain of m. hyopneumoniae was isolated from the lung tissues of pigs suffering from porcine enzootic pneumonia.

the a. pleuropneumoniae strain was cultured in pleuropneumonia-like organism  media  supplemented with 10 μg/ml nicotinamide dinucleotide, 260 μg/ml l-cysteine hydrochloride, 1 mg/ml dextrose, 10 μg/ml l-cysteine dihydrochloride,  <dig>  mm glutamine, and  <dig> % tween  <dig> at 37°c with continuous shaking  <cit> . for whole-cell lysate preparations, a. pleuropneumoniae was cultured to mid-log phase and collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 10 min. the cell pellet was washed with phosphate buffered saline , lysed with lysis buffer ,  <dig>  m nacl,  <dig>  m edta, 1% sds) and stored at -70°c until use.

proteins secreted by a. pleuropneumoniae into the culture media were precipitated by the addition of  <dig> % deoxycholic acid  and 15% trichloroacetic acid  to the supernatant. following overnight incubation at 4°c, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and the pellet was washed with cold ethanol and centrifuged. after aspiration of the supernatant, the pellet was dried and dissolved in pbs.

m. hyopneumoniae strains were cultured to mid-log phase  in atcc medium  <dig> at 37°c with continuous shaking  <cit> . cell membranes were isolated by osmotic lysis and sonication. briefly, the cell pellet was washed with pbs, resuspended in deionized water, and incubated at 37°c for 30 min. the suspensions were disrupted by sonication  and then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 20 min at 4°c. the supernatant was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 1 h at 4°c to collect the cell membranes  <cit> . the cell membrane pellet was dissolved in resuspension buffer ) and stored at -70°c until use.

e. coli dh5α and bl <dig>  strains  were used for plasmid dna amplification and production of recombinant proteins, respectively, and were grown in luria-bertani  media at 37°c with continuous shaking.

recombinant plasmids
to prepare the pet-apxn plasmid vector, a fragment of the apxiiia gene was amplified from a. pleuropneumoniae genomic dna by polymerase chain reaction  using apxn-f and apxn-r primers . the pcr product was cloned into a pgem-t easy vector . the ta-cloned vector was then digested with bamhi and xhoi and the insert was ligated into linearized pet28a  carrying an n-terminal histidine tag to obtain pet-apxn.

the pet-p97c vector was constructed to express a region of the c-terminal portion of p <dig> . first, a dna fragment was synthesized, in which the nucleotide sequence of p <dig> was modified to produce codons preferred by e. coli without changing the amino acid sequence  <cit> , and the 5’-tga-3’ codon was replaced with 5’-tgg-3’ . 5’-tga-3’ is read as tryptophan in mycoplasma, but results in premature termination of translation in other eubacteria, such as e. coli <cit> . the fragment was used to amplify a 954 bp-long product encompassing the r <dig> and r <dig> regions of p <dig> by pcr with p97c-f and p97c-r primers   <cit> . the product was cloned into a pgem-t easy vector. the ta-cloned vector was restricted with bamhi and xhoi, and the insert was ligated into linearized pet28a to form pet-p97c.

the pet-ap <dig> vector was used to express chimeric protein ap <dig>  which comprises apxn and p97c at the n- and c-terminus, respectively. a fragment of the apxiiia gene was amplified from a. pleuropneumoniae genomic dna by pcr using primers ap97-f and ap97-r  and cloned into a pgem-t easy vector. the gly-ser peptide linker within the chimeric protein was encoded by the sequence 5’-ggatcc-3’ within the ap97-r primer, or by a bamhi site. the ta-cloned vector was digested with ndei and bamhi and the insert was ligated into linearized pet-p97c to yield pet-ap <dig>  the 5’-tag-3’ nucleotide sequence for a leu residue was replaced with 5’-cag-3’ in both ap97-r and apxn-r primers .

expression and purification of recombinant proteins
each recombinant vector was transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  using a heat shock protocol. selected colonies were cultured at 37°c in lb media supplemented with 100 μg/ml kanamycin. overnight cultures  were grown until mid-log phase as indicated by an a <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig> , at which point protein expression was induced for 4 h by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm.

both the p97c and ap <dig> proteins were purified from e. coli inclusion bodies. the cells were washed twice with ice-cold pbs  and then lysed for 30 min in buffer a , ph  <dig> ). the lysate was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in buffer b . the solubilized extracts were then loaded onto a ni-nitrilotriacetic acid  column . the column was washed with buffer c  and eluted with buffers d and e  as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

to purify apxn, the cells were washed with ice-cold pbs, lysed in buffer f  on ice for 30 min and sonicated on ice using six 10-s bursts at 200–300 w with a 10-s cooling period between each burst. the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a ni-nta column. the column was washed twice with buffer g . proteins bound to the ni-nta column were eluted with buffer h  as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

purified proteins were dialyzed for 36 h at 4°c with urea or an imidazole solution diluted serially with pbs containing 150 mm sodium chloride and 5% glycerol. protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic protein assay kit .

mice
all procedures for handling the mice used in this study were reviewed and approved by the institute of laboratory animal resources of seoul national university and performed in an ethical and humane manner under veterinary supervision. female balb/c mice aged  <dig> to 8 weeks  were divided into groups of five animals and housed in laboratory animal facilities at the college of veterinary medicine, seoul national university. the mice were kept in cages with access to water and food ad libitum for 2 weeks before the first immunization. the mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of 25 mg/kg zoletil  and 10 mg/kg rompun  and then immunized by subcutaneous administration of 25 μg of immunogen  on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  pbs-immunized mice were included as negative controls. immunogens or pbs were administered in complete freund’s adjuvant on day  <dig> and in incomplete freund’s adjuvant on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  freund’s adjuvants are potent oil-based adjuvants that are commonly used in animal research  <cit> .

serum samples were obtained by retro-orbital bleeding under anesthesia before immunization on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the mice were sacrificed by cardiac puncture 3 weeks after the final immunization , and splenectomies were performed to enable the primary culture of splenocytes.

splenocytes and cytokine analysis
the spleens of mice immunized with ap <dig>  apxn, and p97c vaccines were aseptically removed, and single cell suspensions were prepared by passing the organ through a 200-μm nylon mesh sieve. splenocytes were resuspended in ack buffer , washed twice with rpmi  <dig> media, and cultured in rpmi  <dig> media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine,  <dig> u/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 37°c under 5% co <dig> in a humidified atmosphere. for analysis of cytokine production, splenocytes  were re-stimulated for 72 h with  <dig>  μg/ml of ap <dig>  apxn, or p97c dissolved in pbs. at the end of re-stimulation, cell culture supernatants were harvested and analyzed for ifn-γ and il- <dig> using a bead-based multiplex assay kit , as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
the immuno-reactivity of the mouse serum samples against apxn and p97c was measured using an indirect elisa. in brief, the wells of a 96-well plate were coated with  <dig>  μg of apxn or p97c in 50 μl of carbonate buffer  overnight at 4°c. the wells were washed three times with pbs containing  <dig> % tween  <dig> , blocked with 5% skim milk for 2 h at 37°c, washed with pbs-t, and then incubated with serially diluted serum samples for 2 h at 37°c. the wells were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg, igg <dig>  or igg2a  for 1 h at 37°c. after washing, the color was developed with o-phenylenediamine  and 3 m hcl was used to stop the reaction. the absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a micro-plate spectrophotometer . the cut-off values for the assay were calculated as the mean specific optical density  plus three standard deviations  using serum samples of non-immunized mice  assayed at a 1: <dig> dilution. titers were established as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution yielding an od higher than the cut-off.

gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis
protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  using a minigel apparatus  and stained with coomassie blue. for western blot analysis, the proteins in the sds-page gels were transferred to a protran nitrocellulose membrane  in a blotting apparatus . the blots were blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk for 1 h and then incubated with antisera from mice or pigs  overnight at 4°c. the blots were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg or anti-pig igg  secondary antibodies  for 1 h and developed with chemiluminescence reagents .

pigs
ten 3-week-old male pigs weighing 4–6 kg were obtained from a pathogen-free farm. pigs were randomly divided into two groups, housed in pens with slatted floors and rubber mats in separate rooms, and provided with water and food ad libitum. pigs were shown to be free of pathogens by pcr analysis of nasal swabs. a 500-bp fragment of the gene encoding a capsular polysaccharide from a. pleuropneumoniae serotype  <dig> was amplified using the appcps-f and appcps-r primers , and a 137-bp fragment of the p <dig> gene from m. hyopneumoniae was amplified using the mhyop102-f and mhyop102-r primers.

after a week of acclimatization, both groups of pigs was immunized intramuscularly with either 700 μg of ap <dig> adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide, a standard adjuvant in clinical veterinary vaccines  <cit> , or 2 ml pbs containing aluminum hydroxide as the negative control . a booster was inoculated on day  <dig> in a similar manner. blood samples for immuno-serological analysis were drawn by puncture of the vena cava cranialis on day  <dig> after the first immunization, and serum was obtained by centrifugation for 15 min at  <dig>  × g. in challenge treatments performed following blood collection, pigs were inoculated with 7 ml culture media containing 2 ×  <dig> colony-forming units of a. pleuropneumoniae and  <dig>  ×  <dig> color-changing units of m. hyopneumoniae by intranasal and intratracheal administration, respectively. clinical signs such as rectal temperature, coughing, dyspenia, tachypnea, depression, and nasal discharge were monitored and recorded 2 weeks after challenge . pigs were euthanized using electric current and complete necroscopies were performed 21 days after challenge . the macroscopic lung lesion score was determined as described previously  <cit> .

statistics
statistical analyses were performed using spss  <dig>  . data were expressed as the mean ± sd. the unpaired student’s t-test was used to compare antibody titers and macroscopic lung lesion scores. the paired student’s t-test was used to evaluate differences in cytokine production. data were considered significantly different when p was <  <dig> .

RESULTS
production of recombinant proteins
sds-page analysis of proteins purified after expression in e. coli using pet-apxn, pet-p97c, and pet-ap <dig> vectors revealed prominent bands at approximately 15 kda, 45 kda, and 60 kda, respectively . these values corresponded to the expected molecular weights of apxn, p97c, and ap <dig> . these findings demonstrate that the recombinant proteins were expressed as expected.

immunogenicity of recombinant proteins in mice
antiserum generated in mice immunized with the ap <dig> vaccine was used to test the ability of the chimeric protein to induce the production of antibodies specific for each of its component subunits, apxn and p97c, as well as to the whole chimeric protein . antiserum against the ap <dig> vaccine reacted well with apxn, p97c, and ap <dig>  demonstrating that immunization with ap <dig> induces the production of antibodies that bind to all three recombinant proteins. thus, ap <dig> retained the antigenic characteristics of its two individual components. antisera from mice immunized with the apxn and p97c vaccines reacted with ap <dig>  and with apxn and p97c, respectively; however, antisera from mice immunized with apxn did not cross react with p97c and vice versa .

immunization with the ap <dig> and apxn vaccines induced vigorous igg responses to apxn in mice. the igg log titers reached  <dig>  and  <dig>  on day  <dig> after the first immunization, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  at 3 weeks after the last immunization  with ap <dig> and apxn, respectively, which were significantly higher than those recorded for antisera obtained from mice given pbs . immunization with the ap <dig> and p97c vaccines also increased the levels of anti-p97c igg antibodies in the mice, with log titers reaching  <dig>  and  <dig>  at 3 weeks after the last immunization , respectively; these values are also higher than those for the antisera obtained from mice given pbs .

the levels of both the igg <dig> and igg2a isotypes against apxn and p97c were measured in sera collected 3 weeks after the last immunization . the levels of both isotypes against apxn and p97c were higher than those in the corresponding pbs-treated controls , indicating mixed th1-th <dig> responses. however, the mean ratios of igg2a/igg <dig> against apxn were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in antisera from mice given the ap <dig> and apxn vaccines, respectively, indicating the predominance of igg2a production over igg <dig> and, thus, a th1-biased response to apxn. by contrast, the igg2a/igg <dig> ratios to p97c were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the antisera from mice given the ap <dig> and p97c vaccines, respectively. this demonstrates that ap <dig> and p97c induced relatively balanced igg2a and igg <dig> responses to p97c.

cytokine secretion induced by recombinant proteins
re-stimulated splenic mononuclear cells  from mice immunized with ap <dig>  apxn, and p97c vaccines were assayed for the production of the ifn-γ and il- <dig> . the concentrations of ifn-γ, a th <dig> cytokine, in the culture medium of splenocytes re-stimulated in vitro with ap <dig>  apxn, and p97c were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, respectively. those levels were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times higher, respectively, than those re-stimulated with pbs  . the concentrations of il- <dig>  a th <dig> cytokine, produced by splenocytes re-stimulated in vitro with ap <dig>  apxn, and p97c were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml, respectively. those levels were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher, respectively, than those in the pbs controls . stimulation with concanavalin a, a potent t cell stimulator, also induced splenocytes  to produce these two cytokines . these findings indicate that all three recombinant proteins triggered the production of both ifn-γ and il- <dig> by splenocytes, suggesting the induction of mixed th1-th <dig> immune responses.

reaction of apxiii and p <dig> with mouse antisera to the recombinant proteins
western blots were performed to examine the reaction of native apxiii with mouse antisera raised against the ap <dig> and apxn vaccines . a protein sample precipitated from the culture medium of a. pleuropneumoniae was used for the analysis . antisera generated in mice immunized with the apxn and ap <dig> vaccines reacted with a precipitated protein that was approximately 120 kda in size, which corresponds to the molecular weight of apxiii  <cit> , whereas no protein signal was detected in the control media, indicating that the antibodies generated in response to vaccination with ap <dig> and apxn readily bind to the apxiii excreted by a. pleuropneumoniae. these data suggest that ap <dig>  as well as apxn, possess the antigenic characteristics of the apxiii protein, which are recognized by the mouse immune system.

antisera from mice immunized with the ap <dig> and p97c vaccines were also assayed for reaction with p <dig>  found in the membrane fraction of m. hyopneumoniae . the antisera detected bands of approximately  <dig> kda, the predicted size of p <dig>  these data suggest that both ap <dig> and p97c retain the antigenic characteristics of native p <dig>  in addition, serum from a pig artificially infected with m. hyopneumoniae reacted with the 97 kda protein. all three antisera also reacted with two other proteins , and the pig antiserum detected an additional band at 70 kda. these protein bands, including p <dig>  were not recognized by the control serum.

immunogenicity of ap <dig> in pigs
we also assessed the reactivity of ap <dig> vaccine-treated pig serum against native p <dig> and apxiii . antiserum to the ap <dig> vaccine recognized protein bands of the expected molecular masses; 97 kda in the cell membrane fraction of m. hyopneumoniae and 120 kda in the culture media and cell lysate of a. pleuropneumoniae. the data are representative of six experiments, in which independent antiserum samples were used. in addition, the serum from pigs treated with pbs did not react with p <dig> or apxiii. these data suggest that antibodies induced in pigs vaccinated with ap <dig> efficiently react with p <dig> and apxiii, and that both domains of the ap <dig> protein are immunogenic in pigs.

protective efficacy of ap <dig> in pigs
since pigs immunized with ap <dig> produced antibodies against p <dig> and apxiii , the pigs were directly subjected to challenge with m. hyopneumoniae and a. pleuropneumoniae. the pbs vaccine-treated control pigs that were challenged with a. pleuropneumoniae and m. hyopneumoniae showed an increased body temperature and developed clinical symptoms, including coughing, dyspnea, depression, and nasal discharge . postmortem examination revealed that all the pbs-immunized pigs had numerous gross pathological changes linked to a. pleuropneumoniae and m. hyopneumoniae . the lungs of the pbs-vaccinated pigs developed well-demarcated dark red areas of cranioventral consolidation, which are lesions consistent with mycoplasmal pneumonia, and also developed multifocal hemorrhages and fibrinous pleurisy that are classic presentation of a. pleuropneumoniae disease  <cit> . in contrast, no remarkable clinical signs or lung lesions were observed in the ap97-vaccinated group .

discussion
there is a high demand for multi-disease and multivalent vaccines in the animal health industry. however, combining vaccine antigens causes a variety of problems, including interference between the various components, antigenic competition, and carrier-specific epitope suppression  <cit> . thus, combined formulations must be shown to be both safe and effective before licensure. numerous examples of immunological interference have been observed in laboratory tests and clinical trials  <cit> . one relevant example involves a study of immunity against a. pleuropneumoniae in swine, in which the protective efficacy of an apxi/apxii vaccine was lost when it was supplemented with pala, an outer membrane protein derived from the pathogen  <cit> .

the first  <dig> residues of the apxiii n-terminus are involved in its cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic activity, and convalescent serum collected from a pig infected with a. pleuropneumoniae reacted with the n-terminus  <cit> . based upon these findings, the region encompassing residues 21– <dig> of apxiii was used to construct ap <dig>  in preliminary studies, the first  <dig> residues of apxiii were also included, but the expression efficiency was very low . this could be due to the inclusion of two under-represented arg codons  at residues  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in e. coli, aua , cua , and aga, agg, or cga , represent less than 8% of their corresponding population of codons  <cit> . another rarely-observed codon, cua, at residue  <dig> of apxiii was replaced with cug using an ap97-r primer that contains a single base substitution . this was also the case for the expression of apxn.

the expression of recombinant proteins, especially chimeric proteins, can result in aberrant tertiary folding of the expressed protein; correct folding is critical for maintaining the antigenic characteristics. it was not established whether or not both components of ap <dig> protein possessed the correct tertiary structure. however, ap <dig> retained the antigenic properties of its two component proteins, apxn and p97c , and antisera from mice and pigs immunized with ap <dig> readily reacted with native apxiii and p <dig> from a. pleuropneumoniae and m. hyopneumoniae, respectively . in addition, immunization with the ap <dig> vaccine induced humoral and cellular immune responses in mice , and pigs immunized with the ap <dig> vaccine were protected against challenge by a. pleuropneumoniae and m. hyopneumoniae . these findings suggest that ap <dig> contains antigenic epitopes similar to those of native apxiii and p <dig> 

il- <dig> activates b cells and induces class switching to the igg <dig> isotype , while ifn-γ induces igg2a responses   <cit> . a th <dig> antibody response is involved in protection from infection, while a th <dig> response is helpful for clearing the infection. thus, an ideal vaccine should enhance th <dig> responses while concomitantly maintaining th <dig> responses. ap <dig> induced secretion of both th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines by splenocytes . along with an increase in cytokine levels, the levels of both the igg <dig> and igg2a isotypes specific for apxn and p97c were also increased in the sera of ap97-immunized mice . these indicate that ap <dig> induced a mixed th1-th <dig> response. p97c induced balanced igg <dig> and igg <dig> responses in mice . by contrast, apxn induced igg2a more than igg <dig>  indicating a th1-biased response to apxn. this difference in the responses elicited by the two components of ap <dig> is interesting; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. previous studies indicate that the pattern of igg isotypes induced by protein vaccines depends on the adjuvants and protein antigens used  <cit> .

of the three recombinant proteins, ap <dig> induced the greatest concentrations of ifn-γ and il- <dig> in the culture media of re-stimulated splenocytes . notably, the concentration of ifn-γ in the media from ap97-stimulated cells was a bit higher than the sum of the cytokine concentrations in the media from apxn and p97c-stimulated cells. this was also the case for il- <dig>  these suggest that both components of ap <dig> do not interfere each other on cytokine induction.

the membrane fraction of m. hyopneumoniae contained not only p <dig> but different-sized proteins, which were recognized by serum from a pig artificially infected with m. hyopneumoniae as well as antisera from mice immunized with the ap <dig> and p97c vaccines . based on previous studies that identified different-sized cleavage products of p <dig>  the non-97 kda proteins may represent cleavage products of p <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the chimeric protein, ap <dig>  was both immunogenic and effective as a vaccine under the conditions of these experiments. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the prevention of infection by a. pleuropneumoniae and m. hyopneumoniae using a multi-disease subunit vaccine. the only previous report related to multi-disease vaccination against these two pathogens was based on immunization with a live attenuated strain of a. pleuropneumoniae, which was engineered to express m. hyopneumoniae p <dig>  <cit> . while the results of this study are limited to two proteins derived from these pathogens, it will be interesting to evaluate the potential of other proteins derived from these microorganisms, especially apxi, apxii, and apxiv toxins from various a. pleuropneumoniae serotypes, to contribute to the development of safer and more effective multi-disease vaccines.
