BACKGROUND
mastitis is reported as one of the most important diseases for dairy cattle on the basis of great economical losses caused by affecting animal welfare and milk production costs  <cit> . staphylococcus aureus is one of the major cause of intra-mammary infection  in ruminants worldwide, causing mastitis with diverse degrees of severity. in dairy cows, staph. aureus imi is almost always subclinical, thus leading to an increasing risk of contagion and diffusion in the herds  <cit> . the molecular pattern of staph. aureus isolates in diverse farm animal forms distinct genetic clusters differing in the presence of pathogenic factors that increase their invasiveness, even in the presence of a stronger inflammatory response  <cit> . in a recent study  <cit> , subtypes of staph. aureus were associated with high within-herd imi, compared to other different subtypes that were associated with low within-herd prevalence. this study and previous data  <cit>  confirmed that particular gene patterns, virulence profiles and specific genotypes could be associated with diverse clinical outcomes. more recently, two large european studies  <cit> , demonstrated that the repetitive-sequence pcr rs-pcr genotype b , belonging to the sequence type st <dig>  <cit> , a high contagious and diffusive staph. aureus involved in bovine imi, was the most frequently detected in several european countries . conversely, the rs-pcr genotype s , belonging to st <dig>  <cit> , was one of the rare genotypes found in bovine milk samples. the st <dig> was previously found in both human and dairy cow mastitis  <cit> , suggesting that, after a human-to-cow host jump, a new bovine adaptation took place. at the same time, the st <dig> showed a host transition from human to animal reservoir, becoming the most widely disseminated clonal complex in bovine species and in the milk samples collected in herds with low prevalence of imi .

the existence of subtypes of staph. aureus differing in pathogenic properties emphasizes the need to well define strain characteristics, in order to monitor bacteria dissemination and find potential relevant targets related to their contagiousness. in recent years the advent of next generation sequencing  technologies has improved the estimate of the correlation of virulence phenotype to genome structure, providing a more detailed picture of gene patterns involved into staphylococcal pathogenesis. high-throughput whole-genome sequencing of staph. aureus was prevalently used to monitor outbreaks in hospitals  <cit> , to evaluate strains transitioning from carrier to invasive status  <cit>  and to understand aspects of pathogen biology in detailed epidemiological studies in human . in livestock community, the molecular basis of virulence in staph. aureus mastitis was investigated by using an integrated approach that includes ngs, microarray and proteomic data  <cit>  providing the first high-resolution comparison between gene content and gene expression in two staph. aureus strains. more recently, peton and co-workers  <cit>  described a fine-tuned characterization of staph. aureus newbond  <dig>  a strain belonging to st <dig> and associated to bovine mastitis, by genomic and proteomic comparison with the reference strain rf <dig>  gene expression analysis by microarray techniques has provided, also, information about global transcript changes  <cit>  or molecular basis of virulence  <cit>  in staph. aureus. moreover, rna-seq was recently used to study  the gene expression in different staph. aureus strains  <cit> ,  the role of anti-sense transcription  <cit>  and  the identification of small non-coding rnas  <cit> .

to gain further insight into staph. aureus features, the aim of this work was the characterization of two groups of staph. aureus strains differing in their clinical outcome. each strain was comprehensively studied by comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis in order to identify staphylococcal factors that can be associated with strain virulence and bacterial diffusion in the herd.

methods
bacterial strains
six bacterial strains, originally isolated from subclinical cases of bovine imi in six different holstein herds  located in lombardy region in the northern of italy, were used in this study. the average size of the herds was  <dig> milking cows . milk samples were collected aseptically. samples were kept at 4 °c and bacteriological assays were performed within 48 h. isolates were classified into two groups: staph. aureus belonging to low within-herd mastitis prevalence  or high within-herd mastitis prevalence . as described in table  <dig>  and reported by cremonesi and colleagues  <cit> , staph. aureus isolates had been previously characterized by rs-pcr, multi locus sequence type   <cit> , for presence of meca gene and for different virulence genes. the strains collected in three different herds with low mastitis prevalence  were identified by rs-pcr as genotype s  and by mlst as st <dig> . two out of three were positive for meca gene. the strains isolated from three herds with high imi prevalence  were identified by rs-pcr as genotype b  and st <dig>  and none of them harboured the meca gene coding for methicillin resistance.table  <dig> characteristics of the bacterial strains used in this study

RESULTS
in this study six strains of staph. aureus previously described  <cit>  as strictly associated with high and low within-herd imi prevalence, respectively, were analysed in order to discover, thanks to comparative genomics and transcriptomics, potential pathogenic factors associated with the different clinical outcome found in the herds.

sequencing of gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig> genotypes
genome assembly and comparative genomics
genomic diversity between the staph. aureus gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig> genotypes was assessed analyzing three dna samples for each genotype that were deeply sequenced with an average production of  <dig> , <dig>  reads per sample. the sequencing reads from every sample were assembled obtaining an average of  <dig> number of large contigs  from all the samples  .

three gtb/st <dig> and three gts/st <dig> assemblies showed a high level of within group similarity, ranging from  <dig> to 99% and  <dig> to 98% respectively, whereas only a partial similarity  was observed between the two groups .fig.  <dig>

to create a single reference genome representing each group, all the single genotype-specific assemblies were merged together producing two reference assemblies, one for gtb/st <dig> and one for gts/st <dig> with  <dig>  and  <dig>  large contigs, respectively. these reference assembly genomes, named gtb/st8ra and gts/st398ra, respectively, were used for the genomic analysis in comparison with the genomes of other  <dig> staph. aureus reference strains, fully sequenced and available in genbank . the two genotypes gts/st398ra and gtb/st8ra here analysed clustered better with the staph. aureus st <dig> prototype and staph. aureus tch <dig>  respectively, the latter being a human st <dig> reference strain.

gtb/st8ra and gts/st398ra genome comparison
two thousand six hundred sixty-seven and  <dig> coding dna sequences  were annotated from the prediction tool for gtb/st8ra and gts/st398ra, respectively. predicted proteins were functionally categorized using the cogs database. as expected, about 50% were annotated with a functional role . protein homology analysis revealed that the majority of cdss  was shared between the two groups of strains, since up to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the cdss belonged to the core genome of gtb/st8ra and gts/st398ra, respectively . the cogs distributions were similar in the two genomes: both gt8/st8ra and gts/st398ra presented a set of unique genes belonging to “phages, prophages, transposable elements, plasmids” and “virulence, disease and defence” categories that were significantly enriched  compared to the core genome. in addition, gtb/st8ra was significantly enriched also in “membrane transport” genes . for both groups of strains, unique genes associated to virulence were prevalently attributed to “adhesion function” and “resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds and toxin production” .fig.  <dig> gene ontology  categories comparison between annotated genes belonging to the core genome  and unique gene for gtb/st8ra  and gts/st398ra . x axis indicates the percentage value of genes belonging to each categories reported

gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig> transcriptomic comparison
transcriptomic analysis and qrt-pcr validation
rna-seq data covering the staph. aureus genome were used to quantitatively compare gene expression levels between the two groups of strains grown in the exponential phase. transcriptome reads were aligned against staph. aureus nctc <dig> reference genome with an high read-mapping rate and high coverage for both genotypes  . among the  <dig> genes that were in common between the three genomes ,  <dig> differential expressed genes  were found between the two groups with a distribution of  <dig> % of the degs up-regulated in gtb/st <dig> strains and  <dig> % in gts/st <dig> strains .

four of these differentially expressed genes were validated by rt-pcr: saouhsc_ <dig>  the lys
m domain-containing protein; saouhsc_ <dig> an hypothetical proteins; saouhsc_ <dig>  dna-binding response regulator; saouhsc_01450the basic amino acid/polyamine antiporter, apa family protein. for each test, qpcr results confirmed rna-seq data: saouhsc_ <dig> not expressed in one of the two genotypes resulted in undetermined ct value, whereas the three differentially expressed genes saouhsc_ <dig>  saouhsc_ <dig>  saouhsc_ <dig> showed fold changes of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in qpcr respectively, comparable with the fold changes of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  obtained from rna-seq .

functional analysis of transcriptomic data
the comparison between the number of degs and the total number of genes present in the nctc <dig> reference genome, revealed that genes belonging to “amino acid transport and metabolism” category varied significantly between the two genotypes . other two categories, “defence mechanism” and “inorganic ion transport and metabolism” indicated a trend toward enrichment in degs list .fig.  <dig> gene ontology  categories comparison between significant degs  and genes expressed in the staph. aureus nctc_ <dig> strain . ****p ≤ 1e-4




within the  <dig> annotated genes related to “aminoacid transport and metabolism” pathway, only  <dig> were up-regulated in gtb/st <dig> . concerning “defence mechanism” we found  <dig> annotated genes, within  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated in gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig>  respectively. finally, among the  <dig> degs belonging to “inorganic ion transport and metabolism”,  <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated in gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig>  respectively .table  <dig> degs between gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig> strains

for each locus tag, function: 1) amino acid transport and metabolism, 2) defence mechanisms, and 3) inorganic ion transport and metabolism; protein description, p-value adjusted , log2foldchange  and  up and  down-regulation were reported




virulence and defence pathways analysis: comparison between genomic and transcriptomic data
functional and pathway enrichment analysis for integrated regulatory network of the two groups of strains was performed considering annotated genes from dna-seq and rna-seq experiments, grouped in the three dataset, i.e. gene exclusively present in gtb/st8ra, gene exclusively present in gts/st398ra and degs .

considering the functional categories belonging to bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and infection pathways, we found genes that were detected by using or  strain genotyping comparison or  transcriptomic analysis or  by the two combined approaches, as reported in fig.  <dig>  for example, from this analysis fibronectin-binding protein b gene , an important adhesin involved not only in adhesion to cells but also in internalization by cells, was detected in both groups by means of a partial alignment between gtb/st8ra and gts/st398ra protein sequence. in parallel, transcriptomic analysis revealed a variation in fnbb expression, over-expressed in gtb/st <dig> and down regulated in gts/st <dig> . the nucleotide sequence between the two groups of strains was verified by sequencing a 1285 bp portion of fnbb gene . the nucleotide sequence was conserved within each group of strains and was high polymorphic between the two genotypes. overall, gts/st <dig> showed a high polymorphism compared to reference nctc <dig> strain sequence , whereas no differences were observed for gtb/st <dig> . further, the protein translation for gts/st <dig> resulted in a truncated protein form.fig.  <dig> bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and infection pathways analysis of staph. aureus. in grey highlighted degs or unique genes for gtb/st8ra or gts/st398ra. fibronectin-binding protein b fnbpb, clumping factor b clfb, iron-regulated surface determinant protein a isda, serine-aspartate repeat-containing protein c/d/e sdrc/d/e, staphylococcal complement inhibitor  and eap/map protein eap/map and leukocidin/hemolysin hlg/luc. numbers define the dataset from which the genes were found: 1) unique gtb/st8ra, 2) unique gts/st398ra and 3) degs from transcriptomic analysis, and their combination: 




moreover as shown in fig.  <dig>  clumping factor b gene  and iron-regulated surface determinant protein a gene  showed differentially expression by transcriptomic profiling  . furthermore, the serine-aspartate repeat-containing protein c/d/e gene  and eap/map protein gene  differed in protein sequence exclusively by dnaseq comparison . finally leukocidin/hemolysin gene  was seen to be exclusively present and expressed in the gtb/st <dig> strains, whereas the staphylococcal complement inhibitor scin  was differentially expressed between the two groups, over-expressed in gtb/st <dig> and down-regulated in gts/st <dig> 

discussion

staph. aureus imi clinical outcomes are highly variable and depend on several factors, including animal genetics, environmental conditions and strain-dependent factors. all these conditions should be correctly evaluated in order to predict the spread of bacterial strains within the herd. here we achieved an in-depth characterization through ngs of six staph. aureus strains previously genotyped as gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig>  differing in virulence properties such as within-herd staph. aureus imi prevalence  <cit> .

these six strains belonged to two distinct clonal complexes and sequence types , with a high intra-group similarity among the three strains associated to the same clonal complex , significantly supporting the creation of the reference assemblies as representative of these two lineages. both genotypes clusterized in groups that include strains of human origin: gts/st <dig> showed high similarity with the prototype of staph. aureus st <dig>  so <dig>  isolated from human endocarditis  <cit> , whereas gtb/st <dig> to staph. aureus tch <dig>  a methicillin susceptible st <dig> strain, isolated from an adolescent patient with severe sepsis syndrome  <cit> . recent studies on these ccs  <cit>  showed a closed genetic relationship between cc <dig> isolated from dairy cow mastitis and human cc <dig>  suggesting human-to-bovine jump. on the other hand, the presence of cc <dig> strains was described only in herds with imi prevalence lower than 5%  <cit> . in the present study, a comparison of the genome sequences of these strains with a core genome  revealed about 17% of differences for their gene content, with a relevant enrichment in genes associated with virulence properties. both groups of strains showed differences in several genes associated to virulence factors and some of them were present in only one of the two genotypes.

furthermore, the transcriptomic profiling for both groups of strains confirmed the functional enrichment for genes related to adaptation and propensity to chronicity. interestingly, gtb/st8ra showed higher expression of signal transduction target of rnaiii-activating protein trap, that leads to the activation of agr system, resulting in the expression of several virulence factors. as previously described  <cit> , the protein trap activates rnaiii synthesis by rnaiii-activating protein  system, increasing the pathogenic potential of the bacteria.

contemporary, the integrated pathway analysis between the two genotypes of staph. aureus genes involved in pathogenicity showed an interesting variation in the microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecule , whose function includes adhesion to and invasion in host cells and tissues, evasion of immune responses and biofilm formation  <cit> . as well known, the fnbb gene is a multifunctional mscramm, which recognizes fibronectin, fibrinogen and elastin and promoting the internalization of staph. aureus into epithelial and endothelial cell mediating bacterial invasion  <cit> . most staph. aureus strains can express two distinct fibronectin-binding proteins , which both mediate adhesion to fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin. the gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig> strains, analysed in this study, presented the two fibronectin-binding proteins but only fnbb showed changes in genomic and transcriptomic analyses between these two groups. the fnbb gene showed high variability between the two genotypes, revealing a high level of polymorphisms that lead to a premature stop codon and a truncated form of the protein for gts/st <dig> strains. similar results were previously published by mccarthy and colleagues  <cit> , which postulated that the truncated fnbpb form could affect staph. aureus colonisation and infection. also burke and co-workers found different fnbpb isotypes in diverse sts staph. aureus strains, revealing an association between this gene and the invasiveness  <cit> . and more, the presence of protein variations for both groups of strains suggests a different affinity for fibronectin, necessary for the internalization of staph. aureus into host cells  <cit> .

in addition, clfb and sdrc/d/e genes encoding for mscramms proteins, whose functions are related to adhesion and colonization  <cit> , showed differences by transcriptomic and genomic analyses in both genotypes, respectively, indicating that surface adhesins are not only present/absent, but also variable amongst lineages of staph. aureus  <cit> , such as gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig>  polymorphisms in these genes are well known and used to multilocus variable number tandem repeat fingerprinting , a genotyping method for epidemiological studies  <cit> . other multi-functional proteins, such as the “staph. aureus surface g sas g protein the iron-dependent adhesion isda, isdb, isdc”, over-expressed in gts/st <dig>  play a role in biofilm formation  <cit> . the adhesive properties displayed by mscramm proteins reside within the cell surface; however, several important adhesins are also formally secreted from the bacterial cell. the “secreted expanded repertoire adhesive molecules  extracellular adherence protein”  is nearly ubiquitously distributed amongst staph. aureus strains and appears to function as a virulence determinant in animal models of chronic infection  <cit> . eap gene was proposed as novel target for specific identification of staph. aureus  <cit> . according to our results the sequence alignment of eap gene from all staph. aureus genomes published to date revealed a significant polymorphism in this gene  <cit> . as stated by mccarthy et al.  <cit> , the genetic variation in staph. aureus surface and immune evasion genes is lineage associated and carries a range of unique variants in order to improve the adaptation of this microorganism to different host species.

finally, the staphylococcal complement inhibitor , over-expressed in gtb/st <dig> and down-regulated in gts/st <dig>  produced by the staph. aureus during the early phase of infection, helped the microorganism to survive into the host  <cit> , preventing both chemotaxis and phagocytosis. the fact that surface and immune evasion proteins are different between lineages suggests that they are essential for virulence, opening a window for further investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our analysis proves that integration of rna-seq and dna-seq data well depicts staph. aureus strains associated with different within-herd imi prevalence in dairy cows. our results disclosed congruent patterns of genetic variation in colonization and invasion factors between gtb/st <dig> and gts/st <dig> strains. notwithstanding, results highlight a high number of unknown genes differing between genotypes, whose unknown functionality lacks a direct association with virulence function. overall, the fine genomic characterization of these strains was a first step towards developing strategies able to provide new insights into mechanisms associated to staph. aureus mastitis, including genomic comparison of a larger set of high and low diffusive strains, improvement of staph. aureus reference strains annotation and new ad hoc bioinformatic tools.
