BACKGROUND
arsenic is a carcinogen that causes lung cancer as well as skin, bladder and kidney cancers  <cit> . at  <dig> μg/liter, the cancer risk to people caused by arsenic has been estimated to be between  <dig> to  <dig> per  <dig>  people  <cit> . the identification of the chemical species that are active toxicants and the mode of toxicity are both important components for accurately determining the full breadth of arsenic exposure.

several mechanisms for arsenic-induced carcinogenesis have been proposed including genetic and epigenetic changes, inhibition of dna repair, oxidative stress, alterations in cell death and proliferation, and aberrant activation of signal transduction pathways  <cit> . exposure of tm <dig> testicular leydig cells to arsenic results in the changes in dna methylation and mutations as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> . arsenic exposure reduces dna repair probably by inhibiting dna repair proteins such as excision repair cross-complement  <dig>  and zinc fingers dna repair proteins  <cit> . arsenic also alters cell-cycle related genes including cyclin d <dig>  and cdc25a, and thus cell proliferation  <cit> .

arsenic-related gene expression studies have been performed in several different cell types  <cit> . interestingly, genes involved with cellular respiration have been consistently identified in these expression studies. the addition of arsenite to human keratinocytes has been shown to lead to an increase in thioredoxin reductase , a selenocysteine isomer involved in many cellular redox processes that is often up-regulated in cancers  <cit> . the same study reported that glutathione peroxidase , which protects against reactive oxygen species , was reduced in expression upon the arsenic exposure  <cit> . this implies that arsenic exposure not only promotes the production of ros but also reduces the cell's ability to defend against ros. this is a notable concept, considering that ros have long been known to contribute to carcinogenesis  <cit> .

arsenic activates all mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathways, including the extracellular signal regulated protein kinase , c-jun n-terminal kinase  and p <dig> kinase  <cit> . mapk pathways are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. erk activation by arsenic results in cell proliferation while jnk activation induces apoptosis. arsenic likely activates these pathways via tyrosine kinase receptors such as the egf receptor. in addition to activating kinases, arsenic is also known to regulate transcription factors including ap- <dig>  <cit>  and nfkb  <cit> . these findings strongly suggest that arsenic is involved in the disturbance of the regulation of these pathways, which may lead to cancer.

we hypothesized that arsenic alters gene expression in the lung and that the alterations lead to carcinogenesis by direct and indirect means. we examined global gene expression in an arsenic-treated rat lung epithelial cell line  using an in-house  <dig> k rat dna microarray. the microarray data was confirmed using real-time pcr analysis of selected up- or down-regulated genes. taken together, this study provides a valuable baseboard for the future study of arsenic-induced cell transformation.

RESULTS
cell viability after arsenic exposure
we first determined the viability of the l <dig> cells treated with arsenic in order to optimize our further experiments. when grown to  <dig> to 90% confluence, the cells were treated for  <dig> days with sodium arsenite with . the cell viability was significantly reduced at > <dig> μm of arsenite as determined by the mtt assay . based on the results, we chose the following conditions for microarray experiments:  <dig>  μm for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days.

microarray data analysis following arsenic exposure
we treated l <dig> cells with  <dig>  μm of arsenite for the assigned time periods and subsequently performed dna microarray analysis of  <dig> k genes in order to determine changes in the gene expression that may be cancer-related. the samples were arranged for hybridization using a loop design . for each paired sample, dye flip was used to overcome the difference between two fluorescent dyes . there were a total of  <dig> hybridizations .  <dig> genes  passed the statistical analysis of microarray  test  . of them,  <dig> genes had a fold change of ≥  <dig> between at least two time points. these genes would be the starting point for our study of possible carcinogenic pathways.

cluster analysis and major functional categories
following identification, we used k-means cluster analysis to cluster the  <dig> genes into 2– <dig> nodes. we found that  <dig> nodes or  <dig> clusters best represented their patterns of expression . of these genes,  <dig> were annotated by gene ontology  <cit> , which described the genes in terms of their biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions in a species-independent manner. the functions of the clusters included: cell adhesion, metabolism, development, response to injury, transport, cell motility, glycolysis, cell differentiation, cell cycle, signaling, regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, proteolysis and peptidolysis .

cluster  <dig>  decreased in expression on day  <dig> and increased on day  <dig> and then declined in expression on days  <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> is composed largely of cellular response and development. cluster  <dig>  increased in expression on day  <dig> and declined fairly steadily thereafter. cluster  <dig> involves regulation of transcription, signaling, transport and response to cellular injury. cluster  <dig>  tended to gradually increase in expression continuously from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  cluster  <dig>  had high expression on days  <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> is composed of a fairly even mixture of the functional categories stated. cluster  <dig>  steadily decreased in expression from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  fold changes in each cluster were lower than  <dig> . this is because the values were the averages of all genes in each cluster. of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in clusters 1– <dig>  only  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> genes in clusters 1– <dig> had a fold change of ≥  <dig> between two time points. the temporal differences in the expression of these gene clusters provide a clue as to how these genes may participate in the process of arsenic-mediated cell toxicity.

real-time pcr confirmation
based on the gene ontology analysis, we selected  <dig> genes with at least one gene being selected from each of the  <dig> clusters for real-time pcr verification. four genes, aldose reductase-like protein, matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> and  <dig>  and alanyl membrane aminopeptidase, had little association with the microarray and were disregarded from further investigation. for the rest of the genes, alkaline phosphodiesterase , glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein b , inhibitor of dna binding  <dig> , lactate dehydrogenase a , cytochrome c oxidase  <dig> a <dig> , phosphoglycerate kinase , triosephosphate isomerase  <dig> , 69% of the log <dig> ratios from the real-time pcr showed similar trends with the microarray data based on log <dig> ratio being positive or negative even though absolute changes varied . differences in the results may be due to the difference between the two methods. of these  <dig> genes, three  were from cluster  <dig> whose functional category is comprised largely of glycolysis. two  were from cluster  <dig> whose functional category primarily includes response, proteolysis and peptidolysis. the remaining two, id <dig> and gpnmb were in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. all of these genes have functions directly or indirectly related to metabolism, glycolysis and cell proliferation which may associate them with cell transformation. table  <dig> shows the major functions and the cellular locations of these  <dig> genes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
large scale screening of genes involved in the arsenic-induced alternation of gene expression is a practical approach for dissecting the molecular pathways of arsenic toxicity. dna microarrays are now widely used to study differential gene expression in relation to arsenic exposure  <cit> . along with our present study, these previous studies illustrate that genes identified via microarray in wide-screening of cells exposed to arsenic can be a valuable tool to determine the mechanism of arsenic toxicity and cancer formation.

in our study, we used an in-house rat dna microarray composed of  <dig>  known genes and  <dig>  ests to investigate differential gene expression in arsenic-treated rat lung cells. this is the first study to focus on arsenic-induced gene expression alterations in the lung. global gene expression patterns were identified by cluster analysis. because of the notable link between arsenic toxicity and cancer formation in other organ systems, genes which have been previously linked with cancer and which may be important in arsenic toxicity were chosen from the  <dig> k microarray clusters to be further confirmed via real-time pcr. real-time pcr verified  <dig> genes at a consistency of 69%.

one of the identified genes, ldha, is involved in glycolysis in metabolism. silencing of this gene has been shown to lead to the increased expression of the ldhb gene and a subsequent abnormal expression of lactose dehydrogenase   <cit> . there seems to be a strong correlation between high ld expression and tumors, which has led to the use of ld as a marker for cancer  <cit> . our study shows a steady decline in the expression of ldha in response to arsenic, which may lead to the typical increase in ld seen in various cancers.

tpi <dig> is a glycolytic enzyme found in mitochondria that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. it plays an important role in several metabolic pathways including fatty acid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis and is essential for efficient energy production  <cit> . tpi <dig> has exhibited varied expression between different types of cancer  <cit>  and may play a role in tumor metabolism. our study shows a steady decline in the expression of tpi <dig> in arsenic-exposed l <dig> cells. further testing will be needed to determine if this phenomenon is constant among lung cancers.

pgk <dig> is a major enzyme found in mitrochondria. its function involves catalyzing the reversible conversion of  <dig>  3-diphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, generating one molecule of atp. many studies have reported overexpression of pgk <dig> in tumors  <cit> . however, a recent study has linked decreased pgk <dig> expression to prostate tumor  <cit> . the same study also found that pgk <dig> showed an inverse expression to cxcr <dig> activation, suggesting that signaling through the cxcr <dig> receptor regulates pgk <dig> and vice versa. our study showed a steady decline in arsenic-treated l <dig> cells. further investigation is needed to determine the expression of pgk <dig> in lung cancers.

cox6a <dig> is the third gene investigated that is found in mitochondria. it is involved in cytochrome oxidase activity and is the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. through its functions, cox helps to produce atp. one study found that cox may be related to the progression of bladder cancer as cox activities were found to be increased during and even after the discontinuance of carcinogen administration in rats  <cit> . our study showed a steady increase in cox6a <dig>  which correlates with the increased expression seen in cancers. the location of tpi <dig>  pgk <dig> and cox6a <dig> suggests that mitochondrial dna may be specifically targeted by arsenic. it has been shown that arsenic causes genetic and epigenetic changes  <cit> . other studies have also linked arsenic to mitochondrial dna damage, where mitochondrial dna-depleted cells produced few or no mutations in response to arsenic exposure compared to intact cells  <cit> . it seems that one way arsenic confers its carcinogenicity is to simply damage components of the cellular respiratory machinery to create ros and/or to decrease the cell's defense against ros. the unchecked ros is thus capable of damaging dna to the point of inducing transformation.

id proteins inhibit transcription by binding basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors through their hlh motif. id proteins are involved in cell growth, development, senescence, differentiation and angiogenesis. several studies have linked id <dig> to cancer  <cit> . furthermore, id proteins are up-regulated in cancer cells in response to hypoxia  <cit> , which points to a secondary role in tumor maintenance as well as carcinogenesis. our study showed an initial spike of id <dig> expression at day  <dig> with a steady decline thereafter. the transient expression may reflect compensatory mechanisms in the l <dig> cells.

gpnmb is involved in bone mineralization and osteoblast differentiation. it was found to be highly expressed in a low-metastatic human melanoma cell line  <cit> ; however, our study showed varied expression throughout the timepoints. gpnmb is a relatively novel gene and more can be determined about their functions and possible role in carcinogenesis with further studies.

in conclusion, through our gene expression profiling of the l <dig> cell line exposed to arsenite, we found differentially expressed genes that may be associated with cancer. our findings show that the altered gene expression is a direct result of arsenic exposure. our analysis links several of the identified genes with functions that include cell growth, cell differentiation and cell metabolism. information gained from this work is valuable for the direction of future experiments involving arsenic toxicity and lung cancer formation.
