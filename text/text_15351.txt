BACKGROUND
the formation of at least one crossover between pairs of homologous chromosomes is necessary for their correct segregation at meiosis i. the stages of interactions between homologous chromosomes that lead to crossover formation have been broadly grouped as: an initial localization of homologous chromosomes within the same region, mediated by interstitial interactions; close pairing and strand exchange at the dna level as a part of recombination; and synapsis between homologous chromosomes together with completion of recombination  <cit> .

recombination at the dna level in yeast and in other organisms is initiated by double strand breaks  made by spo <dig>  <cit> . interaction between dsbs and a homologous intact chromosome can lead to crossover and noncrossover recombination products which are formed by two different pathways  <cit> . processing of dsbs by 5' end resection yields 3' single-stranded ends that asymmetrically invade a homologous chromosome and lead to the formation of a double-holliday junction intermediate which has been proposed to account for the majority of crossovers  <cit> . interaction between homologous chromosomes at the sites of dsbs is promoted by the action of the reca-like strand exchange proteins rad <dig> and dmc <dig>  <cit> . several lines of evidence suggest that rad <dig> and dmc <dig> have different but overlapping functions  <cit>  and interact with distinct sets of proteins in promoting recombination  <cit> . rad <dig> acts in mitosis and in meiosis  <cit>  whereas dmc <dig> is meiosis specific  <cit> .

mnd <dig> was identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae using three different screens based on genetic and functional genomic approaches that were directed at identifying genes that played a role in meiotic recombination and/or chromosome segregation  <cit> . the mnd <dig> mutant shows defects in nuclear division, meiotic recombination, and repair of dsbs. mnd <dig> has been shown to act as a complex with hop <dig>  <cit>  and the mnd1/hop <dig> complex localizes to chromosomes independently of rad <dig> and dmc <dig>  <cit> . genetic studies have provided evidence that hop <dig> and mnd <dig> act in the same pathway as dmc <dig> and rad <dig>  <cit> . biochemical studies using yeast, human, and mouse orthologues have provided evidence that mnd1/hop <dig> stimulates the strand exchange activity of dmc <dig> and that of rad <dig>  <cit> . the interaction of mnd <dig> with hop <dig> has been shown to promote the interaction of hop <dig> with dmc <dig> and stimulate the strand exchange activity of dmc <dig>  <cit> . additional roles for mnd1/hop <dig> that have been proposed are in promoting interhomologue associations at dsbs through interaction with the axial elements or other proteins perhaps by relieving structural constraints  <cit>  and in the designation of dsbs for noncrossover recombination  <cit> .

orthologues of mnd <dig> have been identified in protists, fungi, plants, and animals and some of these have been characterized and shown to have closely related functions  <cit> . in yeast an mnd <dig> disruption has been reported to cause defects only in meiosis and does not result in sensitivity to radiation induced dna damage  <cit> . however, an arabidopsis mutant, atmnd1-Î” <dig> has been recently shown to be sensitive to gamma radiation indicative of a role in mitotic repair, and also to undergo chromosome fragmentation during meiosis  <cit> . here we have used the same mutant allele to analyze the role of the atmnd <dig> gene in meiosis. we show that atmnd <dig> is required for homologous pairing, an early step in the recombination process and that chromosome fragmentation in the atmnd <dig> mutant is likely to be due to defective repair of meiotic dsbs. we also show that consistent with its role in meiosis, atmnd <dig> is strongly expressed in meiocytes.

RESULTS
atmnd <dig> shows increased expression in reproductive tissues
the arabidopsis genome contains a single orthologue of mnd <dig>  corresponding to the annotated gene id no. at4g <dig> and supported by a cdna . the encoded protein shows 26% identity  to mnd <dig> and is  <dig> aa in length which is close to that of mnd <dig> . expression of atmnd <dig> was compared between rosette leaves and inflorescence using real time pcr . the results indicated a 9-fold higher expression of atmnd <dig> in reproductive tissues over leaves consistent with a possible role in reproductive development.

mutation of atmnd <dig> causes male and female sterility due to production of defective gametes
to examine the function of the atmnd <dig> gene we obtained bulked t <dig> seeds of an insertion line salk_ <dig>  <cit>  carrying a t-dna insertion in atmnd <dig> and identified  <dig> plants that were homozygous for the insertion. both plants were found to be sterile  whereas 14/ <dig> plants that were not homozygous for the insertion were fertile. no defects in vegetative development were observed. the progeny of a single plant that was heterozygous for the insertion segregated 84: <dig> fertile:sterile consistent with a single gene recessive trait .  <dig> plants at random were genotyped with respect to the presence of the insertion and all  <dig> that were found to be homozygous for the insertion were also sterile indicating that the phenotype was closely linked to the insertion . the mutant showed a greater than 100-fold reduction in atmnd <dig> expression suggesting that atmnd <dig> function is severely reduced and is probably null . to determine whether sterility was caused by mutation of atmnd <dig>  a  <dig>  kb genomic fragment comprising the atmnd <dig> gene and its promoter region was cloned into a plant binary vector pcambia <dig>  <cit>  and transformed into arabidopsis plants that were heterozygous for the atmnd <dig> insertion allele, using in-planta transformation.  <dig> t <dig> transformant plants that were homozygous for the atmnd <dig> insertion allele were identified out of  <dig> screened and all  <dig> were fertile, whereas among untransformed plants in a segregating population,  <dig> were identified to be homozygous for the atmnd <dig> insertion allele and all were sterile  which demonstrates that the sterile phenotype is caused by mutation of atmnd <dig> 

reciprocal crosses were carried out between wild type and mutant to identify the developmental defects underlying sterility, and the results in table  <dig> indicate that the mutant shows both male and female sterility. observation of anthers showed that the pollen grains in the mutant were shrunken  and inviable  as determined by alexander staining  <cit> . also the anther lobes remained below the level of the stigma as a result of reduced elongation of the anther filament. likewise, examination of cleared ovules showed that in the mutant, postmeiotic development of the female gametophyte was arrested at the functional megaspore stage followed by degeneration of the functional megaspore . about  <dig> % of the developed ovules contained a mature embryo sac, which is consistent with the small number of seeds produced in the mutant. these results indicated that the mutant is male and female sterile due to both pollen and embryo sac formation being defective.

data shown are from a minimum of ten crosses.

stages of female gametophyte development relative to ovule stages in the atmnd <dig> mutant and wild type. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> ovules were scored for the atmnd <dig> mutant and wild-type respectively. megagametogenesis defects are evident from stage 3- <dig> in case of the mutant, which leads to embryo sac arrest and eventually its degeneration. ovule stages are according to  <cit> : 3- <dig>  3- <dig>  and 3- <dig> are postmeiotic stages of the sporophyte with respect to elongation of the integuments where the wild type gametophyte would normally reach the 1n, 2n, and 4n stages; 3- <dig> corresponds to a mature ovule prior to fertilization. mes, mature embryo sac; degen, degenerated embryo sac; m, mutant; +, wild type; nd, not detected.

atmnd <dig> is strongly expressed at meiosis
to obtain more detailed information on the expression pattern of atmnd <dig> in relation to the mutant phenotype we examined expression in inflorescence tissue sections by rna in-situ hybridization using antisense rna complementary to atmnd <dig> cdna . a basal level of expression was observed throughout reproductive tissues. in addition strong expression of atmnd <dig> was found within anther lobes at meiotic stages . the earliest increase in expression was detected in sporogenous cells at anther stage  <dig>  <cit> . strong expression was observed in stage  <dig> anthers within microspore mother cells and also the tapetum. a high level of expression continued to be observed within meiotic cells during anther stage  <dig> and declined after meiosis. an increase in expression of atmnd <dig> was also detected within the megaspore mother cell in ovules although not as strongly as observed in microsporocytes .

atmnd <dig> is required for homologous pairing
the expression pattern of atmnd <dig> and the phenotype of the atmnd <dig> mutant are together suggestive of a defect in meiosis. we therefore compared meiotic prophase stages from the mutant and wild type using spread preparations of meiotic chromosomes following the method of ross et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . the initial stages of meiotic prophase corresponding to early leptotene were seen to occur in the atmnd <dig> mutant and thread-like chromosomes were apparent . association of the nucleolar heterochromatin present on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> as well as the synizetic knot, which is formed during late leptotene concomitant with pairing and the start of synapsis  <cit>  could also be observed . however, abnormalities could be detected starting at the zygotene stage, both with respect to the appearance of the chromosomes and the organization of pericentromeric heterochromatin. chromosomes in the mutant appeared less compact when compared to wild type and pericentromeric heterochromatin regions were more extended and unpaired than at the corresponding stage in wild type . during the course of zygotene, the differences became more pronounced, and synapsis was defective. the thickening of chromosomes along segments of their length representing synapsed regions, that characteristically appears during zygotene and is complete by pachytene, did not take place in the mutant . at diplotene the chromosomes appeared as a diffuse and fragmented mass with 10â€“ <dig> separate spots of condensed pericentromeric heterochromatin . at diakinesis, separated chromosomes and fragments could be clearly distinguished . the sorting of these fragments at anaphase i and ii was irregular and bridges could be observed . following meiosis polyads that contained a variable number of fragmented chromosomes were formed . these gave rise to defective spores that did not form viable pollen. female meiosis in the mutant was also defective and chromosome fragmentation was observed . these data suggested the possibility that the mutant is defective in homologous pairing and synapsis and the accumulation of fragments may arise from defects in repair of dsbs.

to examine homologous pairing we carried out fish experiments  using a telomere repeat based oligonucleotide probe that hybridizes strongly to the centromere of chromosome  <dig> but not to centromeres of the remaining chromosomes  <cit> . in wild type, two well separated signals were observed at leptotene indicating that chromosomes were unpaired . a single signal was observed at late zygotene  and pachytene  indicative of pairing and synapsis having taken place . at diplotene, twin signals close to each other  were seen indicative of centromere regions having desynapsed . these twin signals again merged and at metaphase i only a single signal was seen . the atmnd <dig> mutant showed two widely separated signals starting from leptotene and throughout all subsequent stages  indicating that homologous pairing as well as synapsis was defective .

chromosome fragmentation in atmnd <dig> is suppressed by a mutation in atspo11-1
the chromosome fragmentation phenotype together with the absence of homologous pairing suggested that the atmnd <dig> mutant was defective in recombination possibly due to defects in the repair of meiotic dsbs. atspo11- <dig> is one of three spo <dig> homologues in arabidopsis and is specifically required for recombination and synapsis during meiosis  <cit> . to test whether fragmentation was dependent upon atspo11- <dig>  a plant that was heterozygous for atmnd <dig> was crossed to a salk insertion line  that was heterozygous for a t-dna insertion in the seventh intron of atspo11- <dig>  <cit> . f <dig> plants that carried both insertions were identified in the f <dig> and homozygous atmnd <dig> atspo11- <dig> double mutants were obtained in the f <dig>  analysis of male meiotic chromosome spreads of the double mutant and comparison to the atspo11- <dig> single mutant indicated that the chromosome fragmentation phenotype of atmnd <dig> was suppressed by atspo11- <dig> . chromosomes in the double mutant did not undergo fragmentation after diplotene  and remained as intact univalents that segregated randomly at the first meiotic division . the double mutant phenotype resembled that of the atspo11- <dig> mutant. atspo11- <dig> is therefore epistatic to atmnd <dig> 

discussion
pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes at meiosis relies on search for homology using resected ends that are created at the sites of dsbs. this search is mediated by the action of reca-like strand exchange proteins rad <dig> and dmc <dig> which bind to single stranded dna and promote the formation of joint molecules  <cit> . the strand exchange activity of dmc <dig> and rad <dig> is stimulated by hop <dig> and mnd <dig> which cooperate together as a complex  <cit> . both hop <dig> and mnd <dig> are required in yeast for homologous pairing and meiotic dsb repair  <cit> . we have shown in this study that the arabidopsis orthologue of mnd <dig>  atmnd <dig> is required for homologous pairing during meiosis in arabidopsis where it is likely to play a role in the repair of meiotic dsbs. atmnd <dig> also shows strong expression in meiocytes.

the early defects in the atmnd <dig> mutant with respect to overall appearance of chromosomes during meiosis were a lack of thickening during zygotene and absence of subsequent synapsis at pachytene. fragmentation of chromosomes became apparent at diplotene and isolated univalents and fragments were first visible at diakinesis. fish analysis using a centromere  <dig> specific probe indicated that homologous pairing did not take place in the mutant during zygotene and homologous chromosomes remained apart throughout meiotic prophase and meiosis i.

the meiotic phenotype of atmnd <dig> is similar to that caused by a mutation in ahp <dig> which encodes the arabidopsis orthologue of hop <dig>  <cit> . in both cases there is chromosome fragmentation and a defect in homologous pairing. the failure to synapse and the appearance of fragmented chromosomes late in meiotic prophase i is a feature of several arabidopsis mutants that are implicated in processing and repair of dsbs  <cit> . the observation that atspo11- <dig> suppressed the chromosome fragmentation phenotype of atmnd <dig> supports the interpretation that atmnd <dig> is also defective in meiotic dsb repair. a major difference between the meiotic phenotype of yeast mnd <dig> and that for atmnd <dig> in arabidopsis is the absence of meiotic arrest in arabidopsis whereas mnd <dig> shows prophase arrest which is alleviated by a mutation in mec <dig>  a major regulator of dna damage induced checkpoints  <cit> . a lack of arrest is also seen in the case of ahp <dig> whereas hop <dig> shows prophase arrest  <cit> . the failure to arrest in the case of arabidopsis is likely to be due to the absence or leakiness of meiotic dna damage checkpoints and has also been observed for other arabidopsis meiotic mutants for which the yeast counterparts show prophase arrest  <cit> .

the yeast mnd <dig> gene is expressed and functions only in meiosis and is not considered to play a role in mitotic dna repair  <cit> . the atmnd <dig> gene is dispensable for somatic development, however the atmnd <dig> mutant is defective in mitotic dna repair and atmnd <dig> is induced in response to gamma irradiation  <cit>  pointing to an evolutionary difference between yeast and plants with respect to the role of mnd <dig>  in plants the major pathway for repair of dsbs in somatic cells is non-homologous end joining  whereas in yeast the homologous recombination pathway predominates, which may explain the requirement for hop2/mnd <dig> in promoting efficient repair of dsbs and the maintenance of genome integrity in somatic cells  <cit> . orthologues of mnd <dig> and hop <dig> are not present in c. elegans and drosophila melanogaster both of which do not require dsbs for homologous synapsis at meiosis  <cit> .

in addition to being strongly induced in meiocytes at the time of meiosis we found that atmnd <dig> is also expressed in the tapetum at the same time. we have earlier noticed this to also be the case for the duet gene which has a male meiosis specific phenotype  <cit> . it is possible that the tapetal expression at the same time as in meiocytes may reflect an overlap in the expression profile between tapetal cells and microspore mother cells which form adjacent layers and are both descended from the archesporial cell. indeed the secondary parietal cells that are the precursors of the tapetum appear to retain the developmental potential to form meiocytes as revealed by mutations in exs/ems <dig>  <cit>  and tpd <dig>  <cit>  where microsporocytes are formed in place of tapetal cells. we also note that the onset of increased expression of atmnd <dig> appears to be at anther stage  <dig> in a region occupied by sporogenous cells that are the precursors of male meiocytes. this stage is prior to the formation of meiocytes and initiation of recombination. these observations would suggest that the regulatory mechanisms responsible for increased expression of atmnd <dig> in reproductive tissues may be distinct from those for dna damage inducible expression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary we have shown that atmnd <dig> is required for homologous pairing and repair of dsbs during meiosis in arabidopsis. loss of atmnd <dig> does not affect normal vegetative development but causes male and female sterility due to fragmentation and defective segregation of chromosomes in meiosis.
