BACKGROUND
rice is the staple food for nearly half of the world’s population. the world per capita rice consumption in 2013– <dig> was  <dig>  kg/yr of milled rice , representing approximately 19 % of the average world per capita caloric intake and 13 % of the protein intake  <cit> . italy represents the first european rice producer, with more than 50 % of the total paddy production and consumers’ requests driven by tradition and quality. important traits influencing milling properties, appearance, grain shape, nutritional value, cooking quality and yield have recently been dissected and most of them, e.g. cooking properties, texture, gelatinization temperature , chalkiness, are related to starch, seed-storage proteins  and grain shape . in addition, vitamin e compounds, including both tocopherols and tocotrienols, and γ-oryzanol, accumulate in the germ and in the bran fraction during grain development and are important components of rice oil, to which confer functional features thanks to their antioxidant properties  <cit> . eating quality therefore represents an ensemble of complex traits controlled by multiple factors  <cit>  and to date, a number of quantitative trait loci  affecting rice quality have been identified . moreover, several genes involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of starch, ssps and vitamins have been characterized  <cit> .

together with amylopectin, amylose is the main component of starch and its percentage on total starch, measured as apparent amylose content , represents the key determinant of rice cooking properties. high aac cultivars , like some italian risotto varieties, result dry and firm after cooking; whereas low aac grains cook tender and glossy  <cit> . the granule-bound starch synthase i  enzyme, encoded by the waxy  gene, regulates starch accumulation in developing caryopsis, and the amount of amylose in grains is directly associated with the levels of the enzyme in the endosperm  <cit> . wx is subjected also to a post-transcriptional regulation, since the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism  at the 5’ splice site of the first intron affects the pre-mrna processing promoting alternative splicing at cryptic sites of exon  <dig> causing a reduced accumulation of functional enzyme and the occurrence of a glutinous phenotype  <cit> . other enzymes playing key roles in starch biosynthesis are adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , which is regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme in starch biosynthesis as it catalyzes the synthesis of the starch chain primer, starch synthases , starch branching enzymes  and starch debranching enzymes , responsible for the biosynthesis of the branched amylopectin chains  <cit> . furthermore, functional snps in the ssiia gene are responsible for high gts  <cit> .

hundreds of genes encode for ssps which not only provide a source of amino acids to be used during germination and seedling growth, but also have a deep impact on nutritional quality and food processing  <cit> . in rice, ssps account for 10 % of grain composition with glutelins  and prolamins  representing the main classes. fifteen rice genes, per haploid genome, are known to encode for glus and are classified into four subfamilies: glua – four members, glub – eight members, gluc – two members and glud – one member  <cit> . a multigene family, composed by 80– <dig> copies per haploid genome, encodes instead for prolms  <cit> . another small fraction of cereal ssps is represented by globulins and albumins which are associated with allergenicity  <cit> . the ssps nutritional value is also related to the content of essential amino acids   <cit> .

rice bran oil is the product of extraction of milling by-products, namely germ or bran, and represents a source of antioxidant and disease-preventative properties thanks to the presence of phytonutrients such as γ-oryzanol, basically composed by steryl ferulates, and vitamin e compounds  <cit> . most of the vitamin e biosynthetic genes  have been characterized in a. thaliana, enabling their identification in different species, such as rice, and leading to the characterization of the biosynthetic pathways of tocopherols and tocotrienols . on the other hand, very little is known about the biosynthesis and accumulation of γ-oryzanol even if some genes have been demonstrated to be key regulators of sterols biosynthesis  <cit> .

since comparisons of quality traits among cvs grown in the same environment revealed significant variations  <cit> , it is of great interest to understand how the loci regulating the accumulation of starch, ssps and vte compounds are expressed and coordinated during grain filling. transcription analyses during caryopsis development have shown that the highest accumulation of mrnas for most of the starch synthase genes occurs between 6– <dig> days after flowering , with the exception of wx which showed two expression peaks at  <dig> and  <dig> daf, respectively  <cit> . however, duan and sun   <cit>  demonstrated that the peak levels of several genes involved in the starch biosynthetic pathway could extend to  <dig> daf. the expression of glus encoding genes usually peaked at  <dig> daf  <cit> , but some studies showed increasing expression until  <dig> daf for example for glud- <dig>  <cit> . for one 10-kda and three 13-kda prolms the same expression pattern as glus was observed, with the exception of additional two 13-kda prolms encoding genes for which transcription increases toward seed maturation  and of two 16 k-da prolms mrnas that accumulated until 26– <dig> daf  <cit> .

to investigate the genetic bases underlying the qualitative differences characterizing traditional italian rice cvs, a comparative rna-seq-based transcriptomic analysis of developing seeds was conducted at  <dig> daf on six popular italian varieties  differing for several qualitative grain-related traits. the  <dig> daf timing was chosen because a number of important traits  have been reported to show a high level of expression at, or close to,  <dig> daf. co-regulation analyses of differentially expressed genes  showing the same expression profile in the six cvs, highlighted classes of genes specifically up-regulated for each variety, leading to a transcriptional characterization of developing seeds of the main italian rice cvs and to the identification of candidates that might affect the peculiar grain traits of the six varieties. we aimed at finding out whether the transcription profiles at  <dig> daf were able to explain the qualitative differences among the italian rice varieties studied and our results suggest that rice quality traits can be described in details through a gene expression analysis at  <dig> daf, and that the qualitative differences among the main italian rice varieties are associated to specific gene expression profiles.

RESULTS
standard phenotypic evaluations
considering the commercial classification reported by suwannaporn et al.   <cit>  for aac, the cvs analyzed were grouped in three different aac classes : carnaroli  - high aac ; arborio  - low aac ; while the other genotypes belonged to the intermediate aac class , with volano  and balilla  showing lower percentages of amylose with respect to gigante vercelli  and the risotto variety vialone nano . bal represented the cv with the lowest amount of total ssps , while arb and vn showed the highest values  . the “eu regulation on the common organisation of the market in rice”  no 1308/2013; https://www.fsai.ie/legislation/legislation_update/december_ <dig> html#common_organisation_of_the_markets_in_agricultural_products) distinguishes four categories, based on grain length  and length/width  ratio of naked caryopsis: long a: l > <dig>  mm, l/w  <dig> – <dig> ; long b: l > <dig> , l/w >  <dig> ; medium: l  <dig> - <dig> , l/w <  <dig> ; round: l < <dig> , l/w < <dig> . according to eu classification the round seed variety bal showed the shortest  and slimmest  grain. this genotype was followed by the medium seed variety vn for which we detected  <dig>  mm paddy seed length and  <dig>  naked seed length . all the other cvs belonged to the long a group. analysis of tocochromanols content revealed that vn had the lowest levels for all the different classes ), while bal showed the highest quantity , a behaviour ascribable to the particular high amounts of α and γ-tocotrienols. gv showed relevant levels of γ and δ-tocopherols, whereas car was characterized by the highest amount of α-tocopherol . the quantities of β-tocotrienol and β- and δ-tocopherols were too low to be considered . bal also represents the genotype with the highest amount of γ-oryzanol , followed by car and vol , while the lowest level of this compound was detected for vn  . car showed the lowest milling head yield , followed by vn , while the highest values were detected for bal , vol  and arb  . arb and vn displayed intermediate gt, whereas the other cvs belonged to the low gt class . bal grains carried small chalkiness, with a short lateral stripe. for the other genotypes we observed a large chalkiness  that was associated to long lateral stripes, with the exception of car, which displayed also a central chalkiness, and vn, differing from the others for the presence of a short chalky lateral stripe.table  <dig> phenotypic evaluations performed for the six cvs

rna-seq analysis and identification of differentially expressed genes 
rna was isolated from developing caryopsis of the six rice cvs at  <dig> daf, as many genes of interest for grain quality are highly expressed in the first two weeks after fertilization, whereas others are more expressed in the subsequent weeks. in fact,  <dig> daf represents a critical time-point for the determination of chalkiness and the mid-time for the biosynthesis and accumulation of starch and ssps  <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig> millions of filtered reads were obtained  and mapped with bowtie/tophat to rice genome . an rpkm  cutoff value of  <dig>  was set to declare a locus expressed resulting in  <dig>  loci above the expression cutoff in at least one genotype. pearson correlation coefficients for biological replicates from the same genotype were always above  <dig>   indicating a good level of reproducibility . the r package deseq was employed to normalize and compare expression data. pair-wise comparisons among all the six genotypes were conducted to call the degs using a false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig> . vol was the genotype showing the highest number of degs when compared to the others varieties:  <dig> vs. arb,  <dig> vs. car,  <dig> vs. bal,  <dig> vs. gv and  <dig> vs. vn. this cv showed also the highest number of under-expressed genes, with respect to the over-expressed ones, in all the comparisons. several of the comparisons between gv and the other cvs resulted instead in the lowest numbers of degs:  <dig> vs. bal,  <dig> vs. car and  <dig> vs. vn .fig.  <dig> differentially modulated genes from pair-wise comparisons. a mean expression versus log <dig> fold change  plots  representing the degs in the pair-wise comparisons, considering the expression in the second cv indicated with respect to the first one. normalised expression mean values are plotted versus log2fc and degs are visualized as coloured dots. b for each comparison the numbers of over-expressed and under-expressed genes in the second cv with respect to the first one indicated and the total degs are reported



clusters analysis
in order to identify clusters of genes showing genotype-specific expression patterns, a co-expression analysis was conducted. toward this end, a matrix of tractable size for correlation analysis was obtained by narrowing the entire gene rice pool above rpkm cutoff  to the subset of genes called as degs in at least one pair-wise  contrast and exhibiting a fc of at least  <dig> . eight major clusters were identified, each of them characterized by genes with a comparatively higher expression in one or at most few cvs . the number of genes and the prototypical consensus expression patterns of each cluster in the six cvs are summarized in fig.  <dig>  the complete list of degs belonging to each cluster with the corresponding results for the pair-wise comparisons are indicated in additional file 4-sheets  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. to functionally classify the members of the clusters we resorted to go enrichment analyses and discovered peculiar enriched classes of genes in each cluster .fig.  <dig> general representation of the clusters obtained by the co-regulation analysis. numbers indicating each cluster are reported. node colours corresponds to the mean expression values, calculated on the base of the number of reads mapping at each locus on rice reference genome, for all the varieties considering the three biological replicates and a scale from white, representing low expression, to purple, corresponding to high transcription

total number for each category is reported and the number of degs putatively undergoing to alternative splicing is indicated in brackets



cluster 1
cluster  <dig> included two sub-clusters: cluster  <dig> , consisting of  <dig> genes showing higher expression in both bal and gv, and cluster  <dig> , composed of  <dig> loci over-expressed only in bal . both the sub-clusters were mainly represented by degs belonging to the go term “defence response” , with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . for example, sub-cluster  <dig>  included loci encoding for nb-lrr resistance genes, three stripe rust resistance proteins yr <dig> and the tf wrky <dig>  known to modulate defence signal transduction  <cit>  . for sub-cluster  <dig> , besides resistance genes or disease resistance proteins, we found a gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> encoding for thionins , a class of proteins playing important roles in plant immunity and also of interest in human health and agribusiness  <cit>  . the enrichment of defense-related genes observed in cluster  <dig> was not ascribable to pathogen infection, since the rice developing caryopses used for the transcriptomic analyses were not affected by pathogens. a rationale for the observed enrichment in defense-related transcripts is related to the fact that since seeds represent a rich source of food for plant pathogens, they also are important sites of plant defence. pathogen-free seeds express genes otherwise known to be associated with pathogen infection in other tissues, presumably contributing to pre-formed or primed systems for defending the seed against pathogen attack. activation of defense responses in pathogen-free developing seeds was indeed observed in several cereals including barley  <cit>  and rice  <cit> .

cluster 2
with  <dig> members, cluster  <dig> was the cluster containing the highest number of degs and showed up-regulation mainly for car, followed by arb and bal, and down-regulation for vol. however exceptions occurred as  <dig> genes were mostly transcribed in arb, followed by car and bal . the genes belonging to cluster  <dig> were mainly implicated in “developmental process” , “gene expression”  and “protein metabolism” . other well represented enriched go terms were “response to abiotic stimulus” , “defence response”  and “cellular carbohydrate metabolic process”  . three loci encoding for tetratricopeptide domain containing proteins, a class known to influence endosperm appearance  <cit> , and five for proteins carrying wd domains, present in factors affecting the biosynthesis of nutraceutical compounds such as flavonoids  <cit> , were present among the  <dig> degs affecting developmental processes . among the  <dig> loci implicated in “protein metabolism”,  <dig> members belonging to “protein phosphorylation” ,  <dig> to “protein ubiquitination” ,  <dig> to “protein transport”  and  <dig> chaperons were identified. this last group contained some dnaj encoding loci and the dnak-bip gene  which regulates the accumulation of ssps in rice endosperm and the level of chalkiness in grains  <cit>  . in the “cellular carbohydrate metabolic process” group, genes affecting cell wall biosynthesis such as  <dig> -β-glucan synthases, cellulose synthases and putative glycosyl transferases  <dig> were present. the glycosyl transferase  <dig> encoded by loc_os06g <dig> and the cellulose synthases cesa <dig>  and csld <dig>  were tightly co-regulated with loc_os02g <dig>  encoding for a tetratricopeptide repeat domain containing protein and several loci involved in signal transduction: the strubbelig–receptor loc_os03g <dig>  the gata zinc finger loc_os02g <dig>  the ste_mekk_ste11_map3k. <dig> loc_os04g <dig>  the crrlk1l- <dig> loc_os01g <dig>  a feronia receptor kinase , belonging to a class of proteins demonstrated to regulate cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> , and a mps gene  . different tfs were identified in the “gene expression” go term, including myb tfs and zinc fingers of types c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h, c3hc <dig>  c2h <dig>  cw and gata. moreover, two tfs positively affecting rice grain length, oswrky <dig> - loc_os07g <dig> and the apetala  <dig>  tf srs <dig> - loc_os07g <dig>  <cit> , were detected . interestingly, through the homeobox locus loc_os01g <dig>  the cellulose synthase cslc <dig>  was tightly associated to the myb loc_os05g <dig> and to the c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h zinc finger loc_os03g <dig> ; while the myb loc_os03g <dig> belonged to a sub-cluster including loc_os10g <dig>  and loc_os01g <dig>  . other functional groups for cluster  <dig> were represented by  <dig> genes acting in “lipid metabolism” , four of which affecting wax biosynthesis,  <dig> degs involved in the biosynthesis of nutraceutical compounds, like flavonoids and arabinogalactans, and  <dig> loci implicated in “oxidation-reduction process”  .fig.  <dig> bar-plots of some tightly co-expressed loci in cluster  <dig>  a, b and c different sub-clusters of tightly co-regulated loci belonging to cluster  <dig>  mean expression values, corresponding to the number of reads mapping at each locus on rice reference genome , of the three biological replicates  for each cv  are represented



cluster 3
cluster  <dig> was represented by  <dig> genes mostly expressed in vn . with respect to the other clusters, cluster  <dig> showed the highest representation of the go terms “defense response”  and “response to abiotic stimulus” . in this last class, genes implicated in “response to radiation”  and “response to wounding”  were identified. seventeen cluster 3-specific degs encoded for proteins involved in the biosynthesis of nutraceutical compounds, such as alkaloids , flavonoids , terpenoids , glycans  and glucans . however, seven loci corresponded to allergenic proteins: loc_os01g <dig> - cupin domain containing protein, loc_os05g <dig> - proteophosphoglycan ppg <dig>  loc_os12g <dig> - thaumatin and four ltp  allergens. other well represented go terms for cluster  <dig> were “developmental process”, containing  <dig> loci, and “oxidation-reduction process” , including a total of  <dig> degs,  <dig> of which encoding for cytochromes p <dig>   <dig> for glutathione s-transferases,  <dig> for oxidoreductases and  <dig> for peroxidases .

cluster 4
two hundred nine genes up-regulated in vol belonged to cluster  <dig>  which showed the highest number of degs  implicated in “oxidation-reduction process”, including  <dig> loci encoding for cytochromes and  <dig> for glutathione s-transferases, and for “lipid metabolism” . another enriched go term well represented in this cluster was “protein metabolism”, counting for  <dig> loci, with both the go terms “protein transport”  and “proteolysis involved in cellular protein catabolic process”  including  <dig> genes . moreover, different loci implicated in protein biosynthesis, like the ribosomal proteins s <dig>  s <dig>  s9- <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and s <dig>  and the glutamine synthetase loc_os03g <dig> were identified. besides these,  <dig> genes participated to nutraceutical compounds biosynthetic pathways, like the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase  <dig> precursor  and the terpene synthase , involved in the biosynthesis of γ-oryzanol . however, the precursor of ra5/ra14/ra <dig> allergens ral <dig> , which accumulates 15– <dig> days after flowering  <cit> , belonged to this cluster .

cluster 5
cluster  <dig> consisted of two sub-clusters:  <dig> , containing  <dig> degs more expressed in arb with respect to all the other cvs, and  <dig> , including  <dig> degs up-regulated in arb, followed by bal, gv and vn . the most enriched go classes for both the sub-clusters were “response to abiotic stimulus”  and “protein metabolism” . for this last group, factors involved in protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination and folding were identified . moreover,  <dig> degs affecting gene expression were detected for both the sub-clusters which included tfs such as gata zinc finger, bzip, osmads <dig> and oswrky <dig>  loci affecting cell wall biosynthesis were specifically identified for sub-cluster  <dig>  and included the cellulose synthase cesa <dig>  a polygalacturonase inhibitor, a xylanase inhibitor and the nac domain-containing protein  <dig>  belonging to a class of tfs which activate the biosynthesis of cell wall  <cit> . even with only two members, the thiamine biosynthesis protein thic loc_os03g <dig> and the fad dependent oxidoreductase domain containing protein loc_os07g <dig>  the go term “vitamin biosynthetic process”  was a prerogative of sub-cluster  <dig>  .

cluster 6
cluster  <dig> was represented by  <dig> degs up-regulated in gv and mainly enriched of loci implicated in protein metabolism  and in particular in protein phosphorylation  . one glu encoding gene  and three prolms corresponding loci  were also identified as belonging to this cluster .

cluster 7
cluster  <dig> included  <dig> genes over-expressed in car, with some exceptions showing higher expression in bal, followed by car . with,  <dig> degs, cluster  <dig> showed the highest enrichment for the go term “carbohydrate metabolism” which included a ss, an amidase, a glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase, the os5bglu <dig> - beta-glucosidase and some genes involved in glycolytic processes. moreover, inside this go term, degs affecting the “secondary cell wall biogenesis” were also detected. examples are loc_os03g <dig>  encoding for a cobra-like protein precursor, belonging to a class of proteins regulating cellulose deposition  <cit> , and four loci encoding for proteins carrying a duf domain, which has been hypothesized to have a role in cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . also  <dig> loci implicated in nutraceutical compounds metabolism like arabinogalactans  and thiamines  were identified in this cluster. furthermore, genes encoding for known allergens like ltpl <dig>  and ltpl <dig>  were identified. three degs corresponded to enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and, in particular, loc_os03g <dig> encoded for a 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase belonging also to the go term “wax biosynthesis” , together with other four genes .

cluster 8
cluster  <dig> included  <dig> car up-regulated genes , eight of which involved in the response to abiotic stresses and five in cell wall biosynthesis, like the chitinase chit <dig>  and the glucan endo- <dig> -β -glucosidase-like protein  <dig> precursor encoded by loc_os05g <dig> 

genes affecting grain quality
to analyse the expression profiles of other genes affecting grain quality, not belonging to the main co-expression clusters, we performed go enrichment analyses of all the degs identified in the pair-wise comparisons. a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> degs for “starch biosynthetic process” , “starch metabolism”  and “starch catabolic process” , respectively, were identified. in addition,  <dig> degs were detected for “ssps” , while  <dig> were discovered for “tfs”  . since a go classification for ssps transporters, allergens, regulation of seed size, eas biosynthesis and degradation, tocochromanols and sterols biosynthesis  was not available, literature searches implemented with the use of the gramene database  and the mapman software  <cit> , were applied for these categories, leading to the detection of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> total degs, respectively for each of the category indicated .

starch
the highest number of degs belonging to starch biosynthesis and metabolism were detected in the comparisons arb vs. car, vn vs. vol and bal vs. vn, while the starch catabolic process go term was more enriched in arb vs. vn, arb vs. vol and bal vs. car . as expected, the waxy gene  was more expressed  in the varieties showing the highest values of aac  with respect to the other cvs . this gene belongs to a small co-regulated cluster of four loci, including loc_os06g <dig> corresponding to a hypothetical protein, loc_os04g <dig>  encoding for a f-box/lrr-repeat protein  <dig>  belonging to a class of proteins involved in protein ubiquitination  <cit> , and loc_os01g <dig>  corresponding to a bowman-birk type bran trypsin inhibitor precursor - bbti <dig>  belonging to a group of factors with antioxidant capacity  <cit>  . igv  visualization of the reads mapping at the wx locus, on the nipponbare reference genome, for the six genotypes, revealed the retention of the first intron, typical of the wxb allele, for the low aac arb, bal and vol , in all the three biological replicates . on the other hand, the high aac genotypes had a complete splicing  . pca analyses conducted using the expression values for the six cvs of all the degs involved in starch biosynthesis, catabolism and metabolism, showed that  <dig>  % of phenotypic variance  was due to the expression of a single gene identified in wx. aac is also influenced by the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , the first starch biosynthetic enzyme in seeds  <cit> . the seed-specific isoform of the small subunit of agpase  was from  <dig>  to  <dig>  less expressed in the round seed bal with respect to the high aac varieties . conversely, loc_os05g <dig> encoding for the regulative large subunit of agpase, positively linked to grain weight  <cit> , was more expressed in the longest seed vol, but less transcribed in the medium grain vn . despite the fact that the main determinant of gt, ssiia , was not highly differentially expressed in the pair-wise comparisons , two alleles, both defined by non synonymous snps, were identified in all the three biological replicates among our genotypes performing igv mapping at the ssiia locus . gv carried the gtg to atg snp, with respect to the nipponbare reference sequence, at 4198 bp, while the other cvs showed the ctc to ttc mutation at 4330 bp. both the mutations corresponded to characterized functional snps  <cit>  . the only covalent modification of starch is phosphorylation, catalized by the α-glucan water dikinase  enzyme   <cit>  which showed lower expression, with fc values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the main italian risotto varieties car and vn, with respect to the other cvs .fig.  <dig> expression of genes belonging to the wx cluster. a representation of the wx cluster and bar-plots indicating the mean expression values, corresponding to the number of reads mapping at each locus on rice reference genome , of the three biological replicates  for each cv . b sashimi plots of rna-seq reads aligned at loc_os06g <dig>  on nipponbare reference genome, in the six different varieties. only one biological replicate for each genotype is represented. the alignments were performed using the igv software. the coverage for each alignment track is plotted as a bar graph. coverage ranges for each variety are reported in the bars on the left. arcs represent splice junctions. junction depth is indicated by the number in the arc and the thickness of the arc. graphs were built setting a min junction coverage corresponding to the 1 % of the mean exons coverage. the alternative isoforms of the gene annotated in the rice genome browser msu database are reported in the lower bar. thick and intermediate boxes represent exons and 5’ and 3’-utr regions, respectively. lines between boxes indicate introns. the mapping coverage for each variety at the level of each exon and intron is represented by the coloured parts

seed storage proteins and allergens
bal vs. vol showed the highest number of degs for the “ssps” go term , while bal vs. gv and gv vs. vn showed the lowest . among the  <dig> degs belonging to this go term,  <dig> encoded for prolms,  <dig> for glus and  <dig> for albumins . bal, carrying the lowest amount of protein in grains , showed the lowest level of transcription for most of the glus encoding loci. conversely, the highest transcription for glus was detected for car . arb is the genotype with the highest amount of proteins  and showed higher expression of the glu locus loc_os02g <dig>  with respect to all the other genotypes. despite the fact that vn is the second cv with the highest level of proteins in seeds , it did not show particular over-expression of genes encoding for glus. in this group, seven genes  were predicted to be subjected to alternative splicing . gv and vol, having both  <dig>  % of proteins in seeds, represented the genotypes with the highest expression of prolms. as mentioned above, prolm <dig>  prolm <dig> and prolm <dig> belonged to the gv up-regulated cluster  <dig>  while vol, with fcs ranging from about  <dig> to about  <dig>  showed the highest expression for prolm <dig>  and prolm <dig> . for both the cvs, high transcription was also observed for prolm <dig>  and prolm <dig> . no alternative splicing was predicted for this class of genes . the seed specific risbz <dig>  bzip tf, activating the transcription of ssps encoding genes in rice  <cit> , was about two times more expressed in vol with respect to the other cvs . several genes known to regulate the deposition of ssps into protein bodies  were identified among degs . these included the bip chaperon , slightly  more expressed in car as mentioned above, rab <dig> gtpase up-regulated in vn , three genes encoding for different isoforms of sar <dig> gtpase , and rbp , involved in the accumulation of prolms, with the highest fc values  identified for rbp-b , mostly expressed in vol . analyzing loci belonging to the co-regulation clusters, we could identify genes encoding for allergenic proteins specifically more expressed in certain varieties, with respect to the others. the expression profiles in the pair-wise comparisons of other genes belonging to this class, but not included in the co-regulated clusters, was also dissected. in addition to the degs in the up-regulated clusters, vol and vn displayed over-expression also for different ltpls, including ltpl <dig>  for both the genotypes, and ltpl <dig> , ltpl <dig>  for vol. furthermore, car-specific up-regulation, with respect to the other cvs, was detected for ltpl <dig>  and ltpl <dig> . conversely, bal showed the lowest transcription rates for ltpl <dig>  . one of the major allergenic classes of proteins in rice is represented by albumins  <cit>  and, among our degs, three loci  encoded for precursors of 2s albumins, with significant differences in expression in most of the pair-wise comparisons. down-regulation was observed for bal, while car and vol displayed double expression for loc_os11g <dig> and loc_os05g <dig>  respectively, in comparison to the other accessions . other typical allergenic ssps are the cupin domain containing proteins  <cit>  for which we identified  <dig> encoding degs. in general, bal and arb had the lowest expression, while vn showed the highest . as examples, for loc_os08g <dig> the expression in vn was about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times higher with respect to arb, bal and car, respectively, while for loc_os01g <dig> the fcs were about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in comparison to bal, car and gv, respectively .

nutraceutical compounds
analysis of the pair-wise comparisons data focused on genes associated to nutraceutical compounds highlighted that vol showed up-regulation for two genes involved in terpenoids biosynthesis and encoding for the terpene synthase loc_os04g <dig> and the ent-kaurene synthase loc_os04g <dig>  moreover, a small cluster of five genes containing a flavonol synthase  tightly associated to a duf domain containing protein  in turn related to a myb tf , belonging to a class of tf that regulates flavonol biosynthesis in rice  <cit> , showed higher expression in car .

according to gramene database annotation, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified as involved in eas biosynthesis and catabolism, respectively. among these,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were predicted to be subjected to alternative splicing . on the bases of our comparisons, a peculiar regulation of genes belonging to this category for each genotype was highlighted. vol represents the cv with the highest number of modulated genes, with  <dig> and  <dig> degs involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of eas, respectively, and particularly belonging to the asp family. furthermore, arb displayed down-regulation of two genes involved in asp biosynthesis and two genes belonging to the trp biosynthetic pathway. two loci participating to his biosynthesis were specifically more transcribed in gv .

a total of  <dig> unique genes involved in tocochromanols biosynthesis were identified as degs in our experiment . arb was the genotype with the highest number of modulated genes in most of the comparisons: about  <dig>  all down-regulated. by contrast, car showed up-regulation for several loci. another nutraceutical component of rice brain oil is γ-oryzanol which is composed by ferulic acid esters of sterols and triterpene alcohols  <cit> . very little is known about the biosynthesis of γ-oryzanol, even if some pivotal genes involved in the phytosterols biosynthetic pathways have been characterized  <cit> . among these,  <dig> were identified as degs in our comparisons . as a general trend, vol had the highest number of modulated genes for this group:  <dig> and  <dig>  up and down-regulated, respectively, in most of the pair-wise comparisons .

grain size
in addition to the genes affecting grain biometry described above in the cluster session, eight degs identified in the pair-wise comparisons belonged to this category . the negative regulator of grain width gw <dig>   <cit>  was about two times more expressed in car and gv with respect to the other cvs . moreover, car had double expression in most of the comparisons for d <dig> , encoding for a br  insensitive  <dig> -like leucine-rich repeat  receptor kinase regulating seed size affecting brassinosteroid biosynthesis  <cit> . the gif <dig> gene , corresponding to a cell-wall invertase required for carbon partitioning during grain filling which positively affects grain dimensions  <cit> , was two times more expressed in gv, with respect to all the other accessions, and about  <dig> times less transcribed in the medium cv vn in comparison to the long a genotypes. no large variation in expression levels was detected, in our pair-wise comparisons, for the srs <dig> gene  which encodes for an α-tubulin that regulates cell elongation  <cit>  . however, the igv mapping to the nipponbare reference genome underlined that the round seed bal carried a single snp in all the reads mapping at that locus, with respect to the other genotypes , for all the three biological replicates . this mutation corresponds to the polymorphism in exon  <dig> known to be responsible for a small seed size  <cit> . four of the degs involved in grain size  were predicted to undergo to alternative splicing .

transcription factors
in the tfs go term  a total of  <dig> degs were identified, thus representing the richest class of modulated genes in our experiment, with arb vs. vol showing the highest number of loci  and car vs. gv the lowest  . the most representative tf families identified were the wrky superfamily, accounting for  <dig> degs, and the ap <dig> superfamily with  <dig> degs . vn was the genotype displaying an over-all higher expression of wrky tfs in the pair-wise comparisons with fc ranging from about  <dig> to about  <dig>  with respect the other genotypes. examples are loc_os01g <dig> , loc_os05g <dig>  and loc_os05g <dig>  . in general, arb and bal showed the highest expression for the ap <dig> class; by contrast, down-regulation was detected mainly for vol . among the other tfs encoding degs,  <dig> belonged to the mads-box family,  <dig> were homeobox genes,  <dig> of which carried a start domain,  <dig> contained a bzip domain and  <dig> corresponded to zinc finger domain containing proteins  .

time course analysis of selected genes by quantitative real-time pcr
gene expression analyses, by means of quantitative real-time pcr , were conducted at  <dig> time points  for a total of  <dig> loci belonging to the main classes affecting grain quality identified: starch metabolism , ssps  and grain size . rice ubiquitin conjugating enzyme e <dig>  was used as the housekeeping gene. reactions were performed for the three biological replicates for each cv, with three technical replicates each, for all the time-points and results were reported as mean values of the three biological replicates. as control, the same primer pairs utilized for qrt-pcrs were used to amplify the genes from genomic dna of the six cvs . the comparison between rna-seq data and qrt-pcrs at  <dig> daf resulted in a substantial agreement for the differential expression of the genes in the six cvs , validating the rna-seq analysis. the time course expression analysis was performed comparing the transcription levels at  <dig> and  <dig> daf with those at  <dig> daf . the wx gene and the two subunits of agpase resulted more expressed at both  <dig> and  <dig> daf with respect to  <dig> daf, with the highest mrna levels at  <dig> daf for all the cvs excluding the small and round seed bal which showed the highest expression at  <dig> daf . moreover, pair-wise comparisons revealed that the high aac genotypes  had higher expression for wx, with respect to the low aac even at  <dig> and  <dig> daf . the time course expression analyses of the gwd gene  revealed differences among the six varieties: no expression changes were observed at the time-points analyzed for arb, while an increase of the transcription rate was observed from  <dig> to the later maturation stages for gv, vol and bal and a strong decreased expression at  <dig> daf was observed for the two italian risotto varieties car and vn . also for the ssps encoding genes, large variations were observed, with loc_os02g <dig> showing an increasing expression until  <dig> daf and loc_os07g <dig> peaking at  <dig> daf. for the other ssps loci a constant increasing of transcription towards maturation was detected for gv and arb at loc_os12g <dig>  for gv, arb and vol at loc_os12g <dig> and for vol and vn at loc_os07g <dig> . both risbz <dig>  and oswrky <dig>  peaked at  <dig> daf for all the cvs . moreover, loc_os07g <dig> was about two times more expressed in arb with respect to the other long a genotypes  at  <dig> daf . a cv-specific time dependent regulation for loc_os02g <dig>  and loc_os04g <dig>  was observed. for loc_os02g <dig> a peak of expression at  <dig> daf was observed in bal and gv, while higher transcription at  <dig> daf was detected for the other genotypes. for loc_os04g <dig>  all the cvs showed highest mrna levels at  <dig> daf, excluding vn that displayed down-regulation at  <dig> daf .table  <dig> comparison of qrt-pcr fcs in the pair-wise comparisons at  <dig> daf and rna-seq fcs

discussion
recent research studies highlighted that each rice grain qualitative trait is governed by numerous qtls located on different chromosomes , suggesting that the determination of grain quality is the result of a coordinated regulation of multiple factors. the same conclusion was reached by several large scale comparative studies, based on transcriptomic or proteomic analyses, which lead to the identification of biological processes and genetic determinants affecting rice grain properties. a recent deep rna sequencing study conducted on two japonica rice varieties on six days old developing seeds revealed that milling yield and eating quality are the outcome of the coordination of the biosynthesis of starch, eas and ssps  <cit> . moreover, a comparative transcriptomic analysis, performed on rice grains, at  <dig> daf, from two japonica nils, differing for chalkiness, and a proteomic study carried out to identify differential proteins between the bottom chalky part and the upper translucent part of mature grains of a notched-belly rice mutant, underlined that chalkiness is primarily influenced by genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, redox homeostasis and protein synthesis, assembly and degradation  <cit> .

to identify the genetic factors responsible for the differences in kernels traits among italian rice cvs, a transcriptomic comparison of developing grains at  <dig> daf was here conducted on six among the most renowned italian rice varieties, car, vn, arb, vol, bal and gv. pair-wise comparisons associated with co-expression analyses of degs defined a transcriptional fingerprinting of each cv with the detection of clusters of candidate loci responsible for some peculiarities characterizing the six varieties. enriched go terms investigations and literature searches classified the loci belonging to each cluster as being involved in specific pathways previously demonstrated to affect rice grain quality. moreover, a deep analysis of all the degs in the pair-wise comparisons led to the identification of additional candidates implicated in the determination of starch composition, ssps and allergens amounts, nutraceutical compounds biosynthesis, grain-size and gt in the six cvs. in the present work a more extended phenotypic characterization was performed on a set of rice genotypes that present a wider genetic variability than described by previous studies. in fact, the studied genotypes show relevant differences in a number of traits important to quality: grain size, aac, protein content, chalkiness and gt. these differences are reflected in the diverse culinary applications these cv are used for: some  are renowned for the preparation of italian risotto specialties, vol is used for risotto and timbale, bal is used for soups and cakes, whereas gv is an old cv used for breeding because of its resistance to diseases.

regulation of genes involved in grain chalkiness
according to previous results,  <dig> daf is considered a critical time-point for grain filling and for chalkiness determination  <cit> . although with contrasting results, liu et al.   <cit>  and lin et al.   <cit>  stated that a pivotal role in chalkiness determination is attributed to starch and carbohydrate metabolism and in particular to the cell wall biosynthetic processes. in our experiment, degs involved in such pathways were mainly up-regulated in car: genes encoding for cellulose, β-glucan, sss and others positively affecting cell wall biosynthesis were detected for clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  besides to cell wall biosynthetic enzymes or regulators, cellulose catabolic enzymes, like glucosidases, were also present in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> according to the fact that cell walls are subjected to a dynamic remodelling during grain development  <cit> . genes encoding for proteins regulating the biosynthesis and the integrity of cell wall were over-expressed also in arb , vol  and vn . this up-regulation might be responsible for the large chalkiness identified for these four cvs and the highest number of loci belonging to this class over-expressed in car could influenced the appearance of grain as this cv differentiated form the others for showing not only a large lateral chalkiness but also a central one. vn grain appearance could be also associated to the low transcription levels of the positive regulator of grain dimensions, the cell-wall invertase gif <dig>  <cit> , as it was demonstrated that this gene is implicated in chalkiness determination  <cit> . differentially from the other genotypes, vol showed higher transcription of α and β-amylases which action on starch might influence grain appearance  <cit> . moreover, with respect to the other clusters, the vol-specific over-expressed cluster  <dig> contained the highest number of loci implicated in oxidation-reduction processes, like ros scavenging. genes of such type were hypothesized playing central roles in chalkiness determination in rice  <cit> . the co-expression analysis did not reveal a specific over-expression of chalkiness-related loci for bal, suggesting that the small chalkiness detected for this cv is likely associated to the low level of expression of such loci .

transcriptional modulation of protein content-related genes
even protein metabolic processes such as synthesis, folding and degradation assume pivotal functions in grain quality determination. for example, down-regulation of chaperons as bips and pdils, involved in ssps accumulation, were demonstrated to play essential roles in the occurrence of a floury endosperm in rice chalky grains  <cit> . several loci over-expressed in car belonging to cluster  <dig> encoded for chaperons and in particular one was the bip gene. a slightly increasing of the levels of the bip <dig> protein, encoded by this gene, in rice seeds were accompanied by higher amounts of ssps, including glus, in endosperm  <cit>  and, in agreement with these previous observations, the slight up-regulation  of bip correlates with the highest expression of glus encoding genes observed for car that was detected when analyzing all the degs encoding for ssps identified in the pair-wise comparisons. conversely, the lowest levels of ssps in the small and round seed variety bal could be related to a down-regulation of glus encoding genes, as glus represent the 80 % of total ssps in rice kernels. prolms influence on physiochemical properties of rice seeds is not clear, however, experiments carried out for three rice cvs showed that when prolms were added to rice flour there was a reduction in adhesiveness of starch gel  <cit> . among our varieties, vol and gv, having both  <dig>  % of total proteins in seeds, represented the genotypes showing the highest expression of prolms encoding genes. vol showed the highest expression also for key genes promoting prolms accumulation and transcription and encoding for the rbp-b protein  <cit>  and the risbz <dig> bzip tf  <cit> , respectively. several loci implicated in protein synthesis and metabolism were also present in vol up-regulated cluster  <dig>  like a glutamine synthetase, a key enzyme influencing total protein amount in seeds  <cit> . milling head yield is strictly influenced by protein content  <cit>  and chalkiness  <cit> , however, despite the fact that gv and vol had the same percentage of grain proteins and the same appearance, gv showed a lower milling head yield with respect to vol. considering that milling head yield and grain chalkiness are regulated by the coordination of multiple pathways, other factors could contribute to the differences in milling head yield identified for the two cvs. despite the fact that vn and arb displayed the highest total amount of proteins in seeds, they did not show a peculiar over-expression for genes encoding for glus, excluding loc_os02g <dig> for arb, as mentioned in the results section, or prolms. it is likely that the accumulation of ssps in these cvs could occur at different developmental stages than  <dig> daf or that vn and arb kernels are enriched of other classes of proteins. according to this last hypothesis vn showed up-regulation of proteins carrying ltpl domains, identified in plant lipid transfer proteins, trypsin–α-amylase inhibitors and, more interestingly, in ssps  <cit> .

regulation of starch-related genes
cooking properties are primarily influenced by starch composition and specifically by the aac, as low aac grains become glossy and tender after cooking. aac is primarily controlled by the gene wx   <cit> . this gene was more expressed  in the varieties showing the highest aac values  with respect to the others , according to the observation that the amount of amylose in the endosperm is directly proportional to the wx transcription level  <cit> . however, the wx expression in the six genotypes explained only the  <dig>  % of phenotypic variance  in pca analyses performed considering all the genes affecting starch content and composition identified among the degs in the pair-wise comparisons. nonetheless, our previous analysis underlined that a consistent percentage of variance in aac  of  <dig> japonica rice accessions was ascribable to the presence of a g/t snp in the donor splicing site of the leader intron of wx, responsible of a post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . indeed, this snp pinpoints the two main wx alleles characterized: wxa , present in high aac varieties, and wxb , identified in low aac cvs . the presence of the g to t mutation in the wxb allele results in the retention of the first intron and the reduction of the amount of functional enzymes in the endosperm determining low aac phenotypes  <cit> . among the six cvs, wxb was detected for the ones showing the lowest aac values  as they showed the retention of the intron due to the presence of the snp, while the other genotypes, with high aac, carried wxa as a complete splicing was exhibited. by this view, according to our previous analyses  <cit> , the variation in aac detected among our genotypes could be associated to the presence of the two alleles at the wx locus, which not only show a differential splicing but also different expression rates, thus leading to variation in the amount of gbssi functional enzymes in the endosperm.

the only covalent modification of starch is phosphorylation which alters its physical properties and is in part responsible of a sticky grain  <cit> . the reaction is catalyzed by the α-glucan water dikinase  enzyme which transfers the β-phosphate of atp to glycolyl residues of starch  <cit> . in our case, the gwd gene  showed lower expression for the two main italian risotto varieties car and vn, making possible that lower expression of this gene affects the cooking properties of the grains of these two cvs.

another factor affecting rice eating and cooking properties is the gt which depends on the degree of polymerization of amylopectin chains. the main determinant of gt is the ssiia enzyme and, in particular, two functional snps at the level of the ssiia encoding locus were characterized as responsible for low gt: one at + <dig>  bp from the start codon, known to inactivate the ssiia enzyme  <cit> , and the other, at position + <dig> , typical of low gt rice genotypes  <cit> . the low gt old cv gv differentiated from the other varieties for the presence of the first snp, which is quite rare  <cit> . the presence of the second snp was identified in car, vol and bal and could be associated to the low alkali values detected for these varieties. nonetheless, this mutation was also observed in the intermediate gt arb and vn. however, it is important to consider that the control of intermediate gt in rice is still mostly unknown and it has been highlighted that other unknown enzymes play important roles in determining amylopectin chains polymerization  <cit> .

grain size-related genes
grain quality is strictly associated with grain size, which is influenced by a complicate and still poorly understood cooperation of many genes, some of which identified and annotated in rice genome databases  <cit> . considering all the degs in the pair-wise comparisons we could identify candidates that might play pivotal roles in grain size determination for our cvs. the longest size of naked seeds were recorded for car and it could be related to the up-regulation of the positive regulators of grain length d <dig>  wrky <dig> and srs <dig>  <cit>  . moreover the slimmer long a naked grains of car and gv might be associated with the over-expression of the negative regulator of grain width gw <dig>  <cit>  . the down-regulation in vn of the positive regulators of seed dimensions gif <dig>  <cit>  and the large subunit of agpase, positively linked to seed weight  <cit>  , could contribute to the vn medium grain. as indicated for the wx and ssiia loci, the power of rna-seq is not limited to the definition of degs but it is also useful in the detection of putative functional snps. exploiting this possibility, we observed that bal carries a single snp located in exon four of the srs <dig> gene and demonstrated to be responsible of a small and round seed  <cit> , suggesting that this mutation is causal of bal round grain. moreover, this cv showed the highest milling head yield, which could be associated to grain size, as small and round seeds are more resistant to milling with respect to long grains , and to the low level of chalkiness, as chalky grains are more prone to breakage during milling in comparison to vitreous ones  <cit> .

modulation of nutraceutical- and allergens-related genes
rice nutritional quality is also dependent on the content of lipids, which affects storage stability  <cit> , eas, vte components, γ-oryzanol and other nutraceutical compounds. up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism was detected mainly for vol and, interestingly, in vol up-regulated cluster  <dig> we identified a locus encoding for a terpene synthase, a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of γ-oryzanol. however, a linear correlation between transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses was not revealed considering all the degs in the pair-wise comparisons encoding for enzymes involved in tocochromanols and γ-oryzanol biosynthetic pathways. this might be due to an earlier regulation of such genes with respect to  <dig> daf  <cit> . in addition, very little is known about the control of the accumulation of these compounds in seeds and it is also possible that uncharacterized regulators could play essential roles. clusters analyses revealed that vn showed the highest up-regulation of genes encoding for nutritional proteins, or affecting nutraceutical compounds biosynthesis, followed by car, vol and arb. moreover, our results highlighted that each variety showed a peculiar transcriptional regulation of a set of genes related to specific nutraceutical compounds that included glucans for car, thiamins for arb, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids and glicans for vn, thions for bal and flavonols and terpenoids for vol. a cv-specific transcriptional profile was observed even for genes involved in eas biosynthesis, since arb showed up-regulation of loci for trp biosynthesis with respect to the other genotypes, while gv had higher transcription of genes for asp and his biosynthesis. conversely, vol showed the highest up- and down-regulations of degs involved in eas degradation and biosynthesis, respectively. more detailed phenotypic analyses will be necessary to assess whether the different modulation of eas associated genes among our varieties results in different contents of the corresponding eas.

even for loci encoding for known allergens or classes of allergenic proteins, the co-regulation analysis and the detailed searches of all the degs in the pair-wise comparisons revealed a specific transcriptional regulation for each variety. the low seed protein content cv bal represents the genotype carrying the lowest expression for allergens. conversely, higher transcription for cupin domain containing proteins and ltpl encoding genes was detected for vn which showed the highest expression also for genes encoding two known allergens: ossub <dig> and ppg <dig>  some ltpl up-regulation was also detected for car and vol displaying higher transcription also for albumins. moreover, vol showed over-expression for one of the main rice allergens, ral <dig> which accumulates at 15– <dig> daf  <cit> .

integrated analyses and data validation
the co-regulation analysis identified clusters characterized by many genes linked with multiple connections underlining tight relationships. considering this aspect, genes belonging to the same cluster might cooperate together in defining the peculiar characteristics of a certain variety. indeed, analyzing the closest connections inside a cluster, it is possible to hypothesize putative roles for specific genes. as an example, in cluster  <dig>  through the homeobox loc_os01g <dig>  the cellulose synthase cslc <dig>  was tightly associated with the myb tf loc_os05g <dig> and with the c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h zinc finger loc_os03g <dig>  myb tfs are known to regulate cell wall biosynthesis in many species like poplar  <cit> , pinus  <cit> , maize, a. thaliana  and rice, for which osmyb58/ <dig> were recently reported to activate the expression of the cellulose synthase oscesa <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in rice and maize, myb <dig> was demonstrated to activate the cell wall biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  and its homolog in arabidopsis triggers the expression of cellulose synthases directly  <cit>  and indirectly throughout the activation of a c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h zinc finger encoding gene  <cit> . even if loc_os05g <dig> does not correspond to the mybs  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  the tight co-regulation with cslc <dig> and loc_os03g <dig> could suggest a putative role in cell wall biosynthesis regulation for this locus. the same could be hypothesized also for the myb loc_os03g <dig>  which is closely related to the c3hc <dig> type zinc finger loc_os10g <dig> and the trehalose synthase loc_os01g <dig>  in addition, within cluster  <dig>  cell wall biosynthetic enzymes and a feronia receptor kinases, belonging to a class of proteins regulating cell wall biosynthesis  <cit>  as reported above, were tightly transcriptionally co-regulated with signal factors like strubbelig–receptor, mapk, crrlk1l, gata zinc finger and mps, involved in a number of processes like hormone signalling, biotic and abiotic stress response, homeostasis, development and protein-protein interactions . this association might reveal hypothetical involvements of these regulatory genes also in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis.

rna-seq data were confirmed by qrt-pcr analyses and the same patterns of expression of selected loci was observed as those detected in the pair-wise comparisons. duan and sun   <cit>  performed a time course analysis of starch biosynthetic genes in two indica varieties highlighting that transcription of most of them initiate at  <dig> daf, peaked at  <dig> daf and started to decline at  <dig> daf. exceptions to this trend were represented by wx which showed two picks, at  <dig> and  <dig> daf, and by the small subunit of agpase, which peaks at  <dig> daf and then declined slowly towards maturation. in our experiment, wx was more expressed at both  <dig> and  <dig> daf with respect to  <dig> daf, with higher mrna levels at  <dig> daf for all the six cvs. the same behaviour was observed for the other main determinants of starch content in seeds, the two subunits of agpase. our results are however in agreement with the higher expression of wx and agpases observed at  <dig> daf in the japonica cvs analysed by venu and co-workers   <cit> . in addition, qrt-pcr results highlighted a different time-dependent regulation for the α-glucan water dikinase gwd gene  in the two risotto cvs car and vn, with respect to the other genotypes. indeed, the two varieties showed a down-regulation at  <dig> daf while, for the other cvs, an increased gwd expression at  <dig> daf was observed. the regulation of starch phosphorylation, through the modulation of gwd expression, can provide to car and vn peculiar cooking properties to grains. differential time-course expression was found for the ssps encoding genes considered, according to previous analyses revealing that the transcription of ssps-encoding genes is locus-specific, with some peaking at  <dig> daf, and some at  <dig> daf, although maintaining a significant expression activity at late developmental stages  <cit> . moreover, the different transcription patterns for ssps observed among the six varieties suggest a peculiar regulation of specific ssps loci in each cv. more detailed phenotypic assessments of the specific classes of ssps present in the grains of the six accessions are needed to provide a better understanding of the effect of the transcriptional regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
this work represents the first analysis leading to a transcriptional fingerprinting of the most renowned italian rice varieties, providing a gene-expression based picture for most of the grain quality differences observed among the cvs analyzed. the results revealed that each variety is characterized by a peculiar transcriptional regulation of specific sets of genes involved in pathways affecting grain appearance and quality. with respect to the other genotypes, the chalky, long a, high aac caryopsis of car was characterized by a high expression of classes of loci involved in chalkiness determination, like carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis, and of genes encoding for glus, gbssi, gwd, some positive regulators of grain length and the negative regulator of seed width gw2; vol, showing a chalky, long a, low aac grain, was characterized by a high transcription of chalkiness-related loci implicated in cell wall biosynthesis and oxidation-reduction processes and of prolms encoding genes. moreover, this cv displayed low expression for wx and was the genotype carrying the highest modulation of genes implicated in ea biosynthesis and degradation; the vitreous, small and round and low aac seed of bal showed low levels of mrnas of wx, genes implicated in chalkiness determination and loci encoding for allergens and high transcription of a number of defense response genes; for the chalky, medium, high aac vn grain, an high level of expression of wx, gwd and the majority of loci encoding for nutraceutical compounds and allergens was detected. furthermore, vn showed down-regulation of positive regulators of grain size, with respect to most of the other genotypes; gv, carrying a chalky, long a and high aac grain, displayed high transcription of some loci implicated in defense response, the wx gene, loci encoding for prolms or involved in protein metabolism, a class of genes affecting chalkiness; the chalky, long a, low aac grain of arb was characterized by high expression of loci implicated in response to abiotic stress, protein metabolism and redox homeostasis. despite the fact that a complete knowledge of all the factors determining grain quality and how they interact is still missing, a list of candidates affecting the specific grain properties of each variety with respect to the others on the base of differential expression was obtained. moreover, besides the differential transcriptional regulation among the six cvs, putative functional snps associated to specific phenotypic traits were detected. the identification of candidate genes responsible for qualitative traits of the main italian rice varieties offers a starting point for further works aimed to the characterization of loci and molecular markers associated with quality to be used in breeding programs.
