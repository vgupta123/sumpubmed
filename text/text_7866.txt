BACKGROUND
chicken anemia virus  is the member of the genus gyrovirus of the family circoviridae, and the genome consists of a circular single-stranded  <dig>  kb dna molecule  <cit> . cav was first isolated in  <dig> in japan and is the major agent responsible for a disease causing severe anemia and immunosuppression  <cit> . the characteristic symptoms of the disease include aplasia of the bone marrow and the destruction of t lymphoid tissue, which has been shown histopathologically after cav infection  <cit> . generally, cav as the causative agent of chicken anemia disease affects one-day old chicks that lack maternal antibodies  <cit> . mortalities as high as 55% and morbidities as high as 80% have been described when chicks are infected with cav  <cit> .

the cav virion is an icosahedral, nonenveloped and  <dig> nm diameter particle  <cit> . the  <dig>  kb cav genome encodes three viral proteins, vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  <cit> . the vp <dig> protein is the sole structural protein assembled into the cav capsid and has a size of  <dig> kda  <cit> . vp <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein that has phosphatase activity with dual specificity  <cit> . vp <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein that shows apoptotic activity and is able to induces apoptosis within infected chicken cells and human tumor cell lines  <cit> . immunogenicity studies have shown that vp <dig> and vp <dig> are crucial components for the elicitation of host-produced virus neutralizing antibodies in chickens  <cit> . therefore, vp <dig> and vp <dig> have previously been thought to be good candidates for use as immunogens when developing subunit vaccines or diagnostic kits  <cit> . up to the present, several different systems have been developed to express the three cav viral proteins for use in serological tests or for the development of diagnostic elisa kits to detect the presence of cav antibodies  <cit> . in addition, vp <dig> and vp <dig> have been applied as target antigen to generate diagnostic monoclonal antibodies for immunological characterization and for the development of cav detection kits  <cit> . to successfully develop the above areas, the further antigenic characterization of the cav viral proteins is required if a useful diagnostic kit is to be developed. however, so far, the vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins of cav have never been used as antigens to assess comparatively their antigenicity against chicken sera.

in this study, we employed recombinant vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins from cav that were produced using e. coli to characterize their antigenicity with respect to chicken sera; the aim was to assess their usefulness for their possible immunological applications. herein, recombinant vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins were able to be recognized as having high antigenicity using clinical sera samples infected with cav. in addition, various recombinant vp <dig> and vp <dig> truncated subunit proteins were also produced using e. coli and these were then systemically assessed for their antigenicity with respect to chicken sera; the aim being to evaluate the two proteins for potential immunorelevant domains. finally, the productivities of three of the vp <dig> and vp <dig> subunit proteins, namely vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m, were evaluated and compared. using these findings, it was possible to create a vp <dig> subunit based elisa that had high specificity and sensitivity; this has the potential to become a valuable immunological tool for the detection of cav infection.

RESULTS
expression, purification and antigenic characterization of the cav vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins in an e. coli expression system
in order to express cav vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins as antigens for antigenic characterization, the respective recombinant constructs, pvp1-opt, pvp <dig> and pvp3-opt, harboring the cdna of vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  were transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  and e. coli bl21-plyss . these strains were the used to express the various proteins after  <dig> hrs. induction with iptg. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins were successfully expressed in e. coli and produced the correct size bands on coomassie blue gels; these proteins also were recognized by anti-gst tag antibodies . the estimated molecular weight of the induced vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> fusion proteins were  <dig> kda for vp <dig>   <dig> kda for vp <dig> and  <dig> kda for vp <dig> proteins, each of which includes  <dig> kda of the fused gst tag. after affinity chromatography purification, the purified recombinant vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins were determined by sds-page and western-blot analysis . the antigenicities of the purified vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins were then explored by elisa as shown in figure  <dig>  the results were obtained as od <dig> values. the od <dig> values for the cav-positive sera showed that the vp <dig> and vp <dig> protein had higher reactivity than vp <dig> and, furthermore, there were significant differences between the od values for the positive and negative sera . the findings indicate that the vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins exhibit better antigenicity than the vp <dig> protein when cav-positive sera were used to recognize the antigen. thus, for the development of an diagnostic kit, the vp <dig> and vp <dig> protein seem to have considerably better antigenic characteristics and sero-diagnostic potential.

screening and antigenic characterization against chicken sera of vp <dig> and vp <dig> subunit proteins
to optimally establish a cav viral subunit protein-based indirect elisa system, five recombinant vp <dig> subunit proteins and three vp <dig> subunit proteins were produced and expressed in an e. coli expression system; then their reactivity against cav specific-positive sera was analyzed. schematic diagrams of the vp <dig> and vp <dig> subunit proteins are presented in figure  <dig>  three consist of vp <dig> c-terminus deletion mutant proteins , two consist of vp <dig> n-terminus deletion mutant proteins , one is a vp <dig> c-terminus deletion protein, another is a vp <dig> internal domain protein and the last is a n-terminus deletion protein . after construction and expression in e. coli, the sds-page and western blot results confirmed that all of the vp <dig> and vp <dig> subunit proteins were successfully expressed in e. coli . the five vp <dig> subunit proteins  and three vp <dig> subunit proteins  after expression were purified and then evaluated to measure their reactivity against cav-negative and cav-positive specific chicken sera using an elisa approach. all three n-terminal containing vp <dig> subunit proteins, vp2-435n, vp2-396n and vp2-345n, showed better reactivity compared to the two c-terminal containing vp <dig> subunit proteins, vp2-171c and vp2-318c, using  <dig> fold diluted cav specific-positive chicken sera . moreover, when these three n-terminal containing vp <dig> subunit proteins were compared against each other, the antigenic reactivity of vp2-345n and vp2-396n were higher than that of vp2-435n . in contrast, among the three vp <dig> subunit proteins, only subunit vp3-246m was demonstrated to be highly antigenic and show a significant difference in od <dig> value between the cav specific-positive   . thus, based on the above findings, only two purified vp <dig> subunit proteins, 345n and 396n, together with one vp <dig> subunit protein, 246m, show characteristics suggesting that they contain major immunorelevant domains from either vp <dig> or vp <dig>  such subunit proteins have high potential as coating antigens for use in the sero-diagnosis of cav infection or in other immunological applications.

diagnostic application of an elisa based system using vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m for the detection of cav infection
to evaluate the possible clinical application of the vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m proteins for the diagnosis of cav infection, these three cav viral subunit proteins were used in a cav infection testing system. as shown as in figure  <dig>  when  <dig> cav specific-positive and  <dig> cav-negative chicken sera were analyzed using this approach, high antigenicity was demonstrated and there were significant differences in od <dig> values between the cav specific-positive and negative sera  using vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m as coating antigens . this indicated that the vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m subunit proteins are highly antigenic and are able to discriminate chicken sera that have been cav infected from those that have not been infected. next, the  <dig> cav negative chicken sera were tested against vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m and the individual od <dig> value as shown in figure 6a-c were averaged to determine a positive threshold. positive/negative cut-off values were determined as either the mean plus two standard deviations  or as the mean plus three standard deviations  . using the mean+2sd as the cut-off value, the vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m based elisas all produced  <dig> % specificity. when the mean+3sd was used as the cut-off value, the specificities of the vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m based elisas were all raised to 100% . the sensitivities of the vp2-396n, vp2-345n and vp3-246m based elisa were also determined and found to be 100%  for vp2-396n, 100%  for vp2-345n and 90%  for vp3-246m, when the cut-off values were set at the mean+2sd. . however, the sensitivities all decreased when the mean+3sd was applied as the cut-off value. in the latter circumstances, the sensitivities of the vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m based elisas were determined to be  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and 85%  , respectively.

a: the percentage of specificity was determined from the numbers of od <dig> value below cut-off values in the total elisa results with  <dig> negative cav-infected sera.

b: the percentage of sensitivity was determined from the numbers of od <dig> value higher cut-off values in the total elisa results with  <dig> positive cav-infected sera.

discussion
in this study, we have successfully produced in e. coli vp <dig> protein, vp <dig> protein, vp <dig> protein as well as a series of vp <dig> and vp <dig> subunit proteins in order to evaluate their antigenicity with respect to specific cav-positive chicken sera. after assessment of their antigenicity against chicken sera, the vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins were demonstrated to have higher antigenicity than the vp <dig> protein. in previous reports, vp <dig> and vp <dig> protein have been shown to elicit virus neutralizing antibodies in the host  <cit> . thus, vp <dig> and vp <dig> were thought to be good candidates as immunogens for vaccine development or diagnostic application. however, the present antigenic analysis indicates that cav vp <dig> protein may not be that useful in serological tests. during cav infection, vp <dig> and vp <dig> are detected in chicken cells within  <dig> hours post-infection, while vp <dig> is only detected at  <dig> hours post-infection  <cit> . this phenomenon indicates that the titers of antibodies against cav viral proteins produced in the chicken sera might have different levels that correspond to either exposure time or to the amount of viral protein present in the infected chicken. at present, there are no reports available that describe the igg titer profiles in the chicken sera against the vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins. thus, a lower titer of anti-vp <dig> igg in chicken sera might be present and this would result in a lower antigenicity when tested by elisa.

using a subunit protein rather than an intact virion as coating antigen during the development of serological test has some advantages; these include cost-effectiveness, time-saving and ease of antigen production. indeed, currently, the greatest problem when developing a serological assay is identifying, obtaining and preparing a suitable antigen. this is especially true if intact virion or viral protein/antigen purified from virus-infected tissue or from cell culture is used. this is because these require tedious processing, including the concentration of supernatant from infected culture medium by continuous zonal centrifugation or by peg precipitation. moreover, the source of coating antigen is a crucial consideration when performing large-scaled antigen production. therefore, using a recombinant subunit protein for serodiagnosis would be much simpler. up to the present, there have been no reports describing post-translational modification of the native cav vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins. based on this, in the present study, we used a prokaryotic expression system to produce recombinant cav antigens. by direct engineering of the vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins it was possible to product truncated subunit proteins that are more convenient and seem to be more suitable and more efficient than proteins produced by an insect-baculovirus system or by a transgenic plant approach  <cit> . when the productivities in e. coli of the recombinant vp <dig> and vp <dig> subunit proteins were evaluated, the highest expression levels of the vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m proteins, both soluble and insoluble, in e. coli whole cell lysate after iptg induction for  <dig> hrs. were determined to be  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig> mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l , respectively. in addition, a growth profile analysis of these three e. coli strains showed that the vp3-246m expressing strain had the fastest growth rate at  <dig> hours cultivation after iptg induction when the three recombinant strains were compared . the growth profiles of the vp2-345n and vp2-396n expressing strains in e. coli were almost identical. these findings suggest that production of the vp3-246m protein in e. coli will be the most efficient.

using an antigenic peptide prediction bioinformatics software program , the antigenic propensities of vp <dig> and vp <dig> were analyzed . seven antigenic determinants were predicted to be present in the vp <dig> protein and these spanned amino acid residues 29- <dig> , 56- <dig> , 77- <dig> , 104- <dig> , 119- <dig> , 137- <dig>  and 195- <dig> . only four antigenic determinants were predicted to be present in the vp <dig> protein and these peptides spanned amino acid residues 11- <dig> , 24- <dig> , 34- <dig>  and 86- <dig> . thus vp2-435n consists of at least six antigenic determinants. however, the antigenic reactivity of vp2-435n was lower than that of vp2-345n and vp2-396n . the result of these expressed recombinant proteins might not be correctly folfed to that of the native protein; in such circumstances all of the antigenic regions of the subunit protein might not be exposed completely on the protein surface. moreover, higher immunoreactivity was observed with the n-terminal containing vp <dig> subunit proteins, which suggests that there are functional antigenic sites located within the n-terminal region of this protein. in a previous study, a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the cav vp <dig> protein across the different cav isolates available in the genbank demonstrated extremely high identity between these isolates  <cit> . in such circumstances, n-terminal containing vp <dig> subunit proteins containing discriminating immunorelevant epitopes should be useful when developing subunit protein-based elisas for the detection of cav specific antibodies.

vp3-123n has at three predicted antigenic determinants, which contrast with vp3-246m, which has only one predicted antigenic determinant; nevertheless, the antigenic reactivity of vp3-246m was found to be higher than that of the other vp <dig> subunit proteins, vp3-123n and vp3-366c. this may indicate that the central domain of the vp <dig> protein, vp3-246m, is a major factor in antigenic recognition. taking the above results together, the findings suggest that vp2-345n, vp2-396n, vp2-435n and vp3-246m all seems to be structurally and antigenically very similar to their native protein, at least to some degree . consequently, our findings demonstrate that the above vp <dig> and vp <dig> subunit proteins are likely to be good candidates for sero-diagnostic application in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
this is first report to describe the expression, purification and systematically antigenic characterization of cav viral proteins. engineered subunit proteins, vp2-345n, vp2-396n and vp3-246m, are likely to be more useful in sero-diagnostic kits for cav antibodies detection than the full-length native vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins. this is because they should be cost-effectiveness as well as having high antigenicity; they thus ought to be useful as coating antigens when used in immune-enzymatic systems.
