BACKGROUND
epithelial-mesenchymal transition  is a critical process in the formation of the valves and septa of the heart. prior to the onset of emt, endocardial cushions form in the atrioventricular canal  and outflow tract  regions when localized deposition of extracellular matrix separates the endocardial lining from the myocardial wall of the heart tube. in response to inductive signals from the adjacent myocardium, a subset of endocardial cells within the avc and oft cushions undergoes emt and invades the cushion matrix  <cit> . fusion and remodeling of the cellularized cushions in the avc gives rise to the mitral and tricuspid valves, and in the oft to the aortic and pulmonary valves. dysregulation of emt or subsequent remodeling of the cushion mesenchyme can cause valve and septal malformations  <cit> , which can range from mild to life threatening.

endocardial cell emt can be separated into two distinct events: activation, in which cell polarity and cell-cell contacts are lost, and invasion, in which the transformed mesenchymal cells migrate into the matrix. in the chick, both steps are induced by members of the transforming growth factor β  family. tgfβ <dig> is required for activation, while tgfβ <dig> is required for invasion  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> and tgfβ <dig> are both expressed in the underlying myocardium prior to mesenchyme formation  <cit> . in contrast, tgfβ <dig> is expressed in the cushion endocardium only during stages of active mesenchyme formation  <cit> . although secreted signals from the avc and oft myocardium have been shown to induce endocardial cell emt  <cit> , it has also been demonstrated that an autocrine tgfβ <dig> signal is required for endocardial cell transformation into invasive mesenchyme  <cit> . this autocrine signal likely provides amplification or propagation of tgfβ <dig> signaling within the endocardium, perhaps activated by the myocardium.

muscleblind-like  <dig>  is a known regulator of pre-mrna alternative splicing in the developing heart, driving fetal-to-adult transitions in alternative splicing  <cit> . mbnl <dig> has also recently been shown to regulate the stability of some mrna targets  <cit> . we previously reported that mbnl <dig> is differentially expressed in the embryonic heart during endocardial cushion development  <cit> . within the endocardial cushions, mbnl <dig> is highly expressed in the endocardium, but is low or absent from the underlying myocardium and invaded mesenchymal cells. in contrast, outside of the cushion regions mbnl <dig> is found in the myocardium but not the endocardium. knockdown of mbnl <dig> in hamburger and hamilton  stage  <dig> embryonic chicken avc explants with either of two independent sirnas enhanced invasion, whereas a control non-targeting sirna and an sirna directed against an unrelated splicing factor had no effect  <cit> . we demonstrated that this enhancement of invasion in response to mbnl <dig> knockdown is tgfβ3-dependent, but the basis for this dependence had not yet been determined.

in this study, we investigate the relationship between mbnl <dig> and tgfβ <dig> in the avc and oft cushions. we provide evidence that knockdown of mbnl <dig> leads to precocious and elevated endocardial-derived tgfβ <dig> levels in avc explants, and that early exposure to excess tgfβ <dig> leads to precocious and elevated levels of mesenchymal cell invasion. likewise, tgfβ is necessary and sufficient to stimulate excess invasion in response to mbnl <dig> depletion in oft explants. taken together, these data support a model in which mbnl <dig> acts as a negative regulator of endocardial cushion emt by restricting the timing and amount of autocrine tgfβ <dig> production in the avc and oft endocardium.

RESULTS
enhancement of cell invasion in the avc by mbnl <dig> knockdown is dependent on tgfβ3
tgfβ <dig> is required for avc mesenchyme invasion  <cit> . this requirement is not abrogated by loss of mbnl <dig>  we previously demonstrated that the enhancement of cell invasion induced by knockdown of mbnl <dig> in stage  <dig> avc explants can be blocked by inhibitory antibodies against tgfβs, in particular tgfβ <dig>  <cit> . in those experiments the tgfβ-neutralizing antibodies were added at six hours. at this time point, blocking tgfβ effectively abolishes emt in control as well as sirna-treated explants. it is therefore unclear whether mbnl <dig> acts through tgfβ <dig>  or merely that tgfβ <dig> signaling is required to initiate the process of invasion, which is then acted on by mbnl <dig> at a later step. to address this, we added anti-tgfβ neutralizing antibodies to mock- or mbnl <dig> sirna-treated stage  <dig> avc explants eighteen hours after explantation . at this time, addition of a pan anti-tgfβ antibody that inhibits tgfβ <dig>  - <dig>  and − <dig> had no effect on invasion in control explants, indicating that the requirement for tgfβ signaling to induce basal levels of invasion has passed, presumably because sufficient inductive signal has already been received. this is consistent with a previous study that showed anti-tgfβ <dig> antibodies have progressively less inhibitory effect on invasion in avc explants taken from progressively later stages, suggesting that over time an increasing number of cushion endocardial cells pass the critical requirement for tgfβ <dig>  <cit> . inhibition of tgfβ did abrogate the increase in invasion induced by anti-mbnl <dig> sirna treatment, however, suggesting that the effects of mbnl <dig> knockdown remain dependent on tgfβ signaling. an anti-tgfβ <dig> inhibitory antibody likewise reduced invasion to control levels in mbnl <dig> sirna-treated explants. the requirement for tgfβ <dig> is specific, as levels of invasion remained elevated in mbnl1-depleted explants in the presence of an anti-tgfβ <dig> inhibitory antibody.

knockdown of mbnl <dig> enhances autocrine tgfβ <dig> in the avc endocardium
one possible explanation for the continued dependence on tgfβ <dig> for the enhancement of invasion in mbnl <dig> sirna-treated explants is that loss of mbnl <dig> leads to an increase in tgfβ <dig>  to determine whether tgfβ <dig> levels are affected by mbnl <dig> knockdown, secreted tgfβ protein levels were compared in conditioned media collected from mock- and mbnl <dig> sirna-treated stage  <dig> avc explants by elisa . medium from sirna-treated explants contained approximately twice as much tgfβ <dig> as medium from control explants. in contrast, tgfβ <dig> levels were similar in media from mbnl1-depleted and control explants.

within the avc, tgfβ <dig> is expressed in the myocardium before, during, and after emt takes place, but is not expressed in active form in the endocardium until the onset of invasion  <cit> . mbnl <dig> is highly expressed in the avc endocardium, but is not detected in the underlying myocardium  <cit> . to ascertain whether the increase in tgfβ <dig> secretion in mbnl1-depleted avc explants is endocardially-derived, tgfβ <dig> levels were compared in conditioned media collected from mock- and mbnl <dig> sirna-treated stage  <dig> avc explants in which the myocardium was removed . as in intact explants, secreted tgfβ <dig> levels were elevated in mbnl1-depleted avc explants lacking the myocardium, indicating loss of mbnl <dig> has a cell-autonomous effect on autocrine tgfβ <dig> production in the endocardium. it may be noted that tgfβ <dig> levels are elevated in mbnl1-depleted avc endocardia to a lesser extent than in intact mbnl1-depleted avc explants. this could indicate a contribution of increased paracrine tgfβ <dig> production resulting from a non-cell-autonomous effect of mbnl1-depleted endocardium on the myocardium. this discrepancy may also result from a reduction in the endocardial cell population in the absence of the myocardium. cardiomyocyte-conditioned medium has been shown to induce proliferation in avc endocardial monolayers  <cit> . indeed, the size of the endocardial monolayer, number of activated endocardial cells, and amount of invaded mesenchyme were significantly reduced in both control and sirna-treated avc endocardia relative to similarly treated intact avc explants .

to further confirm that tgfβ <dig> levels are elevated in endocardial cells following mbnl <dig> knockdown, immunofluorescence was performed on mock- and sirna-transfected stage  <dig> avc explants using an anti-tgfβ <dig> antibody. in control explants, tgfβ3-positive cells were detected within the endocardial monolayer . this is consistent with the detection of active tgfβ <dig> in scattered cells within the avc endocardium during stages of active emt  <cit> . in agreement with our elisa data, more tgfβ3-positive cells were detected within the endocardial monolayers of mbnl1-depeleted explants than controls .

in some cases, mbnl <dig> binding to the 3' untranslated region of a target mrna can promote mrna decay, and loss of mbnl <dig> can increase transcript half-life  <cit> . to determine whether the increase in tgfβ <dig> levels following mbnl <dig> knockdown is due to an increase in tgfβ <dig> transcripts, rna was collected from the non-myocardial cells in mock and mbnl <dig> sirna-treated stage  <dig> avc explants and tgfβ <dig> levels were measured by real time rt-pcr . despite a doubling in secreted tgfβ <dig> protein levels, steady state tgfβ <dig> transcript levels exhibited no difference in mbnl1-depleted explants relative to controls. this indicates that the effects of mbnl <dig> on tgfβ <dig> levels are post-transcriptional, acting at the level of protein production, stability, or processing.

addition of exogenous tgfβ <dig> is sufficient to recapitulate the effects of mbnl <dig> knockdown in avc explants
tgfβ <dig> is necessary and sufficient to induce invasion in responsive avc endocardial monolayers in the absence of the myocardium  <cit> . supplementation with additional exogenous tgfβ <dig> protein has been shown to induce increased expression of mesenchymal markers in intact chick avc explants  <cit> , but whether or not exposure to extra tgfβ <dig> would also lead to increased levels of invasion has not been reported. to determine whether the presence of extra tgfβ <dig> protein is sufficient to enhance cell invasion, stage  <dig> avc explants were treated with different doses of recombinant tgfβ <dig> protein. a trend towards increased cell invasion was observed, nearly doubling at the highest dose tested .

although the maximum level of invasion observed is comparable to that seen in mbnl1-depleted explants, the dose required to produce this effect  is one to two orders of magnitude higher than what has been shown to induce mesenchymal marker expression in avc explants and endocardial monolayers  <cit> . to evaluate the induction of mesenchymal marker expression, total rna was harvested from non-myocardial cells of stage  <dig> avc explants following rtgfβ <dig> treatment over a similar dose range. transcript levels for smooth muscle β-actin  and fibrillin  <dig> , two emt markers known to be induced by tgfβ <dig>  <cit> , were assessed by real-time rt-pcr . both acta <dig> and fbn <dig> transcripts were induced at all doses tested. this indicates that higher doses of tgfβ <dig> are necessary to induce invasion than to activate mesenchymal gene expression, and that the expression of mesenchymal genes is not sufficient to drive invasion. consistent with this, nakajima and colleagues previously reported a dose-dependent induction of smooth muscle β-actin protein-positive cells by  <dig> to  <dig> ng/ml rtgfβ <dig> in avc endocardial monolayers without acquisition of an invasive phenotype  <cit> .

loss of mbnl <dig> induces precocious tgfβ <dig>  and early exposure to excess tgfβ <dig> induces precocious invasion
since tgfβ <dig> is transiently expressed in the avc endocardium  <cit> , the increase in tgfβ <dig> levels following mbnl <dig> knockdown could be explained in part by a change in the timing, and not just the levels, of tgfβ <dig> production. for example, in the absence of mbnl <dig> endocardial cells may begin secreting tgfβ <dig> prematurely, allowing more to accumulate. alternatively, loss of mbnl <dig> may allow tgfβ <dig> production in the endocardium to continue longer than normal. to determine when tgfβ <dig> levels become elevated in mbnl1-depleted explants, we performed a time course experiment . after a short attachment period and sirna boost, medium was added to mock- and sirna-transfected stage  <dig> avc explants. the media were replaced with fresh medium every  <dig> hours until four conditioned supernatants were collected for each. secreted tgfβ <dig> levels were then compared for each time point between control and mbnl1-depleted explants. tgfβ <dig> levels were not detectable above low baseline levels in the medium alone in control explants until the third twelve-hour window. in contrast, in mbnl1-depleted explants, tgfβ <dig> levels were above the baseline at all time points, and were significantly higher than those of control explants during the first  <dig> hours. this suggests that loss of mbnl <dig> not only leads to elevated levels of tgfβ <dig> secretion, but also precocious tgfβ <dig> secretion. in contrast, during the last  <dig> hours tgfβ <dig> levels went down in mbnl1-depleted supernatants and were similar to those in the control supernatants. this may suggest that mbnl <dig> is not required for the down-regulation of autocrine tgfβ <dig> production at later stages of cushion development.

precocious production of tgfβ <dig> may in turn be predicted to promote precocious mesenchyme production. to determine whether early exposure to excess tgfβ <dig> will induce precocious invasion, stage  <dig> avc explants were treated with recombinant tgfβ <dig> protein and fixed at earlier stages of culture . the mean number of invaded cells was significantly higher in rtgfβ3-treated explants than controls at both  <dig> and  <dig> hours. at  <dig> hours, only one of  <dig> control explants had significant levels of invasion , a fraction of the total population  that does not statistically differ from an expected value of 0% by z test . in contrast, over 40% of rtgfβ3-treated explants had significant numbers of invaded cells , some with ten or more invaded cells. at  <dig> hours, about half of control explants had significant invasion, only a few of which had more than eight invaded cells. in contrast, more than 85% of tgfβ3-treated explants had significant levels of invasion, and a third had more than  <dig> invaded cells. these results indicate that premature exposure to tgfβ <dig> does indeed induce precocious as well as an increased level of invasion.

mbnl <dig> expression precedes tgfβ <dig> in the avc
if mbnl <dig> limits invasion by preventing precocious tgfβ <dig> expression in the avc endocardium, then its expression must precede that of tgfβ <dig> in avc endocardial cells. although tgfβ <dig> is produced in the myocardium as early as stage  <dig>  active tgfβ <dig> protein is not detectable in the avc endocardium until stages 17– <dig>  commensurate with emt  <cit> . we previously reported that mbnl <dig> transcripts are abundant in avc endocardium at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , but the expression of mbnl <dig> prior to the onset of emt had not been evaluated. to determine whether mbnl <dig> is expressed in the avc endocardium at earlier stages, in situ hybridization was performed on sagittal sections from stage  <dig> and  <dig> chick embryos. similar to what was observed at later stages  <cit> , mbnl <dig> transcripts were strongly detected in endocardial cells within the avc at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  but were low or absent in endocardial cells within the atrium and ventricle . strong mbnl <dig> signal is also detected in blood cells. adjacent sections processed in parallel and hybridized with mbnl <dig> sense probes had no detectable signal . there are far fewer avc endocardial cells at stages 15– <dig> than at later stages. to determine the relative level of mbnl <dig> expression at different stages, the avc region was excised from stages  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hearts, total rna was harvested, and mbnl <dig> levels were quantitated by real-time rt-pcr . mbnl <dig> transcripts were detected in the avc at stage  <dig>  consistent with positive staining in the heart in stage  <dig> embryos subjected to whole mount in situ hybridization  <cit> . the level of mbnl <dig> increased at stage  <dig>  and then remained at a steady level in the avc through stage  <dig>  together, these data indicate that mbnl <dig> expression does indeed precede the activation of autocrine tgfβ <dig> expression in the avc endocardium, consistent with our model.

enhancement of invasion by mbnl <dig> knockdown is stage-dependent in avc explants
to determine whether avc endocardium from later stages would respond differently to loss of mbnl <dig>  invasion was compared in avc explants from stage  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transfected with control or mbnl <dig> sirnas . as was seen previously  <cit> , knockdown of mbnl <dig> with either of two independent anti-mbnl <dig> sirnas in stage  <dig> avc explants resulted in increased cell invasion. knockdown in stage  <dig> avc explants also enhanced invasion, whereas knockdown in stage  <dig> explants had no significant effect. strikingly, the level of invasion induced by loss of mbnl <dig> in stage  <dig> explants was reminiscent of levels observed for controls at stage  <dig>  and likewise knockdown in stage  <dig> explants resulted in levels similar to stage  <dig> controls. these results are consistent with accelerated induction of invasion. the extent of invasion in mbnl <dig> sirna-treated explants from any stage did not exceed that of the normal level at stage  <dig>  the lack of response in stage  <dig> explants is consistent with the normalization of tgfβ <dig> levels in the last window of the time course in figure  <dig>  and may suggest that while loss of mbnl <dig> stimulates precocious production of tgfβ <dig>  once autocrine tgfβ <dig> is expressed mbnl <dig> no longer regulates its function.

loss of mbnl <dig> enhances tgfβ-dependent invasion in oft explants
as in the avc, endocardial cells within the oft cushions express high levels of mbnl <dig> transcript  <cit> . to determine whether mbnl <dig> plays a similar role in emt in the oft, mbnl <dig> was knocked down in oft explants from stage  <dig> hearts and the extent of activation and invasion were assessed . the results were strikingly similar to those observed in avc explants. either of the two independent sirnas against mbnl <dig> stimulated an increase in the number of invaded cells, but had no significant effect on activation. a control sirna had no effect on activation or invasion.

oft endocardial cells and explants also express tgfβ <dig> coincident with active emt  <cit> . to determine whether the effects of loss of mbnl <dig> in the oft are also tgfβ-dependent, a pan anti-tgfβ neutralizing antibody was used to inhibit tgfβ signaling in mock- or mbnl <dig> sirna-treated stage  <dig> oft explants. at six hours, the anti-tgfβ antibody had no effect on the basal level of invasion in control explants, but it inhibited the enhancement of invasion following mbnl <dig> knockdown . to determine whether supplemental tgfβ <dig> protein is sufficient to induce increased cell invasion in the oft as well, stage  <dig> oft explants were treated with recombinant tgfβ <dig> protein. as in the avc, the addition of exogenous rtgfβ <dig> stimulated invasion . together, these results indicate that tgfβ is both necessary and sufficient for the enhancement of cell invasion in response to loss of mbnl <dig> protein in the oft.

discussion
autocrine production of tgfβ <dig> is required for conversion of avc endocardial cells to invasive mesenchyme  <cit> . furthermore, tgfβ <dig> is necessary and sufficient to induce expression of mesenchymal markers in chick avc explants  <cit> . here we demonstrate:  the ability of mbnl <dig> knockdown to stimulate invasion in stage  <dig> avc explants is dependent on tgfβ <dig>   endocardial-derived tgfβ <dig> is secreted early and at elevated levels following mbnl <dig> knockdown,  early exposure to excess tgfβ <dig> induces precocious and elevated levels of mesenchymal cell invasion, and  mbnl <dig> expression precedes that of tgfβ <dig> in the avc endocardium. together, these data support a model in which mbnl <dig> limits mesenchyme formation by restricting the onset and level of autocrine tgfβ <dig> production in the cushion endocardium. after stage  <dig>  endocardial cells within the cushions begin to produce both active tgfβ <dig> protein and invasive mesenchyme  <cit> . strikingly, knockdown of mbnl <dig> had no effect on invasion in stage  <dig> avc explants, congruous with the idea that mbnl <dig> prevents the onset of tgfβ <dig> expression in the endocardium, but not its efficacy once activated.

the autocrine production of tgfβ <dig> in the cushion endocardium requires a signal from the myocardium  <cit> . addition of exogenous tgfβ <dig> has been found to promote invasion in stage  <dig> avc endocardial monolayers, abrogating the need for additional inductive signals from the myocardium  <cit> . we found that addition of exogenous tgfβ <dig> promoted the production of invasive mesenchyme in stage  <dig> avc explants within  <dig> hours of culture. these results suggest that it is the activation of tgfβ <dig> expression in the endocardium, not acquisition of responsiveness to tgfβ <dig> signaling, that is the key event that regulates the onset of invasion. although our model proposes that mbnl <dig> prevents premature activation of tgfβ <dig> in cushion endocardial cells, mbnl <dig> continues to be expressed in the avc and oft endocardium at stages when tgfβ <dig> expression and cellularization of the cushions are well underway  <cit> . one possibility is that a myocardial signal is required not to direct the production of tgfβ <dig> per se, but rather to alleviate its repression by mbnl <dig>  a variety of factors secreted by the myocardium have been implicated in the induction of emt, including tgfβs, bone morphogenetic proteins , vascular endothelial growth factor , hepatocyte growth factor , a 130-kda protein  subsequently identified as a ribosome binding protein  <dig> homolog , and extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronan  <cit> . there is currently no known connection between any of these inductive factors and mbnl <dig>  nor has a direct link been demonstrated between any of these and the autocrine production of tgfβ <dig> in the endocardium.

an important area of future investigation is to determine the mechanism by which mbnl <dig> prevents  tgfβ <dig> expression in cushion endocardial cells. we found no change in the steady state levels of tgfβ <dig> transcripts following mbnl <dig> knockdown in avc endocardial cells. we also found no evidence of alternative splicing of tgfβ <dig> transcripts , indicating regulation of tgfβ <dig> occurs at the protein level. tgfβ proteins are produced and secreted in latent complexes that are activated in vivo by proteolytic cleavage  <cit> . using antibodies that specifically recognize only active or active and latent tgfβ isoforms, one study reported that while active tgfβ <dig> is detectable in cushion endocardium and mesenchyme beginning at stage  <dig>  some latent tgfβ <dig> is found in the avc and oft endocardium at stages 14– <dig>  <cit> . latent tgfβ-binding proteins  are thought to be important for storage and proteolysis-mediated release of tgfβ from the latent complex, perhaps by concentrating tgfβ at the cell surface  <cit> . a regulatory role for ltbp- <dig> in endocardial cushion emt has been identified in mice  <cit> . the release of active tgfβ proteins from latent complexes can be mediated by several proteases, including plasmin and thrombospondin  <cit> . annexin ii is expressed in stage  <dig> endocardial cells, and facilitates plasmin production that subsequently releases active tgfβ <dig> in chick avc explants  <cit> . mbnl <dig> could act directly on the pre-mrna alternative splicing or mrna stability of one or more of these factors, or act indirectly on tgfβ <dig> activation by regulating the expression or activity of an upstream regulator of this pathway.

although a role in tgfβ <dig> activation is plausible, it is also possible that loss of mbnl <dig> leads to an increase in protein production, secretion, or stability. in our elisa experiments we investigated only the amount of tgfβ proteins secreted into the media, and the antibodies we used for detection in the elisa and immunofluorescence experiments only recognize the activated tgfβ isoforms. ongoing studies to identify the direct molecular targets of mbnl <dig> in the cushion endocardium will be informative in resolving the mechanism by which mbnl <dig> acts on tgfβ <dig> expression.

although our studies have focused primarily on the role of mbnl <dig> in regulating endocardial cell invasion in the avc, our data suggest mbnl <dig> plays a similar role in the oft cushions. knockdown of mbnl <dig> in stage  <dig> oft explants enhanced invasion, and tgfβ was necessary and sufficient for this effect. autocrine tgfβ <dig> is also produced by oft endocardium, first as a latent protein and then in active form  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> has been implicated in inducing emt during the development of other organ systems in the chick embryo as well, including fusion of the palate  <cit>  and outgrowth of limb bud mesenchyme  <cit> . strikingly, mbnl <dig> is expressed in the pharyngeal arches and limb buds in both mouse  <cit>  and chicken embryos , raising the possibility that regulating the level and timing of tgfβ signals may be a general and conserved role of mbnl <dig> in the developing embryo.

CONCLUSIONS
autocrine tgfβ <dig> production is important for the formation of invasive mesenchyme from endocardial cells in the atrioventricular canal and outflow tract cushions. mbnl <dig> is expressed in cushion endocardial cells prior to activation of autocrine tgfβ <dig>  and knockdown of mbnl <dig> leads to early and elevated levels of endocardially-derived tgfβ <dig> production and mesenchymal cell invasion. we therefore propose that the role of mbnl <dig> in the endocardial cushions is to limit the amount of invasive mesenchyme by regulating the timing and level of tgfβ <dig> signaling.
