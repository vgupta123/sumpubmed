BACKGROUND
deer mice  and other peromyscine species are the most abundant mammals in north america and found from the sub-arctic to mexico
 <cit> . the deer mouse genome has recently been sequenced to 7x depth but it has not yet been annotated, which presents difficulties for leveraging it as a resource. the genus hosts a number of pathogens, including the agents that cause granulocytic ehrlichiae , lyme disease , babesiosis , cryptosporidia , bartenellosis , cutaneous leishmaniasis in mexico and central america , deer tick virus, powassan virus, and sin nombre  and new york- <dig>  hantaviruses 
 <cit> . these diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality in north and central america each year, and some are important agricultural pathogens. despite the importance of this genus as reservoirs and vectors, little is known about the immunology of peromyscines.

hantaviruses are tri-segmented negative-stranded viruses hosted by rodents or insectivores
 <cit> . several pathogenic hantaviruses, which are rodent-borne, cause hcps in the americas or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome  in eurasia, both of which have prominent immunopathologic components. the two most important hcps-causing hantaviruses are snv, hosted by the north american deer mouse, and andes virus , hosted by the south american long-tailed pygmy rice rat . reservoirs remain persistently-infected, without pathology, despite mounting an immune response that generates high-titer neutralizing antibodies within one to two months after infection
 <cit> .

the presence of virus-specific igg antibodies in reservoir rodents infected with their hantaviruses suggests a prominent role for helper t cell -mediated class switching and affinity maturation. several th cell subsets have been identified that provide distinct effector functions that mediate host responses to pathogens
 <cit> . these cells are distinguished by epigenetic expression of specific cytokines, cell surface antigens and transcription factors that results in limited plasticity after differentiation
 <cit> . while these factors have been exhaustively examined in the commonly-used laboratory house mouse , virtually no work has been conducted on natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, thus, it is not clear how the coevolutionary adaptations between these viruses and their reservoir hosts have influenced the host responses mediated by helper t cells.

spillover from natural reservoirs to other rodent species has occasionally been observed in nature. pinion mice  are naturally susceptible to snv
 <cit>  but it is unknown if they develop disease, or if they clear the virus or remain persistently infected. deer mice are experimentally susceptible to andv infection without disease; however, unlike snv infection they clear andv
 <cit> . this dichotomous outcome provides an opportunity to study how persistence or clearance occurs in a reservoir host species. the lack of peromyscine-specific reagents has limited the experimental value of deer mice; however, the availability of its genome presents a substantial opportunity for examination of the host response. we devised a computational method to parse the unannotated deer mouse genome for “virtual cdnas” of interest, which were then used to generate primers for real-time pcr arrays to assess gene expression in lymph node cell cultures from deer mice experimentally infected with andes virus.

RESULTS
pcr array
we developed software that uses blast of fasta-formatted cdna sequences against sequences from the deer mouse genome to identify and assemble exons and untranslated regions into virtual deer mouse cdnas . we submitted the sequences of  <dig> house mouse  genes involved in antiviral, innate and adaptive immune responses to the software. the software identified deer mouse orthologs for all of the  <dig> submitted house mouse immune genes. these deer mouse sequences were then piped to primer <dig> software for identification of real-time pcr primer candidates
 <cit> . primer candidates for the great majority of deer mouse sequences were identified; however, five genes  failed to produce candidate primers using our stringent parameters for real-time pcr. il <dig> expression is a marker of th <dig> cells, thus its absence prevented us from identifying this phenotype. one primer pair  produced two products on melt curve analysis and was excluded from the array. the remaining primer pairs amplified single products on melt curve analysis from total rna collected from concanavalin a-stimulated deer mouse splenocytes and were used with primers from our previous work
 <cit>  to produce a 94-gene pcr array .

expression profiles of deer mouse lymph node cell cultures
fourteen days after inoculation with andv, the six deer mice  were anesthetized and bled for serology, then euthanized to retrieve cervical lymph nodes, which respond to respiratory infections and are a rich source of antigen presenting cells and virus-specific t cells and b cells. lymph nodes were not recovered from one deer mouse , thus no data are presented for this animal. lymph nodes from the remaining five deer mice were made into single cell suspensions and were plated with or without 10 μg of recombinant andv nucleocapsid antigen. seventy-two hours later, conspicuous lymphocyte proliferation was evident in dm <dig>  dm <dig>  dm <dig> and dm <dig> wells with antigen but not in control wells incubated without antigen. wells containing dm <dig> lymphocytes failed to proliferate in the presence of antigen and were, thus, excluded from this analysis.

total rna was extracted from the cells in each well and cdna was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit that included a genomic dna elimination step . viral rna was detected in lymph node cell cultures by reverse-transcription pcr using andv s segment-specific primers and elisa titers of serum samples to andv nucleocapsid ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ; neutralizing antibodies were not examined since they were not expected to be produced until after 21 days post infection
 <cit> , a week after the deer mice in this study were euthanized. sixty-two immune genes were not modulated, whereas  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated. the upregulated genes are involved in th1/th2/treg cell differentiation, class switching and antibody synthesis , inflammation, the type i and iii ifn responses and a number of transcription factors and proteins involved in the promotion of cell cycle progression. the array contains  <dig> genes for the differentiation of helper t cell subsets and  <dig> of these were modulated. of the remaining  <dig> genes involved in other aspects of the host response, including innate and adaptive responses,  <dig> were modulated.

th <dig> subset markers
variation in samples from lymph node cells incubated without antigen was small for nearly all genes, similar to our observations with uninfected deer mice
 <cit> . for antigen recall experiments,  <dig> of  <dig> th <dig> genes  were significantly expressed , whereas one gene  was repressed . several genes were substantially upregulated in t cells from some deer mice, but not others . for example, deer mice dm <dig> and dm <dig> expressed  <dig> th <dig> markers , whereas dm <dig> expressed only  <dig> and dm <dig> expressed  <dig>  for ifng, a th <dig> cytokine, dm <dig> and dm <dig> had more than  <dig> -fold increased expression, whereas dm <dig> and dm <dig> expressed basal levels or less. tbx <dig>  which encodes the t-bet transcription factor, was not upregulated in any of the lymph node cell cultures. t-bet is considered the “master regulator” of th <dig> differentiation. of the two inflammatory cytokines, lta was downregulated and tnf was at basal level. heirachical clustering grouped dm <dig> with dm <dig>  and dm <dig> with dm4/dm <dig> to the exclusion of dm <dig>  which expressed the fewest th <dig> genes. irf <dig>  runx <dig> and stat <dig> expression were grouped as high- expression genes, whereas traf <dig>  tnf and ifng were grouped largely by expression in dm <dig> and dm <dig> lymph node cell cultures.

th <dig> subset markers
of the  <dig> genes that distinguish th <dig> cells,  <dig> were significantly upregulated  and  <dig> were downregulated . seven of the  <dig> genes on the array that are part of the il- <dig> signaling pathway were upregulated, including genes that are also expressed by activated b cells. gata <dig>  which is the master regulator of th <dig> development was unchanged. as with th <dig> genes, several th <dig> genes were upregulated in some of the deer mice but not others . dm <dig> expressed  <dig> th <dig> genes, whereas dm <dig> and dm <dig> expressed  <dig> and  <dig> th <dig> genes, respectively; dm <dig> only expressed  <dig> th <dig> genes. as with th <dig> markers, dm <dig> and dm <dig> clustered together; however, dm <dig> clustered closer to the exclusion of dm <dig>  gene expression clusters fell into three broad groups of th <dig> genes .

treg subset markers
two markers of treg cell subsets were upregulated  whereas one was slightly repressed  . tgfb was highly expressed in dm <dig>  and dm <dig>  and moderately expressed in dm <dig> ; its expression was near basal levels in dm <dig>  pou2f <dig>  which can be expressed by inducible tregs, was elevated in all four deer mouse lymph node cell cultures. however, it is also a critical transcription factor in b cells for immunoglobulin synthesis. foxp <dig>  the master regulator of treg cell development, was not modulated in any of the lymph node cell cultures . unlike th <dig> and th <dig> markers, dm <dig> and dm <dig> clustered together, then with dm <dig> and to the exclusion of dm <dig>  a single gene group clustered with only pou2f <dig> and tfgb expression.

th <dig> subset markers
the il1r <dig> gene, a marker of th <dig> cells, was slightly repressed, but none of the five th <dig> genes were upregulated , suggesting this phenotype is not active during the host response to andv. however, il17re, a receptor for il-17c, expression was moderately elevated in dm <dig> and dm <dig> . dm <dig> and dm <dig> clustered, and dm <dig> and dm <dig> clustered. no clear gene clustering occurred in this group and only two genes were elevated, one in dm <dig>  and two in dm <dig> .

other immune gene markers
of the  <dig> immune genes not specific for helper t cell subsets,  <dig> were significantly upregulated  and  <dig> were downregulated  . the il2ra gene, which encodes the il-2rα chain found on activated t cells and is constitutively expressed by treg cells, was elevated, as were trp53inp <dig> , runx <dig> , ccl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> . uts <dig> , zeb <dig> , ifna <dig> , maf , tnfrsf <dig> , oas <dig>  and ccl <dig>  were all slightly but significantly downregulated. the remaining genes are involved in various aspects of the immune response, including innate immunity and transition from innate to adaptive immunity; these genes were not modulated in the lymph node cell cultures upon antigen recall. dm <dig>  dm <dig> and dm <dig> clustered to the exclusion of dm <dig> with a single cluster group of four expressed genes  .

discussion
the deer mouse is among a growing list of non-model rodent species to have its genome deep sequenced . unfortunately, its genome is not annotated and, thus, presents challenges for exploiting it as a research tool. moreover, considering that more than  <dig> other species of peromyscus are found in north america and mexico, its genome is an important resource for other investigators that work with this genus. thus, we developed a method for rapidly identifying real-time pcr primer candidates for cdnas of interest for the deer mouse that can be used for quantitative expression analysis. we used this tool to produce a 94-gene immunoarray to examine expression of a variety of t cell differentiation and antiviral genes in lymph node cell recall assays from deer mice infected with andv. while transcription data have several limitations, such as an inability to assess translational or post-translational events , they can provide important information about how cells respond to antigenic stimuli and what pathways may be candidates for further scrutiny with protein-specific assays. this array showed that several immunological pathways were activated during in vitro lymph node cell recall responses to andv antigen, with a preponderance of th2-like gene expression.

the majority of expressed subset markers were suggestive of th <dig> cells . th <dig> cells historically have been considered important for antibody responses to extracellular pathogens and toxins and less important for viral infections. however, most studies examining t cell responses have focused on pathogenic viruses and since andv is not pathogenic in deer mice it may be that such a response is protective from persistent infection. th <dig> and treg genes were also upregulated, but no indication of a th <dig> response, suggesting a mixed th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cell response. we found similar results with primary t cell lines from deer mice at 10 days post infection with snv, in which ifng, il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig> and tgfb were elevated
 <cit> . however, with andv infection, neither il <dig> or il <dig> expression appear elevated. it is noteworthy that the t cell lines from snv infected deer mice in this previous work were of spleen origin, collected at  <dig> dpi and propagated on bone-marrow derived apc that were likely dendritic cells. in the present work, lymphocytes from lymph nodes were used, thus it is possible that cell source, timing and culturing methods could alter the expression of genes. however, since the present work used freshly isolated lymph node cells it is likely to be more relevant to natural infection compared to t cell lines, which require months to generate, may select for rare clones and which may be influenced by developmental cues from the apcs. examination of il- <dig>  which is closely linked to il- <dig> in other mammalian species and likely so in deer mice, and il- <dig> may be important in the different outcomes of deer mice infected with andv  or snv .

seven of the  <dig> genes of the il- <dig> signaling pathway on the array were upregulated; il <dig>  il4ra, jak <dig>  stat <dig>  nfatc2ip, il <dig> and irf <dig>  socs <dig>  gata <dig> and il4rc, also part of the pathway, were not modulated. activation of th <dig> cells results in the dimerization of nfatc2ip with irf <dig>  which were in the same expression cluster group , within those cells and which is a transactivator of the il- <dig> promoter
 <cit> . il- <dig> is then secreted from th <dig> cells and binds to its receptors on target cells, including b cells, where it activates the jak <dig> pathway and induces dimerization of irf4/stat <dig>  that leads to b cell activation, germinal center formation, class switching, maturation to plasma cells, affinity maturation and antibody secretion
 <cit> . il-4-stimulated b cells that also have cd <dig>  engaged  increase expression of pou2f <dig> which, in laboratory house mice, leads to increased synthesis and secretion of igg
 <cit> . pou2f <dig> is also a marker of treg cells, thus we cannot discriminate its expression in lymph node cultures, which have t cells and b cells. considering the number of genes in this pathway that are expressed during andv infection, additional genes of the pathway should be examined. the il- <dig> intercellular communication pathway has more than  <dig> proteins involved in cognate interactions of t cells and b cells, thus expression analysis and examination of phosphorylation events should be a high priority for future work.

interferon-γ  induces the expression of several transcription factors, including members of the interferon response factor  family
 <cit> . ifnγ ligation induces the activation of stat <dig>  expression of which was elevated in all of the deer mouse lymph node cell cultures , that, in turn, activates a number of other factors, including irf <dig>  irf <dig> directs the differentiation of antigen-stimulated primary t cells towards the th <dig> phenotype. irf <dig> controls a variety of maturation events in both t and b cells, including the maturation of t cells toward the th <dig>  th <dig> or th <dig> phenotypes
 <cit> , and induction of class switching, which precedes somatic hypermutation leading to affinity maturation
 <cit> , and plasma cell formation in b cells, which also requires il- <dig> and il-6
 <cit> . il- <dig>  which contributes to germinal center plasma cell formation in the laboratory house mouse, was not upregulated. it is also involved in expression of mhc class ii molecules in dendritic cells that are critical for initiating helper t cell responses to antigens. irf <dig> expression in follicular helper t  cells is essential for germinal center formation
 <cit> . irf <dig> is expressed by germinal center b cells, but not plasma cells, where it participates in the regulation of more than  <dig> genes involved in b cell activation and maturation, and interaction with tfh cells and follicular dendritic cells that present antigen in its native confirmation to germinal center b cells
 <cit> . runx <dig> is expressed by b cells and promotes proliferation, presumably during clonal expansion induced by th <dig> cells
 <cit> .

both deer mice that had increased levels of ifng mrna  also had high levels of tnf mrna; however, infection with andv does not cause conspicuous inflammation in deer mice
 <cit> . considering that ifnγ induces activation of stat <dig>  which was significantly elevated in all four deer mice, it is unclear how its absence results in increased stat <dig> gene expression; however, by 3 days post culture it is possible that ifng expression had already subsided in the two cultures that were ifng-negative. in addition to its role in t cell activation, stat <dig> is also the major signaler/transcription factor for type i and type iii ifns and is typically a marker for innate signaling. in the ln cultures there is probably little or no active virus replication , but the innate response might be triggered by addition of antigen. it is also noteworthy that the important regulators of th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cells  for the laboratory house mouse are not upregulated in deer mice infected with andv, yet many genes associated with the expression of these regulators are expressed, nonetheless. it may be that expression of those genes is unnecessary , or that by 14 days post infection they are no longer needed and are subsequently repressed. most transcription factors are tightly regulated because they have enzyme-like activity; small amounts can profoundly affect downstream signaling cascades and gene expression. regardless, it is clear that genes associated with three helper t cell subsets are expressed during the immune response to andv. it will be necessary to examine the activities of these transcription factors to clarify their roles; fortunately, many of these proteins are highly conserved and antibodies to their orthologs in other species  are likely cross-reactive with many deer mouse proteins. the small sample size presented here  limits interpretation of these data; however, the number of genes examined should allow extensive examination of the host response to clarify the pathways involved in deer mouse responses to infectious agents.

the development of software that allows rapid deployment of real-time pcr expression arrays for the deer mouse should help clarify the immunological events that govern hantavirus persistence or clearance from rodent reservoirs. the data presented here demonstrates that such work can be done, and that it generates substantial amounts of data indicating which pathways may, or may not, be involved in the host response. this should permit more efficient examination of these pathways using commercially available, cross-reactive antibodies to specific signaling molecules that may play decisive roles in hantavirus clearance.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a rapid method for designing real-time pcr arrays for the deer mouse that can be used to study the host immune response to viral infections. lymph node t cells from deer mice infected with andv express mostly genes of the th <dig> phenotype but fewer genes of th <dig> and treg phenotypes. seven genes of the il- <dig> signaling pathway were elevated in the array, suggesting this cytokine may play a role in clearance of andv from deer mice.
