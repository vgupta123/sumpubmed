BACKGROUND
according to global health council despite advances in the understanding of cancer biology, malignant neoplasms remain the second leading cause of mortality in united states. novel therapies are needed and over the past two decades new immunotherapy strategies have emerged as a promising approach. the success of these immunotherapeutic strategies is highly dependent on finding an ideal antigen to target. one such target is the egf receptor which is over or aberrantly expressed in a variety of human cancers  <cit> . however, the fact that the egf receptor is present on normal tissue could lead to possible deleterious side effects or immune tolerance when treating patients with reagents solely targeting the egf receptor. a tumor specific antigen would be more ideal. epidermal growth factor receptor variant iii  is the most common variant of the egf receptor and is expressed in a number of solid tumors including glioblastoma multiforme , breast adenocarcinoma, medulloblastoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma, but has only rarely been observed in normal tissue  <cit> . this variant receptor results from an in-frame deletion of exons 2- <dig> of the wild type egf receptor. this causes a deletion of a large portion of the extracellular domain and the generation of a novel glycine at the fusion junction between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  <cit> . egfrviii is ligand independent yet constitutively active and when expressed in cells it leads to unregulated growth, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis  <cit> . egfrviii is an ideal target for immunotherapy because the juxtaposition of exon  <dig> and  <dig> sequences plus the novel glycine creates a highly immunogenic tumor specific antigen, and the receptor itself leads to a cancer phenotype due to its constitutive activity  <cit> .

there are a number of immune approaches that specifically target egfrviii. for example, a peptide vaccine targeting this mutant receptor is currently being tested in clinical trials for gbm patients  <cit> . another approach is the development of antibodies that recognize egfrviii which can be used for diagnostic/laboratory purposes or for therapeutic purposes either alone or attached to a cytotoxic or radiolabeled adjunct  <cit> . many of the monoclonal antibodies that target egfrviii, however, have cross reactivity with the wild type egf receptor or other non-specific proteins  <cit>  or comparatively have low affinity. while polyclonal antibodies are apparently highly sensitive and of high affinity, it is difficult to produce them in mass quantities. an additional complicating factor is that the rights to the antibody for egfrviii are patented and have not been made widely available for either scientific or medical use.

to generate a highly specific and cost effective antibody that could be used for scientific and clinical purposes, we developed a recombinant antibody. recombinant antibody technology has gained popularity in recent years because of its many advantages when compared with the production of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. first, no animals are needed and the manufacturing time is relatively short compared with conventional methods. moreover, the quality and quantity of the final product is superior when compared to conventional antibody production. recombinant antibodies are formed by combining single-chain fv antibodies, consisting of vh and vl chains, by a flexible linker  <cit> . in this report, we describe how we created a recombinant antibody that specifically recognizes egfrviii and demonstrate its specificity by western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry , immunofluorescence , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  and flow cytometry analysis . this easily produced and highly specific recombinant antibody holds great potential to be used as a diagnostic and a therapeutic tool.

RESULTS
western analysis
we constructed the first recombinant egfrviii antibody, rabviii, using the sequence of mr1- <dig>  an scfv developed against egfrviii   <cit> . to determine the specificity of rabviii antibody for egfrviii, we used it for western blot analysis. consistent with previously published data, the rabviii antibody recognizes the  <dig> kda egfrviii protein band in u87-viii cells stably expressing egfrviii  compared to the u87-mg untransfected cells   <cit> . the rabviii antibody also faintly recognized the endogenous  <dig> kda wild type egf receptor and it strongly recognize a  <dig> kda protein band in both u87-viii and u87-mg control cells. we speculated that the  <dig> kda protein was cross-reaction with another egf receptor variant that we have recently identified, called mleek. minileek  is the result of the fusion of exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> and is predicted to be  <dig> kda in size . this also creates a glycine at the junction and the fusion junction  bears some resemblance to the egfrviii sequence.

the crystal structure of mr1- <dig> in complex with the egfrviii peptide has been done by landry et al. <cit>  this shows the valine at p <dig> position of the egfrviii peptide forms a hydrogen bond with tyrosine at h <dig> and h <dig> on mr1- <dig>  the mleek peptide has a valine at the identical position. since rabviii potentially cross reacted with mleek, to eliminate the non-specific  <dig> kda band we mutated the tyrosines at h <dig> and h <dig> to phenylalanine.

to determine if the mutated rabdmviii has improved specificity towards egfrviii, we conducted another western analysis. we found that rabdmviii now specifically recognizes only the egfrviii  <dig> kda protein band and not the egfr variant  <dig> kda band . we also more rigorously tested cross-reaction with wt egf receptor by performing western blots using lysates from a <dig> cells, which express  <dig> ×  <dig> receptors per cell. when we studied the specificity of rabdmviii towards the overexpressed wild type egfr present in a <dig> cells we discovered that the rabdmviii antibody did cross-react with the  <dig> kda wild type protein .

consequently, to further study the specificity of the rabdmviii under these conditions we expanded our analysis to include hc <dig> cells which expresses egfrviii at a level comparable to that of egfr expressed by a <dig> . western analysis using anti-egfr antibody e <dig> from sigma shows that there are similar amounts of wild type egfr and egfrviii protein expressed in a <dig> and hc <dig> cells .

based on the study done by johns et al. which showed that monoclonal antibody  <dig> recognizes overexpressed egfr in a <dig> cells only under reducing conditions, we further analyzed both hc <dig> and a <dig> cell lysates under non-reducing western conditions  <cit> . western analysis under these conditions shows that recombinant rabdmviii recognizes only the egfrviii  <dig> kda band and not the wild type egfr  <dig> kda band  suggesting that under reducing conditions the egfr epitope is somewhat more exposed and accessible to rabdmviii  <cit> . on the other hand, the non mutated rabviii consistently recognizes the  <dig> kda wild type egfr band even under non-reducing western conditions clearly illustrating that rabdmviii is a more specific egfrviii antibody than rabviii.

antibody affinity
to determine the affinity constant of the antibody, we used the method described by friguet et al.   <cit> . it is necessary that the concentration of the antibody used in the elisa should be equal to or less than the value of dissociation constant of the antibody. thus a preliminary elisa was performed to deduce the dissociation constant of the antibody. from the preliminary elisa, the dissociation constant of rabviii and rabdmviii is calculated to be approximately  <dig>  μm and  <dig> nm, respectively, against egfrviii peptide . this result suggests that rabdmviii did not lose its affinity after mutation as rabdmviii has a lower dissociation constant than rabviii.

the indirect elisa was performed with rabdmviii using a concentration of  <dig> nm, which is lower than its dissociation constant value of  <dig> nm. the od values from this elisa were placed in a scatchard plot equation where the fraction of bound antibody sites α  is plotted on the x axis and the ratio of the fraction of bound antibody sites α to free antigen sites c,  is plotted on the y axis. the slope gives the value of -k, the affinity constant of the antibody, which is  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> .

immunoprecipitation
immunoprecipitation of hc <dig> and a <dig> cell lysates was performed using rabdmviii and g <dig> an anti-egfrviii monoclonal antibody . as a negative recombinant antibody control for egfr wt and egfrviii, we also used rabcd <dig>  which utilizes the same expression vector as rabdmviii but is directed against cd <dig> and recognizes neither egfr wt nor egfrviii. hc <dig> cell lysates immunoprecipitated with rabdmviii and g <dig> antibody and then further immunoblotted with e <dig> antibody showed the expected  <dig> kda band corresponding to egfrviii in the pellet whereas rabcd <dig> did not show the  <dig> kda band in the pellet as it does not bind to egfrviii  on the contrary, when a <dig> cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either rabdmviii, g <dig> or rabcd <dig> and then immunoblotted with the e <dig> antibody, the <dig> kda bands corresponding to wt egfr was found in the supernatant . this suggested that even when abundant amounts of wt egfr protein is present rabdmviii did not bind to any wild type egfr.

immunofluorescence
since the specificity of rabdmviii is greatly enhanced under native conditions, we decided to test the recombinant antibody specificity under in vivo conditions. to this end, indirect immunofluorescence was performed on hc <dig> and a <dig> cells with rabdmviii at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/μl. images were taken using a leica sp <dig> aobs confocal microscope. consistent with previous findings, the rabdmviii shows that the egfrviii protein is both membrane bound and has an intracellular localization   <cit> . to verify the specificity of the rabdmviii antibody we conducted a peptide competition using the egfrviii epitope . the presence of the egfrviii epitope completely blocked rabdmviii from interacting with the egfrviii found in the hc <dig> cells , as compared to the scramble epitope control which showed no decrease in detection of egfrviii . additionally, the a <dig> cells that over express wild type egfr did not demonstrate any signal with rabdmviii , whereas the anti-egfr antibody recognizes a strong egfr wild type signal demonstrating that the a431cells retain high expression of the wild type protein . together these findings indicate again that this recombinant antibody is highly specific towards egfrviii.

immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemistry  is another sensitive biochemical test to monitor for the expression of egfrviii. to determine if the rabdmviii antibody could be used for ihc, we used mouse tumor xenografts from hc <dig> and a <dig> cells  and gbm cases . the tumor xenografts contain both hc <dig> tissue  and a <dig> tissue . rabdmviii shows strong positivity to the hc <dig> section which is comparable in intensity to slides stained with the positive control anti-egfrviii polyclonal antibody . in addition, the rabdmviii antibody did not stain the a <dig> tissue sections . the recombinant antibody rabcd <dig> was used as a negative antibody control . we extended our findings to two gbm cases, one positive for egfrviii  and one negative . consistent with the mouse tumor xenografts, the rabdmviii antibody only stained the gbm positive for egfrviii and had no cross reactivity to the negative gbm case . as a control, we also stained these sections with affinity purified polyclonal anti-egfrviii and observed similar results .

flow cytometry
because rabdmviii efficiently detects surface egfrviii, we asked if it might be an effective reagent for flow cytometry experiments. under native conditions we observed that rabdmviii binds to surface expressed egfrviii very efficiently. figure 7a shows an overlay of plots from hc <dig> cells stained with increasing concentration of rabdmviii . the dot blot and histogram in blue represents human-igg <dig> isotype control and as low as  <dig>  ug of rabdmviii shows a significant shift in fluorescence intensity. higher concentration of rabdmviii  show the presence of multiple peaks consistent with the immunofluorescence assay  which shows different levels of egfrviii expression. to look at the sensitivity of rabdmviii in identifying and isolating egfrviii expressing cells, we mixed nih3t <dig> and hc <dig> cells at a 1: <dig> stoichiometry prior to staining with rabdmviii. rabdmviii was able to clearly identify and separate the hc <dig> cells from nih3t <dig> cells.

one of the earlier concerns in developing the recombinant egfrviii antibodies was the potential cross-reactivity towards wt egfr under conditions where the receptor is over-expressed such as that in a <dig> cells. flow cytometry allows quantitation of any potential cross-reaction under native conditions. figure 7c is the overlap of plots of a <dig>  and hc <dig>  cells with rabdmviii. there is very little reactivity of rabdmviii with a <dig> as compared to hc <dig> cells demonstrating that this reagent does not cross-react with wt egfr. we further tested rabdmviii for surface staining of freshly primary tumor cells and observed about 14% of cells to be egfrviii positive over the isotype control.

discussion
in this work, we have constructed a novel recombinant antibody, rabdmviii, which specifically recognizes egfrviii. based upon a previously described scfv against egfrviii, we have performed further mutagenesis to eliminate cross reaction with a  <dig> kda band. we have demonstrated the specificity of this antibody for egfrviii and not wt egfr or any other protein by several methods. unlike other monoclonal anti-egfrviii antibodies, this antibody is broadly useful because it recognizes the egfrviii epitope in several assays including elisa, if, ihc, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry.

a distinct advantage is that recombinantly produced antibodies require no animal for production but otherwise have the properties of conventional antibodies but with additional, improved properties. indeed, the rabdmviii has been engineered to have an igg fc region, which confers long serum half life, and has selected to support secondary immune functions, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  and complement mediated cytotoxicity   <cit> . studies have demonstrated that fc-containing bsab and other fusion proteins do retain the full effector mechanisms of the fc component  <cit> .

effective tumor targeting requires that the antibody should have an affinity for its tumor antigen but extremely high affinity may in fact be detrimental  <cit> . previous studies have shown that very high affinity interactions of  <dig> m- <dig> between antibodies and tumor antigens may actually impair efficient tumor penetration of the monoclonal antibodies and thus diminish effective in vivo targeting  <cit> . fujimori et al.  <cit>  and van osdol et al.  <cit>  have also demonstrated that higher affinity monoclonal antibodies do not homogenously distribute and show less killing of the target cancer cells. according to robinson et al., a high antibody affinity restricts the localization and tumor penetration of fv antibody molecules  <cit> . in another study, langmuir et al.  <cit>  have shown that a lower affinity mab of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  <dig> m- <dig> was nearly as toxic as a mab with an affinity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig>  our antibody has an affinity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> as shown by saturation elisa so it could be a reasonable candidate for therapeutic studies.

in separate studies, we have already begun to explore the effectiveness of the rabdmviii in targeting tumor spheres derived from glioblastoma tumors. these experiments have already shown that this reagent specifically lyse the cells expressing egfrviii and spare normal neural stem cells . we performed cytotoxicity assays using a coupled luminescence method on various egfrviii transfected cell lines with human nk cells as effectors and found that this reagent significantly induces cell killing of egfrviii transfected cells. rab dmviii also remarkably reduces the sphere initiating frequency on gbm cells but not in normal cells as it has been shown that egfrviii is required for the maintenance of glioma growth in vivo  <cit> . to further investigate this reagent in mouse models, two gbm sphere lines were incubated with either rabdmviii, rabcd <dig> or a non-specific human control antibody and orthotopically injected into the cortex of nod-scid mice. tumor formation was analyzed after  <dig> weeks which revealed a higher incidence of human tumor cells engraftment with rabcd <dig> and hu-igg <dig> as compared to rabdmviii . in order to provide this reagent to other researchers and for future studies, we are planning to scale up antibody production using hollow fiber bioreactor system. hence this antibody could be of great significance in the field of brain tumor research.

CONCLUSIONS
despite significant advances in the field of neuro-oncology and immunology, there is no widely available egfrviii antibody for scientific or clinical use. furthermore, there is no egfrviii antibody clinically proven to be used on patients because of cross reactions and other high risk allergic reactions due to murine fc portion of the monoclonal antibodies. rabdmviii has shown high specificity towards egfrviii and thus holds great potential to be further investigated for therapeutic purposes.
