BACKGROUND
domestication of plants is a complex evolutionary process in which human selection favours phenotypic transitions making them more useful for humans and better adapted to landscape management. it is a crucial step in the evolution of crop species since humans have an important impact on their origins and changes. moreover, selection pressure and local diversification lead to an ongoing process  <cit> . two major impacts on plant diversity result from domestication. firstly, changes in traits selected for human use, called the “domestication syndrome”  <cit> , lead to selection signatures at specific loci  <cit> . in fact, according to the intensity of the selection process, the degree of change in populations can vary along a continuum from their wild ancestors to the domesticated populations, which cannot reproduce or survive without human intervention. several highly domesticated plants such as maize, rice and wheat express domestication traits and have lost their ability to survive on their own in the wild  <cit> . other crops like trees and forage are generally considered to be partially domesticated while conserving some ability to survive in natural environments  <cit> . in seed-propagated crops, domesticated types are characterized by a lack of seed dispersal at maturity and a lack of seed dormancy  <cit> , while in clonally propagated crops, the reduction of sexual fertility and adaptations facilitating vegetative propagation have generally been reported  <cit> .

the second major consequence of domestication is the reduction of genetic diversity in crops relative to their wild progenitors due to human selection and genetic drift through bottleneck effects  <cit> . contrary to selection which only affects genetic diversity at target genes  <cit> , bottleneck processes reduce neutral genetic diversity across the entire genome  <cit> . the strength of genetic drift during the domestication bottleneck is determined by its duration and the effective population size  <cit> . thus, according to their life-history traits and evolutionary history, diversity loss differs considerably among crop plants. the reduction of gene diversity in crops compared to wild relatives has been observed in soybean , maize  and wheat   <cit> . however, introgressive hybridization between domesticated forms and their wild relatives has often expanded genetic diversity, counteracting the effects of the initial domestication bottleneck  <cit> .

for perennial fruit species, domestication means changing the reproductive biology from sexual reproduction  to vegetative propagation   <cit> . few studies have reported the impact of the domestication history and how bottleneck effects may reduce the genetic diversity of crops relative to the wild relatives. miller and schall  <cit>  provided phylogeographic evidence of multiple domestication of a cultivated fruit tree, spondias purpurea, within the mesoamerican centre of domestication. about 29% of the total diversity was not recovered in wild populations, suggesting that either new alleles have arisen during cultivation or, alternatively, contemporary extinction of tropical dry forests has occurred in mesoamerican areas leading to genetic erosion of the wild gene pool. in mediterranean zones, only a weak bottleneck effect on diversity in olive and grapevine was observed when comparing the wild and cultivated forms  <cit> . for prunus species, mariette et al.  <cit>  reported that in the case of sweet cherry a marked genetic bottleneck due to plant breeding was detected at microsatellite loci  and at the s-locus coding for a gametophytic self-incompatibility  system . however, the domestication bottleneck, as estimated by the loss of genetic diversity between wild cherry and landraces, was not detected by ssr markers but only observed at the s-locus .

apricot, prunus armeniaca l., is a stone-fruit species that is grown commercially worldwide in all temperate regions. the numerous cultivars are highly adapted to restricted areas  <cit> . apricot is clonally propagated through grafting but it is also seed-propagated, mainly in oasis agroecosystems. the mediterranean area accounts for over 50% of the worldwide production  <cit> . apricot was probably initially domesticated in china where wild apricot is found  <cit> . following several collection expeditions through the major agricultural areas of the world and based on morphological data, vavilov  <cit>  proposed an explanation to determine the centre of origin of cultivated plants and described three regions as centres of origin for apricot: a chinese centre, a central asian centre and a near east centre. the latter centre included apricot from the irano-caucasian area  and was considered as a secondary centre of cultivar diversification because of its presumed intermediate geographic position between the main area of cultivation of the domesticate and the distribution of the wild species  <cit> . on the basis of morphological characters and pomological descriptions, four major eco-geographical apricot groups were defined  <cit> :  the central asian group is the oldest and most diversified. the cultivars are self-incompatible apricots and have high-frost requirements;  the dzhungar-zailij group includes self-incompatible small-fruited cultivars;  the irano-caucasian group mostly encompasses self-incompatible apricots with reduced chilling requirements; and  the european group is the most recent one, including self-compatible cultivars. according to the morphological characters, the expansion of apricot species into the mediterranean basin may have occurred in two waves along two distinct major apricot diffusion routes  <cit> : the first one being brought by the arabs through the near east and north africa, and the second through hungary and central europe. however, kostina  <cit>  reported only one major route from the irano-caucasian area to the mediterranean basin. hence, apricot domestication and its diffusion into the mediterranean basin are still debated issues.

recently, improvements in neutral molecular markers have significantly increased the capacity of genetic characterization and relationship studies in different apricot cultivars, generating important information relating to the genetic variability, selection processes and breeding history of this crop at a large spatial scale. in this setting, using both microsatellite and aflp markers, apricot accessions collected from different eco-geographical groups  have been grouped according to their geographical origin and pedigree information supporting the history of apricot diffusion from its centre of origin  <cit> . however, these studies considered material collections, including both traditional cultivars and selected accessions derived from breeding programs, and did not take the difference between vegetative and seed propagation into account.

in europe, clonal propagation through grafting and cuttings was used for a long time. nevertheless, much of the remaining variability was from a mix between seed and grafting propagated apricots   <cit> . in north africa , apricot germplasm contained accessions propagated by grafting, but also by seeds specifically located in oasian regions. a fine-scale genetic diversity study conducted using aflp markers at the within-population level, focusing on tunisian grafted apricot cultivars, supported the assumption of few introduced genotypes that have been firstly propagated by seeds  <cit> . analysing a larger set of tunisian apricots, including both vegetatively propagated cultivars and seed propagated accessions, bourguiba et al.  <cit>  identified two main gene pools according to their propagation mode and confirmed the assumption that these two gene pools shared the same origin.

a gradient of decreasing genetic diversity from east to west was proposed by hagen et al.  <cit>  among the four identified apricot groups: ‘diversification’, ‘adaptive diversity’, ‘continental europe’ and ‘mediterranean basin’, which could be related to the apricot diffusion process. however, this study was limited to a small sample  and based on a phenetic approach related to the geographic origin and the phenotypic characters of the cultivars.

we still have incomplete knowledge of apricot domestication and diffusion into the mediterranean basin based on the assumption of a genetic diversity decrease  <cit>  and balancing between one  <cit>  or two major diffusion routes  <cit> . this was the first study generating insight into these evolutionary and historical processes following a genetic structure analysis in apricot which included a large sample size of local mediterranean material and involved microsatellite markers as well as a model-based bayesian clustering approach. owing to their transferability across prunus species, simple sequence repeat  markers have been widely used in variability studies and linkage map construction  <cit> . a set of  <dig> microsatellite markers was selected according to their polymorphism in apricot cultivars and their mapping over the prunus genome.

the goal of this study was to clarify the history of the apricot domestication process in the mediterranean area through an analysis of genotypes originating from algeria, france, iran, italy, morocco, spain, tunisia and turkey. we specifically addressed the following questions:  what is the genetic structure of mediterranean apricots compared to irano-caucasian germplasm?  is there a loss of genetic diversity from the near-eastern secondary centre of diversification to the extreme south-western mediterranean area? and  can distinct apricot diffusion routes be identified throughout the mediterranean basin?

RESULTS
ssr polymorphism
a total of  <dig> alleles was detected across the  <dig> ssr loci used, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> per locus . the average number of alleles per locus was  <dig>  but dropped to  <dig>  when rare alleles were removed . the number of alleles per locus with a frequency higher than 5% ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average pic value for the  <dig> loci was  <dig>  and the most informative locus was udp98- <dig> . only three among the  <dig> ssr loci displayed a significant heterozygosity deficit  in apricot from the irano-caucasian area , which is considered as a secondary diversification zone  <cit> , indicating the lack of null alleles even though most of ssr loci were not specifically developed in apricot  <cit> .

the nei’s genetic diversity ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig>  , suggesting that the examined mediterranean apricot germplasm enclosed higher polymorphism than reported in previous studies  <cit> . compared to peach, apricot had higher polymorphism and was more diversified as confirmed by the number of alleles per locus and the observed heterozygosity, which was significantly higher on the  <dig> ssr loci that were used in both studies  <cit>  .

genetic structure and diversity within apricot geographic groups
according to the geographic origin of the studied apricot accessions, we defined eleven groups . they displayed substantial genetic differentiation since the average fst value was  <dig> , ranging from  <dig>  for pairwise comparisons between the iran and turkey groups to  <dig>  between the murcia and oases of tunisia groups . all pairwise fst values were significant at p < 10– <dig>  except for the one observed between south italy and murcia, which was significant at p < 10– <dig> 

genetic relationships among the defined apricot groups were assessed based on nei’s  <cit>  genetic distances and the neighbor-joining algorithm . according to the bootstrap values, the  <dig> apricot groups were classified into three regions . region a, including iran and turkey groups , was clearly distinguished from the remaining groups by a high bootstrap support of  <dig> % . region b, including continental europe, south france and south italy groups, was defined by a bootstrap value of  <dig> %. the third region  included the five apricot groups from north africa area as well as murcia group, supported by a weak bootstrap value . based on the amova analysis, the genetic variance was about 7% among these three defined regions and 14% among apricot groups per region .

the group level considered the eleven apricot geographic groups and the region level encompassed the three main geographic regions: a , b , and c .

the mean number of accessions per group was  <dig> , ranging from  <dig> for the murcia group to  <dig> for the turkey group . the levels of the genetic diversity estimators measured within these geographic groups differed: iran and turkey groups , had the highest expected heterozygosity values, with  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively; while the oases of tunisia and draa valley groups  had the lowest ones, with  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the observed heterozygosity was highest for south italy  and lowest for draa valley . for the following groups: turkey, murcia, moulouya valley and draa valley, the fis values showed a significant heterozygosity deficit .

as the number of alleles observed in a group is highly dependent on the sample size, the allelic richness and private allelic richness were computed for each group and region . the highest allelic richness was detected for the iran and turkey groups , with  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while the lowest value was noted in the draa valley , messaad  and oases of tunisia  groups belonging to region c. similar results were obtained when computing the private allelic richness. thus, region a had a significant upper level of genetic diversity in terms of allelic richness, private allelic richness and expected heterozygosity , reflecting a decrease in genetic diversity from the eastern  to the south-western  mediterranean basin.

model-based bayesian clustering analysis
using the model-based bayesian clustering approach implemented in structure  <cit> , the genetic structure of mediterranean apricot was examined according to the model with  <dig> clusters  to  <dig> clusters . the ad hoc quantity based on the second order rate of change of the likelihood function   <cit>  revealed a first level of clustering at k =  <dig> for the investigated mediterranean apricots  and a sub-clustering at k =  <dig> . based on the permuted average q-matrix generated by clumpp for the  <dig> structure runs, the highest similarity coefficient  was observed for k =  <dig>  and k =  <dig> , indicating the stability of the results for these two models .

at k =  <dig>  apricot accessions from iran and turkey and a few accessions from italy and france were separated from the other ones . at k =  <dig>  accessions from continental europe, south italy, south france and murcia were separated from those located in the maghreb. at k =  <dig>  a fourth cluster, including some accessions from continental europe, south italy and south france, was identified as originating from the ‘adaptive diversity’ group previously defined by hagen et al.  <cit> . at k =  <dig> and k =  <dig>  the genetic structure of mediterranean apricot within three main gene pools was not modified since the accessions of the fifth and sixth clusters were not consistently assigned and hence no distinctive additional cluster was noted .

the k =  <dig> model was chosen to obtain an in-depth overview of apricot genetic structure in the mediterranean area. four genetic clusters were thus defined and most of the apricot accessions  were assigned to a cluster with a probability superior to 80%: cluster  <dig>  containing  <dig> accessions originating from the ‘irano-caucasian’ area, cluster  <dig>  including  <dig> accessions referred to the ‘adaptive diversity’ group  <cit> , cluster  <dig>  composed of  <dig> accessions from the ‘north mediterranean basin’ area and a few from the south mediterranean and cluster  <dig>  with  <dig> accessions originating from the ‘south mediterranean basin’ region . the remaining  <dig> accessions  of the sample were assumed to have an admixed ancestry . the admixture was clearly observed in apricots from the north tunisia  and moulouya valley  groups . the four genetic clusters were significantly differentiated, as reflected by the high global fst value . the genetic differentiation among the three main clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average value of  <dig>  .

a significant reduction of genetic diversity between apricot gene pools
a significant reduction of allelic richness and private allelic richness was observed when regions b and c were compared to region a . these observations confirmed the presence of a substantial gradient of decreasing genetic diversity of apricot germplasm from the east  to the southwest , depicting apricot domestication and its diffusion history towards the mediterranean area  <cit> .

for each estimator, the relative reduction of diversity was determined by calculating 1-, where div <dig> is the estimator of diversity in the supposed original gene pool and div <dig> is the estimator of diversity in the supposed original gene pool.

 <dig> computed based on all ssr loci used in this study ;  <dig> computed based only on  <dig> ssr loci under the assumption of neutrality.

to properly assess the reduction of genetic diversity due to the domestication bottleneck, a neutral subsample of loci was determined by removing those presumed to be under selection within populations. thus, we analysed clusters as defined by a model-based bayesian clustering since they were significantly differentiated without genetic structure at the intra-cluster level in order to detect true positive outlier loci, as proposed by excoffier et al.  <cit> . an analysis using fdist <dig> software was conducted on three comparisons of these three main clusters:  clusters  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  clusters  <dig> and  <dig> , and  clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . the fst calculated by fdist <dig> between clusters  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig> . based on the first analysis, only one outlier locus was detected at the 95% level: cppct <dig> locus . this outlier was removed for a second analysis. no outlier was detected and the fst value was  <dig> . a similar analysis was carried out on clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  the fst was  <dig>  and no outlier was detected at the 95% level . finally, using the same procedure, the fst between clusters  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig> . no outlier was detected at the 95% level .

when looking for the genetic diversity parameters within the three main clusters, similar results were obtained based on both all ssr loci and only on  <dig> ssr loci following the assumption of neutrality . significant differences were noted for the allelic richness and private allelic richness when comparing clusters  <dig> and  <dig> as well as clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  further, the observed and expected heterozygosity values were significantly different when comparing clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . hence, a significant reduction of allelic richness and private allelic richness was observed using both all ssr loci, and only ssr loci based on the neutrality assumption, when both clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were compared to cluster  <dig> . such a reduction of allelic richness , private allelic richness , and observed and expected heterozygosity  confirmed the decrease in genetic diversity among genetic clusters from the eastern  to the south-western  mediterranean basin .

a cluster  <dig> was not taken into account in the genetic diversity analysis because of its limited size .

specific alleles within pairs of geographic regions and genetic clusters
the number of shared alleles specifically detected between pairs from each geographic region as well as between each cluster pair at all microsatellites was computed. nineteen alleles observed at  <dig> ssr loci among the total of  <dig> alleles detected at the  <dig> loci  and  <dig> alleles observed at  <dig> ssr loci  were specifically detected within regions a vs. b and a vs. c, respectively, while only  <dig> alleles observed at  <dig> ssr loci were detected within regions b vs. c . a total of  <dig> alleles were shared by at least two of the three geographic regions. among them,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were specific to regions a vs. b and a vs. c, respectively, while only  <dig> % were specific to regions b vs. c . the frequency of these alleles ranged from  <dig> , corresponding to one allele detected once in each of the two regions, to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  . the frequency of these alleles varied according to the locus was higher in region a than b and c when taking all observed shared alleles into account .

similar results were obtained when comparing clusters  <dig> and  <dig> to cluster  <dig>  twenty-three alleles observed at  <dig> ssr loci among the total of  <dig> alleles detected at the  <dig> loci  and  <dig> alleles observed at  <dig> ssr loci  were specifically detected within clusters  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig>  respectively; while only one allele observed at locus udp98- <dig> was detected within clusters  <dig> vs.  <dig> . a total of  <dig> alleles was shared by at least two of the three genetic clusters. among them,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were specific to clusters  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig>  respectively, while only  <dig> % were specific to clusters  <dig> vs.  <dig> . these results suggest that in the mediterranean basin apricot originated from the ‘irano-caucasian’ area  and diffused via two different routes, i.e. northern  and southern  routes within the mediterranean basin.

discussion
three main gene pools in the mediterranean apricot germplasm
apricot has been mainly cultivated in the mediterranean area since its earliest introduction  <cit> , while displaying high genetic diversity, as previously reported  <cit> . in this study, analysis of the genetic structure of a large representative sample of apricots located throughout the mediterranean countries generated new insight into the history of domestication and diffusion of this species within the mediterranean basin. our apricot sample included  <dig> accessions from algeria, france, iran, italy, morocco, spain, tunisia and turkey. apart from apricots from algeria, morocco and tunisia that were sampled in situ, all the remaining accessions originated from several ex situ collections. unlike a study on sweet cherry  <cit>  where the authors compared landraces to modern varieties in order to assess the breeding bottleneck, we decided to exclude accessions derived from breeding programs and with unknown passport data in order to obtain clear knowledge about the geographic origin of the studied material and hence to retain only presumed selected local apricots from seed-propagated populations for this study. despite their ex-situ status, these accessions can be considered as “in-situ sampled” since they were originally from specific geographical areas where local apricots have been diversified through selection from seed-propagated populations, as previously mentioned  <cit> . using model-based bayesian clustering without prior information about the geographic origin of the accessions, we obtained a genetic structure pattern similar to those defined with the geographic origin of the accessions. in fact, the distinction of three main genetic clusters  by structure analysis  was in concordance with the three regions  defined according to the geographic origin of the accessions, reflecting a long process of apricot domestication and diffusion in the mediterranean area.

loss of genetic diversity supporting the apricot domestication bottleneck
for most crop species, domestication processes cause a loss of genetic diversity due to the bottleneck effect and genetic drift  <cit> . in our study, this loss could be assessed by comparison of levels of diversity between geographic groups or the genetic clusters defined by structure analysis . however, estimation of genetic diversity reduction due to bottleneck domestication could be biased by human selection  <cit>  and the genetic structure within populations  <cit> . therefore, we assessed genetic diversity within clusters defined by structure using all ssr markers as well as the  <dig> presumed neutral loci after removing the cppct <dig> outlier locus. this locus was located on linkage group  <dig> of the prunus genome and not linked to the self-incompatibility locus  <cit> .

the results obtained using the two sets of markers  were congruent for all diversity estimators. a substantial decrease in genetic diversity was observed from the eastern  to the western mediterranean basin . such a loss of genetic diversity was significant when comparing clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  and clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . nevertheless, it was not significant when cluster  <dig> was compared to cluster  <dig>  despite the different modes of apricot propagation: vegetative in north mediterranean vs. sexual reproduction in south mediterranean, especially in the oasis agroecosystems in the maghreb area  <cit> .

we thus noted a substantial loss of genetic diversity that was independent of the selection impact due to the domestication bottleneck. such a loss of genetic diversity is closely in line with the apricot diffusion routes, and contrasting with patterns in other native mediterranean fruit species such as olive and grape for which a weak loss of genetic diversity between varieties and wild relatives has been observed  <cit> . the magnitude of the bottleneck depends on the number of individuals involved and the duration of these pressures  <cit> . in sweet cherry, several successive domestication events have probably occurred and a significant bottleneck associated with modern breeding was revealed, while no reduction in diversity has been shown between landraces and wild relatives  <cit> .

two routes of apricot diffusion into the mediterranean basin
the irano-caucasian area is considered as a secondary diversification zone  <cit>  for at least two reasons. first, based on ethno-botanical data, northern iran was identified as an evolutionary centre for a large number of fruit trees, including prunus species  <cit> . second, irano-caucasian apricots occupy an intermediate position between domesticated varieties and wild species, as previously described  <cit> . similar findings were also obtained for iranian apples  <cit> . although we lacked genetic data from the presumed primary gene pool of the centre of apricot origin in china  <cit> , our findings suggest that mediterranean apricots have been selected from the ‘irano-caucasian’ gene pool. indeed, 62% of alleles common to the three regions a, b and c and revealed in the northern and southern mediterranean basin were found to be shared with the ‘irano-caucasian’ gene pool. this leads to the following question: did these two gene pools diffuse into the mediterranean basin through only one route, as proposed by kostina  <cit> , or two main routes, i.e. via the northern and southern mediterranean, as hypothesised by faust et al.  <cit>  and mehlenbacher et al.  <cit> ?

the distinction of ‘south-mediterranean’ apricots from the ‘irano-caucasian’ cluster confirmed the findings of a previous study  <cit>  based on morphological characters. moreover, according to our analyses, most accessions from the murcia group  were assigned to region c, but it seems that this group is genetically intermediate between regions b  and c . spanish and north african accessions were also pooled in another aflp-based study  <cit> . in fact, the introduction of apricots into north africa and spain was attributed to the arabs during the regime of umayyad, who conquered spain between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, region c pooled apricots propagated by grafting  and by seeds . these two apricot groups, also distinct according to their mode of propagation, were recently proved to share a common genetic basis in tunisia  <cit> . in addition, some accessions encountered in north tunisia, messaad and moulouya valley represented a clear admixture between clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that gene exchanges have occurred between northern and southern mediterranean countries. these events could be related to both ancient human movements  and/or to recent material transfers associated with the french colonisation period in the early 20th century  <cit> .

by comparing cluster pairs  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig>  we observed a significant loss of genetic diversity. conversely, we noted no significant loss of genetic diversity between clusters  <dig> vs.  <dig>  while they were more differentiated than cluster pairs  <dig> vs.  <dig> and  <dig> vs.  <dig> . otherwise, a substantial proportion of specific alleles was observed along the northern mediterranean apricot diffusion route  and the southern route . these results strongly indicate that apricot was diffused through two main routes: the first one through countries north of the mediterranean sea  and the second one probably brought by the arabs through north african countries , as previously proposed  <cit> . our findings are in agreement with earlier studies  <cit> , but not with the hypothesis proposed by kostina  <cit> , who reported only one major route from the irano-caucasian area to the mediterranean basin.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the three main identified gene pools, we observed a significant and substantial loss of apricot genetic diversity, ranging from about  <dig> to 49% from the secondary apricot diversification zone  to the southwestern mediterranean basin, depicting a genetic signature of apricot domestication and diffusion into the mediterranean basin. unlike kostina’s assumptions  <cit> , we propose an evolutionary scenario in favour of two diffusion routes in southern europe and north africa as revealed by a substantial proportion of shared alleles that were specifically detected along each of the two diffusion routes. our study generated genetic insight to:  improve management and conservation strategies for mediterranean apricot germplasm, and  propose a genetic basis for apricot breeding programs.
