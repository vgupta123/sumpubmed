BACKGROUND
topoisomerase type ii is an atpase of the ghkl -family that is evolutionary conserved in eukaryotes and essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis  <cit> . mammals express two topoisomerase type ii isoforms, alpha and beta, which are highly homologous but display differences in expression and in sub-cellular localization at the time of mitosis  <cit> . like topoisomerases type i and iii, the type ii enzyme can remove topological constraints on dna. however, it is the only enzyme that is capable of decatenating intertwined chromatids. catenations in sister chromatids arise during dna replication and must be removed to allow faithful chromosome segregation during anaphase  <cit> . topoisomerase ii is a homodimer that clamps onto two dna double strands upon atp binding to the amino-terminal atpase domains. subsequently, the enzyme transiently cleaves one of the dna double strands and, using the energy derived from atp hydrolysis, transports the second dna double strand through the gap. the cleaved strand is rapidly religated and the dna strands are released from the enzyme upon hydrolysis of the second molecule atp and dissociation of adp molecules  <cit> . drugs that interfere with topoisomerase ii function have been developed as antitumor agents and are in clinical use already for decades  <cit> . however, the vast majority of these drugs act by stabilizing the state in which the enzyme has introduced the dna double strand break and induce a so-called cleavable complex  <cit> . consequently, tumor cell death is triggered by the substantial dna damage elicited by the so-called topoisomerase ii poisons. despite broad antitumor activity, the use of topoisomerase ii poisons as cancer chemotherapy is limited by a narrow therapeutic window as concomitant damage to healthy cells and tissues is almost inevitable  <cit> .

drugs that inhibit topoisomerase ii function without inducing cleavable complexes are termed catalytic inhibitors  <cit> . these drugs are thought to impede a step in the catalytic cycle that precedes dna double strand scission and exert their antiproliferative effects by depleting the essential enzymatic function. such drugs are thought to mainly affect cells that are committed to undergo mitosis and recent data suggest that tumor cells with defects in certain checkpoint control mechanisms might be particularly sensitive to catalytic inhibitors  <cit> . it has been proposed that cells employ two distinct checkpoint mechanisms in g <dig> and m phase, respectively, in response to catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibition. in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle a "dna-decatenation checkpoint" is triggered that delays entry of cells into mitosis  <cit> . this checkpoint was shown to be caffeine sensitive and dependent on atm/atr , brca <dig>  and the wrn  helicase  <cit> . interestingly, in one study it was found that a fraction of lung cancer cell lines were hypersensitive toward the bisdioxopiperazine catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitor icrf- <dig>  <cit> . the hypersensitive cells failed to activate atm and to delay entry into mitosis upon incubation with icrf- <dig>  furthermore, recent evidence suggests that cells arrest in metaphase upon depletion of topoisomerase ii or treatment with the catalytic inhibitor icrf- <dig>  <cit> . the metaphase arrest was shown to be distinct from the spindle assembly checkpoint but nonetheless to be dependent on the checkpoint protein mad <dig>  <cit> . these data suggest that it may be possible to develop catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii as anticancer therapy to target tumors with the appropriate molecular alterations  <cit> .

the bisdioxopiperazines inhibit the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase ii by binding in proximity of the atp binding site and trapping the enzyme as a closed clamp on dna  <cit> . alternatively, the catalytic cycle can be halted by drugs that dock into the atp-binding pocket and prevent nucleotide binding. drugs that target bacterial dna-gyrase were shown to function by this mechanism of action and have been developed as antibiotics  <cit> . notably, recent data suggest that this approach should also be applicable to the eukaryotic enzyme  <cit> . starting from a homology model derived from dna-gyrase and subsequently using the yeast  <cit>  and more recently the human topoisomerase ii atpase domain crystal structures  <cit>  we have undertaken structure-based drug discovery efforts on this exciting target with the aim of identifying atp-competitive catalytic inhibitors. relying on an enzymatic atpase assay, these efforts have led to the discovery of novel designed purine diamino analogues as potent atp-competitive catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii. the quinoline aminopurine  <dig>  inhibited topoisomerase ii atpase activity as well as the decatenation reaction and targeted both topoisomerase ii alpha and beta isoforms in cell-free assays. importantly, qap  <dig> displayed catalytic enzyme inhibition in cells as shown by antagonism of doxorubicin-induced dna damage and aberrant chromosome segregation. finally, we show that breast tumor cells with a mutation in brca <dig> have increased sensitivity towards qap  <dig> as compared to cells reconstituted with brca <dig> 

RESULTS
screening for atp-competitive topoisomerase ii inhibitors using molecular modeling combined with an atpase assay
based on homology structural models of the target, a purine scaffold was designed interactively using the macromodel modeling software  <cit> . the designed purine scaffold was subsequently used as a substructure query to search the novartis compound collection. around  <dig> molecules were retrieved in this manner and screened in an atpase assay using purified full length tagged human topoisomerase ii alpha. screening this set of compounds resulted in two micromolar hits that were further optimized by structure-based design . submicromolar activity with an ic <dig> of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm in the atpase assay was obtained with the purine analogue  <dig> that is substituted with an ethyl group at position c <dig>  a tert-butyl group at position n <dig> and containing a benzothiazole group in position n <dig> . introduction of a morpholino-ethoxy group in the quinoline aminopurine  improved activity in the atpase assay to an ic <dig> of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm . subsequently, we carried out kinetic analysis with qap  <dig> in order to corroborate the mode of action. when the apparent km of topoisomerase ii for atp was determined in the presence of ic <dig> concentrations of qap  <dig>  an increase in the km from  <dig> ±  <dig> nm to  <dig> ±  <dig> nm was observed . the data were analyzed by non-linear regression analysis using the equations corresponding to competitive, uncompetitive, and mixed inhibition  and a statistical analysis  was carried out to identify the best model. these studies revealed that qap  <dig> is an atp-competitive inhibitor of topoisomerase ii. a linearized representation  of one of these experiments is depicted in figure 1d. to confirm the mode of action of qap  <dig>  inhibition studies were also carried out in the presence of different concentration of the inhibitor at different atp concentrations and the ic <dig> values were determined. figure 1e shows that, according to the cheng-prusoff equation for a linear competitive inhibitor  <cit> , the ic <dig> of qap  <dig> increases in a linear fashion with increasing atp concentrations. these data, together with the results presented in figure 1d suggest that qap  <dig> is an atp-competitive inhibitor. next, qap  <dig> was tested against a panel of kinases in a radiometric assay  <cit> . with the exception of subtle inhibition of the ret and c-src tyrosine kinases no effect of the compound was observed on other kinases in the panel, even at the highest concentration tested . thus, qap  <dig> is a relatively potent inhibitor of topoisomerase ii atpase function with fairly good selectivity over various serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinases. to test if qap  <dig> inhibited topoisomerase ii dna strand passage activity, nuclear extracts of hl- <dig> leukemic cells were incubated with catenated kdna in the presence of increasing concentrations of qap  <dig>  in this functional assay qap  <dig> was found to inhibit dna decatenation with a mean ic <dig> of  <dig> nm , which was in the range of the values measured with icrf- <dig>  <cit> , a non-atp competitive catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase ii and most potent bisdioxopiperazine described to date. similarly, in dna decatenation assays using the purified human topoisomerase ii alpha enzyme  a mean ic <dig> of  <dig> nm was determined for qap  <dig> 

qap  <dig> was profiled against a panel of serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinases. data typically represent means of two independent experiments ± sd.

qap  <dig> inhibits topoisomerase ii alpha and beta isoforms in a cell free assay
in mammals two topoisomerase ii isoforms exist, topoisomerase ii alpha and beta. the alpha isozyme is expressed in a cell-cycle regulated manner with highest levels of expression in g2/m. topoisomerase ii beta is expressed constitutively in differentiated and in proliferating cells. although mouse knockout studies have demonstrated that topoisomerase ii alpha but not beta is essential for cell proliferation  <cit> , recent sirna data suggest that the beta isoform can compensate when alpha is depleted in certain tumor cells  <cit> . in agreement with these findings, we have detected an antiproliferative effect and induction of polyploidy only after depletion of both topoisomerase ii isoforms using rnai in hela cells . however, the proposed partial compensation by the beta isoform does not occur in all cancer cell settings  <cit>  and could also be attributable to insufficient enzyme depletion in the alpha knockdown experiments. nonetheless, the fact that partial compensation might arise should be taken into consideration for drug discovery efforts; that is for cancer therapy with catalytic inhibitors, inhibition of both isoforms may be required. concurrent inhibition of topoisomerase ii alpha and beta should be achievable with atp-competitive catalytic inhibitors as the atpase domains display a high degree of homology. to ensure that the purine scaffold targeted both topoisomerase ii isoforms the biotinylated substituted purine analogue  <dig> was incubated with hl- <dig> nuclear extracts. using the biotinylated substituted purine analogue  <dig> it was possible to pull down topoisomerase ii alpha and beta isoforms . the interaction was lost when the nuclear extracts were incubated with an excess of non-biotinylated parent compound, purine analogue  <dig>  but not when incubated with an excess of the substituted purine analogue  <dig> that was inactive in the atpase assays . importantly, the interaction of biotinylated purine analogue  <dig> with both topoisomerase ii alpha and beta isoforms was abolished when qap  <dig> was incubated in excess or at equimolar concentrations .

qap  <dig> displays catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibition in a quantitative cell-based assay
although the enzymatic and biochemical cell free experiments show that qap  <dig> is a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase ii-mediated dna decatenation and targets both enzyme isoforms it is important to assess if the compound can inhibit topoisomerase ii in the cellular context. if cells are pretreated with catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors the amount of active enzyme on chromatin is sharply reduced. it is by this mechanism that catalytic inhibitors are thought to antagonize subsequent treatment with topoisomerase ii poisons  <cit> . dna damage in the form of double strand breaks is recognized by cellular surveillance mechanisms and "tagged" at the sites surrounding the break by posttranslational modification of histone h2ax in the form of ser <dig> phosphorylation   <cit> . in a first step, it was confirmed that the dna damage readout  induced by doxorubicin was suppressed by pretreatment of cells with the catalytic inhibitor tool compound icrf- <dig> . next, we corroborated that the induction of γh2ax by doxorubicin was strictly dependent on the target protein. since both topoisomerase ii isoforms contribute to dna damage elicited by anthracyclines  <cit> , hela cells were transfected either with control sirna or co-transfected with topoisomerase ii alpha and beta sirnas. after an incubation period of  <dig> hours the cells were treated with doxorubicin for two hours and then extracted for analysis of histones by western blotting. in cells depleted of both isoforms the induction of γh2ax signal by doxorubicin was substantially blunted, demonstrating that the dna-double strand breaks created by this drug in this experimental setting require topoisomerase ii . thus, the γh2ax readout can be used to profile novel catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii for cellular activity and to assess relative potency. in order to extend the method for higher throughput and a quantifiable format we adapted the assay to in cell western in  <dig> well plates  <cit> . cells were treated with increasing concentrations of either icrf- <dig> or qap  <dig> for  <dig>  hours or pretreated with the same dose range of either drug for  <dig> minutes prior to addition of  <dig> μm doxorubicin for  <dig> hours. cells were fixed, stained and then the γh2ax and to-pro signals were detected and quantified with the odyssey reader. icrf- <dig> suppressed the doxorubicin-induced γh2ax signal with a mean ic <dig> in the range of  <dig>  μm  and qap  <dig> displayed an ic <dig> value in the range of  <dig>  μm  . neither catalytic inhibitor elicited detectable γh2ax induction by itself using this assay, as assessed by comparing γh2ax signals with the signals in dmso treatment controls. however, we cannot rule out that detection of subtle dna damage in the form of few dna double strand breaks per cell is missed in the in cell western assay, as several groups have reported that bisdioxopiperazines can damage dna  <cit>  and high concentrations of icrf- <dig> were shown to induce γh2ax foci  <cit> . taken together, qap  <dig> targets topoisomerase ii in cells, however, the drug is less potent in the cellular context as compared to icrf- <dig> 

perturbation of chromosome segregation by qap  <dig> in a functional cellular assay
early work in yeast demonstrated that topoisomerase ii function is essential at the time of mitosis for chromosome segregation  <cit> . to assess if topoisomerase ii inhibition by qap  <dig> qualitatively resulted in aberrant chromosome segregation in cells, spreads were prepared at the time of mitosis. hl- <dig> cells were synchronized to the g1/s boundary by aphidicolin treatment and released into fresh medium. after  <dig> hours most cells had entered the g <dig> phase and mitosis was occurring by  <dig> hours as assessed by facs analysis and measuring the mitotic index . as a first step, icrf- <dig> was used to monitor the consequences of topoisomerase ii inhibition in this cellular system. when cells had been released for  <dig> hours and then treated with  <dig> μm icrf- <dig> and caffeine  for  <dig> hours no normal anaphases or telophases could be observed , indicating that the catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitor had prevented dna decatenation and timely normal chromosome segregation. this is seemingly consistent with recent evidence showing that topoisomerase ii depletion or icrf- <dig> treatment can delay cells in metaphase up to several hours in a mad <dig> dependent manner before they attempt cytokinesis  <cit> . however, at lower concentrations of icrf- <dig>  cells could be identified that had progressed beyond metaphase and anaphase. in the absence of a more detailed mechanistic understanding of the mad2-dependent topoisomerase ii metaphase checkpoint we can only speculate that this checkpoint might be leaky in hl- <dig> cells, allowing slippage and progression into anaphase despite compromised topoisomerase ii function. alternatively, checkpoint activation might require levels of catenated dna in mitosis to exceed a certain threshold, since cells normally enter mitosis with residual sister chromatid catenations that are only resolved at the time of metaphase to anaphase transition  <cit>  and during anaphase  <cit> . in the presence of low icrf- <dig> concentrations anaphases looked abnormal whereas in control treated cells two separating groups of chromatin were readily observable . presumably the abnormal anaphases are the consequence of anaphase bridging due to incomplete dna decatenation. cells were detected that successfully managed to progress to telophase as seen by the reconstitution of two adjacent nuclei containing decondensing dna without detectable signs of chromosome-bridging  but some cells also displayed obvious signs of chromosome miss-segregation  and cells were observed that failed entirely to segregate their chromosomes and reconstituted tetraploid nuclei . importantly, when cells were treated in g <dig> with  <dig> μm qap  <dig> mitosis was also severely perturbed during anaphase, which is consistent with topoisomerase ii inhibition . furthermore, although sister chromatid resolution occurred, metaphase chromosomes in qap  <dig> treated cells consistently appeared slightly less condensed as compared to control treated cells . this latter finding is in agreement with topoisomerase ii depletion studies and with earlier work using bisdioxopiperazines that imply a role for topoisomerase ii in the final compaction of chromosomes  <cit> . we believe that the concentrations of icrf- <dig> and qap  <dig> that evidently perturbed mitotic progression at anaphase and beyond relate relatively well with intracellular target inhibition and ensuing antiproliferative effects. indeed, in proliferation assays over  <dig> hours the half-maximal growth inhibitory concentration  was determined as  <dig> nm for icrf- <dig> and  <dig> μm for qap  <dig> in hl- <dig> cells.

brca <dig> mutant breast cancer cells display increased sensitivity to both non-atp-competitive and atp-competitive catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibition
given the findings that qap  <dig> targets topoisomerase ii catalytic function in cells we explored the action of the drug in a model of brca <dig> mutation. it has previously been shown that g <dig> dna decatenation checkpoint deficiency can confer hypersensitivity to the catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitor icrf- <dig>  <cit>  and that atr/brca <dig> are required to enforce this checkpoint  <cit> . brca <dig> mutant hcc <dig> breast cancer cells were previously shown to be deficient in the dna decatenation checkpoint and that this checkpoint is restored in hcc <dig> cells with reconstituted wild type brca <dig> expression  <cit> . in addition, brca <dig> appears to be important for regulating topoisomerase ii dna decatenation activity  <cit> . the effects of icrf- <dig> and qap  <dig> on brca <dig> mutant and brca <dig> reconstituted hcc <dig> cells were assessed in clonogenic growth assays. immunoprecipitation and western blotting with a combination of different brca <dig> antibodies was used to confirm that the hcc <dig> cells expressed mutant carboxyl-terminally truncated brca <dig> and that the brca <dig> reconstituted hcc <dig> expressed the full-length protein . analysis of nuclear extracts revealed that both cell lines expressed comparable levels of topoisomerase ii alpha and beta . in clonogenic growth assays, we observed that brca <dig> mutated cells were somewhat more sensitive towards icrf- <dig> as determined by measuring relative proliferation using the wst- <dig> reagent, a tetrazolium salt that is cleaved in mitochondria of metabolically active cells, and by counting colony numbers after crystal violet staining . encouragingly, qap  <dig> also displayed a differential antiproliferative effect on brca <dig> mutant versus brca <dig> reconstituted cells and this effect was most evident at a concentration of  <dig> μm . at this dose of the compound a striking suppression of colony formation of brca <dig> mutant cells was seen. in contrast, the hsp <dig> inhibitor 17-aag affected growth of brca <dig> mutant and brca <dig> reconstituted cells to a similar extent , suggesting that the effects seen with the catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors were not due to a general hypersensitivity of brca <dig> mutant cells towards anti-proliferative agents.

discussion
the novel rationally designed purine analogue qap  <dig> was found to inhibit human topoisomerase ii dna-dependent atpase activity and dna decatenation in vitro with submicromolar ic50s and to inhibit the enzyme with an atp-competitive mode of action. although purine analogues have recently been described as catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii  <cit> , to our best knowledge qap  <dig> represents the most potent and selective example of this chemotype described to date. interestingly, topoisomerase ii dimers consisting of one wild-type and one atpase dead molecule have been found to still be capable of carrying out dna strand passage reactions in vitro  <cit> . this suggests that atp-competitive inhibitors may need to attain intracellular concentrations that saturate both atp-binding sites of the topoisomerase ii dimer for efficient inhibition of dna decatenation, whereas a single bisdioxopiperazine molecule binds and bridges the atp-associated dimer molecules  <cit> .

in vitro qap  <dig> displayed greater than  <dig> fold selectivity over a standard panel of kinases, although some inhibition of the ret and src tyrosine kinases was observed. further optimization will be required to reach low nanomolar potency toward topoisomerase ii while improving selectivity over kinases. the recently described crystal structure of the human topoisomerase ii atpase domain is expected to aid such drug discovery efforts  <cit> ; co-crystallization with purine scaffolds will be crucial to corroborate binding mode and provide further impetus for lead optimization.

cellular activity of qap  <dig> was demonstrated by antagonism of topoisomerase ii poison-induced dna damage and aberrant chromosome segregation, even though icrf- <dig> was more potent in both of these assays. on the other hand, in the clonogenic growth assays qap  <dig> and icrf- <dig> affected brca <dig> mutant cells to a comparable extent at a concentration of  <dig> μm. although the bisdioxopiperazine class catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii are used for the treatment of adult t-cell leukemia in japan, their use in other cancer indications has been limited to the modulation of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity  <cit> . a key issue in the development of catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase ii is that, although the enzyme is clearly druggable, it is currently not obvious which tumors bearing which kind of molecular alterations will respond particularly well to such drugs and what the effects on normal cells and stem cells will be  <cit> . it is anticipated that catalytic inhibitors will show less side effects compared to topoisomerase ii poisons but will also display a narrower anti-tumor spectrum. importantly, concepts for exploiting the anti-proliferative activity of catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors based on molecular characteristics of the tumor cell have recently started to emerge  <cit> . the discovery of checkpoint mechanisms in g <dig> and m phase that appear to protect cells transiently from progressing into and through mitosis in the absence of catalytic topoisomerase ii function is a promising starting point  <cit> . the finding that brca <dig> mutant cells displayed slightly increased sensitivity to qap  <dig> supports a role of the protein in the response to catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibition. interestingly, brca <dig> appears to have a dual link to topoisomerase ii in that it is required  to enforce the dna decatenation checkpoint and  to directly regulate topoisomerase ii activity by ubiquitination  <cit> . takahashi and colleagues have observed remarkable hypersensitivity of a subset of lung cancer cells to icrf- <dig>  the hypersensitive cell lines lacked dna decatenation checkpoint function and appeared to have impaired atm activation in response to icrf- <dig> treatment  <cit> . however, these cannot be the only criteria since it was found that overriding the dna decatenation checkpoint with caffeine was not sufficient to render non-sensitive cells hypersensitive to the catalytic inhibitor  <cit> . thus, more research will be required to unravel the molecular alterations predictive of a particularly good response to catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors and the icrf- <dig> hypersensitive cell lines alluded to above could be invaluable tools for this purpose. finally, given the findings of several groups that bisdioxopiperazines can interfere with dna metabolism and damage dna  <cit>  and that stem and progenitor cells have an inefficient decatenation checkpoint  <cit> , it will be important to determine the effects of atp-competitive catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors in these settings. the potential therapeutic value of potent and selective atp-competitive inhibitors will also be determined by their impact on non-tumor cells versus sensitive tumor cells in pre-clinical models.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we describe a novel purine diamine analogue, termed qap  <dig>  which emerged from molecular modeling efforts as a potent catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase ii alpha and beta. the inhibitor blocks topoisomerase ii atpase and decatenation activity in biochemical assays and depletes enzyme function in cellular systems. in particular, we show that qap  <dig> antagonizes anthracycline-mediated dna damage as assessed by suppression of γh2ax induction and perturbs chromosome segregation. the inhibitor qap  <dig> represents a promising starting point for lead optimization campaigns and further drug discovery efforts. importantly, the atp-competitive catalytic inhibitor also represents a novel tool, with distinct mechanism of action as compared to bisdioxopiperazines, to assess the effects of topoisomerase ii inhibition in cancer cells and in normal cells. it is the prevailing view that tumor cell sensitivity to catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors may be attributed to cell lineage and/or specific checkpoint defects. in agreement with previous analyses, the present study shows that brca <dig> mutant cells display increased sensitivity to catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors. however, many questions remain regarding the checkpoint mechanisms postulated to monitor dna topology in g <dig> and m cell cycle phases, respectively. atp-competitive catalytic topoisomerase ii inhibitors such as qap  <dig> could be instrumental to screen tumor cell lines and, combined with genetic as well as molecular studies, help identify tumor settings with increased susceptibility.
