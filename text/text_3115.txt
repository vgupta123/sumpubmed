BACKGROUND
dna methylation is the addition of a methyl group  to the 5's cytocine  at a cg site. it can be inherited without changing the original dna sequences. this epigenetic modification plays an important role in regulating gene expression, and it may cause tumor suppressor gene silencing  <cit> . over the last two decades, many biological and computational studies have been done to investigate the methylation patterns in different tissues. these studies either focus on candidate genes such as p <dig> and rassf1a  <cit>  or on different chromosomes  <cit> . most of these studies focus on cancer since methylation patterns are changed in neoplasia. these changes may include regional or genome-wide gain or loss of methylation  <cit> . in order to gain a genome-wide understanding of how changes in methylation affect tumor growth, the dmh protocol  <cit>  has been used to simultaneously assay the methylation status of all known cgis, genomic regions rich in cg sites  <cit> .

previous dmh microarray studies mainly focus on identifying genes that are differentially methylated between normal individuals and cancer patients . they identify the genes that are hypermethylated  or hypomethylated . the data analysis of these studies mainly focuses on identifying dm genes by identifying dm probes. for example, an arbitrary log ratio cut off of  <dig>  has been used  <cit> , and a gamma-normal-gamma model has been applied to identify differentially methylated probes  <cit> . however, a single high or low log ratio probe may not represent true biological signals due to the large impact of probe affinity. this is because the intensity of each probe is related to its sequence, and different microarray probes may have similar sequences. therefore, both specific and non-specific binding could occur. with non-specific binding, two probes against the same region  may have very different intensity values. this issue has been well known and has been addressed in the context of gene expression microarrays  <cit> . in addition to probe affinity, other factors such as the polymerase chain reaction  application effect, sample preparations, and the sensitivity of scanners will also affect probe intensities  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that neighboring probes are highly correlated over hundreds of bases  <cit> . as a result, we can not assume that all probes are independent. in addition, because cancer patients or cell lines may have different levels of methylation signals, it is important to consider random effects in the model too.

unlike previous dmh studies, this paper focuses on identifying genes that are differentially methylated between two tumor subtypes  rather than between normal and cancerous cells. we propose a novel method for identifying a dm gene by pooling all probes in its associated cgi together and incorporating the correlation structures for probes in the same cgi. to implement this method, we apply two mixed effect models and two generalized least square models to incorporate the heterogeneity of different arrays  and study the correlation structures between probes. we compare the results of these four models with the ones obtained from a simple least square regression model and find that it is important to incorporate the random effect and choose a correlation structure properly.

methods
dmh microarray protocol, data preprocessing and description
microarray technology has brought about a revolution in our understanding of normal and abnormal molecular processes. with the aid of this technology, it is now possible to identify dna methylation patterns in specific regions of chromosomes or even in the entire genome. the dmh protocol  <cit>  utilizes restriction enzymes to reduce the complexity of the genome while preserving gc-rich regions  for methylation profiling. a brief outline of the dmh protocol is described below:

step 1
genomic dna samples are sonicated into 400- <dig> bp fragments, and linkers are ligated to these fragments.

step 2
the methylation status of the genome of interest can be investigated by methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. in this particular study, the investigation is achieved with two methylation sensitive enzymes, hpaii and hinpi, which have the recognition sites of ccgg and cgcg, respectively. these restriction enzymes will cut all of these cg-containing sites if the cs are not methylated. these enzymes will therefore remove all linker-ligated fragments containing unmethylated cg dinucleotides, leaving behind fragments that are 100% methylated or those that have no hpaii and hinpi recognition sites.

step 3
the dna fragments that are not restricted are then enriched with the polymerase chain reaction  to provide sufficient materials for fluorescent labeling and microarray hybridization. the dmh protocol is applied to both test samples  and control samples . both types of samples are labeled with their respective fluorescent dyes: cy <dig> dye pseudo-colored as red for test samples and cy <dig> dye pseudo-colored as green for control samples. they are then combined in equal quantity and competitively hybridized to a prepared microarray slide, in particular, an agilent  <dig> k human cgi array.

in total, there are about  <dig>  probes that span  <dig>  cgis found in the human genome. the majority  of cgis are covered by at most  <dig> probes. this information is summarized in table  <dig>  there is one probe within every  <dig> bp region per cgi, and the length of probe sequences ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. for each probe, we use the base two log ratio of red over green intensity, log <dig>  as the observed methylation signal. large positive log ratios show that there are more methylations in test samples  than in control samples . this means that there are strong hypermethylation signals in test samples. in contrast, large negative log ratios indicate that there are less methylations in test than in control samples, implying that there are strong hypomethylation signals in test samples. several consecutive probes are expected to have similar positive  log ratios because the dna fragments that are hybridized to the array are about 400- <dig> bp.

list of the count and proportion of all  <dig> cgis that have  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  and more than  <dig> probes.

in our example data,  <dig> breast cancer cell line microarrays are divided into two tumor subtypes, basal-like and luminal types  <cit> . each group has  <dig> arrays. for each array, the background correction is done using the "edwards method"  <cit> . dye effects are corrected using the standard within array loess normalization in the bioconductor package "limma"  <cit> . the between array normalization is done using the quantile method  <cit> .

in order to demonstrate the heterogeneous methylation patterns in different tumor subtypes and the variability in cell lines, we plot the normalized data of one cgi associated with the gene foxd <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  in this figure, the probes are ordered according to their physical location. the left three plots are for luminal cell lines, and the right three plots are for basal-like ones. neighboring probes in each cell line tend to have similar methylation signals. cell lines belonging to the same tumor subtypes have similar methylation patterns. for example, the methylation signals of the three luminal cell lines are stronger than the ones in the basal-like subtype. our goal is to identify those cgis  that are differentially methylated between two tumor subtypes.

statistical models
in order to identify differentially methylated genes between two tumor subtypes, we propose the idea of identifying differentially methylated cgis associated with them. that is, we build models to identify differentially methylated cgis, then determine whether a gene is methylated  by examining if there is any significant methylation difference at the cgi associated with this gene. this method is different from the others that identify differentially methylated genes by focusing on identifying differentially methylated probes. instead, we put the information of all probes at each cgi together to conduct analysis using different mixed effect and generalized least square models.

a mixed effect model includes fixed effect and random effect. a fixed effect is usually a well-defined population factor with finite levels. we are interested in estimating different levels of a fixed effect and testing to see if they are significantly different. for example, in our dmh data the tumor subtype factor, which has two levels, basal-like and luminal types, is a fixed effect and we want to test to see if the methylation levels of these two subtypes are significantly different from each other. a random effect is related to some individual experiment units that are selected from a larger  underlying population and represent a certain amount of random variation. for example, the cell lines  within each subgroup can be thought of as random samples from their representative population. however, we are not particularly interested in the differences between the cell lines within the same population. as such, a random effect component is included to model the variability. the inclusion of a random effect can help us generalize the analysis result to the whole population.

furthermore, each cell line can be considered as a "block" of probes, which will allow us to investigate the correlation structure between probes within the same array. alternatively, a generalized least square model can also be used to study correlations among probes of a cgi within the same cell line/array. various models may be used to study such correlations. in this paper, we apply two commonly used structures. one is "compound-symmetry" correlation; that is, all within-group errors are assumed to have equal correlations. another one is based on the autoregressive model in which we assume data points are observed at integer time  points, and the current observation is a linear function of previous ones and an error term  <cit> .

although we know neighboring probes are correlated, it is still unclear what specific correlation structure is the best fit. in addition, it is not clear how the random variation among different cell lines  will affect the analysis results. therefore, we explore the following four models:  the mixed effect model with the array effect as a random effect, m <dig> ;  the mixed effect model with the array effect as a random effect and the probe correlation structure modeled using an autoregressive model of order one , m <dig> ;  the generalized least square model with a compound symmetry correlation structure, m <dig> ; and  the generalized least square model with an ar <dig> model of correlation structure, m <dig> .

in the following four models, we use g to represent the group index with g =  <dig> and  <dig> corresponding to tumor subtypes: basal-like and luminal types. likewise, p is the probe index . a is the array  index . αg and βp represent the group and probe effects, and they are fixed effects. γa is the random effect. εgpa is the residual error. γa and εgpa are independent in all models.

. m <dig> : it is the mixed effect model,

ygpa = αg + βp + γa + εgpa,  for any a, and  for any g, p and a. the correlation structure is

therefore, the correlation between any two different probes  at each cgi is .

. m <dig> : it is the mixed effect model with an ar <dig> correlation structure, ygpa = αg + βp + γa + εgpa,  for any a, and  for any g, p and a.

the ar <dig> model is used for the correlation structure of residual errors, so that

therefore, the correlation between any two different probes  at each cgi is , where ρ is the correlation between two consecutive residual errors, that is,

. m <dig> : it is the generalized least square model with a compound symmetry correlation structure: ygpa = αg + βp + εgpa,  for any g, p and a. the correlation structure is

therefore, the correlation between any two different probes  at each cgi is ρ <dig> 

. m <dig> : it is the generalized least square model with an ar <dig> correlation structure: ygpa = αg + βp + εgpa,  for any g, p and a. the correlation structure is

therefore, the correlation between any two different probes  at each cgi is .

for the above models, we are interested in testing the null hypothesis  that there is no methylation difference between the two tumor subtypes, i.e., α <dig> = α <dig>  at each cgi. if the test p-value of one cgi is less than a certain threshold, then it is indicative of strong evidence that this cgi and its associated gene are differentially methylated between two tumor subtypes. all the above mixed effect models and generalized least square models are implemented for each cgi using the r package "nlme"  <cit> .

RESULTS
comparisons of different models
in order to see the impact of using different correlation structures and including or excluding random effects, we compare the above four models with the simple least square regression model m <dig> , which does not incorporate any correlation structure and only has fixed effects, that is, ygpa = αg + βp + εgpa,  for any g, p and a. the test results of all five models, that is, the numbers of cgis with p-values <  <dig> , are summarized in table  <dig>  the overlaps of these models are shown in figure  <dig>  in addition, we also plot the p-values of all cgis from four models  against the p-values of the model m <dig>  which does not incorporate correlations between probes . the two top plots of this figure are the models with random effects included . the model m <dig> has larger p-values than m <dig> at all cgis, while the model m <dig> has larger p-values than m <dig> at most cgis. the two bottom plots of figure  <dig> are the models without any random effect included. these plots show that, compared with the linear model , models m <dig> and m <dig> have some cgis with larger p-values and some with smaller ones than m <dig> 

the mixed effect models  identify roughly half as many dm cgis as identified by the non-random effect models . this could be due to the fact that these mixed effect models include the random effect to incorporate the variation of different cell line samples. when the random effect is included, a positive correlation structure is introduced to the model. therefore, we tend to get larger p-values. this is useful in reducing bias due to the noise, which could be caused by many unmeasured factors, and may introduce improper negative correlations that may not be consistent with the underlying methylation pattern and the dmh microarray protocol.

because the mixed effect models appear to be better suited for the purpose of analyzing cgi methylation data, we focus on further comparing m <dig> with m <dig>  we find that  <dig> cgis are obtained from the model m <dig> but not from m <dig>  the majority  of which have correlations equal to zero in the m <dig> model and most of which  have positive correlation estimates in m2; for those  <dig> cgis that are selected by the model m <dig> but not by m <dig>  the majority  have correlations equal to zero in the m <dig> model, and most of those  <dig> cgis  have negative correlations in model m <dig> .

relationship between correlation estimates and the number of probes
in the previous section we explore and compare the results and features of those four different models  using the linear model m <dig> as the base line. the comparison results show that the p-values are related to the correlation structures . as far as the correlation between probes is concerned, our understanding about the microarray protocol is that this might be related to the number of probes at each cgi. according to the dmh protocol, several consecutive probes  in the same cgi are meant to have similar log ratios; that is, they are all positive  and have similar values. however, for much longer cgis with many probes, the methylation pattern can vary along the cgi; that is, there could be very strong methylation signals in one end of the cgi, but not many signals in the other end. for the shorter cgis with only  <dig> or  <dig> probes, the methylation signals of these probes are supposed to be similar. however, our exploration of the data shows that this may not be true due to the noise of the data. in order to fully understand the relationship between the correlation estimate and number of probes at each cgi, we make plots for all cgis as shown in figure  <dig> 

in figure  <dig>  "a" is the correlation estimates of the model m <dig>  that is, the estimates of the intra-class correlation, , for all cgis. these estimates are only related to the variances of the random effect and the residual error, so they are all positive. "b" is the correlation estimates  of the model m <dig> for all cgis, some of which have positive correlations, while the others have negative ones. "c" is the correlation estimates of the model m <dig> for all cgis, the majority of which are positive. "d" is the correlation estimates of the model m <dig> for all cgis. about half of these estimates are positive and half are negative.

in order to explore whether the negative or positive correlation estimates have a major impact on the final conclusion of the significant differentially methylated cgis, we study the cgis with p <  <dig>  in models m <dig> and m <dig>  that is, those  <dig> cgis with p <  <dig>  in model m <dig>  and those  <dig> cgis with p <  <dig>  in model m <dig> . in fact, those  <dig> cgis from m <dig> are part of those  <dig> cgis. for the remainder of those  <dig> cgis, 85%  of them have negative correlation; that is, the  <dig> small p-values from model m <dig> are mainly due to the negative correlations. besides the comparisons of models m <dig> and m <dig>  we also compare models m <dig> and m <dig>  there are  <dig> cgis with p <  <dig>  in m <dig> , and  <dig> cgis with p <  <dig>  in m <dig> . among these cgis,  <dig> cgis from model m <dig> are in fact part of those  <dig> cgis from m <dig>  they have p <  <dig>  in both models m <dig> and m <dig>   <dig> cgis have p <  <dig>  only in the m <dig>  model, but not in m <dig> . figure  <dig> shows that, for those  <dig> cgis, the correlation estimates from m <dig> are similar to the ones from m <dig>  however, these  <dig> cgis have much larger p-values in the model m <dig> than in m <dig>  this may be due to the fact that microarray samples are heterogeneous and the model m <dig> does not include random effects.

assessing false discovery rate
as shown in the previous section, the inclusion  of random effects and the choice of correlation structure can greatly affect the results. therefore, it is very important to access the false discovery rate  of all models. in order to do so, we borrow some information from housekeeping  genes and treat them as known "non-differentially methylated genes". this is because hk genes are known to maintain the basic function of a cell and are relatively stable, so their methylation signals are not supposed to be very different between two groups. figure  <dig> shows the methylation pattern of a hk gene, where the log ratios of most probes in all six cell lines  are close to zero. in this paper, we use  <dig> hk genes selected from  <dig> such genes  <cit> . these  <dig> genes are associated with only one cgi and there is at least one promoter probe. the results of comparing the five models using  <dig> hk genes are listed in table  <dig>  this table shows that the mixed effect models  identify fewer hk genes. in particular, the number of dm hk genes obtained from the model m <dig> is half as many as that identified by models m <dig> and m <dig>  leading to a smaller false discovery rate. this result is consistent with the one shown in table 2; that is, the number of cgis identified by non-random effect models  is about twice as large as the one identified by the model m <dig>  these results suggest that mixed effect models may be more appropriate for modelling the variability among cell lines within the same group compared to the other models.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we propose a new method for identifying differentially methylated genes by identifying differentially methylated cgis. with this method, we can consider the information of all probes in each cgi as a whole. one advantage of this method is that we can add a "probe" factor to account for the noise and variation due to many unmeasured factors . another advantage is that we can model the correlation between probes in the same array at each cgi. our comparison results do show that this is necessary as the correlations between probes can affect the test results significantly.

because cancer cell lines or patient samples are in general heterogeneous, they may have very different levels of methylation. hence, the inclusion  of random effects is crucial in the data analysis. our assessment of the false discovery rate using hk genes also shows that the mixed effect models  have relatively smaller false discover rates. therefore, we recommend using a mixed effect model instead of a generalized least square model. as for whether to use m <dig> or m <dig>  we recommend using the model m <dig> for the following two reasons. first, according to the dmh protocol, the consecutive probes are supposed to be positively correlated. second, the ar <dig> model could be too specific for this type of noisy and complex data; that is, 'forcing' a specific model like ar <dig> to identify the local correlation may not be proper. as for the selected candidate cgis , we recommend ignoring short cgis that have only three or four probes and have zero correlation estimates or investigating them more carefully. we suggest this since methylation signals should be very similar within 300- <dig> bases  and such a zero correlation estimate is more than likely due to noise.

as for the sensitivity, it is very important to access this with genes that are known to be differentially methylated between two tumor subtypes. currently, we do not have such a list of genes. instead, we make use of some known biological information about methylation patterns  <cit>  and the dmh protocol  <cit>  to make the above suggestions. one key assumption of linear models is normality. in order to validate the assumption, we used the kolmogrov-smironov  test on the residuals of the m <dig>  model. after the "bh" multiple test correction  <cit> , no cgis fail the ks test. therefore, it is reasonable to assume the normal distribution.

after the within-array and between-array normalization, outlying probes are selected and deleted if there is at least one observation falling out of this range , where k =  <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> are the 25% and 75% quantiles of the log ratios of all probes in one cgi. note that we choose k =  <dig>  which is larger than the usual inter quartile range . with k =  <dig>  we mean to delete those probes that have outlying observations due to noise but retain those with certain variations for further modeling.

the main focus of this paper is to address the importance of incorporating random effects and correlations in our statistical models and to see how this affects the analysis results. therefore, the numbers of dm cgis presented in table  <dig> are the summary based on the raw p-values, and we have not done any multiple test correction. if we were to conduct multiple test corrections, especially using a stringent method, we expected that not many cgis would be selected any more. this could be due to two reasons. first, the underlying biological truth is that the effect size is too small to survive any multiple test corrections. second, the sample size may not be large enough to separate two tumor subtypes. for example, it has been shown that among  <dig> cancer patients, only about 1/ <dig> ~1/ <dig> of them have stronger methylation signals than normal individuals at the cst <dig> gene transcription start site  of  <cit> ). generally speaking, two types of cancerous cells are much more similar than cancerous and normal cells, so many more samples might be needed to really separate the methylation patterns of two tumor subtypes.

in this paper, we implement four models  in all  <dig>  cgis, which have at least three probes. for each cgi, a p-value is obtained at each model to indicate whether there is a significant methylation difference between two tumor subtypes. the p-values for long cgis  may not have the same meaning as the ones for the shorter cgis . we also discover that the long cgis easily fail the ks normality test  and have relatively smaller r <dig>  therefore, we recommend utilizing the following two methods to deal with long cgis. first, break the long cgis into a few parts with each part consisting of several probes . second, fit the linear model to probes at each cgi using only the probes that are located in the promoter or first exon region of certain genes, and if necessary, divide them into small parts. there are only a small percentage of cgis  with more than  <dig> probes, so this will not affect our conclusion about the relationship between correlation estimates and the number of probes.

there are other hk gene lists provided by some recent papers  <cit> . after comparing the lists from these papers with the one we used  <cit> , we found our hk gene list is still a better choice for our purpose because it has the following two advantages. first, it is obtained using relatively a larger number of tissues than the ones used in  <cit> . second, the microarray data set used in  <cit>  has replicates which helps reduce some measurement noise, making results more trustworthy.

the overlap of those significantly differentially methylated cgis obtained from all five models is in fact the overlap of the cgis from models m <dig> and m <dig>  which are  <dig> cgis. these cgis are associated with  <dig> genes with known annotations. ten genes sets  are enriched using the molecular signature database  to conduct the gene set overlapping analysis http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/ . several of these pathways are also identified by other breast cancer gene expression analysis methods that incorporate the pathway information  <cit> . this indicates that the methylation signatures of the genes in these ten pathways could play a very important role in breast cancer studies. in addition, six genes  are enriched in at least two pathways. five of these six genes are closely related to various cancers. in particular, pik3r <dig>  which is enriched in four pathways, belongs to the pik <dig> gene family that plays an important regulatory role in various cancer related signalling pathways  <cit> . it has recently been identified as a significant negative prognosis factor for ovarian cancer  <cit> . kdr, also known as vegfr <dig> gene, is important in tumor angiogenesis  <cit> . due to its crucial role in angiogenesis, kdr could be used as the molecular target of early diagnosis and treatment in cancer  <cit> . epor is the receptor of the recombinant human erythropoietin  that is used to treat tumor related anemia  <cit> . the mpl mutation occurs in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia  <cit> . aberrant bmp <dig> promoter cgi methylation has been found in both colon cancer and gastric cell lines, and the resultant loss of bmp <dig> expression may be related to gastric carcinogenesis  <cit> .

cgis could cover different parts of genes, and cgis from promoter regions may differ from those found in the gene body with respect to their methylation levels and neighboring probe correlation levels. however, this does not affect the performance of our models since they are completely general and analyze each cgi separately. therefore, they can accommodate the methylation level differences and probe correlation strength for each cgi. after the analysis is done, we can do further bioinformatic studies for the cgis we identified. for example, we can investigate the relationship between cgi locations and probe correlation estimates. studying the genes identified by the model m <dig>  we found that 45% of promoter cgis have a positive correlation estimate, and 55% of non-promoter cgis have a positive correlation. this may indicate that the probe correlation estimates are location dependent.

although we have only presented the implementation and comparisons of the models in one data set in this paper to focus our discussion, in fact, we have done the same analysis and comparison on an endometrial cancer data set of two racial groups  and got the same conclusions. in addition, although the results of this paper are mainly for the dmh microarray data, the methods could be applied to data generated by the other methylation microarray protocols such as methylated dna immunoprecipitation  assay.
