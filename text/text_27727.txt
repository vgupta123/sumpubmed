BACKGROUND
common bean  is the most important leguminous food crop grown for dry seed worldwide, both in acreage and yield. historically, this species has been an important model for the study of seed storage proteins  <cit> . in commercial cultivars, the 7s globulin phaseolin constitutes approximately half of total seed protein. lectins are also abundant, with phytohemagglutinins and α-amylase inhibitors accounting for 10% and 5% of seed protein, respectively. like in other grain legumes, the content of essential sulfur amino acids is sub-optimal for nutrition. a strategy proposed to improve protein quality and bioavailability of sulfur amino acids consists in the selection and breeding of highly-digestible phaseolin types  <cit> . a different approach may rely on variation in storage protein composition.

osborn et al. developed genetically related lines integrating mutations conferring a deficiency in phaseolin and major lectins, which are encoded by unique loci  <cit> . the arcelin-phytohemagglutinin-α-amylase inhibitor  locus was introgressed from g <dig>  a wild accession containing arcelin- <dig>  into the commercial cultivar sanilac , to generate the sarc <dig> line. recessive mutations from phaseolus coccineus and 'great northern 1140' were introgressed into the sarc <dig> background, conferring a deficiency in phaseolin and lectins, respectively. smarc1-pn <dig> lacks phaseolin and smarc1n-pn <dig> lacks phaseolin, phytohemagglutinin and arcelin. sarc <dig>  smarc1-pn <dig> and smarc1n-pn <dig> share a similar level  of the recurrent parental sanilac background. introgression of the apa locus containing arcelin- <dig> from wild p. vulgaris is associated with resistance to major storage pests, the weevils zabrotes subfasciatus and acanthoscelides obtectus  <cit> . however, in the absence of detailed molecular information about the apa locus, the identity of the lectin conferring this resistance remains elusive  <cit> .

the deficiency in phaseolin and major lectins, phytohemagglutinin and arcelin, results in a nearly two-fold increase in sulfur amino acid content in seed, particularly of cys, elevated by 70%, and met, by 10%  <cit> . this takes place mostly at the expense of s-methyl-cys, an abundant non-protein amino acid which cannot substitute for met or cys in the diet  <cit> . proteomic analysis revealed that the lack of phaseolin and major lectins was mainly compensated by increases in the 11s globulin legumin and residual lectins, particularly the β subunit of α-amylase inhibitor- <dig>  α-amylase inhibitor-like protein, mannose lectin fril, and leucoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin encoded by pdlec <dig>  <cit> . several proteins contributing to the increased cys content including legumin, albumin- <dig>  defensin and albumin- <dig> were identified on the basis of similarity to related proteins from other legumes. based on quantification by 2-d gel electrophoresis, legumin levels were raised by 3-fold, to 17% of total protein, while albumin- <dig> was elevated by 10-fold, to  <dig> % of total protein. defensin and albumin- <dig> could not be quantified accurately as they were characterized from selective extracts.

a significant number of expressed sequence tags  have been generated from root, leaf and pod of common bean  <cit> , but a similar resource is lacking for the seed, despite its nutritional importance. in addition, transcript profiling studies of common bean using high density arrays have so far relied on cross-specific hybridization to soybean platforms  <cit> , in part due to a lack of relevant sequence information. the objective of this study was to generate a common bean est collection which would provide a foundation to further investigate the metabolism of sulfur amino acids in developing seeds, by using a functional genomic approach. four seed developmental stages were sampled in the reference genotype bat <dig>  <cit> , corresponding to distinct stages of accumulation of γ-glu-s-methyl-cys, the major soluble form of s-methyl-cys. in silico analysis revealed the occurrence of several pathways of sulfur metabolism ranging from sulfate assimilation to glutathione biosynthesis. analysis of est clusters provided detailed information on the identity and abundance of storage protein transcripts. integration with proteomic data enabled isolation of cdnas coding for legumin, albumin- <dig>  defensin and albumin- <dig> isoforms which are elevated in the absence of phaseolin and major lectins. these proteins have a higher cys than met content, providing an explanation for the preferential increase of cys in smarc1n-pn <dig> 

RESULTS
selection of seed developmental stages and generation of ests
free amino acids were profiled at eight developmental stages of bat <dig> seed, to identify stages suitable to generate ests . developmental stages are designated after walbot et al.  <cit> . according to this nomenclature, storage protein transcripts reach their maximal levels between stages iv  to vi , while storage products are accumulated between stages v  to vii   <cit> . during stage viii  the seed undergoes desiccation. amino acid content was normalized over the average of developmental stages, expressed in log <dig> scale, and k-means analysis performed to reveal common developmental patterns. amino acids were grouped into five clusters . the levels of most free amino acids decreased markedly between stages v to vii during which protein reserves are actively accumulated. the nitrogen-rich amino acids, arg, his and lys formed a cluster with phe. amino acids in this cluster were characterized by a marked rise in their levels during the transition to seed desiccation and dormancy. the second and third clusters contained central intermediates in amino acid metabolism, ser, glu, ala, gln and asn, along with leu and met. their levels generally decreased throughout seed development. this decline was more pronounced for amino acids in the third cluster which included met. γ-glu-s-methyl-cys and γ-glu-leu formed a unique cluster as their levels rose throughout seed development. γ-glu-s-methyl-cys showed a biphasic curve of accumulation, with a continuous rise until stage v, followed by a plateau until stage vii, and a resumption of accumulation from stage viii . in comparison, the levels of free s-methyl-cys were high at stages iii and iv, and decreased at stages v and vi, in parallel with met levels.

four developmental stages were selected to generate ests, corresponding to distinct phases of γ-glu-s-methyl-cys accumulation: stage iv - cotyledon  and stage v - cotyledon , coinciding with early γ-glu-s-methyl-cys accumulation, stage vi - maturation , coinciding with the lag phase, and stage viii - maturation , coinciding with the resumption of accumulation. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests were generated for each respective developmental stage. of these, gene ontology  annotation from arabidopsis  <cit>  was retrieved for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests, respectively. assembly of the total  <dig>  ests yielded  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons.

in silico analysis of ests identifies features of sulfur and amino acid metabolism in developing seeds
the representation of general go categories of biological process and molecular function was analyzed during seed development. the percentage of ests assigned to a go category  was normalized to the average over seed development, expressed in log <dig> scale and submitted to hierarchical clustering analysis . categories of cellular metabolism, primary metabolism, macromolecule metabolism and cellular protein metabolism clustered together. their representation suggested that general metabolic activity was highest at stage iv, progressively decreased until stage vi and then increased at stage viii. the same general trend was observed for the categories of amino acid and sulfur compound metabolic processes. the decline in metabolic activity coincided with accumulation of storage products. indeed, the nutrient reservoir activity category was most highly represented at stage vi, followed by stage v. the latter clustered away from all other categories. hormone biosynthesic process also had a unique profile, being highest at the first stage of development and markedly down at the last two stages. the percentage of ests assigned to the category of photosynthesis was highest at stage iv, followed by stage v, and further decreased at stages vi and viii, consistent with the loss of chlorophyll pigmentation in cotyledons during seed maturation  <cit> . interestingly, categories of photosynthesis, response to oxidative stress and response to radiation were grouped together. the category of response to water deprivation had highest levels at stage viii, corresponding to seed desiccation. analysis of go categories related to the supply of nitrogen to developing seeds indicated that ureide catabolism, comprising allantoinase and allantoicase activities, was most highly represented at stage v, coinciding with the onset of storage protein accumulation, whereas the percentage of ests associated with asparaginase activity increased steadily until stage vi, the mid-point of storage protein accumulation .

five different go categories were associated with arg metabolism . of these, argininosuccinate lyase activity, the last step in arg biosynthesis, was represented by a high percentage of ests at stage iv, of  <dig> %. this correlates with an increase in steady-stage arg levels between stages iii to v . analysis of categories related to sulfur metabolism indicated that all enzymatic activities associated with sulfur assimilation, de novo cys and met biosynthesis were represented in the est dataset . these include sulfate adenylyltransferase, adenylyl-sulfate reductase and sulfite reductase; ser o-acetyltransferase and cys synthase; and cystathionine γ-synthase, cystathionine β-lyase and met synthase. homocysteine s-methyltransferase, involved in the production of met via the s-methylmethionine cycle, the catabolic enzyme met γ-lyase and the two enzymes involved in glutathione biosynthesis, glu-cys ligase and glutathione synthase, were also represented.

analysis of seed protein ests
clustering of ests is an efficient tool to estimate the identity and abundance of transcripts in a complex mrna sample. this analysis focused on the sulfur-poor 7s globulin phaseolin and lectins, the most abundant seed proteins in commercial cultivars  <cit> , and on the sulfur-rich 11s globulins, 2s albumins, and defensins whose levels are elevated in the absence of phaseolin and phytohemagglutinin  <cit> . to identify contigs coding for sulfur-rich proteins induced in mature seed of smarc1n-pn <dig>  conceptual translations of sequences were compared with de novo sequenced peptides from previously obtained liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  data  <cit> . corresponding cdnas were isolated.

sulfur-poor 7s globulin phaseolin and lectins
within this subset, most ests were derived from the genes encoding the α- and β-subunit of s-type phaseolin, which differ by the presence of a  <dig> base pair insertion, and are present in cultivated varieties representative of the mesoamerican gene pool  <cit>  . the lectin encoded by lec4-b <dig> and phytohemagglutinin encoded by pha-e  <cit>  were the next most highly represented, followed by α-amylase inhibitor- <dig>  <cit>  and α-amylase inhibitor-like protein  <cit> . fewer ests were observed for the leucoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin encoded by pdlec <dig>  <cit> , and an additional phytohemagglutinin previously isolated from an arcelin- <dig> genotype  <cit> . the phytohemagglutinin encoded by pha-l  <cit>  and mannose lectin fril  <cit> , previously identified in sarc <dig> and smarc1n-pn <dig>  <cit> , were not represented in the bat <dig> est dataset. conversely, the arcelin- <dig> phytohemagglutinin was not previously identified in sarc <dig> or smarc1n-pn <dig>  <cit> . there was no evidence for additional phaseolin or lectin transcripts in bat <dig>  the phytohemagglutinins identified here are encoded by distinct genes, as they share only between  <dig> to 87% identity in their deduced amino acid sequence.

sulfur-rich 11s globulins, 2s albumins and defensins
among sulfur-rich proteins, clustering of ests yielded three legumin, three albumin- <dig>  four defensin and eleven albumin- <dig> contigs or singletons. within each protein type, the isoform induced in smarc1n-pn <dig> was encoded by the most highly represented contig in the bat <dig> est collection .

the major legumin cdna encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids . removal of the signal peptide, spanning residues  <dig> to  <dig>  generates a precursor with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kd. cleavage after the conserved asn <dig> residue gives rise to an acidic α-subunit, with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kd and pi of  <dig> , and a β-subunit, with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kd and pi of  <dig> . the α-subunit contains a glu-rich domain, spanning positions  <dig> to  <dig>  conventional n-terminal and de novo peptide sequencing support the location of the cleavage sites  <cit> . de novo sequenced tryptic peptides from replicate samples of 2-d gel spots  <cit>  covered  <dig> and 79% of the deduced sequences of the α- and β-subunits, respectively . the p. vulgaris legumin amino acid sequence shares  <dig> and 41% identity with glycinin a5a4b <dig> from glycine max and arachin  <dig> from arachis hypogaea  <cit> , respectively, but is more similar in length to arachin  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis indicated that the p. vulgaris protein belongs to a group of 11s globulins from legumes, comprising b-type, met-poor legumins from vicia species  <cit>  . the p. vulgaris legumin is part of a subgroup of high molecular weight legumins which includes group- <dig> glycinins from soybean  <cit> , arachin  <dig>  legumin storage proteins  <dig> and - <dig> from lotus japonicus  <cit> , the minor small legumin from pisum sativum  <cit>  and legumin-related high molecular weight polypeptide from vicia faba  <cit> . members of this subgroup are characterized by an extended c-terminal half of the α-subunit arising by expansion and mutation of a sequence repeat.

the albumin- <dig> cdna encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with 80% identity to a seed albumin from vigna radiata and 49% identity to albumin- <dig> from p. sativum  <cit>  . the protein contains four hemopexin-like repeats implicated in polyamine binding  <cit> . de novo sequenced tryptic peptides from replicate samples of 2-d gel spots covered 74% of the deduced sequence of the mature polypeptide   <cit> . the de novo sequencing data indicated that the n-terminal met residue is absent in the mature polypeptide.

the defensin highly expressed in smarc1n-pn <dig> had been previously identified on the basis of its similarity to a defensin from cicer arietinum  <cit> . however, associated tryptic peptide sequences actually belong to antifungal defensin d <dig> from p. vulgaris  <cit> , whose partial cdna and n-terminal amino acid sequences were absent from databases. the defensin d <dig> cdna isolated here encodes a precursor of  <dig> residues with 93% identity to defensin d <dig> from v. radiata  <cit> . the mature peptide is characterized by a cys-stabilized αβ motif, consisting of three β-strands and one α-helix held by four disulfide bridges. the two tryptic peptides previously identified  <cit> , spanning positions  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  are the only ones within range of detection by the mass spectrometer. the second most abundant contig, and associated defensin d <dig> cdna, encode a precursor polypeptide with 93% identity to a defensin from vigna unguiculata. defensins d <dig> and - <dig> are 37% identical in amino acid sequence.

two albumin- <dig> cdnas, albumin-1a and -b may encode the methanol-soluble albumin- <dig> highly expressed in smarc1n-pn <dig>  their deduced amino acid sequences are 97% identical. they encode polypeptide precursors of  <dig> amino acids with 88% identity to a partial albumin- <dig> from p. vulgaris  <cit> , and 71% identity to albumin- <dig> from g. max  <cit>  . the precursors give rise to chains b  and a   <cit> . the b chain is arranged in a knottin-fold containing three β-strands held by three disulfide bridges  <cit> . the peptide previously de novo sequenced spans residues  <dig> to  <dig> of the b chain  <cit> . the presence of an arg at position  <dig> generates a tryptic site unique to albumin-1a and -b, among the albumin- <dig> isoforms represented in the est dataset.

availability of cloned cdnas provides information about the sulfur amino acid content of sulfur-rich proteins whose levels are elevated in smarc1n-pn <dig>  the mature legumin subunits contain  <dig> % of their residues as cys and  <dig> % as met. mature albumin- <dig> contains  <dig> % of cys and  <dig> % of met. mature defensin d <dig> is particularly rich in cys at 17% and lacks met residues. the mature albumin-1a and -b subunits have a cys content of 11%, and a met content of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.

purification of legumin
to further characterize legumin, this protein was purified from smarc1n-pn <dig> by targeting the most abundant 2-d gel spots,  <dig> to  <dig> , corresponding to its α-subunit and representing 10% of total protein  <cit> . the apparent pi value was used to select conditions for purification by ion exchange chromatography. fractions were screened by sds-page for bands having the appropriate molecular weight. ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography yielded two fractions of interest, characterized by size exclusion chromatography. proteins were identified after in-gel trypsin digestion and lc-ms. the first fraction contained group  <dig> late embryogenesis abundant protein with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig>  kd . in 2-d gels, this protein migrated to spots  <dig>  and  <dig> , having apparent molecular weight and pi values close to those of the legumin α-subunit. the native molecular weight of group  <dig> late embryogenesis abundant protein was measured as  <dig> ±  <dig> kd , suggesting a multimer of nine identical subunits. the second fraction contained the legumin polypeptide precursor, α- and β-subunits, with apparent molecular weights of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd respectively . two minor bands, of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd were also identified as the α-subunit . detection of the mass of a tryptic peptide, 423-nrgsngieetlctlk- <dig>  containing an intact cleavage site was characteristic of the precursor. a complex pattern of elution was observed after size exclusion chromatography . a first peak contained all three major polypeptides, with a molecular weight of  <dig> ±  <dig> kd, suggesting possible associations between trimers of the precursor and hexamers of α- and β-subunit. a second peak contained the α-subunit alone, with a molecular weight of  <dig> ±  <dig> kd, suggesting a hexamer. recovery of the α-subunit alone may be related to the inclusion of reducing agent during purification.

discussion
profiling of free amino acids in bat <dig> seeds enabled a rational selection of developmental stages to generate ests, which correspond to distinct phases of γ-glu-s-methyl-cys accumulation. analysis of general go categories related to primary metabolism, photosynthesis, response to water deficit and nutrient reservoir activity validated the representativeness of ests at the different stages. free amino acid and go category profiles confirm and extend the findings of fait et al.  <cit>  on the metabolic transitions to storage product accumulation and desiccation in arabidopsis seeds. they highlighted a decrease in the levels of free amino acids, particularly asn, gln and lys, during reserve accumulation, indicative of metabolic transformations and efficient incorporation into storage proteins. nitrogen-rich amino acids, asn, lys and arg, were transiently elevated during the transition to seed desiccation, suggesting their role as a nitrogen source to support germination prior to the mobilization of storage protein. the same was true of aromatic amino acids, trp, phe and tyr, which may support the biosynthesis of shikimate-derived compounds for defense and indole-acetic acid during germination. steady-state transcript levels of most enzymes of primary metabolism examined had reduced levels during the active phase of reserve accumulation.

the biphasic accumulation of γ-glu-s-methyl-cys is consistent with a function of s-methyl-cys as a storage form of excess sulfur. during the lag phase, incorporation of sulfur amino acids into storage proteins may efficiently compete with the biosynthesis of s-methyl-cys. based on the high levels of free s-methyl-cys detected at stages iii and iv, substantial flux through this metabolite may lead to accumulation in the γ-glutamyl dipeptide form. the rise in arg levels between stages iii to v suggests a transient accumulation of nitrogen into this nitrogen-rich amino acid in anticipation of active storage protein accumulation. this increase may be mediated by arginosuccinate lyase activity, whose transcript is overrepresented during stage iv.

analysis of go categories related to sulfur metabolism revealed the occurrence of complete pathways of sulfate assimilation, de novo cys and met biosynthesis. similar findings have been reported for soybean seed  <cit> . these data may be interpreted in relation with current understanding of the sulfur nutrition of legume seed. the main sources of sulfur transported to the seed are expected to be s-methylmethionine  <cit>  and homoglutathione  <cit> . in soybean, most sulfate appears to be converted to homoglutathione in the pod, prior to uptake by developing cotyledons, although some is detected in developing seed  <cit> . however, under sulfur-limiting conditions, glutathione exclusively, and no sulfate, is translocated to the seed, according to a model developed in wheat  <cit> . interestingly, arabidopsis knock-out mutants of sulfate transporters that have been characterized so far show increased sulfate content in mature seed, suggesting a function in intracellular transport rather than uptake by the embryo  <cit> . beside the generation of sulfide for de novo cys biosynthesis, the sulfate assimilatory pathway is required for the biosynthesis of the activated nucleotide 3'-phospho-5'-adenosinephosphosulfate, the universal donor in sulfate transfer reactions. adenylyl-sulfate kinase activity, forming 3'-phospho-5'-adenosinephosphosulfate, which competes with adenylyl-sulfate reductase for its substrate, was represented in the est dataset . cystathionine γ-synthase and -β-lyase likely provide homocysteine as an acceptor for methyl transfer from s-methylmethionine, catalyzed by homocysteine s-methyltransferase  <cit> , while met synthase is essential to recycle homocysteine produced in the s-adenosylmethionine cycle, which appeared highly active according to the high representation of the met adenosyltransferase activity category. further research is required to fully understand the significance of the sulfate assimilatory pathway, and the relative contributions of de novo cys and met biosynthesis in seed metabolism.

previous results have shown that the absence of cys-poor phaseolin and phytohemagglutinin in smarc1n-pn <dig> leads to a shift of sulfur from s-methyl-cys to the protein cys pool  <cit> . by integrating proteomic and est data, the deduced sequences of several proteins contributing to the increased levels of sulfur amino acids in smarc1n-pn <dig> were identified. these proteins have a higher cys than met content, providing an explanation for the preferential increase in cys over met in the mutant line.

legumin is found at relatively low levels of ca. 3% of seed protein in common bean cultivars, as compared with other grain legumes  <cit> . identification of its deduced amino acid sequence establishes that it is a member of the high molecular weight 11s globulins. the mechanism leading to the evolution of high molecular weight 11s globulins involves expansion of a repeat sequence at the c-terminal end of the α-subunit. the sequences of these repeats differ between p. vulgaris legumin, arachin  <dig> and glycinin a5a4b <dig> . legumin has four instances of the sequence nh2-hkeeekeveplp-cooh, compared with four of the sequence nh2-gydddrrp-cooh and eight of the sequence nh2-dddrr-cooh in arachin  <dig>  glycinin a5a4b <dig> has three repeats of the sequence nh2-qdedededed-cooh, compared with two in glycinin a4b <dig>  <cit> . the first instance of this sequence, spanning positions  <dig> to  <dig> of legumin, is relatively well conserved but not repeated in legumin and arachin  <dig>  these observations suggest that expansion of repeats probably occurred, at least in part, after the separation of the lineages leading to the three species.

purification of legumin revealed substantial accumulation of the propolypeptide in smarc1n-pn <dig>  a similar finding has been reported in transgenic soybean where the expression of the α-and α'-subunits of the 7s globulin α-conglycinin was suppressed  <cit> . interestingly, the proglycinin was shown to be trafficked directly from the er to the vacuole, whereas mature 11s globulins transit in the golgi apparatus. in most legume crops, α-subunits of 11s globulins have an apparent molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kd. by contrast, p. vulgaris and v. unguiculata  <cit>  share a single, dominant high molecular weight legumin whose α-subunit has an apparent molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kd. similarly, in l. japonicus, two of three major legumins, the legumin storage proteins  <dig> and - <dig>  which are closely related to the p. vulgaris legumin, have α-subunit apparent molecular weights of  <dig> and  <dig> kd, respectively  <cit> . in g. max, an additional cleavage site in proglycinin gives rise to a <dig> and a <dig> subunits, having a reduced molecular weight  <cit> . the significance of the  <dig> kd difference between the predicted and apparent molecular weight of the major legumin α-subunit, and the detection of minor α-subunit polypeptides of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd is unclear. the minor polypeptides may represent partial degradation products, and the discrepancy in molecular weight may be due to an effect of the glu-rich domain on electrophoretic behavior. alternatively, these differences may arise by a possible post-translational modification of the mature α-subunit. the absence of this modification in prolegumin, whose predicted and apparent molecular weight is similar, would reflect differences in trafficking, as already noted in soybean. among high molecular weight legumins in other legume crops, the α-subunit of p. sativum minor small legumin accumulates only as degradation products ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kd, which was interpreted as an outcome of early mobilization  <cit> , while only the β-subunit of arachin  <dig> was identified in the mature seed proteome of a. hypogaea  <cit> .

although phaseolin and lectins have been characterized in great detail, the number and identity of genes encoding these proteins is still unknown. in the present study, there was evidence for only two phaseolin genes in the bat <dig> est dataset. beside the apa locus on linkage group b <dig>  two lectin loci have been mapped on linkage group b <dig>  <cit> . est, proteomic  <cit> , cdna  <cit>  and genomic sequence data  <cit>  can be integrated to provide information on the composition of the apa locus in different p. vulgaris genotypes. in bat <dig> and arc <dig> genotypes, a gene order consisting in lec4-b17/pha-e/phytohemagglutinin/α-amylase inhibitor-like protein can be inferred. in arc <dig>  arc <dig> and arc <dig> genotypes, the arcelin- <dig> phytohemagglutinin appears to be substituted with pha-l. pdlec <dig> encoding leucoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin, isolated from a phytohemagglutinin-deficient pinto cultivar  <cit> , whose expression is elevated in smarc1n-pn <dig>  may be one of the lectin genes located outside of the apa locus.

CONCLUSIONS
the bat <dig> est collection provides a foundation to initiate further studies of sulfur amino acid metabolism in developing seed, as all relevant pathways and enzyme activities are represented. the results presented here are consistent with a mechanism whereby sulfur can be efficiently partitioned between s-methyl-cys and cys, but its metabolic basis is not understood. the identification and characterization of sulfur-rich proteins whose levels are increased in the absence of phaseolin and major lectins provides an explanation for the preferential increase in cys over met.
