BACKGROUND
dna microarrays offer a powerful and effective technology to monitor the alterations of gene expression for thousands of genes simultaneously. this technology has been widely applied to the exploration of quantitative changes in gene expression in a variety of areas including diseases and toxicological studies  <cit> . one of the key tasks of microarray analysis is to investigate the expression patterns from the different experiment designs so that differentially expressed  genes can be identified  <cit> .

in this paper, we consider the analysis of a two-color cdna microarray experiment. briefly, mrna contained in each of two cell populations is extracted, reverse-transcribed into cdna, and labelled with either cy <dig>  or cy <dig>  dyes. cy <dig> and cy <dig> preparations are combined and deposited on the microarray, where labelled molecules hybridize to the spots containing their complementary sequence. the amount of hybridization to each spot is quantified by scanning the array with a laser beam and observed the intensities of light emitted  <cit> . a pair of measurements, separately for the two dyes, are observed as xgi and ygi  for gene g on array i, where n is the number of genes represented on the microarray and n is the number of replicated arrays.

given the microarray expression data, a common task is to determine which genes are differentially expressed under the two conditions. there has been a considerable amount of work in this area  <cit> . the simplest way to ascertain a gene's differential expression is based on a fold change criteria, defined by the log-ratio ). the straightforward fold-change method widely used by biologists takes into account only the genes whose fold changes are more than 2-fold as differentially expressed genes. the 2-fold rule is too simple to deal with the issues raised by the complicated error in dna microarray data analysis  <cit> .

traditional statistical methods may not produce reliable results when they are used directly to determine differentially expressed genes. firstly, it is common to have thousands of genes on one chip with relatively few replications in microarray experiments. thus, the variance estimates of gene expression data are often unreliable with the small sample size. the common approach using t- or f-statistic is not applicable since it strongly depends on the sample size and normality of the expression data  <cit> . it is known that microarray data may not follow a normal distribution or even be symmetrical and the sample size is generally small  <cit> . modified t-statistic is suggested by adding a small constant to the gene-specific variance estimate  <cit> . the method makes the gene-specific variance estimates shrink towards a common variance. recently, the hierarchical bayesian models are employed to variance regulation by estimating moderate variances of individual genes  <cit> . the adjusted variances are calculated with the weighted averages of the gene-specific sample variances and pooled variances across all genes. with the additional combination of variances, the performance of these methods is improved significantly in identifying the significance of gene expression.

another common feature of microarray data is the distinctive error structure with gene variances changing with the expression levels in a nonlinear fashion  <cit> . their relations are shown with our experimental data in figure  <dig>  some traditional methods are statistically inefficient because of the significant violation from the general assumptions. however, the bayesian philosophy appears to be suitable for this type of problems  <cit> . instead of the directly modelling the fluctuation of microarray data, bayesian models are characterized by mixing measurements over a latent gene-specific component. a hierarchical gamma-gamma  model is developed in  <cit>  for detecting changes of gene expression in a two-channel cdna microarray experiment. the model is extended to replicated chips with multiple conditions using a hierarchical lognormal-normal  model  <cit> . both of them are based on the assumption of a constant coefficient of variation  across genes. according to extensive exploratory data analysis, however, we observe that there are specific correlations between the pair of measurements within each gene spot across samples. the correlation pattern is presented in figure  <dig> 

motivated by these error relations, we propose a novel multivariate bayesian framework for microarray analysis. the multivariate bayesian model, compatible with the dependence between mean and variance in the univariate bayesian model, can relax the constant assumption between measurements by adding a covariance structure. due to the computational complexity within the bayesian framework, we apply the modified generalized likelihood ratio test  proposed by benjamini and hochberg  <cit>  to detect gene expression patterns. when the bayesian model is in accordance with the microarray data, the power of true identification of differentially expressed genes can be improved substantially.

in this paper, we describe the multivariate bayesian hierarchical model for gene expression data analysis, and present the generalized likelihood ratio test  procedures with the p-value adjustment to identify differentially expressed genes. the sample size of microarray data play an important role in replicated microarray experiments. so in our simulation study, we first explore the effect of the number of replications in our methodology and suggest that the number of replicated chips is not less than  <dig>  we also compare our methods with existing ones, such as fold change, modified t-test and lnn model. the new methodology shows good performance based on operating characteristics. in the analysis of the real microarray data, our method is proven to be powerful to identify more significant genes.

RESULTS
multivariate hierarchal bayesian model and inference
based on the lnn hierarchical model  <cit> , we develop a multivariate model to relax the constant cv assumption between measurements by adding covariance. the model is also compatible with the complicated structure of variance in microarray data. the model is first described in this section, and then the glrt is employed to infer the expression pattern.

first, we consider the typical two-color microarray data xgi and ygi  for gene g on array i, where n is the number of genes represented on the microarray and n is the number of replicated arrays. we denote the n replicated pairs of expression levels of gene g as zg = ', where zgi = '. firstly, zgi is assumed to follow approximately a multivariate gaussian distribution n <dig> with a latent gene-specific expression component π. thus, the likelihood of gene g is written as

 f=∏i=1np=−n|∑g|−n2exp⁡{−12∑i'∑g−1} 

the bayesian formulation requires a prior distribution π. for a normal distribution, several kinds of priors for the mean and variance variables have been studied in the literature, including the vague prior and natural conjugate prior  <cit> . for microarray data, the conjugate prior is a suitable choice  <cit> . indeed, not only their posterior has the same functional form as the prior, but the conjugate prior also incorporates the inherent dependence between the mean and the variance  <cit> . the multivariate conjugate prior distribution π of equation  is composed of the probability distributions of μg | Σg following a multivariate normality and Σg following an inverse wishart distribution  as

 μg|∑g~n2∑g~iw 

in which α = {λ <dig>  ν <dig>  Λ0} contains the global hyperparameters and Θ={μg0:g= <dig> ⋯,n} the gene-specific parameters. given the parameters, the conjugate prior π=π is the following product

 π=n2iw 

by the bayes rule, the corresponding posterior distribution also has the same functional form as the prior

 π=n2iw 

where

 μgn=λ0λ0+nμg0+nλ0+nmgλn=λ0+nνn=ν0+nΛn=Λ0+∑i=1n'+λ0nλ0+n' 

and mg=∑i=1nzgi/n=', the estimation of mean expression of gene g over n replications. obviously, the posterior combines the information from the prior and the data in a sensible way.

since α and Θ are generally unknown, we estimate them with maximum likelihood estimation . the likelihood functions of gene g and over all genes are respectively written as

 lg=∏g=1nϕ=Φ 

and

 l=∏g=1nlg=∏g=1nΦ 

the gene-specific parameters μg <dig> are only related to lg. their optimal values might be obtained by solving the equation

 ∂Φ/∂μg0= <dig> 

therefore, equation  can be rewritten by the bayes rule as

 π 

with equations , , and , equation  can be explicitly expressed as

 Φ=−nλ0|Λ0|ν0/2ΓΓλn|Λn|νn/2ΓΓ 

finally, the following solutions are calculated as the estimates of μg0

 μ^g0=mg=',g= <dig> ⋯,n 

given these estimates μ^g <dig>  the global parameters α^ can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood function in equation .

based on the proposed multivariate hierarchical model, the glrt, which is a generalization of the neyman-pearson test, can be used for the identification. in fact, the identification between two cell populations is equivalent to testing the following hypothesis,

 h0:μg10=μg20v.s.h1:μg10≠μg <dig> 

thus, the corresponding glrt statistic for our hypothesis can be defined as follows:

 κg=2ln⁡max⁡μg10=μg20lg) 

obviously, the denominator of equation  is the maximization subject to μg10=μg20=ug <dig> while the optimization in the numerator is unconstrained. in fact, the theoretical optimal estimates of μg <dig> without constraint are determined in equation . also the estimates with the constraint can be found by solving

 {∂Φ/∂μg0=0s.t.μg10=μg <dig> 

and the solutions are

 u^g0=mg1+mg2+g= <dig> ⋯,n 

it is proven that κg approximately follows the χ <dig> distribution with one degree of freedom on the null hypothesis  <cit> . if κg is larger than some critical value κ of χ <dig>  we would not reject the alternative h <dig>  that is to say, gene g would be identified as de gene, otherwise as an equivalently expressed  gene. however, it is essential to control some erroneous rejections and acceptances in testing situation. in the context of microarray, the false discovery rate  has emerged as a practical object to be controlled in multiple testing  <cit> . the fdr is defined as the expectation of type i errors among the rejected null hypothesis, that is, the average of the ratios of the number of false positives to the number of de genes identified. the scheme of benjamini and hochberg  is applied to adjust p-value in the testing of microarray data  <cit>  .

simulation studies
the purpose of our simulation study is to determine the effect of sample size in our model and compare the proposed method with classical statistics for microarray data analysis. we simulate the expression data with n =  <dig> genes and n =  <dig> replications generated using our model. different expression patterns are simulated by adjusting the element values of μg <dig>  for example, ee genes are generated with the same value μg10=μg20; de genes are obtained with different values uniformly sampled from different intervals to make μg10≠μg <dig>  the probability of differential expression is set to p =  <dig>  for the binomial distribution to select the de genes.

microarray data are typically "large n and small n", that is, the number of samples is much smaller than the number of genes. especially with the emergence of replicated microarray, the number of replication is always discussed in microarray analysis  <cit> . multiple testing is always employed in microarray analysis  <cit> . however, multiple testing is generally distorted by the dimension curse, which makes parameter estimates biased with a smaller number of sample sizes. on the other hand, a larger number of genes appear to compensate partially for the destabilizing effect of the sample size, especially for the estimation of the common parameters of all genes. so we should explore the effect of the sample size in our methods. we simulate the replicated measurements with the previous steps, only changing the number of replication from n =  <dig> to  <dig>  then we estimate the corresponding parameters of our hierarchical model and calculate the statistic κg  respectively for the  <dig> data sets.

knowing the underlying expression of each gene, we compute several corresponding statistics of error rates, including as sensitivity, specificity, positive predict value  and negative predict value , which are defined in the subsection "multiple testing" of the section "methods", for data sets of different sample sizes. the results are plotted in figure  <dig>  where the x-axis represents the number of replications and the y-axis represents different error rates. obviously, the sample size shows little effect on npv and specificity but significant effect on ppv and sensitivity. all of them almost increase and approximate to stability when the sample sizes increase, so the performance of the method becomes better and better. it is discovered that the ppv of our testing is significantly increased when the sample size n =  <dig>  so in part it is reasonable to select n =  <dig>  as suggested in literature  <cit> .

in the simulation studies, we also compare our methodology with existing methods for microarray data analysis, such as the fold-change, t-test and lnn model. the fold-change method makes use of direct comparison of intensities, in which the error structure is ignored. the two-sample t-test overcomes the limitation by assuming the normality of expression data, but it is affected by the normality assumption and sample size. the lnn bayesian model is developed to address these shortcomings. we improve the lnn model using the multivariate bayesian model by considering the correlation between two measurements of each spot. glrt is applied to test the hypotheses within the multivariate bayesian framework.

flexibility in modelling the correlation between the measurements is a key advantage of the proposed method. thus, the expression data can be simulated with different correlation coefficients. in fact, figure  <dig> shows the simulated data for ρ =  <dig> . in order to evaluate the performance, we also simulate two data sets with  <dig>  and  <dig> . knowing the true expression patterns of each gene, we can calculate the error rates of inference such as sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv and fdr that are defined in the section "multiple testing". the results are also shown in table  <dig>  in comparison with the good performance of glrt, t-test is poor in sensitivity, ppv and fdr. with the increase of the correlation coefficient ρ, the rates of true identification of de in t-test fall from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the lnn model. on the contrary, the rate in our model is increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . that implies that the lnn model and the t-test do not perform well for highly dependent observations. as to the fold-change method, both sensitivity and fdr are very low and their ranges are  and  respectively. in fact, the number of de genes identified with fold-change is reasonably small in comparison with the large number of genes being tested. the results show that the fold-change method can be too conservative, that the performance of t-test can be misleading, and that the identification capability of the lnn model is limited especially when the assumption is deviated.

results from microarray experiments
any artificial scenario inevitably is biased regarding the underlying model and only reflects certain aspects of biological reality. therefore, the proposed method is tested in on two real datasets to verify its performance in real world applications. the first dataset contains the gene expression profiles of adenocarcinoma and normal tissues  <cit> . the data was gathered on the following website . in the microarray experiment, n =  <dig> pairs of colon adenocarcinoma and normal colon samples were studied and n =  <dig> cdnas and ests are represented on the oligonucleotide array. we apply our method to the microarray data to identify the differentially expressed genes in colon adenocarcinoma. the parameters α and Θ are estimated, and the estimate of correlation coefficient is ρ^ =  <dig> . the glrt κgs of equation  are calculated for the inference controlling fdr α =  <dig>  and  <dig> de genes are identified using our multivariate bayesian formulation. however, in  <cit>   <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes in adenocarcinoma are listed whose ratios are more than 4-fold and p-values associated was also marginally greater than  <dig> . comparatively, we have discovered that all 47+ <dig> =  <dig> genes in  <cit>  are detected with high confidence using our method. furthermore, our gene list also contains many gene products that are related to  <dig> genes in  <cit> , such as ckshs <dig>  mgsa, matrilysin, and diverse products related to proliferation and metabolic rate. some genes related to guanylin and colon mucosa antigen are also identified as significant genes with our model. therefore, our results include not only the genes that are already known to be expressed abnormally in colon cancer, but also other genes confirmed by biological experiments  <cit> .

the proposed method is also illustrated with another example of microarray data analysis where the objective is to identify differentially expressed genes in mouse liver after treatment with a toxic metal . in our microarray experiment, n =  <dig> hybridizations are repeated for n =  <dig> genes and we obtained  <dig> pairs of red and green intensity for each gene, zgi=' . data normalization is essential and we still denote the normalized data with zgi  <cit> . as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the error structure of our microarray data depends on the means and correlations between the intensities measured from different dyes. hence we apply the multivariate bayesian framework to our microarray data. the parameters α and Θ are estimated, in which the estimate of correlation coefficient is ρ^ =  <dig> . then the glrt κgs of equation  are calculated for inference and the bh-method is performed to adjust the p-values controlling the fdr α =  <dig>  in multiple testing. the critical value is calculated to be  <dig> , which means the genes in the following set are inferred as de genes

 j = {g : λg ≥ κ =  <dig> }, 

using this criterion,  <dig> genes are identified. the two-sample t-test detects  <dig> specific genes controlling the fdr =  <dig>  while the fold-change only detects  <dig> genes. in fact, the above mentioned  <dig> genes from the fold-change and  <dig> from the t-test are all included in j. furthermore, the fold-change does not provide the estimation of the fdr. we have applied another commonly used approach, called the significance analysis of microarray   <cit> . when we adjust the parameters especially Δ to detect  <dig> genes in which 82% belongs to j, it gives a higher fdr about  <dig> % than ours. comparatively, our method provides a more powerful tool for identification of de genes while keeping a lower fdr.

although the dna microarray technology is very effective for understanding alterations in genome-wide patterns of gene expression, there may be situations in which we need more evidence to determine which genes are truly differentially expressed from the statistical results and further biological analysis may be required to verify the candidate genes. in our study, we also perform another biological test, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  to confirm the de genes. we have found that the relative expression of ctsc , dnase <dig> , mt- <dig>  and a2m  after the normalization are up-regulated in triplicate analysis. based on gene ontology  analysis  <cit> , they are highly related to the transcriptional regulatory of prostease inhibitor activity  and detoxification of copper ion . this implies that there is a good correlation between the microarray experiment, rt-pcr, as well as the bayesian method we have proposed.

discussion
the dna microarray technology has important applications in gene expression data analysis. however, the potential sources of random and systematic measurement errors are a critical issue in statistical analysis. it is impossible to propose a statistical model that reflects all sources of errors. therefore, a good model should capture the most essential features of the data. currently, the bayesian methods provide a practical and effective tool for microarray analysis. we have explored the multivariate bayesian framework to identify de genes in replicated microarray experiments. more inherent characteristics of expression data are accommodated in the proposed model that is flexible and adaptable to the measurements of each spot. de genes can be inferred by the glrt adjusted by bh-method controlling the fdr. in comparison with other methods, the operational characteristics of our method are better than the intuitive fold change, the t-test and the lnn model. furthermore, our method produces lower fdr and higher efficiency of identification.

moreover, our model can be extended to the microarray experiments under multiple conditions beyond control and treatment. for example, one may be interested in gene expression of k different dosages of some medicine with replicated microarray experiments. that is to say, k measurements are observed from one gene spot. if there are n genes on one chip and n hybridizations are repeated, the measurements from one gene spot are written as zgi=' . the corresponding bayesian model, similar to equations  and  can also be applied to model the expression data, and only the dimensionality of the feature vectors is k instead of  <dig>  besides the global parameter α, the gene-specific parameters are denoted as

 μg0=' 

and

 Λ0= 

as to the inference, the number of hypotheses would increase significantly with the number of conditions. for example, there are  <dig> hypotheses to infer under  <dig> conditions, equivalent expression, altered expression in one condition and distinct expression in each condition. thus, only some patterns of interest should be tested with the glrt calculated on the specific constraints.

with the widespread applications to microarray data analysis, more sophisticated bayesian methods are needed to solve more statistical problems, such as normal assumption, gene independence and parameter estimation. normality and independence are regarded as the devices deducing the probability distribution function, but we believe more improvement can be made, especially in terms of dependence.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a multivariate bayesian model for differential gene expression data analysis. in addition to the gene-specific variance, this model takes into account the covariance between the pair of measurements to relax the constant assumption of correlation coefficient in the common used hierarchical models. our model provides a more realistic and flexible estimate for the variance of gene expression data under limited replicates. based on the multivariate hierarchical model, the multiple glrt takes into account the power of gene-specific variance, latent gene variance and covariance. in our examples above, the results obtained from our model show better operating characteristics, especially when the correlation coefficient of gene expression within one spot is significant. this indicates that the power of identification of differentially expressed genes can be improved if the bayesian model is developed in accordance with the statistical properties of microarray data.
