BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori causes various human gastric diseases. in  <dig> to 20% of infected individuals, h. pylori-induced chronic gastric inflammation progresses to gastroduodenal ulcers, gastric cancer or gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma  <cit> . bacterial, environmental and host genetic factors may affect the progress and outcome of gastric disease in these individuals. virulence of individual h. pylori strains is one such factor responsible for severe disease, and several virulence factors have been described such as the presence of a cag pathogenicity island  and vacuolating cytotoxin   <cit> . the presence of cag pai genes correlates strongly with the development of ulcer diseases and gastric cancer  <cit> .

nuclear factor-κb  is a crucial regulator of many cellular processes, including immune response, inflammation and apoptosis  <cit> . it has been established that inflammation plays an important role in cancer development  <cit> . the five known mammalian rel genes encode seven rel-related proteins: rela/p65; p <dig> and its processing product, p50; p <dig> and its processing product, p52; c-rel; and relb. each contains an n-terminal rel homology domain that mediates dna binding, dimerization and interaction with the iκb family of nf-κb inhibitors. p <dig>  c-rel and relb contain c-terminal transactivation domains, but p <dig> and p <dig> do not. the prototypical nf-κb complex is a p50–p <dig> heterodimer. in resting cells, nf-κb is complexed to cytoplasmic nf-κb inhibitors. iκbα is the best characterized of these inhibitors. nf-κb activation requires phosphorylation of two conserved serine residues within the n-terminal domain of iκbα   <cit> . phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination and 26s proteasome-mediated degradation of iκbα, thereby releasing nf-κb from the complex where it translocates to the nucleus and activates various genes. stimulation such as cytokines results in the activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways with subsequent activation of the iκb kinase  complex. this complex comprises two catalytic subunits  and the regulatory subunit , and can phosphorylate iκbα  <cit> . only h. pylori strains containing the cag pai  can direct signaling in gastric epithelial cells to activate the ikk complex and thus nf-κb, leading to the release of chemoattractants such as interleukin - <dig>  <cit> . however, the exact mechanism by which cag pai+ h. pylori strains induce activation of nf-κb in gastric epithelial cells is not clear yet. the cag pai encodes a bacterial type iv secretion capable of translocating effector molecules  <cit> . based on the observations that mutants of caga, the only type iv secretion system effector protein, often induce a considerable amount of il- <dig>  early studies reported that caga did not activate nf-κb or il- <dig> secretion in infected cells  <cit> . however, caga was recently reported to induce il- <dig> release through nf-κb activation in time- and strain-dependent manners  <cit> .

protein kinases are also required for optimal nf-κb activation by targeting functional domains of nf-κb protein itself. phosphorylation of the p <dig> subunit plays a key role in determining both the strength and duration of the nf-κb-mediated transcriptional response  <cit> . sites of phosphorylation reported to date are serines  <dig> and  <dig>  in the rel-homology domain, and serines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  three phosphoacceptor sites located in the transactivation domain. importantly, phosphorylation at serine  <dig> reduced the ability of p <dig> to bind iκbα  <cit>  and facilitated the recruitment of tafii <dig>  a component of the basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> . phosphorylation at serine  <dig> is also responsible for recruiting coactivators such as p <dig>  <cit> . the above data emphasize the importance of p <dig> phosphorylation at serine  <dig> in the function of nf-κb. in contrast, p <dig> phosphorylation does not regulate nf-κb activation, because p <dig> lacks a transactivation domain. akt is a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  that has been implicated in phosphorylation of serine  <dig> on the p <dig> subunit  <cit> . akt activation also mediates multiple biological activities including increased survival, proliferation and growth of tumor cells. the present study investigated whether akt regulates nf-κb activation in response to h. pylori infection.

RESULTS
immunohistochemical studies
h. pylori-positive gastritis biopsies of  <dig> patients were immunostained for phosphorylated akt. staining was limited to mucosal epithelial cells in all  <dig> patients , whereas no such staining was observed in the normal mucosa of all three healthy volunteers . epithelial cells from three patients showed strong staining, while those of six patients showed moderate staining, and the remainder demonstrated weak staining.

cag pai is required for h. pylori-mediated il- <dig> induction in gastric epithelial cells
the cag pai is a 40-kbp cluster of approximately  <dig> genes and encodes a type iv secretary apparatus which injects the caga protein, and possibly other unknown proteins, into eukaryotic cells  <cit> . vird <dig> is one of seven genes in cag pai that are virulent  gene homologues  <cit> . in h. pylori, vird <dig> is thought to act as an adapter protein for the transfer of caga protein and possibly other yet unknown proteins into the transfer channel formed by other vir proteins in cag pai  <cit> . the vird <dig> mutant cannot translocate caga  <cit> . il- <dig> cytokine is chemotactic for neutrophils and lymphocytes, and is induced in response to h. pylori infection. many of the cis-elements that regulate il- <dig> expression have been identified, including binding sites for nf-κb  <cit> . h. pylori-induced il- <dig> expression is nf-κb dependent  <cit> . to examine the role of virulence factors in h. pylori-mediated nf-κb activation, we compared il- <dig> induction in gastric epithelial cells infected with Δcag pai, Δvaca, Δvird <dig> or wild-type h. pylori strain. infection with wild-type strain  <dig> induced il- <dig> mrna expression in mkn <dig> cells, while the isogenic mutant that lacked cag pai expression did not induce il- <dig> mrna expression . wild-type h. pylori strain but not Δcag pai strain induced il- <dig> mrna expression in ags cells . in contrast, vaca and vird <dig> null mutants induced il- <dig> mrna expression similar to the parental strain . our study on isogenic mutants derived from the  <dig> strain suggests that h. pylori cag pai plays an important role in the induction of il- <dig> mrna expression.

h. pylori activates akt and induces phosphorylation of the nf-κb p <dig> subunit in gastric epithelial cells
we next examined whether coculture of gastric epithelial mkn <dig> cells with h. pylori results in activation of akt, using western blot analysis. as shown in figure 3a , phosphorylated akt levels increased after only  <dig> min of coculture and this phosphorylation persisted for  <dig> h. there was no significant change in total akt protein level in h. pylori-infected mkn <dig> cells . in vitro akt kinase activity also increased  <dig> min after the addition of h. pylori to mkn <dig> cells . since akt is an upstream kinase implicated in p <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> , we then assessed p <dig> phosphorylation with an antibody specific for p <dig> phosphorylated on serine  <dig>  p <dig> phosphorylation was induced after  <dig> h of stimulation with h. pylori . h. pylori infection also induced phosphorylated iκbα . kinetic analysis of h. pylori-induced degradation and resynthesis of iκbα in mkn <dig> cells revealed gradual increase in iκbα levels . these results indicate that h. pylori-induced phosphorylation of iκbα leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of iκbα, thereby releasing nf-κb from the complex followed by its translocation to the nucleus to activate genes. this signal is terminated through cytoplasmic resequestration of nf-κb, which depends on iκbα synthesis, a process requiring nf-κb transcriptional activity  <cit> . similar results were obtained in ags cells .

we next examined whether the observed akt activation was specific to the cag pai domain, based on the above results indicating the importance of cag pai expression for il- <dig> induction in gastric epithelial cells in vitro . we used a wild-type h. pylori strain  and an isogenic cag pai mutant . stimulation with the wild-type strain induced akt phosphorylation in mkn <dig> and ags cells, while the isogenic mutant that lacked the expression of cag pai did not . these results suggest the important role of h. pylori cag pai in the phosphorylation of akt.

h. pylori-induced p <dig> phosphorylation is pi3k-dependent
akt is a substrate for pi3k, and thus we investigated the role of this kinase in h. pylori-induced akt activation and p <dig> phosphorylation. as expected, inhibition of pi3k with ly <dig> inhibited h. pylori-induced akt activation , but interestingly, also abrogated h. pylori-induced p <dig> phosphorylation . despite being mutually dependent, the nuclear translocation, dna binding and transcriptional activity of nf-κb may rely on independent regulatory elements. we investigated the role of pi3k in each of these processes by using the ly <dig> inhibitor. mkn <dig> cells were infected with h. pylori and nf-κb dna binding was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . as shown in figure 4b, a complex was induced in these cells within  <dig> min after infection with h. pylori. this binding activity was reduced by the addition of either cold probe or a typical nf-κb sequence derived from the ccl <dig> gene but not by an oligonucleotide containing the ap- <dig> binding site . furthermore, an nf-κb dna complex composed of p <dig> and p <dig> was induced in mkn <dig> cells within  <dig> min after infection with h. pylori, but pretreatment of mkn <dig> cells with ly <dig> did not inhibit h. pylori-mediated nf-κb dna binding activity .

h. pylori-stimulated nf-κb transcriptional activity is dependent on pi3k/akt
next, to assess whether h. pylori-induced pi3k activity affected nf-κb transcriptional activity, we transfected mkn <dig> cells with an nf-κb reporter construct . in contrast to the effect of ly <dig> on the dna-binding activity of nf-κb, ly <dig> pretreatment caused 65% decline in h. pylori-stimulated luciferase expression from κb-luc . overexpression of the dominant-negative akt mutant also suppressed the ability of h. pylori to stimulate κb-luc in a dose-dependent manner . the above findings indicate that the transcriptional activity but not the dna binding activity of nf-κb is sensitive to inhibition of akt and pi3k.

pi3k inhibition or transfection with small interference rnas for p <dig> and akt suppresses h. pylori-induced il- <dig> expression
finally, we investigated the effect of inhibition of h. pylori-induced pi3k activity on il- <dig> expression. pretreatment of mkn <dig> cells with ly <dig> reduced h. pylori-stimulated il- <dig> mrna expression as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  . inhibition of pi3k also significantly decreased the amount of il- <dig> secreted by mkn <dig> cells stimulated with h. pylori in a dose-dependent manner .

ly <dig> is a chemical inhibitor, and thus its target specificity may be questionable. thus, small interference rnas  for p <dig> and akt were used to examine the role of p <dig> and akt activation in the signal transduction pathway leading to il- <dig> expression by h. pylori infection. each sirna specifically inhibited the expression of p <dig> and akt . figure  <dig> also shows that h. pylori-induced il- <dig> mrna expression was inhibited by sirnas for p <dig> and akt, confirming that p <dig> and akt are important in h. pylori-induced il- <dig> expression.

discussion
nf-κb activation is known to regulate various cellular responses, including apoptosis, and is required for the induction of inflammatory and tissue-repair genes  <cit> . as reported previously  <cit> , we demonstrated that h. pylori modulates the nf-κb system in gastric epithelial cells by inducing iκbα phosphorylation and degradation, nf-κb dna binding activity, and nf-κb transcriptional activity. although this investigation was a preliminary in nature in a small number of patients, we also showed that h. pylori infection activated akt in epithelial cells, both in vivo and in vitro, and that this is dependent on an intact cag pai in vitro. interestingly, h. pylori also stimulated endogenous p <dig> phosphorylation on serine  <dig>  phosphorylation of p <dig> at serine  <dig> in the transactivation domain enhances the transcriptional activity of nf-κb  <cit> . although previous studies using pathogenic strains containing the cag pai showed nf-κb activation and cytokine expression in gastric epithelial cells  <cit> , ours is the first demonstration that cag pai+ h. pylori strains induce gene expression through p <dig> phosphorylation, and that h. pylori-induced p <dig> phosphorylation is pi3k/akt-dependent.

the role of pi3k/akt signaling cascades in the regulation of nf-κb transactivation remains controversial. the present study agrees with previous investigators in demonstrating that activation of pi3k/akt promotes the activation of p <dig>  <cit> , while some others found that inhibition of the pi3k/akt pathway augmented p <dig> activation  <cit> . we also analyzed how h. pylori-stimulated pi3k activation leads to the activation of nf-κb, and identified a pathway initiated by the pi3k activation that is distinct from nf-κb dna binding. in contrast to the lack of effect of inhibition of pi3k on nf-κb dna binding, pretreatment of mkn <dig> cells with ly <dig> resulted in marked inhibition of h. pylori-stimulated p <dig> phosphorylation and the ability of h. pylori to activate nf-κb-dependent transcription. furthermore, a dominant-negative derivative of akt blocked the ability of h. pylori to activate an nf-κb-dependent promoter. therefore, the results established a clear role of pi3k and its downstream effector akt in modulating the transactivation potential of p <dig>  however, the kinases and signaling pathway responsible for h. pylori-induced p <dig> phosphorylation remain unknown. our data demonstrated for the first time that pi3k and akt participate in h. pylori-mediated nf-κb transcriptional activity. further studies are required to define the exact signaling cascade involved in bacteria-induced p <dig> phosphorylation and nf-κb activity.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrated the role of pi3k/akt in h. pylori-induced nf-κb transcriptional activity and subsequent il- <dig> production in gastric epithelial cells. we also demonstrated an important role of pi3k/akt in the regulation of gastric responses to h. pylori infection, thereby elucidating a novel mechanism that controls both transcription and gene expression in bacterial pathogenesis.
