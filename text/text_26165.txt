BACKGROUND
although ngs techniques advanced rapidly over the last years and sequencing of entire mitochondrial genomes  has consequently become more common  <cit> , knowledge about stylommatophoran  mitogenomes seems to have advanced at a slower pace. for over two decades, the complete mitogenomes of only two stylommatophorans, cepaea nemoralis  <cit>  and albinaria caerulea  <cit> , had been known. of a third species, euhadra herklotsi, most of the mitogenome has been covered, so comparisons of mitochondrial gene arrangements could be made  <cit> , but a complete sequence for that mitogenome is still missing  <cit> . sequencing mitogenomes has been quite cumbersome because enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction  was quite laborious  <cit> . moreover, the throughput of traditional  sequencing is limited and sequencing of larger  fragments is often delayed by the development of internal primers . with ngs technologies, primer-directed amplification is no longer necessary and genome sequencing, mitogenomes in particular because of the small size and high-copy-number, has become fast and easy.

nearly all traditional   <cit>  and still some ngs  <cit>  approaches for sequencing mitogenomes rely on long range pcr amplification. due to the often degraded state of the dna, this by and large excludes the use of specimens from natural history collections. an alternative is the hybridization capture approach  <cit> , but this requires a priori sequence knowledge in order to design probes. although enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction by long range pcr will increase the chance of obtaining a complete mitogenome , it is not essential to ngs . in fact, the first step in ngs library preparation is fragmentation of the dna. consequently, dna sequence data might be obtained from specimens of natural history collections with ngs, where pcr-based approaches fail. whether ngs will allow, e.g. the recovery of complete mitogenomes from collection specimens, will depend on various parameters such as: the extent of dna degradation, the ratio of nuclear to extrachromosomal dna  and the number and length of the obtained sequences . to the best of our knowledge, mitogenomes from ngs studies are thus far obtained either with the use of a long pcr enrichment procedure  <cit>  prior to the ngs run, or with traditional sanger sequencing after the run   <cit> . since each of these approaches relies on pcr, both can be impracticable for  dna retrieved from museum specimens. with this study we wanted to test whether it would be feasible  to obtain a complete mitogenome, without pcr, from a single museum specimen.

we selected c. obtusus because it is an interesting species from both a morphological and a biogeographic point of view. c. obtusus is endemic to the austrian alps where it can be found in calcareous areas  <cit>  at altitudes nearly always above  <dig>  m. it has a disjunct distribution, probably mirroring the small insular areas  in which it survived the last glacial maximum . except for some late pleistocene specimens  <cit>  there is no fossil record for c. obtusus. cylindrus constitutes a monotypic genus. within the helicid subfamily ariantinae it is aberrant by being the only species with a cylindrical shell ; other members of this speciose subfamily have broadly depressed  or globular  shells .

this study shows that ngs can aid in the retrieval of sequence data  without using pcrs. due to dna degradation, pcrs are often a bottleneck for museum specimens. based on our results for a specimen that has been in 70% ethanol for  <dig> years, we plea that ngs could be a promising technique for obtaining sequence data from museum specimens. we report the third complete mitogenome for a species of terrestrial snail ever published and compare our illumina gaiix strategy for sequencing mitogenomes with a similar study  <cit>  in which the  <dig> platform of roche was deployed.

methods
collection and preservation
specimens of c. obtusus were collected by j. gould in  <dig> in großer buchstein , ennstaler alpen  at an elevation of  <dig>  m. after collection the specimens were drowned in water and subsequently placed in ethanol 70%. finally they were stored in the molluscan wet collection of ncb naturalis under collection number rmnh. mol. <dig> 

dna extraction and quality assessment
dna was extracted from a single specimen with a dneasy blood and tissue kit . apart from using a total of  <dig> μl of proteinase k and overnight lysis, the manufacturer's instructions were followed. the dna concentration of the extract was measured on a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer  and checked on an agarose gel.

confirmation of ngs output
because only a small number of c. obtusus  sequences were present in genbank  <cit> , we tried to sequence coi and cytb which would allow the identification of mitochondrial contig sequences . to do so, the following primers were selected: l <dig> & h <dig> for coi  <cit>  and ucytb151f & ucytb270r for cytb  <cit> . pcrs were performed in  <dig> μl volumes using  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm dntps,  <dig>  mm of each primer and  <dig>  μl  of taq dna polymerase . a thermoprofile of  <dig> min. at 94°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec. at 94°c,  <dig> sec. at 50°c and  <dig> sec. at 72°c, and a final extension of  <dig> min. at 72°c was used for both markers. the pcr products were sent to macrogen europe  where they were purified with a montage purification kit  and sequenced in both directions  on an abi3730xl. contigs of forward and reverse sequences were assembled with sequencher v.  <dig> . <dig> 

assessing limitations of the dna extract: long range pcr
although the aim of this study is to assess the possibility of sequencing a complete mitogenome without pcrs from a collection specimen, the underlying assumption is that enrichment of the target sequence by primer-directed amplification will be difficult or impossible for these kinds of object. to test this assumption, we tried to enrich the mitochondrial fraction of the obtained dna extract by means of long range pcr. to inrease the chance of successfully amplifying the complete mitochondrion, two cylindrus specific primer sets  were designed that each amplified  half of the mitochondrion. these two primer-sets were tested with the "expand long template pcr system" of roche , following the manufacturer's protocol. primer-sets a and b were designed with primer <dig>  <cit>  and face outward of the obtained coi and cytb sequences:

a-cobt-coi- 5'-ttacaactatttttaatatgcgttctcct-3' &

a-cobt-cb- 5'-cgacgagaaataaaacatttaacataacta-3' and

b-cobt-cb- 5'- taccttttgtgattagtgtttttgtgttat-3' &

b-cobt-coi- 5'- tattatttatccggggaaaccttatatc-3'

we assumed that the orientation of coi and cytb would be identical to that of c. nemoralis.

gaiix library preparation
for dna extracts from fresh tissues, the first step in library preparation is fragmentation of  dna. for extracts from museum specimens, dna can already expected to be fragmented, which would make this step unnecessary or even detrimental . the extent of dna degradation will depend heavily on the preservation history. based on the quality assessment of our dna extract and the adverse effect that improperly fragmented dna has on gaiix runs, we decided to follow a general library preparation procedure, for which we used the nebnext™ dna sample prep kit . the dna extract was randomly sheared with a nebulizer  for  <dig> min. at  <dig>  bar  to obtain fragments in the range of 200- <dig> nucleotides. fragments with a length of ca.  <dig> bp  were extracted from an ms8-agarose gel  with a zymoclean gel dna recovery kit . for all subsequent steps the nebnext™ dna sample prep kit protocol was followed.

gaiix run and data analysis
the prepared library was run at baseclear b.v.  on a single lane of a gaiix flow cell. clc genomics workbench version  <dig>   was used to filter the output and for de novo assembly.

annotation of the mitogenome
the contig sequence was annotated, based on similarity with available sequences in genbank , using pairwise alignments with, in particular, c. nemoralis and with the organellar genome annotation program dogma  <cit> . in order for dogma to detect all potential trnas  we ultimately set the cove-score to zero, but even then still some were missing. therefore, the programs trnascan  <cit>  and arwen  <cit>  were used as well.

RESULTS
dna extraction
the dna extract for the selected c. obtusus specimen had a yield  <dig> μg  and degradation as judged on the agarose gel was limited, considering the age of the specimen.

pcr assessment
the pcrs for the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp  fragments of cytb and coi, respectively, worked on the first attempt and were directly sequenced. we failed to make the long pcrs work; with our c. obtusus specific primers , nor with any combination of the "universal" primers that successfully amplified the shorter coi and cytb sequences .

illumina gaiix run
the gaiix run resulted in  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average read length of  <dig> nucleotides. of these  <dig>  reads were overlapping and used for a de novo assembly . this resulted in  <dig> contigs with a total length of  <dig>  bp. the largest contig had a length of  <dig>  nucleotides and an average coverage of  <dig>  ×. the latter contig was identified as the mitogenome of c. obtusus based on the expected length , the presence of the coi and cytb sequences  and on similarity with mitochondrial sequences from other stylommatophorans as resulting from blast searches.

initial assignment of pcgs and rrnas
twelve of the expected  <dig> protein-coding genes , as well as both of the ribosomal rnas  were recognized by dogma  <cit> ; atp <dig> had to be located based on a pairwise alignment with c. nemoralis and a. caerulea. although the gene arrangement  as assigned by dogma seemed correct , the program had difficulties determining the gene boundaries . since we lack data from peptide sequencing for any of the pcgs, the putative gene boundaries  were determined based on pairwise alignments with the amino acid sequences of c. nemoralis, a. caerulae and e. herklotsi. nine of the pcgs start with a common initiation codon ; the other four start with less common  initiation codons . for four pcgs  we had to infer that they ended with a truncated termination codon .

annotation of rrnas
the conserved regions at the beginning and end of both rrnas  were found in the contig sequence of c. obtusus as well. however, for both a. caerulea and c. nemoralis, the annotation of rrns  and rrnl  extends beyond these conserved regions. even though the exact gene boundaries of these ribosomal genes need to be confirmed by transcript mapping, the sequence data for a. caerulea and c. nemoralis show little to no space between the rrnas and the surrounding trnas. consequently, we based the putative boundaries of 12s and 16s  on alignments with sequences of the just mentioned species for those genes and the position of the surrounding trnas .

annotation of trnas
because of the low cove-score, half of the trnas assigned by dogma  were false positives, but even with these relaxed settings trna-p, -g, - s <dig> , - i and -k were missed. none of the missing trnas could be detected with trnascan. using the least restrictive parameters, trnascan yielded no false positives, but merely detected four trnas , -n, -m and -t) that were already assigned by dogma. of the three programs tested, only arwen found  <dig> of the  <dig> trnas at the cost of just one false positive. when the output of arwen and dogma was combined, all trnas except trna-g were assigned. apart from a swap between trna-p and trna-a, the gene order for c. obtusus is identical to that of c. nemoralis. alignments that included sequences of both a. caerulea and c. nemoralis  <cit>  showed that trna-g is located between trna-w and trna-h. in the annotated mitochondrion of c. obtusus , there is indeed an unassigned region between trna-w and trna-h. an alignment with sequences of c. obtusus, a. caerulea and c. nemoralis showed a conserved sequence, taccttccaag  within this non-annotated region of c. obtusus, which represents the anticodon loop and part of the anticodon stem of trna-g. consequently, this alignment was used to infer the approximate location of trna-g, even though the secundary structure for this trna could not be predicted. additionally, the location of each trnext-link-id=""a was confirmed by the presence of the anti-codon. a map of the mitogenome of c. obtusus is depicted in figure  <dig>  a summary of the mitochondrial genome content is given in table  <dig>  the corresponding annotated sequence was deposited in genbank under accession number jn <dig> 

discussion
at present, ngs techniques are being used increasingly in mitogenomic studies. one of the commonly used platforms is roche  <dig>  <cit> . the ability to generate longer reads  and the reduction in sequence costs as compared to illumina gaiix, undoubtedly has added to the popularity of this platform. an overview of the costs and read lengths of these  ngs platforms is given in glen et al.  <cit> . when sequencing mitogenomes from museum specimens  <cit>  the ability to sequence longer dna fragments likely is of no advantage and such studies generally rely on platforms that are optimized for short fragments, such as illumina gaiix. despite the momentum that ngs has provided for ancient dna research  <cit> , the number of mitogenomic studies that actually use these new techniques to exploit natural history collections still is rather limited. this paper provides an example of how ngs technology can be used to retrieve genetic information from a museum specimen. we show that it is feasible to sequence a complete mitogenome, without pcr, from a snail that has been in 70% ethanol for eight years.

thus far, to the best of our knowledge, only  <cit>  made use of an ngs platform to sequence the complete mitogenome of another gastropod. in that study, a similar approach  was taken, albeit with freshly collected specimens and a different ngs platform . despite the commonalites, there were some noteworthy differences between both studies as well. firstly,  <cit>  used  <dig> specimens to obtain a complete mitogenome, whereas our results were obtained from a single specimen. the rationale behind using this many specimens is not given by the latter authors; perhaps they wished to account for intraspecific heterogeneity between the selected populations. it had nothing to do with the 'sensitivity' of the different platforms; the amount of dna that feldmeyer et al.  <cit>  used for their sample preparation , was roughly similar to what was used in this study . the ability to obtain a complete mitogenomic sequence from a single specimen obviously is an advantage. secondly, in contrast to our gaiix run, the  <dig> run did not cover the complete mitogenome, requiring the design of additional primers and sanger sequencing to close the three gaps that were left over after assembly. this is also observed in other mitogenomic studies in which the  <dig> platform was used without prior enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction  <cit> . after filtering, the  <dig> run resulted in  <dig> reads with an average length of  <dig> nt  <cit>  that could be assigned to the mitochondrial genome, compared to  <dig>  reads  with an average length of  <dig> nt obtained with gaiix. thus the  <dig> run resulted in  <dig>  mitogenomic nucleotides, whereas our gaiix run yielded  <dig> . the maximum coverage obtained with  <dig> and gaiix is  <dig> × and  <dig> × for r. balthica and c. obtusus for mitogenome sizes of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. generally longer reads as obtained with the  <dig> platform facilitate de novo assembly and might be preferred when little a priori sequence information is available . when reconstructing the just mentioned mitogenomes the sheer number of short reads generated by the gaiix platform outcompeted the smaller number of longer reads as obtained with  <dig> sequencing.

identification of trnas in nematodes  <cit>  and stylommatophorans  <cit>  can be difficult because the standard cloverleaf secondary structure may not be present  and pulmonate trnas can undergo post-transcriptional processing  <cit> . in a number of instances different trnas were predicted in the same approximate nucleotide region, depending on the algorithm used. the hypothetical trnas differed a few nucleotides in length, or were shifted a few bases, or both, causing a slight shift in the anti-codon region. despite the fact that only one of the trnas will be real, both algorithms correctly point to  the same nucleotide region for the placement of a trna. in other instances, the different algorithms predicted trnas on exactly the same position but on opposite strands, causing the trnas to be the reverse-complement of each other  <cit> . examples of the latter within c. obtusus are predictions by dogma of trna-w and trna-c on position 3632- <dig> and 3232- <dig>  for which arwen predicted trna-p and trna-a, respectively. for both trnas, only those predicted by arwen were in agreement with existing annotations for related species in genbank.

although gene rearrangements are common in the mitogenomes of molluscs  <cit>  and gastropods in particular  <cit> , little is known about the mitochondrial gene organisation of terrestrial snails. the mt gene arrangements depicted by yamazaki et al.  <cit>  and boore et al.  <cit>  show less similarity between c. nemoralis and e. herklotsi , than between each of them and a. caerulea . based on a three-taxon statement yamazaki et al.  <cit>  concluded that the rearrangement of the trnas between coii and atp <dig> represented a derived state in e. herklotsi. similarly, they concluded that the positions of trna-p and the gene-region trna-t/coiii represented a derived state in c. nemoralis. by comparing these gene rearrangements with the gene order observed in c. obtusus, we can get some insight in the evolution of the mitochondrial gene order of the helicoidea. figure  <dig> gives an overview of the gene organisation of the four stylommatophoran mitogenomes currently known. starting at coi the first observed rearrangement is the relocation of trna-p within c. nemoralis. although the location of trna-p in c. obtusus is the same as that found within the other stylommatophorans, the gene region itself seems to be of high potential for rearrangements within the helicidae. in c. obtusus we see that instead of trna-p, trna-a has been relocated between nd <dig> and nd <dig>  thus within the stylommatophora, the relocation of a trna from the l <dig>  a, p-region to between nd <dig> and nd <dig> seems to be a synapomorphy for the helicidae. the second gene rearrangement  is found in e. herklotsi within a series of trnas located between coii and atp <dig>  despite the fact that these trnas  have rearranged frequently during gastropod evolution  <cit> , the gene order seems rather conserved within the eupulmonata. the five eupulmonates currently listed in the genome database of ncbi and c. obtusus all show the order y, w, g, h, q, l <dig>  therefore, we endorse the conclusion of yamazaki et al.  <cit>  that the arrangement of these trnas as observed in e. herklotsi can be considered a derived state . presence of the ancestral trna arrangement in both c. obtusus and c. nemoralis, suggests that that gene order has not changed in the helicidae. the last gene rearrangement is the relocation of the gene-region trna-t/coiii in c. nemoralis from between nd <dig> and nd <dig> to between nd <dig> and nd <dig>  exactly the same rearrangement is also observed in c. obtusus, likely indicating an apomorphy for the helicidae.

most metazoan mitogenomes possess a single major non-coding region presumed to contain the signals for replication and transcription. this region is usually referred to as the control region  <cit> . in some groups of invertebrates, such as gastropods  <cit>  and spiders  <cit>  the mitogenomes can be very compact, hardly leaving any non-coding regions of significant length. although the mitogenome of c. obtusus  is still compact compared to that of other metazoa , it is about half a kb larger than the mitogenomes of c. nemoralis  and a. caerulea . the schematic overview of this mitogenome  shows three unassigned regions  with a length of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt, respectively. when the mitochondrial gene order of c. obtusus is compared with that of other stylommatophorans currently known , it becomes clear that region i and iii coincide with the transposition of trna-a and the region trna-t/coiii. as for region ii, no gene rearrangement was observed in c. obtusus and neither c. nemoralis nor a. caerulea have any unassigned sequence between trna-w and trna-g. but then e. herklotsi does show a gene rearrangement in that region . in stylommatophorans  the location of the mitochondrial control region is still a subject of debate. given the absence of region ii in other stylommatophorans, we believe that of the three non-coding regions, region ii is the least likely location for the control region. as for region i, grande et al.  <cit>  suggested that the region between nd <dig> and nd <dig> might contain recognition signals for transcription in the nudibranch roboastra europaea. except for onchidella celtica, which, like c. obtusus, has its longest non-coding sequence here  <cit> , most of the heterobranch gastropods sequenced thus far show very little unassigned sequence between nd <dig> and nd <dig>  therefore we assume that region i is not the most likely location for the control region either. within the heterobranch gastropods the region between coiii and trna-i is most often cited as the potential location for the control region  <cit> . because of the shown transposition of trna-t/coiii within c. nemoralis and c. obtusus , this region was transposed as well. thus for those species , the potential control region  is not located between coiii and trna-i, but between coiii and trna-s <dig>  for a. caerulea and pupa strigosa, the presence of  <dig> nt  and  <dig> nt palindromes, respectively  <cit> , has been implicated to function as a bidrectional promotor for this putative control region. within c. obtusus, c. nemoralis and e. herklotsi, the palindromes found in this region were never larger than six nucleotides. we were unable to confidently align the putative control region for the four mentioned stylommatophorans. the length of this region was longer in the helicidae  than in the other two stylommatophorans , which is most certainly related to the transposition of trna-t/coiii. besides the apparent consistency of the presence of a non-coding region adjacent to coiii, there still is little to go on for recognition of the control region in heterobranch gastropods. given the limited number of available stylommatophoran  mitogenomes , we consider more extensive genomic comparisons  to be premature, based on these data.

although this study illustrates the potential of ngs to obtain genetic information from museum specimens, there are some caveats that need to be addressed. as for the results of the long range pcr, we did not have a recently collected specimen of c. obtusus at our disposal. therefore, we have not shown that the failure of the long range pcr was caused by the fact that we used an 'aged' collection specimen. otherwise, no products would have been obtained with the long range pcrs either, based, as they were, on the universal primers, which were shown to work with c. obtusus. the fact that an ngs approach worked well in this study, also does not imply that ngs approaches will always be fruitful when applied to collection specimens. a vast number of parameters such as the effect of fixatives, time  and preservation history were not assessed in this study. also annotation of a mitogenome largely based on similarity with available sequences in genbank  is hazardous. closely related species might not be present and existing annotations are not guaranteed to be flawless  <cit> . another hypothetical problem is that due to the relative short length of the obtained sequences  repeats within the mitogenome could be missed. the mitogenomes of gastropods however are very compact, none of stylommatophorans sequenced thus far show such repeats and the length of the complete mt sequence is similar to that of other stylommatophorans. we therefore assume that the mitogenome of c. obtusus presented here is complete. based on the sheer number of sequences generated with gaiix and  <dig>  we are convinced that without pcrs it will be more difficult to obtain a complete mitogenome with the latter platform . even though our gaiix approach is reasonably similar to the  <dig> approach described by feldmeyer et al.  <cit> , the comparison will not be conclusive as long as the total genome sizes of c. obtusus and r. balthica are unknown. the average genome size  of available stylommatophorans  compared to basommatophorans  nevertheless suggest that it will be more difficult to obtain the mitogenome of c. obtusus than that of r. balthica. it is likely that the assembly of mitogenomes will benefit from the advances in ngs technologies , as well as from the promising arrival of third generation sequencers .

CONCLUSIONS
on a par with previous studies  <cit> , this study shows that ngs can aid in the retrieval of mitogenomes from museum specimens. although sequencing of mitogenomes by means of ngs without an enrichment procedure is very inefficient , it eliminates the use of pcrs which is often a bottleneck for degraded dna samples. without prior enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction, the gaiix platform  might be better suited for de novo sequencing of mitogenomes than the  <dig> platform . besides being much faster than conventional sequencing , sequencing of mitogenomes by means of ngs also yields higher confidence estimates . except for a swap between trna-p and trna-a, the mitochondrial gene arrangement of c. obtusus is identical to that of c. nemoralis. within the helicidae the region trna-l <dig>  p, a might be a hot spot for transposition of genes . the location of trna-t/coiii between nd <dig> and nd <dig>  might be an apomorphy for the family helicidae. we hope that the results of this study will aid to future studies on stylommatophoran evolution and the phylogeny of the subfamily ariantinae in particular.
