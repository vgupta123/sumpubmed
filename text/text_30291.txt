BACKGROUND
the human body has evolved multiple mechanisms to provide nutritional immunity including those involved in sequestration of extracellular iron and heme. bacterial pathogens have co-evolved multiple mechanisms to overcome these defenses and to utilize the sequestered micronutrients. haemophilus influenzae is a human-specific pathogen that commonly resides as a commensal of the nasopharyngeal cavity. h. influenzae can ascend the eustachian tube and cause otitis media  in children, can spread to cause disease in the lungs of patients with copd and cystic fibrosis, and also can cause invasive disease  <cit> . these multiple environments inhabited by h. influenzae are all likely to be iron and heme  restricted and are likely to differ in the iron and/or heme sources available to colonizing or invading bacteria. to overcome this fehm restriction and utilize the multiplicity of possible fehm sources, h. influenzae has evolved a complex array of mechanisms that specifically target iron- or heme-containing proteins as sources of these essential micronutrients  <cit> .

h. influenzae has an absolute growth requirement for heme. the requirement is specifically for the immediate heme precursor, protoporphyrin ix , since most strains possess the enzyme ferrochelatase  <cit> . in the human host, there is essentially no free ppix, and the potential sources of heme are intracellular, in the form of hemoglobin or heme-containing enzymes such as the cytochromes, that are unavailable to invading microorganisms  <cit> . hemoglobin released by lysis of erythrocytes is avidly bound by the serum protein haptoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation by hepatocytes  <cit> . free heme, principally derived from the breakdown of methemoglobin, is bound by either of the serum proteins hemopexin or albumin and cleared from the circulatory system by hepatocytes  <cit> . utilization of hemoglobin, the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex, heme-hemopexin and heme-albumin complexes by h. influenzae requires a functional tonb gene indicating that uptake of heme from these host sources is mediated by tonb-dependent outer membrane proteins   <cit> . an additional source of iron is serum ferri-transferrin, the utilization of which is mediated by the td-omp tbpa  <cit> . previous studies have characterized both the potential human sources of iron and heme, including transferrin, hemoglobin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin, and the heme-hemopexin and heme-albumin complexes  <cit> , as well as many of the omps mediating their utilization. these include the hemoglobin/hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding td-omps   <cit> , theheme-utilization td-omp   <cit> , and the heme-hemopexin td-omp  are regulated by the environmental availability of fehm, and are preferentially transcribed under fehm-restricted growth conditions  <cit> .

previously, we characterized the transcriptional changes that occur upon transition from a fehm-starved to a fehm-replete environment in three unrelated fully sequenced h. influenzae isolates, the extensively passaged laboratory strain rd kw <dig>  the type b h. influenaze  strain  <dig> and the invasive non-typeable  strain r <dig>  <cit> . these data established that rd kw <dig> had  <dig> genes responding whereas the two clinical isolates had significantly more such genes . transcription of  <dig> genes was altered by fehm levels in all three strains. in addition, each isolate had several genes whose regulation was unique to that isolate. rd kw <dig> had  <dig> genes that were upregulated by fehm restriction that were present, but not regulated, in the other isolates. strain  <dig> had  <dig> and r <dig> had  <dig> such genes. each isolate also had a subset of genes that were both distinct to that isolate and responsive to fehm levels. rd kw <dig> had a single unique gene upregulated during fehm restricted growth. in contrast,  <dig> had  <dig> and r <dig> had  <dig> similarly unique and regulated genes  <cit> . overall, strains  <dig> and r <dig> more closely resembled one another in their transcriptional profiles than either resembled strains rd kw <dig>  taken together, these data demonstrate that substantial heterogeneity exists among the individual fehm-responsive modulons of these h. influenzae isolates. nevertheless, these studies allowed us to define a core modulon of fehm-responsive genes, numbering  <dig>  that were responsive to alterations in fehm levels in all three studied h. influenzae isolates.

the current study had two specific goals: 1) to further evaluate the fehm-core regulon of h. influenzae by characterizing the in vitro transcriptomes of two additional nthi strains, 86-028np and r <dig> which were isolated from the nasopharynx and the middle ear, respectively, of children with om.; 2) to assess whether the regulation of gene transcription by fehm levels in vitro accurately reflects the transcriptional status of the same genes in vivo in an animal model of acute om.

RESULTS
defining the fehm window of nthi 86-028np and r <dig> for microarray analysis
previously the growth conditions required to establish the fehm-responsive genes of three h. influenzae strains were carefully defined  <cit> . in these previous studies the growth parameters included preincubation of the primary inoculum in growth medium containing heme at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml prior to inoculation of the experimental culture. initially the same growth protocol was used in the transcriptional analysis of isolates 86-028np and r <dig> reported herein. under these conditions both isolates lost viability during the experimental growth period and the rna yields from each were significantly decreased compared to the previous isolates studied. in previous experiments the h. influenzae isolates rd kw <dig>  r <dig> and  <dig> showed a continuous growth over the period of the experiment  <cit> . in contrast, nthi 86-028np showed a similar growth profile to approximately 90 minutes, with peak cfu values of  <dig> x <dig>  but displayed a subsequent decrease thereafter to  <dig>  x  <dig>  cfu at 150 minutes. isolate r <dig> showed a similar profile to 86-028np. rna samples at  <dig> and 110 minutes from various experimental replicates showed varying yields of both total rna and specific target mrna, which resulted in a failure of the q-pcr to analyze the potentially fehm regulated genes. thus, a systematic approach was taken to determine optimal conditions for analysis of in vitro gene transcription of these isolates. it seemed possible loss of viability of the isolates resulted from a deficiency of heme in the primary inoculum. as a result, a range of heme concentrations in the preincubation step were tested. when the inoculum culture was incubated at 2 μg/ml heme, both isolates retained viability across the period of the experiment and consistent transcriptional data was obtained. using a set of test genes that included hita, tbp <dig>  hxuc and ompp <dig>  we found that the kinetics of fehm-mediated transcriptional regulation were similar to those observed for the three previously studied h. influenzae strains .

microarray analysis of isolates nthi 86-028np and r2846
a microarray chip was designed that contained all the coding regions of the nthi isolates 86-028np and r <dig>  the same chip had been previously utilized to study the fehm modulons of the hib strain  <dig> and the nthi strain r <dig>  <cit> . triplicate cultures of each isolate were prepared and sampled as previously described  <cit> .

approximately 50–60 μg total rna was purified from each experimental sample and submitted to nimblegen inc., where the samples underwent in-house quality control prior to microarray analysis. of the  <dig> orfs on the array corresponding to nthi 86-028np genes,  <dig>  were differentially transcribed in a statistically significant manner . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were preferentially transcribed in fehm-restricted conditions and  <dig>  were maximally transcribed in fehm-replete conditions. of the  <dig> orfs represented on the array that correspond to nthi r <dig> genes,  <dig>  were significantly differentially transcribed. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were maximally transcribed in fehm-restricted conditions and  <dig>  in fehm-replete conditions . in both sets of microarray data, transcripts of the known fehm-repressible genes tbp <dig>  hita and hxuc were elevated under fehm restriction while transcripts of the constitutive gene ompp <dig> showed no significant changes in either isolate. these findings were in accordance with the preliminary quantitative pcr  experiments. . in comparison with the previous microarray studies, the number of genes responding to altered fehm status is lower in both 86-028np and r <dig> than was observed for the previously reported isolates. this discrepancy may reflect the resulting effect of the additional heme required in the initial growth of the inocula cultures for these isolates.

validation of the microarray data
several genes were selected for analysis by q-pcr to validate the microarray data. a separate experiment was performed for each isolate to purify rna from fehm-deplete and -replete cells using the same conditions as those described for the microarray analysis. genes analyzed for each isolate included ten examples of genes preferentially expressed under fehm limitation or supplementation. we observed concordance of 100% between the q-pcr and the microarray transcription data .

comparison of the microarray data of h. influenzae isolates 86-028np, r <dig>  r <dig>  rd kw <dig> and 10810
in an initial analysis of the fehm-responsive genes of h. influenzae, the well-characterized laboratory strain rd kw <dig> had  <dig> fehm-ve genes and  <dig> fehm + ve genes  <cit> . addition of data from the hib isolate  <dig> and the nthi isolate r <dig>  subsequently established a common core of  <dig> fehm-ve and  <dig> fehm + ve genes responding to fehm availability in these  <dig> strains  <cit> . combining that data with the newly acquired data from r <dig> and 86-028np now allows the further refinement of the definition of the core fehm modulon for the species h. influenzae. we now define a gene as a member of this modulon if it is significantly regulated in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates evaluated. in a few operons, one or two genes distal to the promoter may have fallen below the  <dig> -fold inclusion limit but were included as part of the core if they were regulated in at least  <dig> isolates. the core fehm modulon of the  <dig> isolates contains  <dig> genes that are preferentially transcribed under fehm-deplete conditions and  <dig> genes that are preferentially transcribed under fehm-replete conditions . of the fehm-ve genes the majority  have a known or putative role in iron and/or heme uptake. genes encoding the characterized heme-hemopexin uptake system , the transferrin uptake system , the energy transducing tonbexbbexbd system and the inner membrane iron transporter hitabc were significantly upregulated in all five isolates. several genes whose products are predicted to be directly involved in uptake of heme across the om were also regulated in all strains. these include a probable heme uptake receptor hemr , the td-omp designated hi <dig> in rd kw <dig>  and ompu . several other fehm-related genes were also found to be regulated in four isolates. these include genes encoding the hemoglobin-haptoglobin receptors hgpb and hgpc and the putative inner membrane divalent cation transporter system yfeabcd.

among the  <dig> core genes preferentially expressed under fehm-replete conditions, only six were regulated in all  <dig> isolates. these include genes encoding the ferritin subunits  as well as a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogense , two components of the nitrate reduction complex , and a cytochrome c biogenesis gene .

comparison of the  <dig> genome core, with the previously described  <dig> genome core
a previous iteration of the fehm-responsive core modulon of h. influenzae was based on microarray analyses of  <dig> isolates  <cit> . for the fehm-ve gene set inclusion of the two additional strains reported herein resulted in the exclusion of  <dig> genes included in the previous 3-genome based core modulon and the addition of  <dig> genes that were previously excluded. none of the  <dig> genes that were removed from the fehm-ve core are believed to be directly involved in fehm acquisition. however, additions to the consensus fehm-ve core include many genes with an established or putative role in fehm homeostasis. one locus added to the fehm-ve core as a result of the current study is the the yfeabcd locus . this locus was previously excluded since it is constitutively expressed in the hib strain  <dig>  possibly as a result of a nucleotide substitution within a putative fur box upstream of the gene  <cit> . the inclusion of the yfeabcd locus in the modified core reported herein attests to the value of multi-genome analysis for the definition of regulons within a species. other genes added to the core included some within operons in which the first gene was previously reported as part of the 3-genome core.

an even greater degree of change was seen for the set of genes preferentially expressed under fehm-replete conditions. twenty five genes that were part of the 3-genome core were excluded from the 5-genome core while eight genes were added. of the  <dig> added genes, six are members of the locus encoding components of the nitrate reductase complex, napdaghbc . another added gene was the promoter proximal gene of the fdnghie  operon which encodes a nitrate-inducible formate dehydrogenase. this gene had been excluded from the previous rd kw <dig> array although it was subsequently shown by q-pcr to be regulated in that isolate. the last added gene was within the nfrabcd  operon, the other genes of which were already included in the core. these three operons include  <dig> of  <dig> genes  included in the final fehm + ve core.

there were  <dig> genes in  <dig> putative operons that did not exhibit significant changes in transcription in either r <dig> or 86-028np but were regulated by fehm in the previous studies with rd kw <dig>   <dig> and r <dig>  <cit> . given the additional heme required to maintain viability in strains r <dig> and 86-028np, these genes may represent loci whose expression is only altered under extreme fehm stress. examination of these genes revealed no clear pattern of expression beyond a suggestion that the lower fehm levels have more profoundly stressed the cells. genes that are preferentially expressed in fehm deplete conditions in the three original isolates include those that encode a protein that replaces an oxidatively-damaged pyruvate lyase subunit, several transporters and associated utilization proteins , a periplasmic nad nucleotidase involved in nad and nad scavenging, a stationary phase translation inhibitor and a trna recycling protein, the dps protein that protects dna from oxidative damage, and several other enzymes. among genes preferentially expressed following the return to fehm-replete conditions,  <dig> of the  <dig> are genes whose products are involved in trna or ribosome maturation. this suggests that protein synthesis may have been suppressed during fehm stress. the remaining genes have only putative assigned functions.

in vitro examination of the fehm core modulon in the clinical nthi isolate hi1722
we were unable to utilize strain r <dig> for in vivo studies since in preliminary experiments in the chinchilla infected animals rapidly developed symptoms of inner ear infection which represent criteria for termination of the protocol. as a result an alternate strain was selected for in vivo determination of transcription. the nthi isolate hi <dig> was chosen for these studies because it was isolated from a patient with om and has been previously utilized in the chinchilla model of om  <cit> . to facilitate the in vivo examination, this isolate was partially genome sequenced to determine the presence or absence of core fehm-responsive genes and the sequence of individual genes to ensure homology of the q-pcr primers. similarly to the nthi strains 86-028np and r <dig>  strain hi <dig> required preincubation with 2 μg/ml heme to prevent cell death over the time course of the regulation studies . initially the transcriptional response of the genes tbp <dig>  hxuc, and ompp <dig> were examined. similar kinetics of expression were observed for each gene as those previously described for the five other isolates previously examined .

the transcriptional profiles of the genes comprising the 5-genome fehm-responsive core were examined in hi <dig> by q-pcr. for genes in operons, a single gene was chosen as representative of the operon. of the  <dig> operons in the fehm core  <dig> were regulated in this previously unstudied isolate including every operon that was fehm responsive in all  <dig> previously studied isolates . in addition,  <dig> genes unresponsive to fehm levels in any of the previously studied strains were selected as control genes and the transcript levels determined for hi <dig>  transcript levels of all  <dig> control genes did not change in response to fehm levels in hi <dig> .

transcriptional status of the core modulon of 86-028-np and hi <dig> during experimental om in the chinchilla
a major goal of this study was to determine the in vivo transcriptional status of the core fehm-modulon genes in the chinchilla middle ear a clinically relevant animal model of disease. to allow a direct comparison of transcript levels between the in vivo and in vitro derived samples, each was normalized to the time zero fehm supplemented in vitro grown culture of the respective isolate. in this way the expression level determined by q-pcr of the ear samples can be compared to the in vitro fehm deplete/supplemented values since they are all normalized to the same internal “housekeeping” gene gyra. in essence, the in vitro data provide two indices of transcriptional status, an upper level, corresponding to upregulation and a lower level corresponding to fully fehm repressed basal transcription. for each gene in the fehm core, the fold change in transcripts in response to fehm addition in vitro had been determined . since a fully repressed sample is used as a normalizer, all the other values are “fold change with respect to full repression” thus positive numbers above  <dig>  indicate increased transcription, values between +/-  <dig>  are not considered indicative of a change and values below - <dig>  are further repressed. to test the hypothesis that genes in the fehm core are transcribed in vivo, cohorts of chinchillas were infected and ear effusion samples were collected at various times for determination of the transcriptional status of genes in the fehm core modulon. following q-pcr of each gene of interest in each sample, a set of profiles of transcription for each gene was determined and compared to the in vitro data. table  <dig> displays the q-pcr results  for each gene in each isolate together with the data of the in vitro grown samples . individual data points for each gene, for each day are shown in additional file 3: q-pcr values for fehm core genes in 86-028np infected chinchilla ears and in additional file 4: q-pcr values for fehm core genes in hi <dig> infected chinchilla ears. for most genes, the in vivo level of transcripts was similar to, or in excess of, the in vitro data for fehm-restricted conditions. values are bolded where the transcripts of a gene showed either a fold change below our cut off  of a fold change opposite to that predicted by the in vitro fehm regulon. in addition, the transcriptional status of the selected genes appears to be relatively stable across the duration of the experiment , indicating that over the course of the experiment the middle ear fluids remained fehm restricted. several interesting observations were noted when the in vivo and in vitro data for the two isolates were compared. for genes observed to be preferentially expressed in fehm-deplete conditions in the microarray studies, nearly all were expressed at a high level in vivo. however, many of the operons that were preferentially expressed in fehm-replete conditions were also expressed at a higher level in the in vivo samples for both isolates. the only exceptions were the adhc and ftna genes. a likely explanation for this is that the microenvironment may contain additional physiological signals such as nutrient depletion, redox stress and other such stimuli which may lead to expression of these genes in this environ. a second interesting observation is the low expression levels of exbb in the 86-028np in vivo data . this finding was confirmed by determination of the transcript levels of tonb in each of the 86-028np ear samples. the results were consistent with the lower expression of exbb in the chinchilla ear . for the hi <dig> isolate, each of the core fehm-ve modulon genes were significantly upregulated in the in vivo samples. taken in its entirety, the data discussed in this section confirm that the chinchilla ear fluids remain fehm-limited during the period of the experimental infection.

discussion
the two main goals of this study were to refine the core of fehm-modulated genes for the species h. influenzae and assess the correlation of transcriptional profiles observed during experimental om. in performing the in vitro studies it was clear that not all h. influenzae isolates are equally resistant to prolonged fehm starvation. in previous studies using the three strains rd kw <dig>   <dig> and r <dig>  incubation of the seed culture with  <dig>  μg/ml heme was sufficient to allow subsequent survival in fehm-deplete media for at least a further two hours and reproducible gene transcript levels over time. however, for the three strains used in the present study  similar conditions led to rapid loss of viability of the isolates and poor reproducibility of transcript analyses. titration of the heme in the preincubation period demonstrated that a minimum of 2 μg/ml heme was required to retain viability of these strains. the physiological reason for this phenomenon is unknown. interestingly, the three isolates reported herein share a similar genetic trait distinct from the isolates in the first study. in each of the isolates there is the insertion of a fehm-modulated hemoglobin-haptoglobin binding protein gene  at a locus containing the polyamine genes, pote and spef, which replaces the latter two genes. in rd kw <dig>   <dig> and r <dig> the pote and spef genes are also fehm regulated. thus, the lack of pote and spef may be responsible for the reported inability to survive protracted fehm starvation. it is possible that the role of the polyamines in pote/spef containing strains is to provide a protective effect during fermentative growth as polyamines have been shown to protect against acid stress  <cit> . it has been previously shown that h. influenzae is able to grow fermentatively with the production of acids as a byproduct  <cit> . in the isolates lacking these genes, the ability to persist under fermentative growth would be limited. thus, a higher initial concentration of heme may be required to provide a sufficient intra-cellular concentration to ensure adequate functional respiratory enzymes and allow respiration over the period of the experiment. further studies are planned to investigate the role of the polyamine locus in long term resistance to fehm starvation. although hgpa and pote/spef share the same genetic location and both are maximally expressed under fehm-depleted conditions, they have distinct upstream regions and are not regulated by the same promoter element .

the individual in vitro fehm modulons indicate that 86-028np and r <dig> are more similar to each other than they are to any of the three isolates characterized in our previous studies  <cit> . this may simply result from the need for additional heme required in the current studies. in the newly described modulons there are fewer regulated genes. this is most pronounced in the subset of genes preferentially expressed under fehm-replete conditions. the majority of the differentially regulated genes appear to be involved in basic metabolism and include various transferases and ribosome-associated proteins. while these genes are regulated in rd kw <dig>  r <dig> and  <dig>  the lack of regulation in r <dig> and 86-028np indicates a difference in the basic metabolism between these two sets of isolates. specifically it suggests that the higher level of heme leads to less of an impact on central metabolism during fehm depletion. thus, the current study may more accurately reflect the genes directly regulated by fehm availability as opposed to those for which the transcriptional status is secondary to the consequences of fehm starvation.

additionally the current study tested the hypothesis that genes preferentially expressed under conditions of fehm starvation would be similarly upregulated in the middle ear during experimental infection. two isolates that have been previously used in the chinchilla model were selected for these studies. in nthi strain hi <dig>  each core gene that was upregulated in fehm-deplete conditions in vitro was also apparently upregulated during experimental otitis media . combined with the observation that nearly all of the fehm-ve genes in 86-028np were also highly transcribed in vivo, these findings validate the hypothesis that h. influenzae genes preferentially transcribed under fehm-limited growth are also transcribed in the middle ear during om.

CONCLUSIONS
the targeted examination of gene regulation in the chinchilla ear reported herein does not address all of the fehm-regulated genes that may contribute to virulence in that environment for any specific isolate. rather the study focused on the core fehm-responsive genes; the microarray studies clearly show that each of the isolates contained additional genes that respond to fehm stress in vitro that did not fulfill criteria for inclusion as core modulon members. it is likely that such non-core fehm-responsive genes will also be upregulated in vivo, and it is likely that more than just core genes are required for survival in the chinchilla ear. the core fehm modulon contains  <dig> genes preferentially transcribed under fehm-deplete conditions and  <dig> genes preferentially transcribed under fehm-replete conditions. however, the total number of fehm-regulated genes in all  <dig> studied isolates is approximately  <dig>  it is likely that the pool of non-core genes allow adaptation to changing hosts and environmental niches within the host. it is known that h. influenzae is naturally transformable and shares genes between co-localized isolates. this is the fundamental principle of the distributed genome hypothesis  <cit>  and may in part explain why there is a large degree of heterogeneity of regulation seen between isolates in vitro, as well as variation in the genomic presence of various genes that are regulated in individual isolates. future studies will focus on identification of all genes preferentially expressed in vivo with a view to obtaining a better understanding of the in vivo systems biology of h. influenzae disease.
