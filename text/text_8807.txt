BACKGROUND
using functional magnetic resonance imaging , kanwisher and coworkers  <cit>  found an area in the fusiform gyrus that was significantly more active when the subjects viewed faces than when they viewed assorted common objects. the authors concluded that this area, hereafter called the fusiform face area , might be specifically involved in the perception of faces, not ruling out that other structures might be play a role in this process.

indeed, haxby et al.  provided evidence that face perception involves a distributed and hierarchically organized network of the occipito-temporal regions. in this model, the core system consists of the extrastriate visual cortex , which mediates the analysis of face structure, while the superior temporal sulcus  mediates the analysis of changeable aspects of the face, such as eye gaze, facial expression, and lip movements.

interestingly, the kanwisher et al. study  <cit>  showed an activation of ffa only in the right hemisphere in about half the subjects , whereas the other subjects showed bilateral activation. these results raised the possibility of functional hemispheric asymmetry in the ffa. studies addressing this possibility have provided conflicting evidence: several human  <cit>  and animal studies  <cit>  found stronger activity in the right hemisphere, while other studies failed to support the notion of a strict right-lateralization .

closer examination of several studies offers more details, but no consensus, on hemispheric asymmetry in areas devoted to face processing. yovel and kanwisher  <cit>  found significantly higher fmri responses to faces than to objects in both the left and right mid-fusiform gyrus regions, although this effect was slightly greater in the right than the left ffa. in another fmri study  <cit> , a region that responded more strongly to faces than to objects was found within the right fusiform gyrus in  <dig> subjects ; however, in  <dig> of these subjects the same significant pattern was also found in the left fusiform gyrus. recently, pourtois and coworkers  <cit>  performed an fmri study on face identity processing on a group of  <dig> men and  <dig> women. results revealed a reduced response in the lateral occipital and fusiform cortex with face repetition. specifically, view-sensitive repetition effects were found in both the left and right fusiform cortices, while the left  fusiform cortex showed viewpoint-independent repetition effects. these findings were interpreted as a sign of left hemisphere dominance in terms of the ability to link visual facial appearance with specific identity knowledge. in line with this, a case has been reported of hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces after left lateral temporo-occipital damage in a female patient  <cit> , suggesting a possible role of the left hemisphere in identity processing. again, a recent fmri study  <cit>  carried out on  <dig> women and  <dig> men provided evidence of a significant activation of right fusiform and occipital gyrus , left fusiform gyrus, left inferior, and middle temporal gyrus  for a face familiarity effect during gender classification, thus providing a complex lateralization pattern for processing face structures and properties.

event-related potential  and magnetoencephalography  recordings of brain activity have provided crucial information about the temporal unfolding of neural mechanisms involved in face processing . in particular, these recordings have identified a posterior-lateral negative peak at a latency of approximately  <dig> ms . this peak has a larger amplitude in response to faces than to other control stimuli , and is sensitive to face inversion . n <dig> is thought to reflect processes involved in the structural encoding of faces. in addition, several studies have found that affective information modulates brain response to human faces as early as 120â€“ <dig> ms  <cit> . the combination of electromagnetic and functional neuroimaging data identified the possible generator of n <dig> in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex   <cit> , suggesting that n <dig> might be the electromagnetic manifestation of a face-processing area activity. an analysis of the relevant literature shows that the topographic distribution of the face-specific n <dig> is not always right-sided in right-handed individuals. based on a thorough review of methods and subject samples used in the relevant literature , we hypothesized that this topographic distribution might depend on marked inter-individual differences, possibly related to viewer gender.

it is of great interest to note that face-specific n <dig> responses were found to be bilateral or even left-sided in studies involving a sample in which women were the majority  <cit> . equally interesting, in a recent paper on prosopagnosia in which both male and female patients were considered  <cit> ,  <dig> out of the  <dig> male patients showed an m <dig> response which was not sensitive to faces  while the third patient showed a right-sided sensitivity to faces. as for the two female patients, one of them showed a lack of sensitivity to faces at m <dig> level, while the second one showed a left-sided sensitivity.

many face processing studies using meg, erp, neuroimaging, or neuropsychological data do not take subject gender into account as a variable that might affect asymmetry in brain activation. the specific goal of this study was to investigate the timing and topography of brain activity in men and women during processing of neutral and affective faces in order to detect whether there are gender differences in lateralization. to address this question, early face-sensitive p <dig> and n <dig> responses over the occipital/temporal cortices to neutral and affective expressions were measured in strictly right-handed men and women.

RESULTS
behavioral data
a repeated-measures anova was performed on mean response times , but showed no significant gender effect on response speed . men and women subjects also did not significantly differ in accuracy; however, error percentages were too few to be statistically analyzed. the emotional valence of faces affected rts , which were faster to negative expressions  than to neutral expressions  for all viewers.

latency
overall, p <dig> was earlier in response to distressed  vs. neutral faces , as shown by the significant "emotion" factor . the analysis of p <dig> latency values also showed a strong "gender" effect  with earlier p <dig> responses in women  than men , as shown in fig.  <dig> 

the anova performed on n <dig> latency values showed that responses to both neutral and distressed faces were significantly faster in women  than men  as shown by the significant "gender" factor . furthermore, the effect of "hemisphere x gender"  proved a strong hemispheric asymmetry in men but not in women; men responded earlier in the right hemisphere rather than the left , as confirmed by tukey post-hoc comparisons.

amplitude
the p <dig> response was much larger in amplitude in women  than men  as confirmed by the "gender" factor , regardless of facial expression. the p <dig> response reached its maximum amplitude over the right occipital cortex in both genders  and was not sensitive to the affective content of the images. these effects are clearly visible in the erp waveforms displayed in fig.  <dig> 

the emotional content of facial expressions significantly affected n <dig> amplitudes, as proved by the significance of "emotion" factor  indicating larger n <dig> responses to distressed faces  than to neutral faces .

the n <dig> response was differently lateralized in men and women. overall , women exhibited a n <dig> response of comparable amplitude over the two visual areas , whereas n <dig> was significantly lateralized over the right hemisphere in men  as demonstrated by the significant interaction of "gender x hemisphere" . this suggests a functional characterization of the hemispheric lateralization in men, which would be more related to the analysis of structural properties of faces and expressions rather than to their affective content.

discussion
the p <dig> response was larger and earlier in women than in men, probably suggesting a female preference for the visual signal . this hypothesis is supported by a recent fmri study showing a stronger activation of the fusiform gyrus in women  in response to children's faces  <cit> . in our study, both p <dig> and n <dig> were affected by the emotional content of faces, being earlier  and larger  in response to distressed faces as opposed to neutral faces. these data fit with the available literature which supports the notion of early effects of emotional  <cit>  and attentional factors  <cit>  in the first stages of visual cortical processing. overall, the p <dig> component was larger over the right occipital area in all individuals, and to all stimuli, as clearly visible from the topographic maps in fig.  <dig> 

this effect might be due either to sensory or cognitive factors. since all stimuli were faces, in this experiment the asymmetry cannot be ascribed to a generic effect of face processing. indeed, the literature on face recognition does not support the evidence of a right lateralization for the p <dig> response, but, rather, a bilateral distribution is often reported . furthermore, in studies involving visual-spatial or selective attention tasks, the p <dig> component is often described as larger at the right than the left occipital lateral sites both for space orienting  and processing of global configurations . in addition, p <dig> is always right-lateralized in response to low spatial frequency patterns even in passive viewing conditions  <cit> . for these reasons, we cannot discuss the p <dig> right lateralization as an index of a hemispheric dominance for face processing.

on the other hand, the face-specific n <dig> component was clearly lateralized differently in the men and women in our study. indeed, a strong gender effect in the hemispheric lateralization of n <dig> component was observed, both in the latency and amplitude of cerebral response. this hemispheric asymmetry in men was not restricted to the processing of affective faces, and was significant in response to both neutral and distressed faces . thus, a right hemispheric dominance is suggested for face processing in men but not in women. this may explain the many inconsistencies present in the relevant erp and neuroimaging literature, which sometimes predicts a bilateral effect and other times a strong right-sided activity in regions devoted to face processing. these conclusions often rely on a mixed gender population, in which men and women are not necessarily equally represented .

our results are also in line with many studies that show gender differences in the degree of lateralization of cognitive and affective processes. considerable data support greater hemispheric lateralization in men than women for linguistic tasks  <cit>  and for spatial tasks  <cit> . gender differences have also been found in the lateralization of visual-spatial processes such as mental rotation  <cit>  and object construction tasks  <cit> , in which males are typically right hemisphere  dominant and females bilaterally distributed. more relevant to the present experiment are the data provided by bourne  <cit> , who examined the lateralization of processing positive facial emotion in a group of  <dig> right-handed individuals . subjects were asked to observe a series of chimeric faces formed with one half showing a neutral expression and the other half showing a positive expression in the left or right visual field, and to decide which face they thought looked happier. the results showed that males were more strongly lateralized than women in the perception of facial expressions, showing a stronger perceptual asymmetry in favour of the left visual field. there are also a number of studies that have found different degrees of lateralization in the cerebral response of men and women to emotional stimuli  <cit> : men tend to demonstrate an asymmetric functioning, and women a bilateral functioning  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study found a lesser degree of lateralization of brain functions related to face and expression processing in women than men. furthermore, these results emphasize the importance of considering gender as a factor in the study of brain lateralization during face processing. in this light, our data may also provide an explanation of the inconsistencies in the available literature concerning the asymmetric activity of left and right occipito-temporal cortices devoted to face perception during processing of face identity, structure, familiarity or affective content.
