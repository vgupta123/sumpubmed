BACKGROUND
fusarium oxysporum schltdl.:fr. is an anamorphic fungal soil-borne facultative parasite present in soil and on organic substrates worldwide. the species includes non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains, the latter causing vascular wilt and root rot on many economically important crops. pathogenic f. oxysporum strains have been subdivided into over  <dig> different host-specific forms  which are morphologically indistinguishable and represent intra-specific groups of strains with similar or identical host range  <cit> . the identification of pathogenic f. oxysporum isolates is traditionally based on pathogenicity testing, which is time consuming and laborious. a forma specialis can be further subdivided into races on the basis of characteristic virulence patterns on differential host cultivars  <cit> .

among the eight formae speciales that attack cucurbits, only f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis snyder & hans.  is specific to melon  and it is responsible for the most important infectious disease in this fruit species  <cit> . four races of the pathogen  have been defined according to the host resistance genes overcome by variants of the pathogen  <cit> . race  <dig>  is further subdivided into race  <dig>  y, which causes yellowing, and race <dig>  w, which causes wilting. race  <dig> induces disease on melon genotypes that lack fom resistance genes. two dominant, independently-inherited resistance  genes  provide resistance to races  <dig> and  <dig>  and races  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the presence of both genes confers high resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . another gene, fom- <dig>  has been reported to confer resistance to races  <dig> and  <dig> in cultivar perlita fr, but there are conflicting data suggesting allelism with fom- <dig>  <cit> . resistance to race  <dig>  is complex and appears to be controlled by multiple recessive genes. partial resistance was found in several far-eastern lines such as ogon  <dig>  and was introgressed into the cultivar 'isabelle'  <cit>  from which the two doubled-haploid resistant lines nad- <dig> and nad- <dig> were derived  <cit> . perchepied and pitrat  <cit>  estimated that 4- <dig> genes were involved in resistance against fom race  <dig> , confirming its polygenic nature. qtl analysis revealed nine loci linked to this trait in melon  <cit> . more recently, herman and perl-treves  <cit>  found that two complementary recessive genes in the genotype biz are required to confer full resistance to race  <dig> . furthermore, a major recessive qtl for resistance was located and linked to a locus controlling fruit netting  <cit> .

wilting symptoms and plant death caused by fom  can be devastating, with losses as high as 100%  <cit> . once introduced into the field, fom can persist even after rotation with non-host crops, due to the production of chlamydospores  and its ability to colonize crop residues and roots of most crops grown in rotation  <cit> . effective control can be achieved only through host resistance. although many fusarium species can penetrate into the cortical tissue of roots, only host-specific strains can penetrate the vascular elements by mycelial growth and the formation of microconidia, transported in the sap stream  <cit> . unfortunately, molecular discrimination of f. oxysporum isolates is seriously complicated by the polyphyletic nature of many formae speciales, and isolates belonging to different formae speciales may be more related than isolates belonging to the same forma specialis  <cit> . ideally, it would be possible to distinguish f. oxysporum strains based on dna sequences directly related to  pathogenicity or non-pathogenicity  <cit> .

penetration of host roots is an active process, although it may be accelerated by wounding. the progress of the infection for xylem-colonizing f. oxysporum strains has been documented in studies using green fluorescent protein  as a marker, mainly in melon  <cit>  but also in arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . wilting is the outcome of a combination of regulated host-pathogen activities beginning with recognition of the host root, followed by differentiation and attachment of an appressorium-like structure, penetration of root cortex to access the vascular tissue, adaptation to the hostile plant environment, hyphal proliferation and production of microconidia within the xylem vessels, and finally the secretion of small molecules such as peptides or toxins  <cit> . the host responds with molecular defenses and with the production of defence structures including gels, gums, and tyloses, and vessels crashing by proliferation of adjacent parenchyma cells  <cit> . understanding the molecular aspects of the infection process could shed light on the mechanisms and genes involved in the signal cascades associated with resistance and susceptibility. the response to f. oxysporum, as a vascular pathogen, has predominantly been characterized in the host/pathogen binomial tomato/f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici which has become a model system for the molecular basis of disease resistance and susceptibility  <cit> . some resistance mechanisms have been determined by gene silencing or insertional mutagenesis  <cit> . understanding susceptibility/resistance in melon would facilitate the development of new control strategies and the identification of pathogen and host factors required for resistance responses and/or disease progression.

changes in host and pathogen steady state mrna levels during a fungal infection can provide a valuable readout of the molecular processes underlying resistance and susceptibility  <cit> . dna microarrays are traditionally the standard tool for genome-wide expression analysis, although next-generation sequencing technologies are emerging as a robust alternative, but in both cases large collections of known transcript sequences must already be available  <cit> . in contrast, cdna-aflp remains the method of choice where the focus is gene discovery, particularly when dealing with plant-microbe interactions and seeking to identify transcripts from both interacting partners  <cit> .

here we describe the identification of differentially expressed transcripts in the binomial interaction between melon and fom. the cultivar charentais fom- <dig> was chosen as the host genotype since it is susceptible to fom race  <dig>  but resistant to race  <dig>  thus providing the opportunity to investigate both compatible and an incompatible interactions in the same genetic background. we infected plants with fom strain ispave <dig>  and strains ispave <dig> and ispave <dig> . the race  <dig>  w strains are both highly virulent, but only ispave <dig> commonly induces necrosis at the collar level. these strains were chosen to identify possible differences in gene expression between isolates differing in their aggressiveness. host colonization in stems was assessed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post inoculation , and the fungal strains were reisolated from infected plants. we observed markedly different colonization patterns when comparing compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations. five time points  from the symptomless early stage  to obvious wilting symptoms  were considered for cdna-aflp analysis to identify both early signaling events occurring in the plant, and plant or fungal genes possibly involved in symptom development. because of the increase in fungal mass at late time points, the analysis was expected to identify a large number of fungal transcripts expressed in planta, particularly at  <dig> dpi, when wilting symptoms in the compatible interaction are obvious. rna from colonies of the three strains grown in vitro was also included in the analysis to help detect fom transcripts specifically expressed in planta and to identify transcript-derived fragments  that are differentially expressed among races/strains.

RESULTS
melon colonization by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis races  <dig> and  <dig> 
the frequency of reisolations along the stem of inoculated melon plants at eight time points  is shown for the three strains of fom in figure  <dig>  both race  <dig> and race  <dig>  were recovered from the stems of inoculated plants, irrespective of the compatibility of the host-pathogen combination, but the strains differed in the speed and extent of colonization. avirulent strain ispave <dig>  achieved a more rapid and continuous colonization of the stem compared to strains ispave <dig> and ispave <dig>  at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. however, by  <dig> dpi, the highest stem level from which the fungus could be recovered was no longer dependent on the race. all strains reached a height of  <dig> mm, although ispave <dig> did so with the greatest frequency. by  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, when symptoms of the virulent strains were obvious on all plants, both race  <dig>  strains could be reisolated all along the stems, although ispave <dig> was faster and more continuous than ispave <dig>  conversely, the avirulent strain was never recovered from the highest section of the stems  from  <dig> dpi and onwards. a continuity index was established for each plant by considering the presence  or absence  of the fungus in adjacent pairs of stem sections. generally, the distribution of fungus along the stem was discontinuous at the early time points, although more continuity was shown by race  <dig> . a peculiar pattern was shown at  <dig> dpi because the highest section allowing successful reisolation was lower than at 1- <dig> dpi , and the pathogen distribution was still discontinuous for all races . from  <dig> dpi onwards, colonization along the stem differed significantly between the virulent and avirulent strains, and the more extensive colonization shown by the race  <dig>  strains was coupled with the appearance of obvious symptoms. in the late phase , continuous distribution was observed for all three strains, but for race-specific reasons . both virulent strains were continuously distributed along the entire stem length, whereas the avirulent strain was continuously absent from the highest section of the stem, and continuously present in the lower sections . plants inoculated with race  <dig> remained symptomless until the end of the experiment, although the pathogen could still be reisolated. the fungus was never reisolated from uninoculated plants. all three strains could be reisolated from the stem base regardless of the time point.

cdna-aflp analysis
we carried out a cdna-aflp analysis on rna samples from both healthy and infected melon plants to identify differentially-expressed transcripts putatively associated with the infection process and resistance response. rna samples from the three fungal strains grown in vitro were also included in the analysis, first to help identify fungal transcripts expressed specifically in planta and second to identify fungal genes differentially expressed in vitro among the three strains. because the fungus could be reisolated from infected stems starting from  <dig> dpi in all interactions , samples of infected plants were collected for cdna-aflp analysis at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. these time points were intended to take into account the early stages of infection, but also to allow the detection of pathogen transcripts when infection was well established and the mycelia produced at the late stage were abundant. rna was also collected from uninfected plants as a control. the expression patterns of approximately  <dig> transcripts were monitored with  <dig> different bstyi +1/msei + <dig> primer combinations for selective amplification. for each primer combination, 55- <dig> transcript derived fragments  were visualized as bands, varying in size from  <dig> to ~ <dig> bp. the same average number of bands per lane was obtained from both melon and fom colony samples .

detection of differentially expressed transcripts in planta
all bands were scored visually, and only those showing a 2-fold or more difference in intensity compared to uninfected controls were selected for further analysis. all bands were assigned a positive or negative score from - <dig> to  <dig> considering as zero the intensity of the corresponding band in the control lane . we detected a total of  <dig> differentially-expressed tdfs.

the same scores were used to cluster profiles of differentially-expressed tdfs derived from infected melon stems. as shown in figure 3a, fom infection increased the abundance of a large number of mrnas, especially in stems infected by the two race  <dig>  strains at the very late phase , with a similar pattern of transcriptional changes. more limited changes were observed at the other time points, and also in the incompatible interaction with race  <dig> 

a total of  <dig> bands with differential expression profiles in comparison to uninfected samples in at least one interaction were excised from the gels, eluted, and re-amplified with the appropriate cdna-aflp primers. direct sequencing of  <dig> cdna fragments yielded  <dig> products that could be used to screen public databases for homologous sequences, considering as significant alignments with an e < 10- <dig> 

from the blast analysis,  <dig> sequences were identified as melon transcripts . among those,  <dig> were found to be similar to expressed melon sequences in the vs  <dig>  melon unigene database http://www.icugi.org <cit>  and  <dig> tdfs were homologous to known plant sequences in the uniprot  <cit>  or ncbi  <cit>  databases and were therefore also considered to be derived from melon. we decided another  <dig> sequences with no database matches were also derived from melon because a band of identical size was present in the uninfected melon sample. a total of  <dig> tdfs were found to be homologous to known fusarium spp. sequences and were classed as fom genes expressed in planta during the infection process . most of these  were derived from bands detected in samples infected with the virulent race  <dig>  strains at  <dig> dpi, when the fungus had already extensively colonized the stem.

another  <dig> fragments with no matches could not be assigned to either the plant or the fungus and therefore were considered as orphan tdfs. because most of the orphan tdfs were identified at the final time point, and only in the compatible interactions, many of them are likely to represent additional fungal transcripts that currently lack functional annotations.

expression patterns and clustering of melon tdfs
a numerical overview of the differences between incompatible and compatible interactions showing the total number of differentially-expressed melon genes at each time point and in each interaction is provided in figure  <dig>  at  <dig> dpi, it is clear that the response to both race  <dig> and race <dig>  involves the same number of genes in all interactions, but differences emerge between the races at later time points. in the incompatible interaction, the number of modulated genes stabilizes at ~ <dig>  with a core of  <dig> genes that remain modulated in a coherent way  until the end of the experiment . conversely, in the compatible interactions, the number of modulated genes increases similarly for both strains, with a peak of induction at  <dig> dpi.

to further characterize host plant responses towards the two races, we clustered the  <dig> modulated melon genes in four groups corresponding to: a)  <dig> melon sequences modulated solely during the incompatible interaction ; b)  <dig> melon sequences differentially modulated specifically in the compatible interactions at all time points in the experiment; c)  <dig> melon sequences modulated specifically in the compatible interactions and only at late time points ; and d)  <dig> melon sequences repressed or induced at different stages in both the compatible and incompatible interactions . these groups correspond to the clusters shown in figure 3b. tdfs from each cluster, selected on the basis of their putative role in plant-microbe interactions, are considered in the discussion and listed in table  <dig> 

this selection of representative genes modulated by infection with avirulent  or virulent  strains of fom is divided into clusters as defined in the results section. identification numbers  correspond to progressive numbering of bands in the gels. the primer combination used to visualize each band  and the corresponding length of the fragment are reported, along with the accession number in the database from which the sequence was retrieved, its annotation, the corresponding blast score and the functional category to which each transcript was assigned. in addition, the table shows the expression profile of each transcript, in each interaction and at each time point, estimated on the basis of the band intensity with a score from - <dig> to  <dig>  in comparison to the corresponding band in the uninfected controls.

the number of transcripts in each cluster indicates there is little specificity in the response to compatible and incompatible interactions, since few genes are modulated solely in one type of interaction . the data also reveal a broad response to the virulent race  <dig>  strains, specific for compatibility at late time points, and that most transcripts show variable modulation over time in either of the interactions.

the clusters also show considerable differences in the pattern of transcriptional changes. in cluster c, almost all of the transcripts are induced. only nine of the  <dig> transcripts are repressed, with perfect correspondence between the infection patterns of the race  <dig>  strains. cluster d includes variably expressed transcripts representing infections with either of the races. most of the melon tdfs in this cluster increase or decrease coherently, in both compatible and incompatible interactions, with a small number of exceptions. examples include an aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase, a gibberellin oxidase, a protein translocase sec <dig> complex gamma subunit and an aux1-like protein, which are induced in the incompatible interaction and repressed in the compatible interactions. in contrast, a catalase isozyme  <dig>  an acc oxidase, a hmg-coa reductase and a trehalase  <dig> show the opposite behavior.

functional categories of melon transcripts modulated by fusarium infection
each transcript was functionally annotated through a careful analysis of the scientific literature and with the aid of the gene ontology database  <cit> http://www.geneontology.org. an overview of functional categories affected by fom infection appears more informative when each cluster is considered separately. because cluster a and b contain very few genes, no diagram is provided.

cluster a contains  <dig> sequences, six of which have putative annotations. among them are transcripts corresponding to a catalase involved in the response against oxidative stress and a putative calmodulin-related protein involved in signal transduction. cluster b contains only three sequences including a transmembrane clptm <dig> family protein, which is also induced in response to bacterial infection  <cit>  and was identified as a possible downstream target of the heat shock regulator hsfa1a  <cit> , and a putative pyridoxal biosynthesis protein pdx <dig> , which is essential for vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis and has been correlated to stress tolerance and photoprotection in arabidopsis  <cit> .

identification of f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis genes expressed in melon during infection
fom genomic sequence data are scarce, so we expanded the search to include sequences from other fusarium species or f. oxysporum formae speciales available in public databases. a total of  <dig> tdfs expressed in planta during the infection were identified as homologous to sequences assigned to f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, f. graminearum or f. verticilloides . among these transcripts,  <dig> generated similar-sized bands in the cdna-aflp lanes of the fungal strains grown in vitro, while the remaining  <dig> fragments corresponded to transcripts that were not detected in fungal colonies but only in planta during the infection and may therefore represent factors related to virulence . as expected, pathogen transcripts were detected predominantly during the late infection phase and almost exclusively in the compatible interaction, probably due to the higher fungal biomass produced in host tissues. selected fom transcripts detected in planta are listed in table  <dig> 

selected fom transcripts identified in infected melon plants, either specifically in planta, or both in planta and in vitro. identification numbers  correspond to progressive numbering of bands in the gels. the primer combination used to visualize each band  and the corresponding length of the fragment are reported, along with the accession number in the database from which the sequence was retrieved, its annotation, the corresponding blast score and the functional category to which each transcript was assigned. in addition, the table reports the expression profile of each transcript, in each interaction and at each time point, estimated according to band intensity with a score from  <dig> to  <dig> 

fungal genes expressed only in planta  or in planta and in vitro  were also assigned functional categories based on careful literature evaluation. this allowed us to identify some interesting differences, namely in the "cell component" and in the "virulence" categories, which are represented more in planta than in vitro. other categories show similar percentages in both groups.

detection of fungal transcripts differentially expressed among strains grown in vitro
we identified  <dig> bands that were differentially expressed among the three fom strains grown in vitro,  <dig> of which were expressed uniquely in vitro and were selected for amplification and sequencing. for the remaining  <dig> tdfs, similar sized bands were also present in planta and in most cases the corresponding cdnas had already been excised from the infected melon lanes . of the  <dig> tdfs expressed only in vitro,  <dig> were specifically expressed by strain ispave <dig> , and  <dig>  were specifically expressed by the two strains of race  <dig>  . searching the fusarium database  <cit>  revealed sequences similar to at least one fusarium gene for  <dig> fragments,  <dig> of which were annotated. another  <dig> sequences did not match any public sequences and could represent novel f. oxysporum genes with a putative role in virulence.

validation of representative genes by real-time rt-pcr
the expression profiles of seven modulated melon transcripts were analyzed by real-time rt-pcr to validate cdna-aflp data . genes were chosen among those expressed in planta as representative of the different clusters, with a preference for defense-related genes. the rt-pcr expression profiles of six genes agreed strongly with the cdna-aflp data, whereas the protein translocase sec <dig> complex gamma subunit appeared to be induced to a significantly greater extent according to the rt-pcr results. the identity and expression of five fungal tdfs expressed in planta was confirmed using the same technique . minor discrepancies are observed when expression levels are measured using different techniques  <cit>  but the rt-pcr and cdna-aflp data are largely concordant, confirming the reliability of the results.

seven melon transcripts, differentially expressed following fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis  infection according to cdna-aflp experiments, were selected for validation by real time rt-pcr. each gene was validated at the same time point and with the same fom strain that generated a differential cdna-aflp profile. the fom strains are ispave <dig> race <dig> and ispave <dig> race  <dig> . results are shown as fold change values in infected samples in comparison to mock-inoculated controls and are the average of three technical replicates. i/r: induced or repressed according to cdna-aflp experiments. sd: standard deviation.

five fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis transcripts, expressed in planta during infection according to cdna-aflp experiments, were selected for validation by real time rt-pcr. data are shown as the difference between the ct of the gene analyzed and the ct of melon actin , used as a normalizer.

discussion
melon is an important horticultural crop and is rapidly becoming a popular research model for cucurbits, thanks to the increasing availability of genomic resources. several diseases affect melon production, but molecular investigations of plant-pathogen interactions in melon are still rare  <cit> . recently, a melon array resource has been developed, allowing the transcriptomic analysis of several physiological and pathological conditions  <cit> . however, the melon genome has not been fully sequenced, so alternative transcriptomic approaches allowing novel gene discovery are still important. the cdna-aflp method is particularly appropriate for gene expression studies in non-model species and it also allows identification of both plant and pathogen genes expressed during infection, an important pre-requisite for the identification of pathogenicity and virulence factors and thus for the identification of targeted control strategies  <cit> . our study provides the first large-scale investigation of gene expression changes that occur when melon is infected with fom, the most important melon pathogen, and is the first to compare compatible and incompatible interactions in the same genetic background .

analysis of f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis colonization in melon stems
because few researchers have investigated fom infections in melon, the site and timing of recognition is currently unknown, which makes difficult to propose suitable time points for molecular analysis. we therefore began this investigation by characterizing the infection process in melon plants inoculated with avirulent fom race  <dig> and virulent race  <dig> . disease progression was monitored using the same approach  that has been successful in tomato  <cit> . colonization followed a similar trend to that reported for f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici in tomato  <cit> , i.e. the fungus distribution was discontinuous in all combinations from 2- <dig> dpi, then continuous from 14- <dig> dpi with distinct patterns in the incompatible and compatible combinations. from  <dig> dpi onwards, symptoms became obvious in the compatible interaction as generally reported in the literature  <cit> . whereas the two virulent strains fully colonize the stem, colonization by the avirulent strain is reduced, and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi the height reached in stems is significantly lower than that reached at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. these findings suggest that the plant may attack the invading pathogen and reduce its vitality. the data were confirmed by real-time pcr, indicating a progressive reduction in the amount of fungus present at later time points in the incompatible interaction . di pietro and colleagues  <cit>  found that, having reached the xylem, the fungus remains exclusively within the vessels using them to colonize the host rapidly, mainly through the production of microconidia rather than mycelia which, in turn, progressively grows inside the xylem inducing vessel clogging. in contrast to this prominent microconidia model  <cit> , studies using gfp-labeled f. oxysporum have shown that neither conidiophores nor microconidia are found in arabidopsis or tomato xylem  <cit> . the response to infection may be affected by inoculum concentration, the age of the plant, the duration of exposure to the inoculum, and the type of substrate for plant growth   <cit> . the assessment time points may also play an important role in the picture that emerges of the host/pathogen genetic responses. nevertheless, differences in the infection process are likely to occur among different formae speciales and between different experimental designs.

genetic elements of host colonization and pathogenicity
most transcriptomics studies involving f. oxysporum have focused on the interactions that occur in the xylem, and these studies suggest that the main resistance responses occur within or along the vessels. in this context, genes that are expressed solely in planta and not in artificial culture are the most interesting because they are likely virulence factors . we identified  <dig> genes that were expressed in planta,  <dig> of which  were not expressed under artificial culture conditions and therefore represent putative virulence factors. interestingly, only  <dig> out of  <dig> genes in cotton plants infected with f. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum were expressed specifically in planta  <cit> . the group of putative virulence factors identified in our analysis included plant cell wall degrading enzymes , represented by five transcripts encoding pectate lyases, endo- <dig>  beta xylanases and endo- <dig>  beta glucanases, possibly activated by interaction with the host. among these transcripts, an endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase  <dig> precursor is the only sequence peculiar to race  <dig>  induced in the incompatible interaction, while the other four tdfs are specific to the race  <dig>  strains. like most fungi, f. oxysporum secretes cwdes during either penetration or colonization  <cit> . although the inactivation of individual cwde- or protease-encoding genes might not have a detectable impact on virulence , possibly because of functional redundancy, their activity is crucial in the process of fungal colonization. active fungal growth is also documented by the specific in planta expression of several genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, among them a squalene synthase involved in sterol biosynthesis. sterols facilitate normal membrane function by controlling their fluidity, but they have also been implicated as ligands for nuclear receptors directly affecting transcription and signal transduction pathways  <cit> . other examples include genes for cytoskeleton components  and a chitin synthase gene. class v chitin synthase is a pathogenicity determinant in f. oxysporum and a mediator of protection against plant defense compounds  <cit> .

three other in planta-specific tdfs seem particularly important in terms of virulence. these represent genes encoding homologs of an avenacinase, a fumonisin 16p, and a siderophore iron transporter . there is increasing evidence that mycotoxin production may enhance pathogen virulence, especially fumonisins and some trichothecenes  <cit> . fumonisin enhances the ability of f. graminearum to cause wheat head blight, one of the most important wheat diseases in the world  <cit> . it has been reported that mycotoxin production can be induced in fungi following the perception of the oxidative burst produced by the plant in response to infection, and could enhance pathogenicity by reducing the oxidative status of the fungal cell. interestingly, the gene encoding the fungal toxin fumonisin was strongly and specifically expressed in planta only by virulent strains.

avenacina is a hydrolytic enzyme that can degrade the oat saponin avenacine, and was first recognized as an essential pathogenicity factor in the take-all fungus gaeumannomyces graminis var. avenae. saponins, glycosides with soap-like properties that disrupt membranes, are a class of phytoanticipins. the role of saponin detoxification remains controversial in other plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . however, the saponin-degrading tomatinase from f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici has recently been confirmed as a virulence factor in tomato, by targeted disruption and over-expression of the corresponding gene  <cit> . in melon, we found that the avenacinase transcript is not only expressed specifically in planta, but is also differentially expressed between the two  <dig>  strains, with higher levels produced by ispave <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first evidence to support a role for saponin-detoxifying enzymes in fom infection. the siderophore iron transporter mirb gene may also represent a virulence factor because siderophores  are crucial for fungal pathogenicity in both animals and plants, and also maintain plant-fungal symbioses  <cit> . the final group of fom genes expressed only in planta includes several involved in transport and intracellular trafficking, and three related to signal transduction, with similarity to a calnexin involved in calcium-regulated protein folding  <cit> , a phosphoserine phosphatase and a mads box protein.

although expressed both in planta and in vitro, a peroxisomal biogenesis factor pex <dig> and an arginase coding gene are also worth mentioning . peroxisomes are single-membrane-bound organelles which, in filamentous fungi, are involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, peroxide detoxification and the occlusion of septal pores  <cit> . peroxisomal function and fatty acid metabolism are required for fungal virulence. in f. oxysporum, four different pex genes  were identified as potential pathogenicity genes in a recent insertional mutagenesis screen, and the requirement for full pathogenicity was verified for two of them  by complementation with the intact genes  <cit> . arginase regulates the production of nitric oxide , which is induced in a jasmonate-dependent manner in response to wounding and is strongly implicated in the activation of disease resistance genes  <cit> . in microorganisms, arginase activity has been correlated with pathogenicity  <cit>  and was shown to act as a bacterial survival mechanism by downregulating host nitric oxide production  <cit> . other transcripts expressed by fom in planta, specifically or otherwise, are involved in ubiquitinylation and protein degradation, both of which are necessary for pathogenicity in f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici  <cit> , and in different aspects of fungal metabolism.

differentially expressed genes among f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis strains in vitro
one major problem in fom diagnosis is the identification of isolates at the race level. in melon-growing areas, the introduction of races that can overcome resistance in cultivated genotypes may result in dramatic crop losses. at present, no molecular tools are available to replace the time-consuming race-determination tests. we identified a number of transcripts with differential expression profiles between the two races . although differences in gene expression cannot be used directly as genetic markers of race identity, tdfs could be used as 'fingerprints' for this purpose. in addition, the differential virulence of the two  <dig>  strains demonstrated by the host colonization pattern, could also be fingerprinted using tdfs that are differentially expressed between ispave <dig> and ispave <dig>  unfortunately, most tdfs in this category either matched hypothetical protein sequences in public databases or did not generate hits at all, and therefore do not allow speculation about the possible metabolic differences between the two races or between the two strains of fom race  <dig> .

large-scale transcriptional changes underlie disease development
transcriptional changes associated with resistance responses occur within the first  <dig> dpi, and are maintained with few changes thereafter . however, only  <dig> melon transcripts  are specific for the incompatible interaction. the largest group of modulated genes  is expressed in a non-specific manner, with variable modulation throughout the experiment, in both the incompatible and compatible interactions. the establishment of compatibility is characterized by a slightly delayed but progressive increase of the number of genes involved, underlying the significant metabolic disturbances that might be associated with symptom development. the majority of these changes are included in cluster d and are thus non-specific up to  <dig> dpi, but are followed by a sudden wave of susceptibility-specific transcriptional changes at  <dig> dpi, almost completely conserved between the virulent strains ispave <dig> and ispave <dig> 

although the precocity of the resistance response is expected, the small number of genes involved is unexpected. incompatible interactions commonly involve large-scale transcriptional reprogramming toward defense, which is generally more intense and rapid than in corresponding compatible interactions  <cit> . however, vascular diseases may represent a peculiar situation, in which symptom development and consequent damage could depend not only on the pathogenetic activity of the fungus but also the strength and timing of the host response. this was indicated by pioneering research in which delayed formation of tyloses in susceptible genotypes eventually contributes to vessel clogging  <cit> . in agreement with the above, our data suggest that more striking changes in gene expression accompany disease and symptom development than resistance, thus resistance might depend more on the ability to tolerate the infection, avoiding reactions.

transcriptional changes in the compatible interaction
although cluster analysis and functional annotation of the identified melon transcripts provided an overview of the transcriptional changes occurring in infected melon plants, the limited availability of sequence data made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the molecular events occurring in infected plants. of the  <dig> tdfs identified in cluster c,  <dig> did not match any database sequences or matched sequences that have yet to be annotated. the remaining  <dig> tdfs encode well-known components of disease resistance responses and related signal transduction cascades, such as calmodulin and calmodulin-binding proteins, transcription factors, a 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, and a 13s-lipoxygenase involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis  <cit> , and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites acting as antimicrobial compounds, or in a general stress responses, such as xanthine dehydrogenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit> . genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins such as endochitinase, beta- <dig>  glucanase and a type i proteinase inhibitor-like protein were also specifically modulated in the compatible interaction. altogether, transcripts related to the defense, response to stimulus and secondary metabolism categories accounted for ~25% of modulated tdfs in cluster c. these findings further support the hypothesis that a delayed defense response might indeed be responsible for symptom development.

cluster c also contained genes potentially involved in the establishment of susceptibility, such as those related to auxin accumulation. several reports indicate that an increase in auxin levels in the cell can contribute to disease susceptibility  <cit>  and that a similar increase can be induced by pathogens in order to facilitate colonization. tdfs with homology to an indole-3-acetic acid-amino synthetase and to an iaa-type protein q75gk <dig>  <cit>  are specifically induced in the compatible interaction. however, other genes in cluster d that induce auxin signaling  are repressed by both virulent strains, but induced by the avirulent strain at  <dig> dpi. the overall picture is therefore complex and suggests that the compatible interaction mainly involves transcriptional changes that are otherwise typical of effective resistance responses. it is tempting to speculate that the recessive resistance identified in asian accessions might be related to the lack of a plant reaction and thus to better tolerance of the infection process  <cit> .

transcriptional changes in the incompatible interaction
resistance responses are generally characterized by rapid and extensive reprogramming of transcriptional activity, especially in race-specific interactions. however, that resistance of charentais fom- <dig> to fom race  <dig>  although mediated by a single r-type resistance gene, is not complete, since the fungus can always be reisolated from the stem of charentais fom- <dig> plants. in our model system we noted surprisingly few transcriptional changes specifically associated with the incompatible interaction . these included a calmodulin-related protein, stably upregulated from  <dig> dpi onwards, which plays an important role in the transduction of calcium signaling and could be involved in the resistant response  and a catalase that may protect the pathogen from the strong oxidative burst associated with resistance.

additional information about the resistance response could be found by analyzing genes that are modulated in both interactions  but with a peculiar pattern , or those showing a reverse modulation of gene expression in one or the other interactions . an interesting finding is that many of the genes modulated earlier or more strongly during resistance are classified as signal transduction-related genes . these include several transcripts involved in calcium signaling , transcription factors, kinases and a homolog of ndr <dig> . this last gene is induced at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi following infection with race  <dig> and only at  <dig> dpi following infection with race  <dig> . ndr <dig> was originally identified in arabidopsis as a factor required for resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens  <cit>  and it is known to mediate resistance controlled by r genes of the nucleotide binding site leucine rich repeats  class, which is distinct from the toll/interleukin receptor  class  <cit> . fom- <dig> in charentais fom- <dig> plants is indeed a non-tir r gene, although with a peculiar structure that lacks the typical n-terminal coiled-coil domain  <cit> . therefore, it seems plausible that its action might require ndr <dig> 

other genes modulated earlier in the establishment of resistance include two adenosylhomocysteinases, an aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase and a serine carboxypeptidase. an arabidopsis adenosylhomocysteinase encoded by the gene hog <dig>  is required for dna-methylation gene silencing  <cit> . the involvement of rna-silencing machinery in plant innate immunity has recently been demonstrated not only against viruses but also bacterial and fungal pathogens, including verticillium in arabidopsis  <cit> . the same transcript increases in aphid-infested sorghum plants  <cit> . the potential involvement of these candidate genes in charentais fom-2- controlled resistance could be the object of future investigations.

most genes in cluster d are not differentially modulated in the incompatible and compatible interactions. interesting examples include tdfs related to acc oxidases. these enzymes participate in the last step of ethylene biosynthesis and are involved in the response to stress and to pathogens, but are also implicated in senescence, necrosis and disease development. ethylene has been associated with both wilting and resistance against vascular diseases  <cit> . we detected four transcripts with similarity to acc oxidases. these showed variable expression profiles, but there was no difference between compatible and incompatible interactions, which suggests that ethylene might be involved in both susceptibility and resistance. in melon, different acc oxidase genes are induced differentially during development and pathogen infection  <cit> . the same variable modulation has been detected for other transcripts possibly related to jasmonate biosynthesis, such as allene oxide synthase and the 13s-lipoxygenase mentioned above.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data suggest that resistance against fom in melon involves only limited transcriptional changes, and that wilting symptoms could derive, at least partially, from an active plant response.

a small but important collection of fom transcripts were shown to be expressed specifically in planta, and not in the same fungal strains growing in vitro, providing excellent candidate virulence factors which can be investigated further to learn more about the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions in melon. finally, race-specific genes were expressed in fungal colonies in vitro as well as in planta, suggesting they could be developed as markers in molecular race-determination assays that could replace the current laborious inoculation-based methods.
