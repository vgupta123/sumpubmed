BACKGROUND
in highly mobile species that are distributed across continuous habitat, persistent gene flow can stifle genetic differentiation and speciation  <cit> . adult giraffes  weigh in excess of  <dig> kg  <cit> , frequently range over several hundred square km and are capable of long distance movements of 50– <dig> km  <cit> . further, giraffes live in loosely constructed social groups with large home range sizes, ranging from  <dig> km <dig> to  <dig> km <dig>  <cit>  throughout scrub and savannah habitat from the sahel to south africa . these life history attributes would predict that low levels of differentiation should be found among populations because the extent of gene flow is related to the dispersal potential of individuals  <cit> . consistent with this prediction, large-bodied mammals such as the african elephant  and african buffalo  generally have low levels of differentiation between adjacent populations  <cit> . however, giraffes exhibit a marked pattern of geographic variation in pelage coloration  as well as in ossicone number  <cit>  and mitochondrial variation  <cit>  suggesting significant population differentiation despite the potential for high rates of genetic exchange.

within the last century, numerous taxonomic schemes have been developed to reflect the regional differences in pelage pattern and morphology. these schemes have ranged from the recognition of two species, g. reticulata and g. camelopardalis and  <dig> subspecies for the latter  <cit> , to the recognition of a single species , with nine  <cit> , eight  <cit> , six  <cit>  or five  <cit>  subspecies . the controversy regarding giraffe subspecies in part reflects high variability in pelage patterns within some populations  <cit>  and suspected hybridization among putative subspecies  <cit> . nonetheless, the boundaries between pelage types and the subspecies they represent can be abrupt and do not necessarily correspond to apparent habitat or topographic obstacles to dispersal. for example, in kenya, masai , reticulated , and rothschild's giraffes  have geographic boundaries in continuous acacia scrub woodland habitat  <cit> . the marked geographic differences in characters such as pelage pattern  suggest reproductive isolation despite the potential for genetic exchange, yet to date, no comprehensive genetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial dna markers have been conducted to evaluate this hypothesis.

 <dig> includes g. c. antiquorum + g. c. congoensis + g. c. peralta.

 <dig> includes g. c. camelopardalis + g. c. rothschildi.

 <dig> includes g. c. angolensis + g. c. capensis + g. c. giraffa + g. c. infumata + g. c. wardi.

in this study, we present a phylogeographic and population genetic analysis of the giraffe across most of the species' remaining geographic range. we sampled free-ranging giraffes representing six of the nine subspecies defined by dagg and foster  <cit>  who used specific morphologic criteria and recognized five distinct pelage patterns . we assessed genetic variation in mitochondrial dna  sequences and  <dig> nuclear microsatellite loci. we found concordant patterns of genetic subdivision in morphology and genetics coincident with subspecies boundaries and a fine scale pattern of genetic subdivision within putative subspecies. such striking genetic partitioning within a highly mobile species is surprising, and implies environmental and behavioral mechanisms limit gene flow between populations. our results have important conservation implications, as some of these genetically distinct populations clearly represent evolutionarily significant units  that are highly threatened and lack appropriate recognition in current management plans.

RESULTS
analysis of the mitochondrial dna sequences
we amplified and sequenced a 654-nucleotide  fragment of mtdna that spanned a region near the 3' end of the cytochrome b  gene to the end of hypervariable region  <dig> of the control region in  <dig> giraffes from  <dig> localities  and one okapi . we detected  <dig> haplotypes that differed by 1– <dig> substitutions . to ensure phylogenetic resolution and robust support for relationships among haplotypes, the remaining portion of the cytb gene was amplified and sequenced from  <dig> giraffes, representing each of the  <dig> unique haplotypes, and the okapi . phylogenetic analysis of these  <dig> sequences revealed the existence of seven primary clades that are well supported with bootstrap values generally over 90%. moreover, these clades are largely consistent with pelage patterns and putative subspecific designations . first, we found two west african haplotypes defined a cluster that is sister to a clade of three haplotypes belonging to the rothschild's giraffes. this clade of west african and rothschild's giraffe haplotypes is also supported by a synapomorphic single nucleotide insertion  in the control region. these two clades are reciprocally monophyletic to a clade defined by the majority of haplotypes from the reticulated giraffe. a fourth and fifth clade are defined by masai giraffe haplotypes east and west of the rift valley in kenya. the masai clade east of the rift valley is sister to a south african giraffe grouping defined by two haplotypes. finally, a seventh clade is defined solely by angolan giraffe haplotypes, which all share a synapomorphic t insertion at position  <dig>  of the control region. the seven clades are grouped into two or three larger clades, depending on the method of rooting , although relationships among these larger clades was not well resolved. notably, midpoint rooting, which places the root at the midpoint between the most divergent lineages , divided giraffes into a northern group containing western, rothschild's and reticulated giraffes and a southern group containing masai, angolan and south african giraffes .

two haplotypes were paraphyletic with respect to their subspecies . one highly divergent haplotype was found in a single reticulated giraffe and formed a sister lineage to the clade containing west african, rothschild's, and all other reticulated giraffe haplotypes. a second haplotype was found in nine masai giraffes and clustered with the reticulated giraffe haplotypes. these isolated cases of paraphyly likely represent ancient introgression events  <cit>  or incomplete lineage sorting of variants rather than recent gene flow given the congruence between subspecies and nuclear dna data patterns .

divergence times between the seven clades obtained from coalescence analysis  <cit>  ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  million years  between masai and south african clades, to  <dig> – <dig>  my between the southern clade  and the northern clade  . values for the northern giraffe grouping were intermediate, with west african and rothschild's giraffes diverging about  <dig> – <dig>  my ago, and the two splitting from reticulated giraffes about  <dig> – <dig>  my ago. these dates argue for a mid to late pleistocene radiation of giraffes.

hierarchical analysis of molecular variance  <cit>  based only on the mtdna control region data  corroborates the phylogenetic results . groupings according to the six subspecies resulted in substantially higher values of genetic variance partitioned among groups  than alternative groupings, corresponding to the deeper clades . haplotype  and nucleotide  diversity of giraffe control region sequences were generally low except for masai and reticulated giraffes, which had values an order of magnitude greater than other groups . the higher mtdna diversity in both masai and reticulated giraffes and the central placement of their haplotypes in the minimum-spanning network  suggest that east africa could represent the geographic origin of giraffes, consistent with the fact that the earliest fossil remains of giraffa camelopardalis have been recovered in east africa  <cit> .

analysis of microsatellite loci
genetic structure was also inferred for  <dig> individuals from  <dig> localities  using  <dig> unlinked microsatellite loci  <cit>  all in hardy-weinberg equilibrium . giraffe genotypes were strongly clustered into subspecific groups based on neighbor-joining analysis of allele-sharing genetic distances . likewise, bayesian clustering analysis of multilocus genotypes using structure  <cit>  resolved all six groups and, in addition, revealed striking subdivision at the population level, with  <dig> of the  <dig> sampling localities resolved as distinct genetic clusters at k =  <dig> and in assignment tests . assignment probabilities correctly classified  <dig> of  <dig>  individuals to population of origin . only three individuals were identified as hybrids between adjacent groups . allele frequency differentiation of groups, as measured by fst, was significant for all pairwise comparisons  and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . these results suggest low levels of gene flow among groups. bayesian inference of migration rates using microsatellite data suggests migration rates are less than  <dig> % per generation between the six subspecific groups . the fst values among giraffe subspecies are comparable to that observed between forest and savannah species of the african elephant  <cit>  and the levels of genetic structure observed within giraffe subspecies  are unprecedented for such a large and highly mobile african mammal.

although hybridization in the wild has been reported for some subspecies , our results show little evidence for genetic exchange between subspecies or the  <dig> genetic units defined by structure . only three potential subspecies hybrids in our sample of  <dig> individuals were identified by assignment tests  and include two rothschild's/reticulated hybrids, and one masai/reticulated hybrid. in fact, neighboring populations often show high levels of differentiation despite being closely situated  and not separated by apparent habitat or topographic boundaries. within subspecies, the three reticulated giraffe localities were all significantly differentiated  even though they range from only  <dig> to  <dig> km distant. genetic differentiation was also significant between four of the masai giraffe sampling locations within serengeti national park  even through they range from only  <dig> to  <dig> km distant. the absence of genetic exchange, even between subspecies sharing a common geographic boundary, suggests they might be reproductively isolated.

discussion
historical causes of diversification
our genetic results reveal the existence of sharp geographic subdivisions in mitochondrial dna sequences and microsatellite allele frequencies, which are concordant with subspecific geographic ranges . estimated divergence times among giraffe clades suggest a mid to late pleistocene diversification of giraffes during a time of intense climatic change in sub-saharan africa  <cit> . specifically, three climate-related factors could have influenced isolation among giraffe populations. first, paleoclimatic evidence indicates increasing aridity and cooler conditions beginning in the late pliocene that likely reduced connectivity between habitats favored by giraffes  <cit> . second, pronounced periodic oscillations of wet and dry conditions driven by changes in the intensity and location of maximal insolation and with a  <dig> year periodicity could have facilitated habitat fragmentation and population isolation  <cit> . third, regional changes in habitat distribution could have promoted the isolation of specific populations, such as the expansion of the mega kalahari desert basin during dry periods of the late pleistocene that might have isolated angolan and south african giraffe populations  <cit> .

if climatic fluctuations caused broad scale changes in vegetation and habitat, leading to population divergence, then the phylogeographical patterns of giraffes should also be found in other species. indeed, western, eastern, and southern african phylogeographic groupings in the giraffe mtdna genealogy are broadly concordant with the genetic patterns observed in other taxa of large african mammals and might correspond to former habitat refuges  <cit> . for example, the phylogeographic patterns in the giraffe are strikingly congruent with those observed in the hartebeest  complex  <cit> . such concordance in phylogeographic patterns among multiple unrelated species suggests histories shaped by similar environmental forces, namely, changes in habitat related to climatic fluctuations  <cit> , in agreement with models of environmentally driven evolution  <cit> .

factors currently maintaining isolation among giraffe populations
past historical factors leading to allopatric divergence could explain broad scale geographic divisions among western, eastern, and southern phylogeographic groupings. however, based on current knowledge of ecological or topographic factors, our results imply that those factors alone cannot explain the reproductive isolation among the parapatric subspecies of giraffes found in east africa . indeed, despite suggestions that hybridization occurs frequently among giraffe subspecies, our microsatellite data suggests that such events are quite rare, occurring in only three of  <dig> sampled individuals . in east africa, one contributing factor to reproductive isolation might be natural selection for a reproductive cycle coincident with the emergence of new browse in contrasting climate regimes. the dry season occurs in july and august in the sahelian zone north of the equator in contrast to december to march to the south  <cit> . giraffes exhibit strong seasonality in births associated with the dry season when, in anticipation of the wetter conditions to follow, a flush of new tree shoots grow, and the protein content of browse is highest  <cit> . rapid growth in juvenile giraffes is advantageous, especially during the first year, when mortality due to predation can range between 50–70%  <cit> . consequently, hybridization between giraffes north and south of the equator could result in offspring born at the inappropriate season and have reduced fitness. additionally, the apparent absence of strong post-mating barriers to reproduction in captivity  <cit>  suggests a role for behavioral isolation in the wild. our finding that pelage and genetic divergence in both maternally and biparentally inherited genetic markers are concordant on a broad geographic scale implicates pelage-based mate preferences as a possible isolating factor. communication among giraffes is primarily visual  <cit>  and given marked variation in pelage, assortative mating by pelage type could occur among some populations. for example, sexual imprinting, in which early exposure to conspecifics influences mate choice later in life  <cit> , can cause speciation between populations that have diverged in allopatry and experience reinforcement upon secondary contact  <cit> . although giraffes live in loose, non-territorial herds, calves are likely to be in close contact with only their mothers and other members of the local crèche until they are several months old  <cit> . thus, individual giraffes might develop pelage-specific mate preferences, even in regions of overlap between subspecies. in zoo settings, visual barriers to interbreeding might not be maintained if calves are exposed to multiple pelage types. these tentative hypotheses need testing from comparative field studies focused on giraffe dispersal and reproductive biology.

the fine-scaled patterns of population isolation we observe within giraffe subspecies  are surprising given that giraffe social groupings and home ranges are known to be highly transient  <cit> . however, our genetic results suggest that giraffe social structure might be much more stable over the long term than has been shown by previous short-term observational field studies  <cit>  and might also have a major influence on genetic differentiation among populations at larger geographic scales .

genetic units and potential giraffe species
the concordant genetic and phenotypic divisions among giraffe subspecies  and the near absence of hybrids even between parapatric subspecies  suggest that the giraffe might represent more than one species. criteria for species designation vary according to the taxonomic group considered and the biological properties emphasized. for example, the biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation  <cit>  whereas the phylogenetic species concept emphasizes fixed and diagnosable differences among species  <cit> . however, despite the differences among species concepts, there is a general consensus that species are separately-evolving metapopulation lineages united by gene flow  <cit> . we have shown that among giraffe subspecific groupings, including those that are adjacent to one another, there is an almost complete lack of gene flow, suggesting that these groups are reproductively isolated and thus constitute separate lineages. this conclusion is further supported by our mtdna-based coalescence analysis, which indicates that groups have been isolated from one another between  <dig>  and  <dig>  my . the demonstration of largely independent gene pools using both organellar and nuclear loci among proximate populations constitutes one of the strongest forms of evidence that speciation has occurred  <cit> . consequently, these arguments support viewing the giraffe as containing multiple distinct species rather than a single polytypic form. reciprocal monophyly in mtdna sequences and nearly absolute partitioning in microsatellite data support minimally six species, corresponding to giraffa peralta, g. rothschildi, g. reticulata, g. tippelskirchi, g. giraffa, and g. angolensis. further, the masai giraffe might constitute more than one species, consistent with its subdivision into populations east and west of the rift valley. however, additional taxa might be defined, pending analysis of the subspecies included in taxonomic schemes  not sampled by our study design . finally, many of these species appear to include multiple distinct population units that are genetically differentiated. despite the demonstrated capability for long distance dispersal  <cit> , ecological, historical and behavioral factors could have collectively caused differentiation in the giraffe comparable to that of highly sedentary species. consequently, individual dispersal, even in one of the most highly vagile terrestrial vertebrates, does not preclude an as yet uncertain isolating mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that, despite a high capacity for dispersal, the giraffe exhibits extensive population genetic structure in both mitochondrial and nuclear dna markers. further, our results indicate that neighbouring subspecies as well as those that are geographically separated are essentially reproductively isolated, suggesting that some might represent distinct species rather than a single polytypic form. minimally, the seven lineages that are reciprocally monophyletic in the mtdna tree  need to be considered evolutionarily significant units if not species, even under the most conservative definition of the term, whereas the remaining populations should be considered independent genetic units  <cit> , all needing separate population management.

our results have important implications with regards to the conservation of giraffe populations. giraffes were once continuously distributed throughout the dry savannas of africa, from algeria and morocco to south africa  <cit> . however, the geographic range of the giraffe has been severely fragmented during historic times due to increasing aridity and human population growth so that today, giraffes are discontinuously distributed from the sahel to south africa. recent estimates indicate that approximately  <dig> giraffes exist in africa  <cit> , but many populations are declining due to human pressures. for example, severe poaching and armed conflict in somalia, ethiopia, and kenya reduced the number of reticulated giraffes  from about  <dig> individuals in the 1990s to currently fewer than  <dig> individuals . the evolutionarily significant units that we have uncovered and their isolated constituent populations merit conservation and separate management. several of these previously unrecognized genetic units are highly endangered, such as the west african giraffe, numbering about only  <dig> individuals and restricted to a single area in niger  <cit> . however, the giraffe is currently listed as lower risk by the iucn red list  <cit>  under the assumption that all giraffe populations are considered a single species and therefore managed as such. our results show that even within well known and highly mobile species, subdivisions can exist and their lack of recognition could lead to further endangerment or even extinction  <cit> .
