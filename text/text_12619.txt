BACKGROUND
bacteriocins are bacterially produced peptide antibiotics. two major classes of gram-positive bacteriocins have been recognised, class i undergo significant post-translationally modifications while the class ii are unmodified  <cit> . the majority of the class i bacteriocins are lantibiotics; small peptides containing internal bridges resulting from the formation of lanthionine residues. the structural gene encodes a ribosomally synthesised precursor prepeptide which is generically named lana. this prepeptide contains a leader sequence at the n-terminus, which is ultimately cleaved, and a propeptide at the c-terminus. many or all of the serine and threonine residues within the propeptide are dehydrated to form dehydroalanine  and dehydrobutyrine , respectively. when these modified residues interact with an intrapeptide cysteine, a thioether bond is formed resulting in the formation of lanthionine  or Î²-methyl lanthionine .

the lantibiotics and lantipeptides  can be divided into four groups according to the nature of the enzymes which catalyse lan formation  <cit> . in the case of type  <dig> lantibiotics two enzymes are involved; lanb, the lanthionine dehydratase which catalyses the dehydration of the amino acids, and lanc, the lanthionine synthetase which catalyses thioether formation. type  <dig> lantibiotics contain a single lanm enzyme which performs both functions. type  <dig> and  <dig> are lantipeptides which are also catalysed by distinct enzymes such as the ramc-like and lanl enzymes  <cit> . the type  <dig> and  <dig> lantibiotics can also be further subdivided on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the unmodified propeptide. in the case of the type  <dig> lantibiotics, five such subgroups have been identified, each of which is named after the corresponding prototypical lantibiotic; the nisin-like, epidermin-like, pep5-like, streptin-like and planosporocin-like lantibiotic subgroups  <cit> . the nisin-like group is named for nisin a, which is the most extensively studied bacteriocin and is currently sold in more than  <dig> countries as a food preservative  <cit> . in addition to lana, b and c, other proteins involved in the the production of nisin a and other type  <dig> lantibiotics include lanp, a serine protease that cleaves the leader from the propeptide; lant, an abc transporter responsible for the transport of the lantibiotic precursor across the cell membrane; laniefg encode proteins involved in immunity and; lank, a histidine kinase and lanr, a response regulator, that together operate as a two-component regulatory system. land enzymes, such as that responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of c-terminal cysteines in epidermin  <cit> , are less common.

given the broad antimicrobial spectrum of many lantibiotics, the possibility of applying lantibiotics in a medicinal capacity has become the subject of much attention. this is supported by an enhanced understanding of their mechanisms of action  <cit>  and the dearth of novel antibiotics. of the type  <dig> lantibiotics, nisin, mutacin and planosporicin have been shown to be active against multi-drug resistant gram-positive pathogens  <cit> , pep <dig> and epidermin inhibit staphylococcus epidermidis adhesion to catheters  <cit>  and epidermin and gallidermin are active against propionibacterium acnes  <cit> . other lantibiotics, or their producer strains, have been used as food preservatives and as oral and gastrointestinal antimicrobials/probiotics  <cit> . as a consequence of this increased interest in lantibiotics, a concerted effort has taken place to identify new and improved forms of these peptides. culture based screening strategies have in the past been responsible for the identification of lantibiotics produced by bacteria isolated from diverse microbial niches including the oral cavity, intestine, soil, kefir grains and milk  <cit> . recently, an alternative means of identifying novel lantibiotics has emerged as a consequence of the increasing generation and availability of genomic and metagenomic sequence data. the availability of such information has recently led to the identification of the type  <dig> epidermin-like lantibiotic, bsa  <cit>  as well as type  <dig> lantibiotics such as haloduracin  <cit> , licheniciden  <cit> , as well as a range of cyanobacteria-associated lantipeptides  <cit> . this has prompted the development of on-line tools and repositories such as bagel and bactibase to facilitate such screening strategies  <cit> . notably, although an in-silico screen for lanm genes has recently resulted in the identification of  <dig> novel type  <dig> lantibiotic-like gene clusters  <cit> , a corresponding screen for type  <dig> lantibiotics has not yet been described. here we address this issue by screening for clusters containing genes homologous to the nisin a biosynthetic genes nisb  and nisc . in each case, the regions flanking the newly identified lanb/lanc genes were subjected to further in silico analysis to determine if they are potential lantibiotic/lantipeptide-associated gene clusters. this included a search of nearby open reading frames  which might encode a corresponding lana, defined as being of relatively short length  and containing an uneven distribution of cysteine, threonine and serine amino acids within the propeptide region. using this approach,  <dig> novel type  <dig> lantibiotic/lantipeptide-encoding clusters were identified. subsequent screening using the newly identified lana, b and c homologs as driver sequences revealed a further  <dig> gene clusters, resulting in a total of  <dig> putative novel type  <dig> lantibiotic clusters. significantly, many of these clusters are present in species, genera and phyla not previously associated with lantibiotic/lantipeptide production and are predicted to encode peptides which represent completely new type  <dig> subclasses.

RESULTS
in silico screen for lanc genes
an in silico screen for lanc homologues, using the nisc sequence as a driver, resulted in the identification of  <dig> homologues. of these  <dig> have previously been associated with lantibiotic production,  <dig> were orphan homologs  ,  <dig> were encoded within a cluster in which no lana could be detected  and one cluster contained two lancs . the remaining  <dig> potential lantibiotic/lantipeptide-encoding gene clusters all contained putative lana, b and c genes . the genes flanking the  <dig> novel lanc-like genes were subjected to further bioinformatic analysis to determine the presence of other orfs that share homology with genes linked to lantibiotic production or immunity. while these  <dig> clusters are the primary focus of this in silico analysis, the sequences of the newly identified lana, b and c proteins associated with these clusters were in turn used for further in silico screens. this approach uncovered an additional  <dig> clusters  that were also predicted to be novel lantibiotic/lantipeptide-encoding clusters, thereby yielding a total of  <dig> novel type  <dig> clusters.

*the existence of a lantibiotic gene cluster within these strains has been referred to briefly,  <cit>  and  <cit>  respectively, but these clusters have not been the focus of a detailed bioinformatic analysis.

all except one of the  <dig> gene clusters revealed following the initial screen were located within the genomes of firmicutes and actinobacteria. the exception was chitinophaga pinensis dsm  <dig> of the phylum bacteroidetes. of the other  <dig>  the genera most commonly associated with lantibiotic production were bacillus, geobacillus, clostridium, enterococcus, streptococcus, frankia and streptomyces. in many cases the novel clusters associated with a specific genus, such as those found on the streptomyces and frankia genomes, showed at least some similarity to each other. it was also noted that several of the genomes in which a cluster was located also contained an additional cluster , or other genes predicted to encode additional lana, b or c proteins , elsewhere in the genome. the  <dig> clusters are described below and are grouped according to the phylum and genus of the associated strain.

type  <dig> lantibiotic gene clusters in actinobacteria
identification of novel frankia-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
the frankia are nitrogen-fixing, root nodule-forming filamentous actinobacteria that live in symbiosis with actinorhizal plants. all species of frankia are closely related  <cit> . to date, four frankia genomes have been sequenced, i.e. frankia alni acn14a, frankia sp. ean1pec, frankia sp. cc <dig> and frankia sp. eui1c, and although no frankia-associated bacteriocins have previously been reported, a number of predicted lantibiotic clusters can be found in each case  in addition to a number of apparently lanb- and lanc-encoding genes which do not have an accompanying lana . this latter phenomenon could be a result of the frequent rearrangements which occur in frankia strains  <cit> . of the clusters identified, many resemble clusters associated with another genus of actinobacteria, the streptomyces.

frankia alni acn14a: the genome sequence of f. alni acn14a  <cit>  contains one complete cluster, f. alni acn14a ii which includes the predicted lana prepropeptide, fraal <dig>  fraal <dig> and fraal <dig> . the lana peptide does not resemble any of the previously characterised type  <dig> lantibiotic propeptides but is 79% identical to franean1_ <dig> of frankia sp. ean1pec . the lanb and lanc proteins resemble those associated with other frankia, as well as streptomyces, clusters. the lanc protein is also 62% identical to tcur_ <dig> of thermomonospora curvata dsm  <dig> , which itself appears to be encoded by an orf within a novel lantibiotic gene cluster. the acn14a ii cluster is also predicted to encode two proteins which share homology with o-methyltransferases . o-methyltransferases contribute to the production of a number of non-ribosomal antibiotics  <cit>  and catalyse the methylation of hydroxyl group on deoxysugar rings to protect the reactive hydroxyl group from undesired modifications and can alter the solubility and pharmacokinetic properties of the resulting molecule  <cit> . although o-methyltransferases have not previously been associated with lantibiotic production, this study reveals that many actinobacteria-associated type  <dig> clusters possess genes predicted to encode these enzymes.

frankia sp. cc13: the frankia sp. cc <dig> genome  <cit>  contains three gene clusters of interest . two o-methyltransferase-encoding genes were identified in each case and it was noted that the associated lanb and lanc proteins are similar to one another and to numerous others predicted to be produced by frankia and streptomyces species. in contrast, there is a lack of homology between the three lana genes. the lana gene from cluster i was not previously annotated and was only identified following closer inspection of the dna sequence. the cluster ii-associated lana, francci3_ <dig>  most closely resembles frankia sp. eui1c fraeui1cdraft_ <dig>  while the third, and also previously unannotated lana appears to be one of an extended group of frankia- and streptomyces-associated lanas that includes frankia sp. eui1c fraeui1cdraft_ <dig> .

frankia ean1pec: the frankia ean1pec genome  <cit>  contains  <dig> putative lanb-encoding genes three of which correspond to potential lantibiotic/lantipeptide-associated gene clusters  which again resemble those of streptomyces and other frankia species, and contain o-methyltransferase-encoding genes. within the first cluster, a putative lana prepropeptide, encoded by a previously unannotated orf located between franean1_ <dig> and the lanb determinant, is homologous to a number of other lanas, including sare_ <dig> of salinispora arenicola cns- <dig> . the cluster is also noteworthy be virtue of the presence of two lanc-encoding genes, franean1_ <dig> and franean1_ <dig>  within frankia ean1pec iii, the lana peptide, encoded by franean1_ <dig> is 42% identical to fraeui1cdraft_ <dig> of frankia sp. eui1c while finally, a screen using f. alni acn14a fraal <dig> as a driver led to the identification of yet another cluster  which closely resembles cluster ii of f. alni acn14a ii.

frankia sp. eui1c: frankia sp. eui1c contains a single putative lantibiotic/lantipeptide gene cluster  which again contains lanb, c and o-methyltransferase genes typical of frankia and streptomyces clusters. the associated lana homolog  is notable by virtue of being 46% identical to sscg_ <dig>  a known lana of streptomyces clavuligerus atcc  <dig> while a gene encoding an abc transporter related protein  is also present.

identification of novel salinispora -associated lantibiotic gene clusters
salinispora are marine actinobacteria. there are two recognised species, s. tropicalis and s. arenicola. representatives have been sequenced in each case and genes predicted to encode non-lantibiotic bacteriocins have been identified in both cases  <cit> . the existence of a putative lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster, between sare_ <dig> and sare_ <dig>  in the genome of s. arenicola cns- <dig> was noted previously  <cit> . however, this cluster has not been the subject of a detailed bioinformatic characterisation. our analysis reveals that sare_ <dig> apparently encodes a lana peptide which is 88% identical to that encoded by micaudraft_ <dig> of micromonospora aurantiaca atcc  <dig>  the proteins encoded by sare_ <dig>  and sare_ <dig>  also resemble other atcc 27029-associated proteins  and micaudraft_ <dig> ), thereby revealing an additional novel cluster in micromonospora, a genus better known for its production of non-ribosomal antibiotics such gentamycin and netamycin  <cit>  .

identification of novel stackebrandtia-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
stackebrandtia are aerobic, non-motile actinobacteria which have been isolated from soil  <cit> . there are only  <dig> associated species i.e. s. albiflava and s. nassauensis and in silico analysis of s. nassauensis dsm  <dig>  reveals the presence of two similar clusters  . the hypothetical lana, encoded by snas_ <dig>  of the first cluster showed a singular homology of 78% identity to snas_ <dig> of the second cluster. the corresponding lanbs  are 62% identical while the lancs  are 68% identical.

identification of novel streptomyces-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
bacteria from the genus streptomyces, comprising over  <dig> species, are filamentous, high g-c bacteria found frequently in soil and rotting vegetation. they are the most numerous and ubiquitous soil bacteria  <cit> . streptomyces are also responsible for the production of over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin   <cit> . although a number of streptomyces-associated bacteriocins, such as ancovenin  <cit>  and cinnamycin  <cit> , have been identified, this number is relatively small considering the size of the genus. as was apparent above, our in silico analysis has revealed that many streptomyces possess potentially lantibiotic-encoding gene clusters which resemble those found in frankia. once again, the majority of these clusters contain o-methyltransferases .

streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064
s. clavuligerus is an aerobic, mesophillic streptomyces sp. while there have been no previous reports of bacteriocin production by this species, two lantibiotic clusters were found to be present on the genome of s. clavuligerus atcc  <dig>  in the first of these clusters, the associated hypothetical lana, b and c proteins  are 63%, 42% and 50% identical to the corresponding proteins of frankia sp. cci <dig> ii. blast analysis of these proteins also revealed another novel cluster in streptomyces viridochromogenes dsm  <dig> corresponding to svird4_ <dig> , svird4_ <dig>  and svird4_ <dig>  . the second s. clavuligerus cluster, which contains sscg_ <dig> , sscg_ <dig>  and sscg_ <dig> , resembled clusters present in a number of other strains such as that of streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus nbrc  <dig>  <cit>  . blast analysis of these sequences also led to the identification of yet another novel cluster in streptomyces sp. spb <dig> .

streptomyces coelicolor a3
streptomyces coelicolor a <dig>  is the best characterised representive of its genus  <cit>  and was the first streptomyces strain to have its genome sequenced  <cit> . although bacteriocins/bacteriocin-like peptides are known to be produced by this species , such peptides have not previously been associated with this strain. here blast analysis revealed the presence of two lantibiotic/lantipeptide clusters  i and s. coelicolor a <dig> ii). the first of these clusters, containing sco <dig> , sco <dig>  and sco <dig> , very closely resembles streptomyces griseoflavus tu <dig> cluster ii . subsequent blast searches with the a <dig> cluster i-associated proteins led in turn to the discovery of an almost identical cluster in streptomyces lividans tk <dig> which contains sspg_ <dig> , sspg_ <dig>  and sspg_ <dig>  . the second cluster, streptomyces coelicolor a <dig> ii, is predicted to encode two lana peptides,  which are 97% identical to each other, as well as lanb  and lanc  proteins with homology  with corresponding proteins associated with frankia sp. cci <dig>  such analysis also revealed another cluster of interest in the actinomycete, catenulispora acidiphila dsm  <dig> .

streptomyces griseoflavus tu4000
three lantibiotic/lantipeptide clusters were identified on the genome of this anaerobic, terrestrial streptomyces. although the lana encoded within the first cluster  does not significantly resemble any other protein, the associated lanb  and lanc  proteins are homologous to the corresponding proteins of s. coelicolor a <dig> cluster i and tu <dig> cluster ii. blast searches using the cluster i proteins as drivers also resulted in the identification of several additional clusters in nocardiopsis dassonvillei dsm  <dig> , streptomyces sp. mg <dig>  and two clusters on the genome of m. aurantiaca atcc  <dig> . in addition to the components of the second cluster referred to above, an associated lana  was also noted. in addition to the tu <dig> i and a <dig> i clusters, this cluster is also highly identical to that of s. lividans tk <dig> . the lana associated with the final cluster  again bears no homology with any other known peptides whereas the lanb  and lanc  corresponded to those of frankia sp. ean1pec ii .

type  <dig> lantibiotic gene clusters in firmicutes
identification of novel bacillus-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
bacillus is a large and diverse genus of rod-shaped, sporulating, obligate aerobes which contains both free living and pathogenic species. a number of type  <dig> lantibiotics have previously been characterized in this genus . the nisc-driven screen highlighted the presence of a type  <dig> lantibiotic cluster in the genomes of two bacillus strains i.e. bacillus cereus f <dig> and bacillus mycoides dsm  <dig> . bioinformatic analysis of these clusters revealed two further clusters in b. cereus atcc  <dig> and b. cereus ah <dig> 

bacillus cereus f65185
b. cereus f <dig> is a mesophilic bacterium sourced from a human wound containing one lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster which is unusual in that  <dig> orfs separate the putative lanb and c genes and the two have a divergent orientation. the predicted lana  does not resemble any other known lantibiotic prepropeptides. the lanb homolog  resembles a putative lanb associated with clostridium cellulovorans 743b  while the predicted lanc  most closely resembles two further 743b proteins . however the 743b strain lacks an associated lana. further blast analysis with the f65185-associated lanb highlighted the presence of a related protein within thiocillin-encoding gene cluster in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  <cit> .

bacillus mycoides dsm 2048
b. mycoides is a non-motile, non-pathogenic, saprophytic bacillus, strains of which have been investigated with a view to their application as biological pesticides. although representatives of this species have been associated with bacteriocin production  <cit> , there are no published reports of lantibiotic-producing b. mycoides. the dsm  <dig> genome contains a lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster that contains putative lana, b, c and other lantibiotic-associated genes which is very similar to other novel clusters in b. cereus ah <dig> and b. cereus ah <dig>  bmyco0001_ <dig> is the predicted prepropeptide and is 100% identical to the products of the b. cereus ah1272-associated bcere0029_ <dig> and bcere0029_ <dig>  it is also 58% identical to prepropeptides associated with several staphylococcus-associated bsa lantibiotics, such as bsaa2rf <dig> of s. aureus rf <dig>  <cit> . it is thus apparent that the lana is a member of the epidermin-like peptides. in addition to homologues in b. cereus ah <dig> and ah <dig>  use of the dsm 2048-associated lanb and lanc sequences as drivers also surprisingly highlighted a gene cluster present in actinomyces sp. oral taxon  <dig> . in addition to homology with respect to lanb and lanc proteins , the proposed lana  is 43% identical to bmyco0001_ <dig> and bcere0029_ <dig> and bcere0029_ <dig> of bacillus mycoides dsm  <dig> and bacillus cereus ah <dig>  respectively.

identification of novel clostridium-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
the clostridia are gram postitive anaerobic, endospore-forming firmicutes of which there are approximately  <dig> species. these include important pathogens such as clostridium difficile, clostridium perfingens and clostridium tetani. several clostridium-associated bacteriocins have been characterised from this genus  <cit> , but no type  <dig> lantibiotic producers have been identified to date. here, bioinformatic analysis revealed one clostridium-associated lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster, located on the genome of c. perfringens cpe str. f <dig> .

c. perfringens cpe str. f4969
c. perfringens is one of the leading causes of food-borne illness in the developed world, usually as a result of the improper sterilization of canned foods in which endospores have germinated. it can also be responsible for wound and surgical infections  <cit> . the predicted lana  of strain f <dig> is most closely related to the lanas of b. mycoides dsm  <dig> and b. cereus ah <dig>  while the proteins encoded by ac5_a <dig>  and ac5_a <dig>  most closely resemble proteins associated with geobacillus sp. g11mc <dig> . surprisingly, blast analysis also highlighted the presence of a related lanb homolog encoded within a lantibiotic/lantipeptide-like gene cluster in the genome of parachlamydia acanthamoebae  str. hall's coccus . adjacent genes of note within the p. acanthamoebae cluster include pah_c028o <dig>  and pah_c028o <dig> .

identification of novel enterococcus-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
the enterococci are gram positive lactic acid bacteria which are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans but can also be pathogens. many enterococcus-associated bacteriocins  have been identified  <cit> . only one enterococcus-associated lantibiotic, the type  <dig> peptide cytolysin, has been identified to date  <cit> . here we describe genes which potentially encode the first type  <dig> enterococcus-associated lantibiotic .

enterococcus faecalis fly1: e. faecalis
fly <dig>  is a non-motile, facultative anaerobe. within its genome we identified a previously unannotated lana determinant, through analysis of raw sequence data. the corresponding peptide is homologous to c. perfringens cpe str. f <dig> , as well as a number of epidermin-like lanas in other bacilli. the putative lanb protein is split across two orfs, efkg_ <dig>  and efkg_ <dig> , with both components most closely resembling the n-terminus of the dehydratase of streptococcus pyogenes mgas <dig>  mgas10270_spy <dig>  it is unclear whether the apparent frameshift in the fly <dig> lanb is genuine or the result of a sequencing error. the lanc-like efkg_ <dig>  was most closely related to the corresponding protein in g. thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig> .

identification of novel geobacillus-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
geobacilli are thermophillic , aerobic, spore-forming firmicutes. they have been isolated from various terrestrial and marine environments, in geothermal, temperate and permanently cold habitats. reclassified in  <dig>  <cit> , these bacteria are of industrial interest as sources of thermostable enzymes. bacteriocins have been identified in geobacillus stearothermophilus  <cit>  and geobacillus thermoleovorans  <cit> , and while screening for lanm-producing gene clusters has highlighted the potential existence of a number of type  <dig> lantibiotics  <cit> , associated type  <dig> lantibiotics have not previously been described. here, three putative type  <dig> lantibiotic/lantipeptide-encoding clusters within the genomes of geobacillus kaustophilus hta <dig>  geobacillus thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig> and geobacillus sp. g11mc <dig>  are described.

geobacillus kaustophilus hta426
g. kaustophilus grows optimally in aquatic environments at 60Â°c with an upper temperature limit of 74Â°c. from a lantibiotic persepective, genome xsequencing of hta <dig> revealed a hypothetical protein annotated as a 'lantibiotic precursor' gk <dig>  our analysis revealed that this putative lana is 91% identical to another prepropeptide encoded by the closely located gk <dig> gene. it is also 100% identical to orphan 'lantibiotic precursor' homologs  in geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig> and geobacillus sp. y412mc <dig>  respectively. more distantly related lanas  are also associated with the genomes of geobacillus thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig>  and geobacillus sp. g11mc <dig> . the homology between the geobacillus lanas is highest within the leader regions, but, as is the case with nisin-, epidermin- and streptin-like lantibiotics, a conserved serine and ctpgc motif in the n-terminus of the propeptide is present, which is believed to be involved in the binding of these lantibiotics to lipid ii in the cell wall in gram positive bacteria  <cit> . blast analysis of the gk0286-encoded lana highlighted the presence of another potential lantibiotic/lantipeptide cluster in corynebacterium lipophiloflavum dsm  <dig> . within the hta <dig> cluster, the proteins predicted to be encoded by gk0300/ <dig>  and gk <dig> are homologous to those associated with many other geobacilli. it was also noted that this cluster is less condensed than typical lantibiotic gene clusters in that there are insertions of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes  between the lantibiotic associated genes.

geobacillus thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig> and geobacillus sp. g11mc16:
g. thermodenitrificans are facultative soil bacteria with denitrification qualities. representatives of this species grow between 45Â°c and 73Â°c . ng80- <dig> was isolated from a deep-subsurface oil reservoir in dagang oilfield, northern china  <cit>  and on the basis of in-silico analysis is potentially the producer of both a type  <dig>  and type  <dig> lantibiotic  <cit> . our analysis reveals that the type i lantibiotic/lantipeptide operons in g. thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig> and geobacillus sp. g11mc <dig> are very highly conserved. the two lanas are 100% identical and the homology between these, and indeed the associated b and cs, and the corresponding g. kaustophilus hta <dig> proteins is discussed above. it was noted that the lanb of geobacillus sp. g11mc <dig> is apparently frameshifted  and g11mc16draft_ <dig> ) but that this is not the case in g. thermodenitrificans ng80- <dig> .

identification of novel staphylococcus-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
the staphylococci are non-sporeforming, non-motile firmicutes. the genus staphylococcus contains  <dig> species, most of which are harmless and reside normally on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and other organisms. however, staphylococci can also cause a wide variety of diseases either through toxin production or penetration and are a common cause of food poisoning and nosocomial infections. several strains of staphylococcus epidermidis have been shown to be producers of type  <dig> lantibiotics, including epidermin  <cit> , pep <dig>  <cit> , epicidin  <dig>  <cit>  and epilancin k <dig>  <cit> , gallidermin was isolated from s. gallinarum  <cit>  while staphylococcin au <dig>  <cit>  and bsa  <cit>  were isolated from s. aureus. blast analysis has revealed that several other s. aureus strains possess gene clusters similar to those associated with bsa and bsarf <dig>  <cit> . these clusters were identified in s. aureus a <dig>  d <dig> and h <dig>  in a <dig>  sapg_ <dig> and sapg_ <dig> correspond to the bsaa <dig> and bsaa <dig> peptides of s. aureus mw <dig> . the precursor peptides of the d <dig>  and h <dig>  strains are 100% identical. the peptides encoded by satg_ <dig> and saug_ <dig> are 93% identical to bsaa1rf <dig> of s. aureus rf <dig>  while those corresponding to.satg_ <dig> and saug_ <dig> are 100% identical to bsaa2rf <dig> 

identification of novel streptococcus-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
these facultative anaerobes of the phylum firmicutes are spherical in shape and grow in long chains. many species are part of the normal commensal flora of the mouth, skin, intestine and upper respiratory tract of humans but the genus also includes numerous human pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae, pyogenes and agalactiae. the streptococci are known to producers of type  <dig> lantibiotics  <cit> , such as streptin  <cit> , some mutacins  <cit> , nisin u and nisin u <dig>  <cit> , as well as several non-lantibiotic bacteriocins. here we discuss two clusters, identified in strains of s. pyogenes and s. thermophilus lmg  <dig> 

streptococcus pyogenes mgas10270
s. pyogenes  is the cause of many important human diseases ranging from mild superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic diseases. bacteriocin production by these strains may give them a competitive advantage against the natural skin microbiota. it has previously been established that many s. pyogenes strains, as well as strains of streptococcus salivarius, produce the type  <dig> lantibiotic salivaricin a or closely related variants  <cit> . the type  <dig> streptins  and type  <dig> streptococcin a-ff <dig> are also s. pyogenes associated  <cit> . here our analysis focuses on a type  <dig> cluster within the genome of s. pyogenes mgas <dig>  <cit> . this includes mgas10270_spy <dig>  which is 100% identical to the propeptide sequence of streptin. while this lantibiotic is thus not novel, subsequent blast searches were revealing in that they highlighted the presence of a lana with 97% identity in s. pyogenes mgas <dig>  which is contained within a cluster which also encodes a lanb  and lanc .

streptococcus thermophilus lmg 18311
s. thermophilus is a thermophillic, non-pathogenic streptococcus. it is of major importance to the fermented dairy food industry. a number of non-lantibiotic bacteriocins  from this species have been characterized, including thermophilin  <dig>  <cit> , thermophilin a  <cit>  and thermophilin st- <dig>  <cit> . strain lmg  <dig> was sequenced in  <dig> and at the time it was noted that bacteriocin production was one of the characteristics that distinguishes it from strain cnrz <dig>  <cit> . while the existence of a putative lantibiotic/lantipeptide gene cluster in lmg  <dig> has been reported  <cit> , this cluster  has not been the focus of a detailed in silico analysis. the associated lana, encoded by stu <dig>  is homologous with that predicted to be encoded by spcg_ <dig> of s. pneumoniae cgsp <dig>  which, on the basis of previous in silico analysis, is also within a lantibiotic gene cluster  <cit> . the lanb protein  is 73% identical to spcg_ <dig> of s. pneumoniae cgsp <dig> and 97% identical to a truncated lanb associated with s. thermophilus cnrz <dig>  <cit> .

type  <dig> lantibiotic gene clusters in bacteroidetes
the bacteroidetes are a highly diverse phylum found in soil, seawater and the skin and intestines of animals. the bacteroidales class, which includes the genus bacteroides, are the best-studied of the phylum. bacteroides comprises the most substantial portion of the human gastrointestinal tract  <cit>  some of which are opportunistic pathogens  <cit> .

identification of novel chitinophaga-associated lantibiotic gene clusters
chitinophaga are rod-shaped mesophiles of the phylum bacteroidetes which are are noted for their ability to degrade chitin  <cit> . there have been no reports to date of bacteriocin production by any of the  <dig> chitinophaga species. chitinophaga pinensis dsm  <dig>  is unusual in that it appears to be a bacteroidetes possessing genes encoding a type  <dig> lantibiotic . there are two predicted lana peptides, corresponding to cpin_ <dig> and cpin_ <dig>  which are 50% identical as a consequence of similar n-terminii. adjacent orfs of note include cpin_ <dig> and cpin_ <dig>  predicted to encode a Î²-lactamase and a 2-component transcriptional regulator of the luxr family, respectively. blast analysis of the associated lanb and lanc proteins  revealed another putative lanb  and lanc  encoded within the same genome. within this second c. pinensis-associated cluster, cpin_ <dig> possess a number of features which suggest that it may be a lana-encoding gene. interestingly, blast analysis of the cpin_3397-encoded lanc also led to the identification of a number of additional homologs apparently encoded within the genomes of strains not previously associated with lantibiotic production. the genome of another bacteroidetes, spirosoma linguale dsm  <dig>  is notable in that it contains  <dig> putative lanb-encoding genes and  <dig> putative lanc-encoding genes. of these only one lanb protein  and one lanc protein , are encoded within what appears to be a novel lantibiotic-associated gene cluster. this cluster contains  <dig> potentially lana-encoding genes, slin_4706- <dig>  slin_ <dig> and slin_ <dig>  which are identical and share 58% identity with slin_ <dig>  the genome of another bacteroidetes species, pedobacter heparinus dsm  <dig> , contains a cluster encoding two lanbs , a lanc  and a potential lana . a cluster within kordia algicida ot- <dig> contains lanb , lanc  and lana determinants  while microscilla marina atcc  <dig> potentially has five associated lanb homologs, but of these, the lanb corresponding to m23134_ <dig>  was the only one to be located in close proximity to one of multiple lanc proteins . the putative lana, m23134_ <dig>  does not resemble any other known proteins.

phylogenetics of lanabc
the conserved nature of lanb and lanc proteins facilitated a phylogenetic analysis of their relatedness. the resultant cladogram of lanb enzymes  highlights the existence of two distinct phylogroups . the first phylogroup contains actinobacteria-associated lanbs, all of which are from strains not previously known to be producers of lantibiotics/lantipeptides. the second contains a variety of lanthionine synthetases associated with known lantibiotics , some uncovered by previous in silico analysis , novel clusters from genera with which lantibiotic production has previously been attributed as well as genera not previously associated with lantibiotic production. within this second phylogroup one finds two subgroups; one consisting of bacteroidetes-associated lanbs  and a second consisting of firmicutes-associated lanb's  as well as that from p. ancanthamoeba. among the firmicutes-associated lanbs further subclustering is evident. one common branch contains three offshoots;  bacillus/geobacillus/enterococcus/clostridium,  s. pyogenes and  p. acanthamoebae str. hall's coccus lanbs. the staphylococcus lanbs and that of mutacin  <dig>  also form a distinct subgroup as do those encoded with the genomes of s. thermophilus lmg  <dig> and s. pneumoniae cgsp <dig>  curiously the epicidin  lanb does not group with any other lanb.

the cladogram of the corresponding lanthionine synthetases  is quite similar to that of the dehydratases . all can be positioned into one of two phylogroups . phylogroup  <dig> contains six bacteroidetes-associated lanc's. in contrast phylogroup  <dig> is large and can be further divided into group 2a, which are actinobacteria-associated, and the firmicutes-associated group 2b. further subgrouping follows the patterns identified from analysis of the lanb cladogram.  <dig> exceptional lancs that avoid subgrouping include those associated with c. lipophiloflavum dsm  <dig>  s. thermophilus lmg 18311/s. pneumoniae cgsp <dig>  epicidin, b. cereus f <dig>  n. dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei dsm  <dig>  nisin-producing lactococci and actinomyces sp. oral taxon  <dig> 

a cladogram of the less highly conserved lanas revealed  <dig> major branches, several of which contain only one corresponding lana . notably the various phylogroups do not group in a phylum specific manner to the same extent as was evident in lanb and lanc cladograms. the largest phylogroups, i.e. phylogroups  <dig> and  <dig>  are those containing the nisin-like and epidermin-like peptides, respectively. while phylogroup  <dig> is, with the exception of the actinomyces sp. oral taxon 848-associated lana, composed of firmicutes-associated lanas, phylogroup  <dig> contains lanas from both firmicutes and actinobacteria. this phylogroup contains three subgroups, with subgroup 11a containing lanas from e. faecalis fly <dig> and c. perfringens f <dig>  11b contains actinobacteria-associated lanas and 11c contains both actionobacteria- and firmicutes-associated lanas. of the other phylogroups, phylogroups  <dig> and  <dig> are largest and contain chlamydiae/bacteroidetes- and actinobacteria-associated lanas, respectively.

alignment of lanabc
the availability of a significant number of lana, b and c protein sequences enabled further in silico analysis to identify conserved motifs and residues. alignment of  <dig> lanb proteins highlighted a number conserved motifs which are summarised in table  <dig>  a yxxr motif  is conserved in 89% of the lanb enzymes, while a gxg motif  is present in 92% of lanbs, with the lanb of c. lipophiloflavum being exceptional by virtue of lacking both glycine residues. a grf motif  is fully conserved in 86% of lanbs with the streptomyces sp. mg <dig> iii lanb being the only protein to lack this motif. an rxtpfg motif  is present in 77% of lanbs but is completely absent from the lanbs of geobacillus sp. g11mc <dig>  streptomyces sp. mg <dig> iii, m. aurantiaca and c. lipophiloflavum. a fxxxyg motif  is present in 82% of lanbs and, although present in only 50% of lanbs, a pxxxrxxnv  motif is at least partially conserved in many such proteins i.e. 94% contain the proline, 71% contain the nv residues and the least conserved is the arginine with 71% conservation. elsewhere, there is a rfl motif  conserved in 51% of lanbs, a ryg motif  conserved in 85% of lanbs and a hxxxnr motif  in 70% of the dehydratases. n addition to these, there are multiple highly conserved residues such as aspartates at residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  prolines at  <dig> and  <dig> and a leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

 residues are numbered according to their position in nisb

alignment of the lanc protein also revealed several conserved regions . of these, chg and wcyg motifs were particularly notable. the chg motif  was found to be conserved in 98% of the lancs. the cysteine <dig> and histidine <dig> residues, which act as ligands to the zinc in the active site of nisc, have been shown to be necessary for enzyme activity  <cit> . the wcyg motif  was present in 95% of the aligned enzymes. within the wcyg motif, tryptophan <dig>  and cysteine <dig>  have been shown to be vital to subtilin and nisin biosynthesis   <cit> . it has previously been shown that although alanine subsititution of tyrosine <dig>  results in enzyme inactivation, a phenylalanine change is tolerated indicating that the presence of an aromatic ring at this position is of key importance  <cit> . in the same study, a preceding arginine residue , present in 86% of these enzymes, was found not to be essential for enzyme activity. 92% of lancs also contained a closely located gly <dig> residue. the histidine <dig> of another highly conserved motif, gxahgxxg , together with a conserved aspartic acid <dig>  are thought to be involved in the electrophilic activation of the carbonyl group of dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine or in the protonation of the enolate   <cit> . the hg of this latter motif was conserved in 98% of the enzymes . in addition to these, other motifs of note included lxxg , gxxxgxxgxxlxl  and ydxxxgxxg . highly conserved single residues include gly <dig>  and tryp <dig> and tryp <dig> .

although lana peptides are less conserved than their modification enzymes, some motifs were evident . a dld motif present in the leader region of the almost all phylogroup  <dig> lanas is also found in many other lanas. indeed, the leucine of this motif is conserved across 93% of the  <dig> aligned peptides. the only peptides lacking this residue are those from m. marina, b. cereus f <dig>  n. dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei and p. heparinus as well as mutacin  <dig>  the leader regions from many actinobacteria, and especially those from phylogroup  <dig>  are also distinctive as a consequence of the frequent presence of proline residues.

within the propeptide, the most highly conserved residues are cysteines corresponding to positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the nisin a prepropeptide  <cit>  which significantly are within the lipid ii-binding region of the peptide. these cysteines are each found in 86% of the type  <dig> lanas. the actinobacteria in phylogroups  <dig> and  <dig> also share a conserved or partially conserved dgcg motif in the propeptide region. a less highly conserved ac motif which is closer to the c terminus is also evident. in addition to motifs which are conserved across motifs, a large number of motifs which are conserved within phylogroups are evident.

CONCLUSIONS
the in silico strategy adopted here resulted in the initial identification of  <dig> proteins which share 20-30% identity with nisc. further investigation of novel lanc proteins in turn led to the identification of even more homologs, revealing novel lantibiotic/lantipeptide associated clusters and establishing the existence of subgroups of lana, b and c proteins. theoretically, additional homologs could be identified through a continuation of this method but the rate at which new homologs would be identified would begin to level off. the approach taken led to the identification of  <dig> novel clusters which, prior to this study, had not been the subject of a detailed bioinformatic analysis. while the in silico identification of gene clusters in a strain will not always be confirmed by detection of an associated lantibiotic/lantipeptide, past experience  <cit>  suggests that there is likely to be a strong correlation. it is thus anticipated that the peptides produced by these gene clusters will represent a valuable resource, as will be the associated biosynthetic proteins.

this study reveals new details regarding type  <dig> lantibiotics and their associated clusters. type  <dig> lantibiotics have been predominantly associated with the firmicutes, with the actinobacteria-produced planosporicin and microbisporicin being notable exceptions. it is thus interesting to find type  <dig> clusters distributed among the genomes of bacteria representing four different phyla, the actinobacteria, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and chlamydiae, which have been isolated from a diverse range of habitats including soil, skin, intestines and the deep-sea. indeed, based on these investigations, it would appear that such clusters are as common among actinobacteria as they are among firmicutes, with streptomyces and frankia sp. being particularly rich sources. the actinobacteria clusters are, in general, quite similar, typically encoding a lana, b, c and a methyltransferase. the role of the methyltransferase is not clear but may serve to protect specific serine and threonine residues from lanb-mediated dehydration. the presence of five clusters within the genomes of five bacteroidetes, a phylum in which bacteriocin production is purportedly quite rare, is particularly noteworthy. however, the sequencing of additional representatives of this species may well reveal this to be a common feature. the p. acanthamoebae cluster is unusual by virtue of its presence in a representative of the chlamydiae. phylogenetic analysis indicates that the lanb and lanc proteins from this strain are closely related to those of several firmicutes and thus the cluster may originally have been acquired from such a source.

the availability of a much larger collection of lana, b and c sequences for further in silico analysis is also extremely useful for a number of other reasons. in addition to providing greater certainty with respect to the proposed conservation of particular motifs, it also reveals the existence of a greater number of subgroups of sequences than was previously apparent. this is particularly important with respect to lanas as alignment of these peptides has previously been employed as a means of subgrouping type  <dig> lantibiotics  <cit> . ultimately, the most significant outcome has been the number of new type  <dig> lantibiotic gene clusters. when one considers that less than  <dig> type  <dig> lantibiotics had been identified prior to this study, this represents a major expansion. while the genome sequenced strains themselves can be accessed with a view to purifying the associated peptides and/or utilising the biosynthetic machinery, the information gathered will also encourage researchers to include actinobacteria and bacteroiodetes when carrying out wet lab-based screens for novel lantibiotic producers. a combination of this approach and analysis of newly generated bacterial genome sequence data will ensure that many more lantibiotics and lantipetides will soon be discovered which are associated with unusual microorganisms and a wide variety of environments.
