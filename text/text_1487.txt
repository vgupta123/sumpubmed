BACKGROUND
ticks have been successful as ectoparasites due to morphological and physiological adaptations  <cit> . as obligate hematophagous  arthropods, ticks transmit various bacterial and viral diseases, e.g., babesiosis, theileriosis, anaplasmosis, lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, and, thus greatly impact human and animal health  <cit> . to combat host defense mechanisms, ticks possess powerful pharmacological proteins in their saliva that are injected into the vertebrate host during blood feeding  <cit> . our current understanding of host-parasite interactions has been greatly impacted by the revolution in sequencing technologies that has provided a massive amount of data previously unimaginable  <cit> . among the various transcriptome studies to date, transcriptome projects from arthropod disease vectors are using sanger or next generation sequencing techniques. these include several salivary gland  transcriptome and proteome projects  from hard tick  <cit>  and soft tick species  <cit> . hundreds of novel sg transcripts that putatively encode proteins were discovered from these sialome projects, thus elucidating how ticks may complete a blood meal while providing insight towards their evolutionary expansion  <cit> .

available sg transcriptomes show that the most frequently secreted tick salivary protein families are lipocalins, enzymes, and protease inhibitors. among protease inhibitors, kunitz-domain transcripts are one of the most abundant protein families in tick sgs  <cit> . the archetypal kunitz fold is highly conserved, resembling the first kunitz-domain protein, the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor  that was functionally described in  <dig> by moses kunitz  <cit> . to date, about  <dig> single kunitz-domain peptides from ticks have been functionally characterized. classical serine protease inhibitors were analyzed from the hard ticks rhipicephalus microplus   <cit> , rhipicephalus appendiculatus   <cit> , rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides   <cit> , haemaphysalis longicornis   <cit> , amblyomma cajennense   <cit> , and ixodes scapularis   <cit> . protease inhibitors were also characterized from the soft ticks ornithodoros moubata   <cit>  and ornithodoros savignyi  that mainly function as anti-clotting agents. anti-platelet inhibitors were also identified as single kunitz-domain inhibitors, such as the monogrins  from argas monolakensis <cit> , and, their orthologs disagregin  <cit>  and savignygrin from ornithodoros spp.  <cit> . several tick salivary kunitz-domain proteins that possess multiple domains  were also characterized as serine protease inhibitors  <cit> . of all the tick sgs kunitz-domain proteins, however, single kunitz-domain peptides are highly represented   <cit> . these kunitz peptides vary in their cysteine  motifs  with some lacking the archetypal disulfide bonds causing a more flexible fold, therefore diversifying their inhibitory activity  <cit> .

kunitz sg peptides of i. scapularis were phylogenetically analyzed to uncover their emergence in ticks and the expression trends of these kunitz peptides were also statistically analyzed  <cit> . these kunitz peptides were categorized in three different groups  based on their cys motif. the i. scapularis kunitz peptides belonging to group i were suggested to represent the ancestor of all tick kunitz-domain family . several kunitz peptides seemed to have lost their ability to function as serine protease inhibitors and instead to block and/or modulate ion channels, possibly related to the tick’s necessity for prolonged feeding on the vertebrate host  <cit> . the authors are aware of only one study that functionally and structurally characterized a tick kunitz peptide as an ion channel effector, the maxik channel modulator ra-klp from r. appendiculatus <cit> . this paucity must be remedied since dai et al.  <cit>  putatively characterize the majority of i. scapularis kunitz peptides as ion channel blockers/modulators. furthermore, fry et al.  <cit>  have argued that hematophagous secreted proteins, such as of the kunitz family, should be classified as venomous. most classified toxins are stabilized by their disulfide bridges and once these toxins become functionally essential as a venom, their adaptation is often reinforced by gene duplication  <cit> . gene sharing and gene duplication are the main mechanisms advocated to explain the functional heterogeneity of tick salivary kunitz family proteins  <cit> .

in our study, we used computational, structural bioinformatics and phylogenetic methods to reevaluate tick salivary kunitz peptides from a more in-depth structural point of view by analyzing the functional, antigenic, and evolutionary characteristics of kunitz peptides from the recently annotated ixodes ricinus sg transcriptome  <cit> ; genbank bioproject prjna <dig>  compared to classical biochemical analyses and classical sanger sequencing techniques that revealed only a few thousands of sequences from tick transcriptome studies presented until today , the large amount of available data of the  <dig> pyrosequencing/illumina i. ricinus sg transcriptome makes it feasible to thoroughly analyze multigenic protein families . in the i. ricinus transcriptome, 4% of all illumina reads were classified as transcripts encoding for kunitz-domain proteins and of these,  <dig> % accounted for single kunitz-domain transcripts   <cit> . our approach demonstrates how to interpret next generation transcriptome data to expand our understanding of the molecular, structural and functional evolution of hematophagy in ticks. our overall analysis developed a novel concept that elucidates the divergence and adaptation of i. ricinus salivary kunitz peptides that we call target-oriented evolution.

RESULTS
organizing the different i. ricinus sg kunitz peptides based on their cys motifs facilitates functional predictions
from the 454/illumina sg i. ricinus transcriptome  <cit> , we found archetypal kunitz peptides containing  <dig> cys residues and variants containing an additional 7th cys residue adjacent to the conserved 5th cys residue . based on their cys motif we were able to organize these tick salivary kunitz peptides into  <dig> groups  and a group with ≤ <dig> cys in their amino acid  sequences – we will refer to these peptides as simple kunitz , hereafter. the pfam server  verified that all  <dig> groups plus the sks possess the conserved single kunitz-domain. group g <dig> is the only i. ricinus kunitz peptide group that possesses a different disulfide bond pattern since it lacks the archetypal kunitz/bpti cys <dig> and cys <dig> disulfide bridge . the 3d modeled structures of all group representatives from figure  <dig> show that the overall archetypal tertiary kunitz fold is highly conserved regardless of the deviated disulfide bridge pattern for g <dig> . furthermore, the tertiary kunitz fold for each group representative does not structurally deviate much from each other . the deviation from the archetypal cys motif , however, has been shown to be functionally flexible  <cit> .

aligning a representative of each i. ricinus kunitz peptide group  in our study shows that specific residues coincide with the putative functions described by dai et al.  <cit> , classified as serine protease inhibitors or ion channel blockers/modulators. groups g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  however, do not contain these conserved residues . with the exception of the annotated i. scapularis sialome  <cit> , both protein blast  <cit>  and psi-blast  <cit>  searches do not reveal any known or functionally described single kunitz-domain peptide with the cys motif of g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  the proteins that slightly resemble the cys motif of g <dig>  and lack the archetypal cys <dig> and cys <dig> disulfide bridge, are the i. scapularis salivary kunitz proteins ixolaris  <cit>  and penthalaris  <cit> , both possessing multiple kunitz domains, and some members of the kunitz family found in r. microplus <cit> . an alignment using the classical kunitz serine protease inhibitor bpti  with g <dig> and g <dig> shows the conserved positively charged arginine  or lysine , known as the p <dig> site that interacts with the negatively charged active site of serine proteases . furthermore, the key residues for the ion channel blocker beta-bungarotoxin , from the venomous snake bungarus multicinctus <cit> , are also conserved in g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g8-g <dig> .

by organizing the kunitz peptides from the i. ricinus transcriptome into specific groups, we were also able to visualize specific profiles occurring in the transcript reads among the four independent cdna libraries, suggesting that there may be a correlation between the average transcript read value and putative function for each group. the three groups with the highest number of transcripts were g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> . figures 2a-c depicts the average illumina reads for all groups obtained from the i. ricinus transcriptome, complementing our functional predictions. we notice that three profiles are occurring among the organized transcripts encoding for kunitz peptides. figure 2a  shows that the average transcript read level  is low at the early stages of tick feeding for both nymphs  and adults  compared with the increased transcript reads during late feeding . soft ticks have a shorter feeding cycle than hard ticks and this phenomenon has been thoroughly explained by comparing the evolutionary divergence and emergence of serine protease inhibitors in hard ticks and soft ticks   <cit> . giving that hard ticks  feed on blood for longer periods of time  and that serine proteases are involved in blood coagulation and immune responses, we expect a higher transcript read encoding for serine protease inhibitors during late feeding stages as depicted in figure 2a .

we putatively classify g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g8-g <dig> as ion channel blockers and/or modulators  and as figure 2b shows they exhibit a separate profile than the serine protease inhibitors of figure 2a . these putative ion channel blockers/modulators show lower transcript reads during the nymphal stages of feeding , but the reads are increased in adult ticks during the early stage of blood feeding . the profile then decreases during the late stages of feeding . a possibility, as noted in mayfly nymphs sgs, for the expression of ion channel blockers/modulators in i. ricinus nymphs may partially be due to maintaining osmoregulatory function during molting  <cit> . to resist desiccation, tick nymphs rely on both water vapor and water retention, while adult ticks only rely on enhanced water retention  <cit> ; therefore, this may explain the increased transcript read encoding for ion channel blockers/modulators during adult feeding stages . in figure 2c we show that g <dig> deviates from the other two profiles, however, g <dig> and g <dig> have similar profiles to that of ion channel blockers/modulators . the distinct profile and cys motif g <dig> displays suggests that this group may belong to  a combination of serine protease inhibitors and ion channel blockers/modulators,  either serine protease inhibitors or ion channel blockers/modulators, or,  a completely new, undefined function – i.e., gene sharing .

the i. ricinus sg kunitz groups possess intra-cys residue variability, assemble into various secondary structure clusters, and vary in antigenicity and protein disorder
the aa positions with high variability  for the intra-cys residues of each group were calculated by the protein variability server  <cit>  using the shannon entropy equation   <cit>  are represented in figures 3a and d as the ratio of highly variable/highly conserved sites  and the average of aa variability  per group, respectively. on one hand, we consider g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> are “frozen” groups having low aa variability and high proportion of highly conserved sites. on the other hand, g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> are “melted” groups or highly variable. due to their low aa variability, the former assemblage may be considered highly adapted in the host-parasite interaction from a functional and/or immunological point of view. the second assemblage may still be under evolutive pressures that force aa variability.

to demonstrate the structural outcome of these “frozen” and “melted” clusters, we predicted the secondary structure for each kunitz peptide in all groups. we show that  <dig> models depict the variability of secondary structure among the  <dig> kunitz peptides  . five models in additional file  <dig>  are combined β-strand and α-helical secondary structure models, differing in length, amount and order of α-helices and β-strand, and describe  <dig> % of the secondary structure variation present in the i. ricinus kunitz/bpti family. all the groups contain different amounts of secondary structure models . it seems, however, that the secondary structure presented in ir2- <dig> and ir2- <dig> of g <dig> is the structural skeleton for the remaining secondary structures; these structures are also present in  <dig> of the  <dig> groups and explain 50% of the secondary structures. the fact that g <dig> represents the structural skeleton may be since its cys motif  is considered the ancestor of kunitz peptides in i. scapularis <cit> . structural convergence, however, has been reported for venoms, a general classification that the kunitz protein family belongs to .

when analyzing the aa variability  in relation to the secondary structure models per group  a high correlation is given ; however, by including g <dig> in this analysis the correlation decreases . this dictates that the aa variability per group is partly justifiable for structural reasons , except in g <dig>  figure 3c shows that ratio v/c or ave of aa variability are correlated, therefore, using v/c or ave of aa variability is interchangeable for figure 3e and f. the presence of different folds  suggests that gene sharing events may have occurred throughout the evolution of i. ricinus and may cause additional and unique functional properties. such moonlighting proteins may explain the diverse inhibitory effect of tick salivary kunitz peptides.

to elucidate additional molecular properties, we analyzed both the antigenic properties and protein disorder for all i. ricinus kunitz peptide groups in our study. our analysis reveals that the regional disorder was located at both termini for the majority of peptides . it is worth noting that antigenic properties involve the mobility of the c– and n-termini  <cit> . in figure 4a we show that g <dig> has the highest antigenicity mean . g <dig> has a “misplaced” cys <dig>  and lack of this cys <dig> is responsible for the functional flexibility of the kunitz-domain binding loop, that may permit target-specific interactions other than the catalytic domain of serine proteases  <cit> . we also notice that groups with only two sequences vary in antigenicity  that also coincides with differences in secondary structure . functional flexibility  is also demonstrated in g <dig>  since it has a higher variability in intrinsic protein disorder . intrinsically disordered regions  increase molecular recognition because of an ability to fold differently upon binding and possess large interacting surfaces  <cit> . interestingly, g <dig> has one sequence that is completely disordered  that is also highly antigenic .

the i. ricinus sg kunitz transcripts are under different selective pressures
the red queen hypothesis was proposed by van valen in  <dig>  <cit>  to explain the molecular evolution through evolutive interactions of prey–predator or host-parasite. the hypothesis establishes “that a proportional amount of successful response by one species produces a total negative effect on other species to maintain itself as before, the  species must increase its fitness ”. the i. ricinus sg kunitz encoding transcripts may adhere to the red queen hypothesis, where inverse selection  is a series of one species adapting  and the other counteradapting . to elucidate or validate the type of selective pressure  each i. ricinus kunitz peptide group has undergone throughout its evolution we used the synonymous non-synonymous analysis program   and datamonkey servers  <cit>  .

assuming that a ratio > <dig> between the non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per site  with the synonymous substitutions  is due to a positive selection and a ratio < <dig> is due to a purifying selection, we note in table  <dig> that the majority of groups are under a purifying selection. as we depict in figure 4c, only g <dig> had a strong correlation between disorder and antigenicity; coincidentally, g <dig> is the only group that has undergone positive selection . this correlation  suggests that the disorder in g <dig> may be under positive selection due to the immune system of the host, since protein mobility  may influence the antigenic properties of proteins  <cit> . our snap analysis, however, only displays the average of synonymous and the non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per site, therefore, is not to say that selection per site was not positive or negative for specific members of the remaining groups. we therefore used datamonkey to verify our snap analyses for evidence of positive selection and to determine which site along the nucleotide sequence are undergoing positive  or purifying  selection.

 from datamonkey slightly differ from that of snap. the datamonkey analyses show that g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> possess evidence for positive selection and note the type of selection for each site, using the slac algorithm . figure  <dig> graphically displays these results along the entire transcript, codon-by-codon . both g <dig> and g <dig> do not possess any sites under any selective pressure, while the remaining groups possess positive, negative  or both . as depicted in figure  <dig>  the majority of selected sites are negative  and groups g <dig> and g <dig> possess a few positively selected sites; however, there are more negatively selected sites for g <dig> and g <dig> than positively selected sites. in a recently published book, eugene koonin  <cit>  explains that purifying  selection, in some phases of evolution, is more common  than positive selection. koonin considers purifying selection is the default process of elimination of the unfit. with this regard we understand that kunitz-domain proteins – taking into account the number of members in general – should undergo a massive purifying selection in order to shape  the molecular diversity of this tick sg peptide family. additionally, as noted by the reduced gene duplications events in platypus venom compared with the massive gene expansions reported in cone snails and spiders  <cit> , selective pressures may fluctuate according to venom function.

the evolution of i. ricinus sg kunitz peptide groups
the phylogeny of the i. ricinus kunitz peptides from our study was reconstructed and divergence times were estimated. maximum likelihood  and bayesian phylogenetic methods resulted in similar tree topologies . four main clades containing  <dig> out of  <dig> i. ricinus kunitz peptide groups were well supported in the ml  and bayesian trees . the largest clade out of these four clades was composed of only kunitz peptides of prostriate ticks, namely from i. scapularis and i. ricinus groups g <dig>  g4- <dig>  g8- <dig> that we characterize as ion channel blockers/modulators. group g <dig> also appeared in this clade and, regarding its transcript read profile , g <dig> may also function as an ion channel blocker/modulator like the other kunitz members of that clade. although the maxik channel modulator ra-klp from r. appendiculatus did not group with the “ion channel blocker/modulator” clade, prostriate tick salivary proteins may completely function differently than metastriate tick proteins. thus, our characterization of g <dig>  g4- <dig>  g8- <dig> as ion channel blockers/modulators may still be valid and future experimental verifications will clarify this uncertainty.

the second largest clade also contained only prostriate kunitz peptides composed mainly of i. ricinus group g <dig>  as in the ion channel blocker/modulator clade, no functionally described kunitz appeared in this clade, therefore any possible function remains unknown. functionally described kunitz peptides were present in the remaining two largest clades. one of these clades was made up of only argasid kunitz peptides that included anti-platelet inhibitors. this group seem to evolved independently from hard ticks as previously postulated by mans et al.  <cit> , possibly due to different blood feeding behavior compared with hard ticks. the other clade mainly contained i. scapularis peptides together with i. ricinus group g <dig> and anti-clotting inhibitors of ornithodoros spp.. our aa sequence and structural analyses of g <dig> did not reveal any putative function for this i. ricinus group, although the transcript profile of g <dig> was similar to that of ion channel blockers/modulators . however, since g <dig> clusters with anti-clotting inhibitors and not with g <dig> may suggest a different function during tick feeding. i. ricinus groups g <dig> and g <dig> clustered together with hard and soft tick kunitz peptides, but their relationships are uncertain since they were not well supported in the ml and bayesian trees . nevertheless, in our bayesian analysis, i. ricinus groups g <dig> and g <dig> appeared with functionally described serine protease inhibitors and g <dig> proteins were also grouped together with g <dig> proteins in our ml analysis. both our phylogenetic and structural analyses of the i. ricinus groups g <dig> and g <dig>  suggests that these two groups may act as serine protease inhibitors. sk peptides appeared throughout the phylogram. some sks were similar in their aa sequence  with the other i. ricinus kunitz peptides assuming a similar function during blood feeding. others sks may be more functionally distinct, such as ir2-24967-sk, since it differs in its aa sequence from all other i. ricinus kunitz peptides.

our molecular clock analysis of tick and spider kunitz peptides recovered similar divergence times for the main splits of 1) spiders from ticks , 2) soft ticks from hard ticks  and 3) prostriate ticks within ixodidae  as calibrated for these taxon sets; the tree root was estimated as  <dig> mya  . most of these splits were well supported in the chronogram. metastriate kunitz peptides , however, started to evolve earlier than calibrated. nevertheless, this split is not well supported in the chronogram as previously stated . although i. scapularis homologs of i. ricinus group g <dig> kunitz peptides are considered to be the ancestral form of all kunitz-domain proteins  <cit> , our phylogenetic reconstructions of i. ricinus kunitz peptides cannot confirm these findings. even though g <dig> is not well supported in the ml and bayesian analyses, it can be assumed that this group of proteins evolved convergently in ticks as both phylogenetic trees indicate . expansion of protein families due to gene duplication events has been previously reported for ticks  <cit>  and can explain the convergent evolution of g <dig>  overall, the i. ricinus kunitz peptides in our molecular clock analysis underlie recent gene duplication events that explains how several members of the i. ricinus groups and other tick kunitz peptides do not strictly follow the calibrated divergence times within the taxon sets in the phylogenetic trees.

target-oriented evolution, a model for i. ricinus sg kunitz peptide evolution
the red queen hypothesis  <cit>  explains that host-parasites interactions must be characterized by constant mutations in both systems in order for parasites to efficiently infect the host and for the host to survive or avoid the parasitic attack. we understand the evolution of i. ricinus salivary kunitz family in this dynamic framework. in the following paragraphs we explain our basis to propose one model of target-oriented evolution for this family of proteins and briefly discuss our findings regarding the evolution of venomous proteins.

our model considers g <dig>  compared with all other i. ricinus kunitz peptide groups, as a cornerstone in understanding the kunitz family evolution of i. ricinus. firstly, members of g <dig> show unique molecular, structural and evolutive properties by possessing the highest amount of intra-cys residues between cys <dig> and cys <dig> , a distinct illumina read profile , a high aa variability , a higher number of different secondary structures , and an increased number of negatively selected sites . secondly, in the phylogenetic analysis, the clade formed by g <dig> is mainly composed of i. ricinus kunitz peptides , also representing the largest monophyletic clade suggesting a recent and specific evolution for this group in i. ricinus. thirdly, based on the molecular clock analysis g <dig> is the fastest evolving group, diverging about  <dig> mya ago and having the highest number of members. taking into account the time of divergence and the number of members, we should also consider g <dig> as an example of possessing an accelerated rate of evolution that has been reported for several other families of venomous proteins  <cit> . at this point we consider it important to make a distinction. as depicted in the phylogenetic tree  members of other groups appear to evolve around the same time point as g <dig>  it is crucial to note here that even when some genes show the same time of evolutive divergence, as they belong to a distinct group, they do have different functional states at the moment of divergence. for example, our tree depicts a clade containing members of g <dig> and g <dig> that diverged  <dig> mya ago , but, as we previously showed , these groups have different properties compared with g <dig>  in this way we consider that molecular mechanisms working for the observed kunitz family expansion  must be operating on the whole genome background, thus, functionally and structurally different gene may show genetic amplification at similar evolutive times. but we consider that the genetic expansion must be occurring at different rates for different groups of genes, depending on the function of the gene and its importance in the interaction with the host – as previously reported for venomous protein families  <cit> .

we consider that g <dig> is an important proof that tick salivary kunitz peptides possess a target-orientated evolution. by target-orientated evolution we mean the molecular properties that arise in the parasitic proteins through its interactions with the host targets and the host immune system that eventually determine its structural state. our model  takes into consideration that different groups are undergoing different evolutive pressures . this may explain, from a structural point of view, the evolution of the various functions found in the kunitz family. in the model, we propose three main evolutionary categories: “working”, “short-term” and “long-term” . the “working” group  contains an increased number of highly variable members and will eventually reduce its number of members and gain in molecular specialization due to immunological and functional constrictions. thus, becoming a variable but less flexible, “short-term” evolving group . the high variability found in g <dig> and g <dig> compared with g <dig> may be interpreted differently. non-monophyletic kunitz groups, like g <dig> and g <dig> may be remnants of variable-monophyletic groups, like g <dig>  that are evolutionarily static in expressed traits while accumulating genetic changes  <cit> . finally, evolution will lead to a “long-term” evolved group  that is less variable and highly specific in their molecular functions. immune and functional pressures will remain during the whole process of both differentiation and maintenance of a gained specificity. as we showed in table  <dig>  i. ricinus sg kunitz groups are evolving under different selective pressures and we predict they may have different functions . genes with different functions in venomous proteins families have been shown to evolve under different selective pressures  <cit>  and thus at a different rate of evolution. in this sense we do not claim the three categories of “working”, “short-term” and “long-term” as relatively exclusive to time, but we also refer them to a functional state .

CONCLUSIONS
the red queen hypothesis is an arms race proposed as a model for co-evolution for host-parasite interactions  <cit> . today’s increasing knowledge about the interface between host-tick interactions has provided insight that ticks successfully feed to repletion by counteracting the host immune response, platelet aggregation, inflammation and vasoconstriction  <cit> . we therefore infer that two main evolutionary pressures may be driving the evolution in i. ricinus kunitz peptides – i.e., immune response and the necessity of functional diversity against the diverse host molecular targets. the former is in agreement with specific immune response against tick salivary proteins  <cit> , and, specifically against kunitz members  <cit> . the pressure for functional diversity on tick kunitz peptides may be that several targets have been associated with their inhibitory activity such as trypsin, elastase, kallikrein  <cit> , chymotrypsin  <cit> , tissue factor complex inhibitor  <cit>  and ion channels  <cit> . we consider our model of target-oriented evolution  to explain the evolutionary dynamics found in the i. ricinus sg kunitz peptides in the framework of the red queen hypothesis.
