BACKGROUND
melon  is one of the most important vegetables worldwide. current world production of melon is over  <dig> million tons  <cit>  and is prevalently located in mediterranean and east asian countries. the intraspecific classification of c. melo has been revised several times. the most recent one  <cit>  includes two subspecies, melo and agrestis, and  <dig> groups or varietas: acidulous, chinensis, conomon, makuwa and momordica , and adana, ameri, cantalupensis, chandalak, chate, dudaim, flexuosus, inodorus, reticulatus and tibish . the groups cantalupensis and inodorus have the greatest commercial interest  <cit> .

the apulia region in southern italy is an important secondary centre of diversity for c. melo. besides several landraces of winter melon , the chate melon is still grown there as a last relic of a former wider cultivation in europe, and is known with the folk name of ‘carosello’  <cit> . its fruits, cylindric in shape and typically covered by long trichomes, are harvested unripen and used raw in replacement of cucumbers. laghetti et al.  <cit>  assigned another typical apulian vegetable production, referred to as ‘barattiere’, to the chate group. however, it is readily distinguishable from ‘carosello’ by its rounder shape and shorter trichomes. together, germplasm of ‘carosello’ and ‘barattiere’ is estimated to be cultivated over a modest area , and thus is seriously exposed to the risk of genetic erosion  <cit> .

the study of genetic diversity is of utmost importance to address conservation programmes contrasting the erosion of cultivated gene pools and to guide the use of germplasm in breeding. with the advent of next-generation sequencing , single nucleotide polymorphism  markers are commonly used to describe genetic diversity, as they are present in a large number and merge excellent attributes such as wide genomic distribution, high reproducibility and co-dominant inheritance. today, the genotyping-by-sequencing  assay is considered one of the most convenient approach for simultaneous large-scale snp discovery and genotyping  <cit>  and is widely employed to detect polymorphisms in plant species with sequence information  <cit> . there are no reports of the application of gbs in melon, although its genome is publicly available  <cit> .

here, we used a gbs approach for the genetic characterization of apulian germplasm of c. melo. besides local landraces of winter melon, several accessions of ‘carosello’ and ‘barattiere’ were included in the analysis, and were shown to form clearly distinct gene pools. in addition, snp data were used to provide information on linkage disequilibrium decay, to highlight regions putatively subjected to directional selection and to carry out a genome-wide association study .

RESULTS
library sequencing and snp calling
sequencing of a 72-plex gbs library yielded about  <dig> million good barcoded reads, corresponding to an average of  <dig>  million reads/sample. about 66% of the reads were successfully mapped onto the melon genome. the tassel-gbs pipeline  <cit>  yielded  <dig>  polymorphisms, supported by an average depth of  <dig>  about 50% of the snps fell in intergenic regions, 24% in introns, 20% in exons and 6% in utr regions. snps in the coding regions lead to  <dig> % of synonymous,  <dig> % of missense and  <dig> % of non-sense mutations. the observed transition/transvertion ratio was  <dig> . all the accessions contained less than 20% of missing data across the whole dataset of snp loci.

genetic structure
an admixture-based clustering model implemented in the software structure  <cit>  was used to infer the genetic structure of a germplasm collection representative of the genetic variation of c. melo cultivated in apulia . prior to analysis, biallelic snps were filtered with stringent parameters , resulting in  <dig>  high-quality polymorphisms scattered throughout the  <dig> c. melo pseudochromosomes present in the melon  <dig> . <dig>  genome assembly  <cit>  . moreover, as the model assumes independence of loci, the snp dataset was pruned on the basis of estimates of pairwise linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers. a model with three subpopulations   was the most suitable for the data, as inferred by the estimation of the Δk parameter  <cit>  . remarkably, the distribution of the accessions in the three subpopulations fully matched with the phenotypic classification in inodorus, ‘carosello’ and ‘barattiere’ . thus, the subpopulations were named i, c and b, respectively . about 15% of the accessions was classified of admixed ancestry, as the highest estimate of membership coefficient was lower than  <dig> . overall estimates of the pairwise fixation index  were  <dig>  between b and i ,  <dig>  between b and c  and  <dig>  between c and i .fig.  <dig> population structure analysis. results are shown for the minimum number of subpopulations  which sufficiently define genetic variation, as inferred by the estimation of the Δk parameter. each individual is represented by a vertical line, which is partitioned into coloured segments whose length depends on the estimated membership fraction  in each subpopulation. individuals are assigned to a specific subpopulation when the highest q is higher than  <dig>   genetic structure of the c. melo germplasm collection used in this study. the subpopulations i, c, and b, which refer to the types inodorus, ‘carosello’ and ‘barattiere’, respectively, are indicated. b genetic structure of the subpopulation i. the three subgroups are named y, g and s as they contain accessions with yellow, green and speckled fruit rind, respectively

genetic structure was also studied within each subpopulation. to this aim, the snp dataset was filtered separately for groups of accessions, resulting in the detection of  <dig>  polymorphisms in c,  <dig>  in i and  <dig>  in b. a model with k =  <dig> best explained stratification within i . each group included accessions with different fruit rind: yellow, green and speckled . a model with k =  <dig> was the most likely for c, however no correlation was found between each of the two groups and specific features of the accessions . finally, no stratification was detected by the analysis of the subpopulation b.

genetic relationships among individual accessions
principal component analysis  and neighbour-joining clustering were performed to identify patterns of genetic variation among individual accessions. genotypes of i, c and b formed three pca distinct groups, while admixed accessions were scattered at the center of the pca plot . further pcas were performed to understand genetic relationships within each subpopulation. pca within i revealed the occurrence of three groups, corresponding to accessions with yellow, green and speckled fruit rind . interestingly, the upper-right panel of the c pca plot contained all the accessions collected in the province of lecce, in the southern part of apulia . no clear correlation was found between pca patterns and specific features of b accessions .fig.  <dig> genetic relationships within the germplasm collection used in this study. a principal component analysis  plot. different colors represent accessions phenotypically classified as inodorus , ‘carosello’  and ‘barattiere’ . circles delimit groups corresponding to the subpopulations c, b and i identified by structure analysis  neighbour-joining cladogram. accessions assigned to the c, b and i subpopulations are highlighted . admixed accessions are indicated with dots. shaded areas indicate the i genetic clusters including accessions with green and speckled fruit rind and the c genetic cluster encompassing all the accessions collected in southern apulia




neighbour-joining clustering substantiated the results obtained with structure analysis and pca. three main nodes separated the subpopulations i, c and b. within i, two clusters enclosed accessions with green and speckled rind, respectively; within c, a cluster contained all the accessions collected in southern apulia .

ld decay
having shown that the c. melo germplasm collection used in this study is stratified in three distinct subpopulations, we decided to estimate ld decays for each of them separately . the fastest ld decay was displayed by the subpopulation c, as r <dig> reached the threshold of  <dig>  after  <dig> kb. conversely, the slowest decay was associated with the subpopulation i, in which the same threshold r <dig> value corresponded to a distance of 774 kb. the subpopulation b showed an intermediate behavior .fig.  <dig> average ld decay  estimated in the c. melo subpopulations c , b  and i 




genomic scan for selection signatures
we estimated the pairwise fixation index  parameter at individual snps, in order to identify loci putatively subjected to different selection pressures in the subpopulations i, c and b. fst approaches the upper limit of  <dig> when two subpopulations tend to fix opposite alleles. thirty-three highly divergent loci  were identified between the subpopulations c and i,  <dig> between c and b and  <dig> between b and i . two adjacent divergent loci on chromosome  <dig> , positioned within the putative hopm interactor  <dig> homolog melo3c006224t <dig>  define alleles which are private to the b group . similarly, the intergenic locus 5:27200654-snv on chromosome  <dig> defines an allele private to the i group  . several clusters of at least two consecutive markers displaying fst >  <dig>  were observed for all the pairwise comparisons:  <dig> between b and i,  <dig> between c and b and  <dig> between c and i . the largest cluster refers to the b vs i comparison and includes  <dig> loci spanning an interval of  <dig>  bp on chromosome  <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis of single-loci pairwise fst estimates among the subpopulations c, b and i. a genomic distribution of  <dig>  snp loci identified in this study in function of pairwise fst estimates. the horizontal line on each graph defines highly polymorphic loci associated with fst >  <dig>   venn diagram of highly polymorphic loci 




genome-wide association study
a gwas assay was performed to search for loci associated with the following morpho-agronomic traits: flowering time both for male and perfect flowers , seed length , seed width  and  <dig> seed weight . fltm was significantly associated with two snp loci, 2:689400-snv and 8:24132601-snv, on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the former is located within the gene melo3c <dig>  encoding a putative rubber elongation factor/small rubber particle protein , while the latter is located in an intergenic region. two significant associations were also found for sw , referable to the intergenic locus 2:19079933-snv, positioned on chromosome  <dig>  and the chromosome  <dig> locus 6:2464455-snv, located within the gene melo3c <dig> encoding a putative 60s ribosomal protein l13-a <dig> 

discussion
here we report the first application of gbs, a low-cost and high-throughput approach widely used to explore genetic diversity in cultivated species  <cit> , for the characterization of c. melo germplasm. more than 25k polymorphisms were detected, suggesting that gbs could be conveniently used in this species for further characterization of collections and other genomic studies.

structure analysis indicates that three clearly distinct subpopulations define the genetic variation of the c. melo germplasm cultivated in apulia, a secondary center of diversity in southern italy. these include accessions of winter melon and entries of morphotypes known with the folk names of ‘carosello’ and ‘barattiere’. the admixed accessions detected in this study, representing 15% of the collection, might originate from cross-pollination events during on-farm seed production, ultimately leading to genomic introgressions.

the chate melon has a centuries-old history of cultivation, starting at least from the ancient egypt  <cit> . in italy, it was presumably present already during the roman empire, although the first written documents indicating its cultivation date back to the middle age  <cit> . in contrast with its past wide distribution, today chate melons are found in a few local markets. this study, providing a first molecular characterization of the chate germplasm, might be of great interest to preserve this taxonomic group from genetic erosion. interestingly, pca and hierarchical clustering analyses indicate that patterns of genetic diversity of apulian chate melons also depend on their geographical origin, and this information could be conveniently used to orient germplasm conservation actions and breeding.

prior to this study, landraces known as ‘barattiere’, despite being morphologically distinct from those of ‘carosello’, were also assigned to the chate taxonomic varietas  <cit> . the results of this study question this notion, as the b and c subpopulation form clearly distinct genetic pools. moreover, the genetic distance between b and c  is higher than the distance observed between melons belonging to the different varietas
chate  and inodorus . possibly, the confusion between the two types arose from their common use as unripen fruits. it would be extremely interesting to compare, at the genomic level, ‘barattiere’ with all the intraspecific varietas reported for c. melo  <cit> . this might provide insights into the taxonomy of c. melo and its cultivation history.

the inodorus group is traditionally cultivated in southern italy, where it is appreciated for its long storability that allows consumption during the whole autumn and winter  <cit> . here, we show that the distribution of molecular diversity of inodorus accessions is associated with the rind phenotype. this finding is consistent with a previous cluster analysis carried out on spanish and eurasian germplasm  <cit> . yellow and green rind accessions collected in this study are morphologically similar to the spanish ‘amarillo’ and ‘tendral’ types, respectively. close genetic relationships between italian and spanish inodorus germplasm, which might be unveiled by future studies, are likely to occur as southern italy experienced a long spanish domination during the early modern period.

another aim of this work was to study the average ld decay in c. melo germplasm, an information of great importance for gwas. tomason et al.  <cit>  previously used genome-wide data for the quantification of average ld decay in c. melo. however, these authors pooled several taxonomic groups and used simple sequence repeat  markers, therefore their results are not comparable to those reported in this study. the subpopulation i displayed a much slower ld decay than c and b. this might be explained by the reasonable assumption that winter melon experienced a stronger anthropic selection pressure than ‘carosello’ and ‘barattiere’, which led to the fixation of a higher number of ld blocks. the slow ld decay in the inodorus group is ideal to identify markers associated with favourable traits, and thus assisted selection, as it allows for an efficient coverage of the genome with a relatively low number of markers. on the other hand, long ld blocks may represent a limiting factor when association studies are aimed to fine-map genes of interest.

an additional goal of this study was to detect putative selection signatures in the genome of the three c. melo subpopulations characterized by structure analysis. thus, several highly divergent snp loci were identified by the estimation of pairwise fst values. as we showed that ld decays at a low rate in c. melo, the chance is high that these loci are not the real targets of selection, but are rather in association with them. unfortunately, knowledge on the molecular basis underlying phenotypic variation in c. melo is still scarce. moreover, the b and c groups, which are of local commercial interest, lack a thoroughly phenotypic characterization. filling these gaps might thus help to associate high fst loci identified in this study with specific events of selection.

previous works successfully used populations of moderate size for gwas . therefore, we decided to use our germplasm collection for a medium-resolution association study, whose results might be integrated by further investigations taking into account larger samples and replicated trials. to reduce the amount of false-positives, we used a weighted mixed linear model  taking into account kinship and genetic structure , which was proven useful in gwas . moreover, to increase statistical stringency, we considered loci with high minimum allele frequency  and used the bonferroni correction. significant associations were detected for seed width and flowering time. these two traits are well-studied in plants, although little information is so far available in melon  <cit> . interestingly, a putative gid1c gibberellin receptor  maps 400kbp far from the marker 2:689400-snv, associated with fltm. in arabidopsis, gid <dig> homolog mutants are extremely late flowering under long-day conditions and fails to flower under short-day conditions  <cit> . in addition, a putative cleavage stimulation factor , whose mutation leads to late flowering in arabidopsis  <cit> , is located  <dig> kbp far from the locus 8:24132601-snv, also associated with fltm in this study. a candidate gene was also found for sw, as an homolog of the multicopy supressor of ira <dig>  gene , previously associated with seed development  <cit> , resides  <dig> kbp far from the snp locus 6:2464455-snv. functional studies targeting candidate genes identified in this study might prove their causal link with phenotypic variation in melon.

CONCLUSIONS
gbs was for the first time applied in c. melo. we provide useful information to understand the genetic structure of this species and to protect minor gene pools from genetic erosion. finally, our results might prompt molecular breeding approaches and be a resource for future studies aiming to link genomic variation with evolutionary and phenotypic traits.
