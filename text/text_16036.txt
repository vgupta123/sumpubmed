BACKGROUND
migraine is a neurological disease whose pathophysiological mechanisms are still incompletely understood. genetic research into rare monogenic forms of migraine such as familial hemiplegic migraine  has advanced our knowledge hinting at increased neuronal excitability as a major factor in disease etiology  <cit>  that may be applicable to common types of migraine as well. little is, however, known about the factors sensitizing patients to pain. it has been hypothesized that long-term alterations in trigeminal ganglion function may predispose a patient to subsequent attacks  <cit> . previous studies have produced a genetic mouse model that carries a missense r192q mutation in the α <dig> subunit of neuronal cav <dig>   ca2+ channels that causes familial hemiplegic migraine type  <dig>  in patients  <cit> . knock-in  mice carrying this mutation show channel gain-of-function with larger neuronal calcium influx, facilitated neurotransmitter release and lowered threshold for cortical spreading depression  <cit> , a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that underlies the migraine aura  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that trigeminal ganglion nociceptive neurons of r192q ki mice possess enhanced responses mediated by p2x <dig> receptors  <cit>  that are thought to be important neuronal transducers of pain signals  <cit> .

in mouse trigeminal ganglia in situ, the r192q mutation causes also changes in non-neuronal cells like satellite glial cells  <cit> . these experimental observations are in line with the theory of sterile inflammation that predicts, at meningeal level, local release of substances activating nociceptive sensory neurons as a possible mechanism for headache attack in migraine  <cit> . accordingly, trigeminal sensory fibers  would operate in an inflammatory milieu characterized by increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, and local oedema  <cit> . this process may establish a repeating cycle of headache attacks  <cit> . although this theory has been criticized  <cit> , there are no data firmly excluding neuroinflammation as a process to sensitize trigeminal sensory neurons.

macrophages are, in general, major players in inflammatory conditions as their responses to changes in the microenvironment can determine disease outcome  <cit> , and may even represent a therapeutic target to reverse or prevent pathological reactions. thus, the present study explored the possibility that macrophages may have a role in tissue sensitization like the one observed in certain chronic diseases  <cit> . in particular, the study aim was to test any crosstalk between macrophages and p2x <dig> receptor-expressing neurons  that might induce functional changes in single macrophage activity or in single neuron currents. to this end, using trigeminal ganglion cultures, experiments were performed by adding known numbers of host macrophages and examining the morphological and functional consequences.

methods
animals
cav <dig>  r192q knock-in  and wild-type  mouse littermates were used  <cit> . all experimental procedures were in strict accordance with the italian and eu regulation on animal welfare and were previously approved by the sissa ethics committee. mouse genotyping was performed as previously reported  <cit> .

culture procedure and protocol for macrophage-trigeminal ganglion co-cultures
trigeminal ganglion cultures were obtained from p12- <dig> mice as described before  <cit>  and, after  <dig> h from plating, employed for patch clamping, macrophage functional tests or molecular/cell biology experiments. from each mouse two ganglia were excised and used to prepare one petri dish. control and test cultures were always run in parallel on the same day.

to explore the potential interaction between macrophages and trigeminal ganglion cells, in a series of experiments, we supplemented standard trigeminal ganglion cultures with the addition of host macrophages. to this end, mouse host macrophages  were extracted from the peritoneal cavity of wt adult mice  <dig> h after a single intraperitoneal injection of brewer thioglycollate medium   <cit> . primary macrophages were plated in dmem/10% fbs medium and kept for  <dig> d in culture . thereafter, macrophages were collected, counted in a burker chamber, and transferred , for co-cultures experiments, to petri dishes containing trigeminal ganglia  dissociated on the same day. experiments were performed after  <dig> d of co-culturing. for the atp assay and fluoresbrite® yg latex microspheres experiments, we used multiwall plates in which an equivalent number of macrophages  were plated together with trigeminal neurons  for co-cultures experiments. we estimated that this addition increased the percent of macrophages from about 3– <dig> to 10–15% of the total dapi-positive cell population in a region of interest  of  <dig> ×  <dig> μm. it should be noted that, under the present experimental conditions, it was not possible to distinguish host macrophages from resident ganglion macrophages.

immunofluorescence microscopy
immunocytochemistry of trigeminal ganglia in culture from wt or r192q ki mice was performed as already described  <cit> . for immunocytochemistry of trigeminal ganglia in situ, a series of  <dig> μm-thick longitudinal sections of trigeminal ganglia was collected. the following antibodies were used: anti-β-tubulin iii  for neuronal staining, and anti-iba <dig> , a microglia/macrophage-specific marker of macrophage lineage in central and peripheral neuronal tissue  <cit> . for secondary immunostaining alexafluor goat-anti-mouse 488- or goat-anti-rabbit 594-conjugated antibodies  were used; nuclei were counterstained with dapi . images in a  <dig> ×  <dig> μm roi were visualized with a zeiss axioskop fluorescence microscope , and analyzed with either metamorph software  or imagej software  with itcn plugin. 3d reconstructions  of high magnification confocal images  of intact ganglia were obtained with imagej software and quantified with imagej voxel counter .

phagocytosis assay
macrophage phagocytosis tests were performed by incubating cultures with fitc-conjugated zymosan a  for  <dig> min at 37°c, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence  <cit> . active macrophages were considered when taking up ≥  <dig> granule of zy-fitc. after counting the average number of granules/active macrophage, the phagocytosis index was calculated as the percentage of zy-fitc-positive macrophages multiplied by the number of zy-fitc granules per single cell  <cit> . experiments were also performed with fluoresbrite® yg latex microspheres  on trigeminal neuronal cultures and macrophages co-cultures . fluorescence signals were detected with a perkin elmer fluorimeter at  <dig> nm wavelength. cumulative probability plots were constructed as shown before  <cit> .

real time - pcr and protein analysis
total mrna was extracted from cultures of wt or ki mouse peritoneal macrophages as described before  <cit> . real-time pcr reactions were run in duplicate in an iq <dig> thermocycler using iq sybr green supermix reactions , with specific primers for p2x <dig>  <cit>  or cav <dig>    <cit> . all primer sequences were designed using beacon designer  and were previously validated  <cit> . calculations for relative mrna transcript levels were performed using the comparative method between cycle thresholds of different reactions  <cit> . quantitative pcr was performed in duplicate following the miqe guidelines  <cit> .

western blotting was performed as described earlier  <cit> , using antibodies against anti-p2x <dig> , anti-β-tubulin iii  or anti-actin . grey values were quantified with scion image software  or uviband . total protein content of ganglia was measured with the bca kit purchased from sigma.

atp release assay
basal atp concentrations in the extracellular medium collected from  <dig> h trigeminal ganglion  cultures were measured with enliten atp assay , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. extracellular atp was also measured in the medium of macrophage-neuronal co-cultures following the addition of  <dig>  host macrophages /cm <dig> .

patch-clamp recording
p2x <dig> receptor-mediated currents were recorded, under patch clamping conditions in whole-cell configuration, from trigeminal neurons obtained from wt or r192q ki mice, using the specific agonist α,β-methylene-atp  applied with a fast superfusion system . full details of the electrophysiological methods have been previously reported  <cit> . trigeminal neurons were superfused continuously  with physiological solution containing :  <dig> nacl,  <dig> kcl,  <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig> glucose, and  <dig> hepes . patch pipettes  were filled with the following solution :  <dig> kcl,  <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> mg2atp <dig>   <dig> gtp,  <dig> hepes, and  <dig> egta . cells were held at − <dig> mv. data were filtered at  <dig> khz and acquired by means of a digidata 132xinterface and pclamp  <dig>  software . we measured current peak amplitude, current rise-time , onset of desensitization , and recovery from desensitization . recovery was expressed as % of the first response in each pair  <cit> .

to find out how wt p2x <dig> receptor currents might have been affected by the number of host macrophages, we compared current amplitudes after adding  <dig>  or  <dig>  or  <dig> million mФ for  <dig> h to the primary ganglion cultures. under these conditions, while control wt currents had an average amplitude of − <dig> ±  <dig> pa , co-culturing with  <dig>  host macrophages raised the average amplitude of p2x <dig> currents to − <dig> ±  <dig> pa . larger macrophage numbers  led to current amplitudes of − <dig> ±  <dig>  or − <dig> ±  <dig> pa , values that were not significantly different from the one observed with  <dig>  macrophages. hence, further experimental tests were routinely carried out with  <dig>  host macrophages.

statistics
data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean , where n indicates the number of independent experiments or the number of investigated cells. statistical analysis was performed using the student’s t-test, or the mann–whitney rank sum test after the software-directed choice of parametric or non-parametric data, respectively . a p value of ≤  <dig>  was accepted as indicative of a statistically significant difference.

RESULTS
strong phagocytotic activity of ki macrophages in vitro
similar observations were obtained from sections of acutely-excised trigeminal ganglia. thus, iba <dig> immunoreactivity was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % /area for ki trigeminal ganglion sections vs  <dig>  ±  <dig> % /area for wt sections . it is important to note that satellite glial cells are iba <dig> negative in trigeminal ganglia  <cit> . confocal microscopy analysis of trigeminal ganglion slices immunostained for iba <dig> revealed that macrophages of ki ganglia in situ displayed, on average, a significantly  larger cell volume  vs wt , since they acquired an amoeboid morphology with limited number of processes, suggesting a change in their activation state, as found in vitro.

co-culturing trigeminal ganglia with exogenous macrophages
it seemed interesting to find out whether the neuroinflammatory profile of r192q ki cultures could be increased by adding activated macrophages because one theory proposes that, during an acute migraine attack, there is a sterile inflammation of meninges with strong appearance of inflammatory cells like macrophages  <cit> .

to investigate this issue with an in vitro model, peritoneal macrophages  harvested from mice previously injected with brewer thioglycollate medium were co-cultured with trigeminal ganglia. while the house keeping gene gapdh or actin was clearly expressed in peritoneal macrophage samples, rt- pcr data for cav <dig>  showed no detectable signal in wt or ki mouse peritoneal macrophages . adding equivalent numbers  of purified mФ  to wt or ki cultures led,  <dig> h later, to a larger global number of iba1-positive cells in ki cultures , without change in the mrna or protein expression of p2x <dig> receptor subunits .

the basal activation state of macrophages was next evaluated in functional terms by using the phagocytosis test  <cit>  calculated for the uptake of zy-fitc granules added to the culture medium for  <dig> min. figure 2a shows an example of images in which there was higher basal macrophage activation in r192q ki than wt culture, consistent with the larger area of this cell type . on average, r192q ki macrophages had more zy-fitc granules/active macrophage  than wt macrophages  . in accordance with färber et al.  <cit> , macrophage activity was expressed as phagocytosis index that was, on average,  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> for wt and r192q ki cultures, respectively . cumulative probability plots to find out the occurrence of granule uptake in wt and r192q ki cells are shown in figure 2d in which the higher probability of detecting a larger number of granules was clearly assigned to r192q ki cells, regardless of the actual number of granules. these data, therefore, provided a functional validation of higher constitutive macrophage activity in r192q ki ganglion culture. basal phagocytotic activity was detected in  <dig> ± 5% host mФ with an average value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  granules/active macrophage . these data were further validated by performing an uptake assay using inert fluorescent latex beads  that provided very similar results. 

we explored whether co-culturing mФ with trigeminal ganglia might change macrophage phagocytosis activity at single cell level. thus, figure 2b shows that the number of granules taken up by single macrophages was larger in wt-macrophages co-cultures vs standard wt cultures. the same observation was obtained when comparing r192q ki -macrophages co-cultures with r192q ki cultures . thus, these observations enabled us to calculate the phagocytosis index that, for wt co-cultures, rose to  <dig> ±  <dig>  a result similar to the one for ki co-cultures , suggesting that in both conditions a similar, strong functional activity was reached by adding macrophages. the next issue to be studied was whether macrophages could be divided into different cell clusters in terms of their phagocytotic activity, or whether there was a continuum of granule uptake process. this question was addressed as shown in figure 2e that depicts cumulative plots for granule uptake process by host macrophages alone, or co-cultured with wt or r192q ki cells, demonstrating that, in either type of co-culture, there was equal probability for analogous granule uptake. thus, the different probability shown in figure 2d was lost following co-culturing conditions , indicating that, when tested under co-culturing conditions, the granule uptake by single macrophages was always enhanced.

p2x <dig> receptor-mediated responses in the presence of host macrophages
a range of extracellular soluble factors, including atp itself, might have been implicated in the crosstalk between sensory neurons and macrophages  <cit> . hence, we measured basal atp concentrations in wt or ki trigeminal cultures, and detected a higher level of atp in the ki culture medium vs. the wt one . furthermore, we investigated the impact  of adding macrophages on atp release by ki and wt trigeminal cultures. figure 3d shows that, while wt neuronal-macrophage co-cultures did not show significantly different atp levels from control , ki + mФ co-cultures released significantly more atp .

discussion
the principal finding of our study is that macrophages and sensory ganglion neurons could crosstalk with mutual facilitation of their functional activity. since this process was observed in culture, it suggests that such an interaction may occur even without the intervention of blood-borne substances or cells.

basal macrophage profile of ganglion cultures
notwithstanding the limitations of using a simple culture model, the present reports attempts to fill a gap between two distinct sets of data concerning the basic pathophysiology of migraine pain. on the one hand, the proposal of sterile inflammation predicts, at least in coincidence with the headache attack, the activation of inflammatory cells, among which macrophages are likely to play a major role  <cit> , as contributors to sensitize nociceptive neurons via local release of substances  <cit> . this theory, however, does not clarify if a neuroinflammatory profile lingers in the absence of attack, if it may predispose to it, and what soluble mediators might trigger it.

on the other hand, the r192q ki mouse model expressing a dysfunctional channelopathy affecting a certain class of neuronal ca2+ channels, suggests a neuronal origin of migraine pain  <cit> , but it does not fully identifies the mechanisms responsible for the actual pain onset or whether a causative role for non-neuronal cells is mandatory.

the present data suggest that r192q ki ganglia and cultures constitutively contained a significantly larger number of macrophages with typical morphology of activation in comparison with wt cultures. despite the fact that iba- <dig> negative satellite glial cells have a key role in neuronal-glial crosstalk in trigeminal ganglia  <cit> , the iba <dig> positive cells investigated in the present report appeared to be a potential, new contributor to sensory neuron modulation even if they were a small minority in the global ganglion cell population. this notion was supported by the stronger phagocytosis index of such cultures. we propose that r192q ki trigeminal ganglion cultures basally possessed an intrinsic milieu that predisposed macrophage activation, even if future work is necessary to identify the molecular mechanisms. a parsimonious hypothesis would be that the enhanced excitability of r192q ki neurons detected even in vitro <cit>  was instrumental in determining the macrophage activation perhaps via release of soluble factors. to further test the potential crosstalk between neurons and macrophages, we performed experiments by adding exogenous macrophages to cultures, and observing the functional outcome.

co-culturing peritoneal macrophages and trigeminal sensory ganglia stimulated phagocytosis
purified peritoneal macrophages had, on average, the same phagocytic activity of macrophages resident in wt trigeminal ganglion cultures. co-culturing peritoneal macrophages with trigeminal ganglion cultures significantly enhanced the macrophage activity at single cell level, suggesting that either through macrophage mutual interaction or neuronal influence, single macrophages had acquired stronger function. this phenomenon was similarly detected with wt or r192q ki co-cultures, suggesting that a specific neuronal phenotype was not necessary to potentiate macrophage activity at single cell level. importantly, peritoneal macrophages did not express cav <dig>  channels, thus making unlikely the possibility of a different contribution by wt or ki macrophages per se, once added to cultures. it is noteworthy that, even after co-culturing, the relative percentage of macrophages with respect to the total cell population was only 10–15%, suggesting that there was no large unbalance of cell types following co-culturing. using the co-culturing protocol, granule uptake reached a plateau value within the time-course of our experimental observations.

influence of macrophages on neuronal responses mediated by p2x <dig> receptors
under basal conditions, the higher number of macrophages of r192q ki cultures had no effect on p2x <dig> receptor expression levels, even though p2x <dig> receptor responses were constitutively larger.

the co-culturing protocol significantly increased the responses of wt receptors that grew in amplitude to the constitutive level expressed by r192q ki receptors. wt p2x <dig> receptors in co-culture, however, recovered less promptly from desensitization: the cause for this difference remains unclear, but it might be related to the action of yet unidentified soluble factors that may selectively affect certain phases of receptor desensitization  <cit> . it seemed feasible that, in the microenvironment generated by co-culturing macrophages with trigeminal ganglia, one contributor to the observed responses was ambient atp  <cit>  for this purpose, we measured extracellular atp whose basal levels were rather small , yet significantly higher in ki cultures, a phenomenon even more evident in macrophages co-cultures. these data should, however, be interpreted with caution as endogenously-released compounds are strongly diluted in the large extracellular space of the cultures and are subjected to enzymatic breakdown and/or cell transport. thus, the effective concentration of atp at cell membrane level remains unknown. notwithstanding these important limitations, it is plausible to assume that ambient atp could modulate p2x <dig> receptor responsiveness via high affinity desensitization and trap a few receptors in a desensitized state with minimal influence on current peak  <cit> . this possibility would not readily explain macrophage-mediated enhancement of p2x <dig> receptor currents, in particular in wt neurons. a more likely explanation that, however, requires future investigation is that any effect by ambient atp was indirectly generated via activation of highly sensitive p2y receptors expressed by satellite glial cells that can shape p2x <dig> receptor function in trigeminal culture  <cit> . furthermore, it is well established that extracellular atp is not the only molecule that can modify p2x <dig> receptor kinetic properties and trigeminal neuronal responses  <cit> . thus, it is hypothesized that atp-evoked release of other soluble mediators  might have contributed to the observed effects.

the strong p2x <dig> responses generated by r192q ki trigeminal ganglion neurons were not further augmented by co-culturing, indicating likely saturation of this process. in support of this notion, adding larger numbers of macrophages did not increment wt p2x <dig> receptor currents beyond the level observed in r192q ki neurons. likewise, there was no change in receptor desensitization properties which, in r192q ki neurons, are regulated by a complex balance between intracellular kinases and phosphatases controlled by soluble extracellular factors  <cit> .

we surmise that, for r192q ki neurons, constitutive macrophages could contribute to potentiated responses mediated by p2x <dig> receptors, and that no further enhancement was seen merely by raising macrophage numbers.

CONCLUSIONS
assuming that the present data might be applicable to the in vivo condition, one can hypothesize that the larger macrophage population might create a local milieu that predisposes to the onset of p2x <dig> receptor mediated pain. hence, macrophages and, probably, other inflammatory cells might together with satellite glial cells  <cit>  concur to shift trigeminal neuronal sensitivity to a hyperfunctional state in a genetic model of migraine.
