BACKGROUND
cell death is an essential and integral aspect of embryonic development . the genome is programmed to eliminate certain cells or groups of cells at particular times during development by a process called "programmed cell death"   <cit> . well-known examples of pcd during vertebrate development include interdigital cell death and regression of the tail and gills during amphibian metamorphosis  <cit> . considerable pcd also occurs in the central nervous system , where as much as 85% of some neuronal populations may be lost by pcd during development  <cit> . one form of pcd is apoptosis, which is characterized by membrane blebbing, nuclear and cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation and dna fragmentation  <cit> . the detection of dna fragmentation in dying cells utilizing the tunel  assay provides the basis for a sensitive and specific in situ measure of apoptosis.

the frog xenopus laevis provides an excellent model system for studying apoptosis during embryonic development. the tunel assay has been used on whole-mounts and tissue sections of xenopus embryos to monitor spontaneous developmental apoptosis  <cit> . apoptosis also provides the means for the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by dna-damaging agents, such as gamma radiation  <cit> . gamma radiation during embryonic development is a threat to the viability of the embryo and to its potential to develop into a healthy, functional adult organism. embryos have two alternative mechanisms to prevent developmental abnormalities caused by irradiation: elimination of damaged cells through apoptosis or repair of the damaged dna. xenopus embryos undergo a dramatic transition in their response to ionizing radiation coincident with the onset of gastrulation. embryos irradiated before gastrulation continue to cleave normally and undergo an abrupt, catastrophic, comprehensive and synchronous apoptosis of dna-damaged cells after the mid-blastula transition  using a maternally-derived mechanism that does not require transcription  <cit> . in contrast, cells in embryos irradiated after gastrulation reportedly do not undergo apoptosis  <cit> .

the induction of apoptosis is subject to both pro- and anti-apoptotic cellular factors and is executed by cysteine proteases called caspases after their activation from the proenzyme state. the activation of caspases can be triggered by cytochrome c release from the intermembrane spaces of mitochondria through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization  <cit> . release of cytochrome c, in turn, is regulated by members of the bcl- <dig> family . members of the bcl- <dig> family serve a key regulatory role in apoptosis, acting as either pro- or anti-apoptotic factors. thus, the relative levels of members with opposing functions can determine whether cells live or die  <cit>  . one of the anti-apoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> family is bcl-xl, which functions to inhibit apoptosis in situations in which bcl- <dig> does not suffice  <cit> . for example, bcl- <dig> knockout mice are viable as embryos  <cit>  whereas bcl-xl knockout mice die as embryos that exhibit massive cell death in the nervous and hematopoietic systems  <cit> . over-expression studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo in mice indicate that bcl-xl is also sufficient to promote survival of embryonic neurons  <cit> . similar results have been obtained with chick embryonic neurons in vitro  <cit> . members of the bcl family also modulate the apoptogenic effects of dna-damaging agents. for example, lymphoid cells from bcl- <dig> null mice are hypersensitive to irradiation in vitro  <cit> . conversely, over-expression of bcl- <dig> reduces the rate of apoptosis of γ-irradiated hematopoietic cells both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

cruz-reyes and tata  <cit> cloned two bcl-related genes in xenopus laevis, which they designated as xr <dig> and xr <dig>  xr <dig> , which most closely resembles bcl-xl, is expressed as early as stage  <dig>  and continues to be expressed throughout embryonic, larval and adult life. over-expression of xr <dig> in rat- <dig> fibroblasts protected the cells from apoptosis, thus demonstrating that xr <dig> is an anti-apoptotic member of the bcl family. misexpression of human bcl- <dig> or xr <dig> in xenopus embryos has been shown to impede developmental- or chemically-induced apoptosis, respectively, during early xenopus laevis embryonic development  <cit> . the transgenesis technique developed by kroll and amaya  <cit>  provides the means to study the effects of genes on later developmental events and to examine the effects of the transgenes on subsequent generations. for example, coen et al.  <cit>  employed a neuron-specific promoter driving xr <dig> over-expression to demonstrate selective protection of rohon-beard cells during metamorphosis. in this report, we have used a constitutive promoter to examine the effects of generalized xr <dig> over-expression throughout xenopus development and to examine the respective roles of maternal and zygotic xr <dig> in protection against γ-radiation-induced apoptosis during development.

RESULTS
over-expression of xr <dig> dramatically reduced spontaneous developmental apoptosis in embryos
over-expression of xr <dig> in nuclear transplant embryos was achieved by utilizing a plasmid containing colinear cmvxr <dig> and cargfp genes. cmv is a strong constitutive promoter in xenopus, whereas xcar promotes gene expression in muscle and cardiac tissue. thus, xr <dig> should be expressed universally, whereas expression of the colinear gfp reporter gene in muscle and heart was used to select xr <dig> transgenics. to determine whether the over-expression of xr <dig> protected embryonic cells from apoptosis, we compared the incidence of tunel-positive nuclei between xr <dig> and control transgenic whole-mount and sectioned tailbud-stage embryos. yeo and gautier  <cit>  demonstrated that the tunel assay is effective and specific for detecting apoptosis in xenopus embryos. examination of control whole-mount tailbud-stage embryos  showed that darkly labelled apoptotic nuclei are particularly prevalent in the heads, whereas xr <dig> transgenics  exhibited little or no detectable apoptosis. examination of cross-sections  revealed that tunel-positive nuclei were most prevalent in the retinas and brains, whereas xr <dig> transgenic embryos lack tunel-positive nuclei. counts of total tunel-positive nuclei in sections were made at stages  <dig>  33/ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in gfp controls, tunel-positive cells peaked at stage 33/ <dig>  whereas xr <dig> overexpressing embryos had nominal numbers of tunel-positive nuclei at all stages. for example, over-expression of xr <dig> at stage 33/ <dig> reduced apoptosis by 95%. student's t-tests indicate that the differences in the numbers of tunel-positive nuclei between the xr <dig> and gfp embryos are highly significant .

over-expression of xr <dig> did not impede apoptosis that occurs during normal or thyroid hormone-induced metamorphosis
if pro-apoptotic factors facilitate apoptosis during metamorphosis of tadpoles into frogs, we would expect over-expression of the anti-apoptotic xr <dig> to impede metamorphosis. however, xr <dig> transgenic tadpoles developed as apparently normal larvae that underwent metamorphosis, losing their transient larval structures, such as gills and tails . the loss of gills is evident by the slimming of the body profile in the pharyngeal region . the remnant of the tail is indicated by the arrow in b. loss of these structures occurs via apoptosis during metamorphosis in response to thyroid hormone  <cit> .

to address more specifically whether apoptosis can be triggered by thyroid hormone in xr <dig> transgenics, we used the metamorphosis induction assay described by tata  <cit>  and huang et al.  <cit> . one-week tadpoles were exposed to triiodothyronine  for five days. as shown in figure 3c–j, tadpoles transgenic for xr <dig> displayed the same gross responses to thyroid hormone, including gill resorption, as shown by the gfp transgenics with no discernable delay. the gill apparatus, which is visible in the absence of t <dig> , regresses after t <dig> treatment in both cases. meckel's cartilage  shows a dramatic beak-like reshaping .

to determine whether apoptosis was occurring equally in the gfp and xr <dig> transgenic tadpoles, we focused on the ventral velum, a portion of the larval filter feeding apparatus that has a chevron shape in cross section before it dissociates through apoptosis during metamorphosis  <cit> . as shown in figure 3k–r, tunel-positive nuclei, which are rare in the velums in the absence of t <dig>  were prevalent in the velums of both t3-treated gfp and xr <dig> transgenic tadpoles. these results indicate that apoptosis that occurred in response to thyroid hormone was unaffected by over-expression of xr <dig>  one possible explanation for the extensive apoptosis in the xr <dig> transgenic tadpoles is that the xr <dig> protein was no longer over-expressed. however, as shown in figure 3s, immunoblotting with an antibody to xr <dig> confirmed that the  <dig> kda xr <dig> protein was over-expressed in the transgenic tadpoles. proteins were extracted from individual tadpoles at approximately stage  <dig>  separated by electrophoresis, blotted and probed as described in methods. these tadpoles had been treated with triiodothyronine . similar results were obtained with samples from untreated tadpoles . the variation in the gfp signal reflected the intensity of gfp fluorescence in the live tadpoles, presumably reflecting differences in the number of integrated copies of gfp. the  <dig> kda xr <dig> signal is considerably stronger in the xr <dig> transgenic sample than in the gfp transgenic sample, reflecting xr <dig> transgene expression.

xr <dig> transgenic frogs are fertile and transmit the transgene
the failure of xr <dig> over-expression to prevent metamorphosis enabled us to rear the resultant frogs to sexual maturity. we induced ovulation in adult females and used the sperm from adult males to obtain second-generation embryos overexpressing xr <dig>  the results of representative crosses are shown in table  <dig>  individual parents were designated by number . crossing the xr11- <dig> male with a wild-type female gave a 1: <dig> ratio of transgene positive to transgene negative progeny, suggesting that his genome had integrated the transgene at a single site. crossing him with the xr11- <dig> female gave a 3: <dig> ratio, a result consistent with a single transgene integration site. however, crossing him with the xr11- <dig> female yielded a 7: <dig> ratio, suggesting that this female had two transgene integration sites.

over-expression of xr <dig> curtailed apoptosis induced by irradiation
the ability to produce second-generation transgenics gave us the opportunity to compare the effects of maternal and zygotic expression of the xr <dig> transgene on susceptibility of embryos to γ-radiation-induced apoptosis. consistent with the literature  <cit> , wild-type embryos subjected to -radiation before the mbt did not undergo apoptosis before the mbt . the appearance of tunel-positive nuclei was delayed until after the mbt and was radiation dosage-dependent . after exposure to  <dig> gy  blastopores were not evident, and large sectors containing tunel-positive nuclei were seen. more extensive damage was seen after exposure to  <dig> gy . tunel-positive nuclei were pervasive. dissociation of the embryos was so extensive that the embryos often fragmented during the tunel procedure.

in contrast to the results with wild-type embryos, embryos produced by fertilization of eggs from xr <dig> females with wild-type sperm showed evidence of partial protection from γ-radiation . reduced damage from radiation was always observed after exposure to  <dig> gy, but protection from  <dig> gy was variable from experiment to experiment, suggesting that overexpression of xr <dig> was not always sufficient to overcome the effects of  <dig> gy.

to investigate whether protection from radiation-induced damage was due to maternal or zygotic expression of the transgene, we irradiated embryos derived from fertilizing eggs of wild-type females with sperm from xr <dig> males and compared them to wild-type embryos. if zygotic expression of the transgene could partially overcome the effects of pre-mbt γ-radiation, we would have expected to see a subset of embryos with few or no tunel-positive nuclei that resembled embryos derived from eggs of xr <dig> females. instead, all embryos resembled irradiated wild-type embryos . extensive tunel-positive nuclei are seen in both groups at both doses. furthermore, the embryos exposed to  <dig> gy fragmented during the tunel procedure. these results are consistent with a requirement for a maternal source of radiation protection at these early stages.

according to the literature, embryos irradiated after the mbt do not undergo apoptosis  <cit> . indeed, embryos that were irradiated after the mbt  and examined  <dig> hours later did not show outward signs of radiation damage . however, tunel assays showed that irradiation enhanced apoptosis in wild-type embryos, predominantly in the brain, eyes, pharynx and tail bud. hence, we sought to determine whether the maternal effect of the xr <dig> transgene was sustained after the mbt and whether zygotic expression of the transgene could also confer radiation tolerance. to do this, we segregated the xr <dig> transgenic embryos of over-expressing xr <dig> females from their non-transgenic siblings based upon their expression of the gfp reporter gene under control of the cardiac actin promoter. the gfp negative  embryos had maternal expression of the xr <dig> transgene but no zygotic expression, whereas the gfp positive  embryos had both maternal and zygotic xr <dig> transgene expression. results show that maternal expression of the xr <dig> transgene protected embryos irradiated at stage  <dig>  even if they did not express zygotic xr <dig>  as shown in figure 5a–f, neither the gfp- nor the gfp+ embryos had extensive apoptosis after irradiation, although some gfp- embryos demonstrated some apoptosis in the hindbrain region, but not in the tail tip . when embryos were irradiated during the mid- <dig> stages  and examined  <dig> hours later, the protection afforded by maternal expression of xr <dig> had diminished significantly in the head and pharynx, although the tail tips were still protected . however, zygotic expression of xr <dig> was very effective in conferring global protection from apoptosis .

to examine the effects of zygotic xr <dig> transgene expression in the absence of maternal expression, we irradiated stage  <dig>  embryos derived from fertilizing eggs from wild-type females with sperm from xr <dig> males. progeny were scored  <dig> hours later for gfp expression directed by the cardiac actin promoter to confirm the presence of the transgene. as shown in figure 6a–f, there was extensive apoptosis in both the heads, pharynges and tail tips of irradiated neurula-stage embryos and no discernable difference in the levels of apoptosis observed between the gfp-positive and gfp-negative embryos. embryos that received  <dig> gy radiation  are stunted with blunt heads, indicative of extensive developmental defects. these results suggest that zygotic expression of the transgene had little effect in preventing apoptosis at this stage. however, when sibling embryos were irradiated in the mid- <dig> stages and examined  <dig> hours later, the transgene conferred global protection from apoptosis . note particularly the extensive apoptosis that is evident in the otic capsules  of irradiated embryos lacking the transgene .

the tunel data presented above indicate that:  maternal expression of the xr <dig> transgene reduces the amount of apoptosis induced by γ-radiation during pre-mbt and early post-mbt stages,  protection from apoptosis by maternal transgene expression is sustained in the tail tip after tissues in the head become susceptible to apoptosis  and  radiation tolerance is acquired gradually after the mbt and is sufficient to provide complete protection from apoptosis to embryos irradiated in the mid- <dig> stages of development.

to correlate transgene expression with repression of radiation-induced apoptosis, we monitored xr <dig> rna expression and protein levels . expression of xr <dig> at the rna level in embryos was monitored by rt-pcr with primers designed against the xr <dig> sequence. rt-pcr was performed on first strand cdna synthesized from rna isolated from pre-mbt  and post mbt  wild-type embryos and embryos derived from fertilizing eggs of two different xr <dig> females with wild-type sperm and the fertilization of wild-type eggs with xr <dig> sperm. as shown in figure 7a, we observed maternal xr <dig> transcripts in pre-mbt embryos derived from transgenic females. on the contrary, there was no evidence for expression of the xr <dig> transgene in embryos derived from wild-type eggs fertilized by xr <dig> sperm. after the mbt, xr <dig> mrna derived from both maternal and paternal transgenes was evident. immunoblots  indicated the presence of maternally-derived xr <dig> protein and the accumulation of xr <dig> protein from either maternal or paternal transgene expression after the mbt.

discussion
the application of technology to modify xenopus genetically has created opportunities to conduct functional analyses that are not readily achieved by other means. in this study, we have used xr <dig> transgenics to examine the role of bcl-xl in suppressing apoptosis during embryonic development, thyroid-hormone-induced metamorphosis and in response to γ-radiation. our ability to raise xr <dig> transgenic frogs to maturity has also given us the opportunity to distinguish between maternal and zygotic contributions of bcl-xl to radiation protection.

this study supports the growing evidence in the literature that bcl-xl is sufficient to promote neuronal survival in mice and chicken embryos  <cit> . our experiments showed that the xr <dig> transgene could eliminate most apoptosis in the developing xenopus nervous system, including the brain and eyes. this result is consistent with a model in which the execution of developmental apoptosis is dependent upon a balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic factors with bcl-xl being one of the anti-apoptotic factors. in spite of the abatement of developmental apoptosis in xr <dig> transgenic embryos, there were no apparent gross developmental consequences; the embryos developed into phenotypically normal tadpoles. this result suggests that developmental apoptosis is not essential for development of vital organ systems, notably the central nervous system, and that embryos can adapt to an overabundance of neurons. however, detailed morphometric studies would be necessary to confirm this conclusion. yeo and gautier  <cit>  previously showed that injection of human bcl- <dig> mrna abrogated programmed cell death during early xenopus development, resulting in an expansion of neural tissue and variations in the patterns of expression of a number of genes expressed during early neurogenesis. we did not examine gene expression patterns in our embryos. however, if such alterations did occur, they had no apparent functional consequences.

contrary to expectation, metamorphosis of xr <dig> transgenic tadpoles was normal, as was the response to exogenous thyroid hormone. if over-expression of bcl-xl had hindered metamorphosis, it would have indicated that thyroid hormone triggers apoptosis by shifting the balance between pro-apoptotic factors and bcl-xl. however, this proved not to be the case, even though we found that bcl-xl was still misexpressed at metamorphosis. one possibility is that other members of the bcl- <dig> family counter apoptosis during these later stages. another possibility for the failure of xr <dig> transgenesis to prevent apoptosis during metamorphosis is that expression of the transgene was insufficient to shift the balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic factors sufficiently to prevent apoptosis. it is also possible that subtle changes in the timing, rate or cellular selectivity of metamorphosis did occur that we failed to detect. for example, coen et al.  <cit>  demonstrated selective protection of rohon-beard neurons in xr <dig> over-expressing tadpoles during metamorphosis. we did not assess cell-specific neoronal survival during metamorphosis.

upon reaching sexual maturity, both male and female frogs were fertile. crosses of transgenic frogs indicated that most had small numbers of transgene integration sites. this result was consistent with a previous transgene transmission study  <cit> . the ability to produce second generation transgenic xr <dig> embryos provided us with the opportunity to examine both the maternal and zygotic contributions of bcl-xl to the apoptotic response to γ-radiation. this provided evidence for a significant role for apoptotic factor balance in determining whether cells that had received damaging dosages of radiation during development were eliminated. other bcl- <dig> family members may carry out similar roles in that microinjection of human bcl- <dig> mrna into xenopus embryos is effective in inhibiting irradiation-induced apoptosis  <cit> .

expression of the xr <dig> transgene had a profound effect on whether cells of irradiated embryos underwent apoptosis. furthermore, the application of transgenics allowed us to demonstrate that this effect depended upon the source of the over-expressed protein. over-expression of bcl-xl derived from xr <dig> females provided partial protection from the normal massive apoptosis that occurs in irradiated pre-mbt wild-type embryos after reaching the mbt. however, if the xr <dig> gene was derived from xr <dig> males, no protection was seen. this result demonstrates conclusively that apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the mbt can be restrained by maternal expression of bcl-xl and that zygotic expression of bcl-xl is ineffective in overcoming the effects of prior irradiation.

irradiation soon after the mbt  had much more subtle effects on embryos. in wild-type embryos, apoptosis was enhanced in the brain, eyes, pharynx and tail tip. however, maternal expression of xr <dig> was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis. interestingly, zygotic expression of xr <dig> at this time was not effective in preventing apoptosis even though xr <dig> protein was abundant at the time of irradiation. the failure of zygotically-derived xr <dig> to provide protection from apoptosis implies that synthesis of xr <dig> protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis.

embryos irradiated during the mid- <dig> stages of development revealed that the maternal effect conferring protection from radiation-induced apoptosis had diminished significantly in the head and pharynx but persisted in the tails. it will be interesting to learn whether the difference between the heads and tails is due to preferential distribution or stability of maternal xr <dig> protein itself or is due to auxiliary factors that influence xr <dig> protein function. bcl-xl and other members of the bcl- <dig> family are known to be subject to post-translational regulation by such events as phosphorylation, proteolysis, cleavage, protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization  <cit> . intriguingly, at these later stages, zygotic xr <dig> protein conferred global radiation protection. thus, the initial lack of functionality of zygotic xr <dig> protein that we observed after the mbt had been overcome.

biologically, the responses to irradiation after the mbt are probably more significant than the universal, catastrophic apoptosis that occurs in embryos irradiated before the mbt. failure to eliminate cells mutagenized by irradiation would result in retention of cells that may have functional deficiencies and have the potential to become malignant due to genetic damage. thus, the mechanisms that control apoptosis in response to dna damage have important adaptive significance. radiotherapy and a number of chemicals have been shown to damage dna and induce apoptosis in mammals; this property has been exploited in the clinic to induce apoptosis of cancer cells. resistance to apoptosis has important implications for the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy because tumor cells that overexpress either bcl- <dig> or bcl-xl may be resistant to either mode of cancer therapy  <cit> . on the other hand, their over-expression in non-tumor cells could enhance the ability of these cells to survive the otherwise lethal effects of radiation and chemotherapy.

our results indicate that synthesis of bcl-xl is not sufficient to confer radiation protection; rather, it belatedly acquires functionality. possible explanations for the failure of bcl-xl synthesized after the mbt to protect against apoptosis could include the absence of posttranslational modifications to the protein or the lack of a cooperative factor that is necessary for the protein to function effectively. the presence of this mechanism that confers functionality on bcl-xl protein before the mbt and its absence soon after the mbt may provide an assay system that would facilitate its identification. the discovery of a mechanism that could control whether cells undergo apoptosis after exposure to an apoptogenic stimulus could have important implications for improving the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS
our results are consistent with a model in which the execution of developmental apoptosis in embryos is dependent upon a balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic factors with bcl-xl being one of the anti-apoptotic factors. the drastic reduction of apoptosis in xr <dig> transgenic embryos had no apparent functional consequences. metamorphosis of transgenic tadpoles was apparently normal, as was the response to exogenous thyroid hormone. the ability to produce second-generation transgenic xr <dig> embryos enabled us to examine both the maternal and zygotic contributions of bcl-xl to the apoptotic response to γ-radiation. post-mbt apoptosis that was triggered by irradiation before the mbt was restrained by maternal expression of bcl-xl. however, zygotic expression of bcl-xl was ineffective in overcoming the effects of prior irradiation. maternal expression of xr <dig> was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-mbt γ-radiation. however, zygotic expression of xr <dig> at this time was not effective in preventing apoptosis even though xr <dig> protein was abundant.
