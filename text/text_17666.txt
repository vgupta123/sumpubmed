BACKGROUND
sigma factors specify bacterial transcription by binding to a characteristic promoter and thereby recruiting the associated rna polymerase to that promoter. ordinarily, the expression of genes/operons is controlled by the so-called 'housekeeping' sigma factor  <dig>  however, most bacteria possess a larger repertoire of sigma factors of the sigma- <dig> family, where each additional factor is associated with a specific programmed response  <cit> . for instance, in escherichia coli and related gamma-proteobacteria the entry into stationary phase and the adaptation to starvation is associated with sigma-s  <cit> , whereas the response to heat shock and similar stresses is mediated by sigma- <dig> . in bacillus subtilis, sporulation is orchestrated by  <dig> sigma factors   <cit> , whereas the general stress response is controlled by sigma-b  <cit> . in many species, particular extracellular signals are translated into an appropriate response by ecf sigma factors  <cit> .

there is one sigma factor that seemingly does not fit in this picture as it has been associated with a range of physiological phenomena instead of with a singular response. sigma- <dig>  constitutes an evolutionary separate protein family and is found widely distributed among the bacterial kingdom, although there are phyla that lack the protein  <cit> . it binds to a characteristic -24/- <dig> promoter  <cit>  and absolutely requires the input of free energy  from an associated activator to initiate transcription  <cit>  . in most cases the activator binds to an enhancer element located upstream of the promoter and hence is referred to as enhancer binding protein . the ebp54s bind the dna as inactive dimers, but upon reception of the appropriate signal they assemble into oligomeric rings  <cit> , with hexamers constituting the oligomeric active state  <cit> . a large variety of ebp54s exists and although some species possess one, for instance chlamydia trachomatis  <cit>  and lactobacillus plantarum  <cit> , most species have more variants. b. subtilis and e. coli were reported to have five  and twelve  <cit> , respectively, and myxococcus xanthus to have fifty-three  <cit> . however, many of the reported numbers need correction  because the previous analyses have included ebp <dig> paralogs that have lost the interaction with sigma- <dig>  like tyrr  <cit>  and dhar  <cit>  in e. coli and hupr in rhodobacter capsulatus  <cit> .

historically, sigma- <dig> has been linked to the regulation of nitrogen metabolism. the protein was discovered as a positive regulatory factor needed for the expression of enterobacterial glutamine synthetase  <cit> , before it was recognized that the protein is actually a sigma factor  <cit> . however, it was soon after established that sigma- <dig> mediated control of transcription is not only connected to nitrogen assimilation but to a wider range of cellular processes and physiology in the enterobacteria  <cit> . since then, it was shown that its role also encompasses the regulation of for example: flagellar biosynthesis in e. coli  <cit> ; carboxylate uptake, central metabolism and flagellar biosynthesis in geobacter sulfurreducens  <cit> ; phosphotransferase system -mediated carbohydrate uptake in the gram-positive species lactobacillus plantarum  <cit>  and listeria monocytogenes  <cit> ; and pts-mediated regulation in gram-positive as well as gram-negative organisms  <cit> ; osmotolerance in listeria  <cit> ; the utilization of compounds like gamma-aminobutyrate in bacillus  <cit> , and the less familiar biphenyl in ralstonia metallidurans  <cit>  and toluene, xylene  and choline  <cit>  in pseudomonas; type iii secretion system mediated pathogenicity in pseudomonas syringae  <cit>  and type vi secretion system mediated toxin secretion in e.g. aeromonas and marinomonas  <cit> ; the adaptation to cold shock in b. subtilis  <cit> ; the control of sigma-s  <cit> , lipoprotein biosynthesis and virulence  <cit>  in borrelia burgdorferi; acid resistance of pathogenic e. coli o <dig>  <cit> ; biofilm formation by burkholderia  <cit> ; and motility, biofilm formation, luminescence, and colonization in vibrio fischeri  <cit> . the above plethora of associations has up to now obscured the definition of a general underlying functional theme that adds to the accepted associations with nitrogen metabolism and flagellar biosynthesis.

several comparative studies have been performed for sigma- <dig> and ebp54-mediated regulation  <cit> , but no unifying biological theme was identified. an in-depth comparative analysis was made for e. coli by  <cit> . these authors concluded that nitrogen assimilation was one of the main processes connecting the sigma- <dig> regulon. besides, they found that a substantial fraction of the associated functions was seemingly unrelated. some additional associations were proposed on basis of a comparative analysis on pseudomonas putida, including links to carbon metabolism and flagellar biosynthesis  <cit> . since the last comprehensive comparative study in  <dig> a considerable number of genomes has been sequenced, allowing us to make a new overview of the presence of sigma- <dig> and the ebp-activators. surprisingly, we found a clear-cut connection between the presence of the system and characteristic morphological features. to enhance the identification of true ebp <dig> activators and sigma- <dig> promoters, we have tested and employed a straightforward motif search algorithm that directly relates to sequence similarity. redefinition of the -24/- <dig> promoter and the similar motif search  approach allowed for the reliable identification of promoter sites in all species. finally, we have analyzed the function annotations that were highly represented  and conserved  within the genomic context of all genes encoding sigma- <dig>  its activators and its promoters, to identify common functional traits.

conserved genome context, i.e. synteny, is a strong indicator of a functional relationship between genes  <cit>  and it is therefore being used broadly to guide function prediction. in principle, the fact that encoded functions that show a conserved genomic proximity are mostly related does not only hold for genes, but by necessity extends in the direction of genetic  elements  <cit> , and thereby also in the direction of associated regulators  and their activating signals  <cit> . as a consequence, a comparative analysis of the conserved genome context of regulators and regulatory elements should yield clues regarding the particular associated stimuli and responses. although regulatory routes can vary between species much more than metabolic pathways, the functional associations at a higher hierarchical level  are far less variable. for instance, the bacterial pts mediates the transport and phosphorylation of carbohydrates by means of phosphoenolpyruvate via the same phosphotransfer mechanism in all species and, at a higher hierarchical level, the system controls the same processes like catabolite repression and chemotaxis  <cit> . nevertheless, the precise regulatory interactions of the pts and the intracellular signals that connect the organism's physiological state to the metabolic level differ significantly between groups of species . the above implies that underlying functional themes that can not be discovered directly, for instance by studying conserved gene-associations of a particular regulator, may be discovered by mapping the associated functions at a higher hierarchical level .

absolute conservation will be relatively rare because of the earlier noted variability in the specific regulatory associations. to take such variability into account, we included in our analysis those functional associations that are highly represented within a phylum/class but are at the same time evolutionary conserved, that is present within several phyla/classes. associations that fulfill this criterion can be viewed as cross-phylum  conserved function tendencies. by mapping of the conserved annotations present in the genetic context of the genes encoding sigma- <dig>  its ebp54-activators and its promoters, we discovered that there is indeed a common functional theme related to sigma-54-mediated regulation, namely, the control of the transport and biosynthesis of the molecules that constitute the bacterial exterior, which encompass the extracellular polysaccharides , flagella, lipopolysaccharides , lipoproteins and the building blocks of the peptidoglycan cell wall.

RESULTS
taxonomic diversity of sigma- <dig> and its enhancers
completely sequenced and published prokaryotic genomes listed in the gold database  <cit>  were searched at the protein level for homologs of sigma- <dig> and the related enhancer-binding proteins . experimentally characterized proteins were used to seed the search . in the case of sigma- <dig>  the sequences of the e. coli and b. subtilis proteins sufficed to recover all orthologs using a low cutoff value  . in the case of the far more diverse ebp54s, a list of  <dig> experimentally verified proteins from diverse species was compiled and it required extensive filtering to reduce the initial list of putative homologs . the final list is given in additional file  <dig> and corresponds well with earlier analyses performed at a smaller scale  <cit> .

the collection of sequences exhibited a near perfect match between the presence in a genome of sigma- <dig> and its ebp54-activators. a well-known exception was formed by the neisseria strains that have a gene encoding sigma- <dig> but lack an obvious candidate ebp <dig>  however, the neisserial sigma- <dig> protein is inactive because the two helices that interact with the - <dig> promoter region  <cit>  are missing in this protein  <cit> . the other exceptions were borrelia hermsii dah, borrelia turicatae 91e <dig>  fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum atcc  <dig> and jannaschia sp. ccs <dig>  which possess a putative ebp <dig> but lack a sigma- <dig> ortholog. as the initial search was performed using the translated protein sequences we also searched the nucleotide sequence directly and found that the chromosome of b. hermsii carries an intact rpon gene that was obviously missed in the original annotation procedure. however, we could not identify rpon in b. turicatae. a rationale for the absence of sigma- <dig> in fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum atcc  <dig> and jannaschia sp. ccs <dig> will be given in the next section.

sigma- <dig> and ebp54s were found in the majority of sequenced species  and in the majority of the evaluated phyla, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  remarkably, their presence is almost absolutely conserved in species that are diderm  and have an outer membrane that mainly consists of lipopolysaccharides   <cit> . the diderm species in which sigma- <dig> and its activators are absent represent mostly endosymbionts , e.g. species from the genus bartonella, buchnera, ehrlichia, francisella, neisseria and rickettsia, and elusimicrobium minutum  <cit> . furthermore, the proteins are also absent from all  <dig> sequenced species/strains of the phylum cyanobacteria. for the monoderm phyla and for the diderm phyla that have different lps or lack lps altogether the picture is inverse, i.e. in most of the related species sigma- <dig> and ebp54s are absent. they were identified only in some chloroflexi and thermotogae. in contrast, they are present in many firmicutes, that is in most species of the class clostridia and in the sporulating species of the class bacilli. in addition, they were found in listeria, enterococcus faecalis and in the closely related lactobacilli lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus casei .

there was an overall correlation between the size of the genome and the presence of sigma- <dig> as illustrated in figure 2a. most endosymbionts or facultative intracellular species have a small genome  and lack sigma- <dig>  although some  do have sigma- <dig> and contain one activator. in addition, species of the phyla actinobacteria and cyanobacteria have much larger genomes  but lack the sigma- <dig> system. a small number of proteobacteria, mostly species/strains from the orders burkholderiales, rhizobiales and xanthomonadales , possess two variants of the sigma factor and the sequenced rhodobacter sphaeroides strains even contain three or four variants  <cit> . in the case that sigma- <dig> is present, there is a strong positive correlation between the number of encoded ebp54s and the size of the genome as might be expected . on top of that, there appeared to be a clear phylum/class dependency ranging from the delta-proteobacteria with around  <dig> ebp54s on average to the epsilon-proteobacteria, chlamydia and spirochetes with on average  <dig> or  <dig> activators . importantly, a strong positive correlation between reported motility and the presence of sigma- <dig> was observed and this correlation appeared predominantly independent of genome size . the strong correlation fortifies the general view that one of the common functional themes of sigma- <dig> mediated control is the association with the synthesis of flagella and or pili, an association that has been observed for many species . other clear correlations with particular bacterial lifestyles  were not observed.

sequence-based identification and characterization of the ebp54s
the list of ebp54s that was obtained in a blast search using the sigma- <dig> interaction/activator domain , was initially filtered using two criteria based on cut off value . in this way,  <dig> potential ebp54s were identified. the list contained many false positives , which were mostly proteases and mg2+ chelatases  <cit>  as these are the closest relatives of the sigma- <dig> interaction/activator domain  <cit> . to remove false positives, we analyzed the presence of the characteristic 'gaftga' amino acid sequence that is essential for the interaction between the activator and the sigma factor  <cit> . it has been established that single residue changes within the sequence element and especially within the central phenylalanine and threonine, reduce the transcriptional activity considerably and mostly abolish it  <cit> . given the reported constraints, which are summarized in the legend of figure  <dig>   <dig> true and  <dig> putative ebp54s were obtained . the 'gaftga' sequence within this set is highly conserved , and the importance of this conservation is corroborated by the substitutions/deletions that lead to 'non-functional' ebp <dig> homologs, like in tyrr, dhar of e. coli and hupr of r. capsulatus, which have been shown to be sigma- <dig> dependent . similar changes were observed within the protein sequence of the vpsr regulator of polysaccharide production in vibrio cholerae and the yplp regulator of the cold shock response in b. subtilis. these proteins were proposed to be sigma- <dig> dependent , but considering the lack of compelling experimental evidence and the clear deletion within the 'gaftga' sequence  they are probably not. we found that around  <dig> of the recovered homologs showed such minor deviations and within this group there appeared to be a preference for the substitution of the thr/ser at position  <dig> by a pro . in the putative ebps of fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum atcc  <dig> and jannaschia sp. ccs <dig>  thr/ser at position  <dig> is replaced by glu. considering the fact that both organisms lack sigma- <dig>  the observed replacement may have resulted in a sigma- <dig> dependency, like observed for dhar and tyrr. the fact that fusobacterial ebp is orthologous to phhr of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a paralog of tyrr which was shown to be able to replace tyrr as a repressor of the arof-tyra operon in e. coli  <cit> , supports this assumption.

previous comparative analyses of the sigma- <dig> associated ebp54s made clear that the sigma- <dig> activators connect to a wide spectrum of input signals  <cit> . in fact, this could be one of the main reasons that a common functional theme thus far has remained obscured. currently, the pfam database describes around  <dig> different domain compositions  for ebp54s. nevertheless, some generalizations can be made. all ebp54s possess a central activator domain, which is responsible for the interaction with sigma- <dig> and provides the atpase activity that is required to initiate transcription. in addition, most enhancer-binding proteins have one to several signal binding/recognition domains and a dna-binding domain, although some ebp54s lack either the former or the latter  <cit> . basically two main domain organizations can be discerned, which can be further subdivided according to specific domain composition as indicated schematically in figure 3b.

to specify the functional associations of the sigma- <dig> activators, pfam domain annotations were collected from the uniprot database and used to make an inventory of the specific ebp <dig> categories. we found that around 43% of the activators were of type ia, thus related to the transduction of extracellular signals/cues via a two-component system histidine kinase . furthermore, around 12% of the activators contained a pas domain and around 10% a gaf domain . earlier comparative analyses have shown that these two are the most wide-spread domains among bacterial signaling systems  <cit> . the pas domain has been linked to a variety of  signaling molecules  <cit>  and the same holds for the gaf domain , although it was originally linked to the recognition of cyclic nucleotides . in several cases the pas and gaf domain occurred in conjunction with another signal-recognition domain, which is suggestive of dual activation and or signal integration. around 4% of the activators was of type ic, lacking a dna-binding domain and/or signal recognition domain. finally, around 3% of the activators was directly linked to signaling via the pts. these activators included proteins of type ib with an hpr signal-domain found in clostridia   <cit>  and the proteins constituting type ii , with four different phosphorylatable domains . notably, a substantial number of ebp54s lacked a clear pfam annotation of the putative signal recognition domain. given the specificity of the hidden markov models used to identify the response regulator domain one may assume that these activators mainly represented types 1b and 1c. around 8% of all ebp <dig> sequences was shorter than  <dig> amino acids, making them likely of type 1c. based on the above, type 1b activators represented around 46% of the ebp54s identified.

more than half of the activators  could be annotated in a coarse way, on basis of the similarity to experimentally verified ebp54s. as expected, the coverage within the gamma-proteobacteria and the firmicutes was higher than for other classes. nevertheless, the data clearly indicate that the 'membership' and cross-phylum conservation is much higher for certain annotations than for others, as illustrated in table  <dig>  more explicitly, the annotations within the largest group include connections to the catabolism of short-chain fatty-acids and chemotaxis , the synthesis of lipoprotein  and the response to cyclic-di-gmp , a second messenger that regulates cell-surface-associated traits  <cit> . other highly represented and cross-phylum conserved associations include the control of nitrogenase , nitric oxide reduction , nitrogen assimilation and the production of eps and lps , the transport and metabolism of carboxylates , flagellar synthesis  and the degradation and uptake of various kinds of cell wall saccharides . minor activities not listed include the sensing, transport and metabolism of hydrocarbons , aromatic amino acids  and the production of the eps alginate .

column one lists the type of ebp <dig> and column two a general group annotation. the annotation was based on blast scores against a list of  <dig> experimentally characterized activators  and represents around 60% of the identified activators. columns  <dig> and  <dig> provide the  number of activators that are in the group and column  <dig> gives the number of phyla/classes that are represented . column  <dig> lists the characterized activators that are member the group. the final column provides a function description for the specified group member as retrieved from literature, where the main metabolite or process is in bold type.*the ebps of type ic, include pspf  <cit> , hrpr   <cit>  and lafk   <cit>  which lack a separate signal recognition domain, chlamydia ctcc  <cit>  and helicobacter flgr  <cit>  which lack a dna-binding domain. and r. sphaeroides flet  <cit>  which lacks both domains.

identification of sigma- <dig> promoters
the sigma- <dig> amino acid sequence can be divided into three distinct parts that show a high degree of conservation  <cit>  as depicted in figure 4a. however, the sequences that link the parts can vary considerably depending on the species. the c-terminus contains two separate helix-turn-helix motifs  that are responsible for recognition of the - <dig> and - <dig> promoter elements, respectively. the multiple sequence alignment of all recovered sigma- <dig> sequences shows that the amino acid residues of the two hth motifs are especially well-conserved . the degree of conservation of the hth residues corresponds remarkably well to the negative effect on activity that was measured after the substitution of residue pairs  <cit> . considering the high degree of conservation within the dna-binding sequence of sigma- <dig>  one would expect a similar degree of conservation for the promoter sequence. indeed, a consensus promoter sequence has been defined earlier by combining experimentally verified promoters from a variety of species  <cit> . the consensus has been used by many researchers to search for new putative sigma- <dig> binding sites . nevertheless, it is very clear from the conservation pattern within the consensus promoter that some positions are not very informative. therefore, we reduced the size of the promoter motif and smoothed those frequencies that appeared to be rather random, to arrive at a frequency representation of the sigma- <dig> promoter as given in figure 4c.

the reduced sigma- <dig> promoter motif was used to identify similar sites in all the studied genomes. to that end, we formulated a straightforward frequency-based scheme to score similarity and implemented the scheme in a similar motif search  tool . sms was tested to predict the well-studied ccpa and spo0a regulon in b. subtilis and the simple scoring appeared as effective as mast and more effective than hmms in finding members of the respective regulons . the results of the similar motif search for the sigma- <dig> promoter were evaluated by setting an arbitrary initial score threshold , and then counting the number of occurrences in every genome. as expected, there was a clear correlation between the number of identified similar sites and genome size. in contrast, there was no clear difference between the number of potential binding-sites in organisms that have sigma- <dig> versus organisms that do not. however, in case the orientation and the distance of the potential promoters with respect to the predicted translation start sites of the genes located downstream was taken in to account, the difference was obvious . for organisms that possess sigma- <dig>  a large fraction of the most similar binding-sites is located in the region between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides upstream of a translation start , whereas in organisms that lack sigma- <dig> the distribution of sites shows a slight decrease in this region . in fact, this finding implies that those potential sites that are appropriately located to function as a promoter are highly likely to function as a genuine sigma- <dig> promoter. therefore, the list of potential sites could be reduced using a simple distance criterion  to yield a list of putative sigma- <dig> controlled genes/operons .

the validity of the above identifications was substantiated by a comparison of several predicted species-specific sigma- <dig> regulons with those reported in literature. the comparison included b. subtilis  <cit> , e. coli  <cit> , lactobacillus plantarum  <cit>  and pseudomonas putida  <cit>  . all regulons that were compared showed a very good agreement for the high ranking predicted promoters . the high-ranked predicted promoters captured more than 95% of the established sites in pseudomonas putida, b. subtilis and lactobacillus plantarum. in e. coli, 90% of the established sigma- <dig> promoters was captured in case a slightly lower threshold was used . the relatively higher number of less similar 'true' sites in e. coli is in line with earlier findings  <cit> . not only did we observe excellent agreement between the predictions and established sigma- <dig> promoters, we also identified new likely 'regulon' members. these include for instance: the genes lp_ <dig>  and lp_ <dig>  in lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1; the genes pp_ <dig> , pp_ <dig>  and pp_ <dig>  in pseudomonas putida; and the genes b <dig> , b <dig>  in e.coli. expression of the small rna encoding gene glmy was indeed proven to be sigma- <dig> dependent in e. coli and other enterobacteria such as yersinia pseudotuberculosis and salmonella typhimurium  <cit> .

conserved function tendencies in genomic context
we collected various kinds of annotations to identify a potential underlying functional theme, for genes: i) that share genome context with the gene encoding sigma- <dig> ; ii) that occur in transcriptional units containing an ebp54-activator encoding gene ; and iii) that are in transcriptional units preceded by a putative sigma- <dig> promoter . the annotations that were extracted from the reference databases included: cog  and go categories , pfam  and interpro  domains, kegg orthologs , ec numbers , trivial gene names  and detailed function descriptions . the average coverage of the various annotations that is given between brackets for the three context collections shows that only part of the recovered genes was connected to annotation information. the cog categories, pfam domains and kegg orthologs together connect more than 80% of the complete set of genes to a function annotation and therefore these annotations should represent the overall genetically associated functions to a reasonable extent. the annotations were lumped in a phylum-specific manner and those annotations that were highly represented within a phylum or class  and represented within several phyla/classes , were extracted. the results of the procedure can be found in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and are summarized in the following.

over-representation of a particular cog category  within at least half of the analyzed phyla/classes is indicated by +. the categories that were over-represented in more than two genetic contexts are indicated in bold. the functional categories that are not relevant because they are either non-specific  or mostly specific for eukaryotes  are not shown.

we then inspected the recovered annotations more specifically and found that various genes/function descriptions are often genomically associated to sigma- <dig> mediated control. not surprisingly, the main function associations found within the genetic context of the ebp54s and the best ranked promoters were very similar to those that have been reported in literature for the various sigma- <dig> ebp-activators. the retrieved genes encoded: various histidine kinases, transport systems of metal ions, nitrate or ammonium, carboxylates, amino acids and cell wall sugars and many flagellar proteins . the genetic context of the sigma- <dig> encoding gene was remarkably conserved throughout. in the didermal species it contained: yhbj, encoding a regulator of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase  <cit> , lptabc, encoding the system responsible for the transport of lps from inner- to outer-membrane  <cit> , kdscd, encoding genes related to the synthesis of the lps building block 2-keto-3-deoxyoctanate   <cit> , ptsntr, a system implicated in the integrative regulation of nitrogen and carbon metabolism  <cit> , and yhbh , a gene implicated in the phenomenon of ribosome hibernation that occurs in stationary phase  <cit> . in the sigma- <dig> containing monoderm species , a conserved association was found with yhbj, like in the diderm species, and with the genes encoding the central glycolytic enzymes and their regulator cggr  <cit> .

the highly represented annotations related to metabolic reactions were mapped on a metabolic map, representing most generic biochemical pathways, using the webtool ipath  <cit>  . it was immediately clear from the patchy appearance that the retrieved genetically associated functions did not seem to converge on certain predefined metabolic pathways like for instance glycolysis or amino acid biosynthesis. however, when the metabolites that were involved in the mapped reactions were inspected, a surprisingly clear picture emerged. these metabolites included various carboxylates , charged coenzyme a , nucleotides, several nitrogen-containing metabolites including various amino-sugars, and the central glycolytic molecules . together, the metabolites constitute the essential precursors for the biosynthesis of eps sugars  <cit> ), lipoprotein and phospholipids , teichoic acids , lps  and fatty acids  <cit> ), and peptidoglycan   <cit> . indeed, the essential reactions of the related synthesis routes appeared to be highly represented and conserved. the above findings strongly support a common regulatory role for sigma- <dig> in the control of the biosynthesis of the bacterial exterior.

discussion
we have applied a coherent comparative sequence-based strategy to search for functional themes that are common to sigma- <dig> mediated control. the strategy basically consisted of three semi-independent comparative analyses concerning: i) the taxonomic distribution; ii) the sigma- <dig> activator content; and iii) the genomic context of sigma- <dig>  its activator and the characteristic promoter. in principle, the former and the latter analysis can be used to identify the functional theme that is associated to any bacterial regulator.

one of the main challenges we encountered in the analysis of the genetic context of sigma- <dig>  its ebp54-activators and the sigma- <dig> promoters, was the fact that most of the function information that is gathered in larger resources in the public domain is given and viewed in terms of a limited set of established biochemical pathways and/or functional classes. as a result, the recovered genetic associations per se did not reveal a single over-represented functional category  or a complete pathway , in line with earlier observations. however, changing the perspective from isolated categories and pathways to a more integrated  view, and from pathways to compounds, all of a sudden a coherent pattern emerged . most of the conserved reactions and transport systems relate directly or indirectly to the biosynthesis of eps, lipoprotein, teichoic acids, lps, peptidoglycan and phospholipids, by producing and/or transporting the particular precursors/building blocks. in fact, this common functional theme of being a controller of the synthesis of the bacterial exterior covers very well the diversity within the reported physiological effects of sigma- <dig>  in the following we will discuss the foundation of this assessment in more detail.

considerations based on conservation
a clear relation between the activity of sigma- <dig> and the synthesis of flagella and or pili has been established in a wide variety of bacterial species . indeed, this association appears very general considering the strong correlation between the presence of sigma- <dig> and cellular motility . moreover, a comparison of the presence/absence distribution with the transition-based tree of life advocated by  <cit>  was in line with this generalization. those species that were proposed to have developed before the advent of flagella lack sigma- <dig>  whereas the majority of species that were proposed to have arisen later have the sigma factor.

the classification of the various phyla based on morphological features  as presented in figure  <dig>  revealed another clear functional association. sigma- <dig> is mainly present in diderm organisms that synthesize lps. although the association is not absolute, a closer inspection of the diderm species that lack sigma- <dig> showed that more than 90% of them are  endosymbionts. the organisms of the phylum cyanobacteria constitute a notable exception. however, it has been reported that their lps is distinct from that of the other lps-containing diderm species  <cit> . thus, a straightforward comparison of the morphology and mobility of species that have sigma- <dig> versus species that do not, provides a clear link between the sigma factor and the presence of flagella and the biosynthesis of lps. in fact it was shown recently, that the assembly of the flagella and the lps in campylobacter jejuni is an associated process and linked through a single enzyme  <cit> .

we have collected a complete set of ebp54s for the analyzed genomes and classified them on basis of domain structure and similarity to experimentally verified activators. the annotation of the main groups of ebp54s suggested a clear relation to the biosynthesis of the bacterial exterior and the transport and synthesis of the required precursors. the most dominant activator subgroup was formed by the atoc-like activators  and was represented in all but one of the analyzed phyla. the main family member atoc has been associated in the literature with the catabolism of short-chain fatty-acids, the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate and with the expression of flagellar genes  <cit> .

the common functional theme was also perfectly reflected in the genomic context of the sigma- <dig> encoding genes. more specifically, in many firmicutes the enzymes of the lower branch of glycolysis are genetically associated, thus linking sigma- <dig> to the synthesis of 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate . the former compound can easily be converted to 3-phosphoglycerol, whereas pep is essential to convert udp-n-acetylglucosamine to udp-n-acetylmuramic acid during the formation of peptidoglycan  <cit> . in addition, pep serves as free energy donor in the transport of sugars mediated by the pts. in most diderms the lps transport system  <cit>  and enzymes involved in synthesis of the building block of the lps core   <cit>  are genetically associated to the sigma- <dig> encoding gene. in fact, it has been proposed that this association represents the ancestral state of all proteobacteria  <cit> . the same holds for yhbj, a gene that encodes an important regulator of the glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase and is controlled by sigma- <dig> in e. coli  <cit> , where glucosamine-6-phosphate is the main amino-sugar precursor in the synthesis of lps and the bacterial cell wall  <cit> . interestingly, in the enterobacteria, sigma- <dig> also controls the activity of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase via the expression of the small rna regulators glmy and glmz  <cit> .

the direct links to central nitrogen and central carbon metabolism
a specific 'nitrogen-pts'  and mannose-pts were also proposed to be part of the ancestral proteobacterial association  <cit> . the ptsntr is found in proteobacteria   <cit>  and is involved in the integrative regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . in addition, the ptsntr has been connected to the control of biofilm formation in vibrio cholerae  <cit> . remarkably, the mannose-pts connection is found in all firmicutes, either directly like in the lactobacilli lactobacillus plantarum  <cit>  and pediococcus pentosaceus, or indirectly via the ebp54-activators. the latter levr/celr-like activators are found in all sigma- <dig> containing firmicutes and in some enterobacteria. their activity is controlled by extracellular carbohydrate and intracellular pep levels via the pts  <cit> . the connected pts systems have been shown to transport cell-wall related carbohydrates  <cit>  and belong to the cellobiose and mannose sub-families. it was recently shown by  <cit>  that the mannose-family pts manxyz of e. coli plays an important role in the secretion of the glucosamine intermediates from the cytoplasm to the periplasm where the e. coli cell wall is assembled.

regulation by sigma- <dig> is clearly linked to central nitrogen metabolism. in a noteworthy attempt to uncover an underlying functional theme for sigma- <dig> mediated transcriptional control within e. coli  <cit>  concluded that nitrogen assimilation was a major theme and that, considering the widespread distribution of the sigma- <dig> system together with the constraints determined by maintenance of promoter integrity, the role of sigma- <dig> should be limited to a few physiologically related themes in the various organisms. in fact, considering the composition of the bacterial exterior  and the way the different components are covalently linked, the association with nitrogen assimilation is rather logical. the important precursors of the biosynthesis of the molecules of the exterior are glucosamine, glu, lys, pep and various fatty acids . most other precursors can be synthesized out of these. for instance, glu and pep can be converted to oxaloacetate and ala  <cit> , and lys can be interconverted to diaminopimelate   <cit> . in the last case, the biosynthesis route starts at aspartate, the transport of which is controlled by the sigma- <dig> dependent two-component system dctbd in many species  <cit> . in addition, many of the moieties are finally covalently linked through peptide bonds, which involve an amino- and a carboxyl-group. therefore, in order to control the direction and scale of the metabolic fluxes related to the biosynthesis of the different exterior structures the bacterium should control the extent of nitrogen assimilation and the production of the central metabolites glu and pep. nevertheless, the way in which the control is exerted may vary between species. for instance, sigma- <dig> is controlling the intracellular glu levels via glutamate dehydrogenase in the monoderm b. subtilis  <cit> , whereas it acts on glutamine synthetase in the diderm e. coli .

CONCLUSIONS
we have established a clear connection between sigma- <dig> and the make-up of the bacterial exterior. the sigma factor exerts its control directly by regulating the expression of the genes involved in the transport and biosynthesis of the main precursors. in some cases, the control is indirect and mediated via an additional regulator like in the case of ptsntr  <cit>  or via another sigma factor like sigma-s in borrelia  <cit>  or sigma- <dig> in enterobacteria  <cit> . however, experimental evidence for the latter connection has not yet been reported. in contrast to the situation in borrelia, in e. coli, sigma- <dig> and sigma-s have been predicted to act in an antagonistic way  <cit> . of course, the control exerted by sigma- <dig> should not be viewed as an isolated process or acting at the level of transcription alone. regarding the latter, there seems to be a connection to control at the level of translation activity . regarding the former, because sigma- <dig> mediated control will affect various fluxes involving central metabolites, other global regulatory factors bear upon its activity, such as the dna-bending proteins ihf and crp, the alarmone ppgpp and the rna-polymerase targeting protein dska .

although the association with the exterior constitutes the evolutionary conserved  functional basis of sigma- <dig> mediated control, the extent to which the related processes are controlled will very much depend on the species, as is obvious from the variation in the number of sigma- <dig> activators. in addition, other processes might have become linked too because they feed on the same metabolic intermediates. vice versa, such connections might also have been lost and there are several examples of that. these include the activators dhar, tyrr and vpsr, which are related to the regulation of the uptake and phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone  <cit> , of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids biosynthesis  <cit> , and of the biosynthesis of a particular eps in vibrio cholerae  <cit> , respectively. these activators clearly descended from active sigma- <dig> dependent ebp54s but now carry a small deletion that has made them sigma- <dig> independent.

the regulatory connection to the bacterial exterior explains all of the reported physiological variability related to sigma- <dig> very well. for instance, the impact on osmotolerance that was observed for listeria monocytogenes upon deletion of sigma- <dig>  <cit>  could very well be related to its role in petidoglycan synthesis. in fact, in e. coli turgor pressure is controlled through potassium ion transport via the kdp system, a system which in turn is controlled via the ptsntr and thus by sigma- <dig>  <cit> . the reported changes in virulence can also be explained perfectly through changes in the lps composition. in addition, alterations in the motility and the presence of flagella will directly affect the invasive power, as observed for borrelia burgdorferi  <cit> , and also the swarming behavior on surfaces  <cit> . related to that, adaptations of the bacterial exterior mediated by sigma- <dig> will clearly have to affect the formation and the properties of bacterial biofilms. and this is precisely what has been observed for many species  <cit> . sigma- <dig> and the associated activators thus represent potentially highly effective targets in the areas of food safety and health as changes in the bacterial exterior induce the establishment and affect the stability of deleterious bacterial populations.
