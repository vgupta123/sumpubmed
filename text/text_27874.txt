BACKGROUND
one of the major challenges in current biology is to elucidate the mechanism governing the gene expression. gene expression programs depend mainly on transcription factors which bind to upstream sequences by recognizing short dna motifs called transcription factor binding sites  to regulate their target gene expression  <cit> . although many regulatory motifs have been identified, large amount of functional elements still remain unknown  <cit> .

many genome-wide approaches have been developed in attempt to discover regulatory motifs from upstream sequences. the early computational approach for identifying regulatory motifs is based on statistical analyses using only upstream sequences of genes. statistical methods such as maximum-likelihood estimation or gibbs sampling, are effective for searching directly significant sequence motifs from multiple upstream sequences  <cit> . several computational approaches based on machine learning methods have also been implemented. a som -based clustering method can find regulatory sequence motifs by grouping relevant sequence patterns  <cit>  and a graph-theoretic approach has tried to identify regulatory motifs by searching the maximum density subgraph  <cit> .

more advanced approaches have been developed that can identify regulatory motifs by linking gene expression profiles and motif patterns. the main advantage of these approaches is that they can identify motifs correlated to specific biological processes. most early trials used a unidirectional search, such as approaches that search for shared patterns with upstream sequences in a set of co-expressed genes that were found by clustering algorithms  <cit>  or those that determine whether genes with common regulatory elements are co-expressed  <cit> . in addition, it is also possible to link motifs to gene expression patterns using linear regression models or regression trees  <cit> . recently, several techniques for a bidirectional search to detect the relationship between the regulatory motifs and the gene expression profiles have been emerged  <cit> . they search regulatory motifs more efficiently than unidirectional approaches since they search similar expression patterns and regulatory motifs correlated to them simultaneously.

in this study, we propose a novel bidirectional approach using a kernel-based method, kernel cca , to analyze the relationship between regulatory sequences and gene expression profiles  <cit> . the expression and sequence features are mapped from the original input space to a higher dimension space using a kernel trick, and the relationship between the two projected objects is interpreted to identify highly correlated motifs . our method has advantages that it can detect core motifs relevant to a specific cellular process without the additional efforts of clustering and intensive motif sampling process in upstream sequences.

we applied the kernel cca to a paired set of upstream sequence motifs of genes and their expression profiles in yeast  cell cycle, and explored significant relationships between motifs and expression profiles. we also searched for regulatory motifs correlated with specific expression patterns. our method retrieved regulatory motifs that play an important role in cell cycle regulation including several well-known cell cycle regulatory motifs: mcb, scb and sff'. furthermore, we identified motif pairs associated with the gene expression to construct a map of combinatorial regulation of regulators.

RESULTS
we applied a computational method, kernel cca, to the identification of novel transcriptional regulatory elements. the main purpose of our experiments was to find regulatory motifs that were associated with gene regulation in specific biological processes. using the kernel cca, we first found highly correlated features between expression profiles and the sequence motifs. the key motifs in gene regulation were then identified from the weight scheme by the kernel cca . furthermore we demonstrate that it is possible for our method to be applied for identification of motif pairs using raw upstream sequences.

identification of the relationship between gene expression and known motifs
we first explored the relationship between gene expression profiles and known motifs using a yeast gene expression dataset related to the cell cycle  <cit>  and a set of known motifs  extracted by alignace  <cit> . a total of  <dig> orfs  in the expression dataset contained at least one known motif. in the parameter setting, the degree of polynomial kernel was set to  <dig>  the parameter σ in gaussian rbf kernel was  <dig> , and the regularization parameter was  <dig> . these parameters were chosen based on the parameter setting that produced a high correlation from multiple runs.

the results from the kernel cca were visualized using the cc <dig>  score . in figure  <dig>  each point corresponds to a gene, and a cloud of the diagonal points illustrated the correlation between the expression and the motifs. the shape of diagonal points and the high correlation coefficient  indicated that the kernel cca was able to find the close relationship between the expression profiles and the sequence motifs. we then performed the linear canonical correlation analysis using the same datasets. the correlation coefficient  obtained from the linear cca was much lower. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the linear cca could not identify the significant correlation between expression profiles and motifs. this further supports that kernel cca improve significantly in finding the correlation between the two datasets.

the motifs were searched by the weight function of equation  <dig>  with the model obtained by the kernel cca and the top ranked motifs are shown in table  <dig>  swi <dig> motif, a binding site of swi <dig> protein, has the highest weight value. swi <dig> has been known to act in g <dig> phase and in the m/g <dig> boundary in the cell cycle  <cit> . sff' motif is a binding site of fkh <dig> transcription factor that affects the expression of genes controlling the cell cycle during the g2-s phase change  <cit> . the mcb motif is one of the well-known motifs in the yeast cell cycle as a binding site in the mbf protein complex. mbf protein is composed of mbp <dig> and swi <dig>  and mbp <dig> is a dna binding component while swi <dig> has regulatory roles. it is well known that the mbf protein complex regulates the transcription of many genes in the late g <dig> phase  <cit> . alpha <dig> protein also plays a role in the cell cycle. it operates synergistically with mcm <dig> protein to repress the expression of its target genes  <cit> . mcm <dig> protein is a key regulator involved in the transcription of several m/g <dig> genes during the cell cycle  <cit> . a high weight value of alpha <dig> is supported by the evidence that alpha <dig> protein binds to the mcm <dig> protein and influences the regulation of other cell cycle-related genes  <cit> . using the set of known motifs, our results are consistent with previous reports, validating the analysis method employed.

to further validate the result of top-ranked motifs extracted by kernel cca, we compared the weights obtained from cell cycle-related orf set with those obtained from randomly selected set. we performed the same procedure using random orfs that are not known to be related to the cell cycle. figure  <dig> shows the highly weighted motifs obtained from our method in cell cycle-related gene set and non cell cycle set, and the relative positions of those motifs are presented in the weight distribution of all motifs. the weight values obtained from random set were significantly lower than those obtained from cell cycle-related orf set. we could infer that the significantly correlated motifs were not extracted from these random datasets. in summary, our method could identify the regulatory motifs that have high weights indicating high correlation between the upstream sequences and the gene expression profiles.

identification of cell cycle-related motifs
we then applied the linear kernel to the motif sequence data containing a total of  <dig>  features  extracted from the raw upstream sequences of genes and gaussian rbf kernels with parameter σ values of  <dig>  to the expression data. the regularization parameter was set to  <dig> . these parameters are also empirically chosen based on the fact that they produced a high correlation. figure  <dig> shows the cc <dig> score which represents the correlation between the expression profiles and the sequence patterns. when the linear kernel was applied to the sequence dataset, the expression data is closely related to the motif data using the raw sequences of 5-mers.

the 5-mer motif patterns with high weights are listed in table  <dig>  the 5-mer with the highest weight is 5'-gcgtg-3', which is similar to the mcb motif . as described previously, mcb is an important motif involved in the cell cycle. the second-ranked sequence  matched to the first five bases of the alpha <dig> motif sequence. from the second component, we also found several significant sequences, including a consensus sequence  that is identical to the mcb motif . this further confirmed that the mcb motif affects gene expression in the cell cycle. another interesting motif is 5'-ccacg-3', which is a sequence block with one base shift from the known scb motif . the scb motif is a binding site of the sbf protein, which is a complex of swi <dig>  and swi <dig>   <cit> , and sbf is a major regulator in the g1/s transition. in each component, the list of  <dig> motif patterns with high weights is provided in additional file  <dig> 

combinational effects of regulatory motifs
we searched the motif pairs that have synergistic or co-regulatory combination effects in the yeast cell cycle. the regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotes are highly complex since most genes are normally synergistically regulated by different transcription factors. therefore, identifying the synergistic motif combinations can contribute to systematically understanding the regulatory circuit.

in the present study, using the kernel cca we calculated the weight value for each motif pair of  <dig> known motifs. the heat map of weight values of all motif pairs is provided in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig> presents the top ten motif pairs with the highest weight values and with occurrence of more than ten in all the investigated upstream sequences. it also shows ecrscores which represent gene expression coherence. all these scores are relatively high compared to the previously identified synergistic motif pairs   <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the pair with the highest weight value is mcb-mcm <dig>  according to a previous study, mcb and mcm <dig> were characterized as a significantly cooperative motif pair in the regulation of the cell cycle  <cit> . other highly ranked pairs, such as ecb-alpha <dig> and mcm1-alpha <dig>  are already known that they are required for transcriptional regulation of early cell cycle genes. mcm <dig> activates transcription of ecb -dependent genes during m/g <dig> phase  <cit> , and the mcm <dig> protein can interact with the alpha <dig> factor regulating the expression of mating-type-specific genes  <cit> . these evidences support that two alpha2-related motif pairs act synergistically in the expressional regulation of the yeast cell cycle process. the reb <dig> motif, a binding site of reb <dig> protein, is frequently found among the pairs of motifs with the highest weights. the reb <dig> protein is an rna polymerase i enhancer-binding protein and binds to genes transcribed by both rna polymerase i and rna polymerase ii  <cit> . it is a general regulator rather than a condition specific one. therefore, it is reasonable that this protein shows a high frequency in our results. reb1-swi <dig>  reb1-mcm1' and reb1-alpha <dig> motif pairs are already identified as acting synergistically in the yeast cell cycle regulation  <cit> . most of our results are consistent with the previous reports. in addition, it's worth noting that several previously uncharacterized motif pairs were identified by our kernel cca methods.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented a novel method that can identify the candidate conditional specific regulatory motifs by employing kernel-based methods. the application of the kernel cca enables us to detect correlations between heterogeneous datasets, consisting of upstream sequences and expression profiles. from a data-mining perspective, our work is regarded as a new approach for detecting important features from regulatory sequences and gene expression profiles. we demonstrated that major motifs in a specific biological process can be extracted by a cc score via modelling a close relationship between two datasets related to gene regulation.

as genome-wide datasets of various types become available, it's important to analyze these datasets in an integrated manner  <cit> . it is possible to come up with novel biological hypotheses by integrating diverse biological resources generated for specific research purposes. in these aspects, the kernel cca is regarded as a useful method that can extract the biological factors with significant roles by integrating different types of biological data. many studies for identifying motifs have been based on sequence conservation or sequence characteristics, regardless of the biological processes. therefore our method can be regarded as complementary approach in the analysis of gene regulation.

our method found important motifs related to the cell cycle by using raw upstream sequences as well as known motif sets. in the present study we used the raw sequences of window size, l =  <dig>  if we enlarged the window size, the dimension for sequence features increased exponentially, whereas the frequency of motifs decreased. although the window size used in our experiments was shorter than the length of several known transcription factor binding sequences, it was long enough to obtain worthwhile results.

in the future research, we will apply the proposed method to diverse gene expression datasets, especially cancer-related datasets. the cancer-related regulatory program can be elucidated by analyzing regulatory motifs from a set of enriched genes in the cancer transcriptome  <cit> . using the kernel cca, a correlation analysis between regulatory sequences and the cancer transcriptome may directly catch regulatory motifs related to the abnormal gene regulatory program.
