BACKGROUND
varicella zoster virus  is the etiological agent of two clinically distinct diseases: varicella  as primary infection and zoster  after reactivation of latent virus from the dorsal root ganglia. zoster is usually observed in elderly or immuno-compromised patients  <cit> . during latency, vzv does not express lat as other α-herpesvirus do, but viral proteins that are also present during lytic infection  <cit> . transcripts from orf <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> , and several of the corresponding proteins have been detected in latently infected cells  <cit> . a recent study indicated that the expression of latency-related vzv genes, like orf <dig> and  <dig>  is regulated by epigenetic modifications of chromatin  <cit> .

ie <dig> is of particular interest in vzv pathogenesis since it is abundantly expressed during acute infection and is the most abundant and most frequently identified of the six vzv gene products expressed during latency . its cellular localization is quite particular. indeed, during a lytic infection it localizes mostly in the nucleus and slightly in the cytoplasm while during latency, it concentrates in the cytoplasm  <cit> . this protein is encoded by orf <dig> and orf <dig> and is the putative homologue of hsv icp <dig>  it has an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda and is present in the virion tegument  <cit> . moreover, ie <dig> interacts with vzv ie <dig> protein  <cit> , is essential or not for vzv replication, depending on the cell-type studied  <cit>  and critical for the establishment of latency  <cit> . in addition to regulatory functions, evidences were also provided that orf <dig> promotes neuronal cell survival after vzv infection by modulating apopflsfto κis  <cit> . it has also been recently shown that expression of ie <dig> in the absence of other viral proteins blocked the antiviral effects of ifn-alpha by inhibiting phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor  <dig>   <cit> .

the activity of ie <dig> as a potential transcriptional regulator has been subject to controversy for years. it has been claimed that ie <dig> played only a minor role in the control of vzv gene expression  <cit> . however results from our laboratory showing that ie <dig> is able to down-regulate the expression of vzv immediate early  and early  genes as well as heterologous viral and cellular promoters  <cit>  suggest that ie <dig> has essential functions in the virus infectious cycle. moreover, these repressive properties were shown to be dependent on the phosphorylation status of the protein  <cit> . others found that ie <dig> could act as a co-stimulator of ie <dig> activity on the promoter of the vzv glycoprotein i   <cit> . it was alsoshown that ie <dig> could activate transcription driven by the cellular ef-1α promoter in the absence of other viral proteins in non-neuronal cells  <cit> . finally, desloges et al. added to the list of promoters regulated by ie <dig> one other heterologous promoter, the human gapdh promoter  <cit> . thus, based on currently published data, the effects of ie <dig> appear to be pleiotropic depending at least in part of the cell type and the promoter investigated.

the mechanisms by which ie <dig> could modulate gene transcription was poorly understood before it was shown that ie <dig> could mediate its repressive properties by disorganizing the pre-initiation complex by interacting with tfiih, tfiie, and rna pol ii  <cit> . in order to better understand the mechanism of action of ie <dig>  we examined its effects on the regulation of cellular genes expression by full genome micro-array analysis in hela and mewo cells infected with a lentivirus allowing the stable expression. we found that ie <dig> alone affected the transcription of a limited set of human genes. furthermore, we showed that in hela cells the correct phosphorylation of ie <dig> is essential for the regulatory properties on endogenous promoters. recently, a micro-array analysis of mrc <dig> cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing ie <dig> has been published  <cit> . in this work, ie <dig> was shown to down-regulate the heat shock  <dig> kda protein gene expression while several histone genes were found up-regulated.

in transient transfection assays, ie <dig> was demonstrated to down-regulate several cellular nf-κb-responding genes like il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . surprisingly, these genes were not repressed in our experiments, as demonstrated by both micro-array analysis and real-time pcr. the fact that ie <dig> had no effect on basal expression of some nf-κb responsive genes may be due to a problem of promoter accessibility linked to chromatin opening. in order to assess this issue, we measured the expression rate of some of these genes  in ie <dig> expressing hela cells after treatment with tnfα, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine known to increase chromatin accessibility of several promoters. we demonstrated that ie <dig> modulated il- <dig>  icam- <dig>  and iκbα expression in response to tnfα via chromatin remodelling and modification of the recruitment of nf-κb p <dig> subunit.

RESULTS
varicella zoster virus ie <dig> protein affects transcription of a small number of genes in hela cells
in order to study the influence of ie <dig> on human cellular transcription, three independent stable hela cell lines expressing ie <dig> protein were established. the whole genome expression profiles of hela cells infected with a recombinant lentivirus expressing vzv orf <dig>  and of hela cells infected with a recombinant lentivirus where ie <dig> gene was cloned in an inverted orientation  were compared. in the lentivirus vectors used, the vzv gene was controlled by the efiα promoter and was in frame with the egpf gene but separated by an ires region. all infections were carried out with the same multiplicity of infection. as expected, the three hela cell lines infected with the lentiie <dig>  expressed the egfp protein  and a protein of approximately  <dig> kda recognized by a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the vzv orf <dig> protein . ie <dig> was not detected in the three hela cell lines infected with the lentivirus where the orf <dig> was cloned in the anti-sense direction . virtually 100% of hela cells expressed egfp as determined by flow cytometry analysis . immunofluorescence studies were carried out to evaluate the proportion of hela cells expressing ie <dig> protein, and 100% of the cells expressing the egfp protein also expressed ie <dig> .

because the correct phosphorylation of ie <dig> was found essential for its repressive properties in transient transfection studies  <cit> , hela cells stably expressing mutated forms of ie <dig> were generated : hela-ie63-s224/t222a, where two essential cdk <dig> phosphorylation residues  were substituted by alanine  <cit> , and hela-ie63-full where all the phosphorylation target residues for ck <dig>  ck <dig>  and cdk <dig> were substituted by analaline  <cit> . the expression level and the proportion of cells expressing the mutated forms of ie <dig> protein were verified . the regulation properties of these mutated proteins on cellular genes were analyzed by real-time rt-pcr. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the abolition of phosphorylation drastically reduces the up- or down-regulating properties of ie <dig> on selected genes demonstrating that phosphorylation is essential for its activity on endogenous promoters.

to control whether ie <dig> was functional, hela cell lines expressing wild-type ie <dig> were transfected with a plasmid expressing a reporter gene  under the control of the vzv dna polymerase promoter which displayed a high basal activity and is known to be down-regulated by ie <dig>  <cit> . as shown in fig. 1c, the basal activity of this promoter is down-regulated up to 50% in cells expressing ie <dig>  demonstrating that ie <dig> is functional in these cells.

these cell lines expressing the wild-type ie <dig> protein were used for a micro-array analysis to delineate the effect of this viral transcription factor on cellular gene expression. for this, we used the u133a genechips  representing  <dig>  human genes probes set. statistical filtering was done to include only genes with a modulation ρ-value <  <dig>   and found similarly regulated in three independent experiments. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in the three hela-ie <dig> cell lines relative to control cells . gene ontogeny analysis indicated that the predominant categories were signal transduction and transcription.

real-time rt-pcr experiments were then carried out to confirm the results obtained from micro-array studies. rna levels of  <dig> down-regulated  and four up-regulated  genes measured by qrt-pcr confirmed the micro-array data.

ie <dig> alters the recruitment of the human rna polymerase ii on the wif <dig> and c <dig> promoters
ie <dig> was shown to be able to disrupt the transcriptional pre-initiation complex and to interact with several general transcription factors such as rna pol ii, tfiih, and tfiie  <cit> . in order to investigate whether ie <dig> diminished or enhanced the rna pol ii binding on endogenous human promoters, chip assays using antibody to rna pol ii were carried out on promoters either up-  or down-  regulated by ie <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  ie <dig> enhanced the rna pol ii binding on the wif <dig> promoter up to 2-fold , whereas rna pol ii binding was significantly decreased by ie <dig> on the c <dig> promoter .

in conclusion, the results presented above showed that ie <dig> could modulate either positively or negatively the transcription on a restricted number of endogenous promoters and this effect required its proper phosphorylation by several cellular kinases.

the effect of ie <dig> on human gene expression is cell-type dependent
it has been recently shown that ie <dig> could modulate a different set of genes when expressed in mrc- <dig> cells  <cit> . we then decided to generate mewo cells stably expressing ie <dig> in order to determine whether the modulation of gene expression is cell-type dependent. mewo cells were then infected with the same lentivirus as above. as observed in hela cells, the proportion of cells expressing ie <dig> protein was almost 100% . as shown in fig. 4a, the expression level of ie <dig> is similar in the three independent mewo cell lines generated. micro-array analysis showed that the number of genes affected by ie <dig> was much higher in this cell-type than in hela cells . twenty-one genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated more than 2-fold in mewo-ie <dig> cells compared to control cells . gene ontogeny analysis indicated that the predominant categories were signal transduction, genes involved in transcription, which were all down-regulated, immunity/inflammation, chromatin, and  <dig> members of the heat shock protein  <dig>  family. real time rt-pcr experiments confirmed the results obtained with  <dig> up-regulated genes  and  <dig> down-regulated genes  .

ie <dig> modulates gene transcription induced by tnfα
previous works from our laboratory have shown that transiently expressed ie <dig> is able to down-regulate several cellular nf-κb-responding genes like il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . surprisingly, the basal expression level of these genes was not repressed in our experiments, as demonstrated by both micro-array analysis  and real-time rt-pcr . we also investigated the expression pattern of two other nf-κb-responding genes, icam- <dig> and iκbα, and we showed that the basal expression of these genes was not altered by ie <dig>  the fact that ie <dig> had no effect on basal expression of some nf-κb responsive genes may be due to a problem of promoter accessibility linked to chromatin. in order to assess this issue, we measured the transcription level of these genes  in ie <dig> expressing hela cells after treatment with tnfα, a cytokine known to increase chromatin accessibility of several genes. once hela cells were stimulated by tnfα for increasing times , it turned out that the presence of ie <dig> reduced the tnfα-mediated expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and icam- <dig> . surprisingly, the transcription of iκbα gene was selectively increased by the presence of ie <dig> . this unexpected result was confirmed by western blot analysis. for this, hela cells expressing or not ie <dig> were treated for increasing times  with tnfα at a final concentration of  <dig> u/ml. as shown in fig. 6b, in control hela cells a complete iκbα degradation could be observed after  <dig> min before observing its resynthesis after  <dig> min. in ie <dig> expressing hela cells, a complete iκbα degradation could also be observed  <dig> min after tnfα addition, but its resynthesis could be observed as soon as  <dig> min demonstrating that the presence of ie <dig> accelerated the replenishment of the iκbα pool.

the phosphorylation status of ie <dig> was shown to be crucial for influencing the tnfα-mediated gene transcription. for this, we compared il- <dig>  il- <dig>  icam- <dig>  and iκbα rna levels in hela cells expressing either ie <dig>  or the two mutated forms . as it shown in fig. 6a, when phosphorylation is suppressed by alanine substitution, ie <dig> did not significantly modulate the tnfα-induced gene transcription, demonstrating the importance of correct phosphorylation of ie <dig> for this property.

ie <dig> perturbs chromatin structure and nf-κb binding on the tnfα modulated gene promoters
to go one step further in the understanding of the mechanism by which ie <dig> modified il- <dig>  icam- <dig>  and iκbα inducibility by tnfα, chromatin immuno-precipitation assays  were carried out. histone acetylation and histone deacetylase  removal were often associated with an increased chromatin accessibility at nf-κb-responsive promoters  <cit> . using an antibody directed against the acetylated lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig> in chip assay, it was obvious that ie <dig> expression led to opposite effects: it reduced il- <dig> and icam- <dig> promoters accessibility whereas it increased iκbα promoter accessibility upon tnfα . the decreased accessibility of the il- <dig> and icam- <dig> promoters mediated by ie <dig> correlated very well with a recruitment of hdac <dig> while the reverse was observed with iκbα promoter .

since results from our laboratory  showed that vzv is able to interfere with the immune response by inhibiting nf-κb binding to specific promoters, we investigated the in vivo recruitment of the nf-κb subunit p <dig> on il- <dig>  icam- <dig>  and iκbα promoters. hela-ie <dig> and control cells  were treated during increasing times  with tnfα . after chromatin immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies to p <dig>  quantitative pcr amplification of a region of  <dig> bp surrounding the nf-κb site on the il- <dig>  icam- <dig> and iκbα promoters was carried out. as shown in fig. 7c, the cells treatment during one hour with tnfα induced a 3- and 25-fold increase of p <dig> binding at the nf-κb proximal site of the il- <dig>  and icam- <dig> promoter, respectively. in hela-ie <dig> cells, this increase was significantly diminished. we then looked at iκbα promoter, and it turned out that the presence of ie <dig> increased p <dig> binding . indeed, after one hour of tnfα treatment, a 3-fold increase of p <dig> binding was observed in control cells, whereas in ie <dig> expressing hela cells, a 10-fold increase was observable, demonstrating again that ie <dig> enhanced p <dig> recruitment at the iκbα promoter.

discussion
ie <dig> is of particular interest in varicella zoster virus pathogenesis since it is abundantly expressed during acute as well as latent infection  <cit> . the activity of ie <dig> as a potential transcriptional regulator has been subject to controversy for years, being described either as an activator or a repressor of transcription  <cit> .

to clarify this issue, the first part of this work was devoted to the examination of the effects of ie <dig> on cellular gene expression using a whole genome micro-array analysis in hela and mewo cells stably expressing ie <dig>  the main results obtained in this study can be summarized as follow:  ie <dig> alone affected on a cell-type mode the transcription of a limited number of human genes, including genes implicated in signal transduction, transcription, immunity, and heat-shock signalling.  ie <dig> expression led to an inhibition or an increase of rna pol ii binding on the down- and up-regulated promoters tested here.  in hela cells, the correct phosphorylation of the protein is a crucial event for its regulatory properties on endogenous promoters.

expression of ie <dig> protein by a lentivirus influenced the transcription of relatively few cellular genes in hela  and mewo cells . previous micro-array studies performed with vzv-infected cells indicated that vzv was able to modify the expression of a variable number of genes depending on the cell type used  <cit> . comparative micro-array analysis of ie <dig> expressing cells demonstrated many differences in depending on the cell type considered. indeed, hoover et al.  <cit>  showed that, in human diploid fibroblasts ,  <dig> genes of approximately  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated by ie <dig> protein. in human neuroblastoma , no significant differences in the expression level of cellular genes was found between control and ie <dig> expressing cells  <cit> .

several explanations might be proposed to explain these differences in response to ie <dig>  first, as we and other have already shown, ie <dig> is a heavily phosphorylated protein and the phosphorylation pattern is cell-type dependent  <cit> . another reason may be found in the chromatin context and promoter accessibility that may be different in the two cell types investigated. in the various works cited above, ie <dig> was expressed in several cellular backgrounds whose gene expression is likely to be differently affected by growth in cell culture. a last explanation is the viral vector used. hoover et al. measured the effect of ie <dig> as soon as two days after cell infection with an adenovirus  <cit>  whereas lentivirus was used in our work. it could be conceivable that infection mediated by adenovirus increased by itself chromatin accessibility allowing ie <dig> to access to a greater number of promoters, and then having a higher influence on cellular genes expression.

it must also be pointed out that the comparison between ie <dig> expression in mrc <dig>  <cit>  and mewo cells exhibited several common features. histone h <dig> coding genes were up-regulated in both cell types while heat shock protein  <dig>  and tnfα-induced protein  genes were down-regulated. while several viruses  have been reported to induce hsp <dig> genes  <cit> , it is not clear yet why ie <dig> specifically and drastically down-regulated the members of this family.

among the rather limited list of genes regulated in hela cells mediated by ie <dig>  the down-regulation of the gene encoding the component protein  <dig> could be noticed. the complement system comprises several dozen proteins circulating in serum, or attached to cell surfaces, and orchestrating three distinct cascades  into antimicrobial effector activities that range from the opsonization of foreign particles, the recruitment of phagocytes, to the lysis of infected cells  <cit> . the complement cascade is under tight cellular control by host inhibitor proteins, and it is perhaps not surprising that vzv has an inhibitory effect as an anti-complement defence system. some viruses, for example hcmv, induce the expression of cellular complement inhibitors like daf at the surface of infected cells  <cit> . the epstein-barr virus  also has complement regulatory activity against c <dig>  <cit> . different studies have shown that hsv- <dig> and - <dig> gc proteins offer protection against viral neutralization mediated by complement  <cit> .

when gene expression profiles obtained in this paper are compared to micro-array data obtained by the analysis of vzv infected cells  <cit> , there are several global similarities that showed up, and among them, genes implicated in immunity/inflammation, signal transduction, and transcription in t cells, or in fibroblasts, as well as in vzv-infected skin xenografts. these classes of genes are also influenced when ie <dig> is expressed alone. for instance, among genes implicated in immunity/inflammation, traf  genes are down-regulated in vzv-infected t cells as well as in ie <dig> expressing mewo cells. concerning signal transduction, two ras oncogene family members and genes coding for g protein receptors were also down-regulated in both cases. our work demonstrated that mcp- <dig> gene expression was stimulated by ie <dig>  and this result is in accordance with what was shown by jones et al. in vzv-infected cells  <cit> .

another important finding of this work was the demonstration that ie <dig> can differentially affect the tnf-inducibility of nf-κb regulated genes. the relevant results obtained here are:  in tnfα-stimulated cells, the expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  icam- <dig>  and iκbα genes was affected by ie <dig> in a promoter-dependent manner,  the phosphorylation status of the protein influenced these regulatory properties,  the effects of ie <dig> were correlated with a modification of chromatin structure, and finally  ie <dig> was able to modulate nf-κb binding on the tested promoters.

we have been able to show that tnfα treatment increases chromatin accessibility in the proximal area of the tested promoters as demonstrated by histone h <dig> acetylation and the inhibition of hdac <dig> binding. furthermore, the presence of ie <dig> modified chromatin in a different extent depending on the considered promoter. unexpectedly, ie <dig> led to inhibition of chromatin accessibility mediated by tnfα on il- <dig> and icam- <dig> genes, and to an increased accessibility in the context of the iκbα promoter. the inhibition of il- <dig>  and icam- <dig> gene expression could very well be a consequence of the induction of iκbα, since this protein is an inhibitor of nf-κb  <cit> .

nf-κb plays a central role in the innate and adaptive immune response. the activation of this factor during early stages of viral infection leads to the expression of several immune response genes; such as pro-inflammatory cytokines , chemokines  and adhesion molecules . nf-κb also strongly induces mhc-i and cd80/ <dig> expression on antigen presenting cells, thus increasing t-cell activation  <cit> . nf-κb activation appears to be necessary for optimal replication of hsv- <dig> and hcmv early in infection, since it has been shown that blocking the nf-κb pathway decreased viral yields and inhibited the activation of several viral genes harbouring nf-κb response elements in their promoter  <cit> . a model of this interdependence between hcmv and nf-κb has been generated by montag et al.  <cit> . in contrast, the lack of functional nf-κb response elements in the promoters of vzv ie genes allows suspecting that vzv replication cycle could be nf-κb independent. vzv may need to directly interfere with the nf-κb signalling in order to avoid downstream effects of nf-κb activation. likely, nf-κb inhibition properties of vzv could at least in part be mediated by ie <dig>  such a modulation mechanism of nf-κb has already been demonstrated with hcmv. indeed, taylor et al. have shown that hcmv immediate early protein ie <dig> can suppress virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines transcripts expression by efficiently blocking the binding of nf-κb to cellular nf-κb responding genes  <cit> . surprisingly it has been shown that vzv specifically induced interleukin- <dig> in human monocytes via tlr2-dependent activation of nf-κb  <cit> . moreover rahaus et al. have demonstrated that infection by vzv caused a significant increase in activation of jnk/sapk in the early phase of infection and an increase in activation of p38/mapk in the later phase. subsequent cascades to induce pro-inflammatory responses were activated whereas cascades to activate apoptotic events were not  <cit> . this suggests that activation of stress pathways by vzv infection represents a finely regulated system that activates cellular transcription factors for transregulation of vzv-encoded genes, but prevents activation of cellular defence mechanisms  <cit> .

the observation that iκbα transcription was stimulated when ie <dig> expressing cells were treated with tnfα suggests that the strategy by which vzv, may be via ie <dig>  inhibits the nf-κb pathway may protect vzv-infected cells from antiviral responses induced by exogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines, many of which act through nf-κb signalling pathways.

one of the main information brought by this work is the capacity of the ie <dig> to exert epigenetic effects on nf-κb regulated promoters. similar effects on chromatin have been observed with other α-herpsvirus. indeed, in hsv- <dig> infected cells, icp <dig>  the homologue of vzv orf <dig> protein, has been shown to block viral genes silencing by interacting with hdac <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the us <dig> kinase  can also block this silencing in a mechanism distinct from that of icp <dig>  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that during lytic infection hsv- <dig> is associated with histone bearing modifications that correlate with active transcription  <cit> , icp <dig> may be responsible for this chromatin permissiveness. concerning the bovine herpesvirus  <dig> , it has been shown that bicp <dig> can associate with hdac <dig> to relieve hdac1-mediated repression of viral gene transcription  <cit> . furthermore, this protein was able to interact with p300/cbp  and this interaction cooperate to enhance viral gene expression and may interfere with antiviral signalling  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this work clearly demonstrated that stable expression of ie <dig> in two cellular backgrounds only affected the basal expression of a rather limited number of genes while it differentially modulated the tnfα-inducibility of several nf-κb-regulated genes. while the molecular mechanisms governing these effects are not established yet, it can be suspected that ie <dig> is a major player in the complex interplay between vzv and the host immune system.
