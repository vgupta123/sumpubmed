BACKGROUND
the domestication of cattle   <dig> - <dig>  years ago  <cit>  had a significant impact on human civilization. since that time, a broad range of either natural as well as man made factors  has led to diversity in cattle: today we know more than  <dig> cattle breeds across the world. the cattle genome therefore represents a significant opportunity for identifying genetic variation that contributes to phenotypic diversity and for detecting genome response to strong directional selection from both domestication and subsequent artificial selection.

recently a number of studies with different analytical concepts have been conducted to detect signals of recent positive selection on a genome-wide scale in cattle . the methods used are based either on the allele frequency spectrum or on properties of haplotypes segregating in populations. for example, comparing fst values among loci provides an estimate of how much genetic variability exists between, rather than within, populations  <cit> . this statistic assumes that geographically variable selective forces favor different variants in different regions. hence, between-population allele frequency differences may be more extreme in genome regions harboring such variants. the method can be used to scan patterns of variation over many loci. akey et al.   <cit>  suggested using the loci in the tails of the empirical distribution as candidate targets of selection. another approach to infer evidence of past selection is the "extended haplotype homozygosity"  test  <cit>  which identifies regions with an unusually long range of haplotype and a high population frequency. voight et al.   <cit>  developed the "integrated haplotype score" , an extension of ehh, based on the comparison of ehh between derived and ancestor alleles within a population. in this concept, directional selection favoring a new mutation results in a rapid increase in the frequency of the selected allele along with the background haplotype in which the mutation arose. this phenomenon increases linkage disequilibrium  on the chromosomes which harbor the derived  allele, but not the unselected allele, which therefore acts as a "control". thus, this measure is most sensitive to a rapid increase in the frequency of the derived allele at a selected site, but the derived allele must have existed only on a distinct background  prior to selection and must not have reached fixation yet  <cit> . after fixation, the |ihs| statistic may continue to identify regions of high ld surrounding the selected site, but may not detect selection at the selected region itself because fixation will eliminate variation at and near the selected site.

in this study we scan the genome of a diverse set of cattle breeds including dairy and beef breeds based on the  <dig> k snp panel. besides identifying selection footprints common to all breeds, these analyses examine how divergent directions of positive selection may have affected the genomic pattern of those breeds. our analyses focus primarily on two haplotype and site frequency based statistics: the |ihs| and fst statistics. these tests were chosen because previous power analyses suggest they are largely complementary--|ihs| has good power to detect selective sweeps at moderate frequency, while in contrast, fst is most powerful to detect selection on fixed variation  <cit> . applying the |ihs| test with a new bayesian method of fst, we report a panel of  <dig> regions putatively subject to recent positive selection confirming the higher differentiation index and longer haplotype consistency for a strong qtl recently detected in holstein cattle.

RESULTS

we compared the extent of ld among breeds. in order to visualize the decay of ld we plotted r <dig> as a function of inter-marker distance . as expected, the level of pair-wise ld as measured by r <dig> decreases with marker distance within each breed. the decrease is more or less pronounced across the different breeds up to a rather high average value  at large distances .

signatures of positive selection revealed by |ihs|
to identify genomic regions that may have been targets of recent selection, we calculated |ihs| for each snp across the genome of the breeds in the first data set. to facilitate comparisons of genomic regions either within dairy and beef groups or across breeds we split the genome into non-overlapping segments of  <dig> kb and averaged, in each segment, the |ihs| scores over the snps located in each window.  <dig> kb was chosen as the window size so as to have a sufficient number of snps in a window. figure  <dig> presents the distribution of the average number of snps in windows sliding over the genome of breeds in data set i. we chose this length because of the longer extent of ld in cattle compared to humans, in which the window length used is commonly around  <dig> kb  <cit> .

we tested  <dig> and  <dig> sliding windows in beef and dairy groups respectively, involving a total of 49' <dig> |ihs| values. the mean |ihs| value was  <dig>  and the highest estimated value was  <dig>  for a region on chromosome  <dig> in bs. across breeds, a total of  <dig> extreme windows exceeded the |ihs| value  <dig>  with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> outliers in hs, bs, aa, hr and si, respectively .

in order to visualize the chromosomal distribution of outlier signals, we plotted the |ihs| statistic against the genomic position for all breeds . a panel of clustered signals representing strong evidence for selective sweeps appeared in a number of breeds. we found evidence of selective sweeps in two regions in hs and two regions in bs. there were also five distinct clusters of |ihs| signals across the genome of aa and four clusters in hr. the clustered signals also overlapped among breeds in some cases . the regions with clustered signals reflect high values of ld and a slower decay of haplotype homozygosity for a long stretch around the alleles undergoing selection. it is evident that the signals are non-uniformly distributed across chromosomes and chromosome segments.

to gain insight into the reliability of our analysis, we compared the |ihs| scores between angus populations in australia and canada and the united states. to this purpose genotypes from  <dig> north american angus were used. because of the smaller sample size and subsequently a larger number of excluded loci  only 18' <dig> snps were left for further analyses. of the total of 12' <dig> snps common between ca and aa, only  <dig> |ihs| scores overlapped in the 10% upper tail of the empirical distribution, thus basically indicating no major overlap of the regions detected to be under selection.

to assess the background of this result we conducted a cross-validation test  <cit>  regarding the accuracy of |ihs| scores in the holstein cattle. for this, the holstein data set was split at random into two data sets, and |ihs| scores calculated from both data sets were found to be in very good agreement . the discordance observed in the two angus populations could be due to the sparser inter-marker intervals in the north american angus which may lead to inefficient estimates of |ihs| scores. however, this difference can also be caused by a different genetic composition of the two populations as well as by different selection pressures in the two environments.

exploring the differentiated loci
we then investigated evidence for positive selection by assessing variation in allele frequency among populations, using the new bayesian method proposed by gianola et al.   <cit> . data set ii was used for this purpose. several comparisons were made, varying the breeds and the sets of snps that were included. summarized pairwise population comparisons of fst values are shown in table  <dig>  the fst values varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  which at the extreme represent identity  or fixation of alleles in different populations . the mean posterior distribution of fst values between dairy breeds and between beef breeds respectively, was different from that between dairy and beef breeds. fst between hs and ca was estimated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and between ca and pi as  <dig>  ±  <dig> . fixation index estimated between two dairy breeds, hs and bs, was  <dig>  ±  <dig> .

 <dig> number of clusters

 <dig> number of snps with largest fst values representing the first cluster of loci

in a further step estimates of fst values  per locus were clustered into groups. the expectation was that these clusters might be representative of different processes taking place in the populations such as balancing or directional selection, neutrality or any other specific process. the structure of clustering was explored by fitting a sequence of finite mixture models to the means of posterior distribution of fst values for each locus. mixture model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood via the expectation-maximization algorithm in the flexmix package  <cit>  in the r project. results of mixture model analysis, by number of clusters favored by the average information criterion  and the number of loci representing the first cluster  in each comparison, are shown in table  <dig>  in a breed-by-breed comparison of fst, loci were classified into  <dig> to  <dig> clusters, possibly reflecting selection footprints left by different evolutionary forces.

to determine if recent selection was responsible for the differences in allele frequencies between dairy and beef breeds, we examined fst among hs and bs versus ca and pi. in total,  <dig> % of the posterior fst means among the  <dig> populations were <  <dig> ,  <dig> % of the fst values were equal to or greater than  <dig>  and the average fst was  <dig> . using akaike's information criterion as a gauge for model comparison, genome-wide estimates of fst were clustered into two groups, one representing 19' <dig> putatively neutral loci, and another one included 21' <dig> loci possibly corresponding to genomic regions affected by selection .

to address this in some further detail, we partitioned the holstein population randomly into two sub-populations, then estimated fst and plotted the densities. as shown in figure 5b, fst values between two sub-populations of no divergence derived from the same breed resulted only in a unimodal distribution indicating a uniform mode of selection over all evaluated loci.

signatures of selection can be recognized when adjacent snps all show high fst, due to the hitch-hiking effect, implying divergent selection between breeds, or where adjacent snps all show low fst, implying balancing selection between breeds. therefore, to facilitate comparisons of genomic regions within or across dairy and beef groups and to reduce locus-to-locus variation in the inference of selection we averaged the fst values into the non-overlapping windows of  <dig> kb across the genome. evidence of the positive selection was assumed for windows in the extreme  <dig> % of the empirical distribution which resulted in  <dig> significant windows .

to identify differentiated windows between dairy and beef genomic background pairwise fst comparisons denoted as hs-an, hs-pi, bs-an and bs-pi were examined and plotted across the genome . all in all, 29% of the genomic windows with a differentiation index >  <dig>  overlapped in the four breed comparisons. bovine chromosome   <dig> with  <dig> windows covering  <dig>  of the chromosome and bta <dig> with  <dig> windows spanning on  <dig>  of the chromosome presented the largest and smallest degree of differentiation in the genome. figure  <dig> depicts the genome wide map of fst windows indicating the genomic position of the most diverse regions.

genomic annotation
we investigated the genomic regions containing extreme |ihs| and fst values using the fourth draft of bovine genome sequence assembly . a subset of genes and ests located in each region were identified. we screened this list for the biologically most interesting candidate genes in each region. table  <dig> summarizes the statistic estimated as well as the list of genes for  <dig> genomic regions presenting the most extreme peaks across breeds. some regions overlapped with genes previously suggested being under selection. for example on chromosome  <dig> in the holstein population, an outlier of |ihs| scores was in the interval  <dig> - <dig>  mb. this interval contains sialic acid binding ig-like lectin  <dig> and zinc finger protein  <dig> genes which recently were reported as candidates to have a strong effect on productive life and fertility traits in holstein cattle  <cit> .

the window with the largest |ihs| value  was observed in bs spanning  <dig> - <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes/ests in this region, ugdh  may be a possible candidate to affect feed efficiency traits. another strong |ihs| cluster which harbors the somatostatin  gene was observed on chromosome  <dig> in hr. strong evidence of a sweep reflected by a set of windows was observed in the region 80- <dig> mb of bta <dig> in the vicinity of the srd5a <dig> gene. the enzyme steroid 5-alpha-reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone and a polymorphism in this gene was shown to moderately increase the proportion of progressively motile spermatozoa in normozoospermic men  <cit> . we also found four clusters of outliers on bta <dig> and bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> which overlapped among some beef breeds.

discussion
the high level of observed phenotypic variation among domestic cattle is a result of both neutral demographic processes, weak but sustained natural selection and strong short-term artificial selection for divergent breeding goals. the task of separating these processes and identifying genes under the influence of artificial selection can be challenging. the efforts to identify genes affected by selection have so far been concentrated on species with well-characterized genomes, such as drosophila and humans  <cit> . the cattle genome offers an opportunity to test the power of genome-wide analyses, as it has extensive ld  <cit>  caused by intensive selection, and it is expected that selection footprints would be correlated with genes affecting production traits or fitness. however, it must be noticed that extensive ld can also result from other causes, like admixture or genetic drift, both factors being prevalent in farm animal populations and thus making the detection of selection signatures a challenge.

in this study we presented an application of two complementary statistics of selection signatures in a diverse set of dairy and beef breeds. in the first step, regions of the genome that contained targets of putative positive selection revealed by long range ld were defined as windows in the extreme of the empirical distribution of the |ihs| statistic. this criterion resulted in  <dig> significant windows . these signals generally differ from those reported by the bovine hapmap consortium  <cit> . this is probably due to the differences in sample size and marker densities between studies which both could limit accurate estimates of |ihs|. mapping the corresponding genomic regions to the cattle genome sequence resulted in a large number of adjacent loci. the list of genes with signatures of positive selection was significantly enlarged by those involved in the biological processes such as anatomical structure development, muscle development, metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, spermatogenesis and fertilization. we refined the complete list for the most important genes in the region of clustered signals that may have functional relevance for economic traits. a notable observation in this study is a strong selection signal confirmed by both |ihs| and fst analyses in the vicinity of sialic acid binding ig-like lectin  <dig> gene on bta <dig>  this qtl was recently reported to have large effects on calving ease, several conformation traits, longevity, and total merit in holstein cattle  <cit> . we observed that other haplotypes present in this region display a shorter extent of homozygosity, indicating abundant historical recombination . therefore, the long stretch of homozygosity observed in this region presumably is not simply due to a low local recombination rate but presumably reflects the combination of strong and recent selective pressure, pushing the beneficial mutation rapidly towards high frequency with a long conserved haplotype surrounding it. although the low heritability of most of the aforementioned traits has not made them a primary breeding goal in selection programs, it could be hypothesized that applying sustained but weak negative selection against these traits has increased the frequency of favorable alleles and surrounding haplotypes in the holstein population.

a cluster of signals reflecting strong evidence of selection was also observed in the vicinity of the somatostatin gene on bta <dig>  we also found clusters of outliers which overlapped among some beef breeds . these results show a panel of interesting candidate genes such as spata <dig>  mgat <dig>  pgrmc <dig> and srd5a <dig> in the region of clustered signals which belong to a number of functional categories relevant to reproduction, including gamete generation, embryo development and spermatogenesis, and genes in these categories may be strong candidates for selection for fertility traits. these results generally are consistent with the observations of flori et al.   <cit> . another interesting observation was the strong evidence for selection in the region of genes related to muscle formation  in beef breeds. for example polymorphisms in the genes encoding actinin are among the best characterized athletic-performance associated variants in human endurance athletes  <cit> . evidence for positive selection in the genomic region surrounding muscle related genes has also been reported in racing horses  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . the presence of genes like actinin, collagen and fibroblast activation protein as well as the gene responsible for developing cartilage rudiments in positively selected regions in beef cattle  supports the supposition that selection for muscle related phenotypes has played a major role in the shaping the beef cattle. a better understanding of the role these genes play in the development, strength and integrity of muscles may contribute to improved knowledge of musculoskeletal traits and developing new marker systems for beef cattle breeding. consistency of our observations with previous reports  <cit>  may suggest general themes about the types of genes that have been targets of positive selection in cattle.

we also optimized a new bayesian approach for exploring the level of genetic differentiation to infer the selection signatures against the genome as a whole. this algorithm is able to deal with a large battery of marker information via probabilistic clustering of fst values. after examining fst among hs and bs versus ca and pi breeds using akaike's information criterion it appears likely that genome-wide estimates of fst are clustered into two groups, one representing putatively neutral loci, and another one  corresponding to genomic regions affected by selection. annotation of the genes underlying the regions with extreme fst does not appear to reveal many strong candidates for positive selection with the possible exception of the smcp and fgf <dig> genes . a receptor of the latter gene  showed evidence of selection in a genome-wide sweep mapping study using fst among dog breeds  <cit> . this gene is responsible for achondroplasia  in humans. as an explanation we suggest that selection may work on genes that were not considered the primary targets of selection so far. some extreme peaks were observed in presumed gene deserts which may reflect selection acting on uncharacterized regulatory regions or simply fixation of non-coding dna by genetic drift.

we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> significant fst values lie in poor gene content regions, defined by the frequency of coding sequences in the bracket of  <dig> mb surrounding the fst signal. to test whether this observation is a systematic deviation from the expected, we sampled  <dig> random positions with matching frequencies on the chromosomes, i.e. since  <dig> significant fst values were observed on bta <dig>  we also sampled  <dig> random positions on that chromosome. of these  <dig> random positions,  <dig> were positioned in regions with poor gene content applying the same definition. the difference was tested with a χ <dig> test revealing a significant difference on the  <dig> per cent error level.

this observation is consistent with the studies of flori et al.   <cit> , and gu et al.   <cit>  which reported fst signals in poor gene content regions in genome wide analyses of cattle and thoroughbred horse, respectively. thus, these results in combination with the observations from voight et al.   <cit> , carlson et al.   <cit>  and wang et al.   <cit>  on human population data suggest that non-coding regions may have been important for adaptive evolution.

we examined the validity of fst analysis by testing ten candidate major genes in our data set. the results revealed fst values larger than expected  for regions harboring the casein cluster, ghr, sts, lp, igf- <dig> and mstn genes which are supposed to be targets of artificial selection. the observation of selection evidence in the region of the ghr gene on bta <dig> is consistent with the reports of flori et al.   <cit>  and hayes et al.   <cit> , the latter based on a study comparing angus and holstein. the presence of the longer than expected haplotype homozygosity in this region was also observed in holstein cattle  <cit> . two regions on bta <dig> and bta <dig> in the vicinity of zranb <dig>  r3hdm <dig> and wif <dig> genes known to affect feed efficiency and mammalian mesoderm segmentation, respectively  <cit> , also matched with the outlier fst windows in our study.

overall, the average fst of dairy vs. beef breeds was equal to  <dig>  which is substantially higher than the differentiation index reported previously between holstein and angus  <cit> . the higher average of fst as well as the similar pair-wise fst within dairy and beef breeds might reflect the dominating influence of a substantial number of fixed snps in the pair-wise comparisons of breeds and groups.

the two metrics applied yielded a total of  <dig> regions putatively subject to positive selection. to investigate how frequently selective events were unique or shared between methods, we assessed the number of overlapping signals. a panel of  <dig> significant signals was overlapping . interestingly, most of these were found in holstein cattle, which may reflect a comparatively higher pressure of selective breeding in this breed.

overall, comparing our scan for selection with the results of previous genome-wide studies revealed a modest overlap with some notable exceptions. different hypotheses can be proposed to explain these incongruities. from the methodological point of view, a possible reason could be due to the differences in the computational analyses between the studies. in other words, the statistical tests used in each study are recovering selective events from different time periods and/or for different stages of the selective sweep. even for tests that should detect similar types of selective events , low statistical power further decreases the probability of overlap  <cit> . in addition, most studies report only the most significant results . therefore, the results presented in this study are probably a conservative estimate of overlap between studies.

population demographic history can also impart similar patterns on dna sequence variation, making inferences on selection difficult. for example, population expansion can lead to an excess of low frequency alleles compared with the number expected under the standard neutral model. likewise, recent positive selection for a putative mutation may have started from a higher initial frequency of beneficial alleles  <cit> . such an allele might e.g. be imported into a breed through crosses with other breeds. in such a case beneficial alleles may be included in diverse haplotypes and ld based estimators would not be able to trace the selection signature. crossbreeding can also generate false selection signatures, if e.g. a large conserved piece of a chromosome from another breed is mixed with many shorter segments from the original breed.

from the technical point of view, the density of the markers is also critical for the power of such studies and could be a source of discrepancy. it was shown earlier with ld based analyses that core regions are more likely to appear where the marker density is greater than the average  <cit> . this would imply that the availability of genotyping arrays with an increased genome-wide marker density  will allow a more reliable and comprehensive screening of the genome for signatures of selection by ld based tests. moreover, although sliding window analyses facilitate inferences of selection by reducing locus-to-locus variation, the size of the window is often subjectively determined which can influence the final results and interpretations. one potential refinement would be to adjust window sizes to local levels of ld  <cit> , although it remains unclear how to account for varying levels of ld between populations. finally, the incongruities can also result from a lack of power given the sample size available for some of the breeds in this study, and complex genomic interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study genomic scans based on site frequency and haplotype data led to the detection of  <dig> regions putatively subject to recent positive selection in the cattle genome. our results confirmed the higher differentiation index as well as the longer than expected haplotype consistency in the vicinity of sialic acid binding ig-like lectin  <dig> gene on bta <dig>  which was recently reported as a strong qtl in the holstein cattle  <cit> . however, the overlap between the identified regions via |ihs| with previous studies is modest. analysis of population differentiation revealed signatures of selection occurring in poor gene content regions, which may reflect selection acting on uncharacterized regulatory regions or simply fixation of non-coding dna by genetic drift due to the absence of any selection. besides issues like functionally characterizing suspected targets of selection and identifying causal genes driving signatures of selection observed across large genomic regions, the major challenge remains in developing robust and efficient methods to distinguish true signals from those due to genetic drift. this is especially a challenge for farm animal breeds with small effective population size and thus a considerable impact of genetic drift. one possible solution could be to analyze multiple separate populations with similar breeding goals, hypothesizing that true signal due to selection would overlap across the genomes.

independent confirmation studies with larger sample sizes and/or higher snp densities as well as comparisons with other breeds are required as soon as suitable data are available. further studies should also try to map selection signatures on sex chromosomes, and an attempt should be made to identify gene networks rather than single genes underlying the observed pattern of selection signatures. our results may be of future interest for identifying signatures of recent positive artificial selection between the cattle breeds or as additional evidence for any polymorphism that shows associations with beef, milk, or functional traits.
