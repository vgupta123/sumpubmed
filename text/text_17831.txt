BACKGROUND
the integron includes a site-specific recombination system that integrates and expresses genes present on mobile elements called gene cassettes  <cit> . the integron platform is defined by three characteristics: an integrase gene  whose product encodes a site-specific integrase, inti, an attachment site  at which point dna sequences are inserted and a promoter  which expresses genes within the gene cassettes inserted at atti  <cit> . gene cassettes can be inserted into the integron as individual units but multiple events can lead to large tandem arrays. integrons are best known for their role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in clinical environments  <cit> . these clinical integrons harbour 1- <dig> gene cassettes and are often associated with mobile elements such as resistance plasmids and transposons  <cit> . however, integrons are diverse genetic elements found in approximately 10% of environmental bacteria  <cit> . in these bacteria, integrons are found in chromosomal locations and rarely carry antibiotic resistance gene cassettes indicating a general role in evolution.

vibrio is a genus of highly adaptable bacteria found in diverse marine-associated niches  <cit> . this adaptability is partly driven by lateral gene transfer , a process believed to be particularly important in this genus since the recent finding that vibrio cholerae and other vibrios naturally take up dna from the environment  <cit> . in the vibrio, integron cassette arrays can comprise well in excess of  <dig> cassettes  <cit> . thus, the integron is a significant source of laterally acquired dna in vibrio consisting of 1-3% of the total genome and generates genetic diversity even among closely related strains  <cit> . for example, it is the only identified genomic region that differs between some strains responsible for the current v. cholerae pandemic  <cit> . it has also been recently suggested that integron associated gene pools in the vibrios are important in adaptation to local environmental and ecological conditions  <cit> .

recent additional studies have provided new insight into the biology of vibrio integrons. the sos stress response induces transcription of the integron-integrase increasing the rate of insertion, excision and shuffling of gene cassettes  <cit> . furthermore, the majority of gene cassettes in a 116-cassette array  <cit>  located in the vibrio rotiferianus strain dat <dig>  <cit>  were found to be transcribed due to the presence of promoters distributed throughout the array  <cit> . thus, cassette transcription is not absolutely dependent on being near pc. collectively these findings suggest the integron provides a more prominent role in vibrio adaptation than previously thought.

approximately 75% of integron associated gene cassette products in vibrio species are novel with the remainder being designated with a putative function based on the presence of known domains through in silico analysis  <cit>  or, to a very limited extent, by protein structural analysis  <cit> . the novelty of gene cassette products has made them difficult targets to study. however, like most mobile dna, gene cassettes are believed to provide their host with accessory phenotypes imparting a niche-specific advantage. the exemplar of this phenomenon is antibiotic resistance, where most of the genes driving resistance adaptation are highly mobile  <cit> . this has also been supported by the handful of novel gene cassettes that have been characterised proving them to be functional and include genes potentially involved in pathogenesis in v. cholerae  <cit> . it is easy to understand how a protein carrying out a single biochemical reaction, for example the chemical inactivation of an antibiotic, can act in isolation and confer a strong selective advantage when the containing cell is in an environment where a toxic compound is present. this argument can also be extended to self contained sets of genes  that encode pathways conferring resistance to such things as mercury and chromate which have also been captured and spread by mobilizing elements. it is largely believed that highly mobile genes would be confined to such function-types since laterally acquired genes that influence core metabolic functions are likely to lower fitness when first captured  <cit> . however we show here that at least one of eight novel cassettes associated with a vibrio integron encodes a product that is integrated into cell membrane porin regulation such that its loss would impact on cell fitness under physiological conditions that would normally be encountered by the free living host.

RESULTS
deletion of cassettes reduces growth on some carbon sources
to investigate how cassette genes may influence adaptation in their bacterial host, deletions of cassettes were created in the integron cassette array of vibrio rotiferianus dat <dig>  two cassette deletion mutants within the 116-gene cassette array of vibrio rotiferianus dat <dig> were created . these mutants removed cassettes 8- <dig>  in one case and cassettes 16- <dig>  in the other. the ability of these mutants to grow in various media were tested and compared to the wild type parent . it was found that both mutants were able to grow normally in a complete medium  albeit with a slightly extended lag phase for d8-60a . the two mutants were also examined for growth in marine minimal medium  with glucose  or pyruvate  as a sole carbon source. the growth of both mutants was normal compared to wild type  in 2m + glucose as was also the case for d16- <dig> in pyruvate. in contrast, d8-60a grew very poorly with pyruvate as sole carbon source. growth of this mutant however could be restored on pyruvate with the addition of glycine-betaine, a known osmoprotectant . glucose is also known to be a better osmoprotectant than pyruvate and we therefore tentatively conclude that the poor growth of d8-60a in pyruvate is a result of intolerance to osmotic changes and not a failure to extract carbon from this molecule. further growth experiments supported this hypothesis with growth on other carbon sources that osmoprotect  compared to failure to grow on other non-osmoprotectants  . these data suggested that this cassette array may include encoded proteins that integrate into and influence cellular processes more broadly in contrast to possessing proteins involved in single step secondary metabolism. specifically, in dat <dig>  at least one cassette product appears to influence normal growth under nutrient conditions analogous to those found in seawater, the natural free-living environment for vibrio rotiferianus.

to confirm that the dramatic reduction in fitness of d8-60a was a result of the loss of a mobile cassette and not the consequence of a spontaneous mutation elsewhere in the genome of the isolate selected for analysis, two other independent mutants, d8-60b and d8-60c, comprising loss of the same cassettes were constructed and examined for their growth characteristics. the results for these two mutants showed significant growth impairment in minimal medium although not in a manner identical to d8-60a. in glucose, both d8-60b and d8-60c had significant lag phases of up to  <dig> hours compared to wild type dat <dig> and d8-60a but thereafter grew to achieve wild type cell densities at  <dig> hours . in pyruvate, d8-60b and d8-60c showed reduced growth rates compared to dat <dig> although they were significantly better than d8-60a .

all three d8- <dig> mutants generated a minority of microcolonies when streaked on lb <dig> complete medium . this suggested that the mutants had an overall reduced fitness that was strongly selective for mutants that compensated for loss of a function encoded within the region deleted. the nature of these compensating mutations may thus explain the variability of growth seen between mutants in minimal medium. in support of the notion that compensating mutations were being selected out was the observation that cells recovered from microcolonies that showed enhanced growth showed wild type equivalent growth in minimal medium + glucose. this is shown in cell lines d8-60b-s and d8-60c-s in figure 2d. taking these data together we suggest that an integron associated cassette product participates in some aspect of cell metabolism that directly or indirectly impacts on growth such that a secondary mutation is required to maintain viability or growth. this product must be encoded by one of the genes located in cassettes  <dig> to  <dig> inclusive since the smaller deletion encompassing cassettes 16- <dig> does not display any of these effects .

cassette deletions change the outermembrane protein profiles of cells
porins play a major role in controlling the permeability of the outermembrane of gram-negative bacteria. changes in porin composition affect the cell's osmotic balance and nutrient transport  <cit> . therefore, it was hypothesized that the likely osmotic shock of d8-60a in 2m + pyruvate and the growth defects of d8-60b and d8-60c in 2m + glucose might be due to changes in the composition of outermembrane porins. outermembrane protein profiles showed significant changes in the composition of porins in all three d8- <dig> mutants compared to the wild-type using different growth media indicating an inability of these mutants to regulate their porins normally . in 2m + glucose conditions, d8-60a showed slight decreases in four proteins identified as vapa , maltoporin , ompu porin  and an ompu-like porin  compared to the wild-type, consistent with the healthy growth of d8-60a in this medium . however, the changes in regulation of porins in d8-60a was clearly observed when grown in 2m + lb nutrients as it showed increased amounts of vapa  and maltoporin  and the presence of a putative porin  not detected in the wild-type under these nutrient conditions . this irregular regulation explained the inability for d8-60a to grow in 2m salts without the presence of an osmoprotectant such as glycine-betaine or glucose to restore the osmotic balance.

the mutants d8-60b and d8-60c had very similar porin profiles, a result consistent with the similar growth phenotypes displayed by these mutants. in 2m + pyruvate conditions, a significant down-regulation of the maltoporin  and the ompu-like porin  but an up-regulation of ompu  was observed when compared to the wild-type . in 2m + lb nutrient medium, these mutants had reduced levels of the maltoporin  and the presence of the putative porin  protein in replacement of the ompu-like porin  compared to the wild-type .

expression of a single gene cassette in trans maintains normal growth after generation of strains with deleted cassettes
since mutant d16- <dig>  had normal growth phenotypes compared to the wild-type, at least one cassette gene located between cassettes  <dig> and  <dig> has a strong pleiotropic affect. all eight cassettes within this region, except cassette  <dig>  encode small hypothetical proteins with homology only to other cassette proteins. therefore, nothing could be inferred regarding their putative function. however, cassette  <dig> includes a gene, encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein with pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ identifying two domains; 1) an uncharacterized nerd domain at residues 31- <dig> that has weak homology to nucleases and is commonly associated with other protein domains involved in dna processing  <cit> , 2) a dna-binding c4-zinc finger domain at residues 216- <dig> found in topoisomerase i proteins and involved in removing excessive negative supercoils from dna  <cit> . based on this bioinformatics analysis one possible biochemical function of the cassette  <dig> gene product is as a dna topoisomerase. in addition, experiments with a mutated topoisomerase i  gene have described phenotypes that are similar to those observed in the d8- <dig> mutants. most notably, in characterized topa mutants, this includes the requirement for a compensatory mutation, emergence of spontaneous mutants and alterations in the composition of outermembrane porin proteins  <cit> .

to test for the cassette  <dig> gene product being responsible for the phenotype of the mutants described above, the plasmid pmaq <dig> was constructed which comprises only this cassette gene cloned into the vector pjak <dig> . pmaq <dig> was then transformed into the merodiploid strain md <dig>  md <dig> has a complete dat <dig> cassette array and is the strain that was used to create the original deletion mutants . md7/pmaq <dig> possesses a phenotype identical to that of dat <dig> with respect to porin profiles and growth in lb <dig> and 2m media. from this strain, a deletion mutant was created, dat722Δ/pmaq <dig> with the same cassettes deleted as strains d8-60a, b and c. the strain dat722Δ/pmaq <dig> had no major growth defect  and possessed a wild type outermembrane protein profile in all tested media . a slight decrease in growth rate was observed in 2m + pyruvate , which may be explained by the up-regulation of a protein  that is likely due to cassette  <dig> being removed from its native promoter.

discussion
the integron/gene cassette system is broadly dispersed amongst the proteobacteria and is found in about 10% of sequenced genomes  <cit> . in the vibrios it is ubiquitous with arrays generally being especially large. despite the fact that the integron gene cassette "metagenome" pool is very large  <cit> , little is known about what the encoded proteins do beyond the enormous contribution some cassette proteins make to the antibiotic resistance problem  <cit> . a conventional understanding of cell metabolism would suggest they encode accessory phenotypes providing their host with a niche-specific advantage. antibiotic resistance is a classic example of this since cassettes containing antibiotic resistance genes quite clearly provide a selective advantage in clinical environments where antibiotics are frequently used  <cit> . these highly mobilized genes frequently cross phylogenetic boundaries and a single gene can protect a cell from toxic compounds irrespective of the metabolic context in which it finds itself. the same phenomenon can extend to some adaptive genes that are part of a "self contained" unit as is the case, for example, in operons on transposons that confer mercury resistance  <cit> .

the vibrios represent a diverse group of marine organisms and members of this group have very large cassette arrays. a typical vibrio cassette array comprises more than  <dig> novel genes  <cit> . moreover, they represent the most dynamic component of the genome. in v. cholerae, pandemic strains that are otherwise indistinguishable by most phylogenetic typing techniques can still have very disparate cassette arrays  <cit> . similarly, this is true for enclosed symbiotic communities of vibrios  <cit> . this highly mobile pool of genes, in a metagenomic sense, therefore number in at least the thousands and probably orders of magnitude more  <cit> . what do all these genes do? many probably comprise functions that are metabolically independent of the rest of the cell in a manner analogous to antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes. however, we show for the first time, that at least one mobile gene product can influence other aspects of core cell metabolism. in dat <dig> this influence is such that at least one gene within the deleted region is highly adapted to this cell line to the extent that its loss reduces fitness to the point where the host cell is barely viable. the target gene or genes was contained to within a contiguous set of eight cassettes within the dat <dig> array. each of these cassettes contained a single predicted protein . all of the predicted proteins are novel in that identical proteins are not present in any other known bacterium. further, seven of the eight predicted proteins are highly novel to the point where they can only be described as hypothetical proteins. the remaining predicted protein, derived from cassette  <dig>  is also novel although it contains a domain related to the dna topoisomerase i family of proteins.

although the precise function of this cassette protein needs to be established experimentally, the data generated was consistent with the hypothesis that the cassette  <dig> gene product was integrated into an essential cell network in the wild type dat <dig>  in particular, the fact that supplying this product alone in trans via pmaq <dig> preserved the wild type phenotype after subsequent deletion of cassettes  <dig> -  <dig> unambiguously points to an essential role in the cell porin regulatory network.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, this study emphasizes the importance of lgt in bacterial evolution and that this process can bring rapid adaptation not only through acquisition of novel functional genes, but more importantly through gain of genes that alter a cell's regulatory network. thus, mobile genes can be adaptive over very short time scales such that their loss can threaten the viability of the cell through the disruption of a core metabolic process. this is in contrast to the generally held view that mobile dna contributes to cell fitness by providing additional protein/s that act largely independently of core cell networks. also, this data reinforces the point that large integron arrays are not solely dependent on pc for transcription since this cluster of genes if relatively distal to this promoter. it is clear therefore that despite the enormous increase in genomics and proteomic data in recent years, much is still to be learnt about the full of gamut of proteins necessary for important cell metabolic processes.
