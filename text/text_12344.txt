BACKGROUND
recent work has described the abundance of copy number variants  in the human genome  <cit> . not only have these studies demonstrated the presence of cnvs in apparently healthy individuals, and hence their considerable contribution to overall genetic variation, they have also shown cnvs to be an important contributor to susceptibility to complex disease  <cit> .

a variety of different methods are available for the detection of genomic copy number changes  each with their own advantages and disadvantages with respect to resolution, accuracy, applicability to large-scale studies and cost. methods for copy number measurement can generally be divided into two broad categories: those that are suitable for global detection of novel variants  as illustrated by  <cit> , and more targeted methods that measure copy number at a particular locus, or relatively small number of loci, in a targeted population of probands   <cit> .

multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation  is a versatile and simple semi-quantitative method for direct determination of dna copy number  <cit> . the method relies on the fact that amplifiable probes can be hybridised to genomic dna fixed onto a nylon membrane, stringently washed, and then amplified so that the amount of amplified product is directly proportional to the copy number in the genomic dna. each amplifiable probe is a different length so that the probes can be resolved by electrophoresis. maph probes are also insensitive to substitutional polymorphisms making them highly suitable for copy number measurement. in addition, maph's multiplicity and flexible resolution means it is a method highly suited to accurate high resolution copy number screening.

to date, copy number measurement by maph has utilised a single set of probes, consisting of specifically designed amplicons cloned into a single vector, that measure the relative copy number of up to  <dig> targets simultaneously  <cit> . in order to screen for potential copy number changes at a greater number of loci simultaneously, we have introduced a novel scheme for probe generation, and developed the maph technology to use probe sets in a four-fold multiplex, here termed "quadmaph". this format has been particularly designed to allow thorough copy-number screening of 100- <dig> kb regions , at high  resolution in large numbers of genomic dna samples from selected cohorts. in this report we describe the development of a quadmaph screening method applied to a genomic region of over  <dig> kb around the msh <dig> gene.

RESULTS
to generate a large number of maph probes within a specified region, restriction enzyme digestion of isolated bac dna was carried out to produce hundreds of fragments spanning a range of sizes. the individual combination of enzymes was selected of the basis of computer generated restriction enzyme prediction from the bac sequence  available on request). the digest simulation was used not only to predict the proportion of fragments that would be usable as maph probes but also the location of the usable probes with respect to bac sequence to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the region of interest. the alui, haeiii, rsai digest simulation of bac rp11-1084a <dig> predicted that from a total of  <dig>  fragments,  <dig> would be usable. of the unusable fragments,  <dig> were considered to be too short  and  <dig> too long . among the  <dig> fragments in the 80- <dig> bp range,  <dig> were too at rich  and  <dig> contained more than  <dig> bp of match to a masked repeat.

following cloning,  <dig> colonies were picked from across the four vector systems and subjected to sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.  <dig> fragments satisfied the criteria for being usable maph probes, i.e., single copy,  <dig> to ≈ <dig> base pairs in length and a gc content of 35% or above. the fragments ranged in actual size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and  <dig> to 62% gc. following removal of duplicates in which the same fragment had been cloned more than once ,  <dig> unique probes were accepted. probe sets were assembled, taking into consideration coverage of the msh <dig> region, gc content and range of probe sizes resolvable by capillary electrophoresis. three control probes cloned into pzero <dig> were also included in the set. these consisted of x and y linked probes and a non-human probe. of the  <dig> unique maph probes for msh <dig> generated by this method,  <dig> probes were assembled into an initial quadmaph set to screen the msh <dig> locus at an average resolution of one probe per  <dig>  kb. distribution of msh <dig> probes and coverage of the region from the initial quadmaph set is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

to assess the ability of quadmaph to identify deletion or duplication events, and to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the assay, a direct comparison was made between the hnpcc probe set  <cit>  and our quadmaph set. maph using both probe sets was performed for  <dig> control dna samples and  <dig> dna samples with known msh <dig> exonic deletions, which had been independently characterised by the referring laboratory. example quadmaph traces for an individual heterozygous for exonic deletions of the msh <dig> gene and a control are illustrated in figure  <dig> 

analysis was carried out as previously described  <cit> . briefly, experimental values are normalised relative to other probe results to give a normalised ratio . the normalised ratios can be used as an index of the relative intensity of a given peak in a given sample, and hence be used to detect copy number changes. in the absence of copy number changes, a mean of  <dig> is expected, equivalent to a dosage of two copies per cell. a heterozygous deletion and a heterozygous duplication are expected to result in values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. normalised ratios from control samples approximated well to a normal distribution. the accuracy of measurement by each probe was evaluated by calculating the standard deviation  of the normalised ratio. the mean and sd of the nr values obtained for probes demonstrating diploid dosage and heterozygous deletion are shown in table  <dig>  although individual probes differed in measurement accuracy, the average standard deviation of measurements, as illustrated in table  <dig>  was  <dig>  for hnpcc maph and  <dig>  for quadmaph. assuming a normal  error distribution, this predicts a per test false positive rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for hnpcc maph and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for quadmaph at a threshold of  <dig> +/-  <dig> . for deletion events, we predict a per test false negative rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for hnpcc and quadmaph respectively. for duplication events, we predict a per test false negative rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for hnpcc and quadmaph respectively.

*initial normalisation of all the data included samples which were subsequently scored as deleted for a particular probe, leading to these control samples having an average value that is very slightly greater than  <dig> 

discussion
the use of maph in assessing copy number changes at new loci requires the generation of new probe sets, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process if individual amplicons need to be designed and cloned. since many of the most likely candidates for disease association are in regions of the genome that also contain repeat elements, the positioning of single-copy probes can be problematic. therefore efficient screening of regions for copy number variants by maph has necessitated the development of quadmaph and with it, the introduction of new cloning systems and a new method of generating probes.

previously, maph probes have been made by designing and cloning individual pcr amplicons  <cit> , which is not always appropriate for covering large genomic regions, or if numerous probes are required. in order to screen regions of approximately  <dig> kb in size with a probe approximately every 1- <dig> kb, we have established an alternative approach for maph probe generation, by which sets of probes are prepared by shotgun cloning of random short fragments from a bac clone covering the region of interest. this method of producing maph probes is both efficient and cost-effective with respect to the number of probes generated and can be easily and rapidly applied to new loci which are not covered by commercially available technologies. an important step in the random generation of fragments is the choice of restriction enzymes in the initial bac dna digest, which dictates the number of usable maph probes produced. the use of double stranded linkers allows simultaneous pcr amplification of all fragments generated by this digestion. digested bac dna was subject to two rounds of size-selection, which resulted in a reasonable distribution of fragments in the size range suitable for maph probes and was also necessary to offset any potential bias towards small fragments in the subsequent cloning and transformation steps.

since the clones were generated randomly, unsurprisingly there was a degree of redundancy of fragments between vectors, but this allowed flexibility in the choice of probes for each set, and also produced a reserve of probes that could be used to improve on resolution or to confirm any potential copy number changes. in fact, once a set of clones has been generated, these can be stored in their 96-well microtitre plates at -20°c to -80°c thus providing a collection from which to make additional maph probe sets with minimal additional labour. despite the high density of repetitive elements  at the msh <dig> locus, this approach generated good probe coverage across the region, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  if probe density is not sufficient to interrogate a specific region, then gaps can be filled by custom design of a small number of supplementary probes. custom probes can be cloned into any one of four vectors to fit into size gaps in the profile for the vector chosen.

all four vectors can be multiplexed in any combination or used in maph on their own. therefore, using four cloning systems allows the generation of four independent maph probe sets and subsequently a substantial increase in the number of targets that can be interrogated in a single test. the number of loci that can be analysed at once is determined by the number of probes in the probe set. theoretically, the number of probes per set is only limited by the resolution and the number of fluorophores detectable after capillary electrophoresis, and in the case of generating probes by a random shotgun cloning approach, the size range of probes produced in the initial digest. whilst our initial msh <dig> quadmaph set consisted of  <dig> probes, additional probes can be included. in this work, by choosing an initial copy number screening resolution of a probe every 1- <dig> kb, the boundaries of any copy number variants discovered could then be defined within the range of long pcr, and junction-fragment analysis can be used to establish a rapid, specific pcr assay for the variant.

maph has previously been demonstrated as an accurate and precise assay for measurement of copy number  <cit> . after extensive experimental work dissecting and analysing factors affecting maph's accuracy and robustness, improvements have been made in the working method. pcr cycling modifications, and adherence to a strict wash protocol and wash solutions appropriate to the %gc content of the probe set, have reduced copy number measurement error and improved the reliability and reproducibility of the assay. as a consequence of this, the standard deviations reported here are considerably smaller than those reported by hollox et al  <cit> . associated with this is a substantial reduction in the predicted incidence of false positive and false negative results. the incorporation of control probes within a probe set, such as x and y linked probes and a non-human probe, allow the user to assess non-specific probe binding and adjust washing conditions as necessary, as well as confirm that any copy number changes can be detected accurately based on the responsiveness of the control probes.

by comparison of data obtained by simplex maph with those by quadmaph, we have also demonstrated that multiplexing four probe sets is achieved with no ensuing loss of measurement accuracy, as indicated by the false positive and false negative predictions. although mlpa has been successfully used in a two-colour format  <cit>  these studies examined totals of  <dig> and  <dig> probes respectively, and we are not aware of successful use of mlpa at probe multiplicities approaching those in this report. since mlpa also depends on pairwise ligation of half-probes, there may be a very large number of opportunities for mlpa using a large number of probes and multiple primers to create artefactual products; by contrast, maph probes in different vectors are not expected to interact with one another, and we have shown here that  <dig> probes perform well together. in summary, we believe quadmaph has the capacity to screen large numbers of loci simultaneously on a large number of samples.

CONCLUSIONS
genome wide studies have revealed the extent of copy number variation, but detailed investigation of specific regions creates a different challenge. at the present time, obtaining copy number variation information at the nucleotide level, on a genome-wide scale, in hundreds or thousands of individuals is not a realistic prospect for many investigators. for those who wish to examine copy number variation of a defined region  our four vector systems, combined with quadmaph, constitute an accurate, high-resolution method that allows targeted screening of large numbers of subjects without the expense of genome-wide approaches.
