BACKGROUND
protein regulation by ubiquitination is a highly conserved process in eukaryotic organisms. ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules label proteins for either protein degradation or signalling purposes, and deficiency in the ubiquitination machinery leads to severe pathologies  <cit> . ubiquitination takes place by means of the coordinated action of three different kinds of enzymes: e1s , e2s  and e3s . among all these proteins, the most diverse are the e3-ubiquitin ligases, which are counted by hundreds in humans and confer high specificity to the process  <cit> . this group is further divided into three subfamilies, hect-type, ring-type e3-ubiquitin ligases, and u-box ligases. the ring-type family of e3-ubiquitin ligases constitutes a diverse group of enzymes, and in vertebrate organisms, combination of accessory domains following the ring domain leads to highly specific variants that facilitate protein-protein interactions  <cit> . an example of the functional diversity accomplished by combination of ring and other domains can be found in the large family of enzymes known as trim proteins. trim  proteins are characterized by a common core structure  and accessory domains that make this family diverse at both structural and functional levels  <cit> . trim proteins have so far been involved in processes that include cell proliferation, differentiation, development, oncogenesis and apoptosis, and some of them have also been shown to display antiviral properties .

malin is a ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase with six nhl domains   <cit>  located in its c-terminus  <cit> . nhl domains are usually involved in protein-protein interactions. malin forms a functional complex with the glucan phosphatase laforin, and this interaction is dependent on the nhl domains in malin. in this complex, laforin directs malin towards physiological substrates . thus, laforin is a targeting subunit for malin or a scaffold that brings together substrate and e <dig> ligase. mutations in the genes encoding malin  or laforin  lead to the development of lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy , and patients with mutations in either one of these genes show similar pathological presentations. malin depends on laforin interaction to perform its physiological function as an e3-ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinating substrates involved in glycogen metabolism such as glycogen synthase and pp <dig> regulatory subunit r5/ptg. while multiple groups have corroborated these findings using different systems, deletion of the malin gene in a mouse model does not result in increased accumulation of these proteins  <cit> . therefore, these incompatible results are currently under investigation.

impairment of the laforin-malin functional complex results in deregulation of glycogen metabolism and formation of insoluble glucans  <cit> . the interaction between malin and laforin is modulated by amp-activated protein kinase   <cit> , and conversely, we have recently described the ubiquitination of ampk subunits by the laforin-malin complex  <cit> . since ampk also phosphorylates r5/ptg and this phosphorylation increases the ubiquitination and further degradation of this protein by the laforin-malin complex  <cit> , there must exist a functional link between laforin, malin, ampk and r5/ptg that results in the control and regulation of glycogen synthesis.

laforin and malin belong to structurally and functionally different protein families, yet they function, in mammals, as a tightly linked functional complex. this concept gives rise to the question whether laforin and malin could have additional independent cellular functions. if these independent functions exist, it should be possible to find organisms with laforin or malin and without the second component of the complex. we recently defined the evolutionary lineage of the laforin gene  <cit> . although it was previously assumed that the gene encoding laforin  was a vertebrate-specific gene, we identified several laforin orthologs in distant organisms, including invertebrates and protists. in addition, we identified a laforin-like protein in all organisms of green algal descent. however, no data on malin or similar proteins have been reported in non-vertebrate organisms, thus, the physiological functions of malin independent of those coordinated with laforin remain unclear.

in this work, we performed a phylogenetic study of malin that indicates malin is present in all vertebrate species and a cephalochordate. importantly, this pattern of species distribution does not correlate with the species distribution of laforin, which suggests that laforin and/or malin may have additional independent functions. in addition, we found that malin shares significant identity with the e3-ubiquitin ligase trim <dig>  and it is phylogenetically related to the trim family of proteins. the commonalities between malin and trim <dig> are not reserved to just phylogenetic relationships. we demonstrate that trim <dig> can ubiquitinate malin targets in tissue culture cells, although the type of ubiquitin chain that trim <dig> incorporates into these substrates is different than malin. on the contrary, malin cannot ubiquitinate trim <dig> substrates. cumulatively, these data define the evolutionary lineage of malin, provide evidence that laforin likely possesses malin-independent functions, and uncovers structural and functional similarities between malin and trim <dig> 

RESULTS
 <dig>  malin is conserved in all classes of vertebrates
we recently defined the evolutionary lineage of the laforin gene  <cit> . the laforin gene is conserved in all vertebrate genomes, but it is absent in genomes of most non-vertebrate organisms including the standard model organisms yeast, flies, or worms. surprisingly, we found that laforin is conserved in the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae and in the cnidarian nematostella vectensis as well as in the following five protozoans cyanidioschyzon merolae, toxoplasma gondii, eimeria tenella, tetrahymena thermophila, and plasmodium tetraurelia  <cit> . thus, laforin possesses an ancient and unique evolutionary lineage. given that the function of laforin and malin has been linked in vertebrates, we sought to determine if this was true in all organisms. if they are not conserved in the same species, then these data would argue for malin- and/or laforin-independent functions.

malin is a ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase and contains six nhl domains . nhl domains form a six-bladed Î²-propeller and direct protein-protein interactions, similar to wd <dig> domains  <cit> . in order to define the evolutionary lineage of malin, we first searched vertebrate databases using the criteria that a malin ortholog must contain a ring domain and six nhl domains, in any orientation , and that it cannot contain any other domains. we utilized the ncbi non-redundant  protein database, organism-specific databases, and the superfamily database  <cit> . we performed blastp and psi-blast searches of these databases and considered any protein with an e value < 1e- <dig> a probable malin ortholog and proteins with < 1e- <dig> a possible ortholog. we analyzed each of these sequences using prosite, pfam, jpred <dig>  and cdd  <cit>  to define predicted secondary structure as well as determine if additional domains were present and excluded proteins with any additional domains.

we identified  <dig> vertebrate genomes containing a protein with a ring domain and six nhl domains . for each genome that contains a malin ortholog, we found that malin was the only protein in the genome that contained only these two domains. each malin ortholog identified had an e value < 1e- <dig>  contained a ring domain and six nhl domains with similar boundaries as human malin, and possessed similar predicted secondary structure. we searched each of the malin orthologs for additional domains, but did not identify other putative domain in the malin orthologs. to ensure that we had identified malin orthologs, we generated a mafft  <cit>  alignment of the  <dig> proteins to determine their percent identity and similarity to h. sapiens malin  as well as compared predicted secondary structure. the similarities ranged from 40% for actinopterygii  versions of malin to 100% for other primate versions of malin . of note, we identified a malin ortholog in at least one member of each class of vertebrates. thus, malin is conserved in all five classes of vertebrates, and it is the only protein in vertebrate genomes that contains only a ring and six nhl domains.

 <dig>  malin is conserved in all vertebrate genomes and one cephalochordata genome
in addition to vertebrate genomes, we also probed the ncbi databases  for a malin ortholog in invertebrate and protozoan genomes. we did not uncover a malin ortholog in any non-vertebrate genome ncbi database. given the lack of non-vertebrate sequences obtained in our blastp searches, we wondered whether the malin gene was absent in other taxa or not observed due to incomplete sequencing data.

to answer these questions, the same queries were used to perform blastp, tblastn, psi-blast, phi-blast, and domain searches against species-specific databases. we probed  <dig> species-specific databases from bilateria, cnidaria, ctenophora, placozoa, porifera, choanoflagellate, as well as single-celled protozoan genomes, and  <dig>  bacterial genomes . only sequences including similarity at both ring and nhl domains were considered as positive hits. to increase the breadth of our search, data from ensembl gene database  <cit>  were also investigated. these efforts identified a malin ortholog in one taxon outside of vertebrates. we identified a malin ortholog in the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae . although we closely examined the genomes of all metazoans, protists, plants and bacteria, we did not identify a malin ortholog in any of these other genomes. we did identify proteins with either a ring domain or nhl domains in genomes as ancient as archae . however, these proteins only contain a ring or nhl domains, and none of them contain both domains. thus, ring and nhl domains are found independently in the most basal genomes, but they are not observed within the same protein until the emergence of malin.

one of the reasons for performing these analyses was to determine if malin shared a similar evolutionary lineage with laforin. laforin is a glucan phosphatase that contains a carbohydrate binding module  and dual-specificity phosphatase  domain, and physically interacts with malin to form a functional complex. when we compared the species distribution of malin with that previously described for laforin  <cit> , we observed that laforin and malin do not correlate in species distribution . since laforin is present in the genome of more evolutionarily basal organisms than malin, these results suggest that laforin may perform additional functions independent of malin. it is possible that these functions are conserved from red algae to humans, but our results indicate that at least in lower eukaryotes laforin must posses malin-independent functions.

 <dig>  malin is phylogenetically related to the trim family of proteins
while malin is the only protein that we found in vertebrate genomes containing only a ring and six nhl domains, our bioinformatic analyses did recover other proteins with ring and nhl domains. the protein with the highest identity to malin that we recovered corresponds to trim <dig>  a e3-ubiquitin ligase that belongs to the tripartite-motif containing family of proteins  <cit> . trim <dig> is characterized by the presence of the conserved trim core domains  and also by the presence of several nhl domains, which resemble the nhl domains of malin.

given the similarity between malin and trim <dig> we decided to further investigate the phylogenetic relations between malin and trim proteins so there would be no confusion between trim and malin orthologs. sardiello et al  <cit>  recently defined the trim protein family, and classified them into group  <dig> and group  <dig> based on relatedness and their rates of evolution. malin is more similar to the  <dig> trim proteins in group  <dig>  some of which contain nhl domains. we chose four members from group  <dig> to further analyze and compare/contrast with malin. trim <dig> and trim <dig> each contain a ring, b-box, coiled-coil, and six nhl domains, and trim <dig> also contains a filamin domain . trim  <dig> and trim <dig> each contains different combinations of these five domains . first, we analyzed the ring domains of trim <dig>  trim <dig>  and trim <dig>  and found that the trim <dig> ring shares the highest degree of similarity and identity with the malin ring . in fact, when we performed a blastp search with the human malin ring domain in the ncbi h. sapiens nr database, the ring domain from trim <dig> is the first non-malin hit.

next, we performed blastp searches with human trim <dig>  trim <dig>  trim <dig>  and trim <dig>  with the aim of unveiling the phylogenetic relations between malin and this group of trim proteins. we verified orthologs of each protein by analyzing their domain boundaries and domain arrangement, and generated an alignment from the sequences of malin, trim <dig>  trim <dig>  trim <dig>  and trim <dig> from h. sapiens, p. troglodytes, r. norvegicus, and m. musculus . using the alignment, we generated a phylogenetic maximum-likelihood tree of mouse, rat, chimp and human orthologs . the tree confirms that malin and trim <dig> orthologs are the closest homologs with trim <dig>  trim <dig>  and trim <dig> orthologs as more divergent from malin.

to gain insight into the evolution of the malin and trim orthologs, we analyzed the gene structure and intron-exon boundaries of each. the gene encoding malin  is a single exon in all mammalian, bird, fish, and amphibian genomes , but the malin gene contains two exons in reptile genome . the b. floridae malin ortholog is also a single exon. the genes encoding trim <dig> and trim <dig> both contain multiple exons  in all genomes investigated, including: mammals, bird, fish, amphibian, reptiles, b. floridae, c. elegans, c. intestinalis, d. melanogaster, and n. vectensis . therefore, it seems unlikely that the malin gene is most closely related to either trim <dig> or trim <dig>  alternatively, trim <dig> and trim <dig> are both single exon genes in all mammalian genomes. we were only able to identify trim <dig> in mammalian genomes, but it is a single exon gene in all twelve genomes where we identified it. similarly, trim <dig> is a single exon gene in all fourteen mammalian genomes where it was identified, and in the two amphibian genomes. however the trim <dig> gene contains two exons in bird, fish, and reptile genomes . due to the limited sequence data available for trim <dig>  it is difficult to definitively determine if malin is more similar at the gene structural level to trim <dig> or trim <dig>  however, trim <dig> does not contain nhl repeats in its sequence while trim <dig> does contain nhl domains and malin and trim <dig> share many similarities even at the gene level. thus it seems likely that malin is more similar to trim <dig> at both the protein and gene level.

regarding species representation of trim proteins, our analyses confirm previous reports on trim family conservation  <cit> . although all trim proteins have several mammalian orthologs , there are some exceptions that are likely due to incomplete genome sequencing or gene loss: trim <dig> is absent in gallus gallus and xenopus laevis . trim <dig>  present in all mammalian genomes, is absent in monotremes, aves, amphibians and fish. trim <dig> and trim <dig> are clearly the most extended proteins from the analysed group. however, sequence divergence makes it difficult to define the correct orthology between nematostella vectensis sequences similar to trim <dig> and trim <dig>  in addition, trim <dig> is uniquely conserved in nematodes and insects. however, no significant identity with malin or any of these four trim proteins was found in protozoan  or fungal genomes . cumulatively, these data define the differences between the trim family and the ring-nhl protein malin.

 <dig>  malin and trim <dig> share sequence and structural features
given the similarities between malin and trim <dig>  we decided to further investigate these two proteins. an alignment of human trim <dig> and malin illustrates a high degree of identity at both the n-terminus  and the c-terminus  . malin and trim <dig> are 27% similar overall, and 52% and 38% similar between their ring and nhl domains, respectively. however, trim <dig> possesses a portion that spans from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  that is absent in malin. we then mapped mutations in the malin gene found in lafora disease patients onto the protein alignment . twenty-one of the thirty-seven lafora disease missense mutations in malin contained a conserved amino acid in trim <dig>  one of those conserved residues  aligns with d <dig> in trim <dig>  interestingly, this amino acid is mutated to malin-d233a in lafora disease patients  <cit>  and trim32-d487n in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients  <cit> .

to further asses these observations, we generated structural models for the nhl domains of both proteins using the crystallised nhl domain of m. tuberculosis pknd  as a template, which has an identity of  <dig> % with malin and 22% with trim <dig>  an alignment of the predicted structures  shows that both the malin and trim <dig> models contain six repeats of the characteristic three/four Î²-sheet found in nhl domains  <cit> . malin mutations analysed in figure 5a locate mainly in segments of the structure corresponding to Î²-sheets . given their location, it seems probable that deleterious mutations confer structural issues in the nhl domains and likely result in non-functional protein-protein interaction modules. it was especially interesting that residues d <dig> in malin and d <dig> in trim <dig> are located in equivalent positions not only at primary structure , but also at predicted three-dimensional structure level . the similarity of these two e <dig> ubiquitin ligases and their overall conservation for pathologically relevant amino acids prompted us to compare both proteins at a functional level.

 <dig>  malin and trim <dig> are related at functional level
in order to determine whether malin and trim <dig> could have redundant functions, we first studied a physiological substrate of malin that is related to alterations found in lafora disease. the pp <dig> regulatory subunit r5/ptg is ubiquitinated by the laforin-malin complex and labelled for degradation  <cit> . thus, we analysed whether trim <dig> was able to ubiquitinate r5/ptg. with this aim, we transfected hek <dig> cells with his-tagged ubiquitin constructs, myc-r5/ptg and pcineo-trim <dig> and purified ubiquitinated proteins by metal-affinity column purification  <cit> . r5/ptg was only ubiquitinated in cells transfected with trim <dig> . in order to analyze the specificity of the reaction, the same assay was conducted with a catalytically inactive form of trim <dig> with a h42a mutation in the ring domain . in this case no ubiquitination of r5/ptg was observed . in order to discard the possibility that the action of trim <dig> on r5/ptg was mediated by endogenous malin, we repeated the ubiquitination experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblast  cells from a mouse model lacking malin . as observed in figure 6b, the expression of trim <dig> in these cells still promoted the ubiquitination of r5/ptg. all these results provided the first functional linkage between malin and trim <dig> 

to determine the extent of this functional link, we decided to study the effect of trim <dig> on another known substrate of the laforin-malin complex, namely the amp-activated protein kinase . ampk is composed of three subunits  and we previously demonstrated the specific ubiquitination of all subunits by the laforin-malin complex  <cit> . using the same methodology described above, we observed that flag-trim <dig> produced a robust ubiquitination of both ampkÎ± and ampkÎ² subunits, but not ampkÎ³ .

in addition, we focused on the topology of ubiquitin chains produced by trim <dig> in the ampk subunits. we used different ubiquitin constructs mutated in either lys <dig>  or lys <dig> , unable to oligomerize at those residues. we recently described that the laforin-malin complex promotes the acquisition of k63-linked polyubiquitin chains onto ampk  <cit> . conversely, trim <dig> produced a different polyubiquitin chain topology since it was able to generate ubiquitination in the presence of either k48r- or k63r-ubiquitins . these results suggest a diversification in the activities of these two e3-ubiquitin ligases, despite sharing common substrates.

since trim <dig> can ubiquitinate malin substrates, we decided to investigate whether malin could ubiquitinate trim <dig> substrates. it has been described that trim <dig> ubiquitinates, among other substrates, dysbindin   <cit> , and piasy   <cit> . following a similar approach as described above but using myc-dysbindin and myc-piasy as substrates, we observed that only wild type trim <dig> but not the laforin-malin complex was able to ubiquitinate myc-dysbindin  and myc-piasy . we also tested another unrelated e3-ubiquitin ligase named mdm <dig>  an e <dig> ligase for p <dig>  but we found that it could not ubiquitinate piasy either, under these conditions . these results indicate that the functional link between malin and trim <dig> is not completely reciprocal.

discussion
malin is an e3-ubiquitin ligase mutated in lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy and interacts with the dual specificity phosphatase laforin. we sought to define the species distribution of malin in order to compare it with the species distribution observed in laforin. we utilized a bioinformatics approach and found that laforin and malin do not correlate in species distribution. laforin has a broader distribution and is conserved in all vertebrates as well as a select group of protists and invertebrates. alternatively, malin is only present in vertebrate species and the cephalochordate b. floridae, although the ubiquitin system is present in both invertebrates and protists  <cit> . in addition, these studies revealed that trim <dig>  another e3-ubiquitin ligase belonging to the tripartite-motif containing family, is closely related to malin. by means of sequence analyses, we defined the phylogenetic relationship between malin and other members of the trim family, and found that trim <dig> is the closest homolog to malin.

although the evolutionary history of large protein families is complex and difficult to asses, recent studies have established a well defined phylogeny for trim proteins  <cit> . they are divided into group  <dig> and group  <dig>  with group  <dig> being more divergent and having evolved more rapidly. our analyses found that malin is more similar to group  <dig> trim family members. comparison of malin with group  <dig> members of the trim family demonstrate that malin is most similar to trim <dig>  and they are more distantly related to trim <dig>  trim <dig>  and trim <dig>  our results concerning trim proteins correlate with the orthology groups of trim proteins previously defined by sardiello et al.  <cit> , although they did not present any data on malin. furthermore, our analyses demonstrate that trim <dig> and malin appear latter in the evolutionary time-line, since only vertebrate species show orthologs for both proteins. conversely, trim <dig> and especially trim <dig> are present in species of eukaryotic taxa evolutionarily situated closer to the probable root of the eukaryotic tree. the absence of orthologs in specific vertebrate organisms belonging to the same taxon  is probably due to incomplete sequencing of these organisms and not due to gene loss. in addition, the analyses of gene structure and intron-exon boundaries clearly indicate a close relationship between malin and trim <dig> 

despite sequence similarities, malin and trim <dig> have been characterized as e3-ubiquitin ligases involved in different diseases. both proteins display e3-ubiquitin ligase activity and share the presence of nhl domains at their tertiary structure. the physiological ubiquitination process performed by malin depends strictly on the interaction with laforin, and no oligomerization has been proved to date on malin. on the contrary, trim <dig> requires self-oligomerization in order to perform ubiquitination  <cit> . although the conserved domains shared by both proteins show a high degree of identity, the absence of the b-box and coiled-coil domains in malin constitutes an important difference that may reflect different substrate specificities. in order to assess the functional similarities of both proteins, we analysed the capability of trim <dig> to ubiquitinate laforin/malin specific substrates. a first evidence of a functional link between trim <dig> and malin was found in the ubiquitination of r5/ptg: we observed that trim <dig> is able to ubiquitinate this substrate. next, we tested the action of trim <dig> on ampk subunits, which are also substrates of the laforin-malin complex. in this case, trim <dig> ubiquitinated only the ampkÎ± and ampkÎ² subunits, whereas malin also ubiquitinates the ampkÎ³ subunit. these modifications are specific of the action of laforin/malin or trim <dig>  since we previously described that another unrelated e3-ubiquitin ligase such as mdm <dig> could not ubiquitinated any of these substrates  <cit> . analysis of the topology of the ubiquitin chains showed that ubiquitination of ampkÎ± and ampkÎ² by trim <dig> is not dependent on either lys <dig> or lys <dig> ubiquitin residues, suggesting a different topology to the one produced by malin . therefore, while there are similarities in substrate preference, there are also differences in both substrate preference and in the types of ubiquitin chains they promote. further studies are required to fully assess the functional consequences of this novel trim <dig> modification on ampk activity. we also found that laforin could be ubiquitinated by trim <dig> action . however, as we were unable to detect any physical interaction between trim <dig> and any of the malin substrates , either by yeast two-hybrid analysis or by co-immunoprecipitation methods in mammalian cells, we favour the idea that trim <dig> is a promiscuous e3-ubiquitin ligase that might be using a "hit and run" mechanism to ubiquitinate these substrates. although our data strongly suggest that trim <dig> can directly ubiquitinate malin substrates, this has not been definitively proved as we did not recapitulate the ubiquitination reaction in vitro using purified components; therefore, it might be possible that the activity that we are assigning to trim <dig> could be exerted by a trim32-dependent activation of a third e3-ligase.

trim <dig> also ubiquitinates muscular actin  <cit> , dysbindin  <cit> , and the e3-sumo ligase piasy  <cit> . trim <dig> has been related to neuronal differentiation in mice  <cit>  and its deficiency  is involved in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2h   <cit> . it has been postulated that the milder phenotype of patients having this disease may be explained by redundant functions of other e3-ubiquitin ligases performing compensatory trim <dig> functions  <cit> . since our structural models of malin and trim <dig> nhl domains show a similar three-dimensional organization, it is possible that malin or other related e3-ubiquitin ligases are capable of compensating the loss of trim <dig> and interact and/or ubiquitinate trim32-related substrates. however, no ubiquitination of the trim32-specific substrates dysbindin and piasy by malin was found in our studies. therefore, further studies will be required to fully assess the capability of malin to compensate trim <dig> loss. conversely, it has been recently described that malin deficient mice do not present differences in the levels of r5/ptg  <cit> . perhaps trim <dig> or another e3-ubiquitin ligase could compensate malin deficiency in terms of ubiquitinating this substrate. in any case, although trim <dig> and malin share some substrates, the pathological outcomes of the deficiency of trim <dig> and malin are very distinct, which indicates that some other factors affect the function of these two e3-ligases in their particular target tissues.

other mutations in the trim <dig> gene are related to the bardet-biedl syndrome type  <dig>   <cit> , whose symptoms include obesity, retinophaty, kidney and heart abnormalities and cognitive deficiency. the mutation responsible for this disease  is located in the b-box region of the protein. since this region is absent in malin, comparison of trim <dig> and malin mutants and their abilities to bind putative common interactors like e2-ubiquitin conjugating enzymes would constitute an approach to further asses the functional divergence of both proteins and their linkage to disease. in addition, the study of the e2-conjugating enzymes that coordinate ubiquitin chain elongation in malin- and trim32-regulated processes, may lead to a better understanding of the cross-talking of their ubiquitin pathways and its pathological consequences.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results show that malin is an e3-ubiquitin ligase only present in all vertebrate species and a cephalochordate. malin is related to the trim family of proteins, and they likely share a common evolutionary origin. moreover, malin shares functional features with trim <dig> in that they are both capable of ubiquitinating similar substrates. however, differences at ubiquitin chain topology promoted by each of these proteins point to divergent roles. in addition, malin shows a pattern of species distribution that does not correlate with the species distribution of laforin, which suggest that laforin and malin, in addition to forming a functional complex, may have independent functions.
