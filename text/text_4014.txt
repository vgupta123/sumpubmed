BACKGROUND
the challenge of identification and characterization of susceptibility genes for complex multifactorial diseases is partly due to the limitations of parametric statistical methods for detection of gene effects that are dependent solely or partially on interactions with other genes and with environmental exposures  <cit> . these limitations are reduced by non-parametric methods such as the combinatorial partitioning method   <cit> , which has been used to study the effect of many marker loci on quantitative phenotypes. the focus of the method is to form subsets of loci or genotypic partitions within which the trait variability is much lower than between the partitions  <cit> . the loci in such a set of genotypic partitions are then selected as candidates to influence the given trait and are then cross-validated.

a modification of this method is the multifactor dimensionality reduction  method, which has been used to study the impact of multiple loci on categorical endpoints such as presence or absence of disease or response to treatment. this is accomplished by reducing the dimensionality of the multilocus data where genotypes from multiple loci are pooled into high-risk and low-risk groups, depending on whether they are more common in affected or in unaffected individuals  <cit> . this approach is so far limited to categorical parameters and cannot be applied to quantitative traits. the only possible approach to association mapping would then be to search for patterns of genotypes at different loci. pattern recognition by machine learning techniques may then be applied to define pattern frequencies or relationships in a data set  <cit> .

in the present study we have used a variation of the combinatorial partitioning method and compared that to a pattern recognition method by the machine learning approach to identify subsets of snps that may predict the levels of metabolites in the estradiol metabolic pathway in healthy post-menopausal women. we have chosen this pathway since a positive correlation between estradiol exposure and risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women has been rather well documented  <cit> , and a significant correlation between plasma estrogen levels and subsequent risk of breast cancer development has been repeatedly described  <cit> . estrone is synthesized from cholesterol in a cascade of subsequent hydroxylations  <cit>  . after ovary seizure at menopause, the peripheral aromatization of androgens, mainly androstenedione into estrone, becomes the main source of circulating estrogen contributing to tumor stimulation  <cit> . a complex system of enzymes is responsible for estradiol synthesis and its further metabolism: cyp <dig>  cyp11a, cyp <dig>   <dig> β-hydroxysteroid hydrogenase, steroid sulfatase , sulfotransferase , cyp1a <dig>  cyp1b <dig>  catechol-o-methyltransferase . polymorphisms in these enzymes have previously been associated with both breast cancer risk and estradiol levels  <cit> . in the present report we have studied genetic polymorphism in all these enzymes and addressed the methodological challenge of the analysis of multiple loci 1) by free combinatorial approaches 2) in relation to intergenic haplotype structures within a common biochemical pathway.

RESULTS
the levels of  <dig> metabolites of the estradiol pathway were studied . high correlation was observed between the levels of the different metabolites in the plasma of healthy individuals, metabolites upstream  as well as downstream  in the pathway . weight and body mass index significantly correlated with the levels of estrone and estradiol, while levels of dhea and dhea-s inversely correlated with age. testosterone levels correlated with height .

chi square analysis
a total of  <dig> snps in  <dig> genes were genotyped in  <dig> individuals resulting in a total of  <dig> genotypes. the genotype distribution of the studied polymorphisms was significantly different between the groups of individuals with metabolic activities below and above median when chi square test was applied. the levels of e <dig> and e <dig> were significantly associated with two polymorphisms in the 3'utr of cyp <dig> as well as two non-synonymous substitutions in the cyp1b <dig> -r48g and a119s . the el level was also associated to the t461n snp in cyp1a <dig>  several other non-significant trends were observed.

combinatorial partitioning analysis )
the metabolic groups were further re-defined by using other thresholds than the median, using either one optimal threshold,  or two optimal thresholds . several moderately significant snps using the optimal thresholds approach were found . leave one out cross validation analysis was performed to find sets of genotypes that jointly predict the value of the trait . estrone levels partitioned into samples with values <  <dig>  pmol/l and > <dig>  pmol/l revealing a maximal difference in genotype distribution. a graphical representation  of the genotypes for each locus and this partition is shown in figure 2a, where each row corresponds to a snp and each column – to a sample. figure 2b shows the stack diagram. the leave one out cross validation method showed that while one snp can make only ~50% correct predictions of the estrone levels at this partition, combining  <dig> snps, including cyp1a1m <dig>  cyp1b1a119s, cyp1a1m <dig>  cyp19utr3' snps, gstp <dig>  comt allows 65% correct prediction . two of the selected polymorphisms were known to be functional at the metabolic level from previous studies in vitro. in the case of random labels, the probability of finding a set of snps that can make better prediction was found to be  <dig>  based on  <dig> simulations.

locus cyp11a <dig> was a microsatellite repeat with  <dig> variant repeat length alleles. all variant alleles were categorized together: a1/a <dig> , a1/mut, mut/mut. the qt scores and p-values for this locus and each metabolite were calculated and significant differences were found for several of the metabolites. the variant allele was more frequent in women with dhea-s level> <dig>  μg/dl than in women with dhea-s levels< <dig>  μg/dl . in the two threshold analysis the significance was even higher  when comparing individuals with dhea-s levels< <dig>  μg/dl to those with dhea-s levels> <dig>  μg/dl ; stack diagram is shown in figure 3b. for estrone the p-value was  <dig>  when comparing groups of women with estrone > <dig> pmol/l to those with estrone<  <dig> pmol/l. four women with estrone level >  <dig> pmol/l have genotypes a2/a <dig> and a4/a <dig>  similar to estrone, levels of estradiol were associated with the cyp11a variants when comparing individuals with estradiol >  <dig> pmol/l to those with estradiol <  <dig> pmol/l .

pattern recognition of snps in relation to hormone metabolizing enzymes
the optimal threshold of the metabolic levels was found by multiple testing close to the median. interactions between set of snps and physical characteristics like age and weight was identified . carriers of the wt cyp1a1m <dig> and wt gstt <dig> with age above  <dig> years and with a body weight above  <dig> kg were more often in the lower level group of the metabolite dhea-so <dig> , p-value <  <dig> ) . an interaction between the levels of this metabolite and age and weight , also seen by the conventional chi square analysis , was detected by this method. individuals with weight higher than  <dig> kg carrying the wt gstm <dig> had significantly higher plasma levels of e1s, , p <  <dig> ) .

another pattern of snps was found correlated to the estrone level; the variant allele in the 5' flanking area of cyp <dig> in combination with the wt gstt <dig> was present among  <dig> individuals with a plasma level of estrone above  <dig> pmol/l, while none of the individuals with e <dig> plasma level below  <dig> pmol/l carried this combination  p-value  <dig> ) . individuals homozygous for the variant alleles in the hsd17β , cyp1b <dig> a119s, and comt <dig> had significantly higher levels of sex hormone binding globulin,  p-value  <dig> ) . a colored infogram illustrating the significant differences in snp patterns above and below the different thresholds is given below each frequency diagram.

haplotype analysis
since some of the snps detected by the above methods reside in  <dig> different genes in vicinity on chromosome  <dig> we hypothesized that they could form common intragenic haplotypes, which in concert might account for a higher activity of the whole pathway. our findings suggest that the snps in cyp <dig>  cy <dig> and cyp1a <dig> are not inherited at random but form common haplotypes . individuals with variant number of repeats in the microsatellite repeat of cyp <dig> were also carriers of the variant alleles in both loci cyp1a1mi and m <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively) as well as in cyp19utr3' snp <dig>  . a schematic presentation of the d' values is given in figure 5c. high d' values and significant ld was observed in addition between the  <dig> snps in cyp <dig> and the  <dig> of the  <dig> snps in cyp1a <dig> carriers of the haplotype cttatatc and cgtacatc had more often e <dig> levels below median, while carriers of the tgtttatc more often had e <dig> levels above the median  . the snps in cyp1b <dig> were also in strong linkage disequilibrium forming steady haplotype blocks . while the haplotype cgg, containing the c allele in cyp1b1r48g and the g alleles in cyp1b1a119s and cyp1b <dig> v432l was associated with high levels of e <dig> and e <dig>  the haplotype gtc containing the alternative alleles in locus was associated with lower than median levels .

discussion
finding effects of groups of snps on metabolite levels is complex since the effects of individual snps are small and the number of possible snp combinations is large. we applied two different methods to help identify sets of snps correlated to metabolite levels: one using direct two-way classification based on combination of genotypes at selected loci, and another based on leave-one-out-cross-validation analysis. direct classification method requires sufficiently big sample set for meaningful evaluation of genotype combination frequencies in groups with different metabolite levels. in studies like this with a small number of samples, the loocv method allows the evaluation of larger sets of snps, since the classifiers are constructed for each locus individually. in the first "pre-screening" phase of the genotype-phenotype analysis the metabolic levels were divided by median followed by sets of percentiles of the trait values. finally, instead of pre-defining cut offs, we let the distribution of the genotypes lead us to those cut offs with a maximal difference in allele distribution. interestingly, often these best thresholds converged to the median, i.e. for estrone in both the mutual information score method as well as the pattern recognition. whether or not these resulting cut offs have some physiological significance, remains to be investigated.

long term exposure to estradiol increases the risk of breast cancer. the mechanisms responsible for this effect have not been firmly established. the prevailing theory proposes that estrogens increase the rate of cell proliferation by stimulating estrogen receptor-mediated transcription and thereby the number of errors occurring during dna replication  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis proposes that estradiol can be metabolized to quinone derivatives, which can react with dna and then remove bases from dna through a process called depurination. error prone dna repair then results in point mutations  <cit> . these two processes, increased cell proliferation and genotoxic metabolite formation, may act in an additive or synergistic fashion to induce cancer. it has been suggested that measuring total e <dig> concentration and shbg concentration may be sufficient in large epidemiological studies  <cit> . our study shows that even in a small size it is sufficient to monitor only few metabolites as we observed tight correlations between them. several genetic polymorphisms that may influence estradiol metabolism have been associated with different hormone levels. a polymorphism in cyp <dig>  a 3-bp deletion in intron  <dig> n = 7- <dig>  and a base substitution in exon  <dig>  have been reported to be associated with levels of estradiol  <cit> . genetic polymorphism in the enzymes further hydroxylating estradiol and conjugating its metabolites has also been studied. women carrying the comt met/met genotype had 28% higher 2-hydroxyestrone  and 31% higher 16α-hydroxyestrone concentrations , compared to women with the val/val genotype  <cit> .

the previous studies discussed above analyzed single loci. in a recent breast cancer case -control study, including categorical values only , a four-locus susceptibility model including the polymorphisms of comt, cyp1a1m <dig>  cyp1b <dig> codon  <dig>  and cyp1b <dig> codon  <dig> was found associated with breast cancer  <cit> . the four-locus model was significant at the p =  <dig>  level by permutation testing bringing evidence of epistasis, or gene-gene interaction in the case-control setting. each genotype at a particular locus had an influence on breast cancer disease risk dependent on the genotypes at each of the other three loci. with that in mind, we searched the hormone metabolic pathway for interactions between these loci both at random, combinatorial, without regards to the chromosomal localisation and with regards to the ld in genes that may form common haplotype structures. two such domains were identified – the polymorphisms in cyp1b <dig> form stable haplotype structures in norwegian population , and a block on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> consisting of cyp11a <dig> gene close to the cyp1a <dig>  gene and approximately  <dig>  cm telomeric to the cyp <dig> gene. indeed, we found  <dig> haplotypes in the cyp1b <dig>  which were significantly overrepresented in individuals with el and e <dig> levels above median. two of the three genotypes  were among the best predictors according to the combinatorial partitioning method as well. furthermore, the same cyp1b <dig> haplotypes  were associated with breast cancer risk . the cgg haplotype includes both the v <dig> form of cyp1b <dig> and the r <dig> with higher 4-oh/2-oh e <dig> metabolic ratio and affinity  towards 17b-estradiol respectively  <cit> . more unexpectedly, we found high d' values among snps residing in different genes but coding for proteins in the same metabolic pathway. the haplotype comprising of the t allele of cyp19utr3' snp <dig>  the variant number of repeats of cyp <dig> and the variant alleles of cyp1a1m <dig> and m <dig> we associated with high e <dig> levels . upregulation of cyp1a <dig> by dioxin derivatives through the ah receptor leads to down-regulation of cyp <dig> and er. the close location of these genes gives an attractive opportunity to study whether they are regulated by a common regulatory unit. the haplotype structures may vary from population to population – hence explain the variability of the published data on various susceptibility alleles in a number of genes.

the fact that we manage to predict correctly 65% of the individuals according to their metabolic levels based on this limited selection of snps in healthy individuals, make us believe that we have identified markers of estradiol levels in the present study. furthermore, we found similar combinations of snps as those involved in the susceptibility combinations from the case control study  <cit> . we are presently conducting a larger study of both cases and controls with a higher snp density to improve our 65% prediction value. in the last stage of the preparation of this manuscript another large study of  <dig> individuals was published  <cit>  confirming our previous initial report of an association of the polymorphism in cyp193utr and aromatase activity  <cit>  and in concordance with our present observation of association with plasma levels. here we demonstrate that the association can be discovered in much smaller number of individuals  using the multilocus data analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies provide further evidence that genetic variation may appreciably alter plasma level of sex hormone and thus have an effect on disease risk. we describe an approach for multilocus approach to study multiple low-penetrance genetic factors that together determine quantitative phenotypic traits.
