BACKGROUND
the functions of proteins rely on their interactions with various biological molecules including proteins, dnas, rnas and other small molecules. among those interactions, one of the most important ones is the protein-protein interaction. hence, the identification of protein binding site for protein-protein interaction becomes one of the basic questions in the research of protein functions. several experimental methods such as x-ray crystallography, nmr, and site-directed mutagenesis  <cit>  are well established in providing structural information on the protein-protein binding site. but the proteomics research is currently generating tremendous protein interaction data  <cit>  in want of detailed annotation by structural information. according to the current capability of experimental methods for obtaining structural information, only a limited amount of the proteomics-generated data can be processed and annotated  <cit> . therefore, the computational prediction methods such protein binding site prediction have become very important alternatives to interpret and annotate the experimentally generated proteomics data.

the computational prediction of protein binding site is particularly helpful in improving the speed and accuracy of protein docking method  <cit> . a protein docking method predicts the structure of a protein-protein complex from the structures of its monomers and can provide detailed structural information for protein-protein interactions. docking methods can be usually divided into two parts: sampling of complex conformations given the structures of the monomers and scoring of these conformations in order to find the near-native conformations. if the information of the binding site could be known in advance, the speed and accuracy of the docking method could be significantly improved, because the process of conformation sampling could be restricted to a relative small area close to the binding site. some of the recent studies  <cit>  have applied the information of predicted binding site residues to the process of docking.

the binding site prediction method is mainly based on the following hypothesis. first, the characteristics of interface and non-interface residues are significantly different. second, these differences can be quantified and utilized to design methods to discriminate and hence predict the binding sites.

the characteristics of the binding sites, namely the interface residues, have been systematically studied  <cit> . several previous works have found that the amino acid composition is different between the interface and the non-interface residues. lo conte et al.  <cit>  have analyzed the amino acid composition on different parts of protein-protein complexes using a dataset of  <dig> protein complexes. they found that the interface residues contain more aromatic and aliphatic residues than the non-interface residues. they concluded that the amino acid composition of the interface residues is more similar to that of the interior residues than to that of the non-interface residues. neuvirth et al.  <cit>  also found that some polar and aromatic residues are more abundant in the interface than outside the interface, which is similar to lo conte's conclusion. they also found that hydrophobic residues tend to clusters on the interface.

furthermore, some studies found that the interface residues are more conserved than the non-interface residues. zhou and shan  <cit>  found that the sequence conservation works well for the discrimination of interface residues from non-interface residues in their site-prediction methods. in their latest work  <cit> , they compared the conservation scores of interface and surface residues and showed that interface residues are more conserved. hu et al.  <cit>  and ma et al.  <cit>  analyzed the residue conservation in several protein families and found that the polar residues are highly conserved in the interface.

the secondary structure composition of interface residues was also studied by several researchers. jones and thornton  <cit>  found that interface residues prefer to be helix or coil rather than sheet. however, neuvirth et al.  <cit>  found that the secondary structures of interface residues prefer to be sheet or coil rather than helix. they explained the contradictory results by considering the differences in the database analyzed. so there exists a variety in the composition of secondary structures on the interface.

lo conte et al.  <cit>  and chakrabarti et al.  <cit>  analyzed the shape of the interface region and defined the interface atoms into two classes. the first class of atoms locates in the core region of the interface and the second class surrounds the first class and locates on the rim of the interface.

based on the studies on the characteristics of interface, several methods have been developed to predict and identify the interface residues from all residues on the protein surface  <cit> . various features have been used to describe the characteristics of the interface. most of them combine several properties of amino acid residues together. some of the common features that have been used are sequence conservation  <cit> , accessible surface area  <cit> , and amino acid composition  <cit> . the frequently used algorithms to identify interface residues from all surface residues are evolutionary tracing  <cit> , probability estimation  <cit> , linear parameter optimization  <cit> , neural network  <cit> , and support vector machine learning  <cit> .

neuvirth et al.  <cit>  designed promate and applied nine different properties to describe the characteristics of a surface patch. a probability estimation method was used to estimate the probability of the patch to be a part of the interface according to the values of nine properties. liang et al.  <cit>  designed pinup and the central  residue is described by the combination of side chain energy score, residue conservation score and residue interface propensity. the three properties were linearly combined into one score and the weights were obtained by a linear parameter optimization method. chen et al.  <cit>  and tjiong et al.  <cit>  designed the cons-ppisp method which used the sequence profile of the central residue and relative accessible surface area to describe the residues. a consensus neural network method was used to separate the interface residues from the non-interface residues. svm is one of the most frequently used machine learning methods applied to the prediction of interface residues  <cit> . yan et al.  <cit>  used a combination of svm and bayesian network with a sequence profile of the central residue and its sequence neighbours to make interface prediction. koike et al.  <cit>  used svm with a profile of sequence and space neighbours of the central residue. bradford et al.  <cit>  used a patch description of protein surface and the prediction of interface patches was performed by svm.

in this paper, we designed an interface residue prediction method based on svm by using the concept of core interface residue and by designing several new properties for the description of both sequentially and spatially neighbouring residues. it was found that the core interface residues were more effective in training svm models. the training and testing were performed using structures taken from a database of the complex structures from the pdb  <cit> . the prediction results of our method outperformed several other prediction methods such as promate, pinup, and cons-ppisp. the unbound proteins from the protein-protein interaction benchmark  <cit>  were also used to test our method. the results showed that our method could make reasonable prediction for the unbound structures as well.

RESULTS
statistics on the amino acid composition of the neighbour residues
the amino acid composition of the sequence and space neighbour residues of the central residues were calculated. then, the average compositions were calculated for the three residue classes respectively. the three classes are core interface, rim interface and non-interface, which are all surface exposed residues. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  .

when further observation on core residues is compared using a higher core cut-off of  <dig>  , it is seen that in addition to the similar trend for core cut-off  <dig> , g and p become more preferable to be the neighbour of the core residues than other two residue classes. it is probably due to the preference of coil state for the core interface residue. on the other hand, r becomes less preferable to be the neighbour of the core interface residues than other two residue classes. for the neighbours of rim interface, l and r become more preferable and p becomes less preferable. it is probably due to their innate secondary structure propensities as the rim interface residues have distinct preference for helix and sheet state as shown in figure  <dig>  besides p, a also becomes less preferable to be the neighbour of rim interface. it is consistent with the result  that beta carbon atoms are less preferable to be the neighbour of the rim interface. the data for the composition of rim interface indicates that the rim interface probably does not like residues with short side-chains and prefers residues with long side-chains.

when the p-value for significant differences is set as  <dig> , for both core cut-offs, all residues except g, s and t show significant difference in the average composition between the core interface and the non-interface. residues a, c, d, e, f, g, k, p, r, w, and v show significant difference in the average composition between the rim interface and the non-interface. residues a, e, f, g, i, k, m, n, and y show significant difference in the average composition between the core interface and the rim interface. for core cut-off  <dig> , residue c shows significant difference in the average composition between the core interface and the rim interface. residue t shows significant difference in the average composition between the rim interface and the non-interface. for core cut-off  <dig> , residue g shows significant difference in the average composition between the core interface and the non-interface. residues m and y shows significant difference in the average composition between the rim interface and the non-interface.

statistics on the atom composition of the neighbour residues
the atom compositions of the sequence and space neighbours of the central residues were calculated for each central residue. then, the average compositions for each atom type were calculated for the three residue classes respectively and shown in figure  <dig> . among  <dig> atom types, five show clear difference in the atom composition for both core cut-offs and only two atom types for core cut-off  <dig> .

atom types  <dig> and  <dig> are preferred to be in the neighbour of the core interface residues. these two atom types mainly contain the gamma or delta carbon atoms of the side chains of several hydrophobic and aromatic residues. this preference indicates that the core interface is generally hydrophobic. atom types  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are preferred to be in the neighbours of the non-interface residues. these three atom types mainly contain nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon atoms of several charged residues. this preference of atom types  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> indicates that the non-interface is generally polar.

for the core residues classified by the cut-off  <dig>  , atom class  <dig>  cb of all residues and most carbon atoms of pro, preferred to be in the neighbour of the core interface residues. atom type  <dig> and  <dig> preferred to be in the neighbour of non-interface residues. these two atom types contain nitrogen, oxygen, and some of the carbon atoms of several charged and polar residues. this preference of atom type  <dig> and  <dig> also indicates that the non-interface is generally polar.

statistics on the secondary structure composition of the central residues
the secondary structure compositions of the core interface, the rim interface, and the non-interface residues are shown in figure  <dig>  when the core cut-off is  <dig> , the statistics on the secondary structures  for all three classes of surface residues show a similar pattern, that is, helix and coil are more abundant than sheet. when the core cut-off is increased to  <dig> , although the rim and non-interface still have the similar pattern, a clear difference is seen for the core interface . the core interface is strongly preferred to be in the coil state. this pattern of secondary structure preference suggests that the core interface may be more flexible than the rim and non-interface regions.

statistics on the side-chain environment
the side-chain environment compositions of the core interface, the rim interface, and the non-interface residues are shown in table  <dig>  the definition of side-chain environment can be found in the method section. whether the core cut-off is  <dig>  or  <dig> , the composition of side-chain environment is biased on environment states e and p <dig>  because most of the residues in the three interface classes are surface exposed and thus belong to either e  or p  states. the majority of them are in e, a fifth of them in p <dig>  and the rest of four environment states occupy about 10%. comparing statistics of core cut-offs at  <dig>  and  <dig> , it can be seen that the core interface are more exposed as more stringent criterion is applied to define this class, that is, using a higher core cut-off. this is consistent with the above result of seeing more core interface residues in the coil state.

this table shows the composition of residues in each side-chain environment class. the first column is the value of core cut-off. the second column is the name of the three residue class. the third column to the eighth column shows the residue composition of each environment class for each residue class. the sum of the compositions of six classes does not equal to  <dig> because some of the residues cannot be classified into either of the class due to the loss of accessible surface area data. the classification method of e, p <dig>  p <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> is shown in the method section.

training of svm models for different core cut-offs
as mentioned in the method section, the residues of the  <dig> proteins  could be divided into four classes: the interior residues, the core interface residues, the rim interface residues, and the non-interface residues. the numbers of residues for each class of different core cut-offs are shown in table  <dig> 

this table shows how many residues there are in each residue class. the first column is the core cut-off for different classification. the second to the fifth columns are the number of residues for the core interface, the rim interface, the non-interface, and the interior residues respectively.

the training set for svm consisted of  <dig> random selected core interface residues and  <dig> residues which were randomly selected from the rim-interface and non-interface residues. the training set for the core cut-off of  <dig>  consists of  <dig> core interface residues and the same number of residues which were randomly selected from the rim-interface and non-interface residues.

the cva  and auc of roc curves  are both compared to illustrate the discrimination performance of different models when the core cut-off varies. the discrimination ability of the respective svm model increases as the core cut-off increases. the best model is generated when the core cut-off equals to  <dig> , the cva is  <dig> % and the auc is  <dig> . moreover, all the models that discriminate core interface residues against other residues are better than the 'normal' model that discriminate the interface residues from the non-interface residues defined by an interface contact distance of  <dig> angstrom.

'normal' stands for the model trained by interface and non-interface residues without using the definition of core interface residues. core cut-off = x  corresponds to the model trained by core interface, rim and interface residues. the second column is the 5-fold cross validation accuracy.

contribution of each descriptor from leave-one-out tests
eight residue descriptors and four central-residue specific descriptors were described in the method section. to verify their effects in the prediction of binding site, descriptor selections based on the leave-one-out test were performed . in the leave-one-out test, descriptors were removed one at a time. the values of cva were compared between the results of using all descriptors and that with the selected descriptor removed. the leave-one-out tests were performed for the training sets of core cut-offs equal to  <dig>  and  <dig> .

this table shows the results of leave-one-out test for models built when the core cut-offs equal to  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the first column is the composition of feature vectors. the second and the third columns are the cva results of core cut-off =  <dig>  and core cut-off =  <dig> , respectively. the second line shows the cva results of using all descriptors of both cut-offs. the values from the third line to the sixteenth line are the difference between the cva of each leave-one-out test and the cva using all descriptors.

the change of cva for each descriptor was shown in table  <dig>  conservation is the most important factors for both core cut-off =  <dig>  and core cut-off =  <dig> . after the removal of the conservation, the cva decreased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % for core cut-off =  <dig>  and core cut-off =  <dig>  respectively . relative accessible surface area and local environment are the second and the third most important descriptors. the decreases of cva after removing relative accessible surface area are  <dig> % and  <dig> % for core cut-off =  <dig>  and core cut-off =  <dig>  respectively. the decreases of cva for local environment are  <dig> % and  <dig> % for core cut-off =  <dig>  and core cut-off =  <dig>  respectively. the decrease of cva after removing all other descriptors vary from  <dig> %– <dig> % for core cut-off =  <dig>  and  <dig> %– <dig> % for core cut-off =  <dig> . therefore, all these descriptors show positive effects in the discrimination between the core residues and other residues.

prediction results on a test set and comparison with other methods
a test set containing  <dig> proteins  was used . feature vectors were generated for each surface residue on the proteins. the prediction was performed as mentioned in the method section. then, the sensitivity, specificity, and mcc were calculated for each protein chain. the average sensitivity, specificity, and mcc of the prediction for the test set were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> , respectively  for the model using core cut-off  <dig> . the average sensitivity, specificity, and mcc of the prediction for the test set were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> , respectively  for the model using core cut-off  <dig> . the deterioration of specificity of the model using core cut-off  <dig>  is mainly because the biased number between the core interface and other residues. therefore, we applied the model of core cut-off  <dig>  to perform the comparison tests between other methods.

this table shows the prediction results on test sets by models using different core cut-offs. the first column is the core cut-off used to make classification. the second to the fourth columns are the average sensitivity, specificity, and mcc for the  <dig> proteins in the test set respectively.

it was generally difficult to compare the results of different methods because of the different definition of interface residues and evaluation methods. we performed tests using the above test set on several different binding site prediction methods, including promate  <cit> , pinup  <cit> , and ppisp  <cit> . all predictions were performed via the internet on their web servers. data were first submitted to the servers and then analysis was performed on the prediction results received from the servers. the definition of interface and non-interface residues followed the description in the method section.

the prediction results on all the servers are shown on table  <dig>  the sensitivities for promate, pinup, and ppisp were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % respectively. the specificities for promate, pinup, and ppisp were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the mccs for promate, pinup, and ppisp were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. for comparison, we directly did the statistics on the interface residues instead of on the core interface residues in the prediction result of our method. the sensitivity, specificity, and mcc of our prediction result using the model of core cut-off =  <dig>  are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig>  respectively. from the above comparisons, it can be seen that our prediction method is generally more accurate than the other three methods.

this table shows the prediction results of different method on the test set. the first column is the method used for site prediction. the second, third, and fourth columns are average sensitivity, specificity, and mcc over all proteins in the test set. all the statistics are perform according to the classification method which classifies residues into interface and non-interface classes.

prediction test on the benchmark of unbound complexes
to further verify the prediction ability of our best svm model, prediction tests were performed on the protein-protein interaction benchmark v <dig>   <cit> . the unbound protein complexes in the benchmark have been divided into receptor and ligand already. some of the receptors and ligands were discarded because they contained more than one chains. altogether, there were  <dig> unbound proteins left  and their interaction sites were predicted. the average sensitivity, specificity, and mcc of the prediction results of the  <dig> proteins were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> , respectively using the svm with core cut-off =  <dig>  .

this table shows the prediction result on  <dig> unbound proteins of the benchmark.

discussion
in our method, we applied the concept of core interface residue to perform the prediction. the concept of core interface residue was first purposed by lo conte et al.  <cit>  and chakrabarti et al  <cit> . in their paper, atoms on the interface are divided into two parts according to the buried level after binding. their idea was adapted into our method. those most buried residues by the interface were defined as the core interface residues. we assumed that the property around the binding site area changes gradually from the core interface to the non-interface. therefore, the rim interface is an intermediate region between the core interface and the non-interface, which has the mixed characteristics of both.

the ratio of interface neighbours is designed to give a quantitative measure to evaluate whether a residue belongs to the core interface or the non-interface. if the ratio equals to  <dig>  the residue is surrounded by interface residues and is an ideal core interface residue. if the ratio equal to  <dig>  the residue has nothing to do with the interface and belong to non-interface. we can use different ratios  to study different subsets of residues on the interface. in our current work, two cut-offs were used. the core interface residues using cut-off =  <dig>  reflect the characteristics of residues on the centre of the interface. their numbers are small but they have unique properties and can be better discriminated from other residues. however, the small proportion of these residues in the whole surface residues makes the prediction specificity stay at a low level. therefore, a looser standard was used instead with the cut-off =  <dig> . this leads to relative higher prediction specificity and more applicability.

the basis of interaction binding site prediction is that there are significant differences in the characteristics between the interface and non-interface residues. sequence conservation is generally considered very important for the discrimination between the interface and non-interface residues. we also found it to be one of the most important descriptors in our method. relative accessible surface area is also used in several site prediction methods  <cit> , and proved to be effective. our results are consistent with their results. among many new descriptors that we tried in our binding site prediction, the side-chain environment is another important descriptor that is able to discriminate the core interface residues from the rim interface and non-interface residues. the significant effect of the side-chain environment is because it combines two properties, namely the solvent accessibility of the central residue and the degree of polarity in the exposed part of the side-chain, and provides the precise description of the characteristics of the centre residue.

the prediction results of the benchmark unbound complexes were worse than that of the test set of  <dig> proteins. the proteins in the benchmark are in unbound state. the proteins in the test set are in bound state. the main reason for the deterioration on the benchmark is because of the errors that come from the conformational change on the interface region of the unbound structure. an unbound training set may be a possible way to increase the general accuracy of prediction on unbound structures.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we purposed a svm-based protein-protein interaction-site prediction method using the concept of core interface residue. we tested our method on the test set and the protein-protein interaction benchmark v <dig> , and obtained reasonable prediction results for both bound and unbound structures. through the comparison of prediction results of the test set, we showed that our method outperformed three other binding-site prediction methods. therefore, our method shows adequate prediction ability and provides a basis for further development.
