BACKGROUND
members of the tgf-β super-family of secreted growth factors activate a cell surface receptor complex comprised of two distinct transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that, upon ligand binding, phosphorylate members of the downstream receptor-associated smads  . the closely related r-smads, smad <dig> and smad <dig> are phosphorylated in response to tgf-β s, activin and nodal signals. smad <dig>  smad <dig> and smad <dig> transmit bmp and gdf signals. the phosphorylated r-smads in association with the common mediator smad, smad <dig>  recruit additional cofactors to form higher order complexes that regulate target gene expression . smad <dig>  originally discovered as a tumour suppressor gene, shares overall structural features with the r-smads. however, its mh <dig> domain lacks the c-terminal sxs motif required for receptor-mediated phosphorylation. smad4-rsmad complexes control a diverse array of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and cell survival during development and adult tissue homeostasis.

in the early embryo, reciprocal signalling between the epiblast, extra-embryonic ectoderm  and the overlying visceral endoderm  is responsible for axis patterning and specification of the germ layers . members of the tgf-β/nodal and bmp subfamilies act as morphogens that control cell differentiation in a concentration dependent manner. nodal signals from the epiblast promote the formation of the distal visceral endoderm   <cit> . this specialised cell population migrates anteriorly to become the anterior visceral endoderm   <cit> . expression of the nodal antagonists lefty <dig> and cer <dig> by the ave, is essential for patterning the underlying anterior epiblast  <cit> . on the posterior side of the embryo, bmp signals from the exe together with nodal signals from the epiblast promote primitive streak formation and mesoderm induction  <cit> . continued nodal signalling during gastrulation instructs epiblast cells passing through the anterior primitive streak to become definitive endoderm, prechordal plate, node and notochord  <cit> . signalling via the bmp pathway is also crucial in early embryonic development . genetic studies demonstrate that activities of closely regulated r-smads modulate dose-dependent nodal and bmp signals in the early embryo  <cit> .

smad <dig> null embryos arrest shortly after implantation due to defects in the extra-embryonic lineages  <cit> . the mutants have a shortened proximodistal  axis, fail to acquire initial anterior-posterior  polarity, cannot gastrulate and are severely disorganised by e <dig> . early studies attributed the lethality to global proliferative defects  <cit>  but conditional rescue experiments demonstrate that tgf-β signalling pathways in the embryo proper are surprisingly smad4-independent  <cit> . thus mutant epiblasts, in response to cues from wild-type extra-embryonic tissues, are able to gastrulate and generate diverse mesodermal derivatives  <cit> , including the allantois, a rudimentary heart and mid-streak derivatives such as the somites and lateral plate mesoderm. thus, early a-p axis formation and mesodermal patterning are unaffected. however, smad <dig> is required for specification of the anterior primitive streak  derivatives including the prechordal plate, node, notochord and definitive endoderm. smad <dig> is also essential for bmp-dependent primordial germ cell  formation  <cit> .

to investigate smad <dig> requirements at early stages of embryonic development, here we exploited smad <dig> null es cells in transcriptional profiling experiments. we compared gene expression patterns in undifferentiated wild-type and mutant es cells as well as embryoid bodies . the list of up- or down-regulated genes includes several previously described tgf-β/bmp/smad targets. as expected, smad <dig> mutant ebs show a marked decrease in gastrulation markers. the mutants display increased expression of several non-canonical potency markers, germ cell markers and early endoderm markers. interestingly, smad <dig> functional loss results in increased laminin expression and decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinases . mutant ebs display thickened endoderm, an expanded basement membrane layer and exhibit defective migratory properties. collectively these results demonstrate that smad4-dependent transcriptional regulation controls development of the extra-embryonic endoderm cell lineage.

RESULTS
transcriptional profiling of smad <dig> null es cells and ebs
to identify developmentally regulated transcripts that are potentially mis-regulated in the absence of smad <dig>  we analysed es cells grown in the presence of lif, or induced to differentiate as ebs in suspension culture. we compared mrna expression patterns of wild-type and smad <dig> null es cells and day  <dig> ebs using the illumina array platform. we utilised two independent 129s9/svevh wild-type   <cit>  and smad <dig> null  es cell lines  <cit> . after  <dig> days of suspension culture the outer cells of ebs are induced to differentiate to form a layer of primitive endoderm, while a sub-population of inner cells express nascent mesodermal markers. these cell aggregates closely resemble and share many characteristics of e <dig>  embryos, the stage when growth defects become evident in smad <dig> null mutants. genes that displayed a  <dig>  fold change and a statistical significance to p <  <dig>   were considered as differentially expressed. in smad <dig> null es cells,  <dig> probe sets detected transcripts up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated, while in the ebs  <dig> and  <dig> probe sets detected increased and decreased transcript expression, respectively. representative results are summarised in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the complete list of the mis-regulated genes is available in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  data from the micro-arrays was validated using quantitative real-time pcr  and analysed using the ΔΔct method  <cit> .

micro-array and q-pcr results are presented as fold change ratios relative to normalised wild-type values. the es array results denote the average fold change of the two independent null cell lines. genes with a  <dig>  fold decrease were considered as differentially expressed. q-pcr data is displayed as the mean ± standard error of the mean  of mrna expression levels relative to hprt. genes validated by q-pcr are significantly differentially expressed , except for those indicated by an asterisk. n.d. validation not determined. a subset of differentially expressed transcripts is shown. * indicates higher than  <dig>  p value for q-pcr validation.

numerous components of the tgf-β pathway are mis-regulated in smad <dig> deficient cells including ligands , as well as known target genes  . the id family of proteins regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in response to bmp signals  <cit> . id <dig>  id <dig> and id <dig> are selectively down-regulated in cardiac neural crest cells in conditional smad <dig> mutants  <cit> . up-regulated id gene expression in response to bmp signalling is required to sustain self-renewal and pluripotency under serum-free conditions  <cit> . here, loss of smad <dig> function in es cells and ebs results in reduced expression of id <dig>  id <dig> and id <dig> family members . western blots similarly reveal that id <dig> protein levels are reduced by roughly 7-fold .

expression of msx <dig>  a bmp responsive transcription factor, previously identified as a bmp <dig> target in es cells  <cit> , is also down-regulated . the lefty proteins act as competitive inhibitors of nodal and antagonise signalling via interactions with nodal, as well as egf-cfc co-receptors such as cripto  <cit> . lefty  <dig> and lefty  <dig> expression is activated in response to nodal/activin signals  <cit> . here we observe decreased lefty <dig> and lefty <dig> expression levels due to loss of smad <dig> . collectively these results demonstrate that smad <dig> controls expression of several known tgfβ/bmp target genes and suggest that this array platform offers a promising approach to characterise smad4-dependent transcriptional networks that regulate early embryonic development.

increased steady state levels of phosphorylated receptor smads
smad <dig> deficient pancreatic carcinoma cell lines express increased levels of phosphorylated smad <dig>   <cit> . however, in contrast, p-smad <dig> levels were unaffected by smad <dig> knock down in hacat cells  <cit> . we decided to compare basal tgf-β/bmp signalling in wild-type and smad <dig> mutant es cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  wild-type  and smad <dig> null es cells  express roughly equivalent steady-state levels of smad2/ <dig>  however under normal culture conditions, in the absence of exogenous tgf-β ligands, smad <dig> mutant es cells constitutively express 2- <dig>  fold more phospho-smad <dig> in comparison with wild-type . similarly, loss of smad <dig> has no effect on steady-state levels of effectors of the bmp pathway, smad <dig> and smad <dig>  however, we observed increased levels of p-smad1/5/ <dig> r-smads . thus smad <dig> loss results in increased phosphorylation of both categories of r-smads. in contrast, phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> levels remain unchanged in the absence of smad <dig> expression .

mis-expression of non-canonical potency genes and germ cell markers
smad <dig> null e <dig>  embryos strongly express oct <dig>  <cit> . consistent with this, expression levels of the canonical core stem cell markers, oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig> are unaffected in smad <dig> mutant es cells. however, numerous early embryonic and stem cell markers, including pramel <dig>  tbx <dig> and zscan <dig>  are consistently up-regulated in smad <dig> mutant es cells . pramel <dig> is normally expressed at morula stages and is restricted to the inner cell mass of early blastocysts  <cit> . pramel <dig> over-expression promotes lif-independent self-renewal  <cit> . while transcripts are barely detectable in wt es cells  <cit> , pramel <dig> expression increased roughly 6-fold in smad <dig> mutant es cells. similarly, tbx <dig>  previously identified as a direct target of bmp smads  <cit> , is also up-regulated. tbx <dig> plays an essential role in stem cell self-renewal and enforced expression represses mesodermal cell lineage commitment  <cit> . the zinc finger protein zscan <dig> is normally expressed in late 2-cell embryos and a subpopulation of es cells  <cit> . previous experiments demonstrate zscan <dig> is essential for pre-implantation development  <cit>  and controls es cell pluripotency  <cit> . here we observed over 2-fold increased expression of zscan <dig> in both mutant es cells and ebs.

rhox5/pem, an x-linked homeodomain-containing gene, is up-regulated in mutant ebs. rhox <dig> is normally expressed in morula and early blastocyst stage embryos, but shortly after implantation expression becomes restricted to extra-embryonic lineages, specifically the ve and extra-embryonic ectoderm   <cit> . interestingly, rhox <dig> is normally expressed in es cells, but is not detected in the primitive ectoderm  <cit>  and rhox <dig> over-expression inhibits es cell differentiation  <cit> . thus, rhox <dig> function maintains early stem cell populations and promotes development of the extra-embryonic cell lineages. collectively these results demonstrate that smad4-dependent signalling regulates expression of potency genes.

germ cell specification in response to bmp/smad signals is strictly smad4-dependent. interestingly, expression of several germ cell markers was increased . e2f <dig>  which associates with polycomb group complexes, plays an important role in repressing meiosis-specific genes, including tuba3a and smc1β  <cit> . these e2f <dig> target genes are also mis-expressed in smad <dig> deficient cells. these results strengthen the idea that smad4-dependent signals regulate transcriptional networks upstream of early cell fate decisions.

smad <dig> mutant es cells display increased expression of early endoderm markers
smad <dig> loss results in increased expression of several endoderm specific markers . for example, dpp <dig> expression increased by roughly 3-fold. dpp <dig> is normally activated in the ve shortly after implantation and is undetectable in the epiblast and undifferentiated wild-type es cells  <cit> . similarly, dab <dig> is expressed in the ve and is required for surface sorting and positioning of endoderm cells  <cit> . dab <dig> expression was increased in smad <dig> mutant es cells. dab <dig> is a downstream target of gata <dig>  <cit> , a well-characterised endoderm marker  <cit> . q-pcr shows roughly an  <dig> fold-increase in gata <dig> levels in one of the smad <dig> null es cell lines . h <dig>  an imprinted gene that is normally expressed in the endodermal lineage  <cit> , as well as decorin, another endoderm marker, both show increased expression . these results suggest that signalling cues responsible for guiding early endoderm development are substantially changed in the absence of smad <dig> 

dramatically decreased expression of gastrulation stage markers
smad <dig> null embryos arrest at e <dig> , fail to acquire initial anterior-posterior polarity and lack expression of nascent mesoderm markers. previous studies described decreased expression of t  and hnf <dig>  at early stages of eb differentiation  <cit> . conditional rescue experiments demonstrate that smad <dig> is non-essential for mesoderm formation and patterning, but is required for development of the anterior primitive streak  and its derivatives  <cit> . here we detect a dramatic down-regulation of primitive streak markers in smad <dig> null ebs . besides t, we also observe down-regulated expression of the nodal targets , as well as aps markers .

smad4-dependent pathways regulate expression of extra-cellular matrix components
smad <dig> null es cells and ebs also display decreased expression of several extracellular matrix  related genes . hic- <dig>  also known as tgfβ1i <dig>  initially identified due to its tgf-β- and hydrogen peroxide-inducible expression  <cit> , is a homolog of the multi-domain protein paxillin. both hic- <dig> and paxillin localise to focal adhesion sites and interact with the focal adhesion kinase   <cit> . these membrane sub-compartments, where integrin clusters form, link the actin cytoskeleton with the ecm and are essential to mediate intracellular signalling. fak phosphorylates paxillin to provide additional docking sites for downstream adaptor molecules that collectively regulate cell migration. in nih 3t <dig> cells, hic- <dig> competes with paxillin and inhibits paxillin phosphorylation  <cit> . hic- <dig> also controls cell spreading and functions as a regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition   <cit> . here we observed decreased hic- <dig> expression  and conversely, as predicted, increased levels of phospho-paxillin in smad <dig> null es cells .

smad <dig> loss results in defective endoderm migration during eb differentiation
loss of smad <dig> leads to increased expression of the ecm component laminin alpha <dig> . ecm proteins regulate parietal endoderm differentiation and migration in eb outgrowth assays, in a fibronectin-dependent manner  <cit> . to directly test possibly impaired migratory abilities of smad <dig> mutant endodermal derivatives, ebs grown in suspension were plated on fibronectin and allowed to attach and spread. outgrowth and migration of smad <dig> deficient ebs was dramatically reduced compared to wild-type . morphometric analysis revealed that migration decreased by roughly 50% . moreover, smad <dig> mutant eb cultures grown in the absence of lif for  <dig> days contain a substantial number of compact highly adherent cells expressing oct <dig> , a well-characterised pluripotency marker  <cit> . thus, smad <dig> is required to down-regulate expression of non-canonical early potency markers/transcription factors such as zscan <dig>  rhox <dig> and tbx <dig> , while promoting the pathways responsible for endoderm formation.

smad <dig> functional loss causes defective ecm remodelling
smad <dig> mutant es cells and ebs also express decreased levels of matrix-metalloproteinases , notably mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> . mmp <dig> is a membrane-tethered enzyme, while mmp <dig> is secreted  <cit> . mmp <dig> is considered as a master mmp because it promotes activation of additional mmps  <cit> . mmp-mediated degradation of the ecm allows cells to migrate and also releases biologically active ligands, including tgf-βs, from the ecm  <cit> . reduced mmp <dig> expression has been described in smad <dig> null neural crest derived cells  <cit> , whereas, mmp <dig> was previously identified as a smad2/ <dig> target gene in hacat cells  <cit> .

the present findings that smad <dig> loss results in decreased mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> expression suggest that endodermal migration may potentially reflect an inability to breakdown and remodel the ecm. to evaluate this possibility, next we examined eb outgrowths for expression of the basement membrane components laminin and collagen iv. as shown in figure 4a, smad <dig> mutant outgrowths display a striking increase in extracellular deposition of basement membrane components. laminin and collagen iv expression is readily detectable in wild-type cells, but is strongly up-regulated in the absence of smad <dig> . laminin alpha <dig> transcripts are also up-regulated . increased production of ecm proteins, in combination with reduced levels of ecm degrading enzymes, thus results in enhanced deposition of basement membrane components and decreased migration across the fibronectin substrate. similarly, increased levels of laminin and collagen iv expression and hence an enlarged basement membrane underlying the outer layer of primitive endoderm was detected in smad <dig> mutant ebs . additionally, the outer endoderm layer was thicker and strongly positive for dab <dig> and the mutant ebs were smaller than the wt controls overall . thus the differences initially detectable in early day  <dig> ebs continued throughout the differentiation process . the excess production of laminin alpha <dig> in combination with reduced expression of the ecm degrading enzymes mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  disrupts migration and signalling by the smad <dig> mutant endoderm.

smad <dig> mutant embryos contain an excessive embryonic basement membrane
to examine whether similar changes contribute to the mutant phenotype in vivo, we analysed smad <dig> null embryos. as expected, the ve is distinctly thicker and the epiblast is significantly reduced in embryos lacking smad <dig>   <cit> . previously published h&e sections clearly show a thickened single endoderm layer  <cit> . interestingly as shown in figure 6a we observe a marked increase in collagen iv staining between the epiblast and visceral endoderm layer. as shown above, mutant endodermal cell populations display increased deposition of basement membrane that probably leads to a complete block of reciprocal signalling between the extra-embryonic endoderm and epiblast.

discussion
mis-regulated genes identified here in smad <dig> mutant es cells and those previously characterised in screens analysing smad <dig> targets in tumour cell lines show surprisingly little overlap  <cit> . besides technical issues, such as the use of different array platforms, this difference probably also reflects cell type specific gene expression patterns. we employed smad <dig> genetically null cells, whereas previous studies analysed the consequences of knock-down of smad <dig> using rnai or profiled tumour cell lines, in all likelihood carrying multiple mutations that could potentially complicate the analysis. smad <dig> is broadly expressed in embryonic and adult tissues. nonetheless, cellular responses activated by tgf-β/nodal/bmp signalling pathways are remarkably diverse. thus it seems likely that smad4-dependent targets will be influenced by cell-type specific partnerships and are highly context dependent.

previous studies demonstrate that growth characteristics of smad <dig> null es cells are indistinguishable from wild-type  <cit> . as judged by smad <dig> phosphorylation, tgf-β/nodal signalling is constitutively active in undifferentiated es cells , but its role in promoting es cell self-renewal remains unclear  <cit> . bmp signalling activates the id family of target genes and is required to sustain self-renewal and pluripotency of es cells  <cit> . smad <dig> nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is not required for r-smad phosphorylation or nuclear localisation  <cit> . r-smad dephosphorylation and nuclear export is thought to be required for optimal tgf-β signalling  <cit> . here we demonstrate that smad <dig> loss leads to increased steady state levels of both bmp and tgf-β phosphorylated r-smads . enhanced r-smad phosphorylation levels potentially reflect decreased dephosphorylation and/or nuclear export  <cit> . in the absence of smad <dig>  r-smads may be less efficiently recognised by c-terminal phosphatases and/or actively retained in the nucleus.

another possibility is that increased levels of phosphorylated r-smads may be caused by reduced expression of nodal antagonists, namely lefty <dig> and lefty <dig>  <cit> . the lack of negative feedback regulation may dramatically shift gene expression patterns. smad <dig> conditional deletion in cardiomyocytes results in increased phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  <cit>  and activation of the mapk pathway probably contributes to defective heart development. erk1/ <dig> signalling has also been implicated in controlling the transition of es cells from self-renewal to differentiation  <cit> . here, we observe loss of smad <dig> in es cells has no effect on phospho-erk1/ <dig> activity. increased r-smad phosphorylation in the absence of enhanced mapk signalling may also contribute to the changes in transcriptional profiles.

as expected smad <dig> mutant es cells and ebs display dramatically reduced levels of nascent mesoderm markers . additionally, loss of smad4-dependent signals results in increased expression of non-canonical stem cell genes, including pramel <dig>  zscan <dig> and tbx <dig>  the precise roles played by these potency genes, , remains ill defined. pramel <dig>  pramel <dig> and calcoco <dig> were initially identified as oct- <dig> related genes  <cit> . pramel <dig> is normally expressed in the compacted morula and the inner cell mass  of the early blastocyst and pramel <dig> over-expression results in lif-independent self-renewal  <cit> .

only one zscan <dig> gene has been identified in humans, while nine paralogous zscan <dig> genes are present in the mouse genome  <cit> . of these, six are known to be expressed and three of these, namely zscan4c, zscan4d and zscan4f, encode highly similar proteins  <cit> . zscan4d is an abundant transcript at the 2-cell stage but its expression is rapidly turned off. expression of zscan4c, and to a lesser extent zscan4f, is up-regulated in blastocyst outgrowths and is detectable in a mosaic fashion in es cultures  <cit> . rnai knock-down experiments demonstrate that zscan <dig> is essential for pre-implantation development  <cit> .

tbx <dig> is also required for es cell proliferation. enforced expression results in lif-independent self-renewal and is sufficient to repress mesodermal commitment  <cit> . similarly, rhox <dig> over-expression maintains es cell self-renewal in the absence of lif  <cit>  and inhibits eb differentiation  <cit> . rhox <dig> is also expressed in the primitive endoderm but its role in vivo remains unknown. interestingly, expression of the autoimmune regulator aire is also up-regulated in smad <dig> mutant cells. aire is normally expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells  and in the testis  <cit> . aire expression by mtecs induces expression of nanog, oct <dig>  and sox <dig>  and is required for promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted antigens  <cit> . these activities are required for imposing central tolerance and controlling autoimmunity. increased aire expression may similarly contribute to promiscuous gene expression patterns described here in smad <dig> mutant es cells.

smad <dig> mutant es cells also up-regulate expression of dab <dig>  rhox <dig> and hnf4a, which are normally expressed in the early primitive endoderm  <cit> . the relatively immature smad <dig> mutant endoderm cells may fail to progress towards a more differentiated ve state. consistent with this idea, the endoderm formed by mutant ebs displays a distinctive more rounded thicker morphology, similar to that present in mutant embryos. additionally, marker genes normally present in mature ve such as fgf <dig>  foxa <dig>  cer <dig>  gsc and lhx <dig> are markedly down-regulated. another possibility is that these genes are under-represented due to the block in a-p patterning and/or the failure to induce mesodermal and definitive endoderm cell lineages. these observations reinforce the idea that smad4-dependent signals are essential in the early primitive endoderm to promote reciprocal signalling and pattern the underlying epiblast.

during mouse embryogenesis, the primitive endoderm generates a layer of bm between the ve and the epiblast , while the highly secretory parietal endoderm  cell population, in conjunction with the trophectoderm, is responsible for producing reichert's membrane, the protective layer between the embryo and the maternal uterine environment. the bm overlying the embryo polarises the epiblast and stimulates cavitation  <cit> . numerous mutations that disrupt basement membrane synthesis cause early post-implantation lethality  <cit> . mmps play important roles in ecm remodelling, however their functional contributions to early embryonic development remains ill defined. it has been proposed that mmps synthesised by the trophectoderm promote implantation of the embryo into the uterine wall  <cit> . mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> are known to be expressed by icm outgrowths and cultured pe-like cells  <cit> . however, none of the mmp loss of function mutations generated to-date disrupt early development. in all likelihood the failure to observe embryonic phenotypes simply reflects the extensive overlapping expression patterns and functional redundancy among close family members  <cit> .

numerous ecm-related genes, including pai- <dig>  fibronectin and pro-collagens, are controlled by smad4-independent signals  <cit> . the present experiments demonstrate for the first time that remodelling ecm components in the early embryo requires smad4-dependent signals . besides breaking down the ecm, mmps can also release cell surface associated growth factors from the ecm. in particular, mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> release biologically active tgf-β  <cit> . cd <dig> and tgf-β are known mmp substrates  <cit>  and intriguingly both cd <dig> and tgf-β <dig> are mis-regulated in smad <dig> mutant es cells.

reduced mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> expression in combination with up-regulated laminin production, leads to excessive bm deposition and results in endoderm migration defects in eb outgrowth assays. interestingly, previous studies demonstrate that endodermal derivatives of es cells, with a constitutively active akt/pkb pathway, similarly produce excess bm underlying the endoderm layer, due to a massive increase in laminin- <dig> and collagen iv synthesis  <cit> . we speculate that cross-talk between tgf-β and akt/pkb signalling pathways may cooperatively regulate expression and remodelling of ecm components in the early embryo.

the present results demonstrate that smad <dig> mutant endodermal derivatives display defective migration in eb outgrowth assays. similarly, smad <dig> regulates tgf-β induced cell migration in keratinocytes and pancreatic tumour cells  <cit> . the epithelial-mesenchymal transitions essential in the early embryo and those associated with tumour progression exhibit striking similarities. surprisingly little is known about tgf-β/smad signals required for guiding endodermal cell migration at early stages of development. smad <dig> null blastocysts display defective outgrowth  <cit>  but cell migration and proliferative capabilities are tightly coupled, making it difficult to distinguish whether smad <dig> loss results in migration defects per se or can be explained due to decreased cell proliferation. results of the eb outgrowth assays presented here clearly demonstrate that smad <dig> regulates endoderm migratory capabilities in vitro. however, formation of the parietal endoderm is not impaired in smad <dig> mutant embryos. thus synthesis of reichert's membrane forms normally despite the small size of the embryo  <cit> . rather, loss of smad function selectively disrupts ve development, probably due to impaired reciprocal signalling between the ve and the epiblast. nodal signalling from the epiblast induces the ave in the overlying endoderm via a smad <dig> dependent pathway  <cit> . in turn, activation of key targets in the ave including foxa <dig>  lhx <dig>  cer <dig> and lefty <dig> provide important signalling cues for patterning the epiblast . the present experiments demonstrate that smad <dig> mutant ebs show reduced expression of cer <dig>  a negative regulator of tgf-β/bmp signalling, as well as foxa <dig> and lhx <dig> . excess basement membrane produced by smad <dig> mutant endoderm likely acts as a reservoir trap for biologically active ligands and causes defective cell-cell communication between the epiblast, visceral endoderm and extra-embryonic ectoderm.

CONCLUSIONS
our transcriptional profiling experiments have identified numerous genes that are differentially expressed in smad <dig> mutant es cells and ebs. analysis of the gene list provides new insights into the tissue defects in smad <dig> mutant embryos. the failure to down-regulate the non-canonical potency markers causes defective endodermal cell lineage commitment. developmental arrest is associated with excess basement membrane, resulting from increased production of the ecm components and decreased expression of mmps required for remodelling . the thickened bm disrupts reciprocal signalling between the ve and epiblast. hence, deregulated expression of smad <dig> target genes in the primitive endoderm results in the inability to form mesoderm and definitive endoderm.
