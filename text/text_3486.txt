BACKGROUND
dynamic biological systems, such as cells, are inherently complex. this complexity arises from the selective and nonlinear interconnections of functionally diverse system components to produce coherent behavior. the key challenge is to reveal underlying simplicity from complexity
 <cit> . unlike the four maxwell’s equations describing all the electro-magnetic phenomena from “first principles,” the fundamental rules that quantify the low dimensional behavior of biological systems are yet to be discovered.

complementing approaches based on first principles, where the underlying system model is described by a system of equations, the data-driven modeling of system behavior is a promising approach. it aims to interrelate data from disparate and noisy experiments and observations to find informative features and link them to formulate fundamental principles governing a complex behavior. this process frequently begins with a comprehensive enumeration of the system “components”  derived from experimental data. discovery of putative associations between these “components” can then be used to design in silico system models  to better understand real system behavior.

to somewhat simplify this intricate process, data-driven characterization of a complex system behavior often starts with defining a target set of system’s distinct phenotypes of interest, such as thermo-resistance, acid-tolerance, hydrogen production, and enumerating only those key system components that could be responsible for or contributing to the given phenotype. for example, if the target phenotype is ethanol production by microbial cells via biomass degradation, then enumeration of phenotype-related system components would identify all the groups of proteins involved in degradation of cellulose to sugars, transport of these sugars through the membrane, and their fermentation to ethanol. similarly, enumeration of all the cancer-related cellular components would identify all the genes that are likely related to the expression of cancerous cellular phenotype.

the difficulty in enumerating all the phenotype-related system components lies in dealing with the enormous number of system components  that could easily reach thousands or even hundreds of thousands. such enormous feature space could easily lead to the problem, coined by bellman as “the curse of dimensionality”
 <cit> . the problem gets complicated if one needs to select all those features that would provide clear differentiation between the true and merely feasible associations with the target phenotype. in addition, hierarchical nature of most biological systems leads to “short- and long-range” interactions between the features, or system. for example, hydrophobic residue pairs could enhance a propensity for other adjacent hydrophobic pairs . on the other hand, highly specific residue interactions may be under selective pressure to fit into an overarching architectural motif , thus contributing to “long-range” feature dependencies.

moreover, it is often the case that a coordinated, not independent, action of several system components determines what phenotype a given system will likely express. a system response represents a complex process, involving a series of  interacting events. such non-linear cooperative or competing interactions between the system components often form hierarchical functional modules  that act not only on different spatial and temporal scales but also in response to fluctuations induced by endogenous and exogenous factors. hence, the approaches that identify individual components that confer a given system phenotype are likely not optimized to detect groups of such interplays between system components. instead, there is a need for methods that aim to enumerate all the groups of cross-talking system components that could be associated with the system phenotypic state. we call this problem the enumeration of system phenotype-determining component interplays.

to address this problem, we propose an iterative, classification-driven approach that comprehensively enumerates the set of feature subsets that discriminate between different system phenotypes . we define a system component  as a feature in this paper. given a set of observations about system components  with the corresponding assignment of the system’s phenotype , our method measures the importance of feature subsets to discriminate between system phenotypes. despite combinatorial complexity of the problem, our method almost exhaustively explores feature subsets based on information-theoretic selection and dense enriched subgraph enumeration process. our method rests on a hypothesis that if a subset of system components discriminates between system’s functional states, then when considered altogether, these components most likely form a cross-talking phenotype-determining feature subset. it also places the contribution of an entire feature subset at the core of the analysis as opposed to the approaches that first evaluate the importance of individual features and then filters those that are associated with a particular system’s phenotype. it further filters those feature subsets that are statistically significant, and are thus assumed to be relevant to the target phenotype. our method can be applied to both instance-based data such as microarray patient sample data and network-based data such as gene networks.

the major contributions of this work are as follows: 

 <dig>  we propose an algorithm, named spice, to address the new problem of enumeration of system phenotype-determining component interplays. spice iteratively enumerates all the groups of statistically significant cross-talking system components, which, to the best of our knowledge, no existing methodologies are particularly designed for.

 <dig>  we evaluate our method on both instance-based data and network-based data to identify system components related to three target phenotypes: biohydrogen production, motility, and cancer. we show that the identified phenotype-related components are biologically relevant and consistent with the results in literature.

 <dig>  additionally, we apply our method to eight benchmark microarray data sets to show its effectiveness and robustness on the phenotype-classification task.

related work
to the best of our knowledge, the proposed problem of enumerating statistically significant component interplays that are key contributors to the system’s phenotype has not been addressed in literature. the problem resembles, yet with quite apparent distinctions, the problems of feature selection, phylogenetic profiling, network alignment, and frequent subgraph mining.

at a higher level, these problems could be divided into two major categories depending on whether pairwise relationships between system components are known. if they are defined, then the system could be modeled as a complex network, and multiple network alignment approaches
 <cit>  that look for subgraphs that co-occur across multiple network instances for the same system’s phenotype are putative candidates for the target component interplays. the key limitation of this strategy is that such approaches aim to identify the component groups that are present in all or most of a given set of network instances and would likely miss those that are only common to a subset of the instances. likewise, they are not equipped with any means to suggest that these groups are specific to the target system phenotype and not common to multiple system phenotypes. while the former limitation is addressed by the approaches based on frequent subgraph mining
 <cit> , similar comments would still hold for the latter comment. in addition, the runtime for these approaches grows exponentially; even the most efficient ones, such as mule
 <cit>  that enumerates maximal frequent edge sets, took almost  <dig> days for a set of  <dig> network instances . while efficient heuristics have been reported
 <cit> , they are tailored for specific network types .

for the second category, the system is often represented by its set of components  that are defined over multiple instances  for each of the finite set of system’s distinct phenotypes. in this case, univariate approaches, such as those that, for the given feature, look for a strong correlation between its profile and the system’s phenotype profile across multiple instances identify a set of putative candidates for component interplays. different correlation measures, such as pearson correlation, mutual information, student’s t-test, anova, wilcoxon rank sum, rank products, and other univariate filter feature selection techniques can provide different candidate sets that could be further assessed with set-theoretical approaches to provide either higher specificity  or higher sensitivity .

a particular instance of such a strategy is phylogenetic profiling
 <cit> , where different organisms that exhibit various  phenotypes  are considered as observations characterized by the the presence or absence of particular genes . the underlying hypothesis behind this approach is that candidate genes are more likely to be present in phenotype-expressing organisms than in phenotype-non-expressing organisms due to an evolutionary pressure to conserve the phenotype-related genes
 <cit> . while simple, fast, and effective
 <cit>  in finding individual components that are likely associated with the system’s phenotype, such methods are quite limited in discovering of the component interplays.

multivariate feature selection approaches could be considered as the closest approximation to the proposed problem. the multivariate feature selection approaches can be broadly divided into the following categories:  filter techniques ,  wrapper techniques  and the k-nearest neighbor  method)
 <cit> ), and  embedded techniques . in filter techniques, the relevance of features is evaluated according to some metric, and the features with the top k ranking are then selected for further analysis. filter feature selection techniques are simple, fast, and effective, but these techniques often ignore the correlations between different features. in biology, these correlations depict protein interactions and should not be ignored. wrapper methods take the dependencies between the features into account, but suffer from overfitting problem. additionally, they are often computationally expensive. embedded methods can be far less computationally expensive than wrapper methods, but these approaches are very specific to a given classification algorithm.

our work is also related to network-based identification methods. network-based identification methods aim to incorporate pathway or gene network information  information to help identify functional modules, or improve the prediction. pathway-based methods
 <cit>  try to detect the network pathways by assuming that the genes inside a module are co-expressed. however, pathway-based methods ignore the detailed network topology, and a small perturbation that is likely to affect many “modules”
 <cit> . while integrating of gene expression information into identification of gene modules is biologically meaningful, gene-network based methods are rarely satisfactory because they either focus on small networks by using the greedy subgraph search algorithm
 <cit>  or focus on detecting non-overlapping subnetworks
 <cit> .

RESULTS
the nature of the proposed methodology, system phenotype-related interplaying components enumerator  , suggests that detected component interplays   could play an important role in defining the specificity of the system’s phenotype;  would likely exhibit stronger inter-component relationships within the same group than between the groups and are functionally coherent, likely, act in a coordinated manner to perform the phenotype-specific function; and  collectively, could improve the predictive skill of the system’s phenotypes .

phenotype-specificity determining components
groups of enzymes associated with biohydrogen production
biological hydrogen is a promising renewable energy source
 <cit> , which can be generated by utilizing one of three metabolic processes: light fermentation, dark fermentation, or photosynthesis
 <cit> . to date, a number of phylogenetically diverse microorganisms have been identified as hydrogen producing. such organisms include photosynthetic bacteria, nitrogen-fixers, and heterotrophic microorganisms
 <cit> . in order to generate hydrogen, these organisms may rely upon one or more metabolic routes. as such, the biohydrogen production phenotype provides an opportunity to evaluate the capabilities of spice to handle a relatively complex phenotype. identification of phenotype-related components was based on the assumption that if a component  is specific to biohydrogen production, then it is likely evolutionarily conserved across h2-producing organisms, and it is absent in most h2-non-producing ones.

our first experiment includes the data about  <dig> h2-producing and  <dig> h2-non-producing microorganisms  and compares spice’s performance against the two commonly used statistical methods: mutual information  and student’s t-test, and one multivariate feature selection approach: svm recursive feature elimination . among  <dig> h2-producing microorganisms, four microorganisms utilize bio-photolysis, five microorganisms utilize light fermentation, and eight microorganisms utilize dark fermentation.  <dig> microorganisms are listed as non-hydrogen producing because they are not associated with hydrogen production based on literature review, or they lack hydrogenase
 <cit> , one of the key enzymes involved in hydrogen production. all microorganisms used in this experiment were verified as completely sequenced using the ncbi database. the input to spice is a matrix, with the enzyme ec numbers along the rows,  <dig> organisms  along the columns, and the entry in each cell  is the copy number for enzyme i in organism j. the last row of the matrix includes information about the organism’s ability to express the hydrogen production phenotype.

the mutual information method
 <cit>  assesses correlation between the enzyme’s phylogenetic profile and the organism’s h2-production profile across multiple organisms. in addition, it reports a significance threshold by shuffling the enzyme profile vectors and calculating the mutual information with the organism’s phenotype profile. only those enzymes, whose mutual information values lie above the confidence cutoff are reported.

the student’s t-test is another statistical method to identify phenotype related enzymes, where we utilize the enzyme phylogenetic profiles alone to measures statistical bias of enzyme copy numbers in one phenotypic group of organisms vs. the other. the test results are filtered so that only enzymes with the p-value less than  <dig>  are considered significant.

guyon et al. <cit>  proposed the svm-rfe algorithm to rank the features  based on the value of the decision hyperplane given by the svm. the features with small ranking scores are removed. the top  <dig> enzymes  are considered significant.

figure
 <dig> and figure
 <dig> show the pathway and key enzymes for hydrogen production from the fermentation of glucose to acetate  and butyrate  in clostridium acetobutylicum. within this process, glucose is broken down through a series of glycolytic enzymes to generate pyruvate. pyruvate is then converted to acetyl-coa through the action of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase. during this step, hydrogen gas is produced when pyruvate is oxidized, thus resulting in the formation of co <dig> plus h <dig>  production of hydrogen via this route is mediated through two enzymes—pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydrogenase. acetyl-coa generated produced from pyruvate can then enter a number of pathways, including the acetate and butyrate formation pathways.

while production of hydrogen occurs predominately during formation of acetyl-coa and not in the secondary pathway , acetate and butyrate fermentation pathways play an important role in the overall yield of hydrogen by microorganisms. in metabolic engineering studies, the goal is to generate the highest theoretical yield of hydrogen through alteration of metabolic routes or key enzymes related to hydrogen production.

for enhanced hydrogen production, acetate is the desired end product because of its higher hydrogen yield compared to other by-products, such as butyrate
 <cit> . specific differences in conversion efficiencies can be observed by comparing the two chemical reactions below: 

  c6h12o6+2h2o→2ch3cooh+2co2+4h2:glucose into acetate 

  c6h12o6→ch3ch2ch2cooh+2co2+2h2:glucose into butyrate 

the first reaction shows that the maximum theoretical hydrogen yield is  <dig> h <dig> per mol of glucose produced when acetate is the end product
 <cit> , compared to a maximum theoretical hydrogen yield of  <dig> h <dig> with butyrate as the end product
 <cit> . during acetate and butyrate formation,  <dig> mols of hydrogen are generated during reaction  <dig> when pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase reduces ferredoxin  and hydrogenase immediately oxidizes it to generate h <dig> . when acetate is the only end product as depicted in figure
 <dig>  then additional hydrogen is produced when 2nad+ is reduced to form 2nadh + 2h+ . an illustration of the two reactions is shown in figure
 <dig>  and figure
 <dig> .

due to the importance of acetate and butyrate production in the generation of hydrogen production, we evaluated the ability of spice to identify these two pathways. results show that spice identified all of the acetate pathway’s constituent enzymes, including acetate kinase , as being significant. in contrast, the student’s t-test and the mi method did not find any of the enzymes, and svm-rfe detected acetate kinase. additionally, all five enzymes active in the butyrate pathway
 <cit>  were found by the spice method. among these, only three were discovered by the svm-rfe, two were found by the student’s t-test and none by the mi method.

within facultative anaerobes like escherichia coli, hydrogen gas may be produced directly through the production of formate. in this pathway, pyruvate is converted to formate and acetyl-coa with the use of pyruvate formate lyase 
 <cit> . the formate hydrogen lyase complex made up of formate dehydrogenase and ferredoxin hydrogenase breaks down the formate into hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide
 <cit> . in this study, pyruvate formate lyase was found by the spice method to be significant.

table
 <dig> shows that spice detected all the enzymes  specific to the three pathways in facultative anaerobes, such as escherichia coli, while mutual information could not even discover a single enzyme, student’s t-test could only detect  <dig> enzymes, and svm-rfe could find four out of  <dig> enzymes. thus, spice outperformed, in terms of sensitivity, the existing state-of-the-art methods based on student’s t-test, mi, and svm-rfe. the enzymes identified by spice are next described in the context of their corresponding metabolic pathways.

cog modules corresponding to biohydrogen production
to expand our study beyond metabolic subsystems to include possible regulators, transporters, and others, in our next experiment, we replace enzymes in the matrix with the clusters of orthologous groups 
 <cit> . we obtain cog–organism association information from the string database. the new cog-centric matrix for this experiment can be found in additional file
 <dig> 

the set of enumerated cog modules with the statistically significant p-value of  <dig>  is provided in additional file
 <dig>  spice was able to identify cog modules that are known to be associated with hydrogen production based on our literature review and prior knowledge. next, we will briefly summarize some of these modules.

cog modules related to nitrogenase
in addition to the metabolic pathways described above, other key enzymes are known to be associated with hydrogen production in a number of microorganisms
 <cit> . examples of such enzymes include nitrogenase and hydrogenase enzyme complexes. hydrogen producing organisms capable of fixing nitrogen contain enzyme complexes, termed nitrogenases. within nitrogenase complexes, nitrogen gas is converted to ammonia, inadvertently resulting in the production of hydrogen gas as a byproduct
 <cit> .

evaluation of the cog modules generated by spice indicated the presence of two modules, each containing an essential component of enzyme complex nitrogenase. in the first module, two cogs  were identified. cog <dig> is associated with expression of the molybdenum–iron protein 
 <cit>  and cog <dig> is associated with the protein—ribose 5-phosphate isomerase . nifd protein is one essential component of nitrogenase, serving as the binding site for substrates during nitrogen-fixation
 <cit> . rpia takes a vital part in carbohydrate anabolism and catabolism through its participation in the pentose phosphate pathway  and calvin cycle
 <cit> . in addition, studies of central metabolism indicate that rpia is a protein highly conserved across many microorganisms
 <cit> . however, in this study, rpia was paired with nifd, suggesting that both proteins may be associated with nitrogen-fixation, hence biological hydrogen production. in terms of hydrogen production, metabolism of and the ability to metabolize specific carbohydrates play an indirect role in the over-production of hydrogen. one example is the c. butyricum. metabolic studies of the c. butyricum demonstrate the ability of this bacterium to digest a variety of carbohydrates and to produce hydrogen via degradation of carbohydrates
 <cit> .

another role rpia may play is the production of nadph required for fixing nitrogen
 <cit> . in nitrogen fixers, the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle has been reported as active. during oxidative ppp, riboluse-5-phosphate is converted to ribose-5-phosphate by rpi. during this reaction, nadph is generated, thus allowing for n assimilation, n-fixation, and production of hydrogen.

the second nitrogenase-related module identified by spice contains cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . similar to nifd, nifh is also considered to be an essential component of nitrogenase. it is responsible for assisting with the biosynthesis of co-factors for nifd
 <cit> . cog <dig> is uncharacterized. while we cannot predict the role of the protein from this module, its presence suggests that it is either associated with the nitrogen fixation or hydrogen production phenotype.

cog modules corresponding to hydrogenase
hydrogenase enzyme complexes are key enzymes involved in the uptake and production of biological hydrogen
 <cit> . analysis of hydrogenase enzymes have identified three different types, each associated with a number of accessory proteins necessary for activation
 <cit> . these include the -hydrogenase, -hydrogenase, and non-metal containing hydrogenase enzyme
 <cit> . due to the importance of hydrogenase in both hydrogen production and hydrogen uptake, several studies have examined the role of hydrogenase enzymes in a number of different hydrogen-producing organisms
 <cit> . these studies have found many microorganisms, including clostridium acetobutylicum, capable of having both hydrogen uptake  and hydrogen evolving enzymes . in this study, spice predicted the presence of both hydrogen uptake and hydrogen evolving enzymes as related to the hydrogen production phenotype. categorization of hydrogen uptake hydrogenases may be due to the absence of hydrogenase in microorganisms present in our data set.

in this study, spice identified one module containing a hydrogen evolving hydrogenase. within this module two cogs, cog <dig>  and cog <dig>  were present. the protein id for cog <dig> was not identified in the literature review; however, -hydrogenases are responsible for producing hydrogen
 <cit> . nucleotidyltransferases are proteins involved in a number of biological processes ranging from dna repair to transcription
 <cit> . since these proteins are generally involved in dna and rna-related processes, it is unclear why a predicted nucleotidyltransferase was paired with hydrogenase. to understand the interaction between these two proteins, experimental molecular analysis is necessary.

another cog module found by spice contains cog <dig> and cog <dig>  which are associated with expression of two hydrogenase uptake proteins—hydrogenase maturation factor  and nhap-type na+/h+ and k+/h+ antiporters . hypf has been found as a carbamoyl phosphate converting enzyme  involved in the synthesis of active –hydrogenases in escherichia coli and other bacteria
 <cit> . nt01cx_ <dig>  an orthologous group of cog <dig>  is associated with expression of sodium/hydrogen exchanger protein . nhe <dig> has been found to play an important role in hydrogen production of acidaminococcus fermentans, escherichia coli and bacterial communities within a dark fermentation fluidised-bed bioreactor
 <cit> .

spice also identified three other types of hydrogenase maturation proteins—hypc, hypd, and hype. cogs corresponding to these proteins are cog <dig> , cog <dig> , and cog <dig> . understanding complexes, such as uptake hydrogenase enzymes, is important for deciphering regulatory mechanisms and activity of these key enzymes. for example, in studies evaluating accessory proteins present in -hydrogenase complexes, hypcdef proteins are described as regulators for maturation of uptake hydrogenase through participation in development of the active center
 <cit> . if one of the hyp proteins is missing, the entire complex is inactivated.

in h2–producing microorganisms such as escherichia coli, hydrogenase maturation proteins act as regulators for maturation of uptake hydrogenase in development of the active center
 <cit> . regulation is conducted by inserting fe, ni, and diatomic ligands of hypa–f proteins into the hydrogenase center for activation and maturation
 <cit> . to carry out this process, hype and hypf are in charge of synthesis and insertion of fe cyanide ligands into the hydrogenase’s metal center, and hypc and hypd are responsible for construction of the cyanide ligands
 <cit> .

in addition, spice identified two hydrogenase proteins associated with anaerobiosis
 <cit> . they are cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . unlike the hyp proteins, which are accessory proteins involved in the assembly of the metallocenters, hya proteins are responsible for the maturation of hydrogenase-1
 <cit> .

other cog modules related to biohydrogen
other biohydrogen production-related cogs, such as cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig> and others, shown under the hydrogenase category in string database are detected as part of other modules by spice. as mentioned earlier, hydrogenase is one of the key proteins  involved in hydrogen production and uptake
 <cit> . the complete list of all the identified putative biohydrogen-related cog modules is available in additional file
 <dig> 

motility-related cog modules
for a large-scale experiment, we set up another experiment on a different phenotype—motility. a total of  <dig> organisms including  <dig> non-motile organisms and  <dig> motile organisms were chosen from slonim et al. <cit> . for p-value of less than  <dig> , spice detected  <dig> modules. the input data and results can be found in additional files
 <dig> and
 <dig>  respectively.

one of the motility phenotype-related cog modules contained cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  and cog <dig>  among the four cogs, cog <dig>  whose function is associate with the expression of flagellar biosynthetic protein , has a high correlation with flagellar assembly pathway
 <cit> . flagellar assembly pathway, which enables the movement of microorganisms, is well-known to be important for bacterial motility
 <cit> . proteins associated with the other three cogs include uncharacterized serine protease  and two hypothetical proteins. yyxa in a motile organism, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, has a similar phylogenetic profile to chemotaxis-related proteins
 <cit> . chemotaxis pathway, which is also important for bacterial motility, determines how the microorganism moves according to its environment
 <cit> . chemotaxis pathway and flagellar assembly pathway function together to guide bacteria’s direction of movement
 <cit> . the phylogenetic profile of the other two hypothetical proteins  are shown to be correlated with the pattern of motility across many bacterial genomes
 <cit> .

additionally, spice enumerated other cog modules that contained other known flagellar-related cogs like cog <dig>  cog <dig>  and cog <dig> and other known chemotaxis-related cogs such as cog <dig>  cog <dig>  and cog <dig>  supported by literature
 <cit> . besides flagellar-related and chemotaxis-related cogs, type iii secretion system-related cogs, such as cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  and cog <dig>  were also found in some of our enumerated modules. the type iii secretion system is found to be highly correlated with bacterial motility, because some of its protein structure is very similar in structure, function, and gene sequence to the flagellar assembly system
 <cit> .

cancer-related genes
identifying all the genes that could discriminate tumor cells from normal cells in microarray gene expression data is non-trivial
 <cit> . again, the task is not to find a single “best”-discriminating gene set, but enumerate as many cancer-related genes and groups of genes as possible provided they are associated with cancer expression phenotype; this task is becoming particularly important in the context of personalized medicine.

leukemia cancer data was selected to show the effectiveness of our method to detect phenotype-related gene modules in biological networks. leukemia data can be downloaded from broad institute cancer program data . it contains  <dig> measurements for the expression of  <dig>  genes, corresponding to the samples taken from bone marrow and peripheral blood. out of these samples,  <dig> samples are classified as all , and  <dig> samples are classified as aml .

the first  <dig> genes identified by spice were used as seed set, and a total of  <dig> phenotype-associated gene functional modules  were generated by dense algorithm in the leukemia network.  <dig> out of the  <dig> seed genes are filtered out by our method. table
 <dig> shows the first  <dig> models identified by our algorithm. specifically, gene kiaa <dig> found by our model  <dig> is highly correlated with anti-cancer agents
 <cit> . kiaa <dig> encodes tomm20—a mitochondrial import receptor
 <cit> . tomm <dig> has been shown to interact with a central anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig>  gene
 <cit> . the expression of bcl- <dig> has been used as a prognostic marker for acute myeloid leukemia
 <cit> . kiaa <dig>  cellular nucleic acid binding protein and kiaa <dig> belonged to a functional module in the leukemia network. our method also detected an overlapping functional module with only one gene  difference to model  <dig>  zyxin found by our model  <dig> plays a vital role in mitosis
 <cit> , and the lim domain of zyxin is known to interact with leukemogenic bhlh proteins, such as tal <dig>  tal <dig>  and lyl1
 <cit> .

note: more cancer-related genes are found by other models.

predictive skill
data
eight publicly available multi-phenotype-genotype datasets are used in this study. table
 <dig> summarizes some characteristics of these datasets, their sources, and the best-to-date performance reported in literature. for comparison purposes, the last column indicates spice’s performance.

notes: *: discretized data; cv: cross-validation; rp: random partition; r: accuracy from source reference; ♭: accuracy reported in a recent literature.

evaluation methodology
for two-class, 10-fold cross-validation are employed. 10-fold cross validation has been proved by witten and frank
 <cit>  to be a good way to evaluate the performance of a classifier. in 10-fold cross-validation, the original data is partitioned into  <dig> different subsets. each of the  <dig> subsets is used as the test set, and nine other subsets are used as training set. for multi-class datasets, 3-fold cross validation is used to ensure that each subset can have all different classes of samples.

bootstrapping validation, via commonly used bootstrap estimators, e <dig> bootstrap and . <dig> bootstrap
 <cit> , is also applied. in e <dig> bootstrap, the training data consists of n instances by re-sampling with replacement from the original data of the same size of n. and the test data is the set difference between original data and training data. thus, if the training data has j unique instances, then the test data will be the other n-j instances on the original data. the error rate on the test data is treated as the e <dig> estimator, while the . <dig> bootstrap also takes the training error into consideration, and uses the linear combination of  <dig> ∗ε +  <dig> ∗e <dig> as the estimated error rate, where ε is the training error. for good error estimation, we use ≈ <dig> iterations
 <cit>  and report the average error rate.

bagging
 <cit> , boosting
 <cit> , random forest
 <cit> , nearest shrunken centroid method 
 <cit> , and random forest variable selection 
 <cit>  ensemble learning techniques are employed as benchmark methods. the ensemble size used for these methods is the same as the one used for spice.

we utilize different skill metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1-measure, variance, heidke skill score 
 <cit> , peirce skill score 
 <cit> , and gerrity skill score 
 <cit> . accuracy is defined as the ratio of the number of correctly classified data points to the total number of data points in the test set. the hss measures how well a forecast did as to a randomly selected forecast. pss, also called “true skill statistic,” is another popularly skill score computed by the difference between the hit rate and the false alarm rate. gss, also known as “threat” score or critical success index, is a particular useful measure of skill for situations where the occurrences of the event to be forecast are substantially less frequent than the non-occurrences
 <cit> .

skill metrics evaluation
figure
 <dig> shows cross validation accuracy of spice compared to bagging, boosting, random forest, pam, and varselrf ensemble methods. we report the accurate results of bagging, boosting, random forest, pam, and varselrf by using the default parameters. cart decision tree is used as the base classifier for bagging, boosting, and spice. to be consistent, we use  <dig> iterations as the stopping criterion  for all the methods. spice outperforms bagging, boosting, random forest, pam and varselrf by up to 33%, 13%, 18%, 10%, and 24%, respectively.

table
 <dig> summarizes spice’s skill on two-class microarray data using five metrics: accuracy and its variance, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and f1-measure; it also reports an average number of features per model. table
 <dig> summarizes spice’s skill on multi-class microarray data using five metrics: accuracy and its variance, hss, pss, and gss.

different weighting schemes’ test
one factor that may influence the results of spice method is the weights assigned to different candidate classifiers in the ensemble for determining the phenotype. here, we test three different weighting schemes described in step 5: bringing component interplays altogether section: majority voting, training accuracy-based voting, and internal cross-validation-based voting. the experimental results show that there is no bearing on prediction accuracy by choosing different weighting schemes for a majority of microarray datasets, although the training accuracy-based voting and internal cross-validation-based voting performed slightly better  than the majority voting scheme on few datasets like the b-cell lymphoma dataset. however, all weighting schemes highly outperformed any single classifier in the ensemble.

robustness assessment
to assess robustness, we applied bootstrapping using both e <dig> and . <dig> bootstrap estimators with  <dig> bootstrapping trials. bootstrapping is applied to all three categories of data sets. leukemia data is the original 2-class data without any preprocessing, cns data is the discretized data, and lymphoma_3class data is multi-class data with logarithmic transformation and standardization. table
 <dig> shows that spice provides bootstrap error rates comparable with cross-validation results.

ensemble statistics
figure
 <dig> shows the ensembles built by spice on leukemia and lymphoma_3class data, using  <dig> or fewer classifier models ), with each model including 2– <dig> features ). the fact that the ensemble uses information from multiple diverse models and achieves a good accuracy with only a few features per model is a good indicator for our classifier ensemble methodology.

algorithm efficiency
figure
 <dig> shows the runtime of spice and the benchmark methods on eight microarray datasets with  <dig> iterations as the stopping criterion. our experiments were conducted on a pc with an intel core  <dig> duo cpu  and 6gb of ram. all algorithms were implemented in the matlab programming language.

for the eight datasets we tested, it shows that our spice algorithm is much faster than bagging and boosting. while spice is slower than random forest on some datasets, spice could achieve better prediction accuracy on those datasets.

generalization
spice can be considered one of meta-learning ensemble algorithms
 <cit> , because spice can employ an arbitrary base classifier. table
 <dig> shows its effectiveness compared to a single classifier using different base classifiers on the colon cancer dataset with the 10-fold cross-validation. spice improves the prediction accuracy of a single classifier, namely by about 30%, 14%, and 7% for naïve bayes, cart decision tree, and linear svm, respectively. thus, spice can be applied to improve some base classifiers other than decision tree, which makes spice more useful.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we addressed the important and challenging problem of enumerating statistically significant and application-relevant component interplays that are key contributors to the system’s phenotype. we presented spice, an effective, iterative feature subsets enumeration method that discriminates between different systems’ phenotypic states on both instance-based data and network-based data. spice successfully identified cancer-related genes from various microarray data sets and found enzymes or cogs associated with biohydrogen production and motility phenotype by microbial organisms. spice also improved the predictive skill of the system’s phenotype determination by up to 10% relative to individual classifiers and/or other ensemble methods, such as bagging, boosting, random forest, nearest shrunken centroid, and random forest variable selection method.
