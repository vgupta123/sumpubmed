BACKGROUND
it is well known that total gene numbers are similar among multicellular eukaryotes, and genome size does not correlate with organism complexity, which differs greatly in terms of development, physiology and behavior among eukaryotes  <cit> . the transcriptome and its regulation contribute significantly to eukaryotic diversity in the aforementioned complexity. the functional annotation of the transcriptome of mammalian genome  projects  have demonstrated the complexity of transcriptomes in several aspects, including non-coding rnas  <cit> , antisense transcription  <cit> , regulated retrotransposon expression  <cit> , and alternative promoter usage, splicing and polyadenylation  <cit> .

recent high-throughput rna-seq  <cit>  technologies have provided unprecedented capability to analyze cellular, tissue-specific, or organismal gene activities across a broad spectrum. it also revealed the transcriptomic complexity during cell differentiation  <cit>  and organ development  <cit> . furthermore, individuals of the same species have transcriptomic differences such as expression variation among humans  <cit> . another level of transcriptomic complexities has been revealed by extensive analysis of novel splicing variants from known exons  <cit> . in addition, thousands of transcripts from previously unannotated  genomic regions have been reported  <cit> ; they are either named tuf   <cit>  or unannotated tar   <cit> . some of the unannotated tars are large intergenic noncoding rnas that function in embryonic stem cell pluripotency and cell proliferation  <cit> , while most unannotated tars have no known function.

it has been reported that undifferentiated human stem cells have elevated expression of unannotated tars compared with differentiated neural progenitor cells  <cit> . our recent study has also detected additional transcripts from intergenic regions and introns in mouse embryonic and neonatal brain cortices  <cit> . mammalian neural development is a complex process involving cell division, cell differentiation, cell migration, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. the characterization of stage specific unannotated tars during early brain development could provide clues regarding the roles these unannotated tars might play in determining neural fate and in regulating neuronal functions.

to further investigate the transcriptome dynamics and to better understand the possible roles of unannotated tars in early neural development, we have analyzed the rna-seq datasets from embryonic and postnatal mouse brain cortices that we generated recently  <cit> , as well as seven additional rna-seq datasets covering both neural and non-neural tissues  <cit> . these nine transcriptome datasets include data from human embryonic stem cell  and its subsequently differentiated forms   <cit> , embryonic day  <dig>  and postnatal day  <dig>  mouse brain cortices  <cit> , and adult mouse brain , liver , and muscle   <cit> .

through a systematic analysis of these nine datasets, we found several unique characteristics of the transcriptomes in early neural development. we found that, although the genome was not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported  <cit> , most of the genomic regions at  <dig> mb resolution had detectable rna-seq signals. we also found that the transcriptomes from neural tissues possessed several genome-wide characteristics resembling those of stem cells. interestingly, the e <dig> cortex shows the highest level of unannotated transcript expression compared to p <dig> and adult brains. furthermore, the intronic unannotated transcripts are associated with go terms for neurogenesis, neural signaling and negative regulation. importantly, few of the unannotated tars in e <dig> and p <dig> cortices are connected with known transcripts, suggesting potential novel functions of these tars during brain development.

RESULTS
mapping rna-seq data from mouse developing brains and other organs
to examine the genomic distribution of transcriptomic reads, we mapped all rna-seq data by the tophat software  <cit> , which was designed to map rna-seq data with moderate it  infrastructure. embryonic, neonatal and adult mouse data were mapped onto the mouse reference genome  as described in the methods section. for comparison, adult mouse liver and muscle rna-seq data were analyzed in the same manner. human esc and its differentiation data were mapped onto the human reference genome . only uniquely matched reads were further analyzed. because the amounts of data available for the downstream analysis varied for different tissues , the read count data were first normalized against the available dataset size, measured in base pairs, for each tissue. to accommodate differences in the details of library preparation and sequencing procedures, we adjusted for the sequencing quality in all data sets according to the quality computation method of the illumina  <dig>  pipeline. e <dig> and p <dig> rna-seq data had the largest percentage of mappable reads in this group, approximately 60%, while other data sets had about 30% mappable data. the amb rna-seq data had the largest quantity, with more than  <dig>  million mapped base pairs.

most 1-mb genomic regions have transcriptional activity with uneven distribution at a finer scale
despite a dataset size up to  <dig>  mbp , only about 2% of the mouse genome had been mapped with rna-seq reads, unlike a previous report that suggested a more pervasively transcribed genome from detailed analyses of ~1% of the human genome  <cit> . a recent study using single- and paired-end rna-seq and tiling arrays also concluded that the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported  <cit> . nevertheless, when the mouse genome was divided into  <dig> million base-pair long intervals, we observed that 85% of the intervals had  <dig> or more detected rna-seq reads . however, the majority of chromosome regions of the  <dig> kb size had no detected transcription, as illustrated for x-chromosome . whereas many regions showed transcription at both the e <dig> and p <dig> stages, some regions were specifically active in one of these stages, suggesting that a selective set of genes are turned on and off from embryonic to neonatal brain stages, consistent with the previous finding of preferential expression of several thousand genes at either one of these stages  <cit> . besides heterochromatin regions , some large genomic regions with very low annotated gene content had no detectable reads, including several regions in chromosome  <dig>  and the region in chromosome Ã— from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> bp .

after further dividing the genome into  <dig> kb intervals, most of the  <dig> kb intervals had no detected transcription . most of the reads in highly expressed intervals  were mapped to known exons. among intervals with  <dig>  to  <dig>  detected reads, more intervals had intergenic transcripts than intronic transcripts, with very few intervals having all three types  of transcripts. for intervals with  <dig> or more rna-seq reads, there were  <dig> times more intervals expressing intronic signal in e <dig> stage than in p <dig> stage. the e <dig> stage also had slightly more intervals with intergenic transcripts than the p <dig> stage, although the numbers of intervals with exonic transcripts were similar between the two stages .

we found that expression level was positively correlated with the exon contents of a given interval. the higher exon percentage an interval had, the higher the number of detected rna-seq reads in the interval. at  <dig> mb interval size, the pearson's correlation coefficient between exonic read number and exonic content percentage was  <dig> ; in contrast, the pearson's correlation coefficient between intronic read number and exonic content percentage was only  <dig> . the pearson's correlation coefficient between intergenic read number and exonic content percentage was also quite low, at  <dig>  . at  <dig> kb interval size, the correlation decreased but the general trend was maintained . while the exon-rich regions had more reads for exons than introns or intergenic regions, the exon-sparse regions had similar numbers of intronic and intergenic reads as the exon-rich region. in addition, at  <dig> mb resolution, the exonic expression level had modestly positive correlation with both intronic  and intergenic expression level  in the same region . however, at  <dig> kb resolution, the aforementioned correlation became very weak .

transcriptomic comparison between neural tissues and other tissues
to understand the neural transcriptome characteristics, we compared mouse cortical rna-seq data at e <dig> and p <dig> stages with available adult mouse brain, liver, and muscle rna-seq data  <cit> , as well as rna-seq data from human embryonic stem cells  and neural cells  immediately differentiated from hesc  <cit> . we first analyzed transcriptome properties at the chromosome level, using a method slightly modified from mortazavi et al.  <cit>  as detailed in the methods section, and labeled as rpkm* ).

in addition to the above-mentioned mapping of the  <dig> mouse datasets , we also mapped the  <dig> human rna-seq datasets  onto the mouse reference genome . based on the 85% identity calculated from coding regions between mouse and human genome previously  <cit> , there would be on average  <dig> mismatches per  <dig> bp rna-seq read length. we found that the threshold of  <dig> mismatches per  <dig> bp read achieved the best balance between specificity and sensitivity for this cross-species mapping. increasing the number of allowed mismatches resulted in fewer uniquely and correctly mapped reads, while decreasing this number resulted in fewer total mappable reads. with the threshold of allowing maximum  <dig> mismatches for rna-seq mapping, this would mean little cross-species mappable reads if the differences between coding regions of human and mouse were distributed evenly. surprisingly, on average 6% of the total human rna-seq reads could be mapped to the mouse genome, or  <dig> % of the reads mappable to the human genome. the majority  of the reads mapped to the mouse genome were also mapped to the human genome.

we then compared the chromosomal expression profile between mouse  and human  samples. despite the fact that smaller fractions of the human reads were mapped onto the mouse reference genome, largely due to dna sequence similarity between these two species, both mouse and human neural data sets were highly similar in terms of expression level relative to total mapped reads at the scale of individual chromosomes . furthermore, all neural tissues had similar profiles to that of stem cells, but quite different from those of adult liver and muscle, particularly for some chromosomes, such as  <dig> and  <dig> . to summarize the above information, we applied correspondence analysis on the chromosomal expression profile. the chromosomal expression distribution among all stages, using mouse genome as reference, was first measured in read counts . correspondence analysis  was performed using the ca package in r  <cit> . the first two dimensions resulted from the ca could explain 96% of the differences in the original  <dig> Ã—  <dig> dimensions, which indicated that the first two dimensions were representative . the result was plotted using these two dimensions . e <dig> and p <dig> were clustered together with hesc, n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  amb was also very close to the aforementioned cluster. aml and amm were significantly further away than amb.

as an alternative way to compare the mouse and human data, we also mapped the human data onto the human reference genome , for comparative analysis using previously identified syntenic/orthologous genomic regions between mouse and human  <cit> . these studies defined  <dig> conserved syntenic blocks between the human and mouse genomes. chromosomal expression profiles in early-differentiated human neural cells were very similar to that of human embryonic stem cells . even with different chromosome numbers and organizations, neural chromosomal expression profiles were also very similar between human neural cells and mouse neural tissue samples between syntenic/orthologous genomic regions . for example, the most highly expressed chromosome in mouse was chromosome  <dig>  whose human counterpart is chromosome  <dig>  which was the second most highly expressed chromosome in human. the most highly expressed chromosome in human was chromosome  <dig>  whose mouse counterparts are distributed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  among which chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were also highly expressed in neural tissues.

to assess the variation in expression levels between chromosomes for different tissues/organs, we calculated the standard deviation for the distribution of individual chromosome expression level, or rpkm* values, for each mapped transcriptome dataset . we found that the standard deviation for e <dig> was the lowest among mouse samples, while the standard deviation for the stem cells was the lowest in human samples . these results indicated that the mouse e <dig> brain cortex and human embryonic stem cells use chromosomes more evenly than other organs/tissues.

it is well known that the brain has a very high metabolic rate, consuming a significant amount of energy while lacking substantial energy reserve tissues. thus normal brain functions depend on mitochondria as the crucial energy provider. to examine the mitochondrial genome expression-level changes across different developmental stages, we plotted the normalized mitochondrial expression level, measured in rpkm*, across all nine datasets and normalized against the dataset size. we found that in human datasets, compared with stem cells, differentiated neural cells had a higher level of mitochondrial expression , increasing from the n <dig> to n <dig> stages, then maintaining a similarly high level at the n <dig> stage. similarly in the mouse brain, mitochondrial expression progressively increased from the e <dig> embryonic stage to the p <dig> neonatal stage, then to the adult stage. the adult mouse brain had a similar level of mitochondrial expression to that of the adult liver, while the adult mouse muscle had the highest level of mitochondrial expression among all analyzed organs/tissues, consistent with high energy demand for muscle contraction.

to assess the similarity between neural and stem cell transcriptomes further, we compared the transcriptomes between human and mouse using only 1-to- <dig> orthologous gene pairs between these species. a total of  <dig> orthologous gene pairs were identified using the mgi  orthology database. the expression level of each gene was measured in rpkm, with the modification that detected base pairs from exons were used instead of read number in the rpkm formula to accommodate read length differences between datasets. again the expression level for a given gene at a given stage was normalized against the rna-seq dataset size. we then added  <dig> to the calculated expression level value for each gene, to ensure valid logarithm transformation. the calculated value was then log <dig> transformed. we first calculated the gene expression correlation between hesc and the rest of the samples. as expected, the correlation was high between hesc and the cells derived from hesc. among the rest, e <dig> had the highest correlation with hesc , and p <dig> had the second highest . the data were then analyzed in mev  from the tm <dig> suite  <cit> . after using different clustering methods  and different distance calculation methods , we found that neural datasets from human and mouse were consistently grouped together with the stem cell dataset, separate from the liver and muscle datasets . this suggested that the neural and stem cell transcriptomes were globally more similar in terms of orthologous gene expression than they were to liver and muscle transcriptomes.

we then further analyzed the correlation of the expression in two different tissues/stages among co-expressed genes between the tissues/stages . among all mouse samples, although e <dig> was the one with the highest correlation with hesc, e <dig> was still more similar to mouse neural transcriptomes in terms of expression level correlation. in particular, e <dig> and p <dig> transcriptomes were much more correlated with each other than with hesc, suggesting that the similarity between e <dig> or p <dig> cortex and hesc is relatively limited.

we also analyzed the genes associated with the pluripotency of stem cells. sox <dig>  myc, oct <dig> and klf <dig>  which are four genes that have been found in multiple studies to convert human and mouse somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem  cells  <cit> . similarly, oct <dig> and sox <dig>  plus two other factors, nanog and lin28a, were also able to induce ips cells from human somatic cells  <cit> . we found that sox <dig>  myc and klf <dig> were detectable in all neural samples we analyzed . specifically, the e <dig> stage had the highest sox <dig> and myc expression among all mouse samples. however, nanog and lin28a were not detected at either the e <dig> or p <dig> stage. rt-pcr experiment was also carried out with primers specifically targeting sox <dig>  myc and klf <dig>  the results supported the expression of sox <dig>  myc and klf <dig> in e <dig> and p <dig> cortices . due to the presence of multiple homologues of oct <dig>  in the mouse genome, neither rna-seq nor rt-pcr could identify specific expression for oct4/pou5f <dig>  interestingly, sox <dig>  which encodes a transcription factor and was previously reported to be expressed in glial cells  <cit> , was highly expressed in the e <dig> cortex and significantly down-regulated in the p <dig> cortex . because cortical neurons are mainly generated at the late embryonic stage whereas glial cells are mainly generated in the postnatal stage, the high level expression of sox <dig> in the e <dig> cortex suggests an additional role during early brain development besides its proposed function in glial cells.

expression characteristics of genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders
we further analyzed the expression of genes potentially associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in both neural tissues and stem cells. autism spectrum disorders , together with schizophrenia and mental retardation, are typically characterized as neurodevelopmental disorders. genome-wide association studies  have identified many genes related to asd. among these genes, many have been found to relate to the gabaergic neurotransmission system. here, we analyzed the expression of  <dig> genes encoding different gabaa receptor subunits and  <dig> genes that have been proposed to be associated with asd  <cit>  . although gaba receptor genes in general showed low expression levels in non-neural tissue and stem cells, the gene for gabaar alpha <dig>  subunit showed a very high level of expression in hescs, which lacks a gabaergic system, suggesting a novel function of this gene in embryonic stem cells. its expression was not detectable after initial differentiation  and then observed again after further differentiating into neural cells . it also showed an increase from e <dig> to p <dig>  but a reduction from p <dig> to adult brain, consistent with more restricted localization in the adult brain  <cit> . in addition, gabrq and gabrp also showed modest expression in hescs. furthermore, the gene encoding the gabaar delta  subunit showed the highest expression level among all gabaar subunit genes in the adult brain. since delta is specifically localized at extrasynaptic sites and mediates tonic inhibition rather than normal fast inhibition, this result emphasizes the importance of tonic inhibition in regulating adult brain activity. finally, genes for gabab receptor  subunits showed significant differential expression during brain development, with gabbr <dig> dominant from e <dig> through adult brain while gabbr <dig> only expressed highly in the adult brain.

among genes associated with asd, rgs <dig>  dtnbp <dig>  nlgn <dig>  stx <dig>  mecp <dig>  arvcf, and ppp3cc all showed high-level expression from the embryonic to adult brain. one important finding was that while both nlgn <dig> and nlgn <dig> showed high-level expression at the e <dig> to p <dig> stages, consisting with their synaptogenic functions, nlgn <dig> expression was significantly reduced in the adult brain, suggesting that the relevant function might be fulfilled by other cell adhesion molecules. this is also consistent with the current understanding that many cell adhesion molecules can trigger glutamatergic synapse formation as nlgn <dig> does, but only nlgn <dig> is capable of inducing gabaergic synaptogenesis  <cit> . one surprising finding is that disc <dig>  a well-studied gene associated with schizophrenia  <cit> , showed very low expression at the e18/p <dig> stages and still low in adult brain. however, disc <dig> was modestly expressed in hescs and the expression decreased after neural differentiation, suggesting that disc <dig> might play an important role in stem cell functions.

detection of unusually high levels of unannotated transcript expression level at e <dig> and p <dig> stages
to obtain an accurate set of unannotated tars, we first subtracted the tars overlapping with annotated exons, trnas or rrnas. we then removed tars overlapping with repeats. we also excluded tars within  <dig> kb vicinity of the first and last exon to avoid promoter, tss and tts associated transcription activity, which have been previously studied  <cit> . we call the set of unannotated tars generated from the aforementioned procedure the filtered unannotated tars, and they include both intronic tars and intergenic tars. we found that the e <dig> stage had the highest percentages of both intronic and intergenic reads, at 5% and 3% of the e <dig> total data, respectively . p <dig> stage had the second highest percentages, with about  <dig> % and  <dig> % for introns and intergenic regions, respectively. in comparison, almost all the other datasets had less than 1% of the data matching intronic or intergenic regions. among human samples, surprisingly, the stem cell stage had the lowest percentage of unannotated tars, while the neural progenitor cell n <dig> stage had the highest. this result is different from a previous report  <cit> , which did not use methods that rigorously removed repeats as in this study.

concordant changes in expression levels between intronic tars and flanking exons
to investigate the relationship between an intronic tar and its flanking exons, we examined their respective expression levels . there were  <dig> genes with intronic tars at either the e <dig> or p <dig> stage. we found a strong positive correlation between the intronic expression and the flanking exonic expression. from e <dig> to p <dig>  we found  <dig> genes with decreased intronic expression levels; among these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  also had decreased exonic expression . even more strikingly,  <dig> genes had increased intronic expression level from e <dig> to p <dig> , with  <dig>  having increased exonic expression levels. the correlation was highly significant, with a p-value of  <dig>  from fisher's exact test for the association of the exonic and intronic expression levels.

few unannotated tars were connected with known exons
the strong concordant correlation between the previously unannotated intronic tars and flanking exons suggested that the intronic tar and its flanking exon might be parts of the same rna transcript. to test this hypothesis, we focused on the e <dig> and p <dig> datasets, which had the largest percentage of filtered unannotated tars. a paired-end read with one end located in the unannotated tar and the other in a known exon would be strong evidence that this intronic tar and the known exon are parts of the same mrna. however, it is in principle possible that the mapping positions could be erroneous. in addition, the existing mathematical and statistical models for determining the connection between tars  <cit>  are designed for rna-seq data from cdnas generated with random primers. they are not applicable to poly-dt primed data, which have a 3' bias. so we first devised a model suitable for both priming techniques ), which reports the presence of the physical connection between expressed tars and known exons. using known adjacent exons and single exon genes  with detected reads as positive and negative controls in a simulation, the formula had success rates of 93% and 100%, respectively.

using formula  <dig>  we found that only a very small percentage of the unannotated intronic tars were connected with known exons  as supported by the rna-seq reads. although a large fraction  of the unannotated tars was found to be connected to other regions mapped elsewhere, these mapped regions were very short, fragmented and unannotated regions with low read coverage. surprisingly, some unannotated tars were connected to read ends that mapped to multiple chromosomes, possibly due to mapping to repetitive sequences, erroneous mapping or possible cross-chromosome splicing , a rare phenomenon that was previously observed  <cit> .

comparing the intronic tars with known mrna and est in ncbi databases
to test whether there is other evidence for the intronic tars, we searched the data in ncbi's cdna/mrna and est databases. among  <dig> intronic tars detected at e <dig> stage,  <dig>  had no matches in ncbi databases. similarly, among  <dig> intronic tars at p <dig> stage,  <dig>  had no matches in ncbi databases. therefore, our results provide the first evidence for these tars being expressed. among the matching ncbi database entries,  <dig>  of the  <dig> for the e <dig> stage and  <dig>  of the  <dig> for the p <dig> stage were from the same stages, but none of them was from the brain cortex.

we then examined the splicing pattern of the mrna and est records matched to our detected intronic tars and found two classes of intronic tars:  with records suggesting that the tars were standalone, without connection to known exons;  with some records suggesting that the tars were standalone while other records suggesting that they were connected to known exons.  <dig> out of  <dig>  intronic tars at e <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig>  intronic tars at p <dig> belonged to the first class. for the second class of intronic tars, on average, the ratios for records supporting standalone transcripts to those for connections to known exons were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the e <dig> and p <dig> stages, respectively. taking together, the comparison with ncbi's cdna/mrna and est databases strongly suggested that most of our detected intronic tars were not connected with known exons and thus were novel transcripts.

comparing the intronic tars with known records in mirbase and lncrnadb
we then compared our intronic tars in mirna database mirbase  <cit>  and long non-coding rna database lncrnadb  <cit> . although we found no significant hits in these two databases for any intronic tars observed at p <dig> stage, we did find  <dig> and  <dig> hits for intronic tars at e <dig> stage in mirbase and lncrnadb, respectively . however, all  <dig> intronic tars with hits in lncrnadb were mapped to the same lncrna, b <dig> sine rna, which was from a sine repeat element. in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> intronic tars having hits in mirbase mapped to the same mir- <dig> mirna, and the remaining one mapped to mir-153- <dig>  otherwise, we did not detect significant hits for other types of rnas.

sequence conservation and coding potential of intronic tars
to obtain clues about possible function of the intronic tars using sequence similarity to other mammalian genes, we investigated whether unannotated tars corresponded to any highly conserved region using the 30-way multiz alignment & conservation track in ucsc genome browser  <cit> . we found that there were  <dig> and  <dig> unannotated tars at e <dig> and p <dig> stages, respectively; among these,  <dig> in e <dig> and  <dig> in p <dig> matched regions of highly conserved sequences. for example, a tar on chromosome  <dig>  was localized to an intron of the mouse pcbp <dig> gene encoding the major cellular poly-binding protein  <cit> . in addition, there were rna-seq reads spanning this intronic tar and the upstream exon , indicating that this previously unannoted tar was spliced with a known exon. moreover, this tar had a significant overlap with a highly conserved region located in the 3' most intron, which was identified by mammalian conservation study using 30-way multiz alignment & conservation track data   <cit> . an open reading frame  was also predicted inside this tar and was conserved among the pcbp <dig> genes of human and dog , but not opossum. pcr and abi  <dig> resequencing results further verified that this tar is indeed part of an mrna  with a connection between this tar and the upstream exon, consistent with rna-seq results. however, pcr product between this intronic tar and the downstream exon was not detected, in agreement with the rna-seq results. this tar was very likely to represent an alternative 3' utr with a potential coding region.

in addition, an intronic tar with an orf inside the atp2b <dig> gene located on chromosome  <dig>  shares  <dig> % identity to the 20th exon of human atp2b <dig> isoform a  . human atp2b <dig> has two splicing variants: atb2b1a and atb2b1b, which differ in the usage of the 20th exon. previous studies showed that atp2b1a has a specific expression at synapses whereas atb2b1b is expressed in most tissues  <cit> . thus this tar is likely to encode a neuron-specific exon of the mouse atp2b <dig> gene. we also found another expressed region on chromosome  <dig>  that shares  <dig> % identity with a part of the second 3' utr exon of the human trim <dig> gene . trim <dig>  is expressed in the brain and encodes a ring finger protein that regulates gabar cell surface expression  <cit> . another intronic tar located in the nrxn <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  has the potential for coding neurexin  <dig>  a neuronal cell adhesion molecule interacting with neuroligins to promote synapse formation and maturation  <cit> . the orfs in these intronic tars were highly similar to parts of human atp2b <dig>  berp and nrxn <dig> genes, respectively. a number of other intronic tars, such as those in chd <dig>  tsc <dig>  and srcap, were either similar to known human exons or supported by mouse gene predictions and mrna and/or est data in the ncbi database.

three other intronic tars were located, respectively, in the zeb <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> , the ntrk <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> , and the odz <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> , within introns that are more than  <dig> kb long. these tars did not match mrna or est records in the ncbi database, nor were they similar to protein sequences in the ncbi database. nevertheless, these three tars were conserved in rat, human, dog and opossum genomes, matching annotated introns in the orthologous genes in human and rat . our rna-seq data did not detect physical connection between the tars and known exons; the lack of connection between the tars and the flanking exons were further supported by the observations that pcr was successful when both primers were located inside a particular intronic tar, but not able to generate products when a primer in the intronic tar region was combined with another primer in one of the flanking exons . as a control, the correct pcr product was obtained using primers matching the two flanking exons of the given intronic tar . therefore, these three intronic tars were most likely standalone transcripts that were not linked with the flanking exons.

genes with intronic tars were over-represented in go terms closely associated with neural development
although we have found that few of these intronic tars were physically connected with the exons of the corresponding genes in the same mrna, the fact the same genomic regions encode both the transcripts with exons and the intronic tars suggests some association between these intronic tars and the exonic genes. to further examine the functional implication of the intronic tars, it is informative to study the corresponding genes. to study the nature of proteins encoded by the genes with intronic tars, we analyzed their enrichment in biological process gene ontology  using agrigo  <cit> . the go annotations for all expressed genes at either stage were used as a reference for comparison to determine possible enrichment of specific go categories. a total of  <dig> unique genes contained filtered intronic tars among a total of  <dig> genes with detected reads at e <dig>  while only  <dig> genes contained filtered intronic tars among  <dig> genes expressed at p <dig>  e <dig> data had  <dig> statistically overrepresented go terms, but p <dig> data only had  <dig> statistically overrepresented go terms,  <dig> of which are shared between these stages. the  <dig> overrepresented go terms could be mapped onto only  <dig> major branches: neural signaling , neurogenesis  and regulation . the go terms of these branches are closely related with neural developmental events occurring at e <dig> stages.

for neural signaling related go terms at e <dig>  two subgroups form largely parallel interactions: the first subgroup mainly functions in regulating neural system process, while the second subgroup carries out signal transmission . the terminal node was the regulation of synaptic transmission, which combines the aforementioned two functions. among the nodes with strong statistical support were "transmission of nerve impulse", "neurological system process", and "synaptic transmission". another interesting aspect is that the regulatory relations in the first subgroup were positive, while they were negative in the second subgroup. for neural signaling related go terms at p <dig>  however, only one function group, similar to the aforementioned 2nd subgroup, was identified. it had  <dig> nodes and the regulatory relations between the nodes were negative .

nearly half  of the enriched go terms were for neurogenesis, with extensive interconnections between nodes and no obvious functional subgroups . the functions of these nodes include many aspects of neural development, such as cell morphogenesis, neurogenesis and neuron differentiation, eventually diverging into two termini:  axongenesis and axon guidance and  dendrite morphogenesis. it is also striking that all regulatory relationships were negative.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the third major group of overrepresented go terms at e <dig> was for regulation. they were mainly about negative regulations, consistent with the negative regulatory relations identified between the majority of the nodes for neural signaling and neurogenesis groups. specifically, strong statistical support was found for negative regulation of "metabolic process", of "gene expression" and of "biosynthetic process", ending in that of rna polymerase ii-dependent transcription. for p <dig>  only one node received strong statistical support: regulation of molecular function .

because axon guidance is critical for correct formation of the neural circuit during neural development, we then further analyzed the axon guidance node at e <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes with filtered intronic tars were assigned to this node by go. according to the kegg pathway database  <cit> , among the  <dig> genes, robo <dig>  robo <dig>  nrp <dig>  dcc, ephb <dig> and ephb <dig> were all receptors involved in axon guidance pathway. they were all involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton dynamics and axon repulsion activity. the average ratio of intronic read number to exonic read number for these  <dig> genes was  <dig>  at e <dig>  but was  <dig>  at p <dig> . as a comparison, we also examined three well-known genes: myc, Î²-actin  and tubulin , and found that their expression levels  were very similar between e <dig> and p <dig>  however, the average ratios of intronic read number to exonic read number for these three genes were  <dig>  and  <dig>  at e <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. these ratios were less than 1/ <dig>  or 1/ <dig>  of those for the  <dig> axon guidance associated genes. from a different perspective, for the  <dig> axon guidance associated genes, the average exonic reads ratio  was  <dig> , suggesting a slight reduction in expression. in contrast, while the average intronic reads ratio  was  <dig> , representing a much bigger reduction of the intronic transcripts. as a reference, the  <dig> house keeping genes had an average ratio of  <dig>  for e18/p <dig> exonic reads, whereas the intronic read numbers for the  <dig> genes were too low to compare accurately. therefore, the  <dig> axon guidance-related genes had significantly more intronic reads than exonic reads  and more so at e <dig> than p <dig> , suggesting a possible role of these intronic transcripts in modulating axon guidance at e <dig> cortex.

neural and stem cell transcriptome
in this study, we have investigated global characteristics of embryonic and neonatal neural transcriptomes, and compared with transcriptomes of the adult brain and embryonic stem cells. we found that embryonic and neonatal brain cortex transcriptomes correspond to most genomic regions at large scale of megabase intervals, but are unevenly distributed with positive correlation to exon density. in addition, neural transcriptomes are similar to that of embryonic stem cells, more than those of liver and muscle, in several features including chromosome level expression , and expression pattern of orthologous genes . also, the e <dig> brain cortex transcriptome and hesc transcriptome showed relatively even chromosomal distribution and had lower mitochondrial expression.

other than these global similarities, we noted another shared characteristic between neural expressed genes and genes important for pluripotent stem cells. specifically, three genes, sox <dig>  myc and klf <dig> were detectable in all six neural samples , with high levels in e <dig> or p <dig> transcriptomes. the expression of these genes suggests that neural cells might need fewer factors to be converted to stem cells. indeed kim et al found that only two factors , instead of four, were needed to revert neural stem cell to ips cells  <cit> . therefore, the similarity in transcriptome, including the expression of specific genes, such as sox <dig>  myc and klf <dig>  between neural cells and stem cells suggests that neural cells might retain certain stem cell properties and have greater potential to be reprogrammed to be pluripotent.

intronic tars as standalone rna regulators in early brain development
the mapping results of our transcriptome datasets revealed significant levels of intronic reads. we found that only a small portion of the intronic transcripts that we detected was on the same rnas with any known exons. recently, klevebring et al. have reported that about 50% of the intronic expression was actually from the antisense strand  <cit> , different from the sense exon-containing mrnas of the same gene. thus the intronic tars detected here share some characteristic with the antisense transcripts, although our data lacked the strand information. our finding that the level of intronic transcript is positively correlated with that of flanking exons is consistent with previous studies that antisense transcription may have both concordant and discordant regulation relative to the adjacent exons  <cit> . furthermore, faghihi et al. also reported regulation involving antisense rna not mediated by the conventional rna interference pathway  <cit> , indicating additional mechanisms are important. our results that the e <dig> brain cortex has significantly higher levels of intronic transcripts than other tissues/organs strongly suggest that such non-coding transcripts play important roles in regulating gene expression during embryonic brain development.

we also found that the mouse e <dig> embryonic brain had a concordant relation between intronic transcript and flanking exonic expression. this is unlike previous studies showing preferential localization of antisense transcripts in the upstream and downstream regions of the gene  <cit> . our data have further indicated that the e <dig> embryonic brain showed enrichment of genes with intronic tars in go categories that are closely associated with neural functions. the e <dig> cortical neurons are actively engaged in neurogenesis, including axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. for the significant go terms associated with neurogenesis, all the regulatory relations between nodes were negative . moreover, an entire group of significant nodes was about negative regulation . however, at p <dig>  intronic tars were no longer associated with either neurogenesis or negative regulation. these findings suggest the involvement of intronic tars in stage-specific regulation of neural developmental.

recently, a subset of long ncrnas was found to have an enhancer-like function  <cit> . our data also indicated a correlation between the change in intronic transcript expression level and the change in the expression level of the corresponding gene. for example, the increased intronic expression is correlated with increased exonic expression for  <dig> axon guidance associated genes, whereas such correlation was not found for a control set of  <dig> housekeeping genes. the positive correlation in expression change between intronic tars and the flanking exons further supports the idea that they have regulatory interactions, although it is formally possible that the intronic transcripts have functions unrelated to the genes represented by the flanking exons.

our transcriptome analyses have revealed possible important mechanisms for gene function and its regulation in the developing brain, and uncovered a strong similarity to stem cells. these results provide a number of novel insights regarding neural developmental gene functions that can be further investigated using molecular genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological experiments.
