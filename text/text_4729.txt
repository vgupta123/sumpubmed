BACKGROUND
antigenic epitopes are regions of protein surface that are preferentially recognized by antibodies. prediction of antigenic epitopes can help during the design of vaccine components and immuno-diagnostic reagents, but predicting effective epitopes is still an open problem in bioinformatics. usually, b-cell antigenic epitopes are classified as either continuous or discontinuous. the majority of available epitope prediction methods focus on continuous epitopes  <cit> .

although discontinuous epitopes dominate most antigenic epitope families  <cit> , due to their computational complexity, only a very limited number of prediction methods exist for discontinuous epitope prediction: cep  <cit> , discotope  <cit> , pepito  <cit> , ellipro  <cit> , seppa  <cit> , epitopia <cit>  and our previous work, epces  <cit> . all discontinuous epitope prediction methods require the three-dimensional structure of the antigenic protein. the small number of available antigen-antibody complex structures limits the development of reliable discontinuous epitope prediction methods and an unbiased benchmark set is very much in demand  <cit> .

in this work, we developed an antigenic epitope prediction method by using support vector regression  with six attributes: residue epitope propensity, conservation score, side chain energy score, contact number, surface planarity score, and secondary structure composition. further improvement was achieved by incorporating consensus results from a meta server, epmeta, that we constructed using multiple discontinuous epitope prediction servers. the prediction accuracy was validated by an independent test set, in which antigens did not have available antibody-complex structures and epitopes were derived from various biochemical experiments.

RESULTS
prediction for the training set
using the training procedure , we obtained the optimized svr parameters . when c = 2- <dig>  g = 2- <dig>  p = 2- <dig>  the mean value of the auc for the  <dig> targets in the training set reached a maximum of  <dig>  in the leave-one-out test. as a comparison, the mean auc value was  <dig>  when using epces, whose residue interface propensity was derived from the other  <dig> targets using the same leave-one-out procedure. the improvement of epsvr could be attributed to the machine learning method because epsvr and epces use the same six scoring terms. in another study, rubinstein et al. applied support vector classifier  to predict b-cell epitopes and obtained a mean auc value of  <dig>  for a similar non-redundant set of  <dig> antigen-antibody complex structures in cross validation  <cit> . our algorithm showed slightly better performance for a somewhat different training set.

prediction for the test set
we applied our algorithm, with optimally trained parameters, to the independent test set, and achieved a mean auc value of  <dig> , which was lower than that of the training set. nevertheless,  <dig> out of  <dig> targets were predicted with an auc value greater than  <dig> . here, we note that the epitopic residues of antigens in the test set were identified by point mutations, overlapping peptides, and elisa, which are not as accurate as that based on crystal structures.

six antigens in test proteins  contained multiple chains, but we only used a single chain, where the experimental antigenic epitope was located, for prediction. if the whole protein was used for prediction, the mean auc value of the  <dig> proteins decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . when using the single chain in a multimer, we excluded the other chains from the prediction model. when using multiple chains, we considered all chains, and the total number of surface residues was counted for the intact complex structure. unlike antigenic epitopes, the interfaces of protein-protein complexes, especially non-transient complexes, are usually more hydrophobic and conserved than protein surfaces; this makes the exposed protein-protein interfaces relatively easily to distinguish from both the antigenic epitopes and other protein surfaces. in other words, the prediction task for a single chain protein that has both protein-protein binding interfaces and an epitope is easier than that of a complete protein complex.

comparison with other algorithms
the limited number of available antigen-antibody complex structures is one of the main obstacles in developing and testing of antigenic epitope prediction algorithms. current prediction algorithms use most or all of the available antigen-antibody complex structures as training data. an independent test set would be valuable to evaluate new prediction algorithms. here, we compiled  <dig> proteins with epitope information derived from experimental methods other than crystal structures. with this independent test set, we compared our method with five recently developed algorithms: discotope <dig>   <cit> , pepito  <cit> , seppa  <cit> , epitopia  <cit> , and epces  <cit> . the mean auc value of epsvr was  <dig> , and that of the others was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. although epsvr had the best performance, according to the pairwise t-student test, the differences between epsvr and other servers were not statistically significant , partly due to the small number of testing proteins. when 10% of surface residues were returned as predicted epitopic residues by each server, the accuracy was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % for epsvr, epces, discotope <dig> , pepito, seppa, and epitopia, respectively . in a random prediction, the accuracy was  <dig> % . as a specific example, the antigenic epitope of 1jeq was located on a small c-terminal domain and the connection loop was invisible in the crystal structure. the whole c-terminal domain was ignored by epitopia and its auc value was set to  <dig> because it had no prediction for that section at all. excluding 1jeq, epitopia achieved the best average auc value of  <dig>  for the remaining  <dig> targets, while epsvr achieved an accuracy of  <dig>  for the same  <dig> targets. nevertheless, epsvr had better prediction results for targets with a relatively high percentage of mapped antigenic residues, which made a significant contribution to the average prediction accuracy. as a result, epsvr showed overall higher prediction accuracy than epitopia, as shown in fig.  <dig> 

meta method
as shown above, the prediction accuracy of the different methods decreased in the order of epsvr, epces, epitopia, seppa, pepito, and discotope <dig> . for the meta server, the basic idea was that a surface residue is predicted as an epitopic residue if two or more single servers voted for it. in this naive sense, the mean auc values of the  <dig> testing proteins was calculated to be  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  predicted by the top  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> servers, respectively. to adopt a more sophisticated strategy, the top 25% of surface residues were returned as predicted epitopic residues by epsvr, epces, and epitopia. when the number of the predicted residues was increased from 25% to 50%, from 50% to 75%, and from 75% to 100%, seppa, pepito, and discotope <dig>  were, respectively, included in the voting. for example, the new antigenic residues predicted by epsvr, epces, epitopia, and seppa were added to the top 25% residues predicted by epsvr, epces, and epitopia. the prediction started with 1% of the surface residues for each of the four servers and increased in steps of 1% until 50% of surface residues were predicted as antigenic residues. then we added pepito and used five servers to predict the top 50%~75% surface residues and so on. with this method, we achieved a mean auc value of  <dig> , which is higher than all single servers, especially, discotope <dig>  and pepito . the reason that we used this strategy to integrate the various predictions results from our finding that a single server had better prediction accuracy when only a small fraction of the surface residues were predicted as epitopic residues . if 50% of surface residues, for example, were predicted as epitopic residues by the meta server, the prediction accuracy was  <dig> % for the meta server with a voting set including epsvr, epces, and epitopia, where each server output the top 51% surface residues as candidates of antigenic residues. as a comparison, the prediction accuracy was slightly higher , if the meta server also returned 50% of the surface residues as eptitopic residues, but got votes for those returned residues from all of the six servers, where each server output their own top 32% surface residues as candidates of epitopic residues. this approach can be summarized in the following pseudo-code:

n = the total number of surface residues;

e = the number of predicted epitopic residues;

if e ≤25% * n then,

return predictor ;

else if e > 25%*n and e ≤50%*n then,

return predictor ;

else if e > 50% and e ≤75%*n then,

return predictor ;

else if e > 75% and e ≤100%*n then,

return predictor

endif.

rp = p% of surface residues already predicted as epitopic residues;

function predictor

begin

set the prediction of each single server to 0;

do {

increase the prediction of each single server at the step of 1%;

collect residues predicted by at least two of the servers;

} while;

return total epitopic residues;

end.

although epsvr and epces used the same six scoring terms, we found that it was necessary to include both of them in the meta server. when we used a voting server set including only epces, epitopia, and seppa  the average auc value decreased to  <dig>  for the test set. the average auc value predicted by epsvr, epitopia, and seppa  was also lower than that predicted by epsvr, epces, and epitopia in the standard procedure . we also tried to increase the threshold of votes from two to three for a voting server set, but the results did not improve.

CONCLUSIONS
we introduced a svr method to integrate six attributes for discontinuous epitope prediction and a server, epsvr, which can be accessed online. the auc of epsvr is  <dig> , which is higher than that of any other existing single server. although they used the same scoring functions, epsvr exhibited improved performance over epces. this was attributed to the fact that epsvr searched the six-dimensional parameter space of all scores more broadly than the voting method we previously used. furthermore, a meta server, epmeta, combining epsvr and the other existing single servers together, had an auc value of  <dig> , which is higher than any single server, especially, discotope and pepito. we also found that the use of both epsvr and epces, which use the same  <dig> scoring terms, resulted in a higher performance for epmeta than if only one was used.
