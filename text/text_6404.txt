BACKGROUND
triacylglycerols , fatty acyl ester derivatives of glycerol, are a class of neutral lipids that represent the most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in a number of plant species, tags are major storage lipids that accumulate in developing seeds, petals, pollen grains, and fruits  <cit> . plant oils have been used for human consumption and have become important renewable resources as biofuels  <cit> . the enzymatic machinery for the formation of tags is located in the endoplasmic reticulum . tags can then accumulate as oil droplets in the cytoplasm or in specialized oil storage bodies  <cit> , which are generated through budding of the outer er membrane  <cit> . a substantial part of tag synthesis is performed by enzymes of the kennedy pathway, which sequentially transfer acyl chains from acyl-coas to sn- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> positions of glycerol backbones  <cit> . dgat  is a transmembrane enzyme that functions in the final step of tag biosynthesis, catalyzing the acylation of sn- <dig> -diacylglycerol  at the sn- <dig> position using an acyl-coa substrate. dgat has been proposed to be the rate-limiting enzyme in plant storage lipid accumulation  <cit> . consequently, dgat is considered a key enzyme for biotechnological purposes; it might be utilized to increase oil content in oleaginous plant species  <cit> . dgat overexpression causes a net increase in seed oil content in arabidopsis  <cit> . additional evidence is also available from studies of glycine max  <cit> , brassica napus  <cit>  and zea mays  <cit> . tag can also be formed by an acyl-coa-independent pathway. in this pathway, the phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase  enzyme responsible for tag synthesis, using phosphatidylcholine  as the acyl donor, in which the transfer of an acyl group from the sn- <dig> position of pc to the sn- <dig> position of dag yields tag and sn- <dig> lyso-pc  <cit> .

different types of dgat enzymes have been identified in several species. dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> are two of the enzymes that are responsible for the main part of tag synthesis in most organisms, and they have been studied in many eukaryotic organisms. another group of dgat enzymes is represented by the bifunctional dgat/wax ester synthase  from acinetobacter calcoaceticus  <cit> . homologs of adp <dig> have also been characterized in petunia  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . a soluble form of dgat has been identified in peanut cotyledons  <cit> , and in euonymus alatus, a distinct type of dgat was recently identified that is responsible for the synthesis of 3-acetyl- <dig> -diacyl-sn-glycerols , an unusual triacylglycerol  <cit> . the first cloned dgat gene was isolated from mice; it corresponds to a member of the dgat <dig> family, which has high sequence similarity with the sterol:acyl-coa acyltransferase . dgat <dig> is structurally related to the acats, with the divergence in its amino acid sequence conferring its substrate specificity to dag. both enzymes belong to a large family of membrane-bound o-acyltransferases   <cit> . the dgat <dig> gene was initially identified in the oleaginous fungus morteriella ramanniana  <cit> . in addition to dgat <dig>  this family includes acyl-coa:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase- <dig> ec: <dig> . <dig>    <cit> , mgat <dig>  <cit> , mgat <dig>  <cit> , and acyl-coa wax-alcohol acyltransferase   <cit> . interestingly, dgat <dig> enzyme family members do not show dna or protein sequence similarities with dgat <dig>  furthermore, dgat <dig> proteins are larger than dgat <dig> and possess  <dig> to  <dig> transmembrane domains, while dgat <dig> has only one or two  <cit> . thus, it has been suggested that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> play non-redundant roles in different tissues and species in tag synthesis  <cit> . homologs of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes have been identified in several eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . a study of comparative genomics and proteomics in vertebrates suggested that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene families have evolved separately during vertebrate evolution  <cit> . despite many studies of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene families, which emphasize the importance of these enzymes in biotechnology for increasing the accumulation of triacylglycerols  <cit> , little is known about their evolutionary origins in eukaryotes apart from vertebrates.

the increasing availability of whole genome sequences and the annotation of genes from a wide range of phyla enable deeper phylogenetic analysis of gene families to provide important contextual insight into their present day diversity and evolution. the goal of this study was to examine the evolutionary relationship of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes across eukaryotic organisms in order to determine their origin and to verify if these genes evolved separately in eukaryotic organisms. we performed a comparative analysis integrating phylogenetic, computational and structural approaches to the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes, including analysis of their relationship with the acat, mgat and awat genes in a large number of fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes, representing a broad array of taxonomic groups. most genomes contain both the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes, though dgat <dig> is absent in yeast and basidiomycetes. our findings suggest that these two enzymes evolved separately since the emergence of eukaryotes and may have different origins.

methods
data sources and sequence retrieving
dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene and protein sequences were obtained by performing blast searches  of the protein and genome databases with the default parameters and an e-value threshold of  <dig>  e- <dig> at the ncbi  and the completed genome projects database at the jgi . the cdna sequences encoding dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> from arabidopsis  were used as queries in the blastx and tblastx programs to search for dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> from different plant species. the predicted peptides were further used in blastp analysis to double check their predicted identities. the mouse dgat1- <dig> , acat1- <dig> , mgat1- <dig>  and awat1- <dig>  cdna sequences were used as queries in the blastx and blastp to search for homologous sequences. the genome databases of yeast http://www.yeastgenome.org/, fungi and insects http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ were also analyzed using a methodology similar to that described for the plant and vertebrate sequences. sequences from representative eukaryotic species belonging to plant monocotyledons , eudicots , mosses , microalgae , mammals , bird , amphibian , fish , invertebrates , yeast , fungi  and amoebozoa  were selected. additional file  <dig> provides a detailed description of the proteins used and the corresponding accession numbers. taxa terminologies are abbreviated using the first letter of the genus and two letters of the species name .

sequence alignments
nucleotide and protein sequences were aligned using the alignment explorer/clustalw  <cit>  implemented in molecular evolutionary genetics analysis   <cit> . the multiple alignments were manually inspected and edited, and only positions unambiguously aligned were included in the final analysis. the final dataset included a total of  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species and  <dig> amino acid positions. because the dgat <dig> gene was first identified in the oleaginous fungus morteriella ramanniana  <cit> , we also included these sequences in the analysis. in tropaeolun majus, dgat <dig> seems to be the sole acyl-coa-dependent dgat  <cit> , and this sequence was included in the analysis. we also included in this dataset sequences of other types of dgat enzymes to compare with dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  such as the wsd protein sequence from arabidopsis  <cit>  and acinetobacter sp.  <cit> , soluble dgat from arachis hypogaea  <cit>  and a distinct dgat  from euonimus alatus  <cit> .

phylogenetic and structural analyses
the phylogenetic analysis was reconstructed after protein sequence alignments using three different and independent approaches: the neighbor-joining , the bayesian and the maximum-likelihood  methods. the nj method was performed with mega  <dig>   <cit> . the molecular distances of the aligned sequences were calculated according to the poisson correction model. all gap and missing data in the alignments were accounted for by pairwise deletion. branch points were tested for significance by bootstrapping with  <dig> replications. the ml analysis was performed using phyml <dig>   <cit> . branch points were tested for significance by bootstrapping with  <dig> replicates. bayesian analysis was conducted in mrbayes  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with the mixed amino acid substitution model plus gamma and invariant sites. two independent runs of  <dig> , <dig> generations each with two metropolis-coupled monte carlo markov chains  were run in parallel . markov chains were sampled every  <dig> generations, and the first 25% of the trees were discarded as burn-in. the remaining ones were used to compute the majority rule consensus tree , the posterior probability of clades and branch lengths. convergence of the two runs was assessed by checking the average standard deviation of split frequencies  and the potential scale reduction factor .

the structural organization of the dgat genes was determined after alignment of genomic dna and cdna and est sequences. genomic sequences were also analyzed in the fgenesh gene structure prediction program http://www.softberry.com/ <cit> . predicted transmembrane structures were obtained using the transmembrane prediction server tmhmm- <dig>  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ and smart database http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ with the complete protein sequences.

divergence estimates
pairwise synonymous  and non-synonymous  numbers of substitutions corrected for multiple hits were calculated using the dnasp software   <cit> .

cloning and yeast complementation
leaves from castor bean  two month-old plants were used for total rna extraction using the nucleospin rna plant kit  following the manufacturer's instructions. first strand cdna synthesis was performed with oligo primers and m-mlv reverse transcriptase . the complete open reading frames from castor rcdgat <dig>  and rcdgat <dig>  genes were amplified using pfx <dig> polymerase  with the following primers: 5'-cacctctagaatgacgattctcgaaacgcc-3' and 5'-ctcgagtcagttcccatcgcgattcatt- <dig> for rcdgat <dig> and 5'-cacctctagaatgggggaagaagcgaatca-3' and 5'-ctcgagtcaaagaatttcaagtgtaaggtctgc-3' for rcdgat <dig>  xbai and xhoi sites added for subsequent manipulations are underlined. the resulting blunt ended pcr fragments were cloned into pentr/d-topo  following the manufacturer's instructions. for complementation experiments in yeast, the cloned cdna fragments were transferred to pvt103-u  <cit>  as xbai/xhoi inserts, and the following resulting plasmids were introduced into yeast  strains  <cit> : are <dig> are <dig> mutant , and a quadruple mutant strain are <dig> are <dig> lro <dig> dga <dig> .

yeast growth and lipid analysis
single colonies of vector-only, rcdgat <dig> or rcdgat <dig> transformed yeast in the h <dig> and h <dig> mutant backgrounds were inoculated in  <dig> ml of synthetic complete medium with ura omitted and grown for  <dig> h at 28°c. cultures were centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig>  g. cell pellets were twice extracted with  <dig>  ml of chloroform-methanol solution  after intense agitation for  <dig> min with  <dig>  mm glass-beads. the chloroform phase was collected and evaporated under n <dig> flow at room temperature. lipids were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography  on silica-gel  <dig>  using the hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid  solvent system, which is specific for resolving neutral lipids  <cit> . lipids were revealed after staining with a  <dig> % solution of coomassie brilliant blue r <dig>  in 20% methanol  <cit> . triolein, cholesterol and cholesterol-ester reference lipids, used for tlc, were all obtained from sigma.

RESULTS
identification of dgat homologous sequences
we have conducted a broad survey of fully sequenced genomes, including representatives of amoebozoa, yeasts, fungi algae, mosses, plants , vertebrate  and invertebrate , for the presence of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene homologs. the full list of genes resulting from this analysis is summarized in additional file  <dig>  a set of  <dig> completely sequenced and  <dig> non-sequenced genomes were investigated. a total of  <dig> sequences were identified, of which  <dig> were dgats ,  <dig> corresponded to acat, mgat and awat and the remaining were sequences of other types of dgats. these other dgat types include a soluble dgat from peanut, a distinct dgat  from euonymus alatus and a bifunctional dgat/wax synthase  from a. thaliana and acinetobacter sp.

it was verified that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes are almost ubiquitously found in eukaryotes, being readily identifiable in all the major eukaryotic groups and in all genomes examined with the notable exception of yeast  and basidiomycetes fungi , which do not contain a dgat <dig> gene. most organisms possess a single copy of each dgat gene. the remarkable exception to this general pattern occurs in some members of green plants, revealing the possible existence of lineage-specific duplications. homologs to acat genes were found in yeast, fungi, vertebrates  and invertebrates  but not in plants. the mgat and awat genes were found only in vertebrate taxa. in amoebozoa species , four putative dgat sequences were identified.

evolutionary relationship of the dgat gene family in eukaryotes
the  <dig> eukaryote dgat amino acid sequences and related acat, mgat and awat enzymes were used for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. a total of  <dig> positions were included in the final dataset. phylogenetic analyses of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> amino acid sequences resulted in a well-resolved tree. results from bayesian nj and ml tree analysis produced similar topologies and revealed evolutionary partitioning of the dgat protein family into two major clades: dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> . vertebrate and invertebrate acat1- <dig> and yeast and fungi are proteins grouped within the dgat <dig> clade . the mgat and awat protein grouped into the dgat <dig> clade. although the acat and dgat <dig> proteins are closely related in phylogenetic trees, the acat sequences from yeast, fungi, vertebrates and invertebrates clustered separately from dgat <dig> sequences. interestingly, dgat <dig> sequences from vertebrates do not form a monophyletic group with the dgat <dig> homolog sequences from yeast, fungi, invertebrates and plants. instead, the dgat <dig> sequences from vertebrates appear more closely related to the vertebrate mgat <dig> and awat clades, suggesting that these genes may have arisen from dgat <dig> duplication events. inside both dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> clades from plants, monocotyledons and eudicots grouped separately. two of the four dgats sequence homologs found in amoebozoa  grouped into the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> clade, respectively, suggesting that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> diverged very early in eukaryotic evolution. eadact , atsat , a soluble dgat from peanut and wsd from a. thaliana and acinetobacter sp. grouped separately from dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  but with low bootstrap and posteriori probability values. this result indicates that these types of dgat enzymes are phylogenetically divergent from dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  genes encoding eadact, sat, wsd and soluble dgat enzymes have not yet been identified in other organisms.

structural organization and transmembrane domain prediction
to further investigate the relationships between the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene families, we compared the structural organization of the dgat genes, when gene and corresponding cdna were available. comparisons were performed between dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes from plants and vertebrates . a detailed comparison of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes across plant species and vertebrates  revealed a high degree of conservation in gene structure within each type of dgat . however, the structure of the genes encoding the dgat <dig> protein is distinct from that of the dgat <dig> gene. the dgat <dig> genes harbor  <dig> to  <dig> exons, while dgat <dig> genes have  <dig> to  <dig> exons. in higher plants, dgat <dig> proteins are encoded by genes that are generally comprised of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . an exception to this pattern was observed for m. esculenta, which probably lost its 7th exon and has  <dig> exons. the dgat <dig> genes are generally comprised of  <dig> exons, with the exception of arabidopsis, which has  <dig>  the vertebrate acat has  <dig> exons, while mgat has  <dig> exons. another important finding was that the structures of the dgat <dig> and acat genes are more related to each other than to the structure of genes encoding dgat <dig>  which is more related to the mgat gene .

predictions of transmembrane  structures were performed, and comparisons were made between plant dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> and mouse dgat <dig>  dgat <dig>  acat, mgat and awat . for each plant dgat <dig> subunit examined,  <dig> and  <dig> regions containing highly probable trm sequences were predicted for monocotyledons and eudicots, respectively. for dgat <dig>  only  <dig> regions containing highly probable trm sequences were detected in both monocotyledons and eudicots . the comparisons among mouse dgat <dig>  dgat <dig>  acat, mgat and awat subunits revealed that dgat <dig> is more closely related to acat, which has  <dig> high probable trm regions, while dgat <dig> is more closely related to the mgat and awat proteins, with only  <dig> trm region. interestingly, s. cerevisae acyl-coa sterol acyltransferase  includes  <dig> trm regions, as found in plant dgat <dig> and in mouse dgat <dig> and acat. further, s. cereviceae dga <dig>  possesses only one trm region, as found in plant dgat <dig> and mouse dgat <dig>  mgat and awat . moreover, both acat and dgat <dig> proteins have an mboat  domain , while dgat <dig>  mgat and awat do not. these results support the hypothesis that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> belong to different gene families and evolved separately during eukaryote evolution, as is demonstrated by the phylogenetic tree. additional files  <dig> and  <dig> show the multiple sequence alignment of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> protein sequences, respectively. in these alignments, we observed similarities between dagt <dig> and acat and dgat <dig> with mgat and awat protein sequences.

divergence estimates
a comparison of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions  to the rate of synonymous substitutions  was performed; such comparison can be used as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a protein-coding gene  <cit> . we calculated ka/ksratios for vertebrate dgat <dig>  dgat <dig>  acat, mgat and awat and for plant dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  from these analyses it can be noted that distinct selective pressures have been operating on the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes, as different rates were obtained . comparisons between vertebrate dgat <dig> and acat showed high ka/ksratios, while low ka/ksratios were observed between dgat <dig> with mgat and awat from vertebrates . the comparisons between dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> in both vertebrates and plants revealed a high level of ka/ksratios . we also compared dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> between eudicots and monocots and between oilseed and no oilseed plants and verified low ka/ksratios, indicating that they are under purifying selection.

dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> and triacylglycerol biosynthesis
two different yeast mutants that are defective in tag biosynthesis were used to determine if both castor bean dgat orthologs are able to complement the mutated enzymes and allow the synthesis and accumulation of tag . tag synthesis was undetectable in both mutant strains h <dig>  and h <dig>  carrying the empty expression vector. only dgat <dig> was able to reestablish tag synthesis in the h <dig> strain and h <dig> yeast mutants. the equivalence of lipid amounts among samples was confirmed by the homogeneous amount of mono-alkyl-diacyl-glycerol.

discussion
it has long been understood that dgat enzymes play important roles in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. dgat is the only enzyme in the pathway that is thought to be exclusively committed to tag synthesis, and thus it is considered a key enzyme in this reaction  <cit> . dgat activity was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> , but it was only in the last decade that dgat genes were cloned and molecular tools for studying tg synthesis became available  <cit> . although many studies have been conducted with these enzymes, little is known about their evolutionary origins. taking advantage of the wide availability of data on the genomes of several species, this study focused on the characterization of the origin and evolutionary history of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene families in eukaryotes. our survey of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> proteins shows that they are present in all eukaryotes searched, with the exception of yeast  and basidiomycetes , which lack dgat <dig> . this demonstrates that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes encode essential enzymes for most eukaryotic organisms. in the yeast s. cereviseae, two genes that have homology with dgat <dig> were identified, are <dig> and are <dig>  which encode acat-related enzymes. the yeast enzymes are  <dig> percent identical to each other and exhibit  <dig> percent identity to human acat  <cit> . both these genes have been suggested to be involved in the synthesis of sterol esters. are <dig> is also involved in the synthesis of tag, whereas the are <dig> gene is more specifically involved in the synthesis of sterol esters  <cit> . insights into the functions of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> in triglyceride metabolism have been provided by studies in yeast. with gene knockout or overexpression studies, several groups have demonstrated that the yeast dga <dig> , is the major dgat enzyme contributing to triglyceride synthesis and storage in yeast  <cit> . however, it has been demonstrated with genetic complementation that dgat <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana can restore tag synthesis to the yeast dga1:lro1:are1:are <dig> quadruple mutant, which is devoid of tag and sterol esters  <cit> . in the present work, using the castor bean genes, we obtained similar results with dgat <dig>  and were also unable to demonstrate dgat <dig> ability to complement tag synthesis compared to dgat <dig>  as previously described by zhang and collaborator's using dgat <dig> from arabidopsis  <cit> . this indicates that despite their apparent convergent functional evolution, dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> have different affinities for identical substrates, and their effective activity with accumulation of tag depends on how much the other enzymes from the same pathway consume or provide dgat substrate and precursors. the absence of dgat <dig> genes in yeast and in basidiomycetes indicates that tgas are not essential in these organisms and that other enzymes may be able to produce the required amount of triacylglycerol. mutant s. cerevisiae strains devoid of dgat activity and lacking triglycerides are viable and grow normally, indicating that triglycerides are not essential for the survival of this yeast  <cit> . however, a recent study showed that triglyceride synthesis is essential for viability of the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> .

our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the existence of separate clades for dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes in eukaryotes, indicating that they evolved asymmetrically. in the phylogenetic analysis, dgat <dig> was more closely related and grouped with acat genes. acat is involved in cholesterol ester biosynthesis in mammals  <cit> , and homologs of these genes were found in fungi, insects and vertebrates but not in plants. we verified a conserved motif between dgat <dig> and acat  in all organisms analyzed that has also been reported in other studies  <cit> . this motif has been implicated in the binding of fatty acyl-coa, a common substrate for these enzymes  <cit> . additionally, dgat <dig> shares homology and groups with acyl-coa: monoacylglycerol acyltransferases  <cit> . topological studies indicated that the majority of dgat <dig> is composed of a c-terminal cytoplasmic domain. the amino acids hphg make up residues 161- <dig> of murine dgat <dig>  suggesting that this sequence plays a crucial role in the function of the enzyme and may be part of the active site  <cit> . the hphg-motif is conserved in dgat <dig> in yeast, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates and is also present in mgat and awat. plant dgat <dig> contains a corresponding sequence of conserved amino acids, but the motif is modified to ephsv , which is conserved in all plant species analyzed. three dgat <dig> homologs were found in the microalgae chlorella sp. . in nj and ml analysis, chrdgat2c is more related with vertebrate, invertebrate, fungi and yeast dgat <dig> members and also with the mgat and awat proteins. chrdgat2c has an hphg motif and chrdgat2a and chrdgat2b have ephsv motifs, similar to the plant dgat <dig>  the same pattern was found in two unicellular photoautotrophic green algae, ostreococcus tauri and o. lucimarinus, which have three dgat <dig> genes. one of them shows significant homology to mammalian mgat, whereas the other two seem to be more closely related to plant dgat <dig> members  <cit> . this suggests that dgat <dig> in these organisms may have evolved by different duplication events.

notably, the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> families arose from different ancestors during the emergence of eukaryotes, and our results suggest that they followed convergent evolution in eukaryotes despite having evolved separately since the early eukaryotes, as depicted in the model in figure  <dig>  the high sequence similarity and close phylogenetic relationship of the dgat <dig> and acat genes, which is higher than that of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  strongly suggests that dgat <dig> and acat emerged from a common ancestral sequence, whereas dgat <dig> emerged from another ancestral sequence. we propose that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes had a functional convergence in eukaryotes, which may be explained by the great importance of dgat activity to the formation of tags in all eukaryotes. in several species, the formation of tags plays important roles not only as a storage reserve but also in growth and development. in agreement with our findings, it has been proposed that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> enzymes have different biochemical properties and physiological functions. in overexpression studies in mice, dgat <dig> was identified as a more active enzyme than dgat <dig>  yielding a higher increase in intracellular triacylglycerols that accumulated as large, centrally located, cytosolic droplets  <cit> . mice lacking dgat <dig>  are viable and have modest reductions in tissue triacylglycerols  <cit> , whereas mice lacking dgat <dig>  have severe reductions in whole body triacylglycerols and die shortly after birth  <cit> . in a. thaliana, mutation of the dgat <dig> gene severely affects seed development, causing the appearance of wrinkled and incompletely filled seeds, aberrant seedling growth, reduced seed oil content, an increased dag/tag ratio and the beta-oxidation of elevated fatty acid  levels  <cit> . it has been also demonstrated that dgat <dig>  but not dgat <dig>  is a multifunctional acyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of diacylglycerol, retinyl esters, and waxes in addition to triacylglycerol in in vitro assays  <cit> . dgat <dig> cannot compensate for the absence of dgat <dig>  highlighting the functional differences between these enzymes. furthermore, compared to dgat <dig>  dgat <dig> appears to be more active at lower concentrations of acyl-coa  and less active at concentrations below  <dig> mm magnesium  <cit> . the two enzymes may also differ in terms of substrate specificities. substrate specificity assays using a mammalian dgat <dig> expressed in insect cells showed that oleoyl-coa was utilized preferentially, followed by palmitoyl-coa, while activity levels with linoleoyl- and arachidonyl-coa were similar  <cit> . however, in enzymatic assays using soluble and non-soluble samples of the fungal dgat <dig> from m. ramanniana, no significant preference was detected between 12:0-coa and 18:1-coa as an acyl donor substrate  <cit> . in plant species, although both dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> significantly contribute to tag formation, the relative contribution of each enzyme seems to be species dependent and may also differ in different tissues within the same plant species  <cit> . moreover, it was reported that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> are located in different areas of the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . the fatty acid profile of tag may be determined by distinct substrate specificities of the dgat enzymes in different species and in plants containing unusual fatty acids. dgat <dig> may have a major role in channeling unusual fatty acids into seed storage oils  <cit> . in a recent study with ricinus comunis, it was demonstrated that dgat <dig> presents higher mrna accumulation than dgat <dig> during castor seed development  <cit> . it was also demonstrated in r. comunis that only rcdgat <dig> can increase hydroxy fatty acid levels in transgenic arabidopsis, while rcdgat <dig> cannot  <cit> . dgat <dig> is more likely to play a major role in seed tag biosynthesis than dgat <dig> in this plant species  <cit> . in addition, a study of vernolic acid in vernonia galamensis concluded that both dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> increase epoxy fatty acid accumulations, but dgat <dig> had a greater effect  <cit> . all these findings corroborate with our results that show that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  despite being evolutionarily divergent enzymes, play important roles in tag metabolism in all eukaryotic organisms. therefore, we conclude that they are very ancient enzymes that arose quite early in eukaryotic evolution.

the same patterns were observed in structural and transmembrane analysis. the topology models based on prediction algorithms suggested that dgat <dig> and acat had eight transmembrane domains and 15- <dig> exons, whereas dgat <dig> had  <dig> or  <dig> transmembrane domains and  <dig> exons, similar to mgat and awat. this reinforced the idea that despite their ability to catalyze similar reactions, dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> belong to different gene families that share neither dna nor protein sequence similarity  <cit> . in addition, topological studies show that dgat <dig> has its n-terminus oriented towards the cytosol and c-terminal region, which accounts for approximately 50% of the protein, and is present in the er lumen  <cit> . conversely, dgat <dig> is an integral membrane protein with both the n and c termini oriented toward the cytosol  <cit> . in agreement with our results, a comparative genomics and proteomics study of vertebrate dgats revealed that the predicted secondary and transmembrane  structures of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> were distinct  <cit> . all of the dgat <dig> subunits had one or two predicted trm, whereas dgat <dig> was predicted to have nine regions with high probability for trm  <cit> . in contrast, a recent study about the membrane topology of murine dgat <dig> indicates that dgat <dig> has three transmembrane domains  <cit> . for murine dgat <dig>  two transmembrane domain were identified  <cit> . studies were also carried out in plants and have shown that helianthus annuus  <cit> , echium  <cit>  and brassica juncea  <cit>  have nine transmembrane domains in dgat <dig>  while dgat <dig> from brassica juncea have two transmembrane domains  <cit> .

the ka/ks ratios for vertebrate dgat <dig>  dgat <dig>  acat, mgat and awat and for plant dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> showed that distinct selective pressures have been operating on the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes. the comparisons between species groups within of each dagt <dig> and dagt <dig> family revealed high ka/ksratios, while low ka/ksratios were observed between the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> families. this indicates a purifying selection within each family with a strong positive selection between them. in the dgat <dig> and acat genes, in addition to a high level of similarity between them, a positive selection has taken place at multiple locations.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data show that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> proteins are present in most eukaryotic organisms as different gene families. phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses revealed that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> evolved separately with functional convergence since the emergence of eukaryotes and are widely divergent in molecular and structural aspects.
