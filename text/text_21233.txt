BACKGROUND
shigella species that cause bacillary dysentery or shigellosis are gram-negative, non-sporulating, facultative anaerobes, and the disease remains a major worldwide health problem. an estimated annual infection of  <dig> million individuals, with  <dig>  million deaths, most of them children under  <dig> years old in developing countries, occurs with shigellosis  <cit> . the poor sanitary conditions prevalent in these areas contribute to the spread of the bacteria, and the expense of antibiotics and increasing antibiotic resistance complicate treatment  <cit> .

shigella was recognized as the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery in the 1890s. it was adopted as a genus in the 1950s and sub-divided into  <dig> species: s. dysenteriae, s. flexneri, s. boydii and s. sonnei  <cit> . according to this taxonomy,s. flexneri is classified into  <dig> serotypes . most previous work on the molecular pathogenesis of shigella has been carried out in s. flexneri serotypes 2a and  <dig> 

in china, s. flexneri 2a is a hyperendemic species and is responsible for approximately 50â€“70% of > <dig> million cases per year, most of them associated with epidemic and pandemic shigellosis  <cit> . shigella pathologically invades the intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in an intense inflammatory reaction characterized by abscess formation and ulceration. all shigella strains contain a large virulence plasmid that is known to encode genes necessary and sufficient for invasion  <cit> . the virulence plasmid from s. flexneri serotype 2a diverges slightly from serotype 5a  <cit> , but the epidemicities of the two serotypes differ markedly. chromosomal genes present in "pathogenicity islands" usually participate in the pathogenic process directly, or contribute to survival in the host environments during infection  <cit> , and the expression of virulence depends on a complex regulation mechanism that involves dialog between the chromosome and the virulence plasmid  <cit> .

we and others have previously sequenced two genomes of the most prevalent species s. flexneri 2a  and also completed the genomes from the other three species of shigella  <cit> . all these genomes show that the extensive diversity of shigella is perhaps attributable to the fact that the bacteria evolved from different strains of e. coli and became highly specific human pathogens through convergent evolution. a better understanding of the intra-species diversity of shigella requires the availability of more whole genome sequences.

we present here the complete genome sequence of s. flexneri 5b sf <dig> and a comparison with the s. flexneri 2a sf <dig> genome, which reveals differences in the pathogenicity islands and chromosomal rearrangements between different serotypes of this species. the comparison will facilitate understanding of the common biological processes required for infection and identify unique properties that may differentiate between them in respect of epidemicity and pathogenicity, even if the virulence plasmid is closely similar. moreover, the comparison will provide some insight into how these pathogens have evolved.

RESULTS
general features
in common with other reported shigella strains, the genome of sf <dig> contains a circular chromosome. since the complete sequences of pwr <dig> and pwr <dig> are known  <cit> , we present here only the chromosome sequence, which is  <dig> , <dig> bp in length with an average gc content of  <dig> % and encodes  <dig> trna genes . its size is a little smaller than that of sf <dig>  mainly because shi- <dig> is absent . sf <dig> has  <dig> rrna operons, with  <dig> copies in one replichore and  <dig> in the other, while sf <dig> has  <dig> copies in one replichore and  <dig> in the other. these result from one intra-replichore inversion near the replication origin . comparison of sf <dig> with sf <dig> reveals that more than 97% of the genome sequence is shared between the two strains. the architecture of the sf <dig> genome is similar to sf <dig> but the overall colinearity is broken by  <dig> translocations and inversions involving dna segments > <dig> kb . among the  <dig> proteomes of mg <dig>   <dig> proteins  are shared by sf <dig> and sf <dig> and may be regarded as the "backbone" of s. flexneri , while  <dig> are pseudogenes in both genomes. two hundred and sixty-six of the  <dig> non-backbone proteins were predicted to be metabolism-related by the clusters of orthologous groups  database. this reflects the evolution of s. flexneri from a non-pathogenic e. coli ancestor to a facultative intracellular pathogen. among the  <dig> sf <dig> specific proteins  only  <dig> are specific to all known shigella genomes; most of them are bacteriophage-related proteins or hypothetical proteins .

is elements are ubiquitous in bacterial genomes and important factors in evolution  <cit> . the is insertion can cause gene inactivation, activate cryptic genes or alter the expression of adjacent genes  <cit> . the numbers and species of is elements in the sf <dig> genome are similar to previously-determined shigella genomes. in total, the is elements encode  <dig> orfs and make up  <dig> %  of the chromosome, and the predominant species is is <dig>  a distinct difference is that sf <dig> has  <dig> copies of iso-is10r, while sf <dig> and other sequenced shigella chromosomes have not. this might be used as a marker for epidemiological studies. furthermore, is elements are capable of causing various genetic rearrangements such as deletions, inversions and translocations  <cit> . unlike the inversion reported in yersinia pestis  <cit> , s. enterica serovar typhi  <cit>  and e. coli k- <dig> strain w <dig>  <cit> , which are associated with rrna homologies, inversions in sf <dig> are probably mediated by is elements. inversions  <dig> and  <dig>  occur around shi-o and shi- <dig>  which are mediated by is <dig> and is <dig>  besides these major inversions, there are other four inverted regions, inversions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , which are probably mediated by is <dig>  issfl <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> respectively.

diversity of shi-o
lps is an important virulence factor in shigella  <cit> . since the immune response to shigella spp. is o-antigen specific, an immune response to a specific o antigen does not protect against infection with other serotypes. therefore, the capacity to alter serotypes may be advantageous for shigella spp. in the infectious process  <cit> . in sf <dig>  the serotype conversion region, i.e. shi-o  <cit> , is located around  <dig> kb . in shi-o the  <dig> genes termed gtra, gtrb and gtrv  are putatively involved in glucosylation reactions  <cit> . the mean gc content of gtra and gtrb is  <dig> %, and the gc content of gtrv is  <dig> %. all three are lower than the whole genome gc content . compared with sf <dig>  gtra and gtrb are highly conserved and interchangeable among serotypes, whereas gtr  appears to be unique to each bacteriophage  <cit> , which indicates that these genes have been acquired from lysogeny caused by bacteriophages.

the shi-o component differs between sf <dig> and sf <dig> . although type ii antigen is encoded by an inducible bacteriophage, sfii  <cit> , little genomic sequence of bacteriophage sfii remains in the shi-o of 2457t and sf <dig> except the key genes related to antigenic variation  <cit> . however, the sf <dig> shi-o includes not only the type v antigen gene, which comes from bacteriophage sfv, but also another  <dig> kb segment of bacteriophage sfv  <cit> .

temperate bacteriophages of s. flexneri play an important role in serotype conversion. bacteriophages sfv and sfii encode the factors involved in glucosylation of the o-antigen, and lysogenization results in conversion of serotype y strains to serotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the defining point for evolution of s. flexneri  <dig> and  <dig> from the s. flexneri ancestor is probably the acquisition of the precursor of the current-day o-antigen modification genes. it can be supposed that the s. flexneri ancestor acquired diverse o-antigen modification genes along with related bacteriophage sequences when the bacteriophages were integrated into the bacterial genomes. the genome rearrangements caused by is elements in far-flung evolutional processes have interrupted these bacteriophage sequences in many shigella genomes. however, there are ~ <dig> kb of bacteriophage sfv sequence remnants in sf <dig>  though far less bacteriophage sfii sequence has remained in sf <dig>  this might be because the sf <dig> genome is less dynamic than that of sf <dig>  or alternatively, it may suggest that sf <dig> arose later than sf <dig>  this hypothesis requires further investigation.

absence of shi-1
shigella pathogenicity island shi- <dig> encodes three characterized proteins: siga, pic and the enterotoxin shet <dig>  functional analysis shows that siga is cytopathic for hep- <dig> cells and at least partly responsible for the ability of s. flexneri to stimulate fluid accumulation in ligated rabbit ileal loops  <cit> . the pic protein, a serine protease, is involved in mucinase activity, serum resistance and hemagglutination  <cit> . furthermore, shet <dig> encoded by set1a and set1b could increase fluid accumulation in the rabbit loop model.

shi- <dig> is located directly downstream of the phev trna gene and includes an imperfect repeat of the 3'-end  <dig> bp of the phev gene at the right boundary in sf <dig> . studies of shi- <dig> distribution  show that intact shi- <dig> is present in all tested serotype 2a strains of s. flexneri but absent from some s. flexneri serotype strains such as 1a, 1b, 3b,  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising that shi- <dig> is wholly absent from sf <dig>  however, the homolog of sf <dig>  a hypothetical protein located downstream of shi- <dig> in sf <dig>  is situated next to the phev gene in sf <dig> . further investigation shows that the homolog of sf <dig> is only present adjacent to shi- <dig> in the sf <dig> and 2457t genomes and the s. flexneri 2a she pathogenicity island  <cit> . so the presence of sfv <dig> suggests that sf <dig> might have contained shi- <dig> during its evolutionary history but lost it for unknown reasons. sakellaris et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the spontaneous and precise excision of shi- <dig> can occur via recombination between a  <dig> bp sequence at the 3' terminus of phev and an imperfect direct repeat at the phev-distal boundary of the shi- <dig>  thus, we have probably witnessed the case in sf <dig>  undoubtedly, the mechanism by which shi- <dig> is stabilized in s. flexneri 2a strains will be an interesting focus for further studies.

inversion of shi-2
shi- <dig> encodes the synthesis and transport of aerobactin, a hydroxamate siderophore associated with increased virulence in enteric bacteria  <cit> , and is located downstream of the selc trna gene in sf <dig>  the conservation of the component, organization and integration site of shi- <dig> in sf <dig> and sf <dig> implies that it was acquired by the s. flexneri ancestor before the serotypes diverged. however, the iut/iuc operon is located on the leading strand and on the counter-clockwise site of the replication origin in sf <dig>  but on the lagging strand and on the clockwise site in sf <dig> . our previous genome studies revealed that shi- <dig> in s. sonnei ss <dig> was unlinked with the selc gene by an inversion, and shi- <dig> of s. boydii sb <dig> that carries a similar iut/iuc operon is linked with the pheu trna locus  <cit> . so in view of this information, the observation that the iut/iuc operon can inserted into a variety of different loci suggests that it is highly mobile and may be acquired by additional human or animal pathogens  <cit> .

in sf <dig>  shi- <dig> is involved in inversion  <dig> that spans oric . all sequenced shigella chromosomes have inversions at oric and terc, which is suggested to be a common evolutionary feature of bacterial genomes  <cit> . in contrast to sf <dig>  inversion  <dig> is found from  <dig> to  <dig> kb in sf <dig>  which appears to be mediated by the boundary is <dig> copies in sf <dig> . however, the ~ <dig> kb center region of inversion  <dig> that covers oric retains colinearity with that of sf <dig> . since this region is sandwiched between two copies of is <dig>  it implies that two or more inversions have occurred: an inversion was followed by a re-inversion to restore colinearity.

inversions can produce an "x" shape, which changes the positions of these sequences from their natural locations  <cit> , and the distance from the iut/iuc operon to oric in sf <dig> is different from that in sf <dig> due to inversion  <dig> and the internal re-inversion mentioned above. owing to bidirectional replication, there are extra copies of genes close to oric, resulting in increased gene expression  <cit> , and since dosage differences may cause the strengths of promoters to be evolutionarily optimized for their specific positions, cells in which genes are a different distance from oric are at a selective disadvantage  <cit> . hence, whether the change in position of the iut/iuc operon in sf <dig> has any influence on expression needs to be determined.

differences among genes correlated with metabolism
the e. coli bet gene cluster  contributes to the pathway for glycine-betaine biosynthesis from choline  <cit>  and is located close to shi-o in sf <dig> but absent from sf <dig> and 2457t. among eubacteria-compatible solutes, the most widespread is glycine-betaine, and this is the only osmoprotectant synthesized by e. coli  <cit> . the choline-glycine-betaine pathway confers a high level of osmotic tolerance on e. coli  <cit> . whether this system offers an advantage to s. flexneri 5b for environmental survival over s. flexneri 2a or plays a role during infection requires further investigation. however, the inversion around the shi-o may contribute to the deletion of the bet operon from s. flexneri 2a .

there are some differences in metabolic and physiological pathways between sf <dig> and sf <dig>  in both strains, some key metabolic pathways were inactivated by the creation of independent pseudogenes. for instance, the loss of ability to utilize d-sorbitol is due to the inactive states of srle and srla in sf <dig> and sf <dig>  respectively. it seems that shigella strains have a general tendency to lose some pathways and functions, and this tendency has given rise to convergent evolution  <cit> . the microorganisms need to adapt to new niches by adopting a strictly pathogenic life-style. there must be some genes that provide little overall selective benefit in a new situation. these genes will be eliminated through mutational bias favoring deletions for the lack of selective force to maintain them  <cit> . such functions, no longer active in one serotype but expressed in another, may lead to a better understanding of the diversity of the two serotypes and the evolution of s. flexneri.

CONCLUSIONS
as more bacterial genomes have been sequenced during recent years, the study of comparative genomics has progressed rapidly. although five shigella genomes have been reported, this is the first time that intra-species diversity has been characterized by comparing the genomes of two different serotypes of the same shigella species. the comparison between sf <dig> and sf <dig> has provided abundant biological and medical information.

the overall genomic organization, gene order and predicted proteomes of the two genomes are very similar, which suggests a high level of structural and functional conservation between the serotypes. nevertheless, the colinearity of genome structure between these two serotypes was disrupted by several inversions, and along with the differences found in the known pais, these may contribute to differences in epidemicity and virulence between s. flexneri 5b and s. flexneri 2a.

s. flexneri 5b and s. flexneri 2a have experienced different selection pressures and evolutionary processes. these events  have led to the diversity of shi-o, the absence of shi- <dig>  the shift of shi- <dig>  and other differences between these two genomes. they have extensively reshaped the genome, presumably virulence to be more fully expressed. it can be supposed that the s. flexneri ancestor had acquired shi- <dig> and shi- <dig> before divergence, and diverged into different serotypes after the different shi-os were integrated. subsequently, s. flexneri 5b deleted shi- <dig> via recombination and changed the structure of shi- <dig> by inversions, but s. flexneri 2a stabilized shi- <dig> in its genome. mechanisms not yet identified have helped to shape the differences between serotypes and led to the derivation of different serotypes from the same parental s. flexneri form. characterizing the divergence between serotypes at the genetic level helps us to understand the evolution of s. flexneri. the interplay between organizing features of the chromosome, such as the pathogenicity and the elements inducing sequence variation and chromosomal rearrangements, may provide an explanation of why different genomes show such different levels of organization and how this relates to their evolutionary history and ecology.

in conclusion, by comparing the genomes of sf <dig> and sf <dig>  a large amount of data has been obtained. it is important in biological and medical research to compare genomes causing similar types of diseases in the same subspecies but different serotypes. the identification of shared traits is important for pathogenicity and for the study of its conservation, transfer, epidemiology, virulence and evolution. although it is not clear at present whether these similarities and differences are common among s. flexneri, there is a possibility that such events lead to differences in virulence and pathogenicity. future studies should identify which of the differences in these genomes accounts for the phenotypic differences.
