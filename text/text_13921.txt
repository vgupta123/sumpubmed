BACKGROUND
the capacity of highly fecund mouse strains to successfully reproduce is accompanied by a concomitant increase in maternal performance at sustainable litter sizes  <cit> . the increase in lactation demanded by larger litters can be met by a combination of physiological strategies that allow for enhanced mammary development, increased milk output and improved milk nutritional quality. the mechanisms that underpin these strategies are complex and are under the control of multiple regulatory pathways that may each contribute at various levels. an effective way to analyse these mechanisms is to identify key genes or regulatory pathways that influence lactation phenotype. recently, functional genomic approaches have been successfully employed to identify genes that have altered expression during mammary gland development and initiation of secretion. as a result numerous gene candidates have been implicated during different stages of the lactation cycle with some mapped to distinct signalling pathways  <cit> .

a complementary approach involves the comparison of mouse strains that have divergent phenotypes, in particular strains that are representative of the high and low extremes of the variation that exists in the mouse population. the qsi <dig> inbred strain of mice was established from an outbred quackenbush-swiss strain by full-sib inbreeding and selection on the basis of increased litter size and shortened inter-litter interval  <cit> . the strain has an average litter size greater than  <dig> pups, and females commonly nurse up to  <dig> pups with greater than 90% survival to weaning. along with an increased body weight , these traits are indicative of enhanced lactation capacity  <cit> . indeed lactation performance, assessed by a weigh-suckle-weigh method, was 3-fold greater in qsi <dig> mice than in the cba strain  <cit> .

in this study, we utilised the divergent phenotypes of qsi <dig> and cba/cah  mice to identify genes and associated pathways that correspond to enhanced mammary gland capacity. we identified a significant enrichment among the differentially expressed genes in the wnt and mapk signalling pathways, both of which are implicated as effectors of ductal side-branching during mammary gland development  <cit> , and a finding that is consistent with anatomical differences found in the two strains. we also identified favourable expression patterns of genes in the tight junction pathway, and four imprinted genes that influence maternal performance in mice. we propose that the action of these signalling pathways and the effects of gene imprinting contribute to the superior maternal performance in the qsi <dig> strain.

RESULTS
maternal performance
we compared a highly fecund qsi <dig> inbred strain of mice to a non-selected cba strain of mice raised on a similar genetic background for reproductive performance. the number of pups born alive  in the first and second parities respectively for qsi <dig> mice was  <dig>  and  <dig>  pups/litter, whereas for the cba strain it was  <dig>  and  <dig>  pups/litter . thus significant differences in fecundity exist between qsi <dig> and cba strains of mice both in first and second parities .

to determine whether the increased maternal performance of qsi <dig> mice was independent of litter size we adjusted litter sizes on day of parturition for both the qsi <dig> and cba strains, and calculated cumulative weights for a standardized six pup litter. on this basis, significant strain-specific differences in maternal performance  were observed throughout the first eight days of lactation based on the cumulative litter weight . additionally, maternal performance assessed by individual pup growth rate was 150% greater  in qsi <dig> mice when compared to cba mice . further, there was no significant difference in pup growth rate between first and second parities within each strains. these results confirm that the superior maternal performance of the qsi <dig> mice was independent of the large litter size phenotype, and that significant differences in maternal performance exist between the qsi <dig> and cba inbred strains of mice.

morphometric analysis
to ascertain whether the strain-specific differences in maternal performance can be attributed to anatomical differences in the mammary gland during development, morphometric analysis of mammary whole mounts from mice at pregnancy day  <dig> . when adjusted for body weight, a significant difference in relative mammary gland weight existed between the two strains , calculated as 150% higher in the qsi <dig> strain relative to the cba strain of mice . quantitation of ductal density in mammary gland whole mounts using image analysis software  revealed a significant difference in the proportion of ductal branching between the two strains of mice  . ductal branching was approximately 150% higher in the qsi <dig> strain relative to the cba strain. similarly, relative quantitation of the terminal end buds  as an estimate of alveolar epithelial density showed a 140% increase in qsi <dig> mice compared to the cba strain of mice . thus, the qsi <dig> mice had both a greater mammary tissue mass and enhanced ductal side-branching; both consistent with a superior lactation phenotype.

mammary gene expression profiling
gene expression profiling of mammary gland tissue is an effective approach to identifying pathways that are active during mammary gland development and lactation. to identify the genes associated with the enhanced maternal performance phenotype of the qsi <dig> strain, gene expression profiles of mammary gland tissue from five animals each of lactating qsi <dig> and cba mice were compared. lactation day  <dig> was chosen for quantitative measurement because neonatal growth is a better correlate of lactation performance during the plateau phase of milk production in mice, that is at 6– <dig> days post-partum  <cit> . further, measurements on day  <dig> were comparable to other lactation cycle studies performed in mice  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> probesets  and  <dig> probesets  using a permutation based fdr of  <dig> %, and bh fdr of 5% respectively, as being differentially expressed between the two strains of mice. gene ontology classification of the differentially expressed genes based on molecular function identified the dominant categories, including calcium ion-binding and kinase activity, to be significantly over-represented among the differentially expressed genes . the genes identified in the calcium ion-binding category, included some well-characterised genes associated with lactation, such as lactalbumin , egf, phospholipase c, epsilon  <dig> , annexins in addition to phospholipid scramblase  <dig> , phospholipase a <dig>  group xiia  and nucleobindins . similarly, a number of known kinases associated with mammary gland development, including nemo like kinase , casein kinase , ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase, polypeptide  <dig> , and proviral integration site  <dig> &  <dig> kinases . importantly, positive mediators of mammary gland development such as lalba, egf, csnk1a <dig>  rps6kb <dig>  pim <dig> all had higher levels of expression in the qsi <dig> mice relative to the cba mice.

gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes based on the biological process category did not reveal any significant enrichment of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. subsequently, analysis of  <dig> genes corresponding to enzymes known to be involved in these metabolic processes  <cit>  identified agpat <dig> as the only gene to be differentially expressed.

pathway classification of the differentially expressed genes using the onto-express pathway analysis tool identified  <dig> genes in the mapk signalling pathway,  <dig> genes in the tight junction signalling pathway and  <dig> genes each from the wnt signalling pathway, cell adhesion molecules and insulin signalling pathways, as enriched among the differentially expressed genes . similar pathway analysis results were obtained when a group of  <dig> differentially expressed genes selected below a 5% fdr cut-off were analysed, and additionally included adherens, junction and tgf-beta signalling pathways. we also examined whether the differentially expressed genes in these pathways were associated with any of the mammary gland associated phenotypes found in the mouse genome informatics  database. ten of the  <dig> genes in these pathways were associated with postnatal growth retardation or postnatal lethality, which is substantially influenced by maternal/lactation performance. this included seven genes, namely egf, cdc <dig>  nlk, jund <dig>  kras, casp <dig> and map3k <dig>  from the mapk signalling pathway, a pathway that plays a critical role in mammary gland development via the egfr response. additionally, two genes that are associated with abnormal mammary gland development when deleted, egf and neo <dig>  were both over-expressed in the qsi <dig> mice. besides the ten unique wnt signalling pathway genes identified in the above pathway analysis, five other genes closely associated with the canonical wnt/β-catenin/tcf pathway, namely dkkl <dig>  muc <dig>  rps6kb <dig>  sdc  <dig> and sdc  <dig>  were also differentially expressed between the two mouse strains. the wnt pathway plays a significant role in initiation of mammary gland morphogenesis. wnts are secreted glycoproteins which stabilize β-catenin by preventing its degradation by the pp2a-gsk3β-axin complex, resulting in translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus where it activates downstream target genes. further, all positive mediators of the canonical wnt-β-catenin signalling pathway in this group, such as csnk1a <dig>  csnk2a <dig>  smad  <dig>  were over-represented, while negative regulators, including ppp2r1a, cdh <dig> and nlk, were under-represented in the qsi <dig> mice relative to cba mice .

amongst the  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the significantly enriched tight junction signalling pathway, seven and five genes were over- and under-represented respectively, in the qsi <dig> mice relative to cba mice. genes that play an important role in tight junction stability, including tjp <dig>  csnk2a <dig>  pard6g , llgl <dig> , were all over-represented in the high lactation performance qsi <dig> mice, whereas genes associated with tight junction permeability, namely ppp2r1a  and rhoa, were over-represented in the low performance cba mice. thus the decreased tight junction permeability of the qsi <dig> mice may contribute to enhanced milk secretion. also, amongst seven strain-specific differentially expressed genes in the tgf-β pathway,tgfb <dig> and rhoa, both negative regulators of mammary gland development, were over-represented in the low performance cba mice relative to the qsi <dig> mice. however, despite over-representation in the gene ontology analysis, when genes belonging to the insulin pathway were examined there was insufficient evidence to conclude that a pattern of expression between the two strains reflected lactation performance.

imprinted genes play a crucial role in facilitating transfer of nutrients from the mother to the offspring. analysis of the differentially expressed genes identified four imprinted genes . the paternally expressed genes, peg <dig> and plagl <dig>  that are both growth promoting, were over-represented in the qsi <dig> strain relative to the cba strain of mice. conversely, two maternally expressed genes that are pup-growth limiting, grb <dig> and igf2r, were over-represented in the cba mice.

the expression patterns of  <dig> milk protein genes previously identified as being differentially expressed in the mammary gland during the lactation cycle were also examined  <cit> . five of these genes, namely xdh, muc <dig>  lalba, egf, and csn1s2a, were differentially expressed between the two strains and all were over-represented in the high lactation performance qsi <dig> mice. one other pathway known to be associated with mammary development and lactation, the prolactin receptor pathway was also examined. key prolactin receptor-stat <dig> signalling pathway encoding genes, such as sta5a, stat5b, prl, prlr, jak <dig>  jak <dig>  or socs <dig>  were not differentially expressed between the two strains. however, amongst the  <dig> stat <dig> target genes identified in mammary epithelial cells  <cit> , three genes, socs <dig>  pim <dig> and grb <dig>  were differentially expressed. of these grb <dig> was over-represented in the cba mice whereas the other two genes were over-represented in qsi <dig> mice.

thus, differential expression of components of the tight junction, wnt and mapk signalling pathways together with favourable genomic imprinting may contribute to the increased maternal performance phenotype of the qsi <dig> strain of mice.

quantitative rt-pcr
quantitative rt-pcr  was used to evaluate the expression profiles of eight genes, including five genes identified as differentially expressed between the two strains on by microarray. in addition, wnt <dig> was selected for validation as it was identified as differentially expressed based on the analysis of a subset of the data, and both c-myc and cyclind <dig>  were examined as potential target genes of wnt signalling pathways. a significant degree of concordance, approximately 74%  was observed between the two methods based on the expression patterns for all genes examined . six of the eight genes examined, namely kif5b, ptger <dig>  grb <dig>  tnc and dkkl <dig>  were differentially expressed between the two strains. differential expression was not detected for the remaining two genes, c-myc and ccnd <dig>  but these genes are tightly regulated and are perhaps transiently expressed during stages of the cell cycle . thus, the results of the qrt-pcr analysis generally supported those of the microarray data analysis.

comparison between array experiment and real-time pcr for  <dig> selected genes is shown. log-fold change in real-time pcr was calculated from the difference in normalised expression between the cba and qsi <dig> strains of mice. p-value was calculated from 2-tailed student's t-test.

discussion
highly fecund mice provide an opportunity to investigate the factors that control maternal performance. comparison of the two phenotypically divergent inbred mouse strains, qsi <dig> and cba, identified genes associated with maternal performance. histological analysis of mammary whole mounts during mid-pregnancy revealed that qsi <dig> mice have increased ductal branching relative to the cba strain of mice. strain-specific differences in mammary gland architecture have been recognised for many years and may be regarded as a correlate of reproductive capacity. the differences may be due to epithelial factors  <cit> , stromal factors  <cit> , or hormonal factors  <cit> . mammary gland recombination and transplantation experiments using mice from strains with highly branched architecture, the  <dig> and c57bl/6j strains, which have a much lower level of side-branching, revealed that stromal factors were a likely source of variation  <cit> , but differential expression of stromal genes has been difficult to demonstrate  <cit> . in the present study, a comparative analysis of gene expression in qsi <dig> and cba mice identified candidate genes in a number of pathways, including tight junction, mapk and wnt signalling pathways, as contributors to the superior maternal performance phenotype of the qsi <dig> strain. additionally, four imprinted genes that have a role in neonatal growth and mammary development, were identified as candidate genes that may also contribute to the phenotype.

transcript profiling of mammary gland tissue from the two divergent strains during peak lactation revealed that wnt signalling pathway genes were enriched within the differentially expressed genes. wnt  genes are a family of secreted glycoproteins which commonly act through the canonical wnt/β-catenin/tcf signal transduction pathway both in embryonic and postnatal mammary gland development  <cit> . wnt genes, especially wnt <dig>  wnt5b and wnt <dig>  are progesterone responsive and are expressed in a temporal pattern during pregnancy and lactation  <cit> . wnt <dig> over-expression in virgin mice results in excessive ductal branching  <cit> , while gene deletion reduces ductal side branching in mammary glands at pregnancy day  <dig>  <cit> . there is also evidence that different wnt genes switch on or off at different stages of the lactation cycle  <cit> . the primary mode of action of the canonical wnt signalling pathway is the stabilisation of β-catenin  <cit> , which is necessary for normal lobular development of the mammary gland  <cit> . csnk1a <dig> and csnk2a <dig>  which were over-represented in qsi <dig> mice gene expression profiles, are positive mediators of the pathway, while a lower level of expression was seen for ppp2r1a, which has a central role in the β-catenin degradation complex.  <cit> . thus, stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin may provide a mechanism to enhance lobuloalveolar development in the qsi <dig> strain of mice.

postnatal growth of pups during the first two weeks is a key indicator of the lactation capacity of the dam. more than ten genes associated with this trait were identified amongst the enriched pathways. this included six genes of the mapk pathway, namely egf, cdc <dig>  nlk, jund <dig>  kras and map3k <dig>  which is activated during mammary gland development through the egf receptor. exogenous administration of egfr ligands reinitiated ductal outgrowth during puberty in both ovariectomized mice  <cit>  and er-α knock out mice  <cit> . a role for the egfr pathway in ductal development has been demonstrated by the phenotype observed in mice that have a functionally defective pathway  <cit> . there is also evidence that wnts activate egfr in murine mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . this is consistent with the findings of the present study, in which a relative enrichment of genes involved in both mapk and wnt signalling pathways was observed in qsi <dig> mice.

decreased tight junction permeability results in enhanced milk secretion  <cit> . the significant enrichment of genes from the tight junction signalling pathway amongst those differentially expressed in the present study suggests that the pathway may play a role in the lactation performance differences between the two strains of mice. positive mediators of the pathway include tjp <dig> and csnk2a, <dig>  are involved inclaudin polymerisation and tight junction formation  <cit> , and were over-represented in the qsi <dig> mice. corresponding to this was a relative decreased expression of the negative mediators of this pathway, namely rhoa and ppp2r1a. inhibition of rhoa is required for tight junction formation in rat mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . thus the potential for decreased tight junction permeability in qsi <dig> mice may contribute to enhanced milk secretion.

imprinted genes play a critical role both in prenatal and postnatal growth, the latter being mainly influenced by the maternal performance of the dam. according to the "parent-offspring conflict hypothesis" paternally expressed imprinted genes favour the growth of its offspring and facilitates maximum transfer of nutrients from the mother, whereas maternally expressed imprinted genes inhibit growth and favour equal allocation of resources  <cit> . this hypothesis holds true even for the postnatal growth of offspring prior to weaning for most of the imprinted genes that have been identified in mammals  <cit> . in the present study, both the paternally-expressed imprinted genes, peg <dig> and plagl <dig>  were over-represented in the superior performing qsi <dig> strain of mice whereas both the maternally-expressed imprinted genes, grb <dig> and igf2r, were under-represented. previously it has been reported that pups raised on peg <dig> deficient mice have reduced growth rate compared to their wild-type litter mates due to poor maternal care and impaired milk release  <cit> . peg <dig> deficient offspring fostered on wild-type mothers had reduced birth weight and also had inferior growth rates compared to wild-type offspring  <cit> . plagl <dig> deficient mice also produced offspring with reduced birth weight, and postnatal mortality was high, albeit difficult to interpret because of delayed lung maturity  <cit> .

both the maternally expressed imprinted genes grb <dig> and igf2r inhibit post-natal growth by blocking mitogenic effects of igf <dig> and igf <dig>  <cit> . grb <dig> negatively regulates igf <dig>  <cit>  whereas igf2r over-expression results in decreased cell growth and proliferation due to increased clearance of igf <dig> levels as well as reduced phosphorylation of igf <dig> receptor  <cit> . over-expression of igf <dig> results in prolonged lactation  <cit> , while deletion of both igf <dig> and igf1r results in reduced ductal side branching and fewer teb, respectively  <cit> . igf <dig> has been shown to mediate prolactin induced alveolar development in the mammary gland and acts upstream of cyclin d <dig> during mid-pregnancy  <cit> . hence, a relatively lower level of grb <dig> and igf2r gene expression is consistent enhanced maternal performance.

CONCLUSIONS
to summarize, differential expression patterns of candidate genes in a number of pathways, including tight junction, mapk and wnt signalling pathways were associated with enhanced maternal performance of qsi <dig> mice relative to cba mice. mapk and wnt pathways are both known regulators of ductal morphogenesis and alveolar development, while tight junction permeability is related to milk secretion,. additionally, favourable expression patterns of imprinted genes in qsi <dig> mice may also contribute to a superior maternal performance phenotype.
