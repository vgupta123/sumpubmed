BACKGROUND
an increase in post-prandial blood glucose stimulates pancreatic β-cells to secrete insulin, which mediates glucose disposal into tissues such as muscle and fat. glucose also acutely stimulates insulin translation, which replenishes the β-cell granules that have been depleted during secretion  <cit> . the effect of glucose on translation increases the protein folding load in the endoplasmic reticulum  of the β-cell, which may transiently induce er stress, a condition in which the folding capacity of the er is insufficient for the level of newly synthesized secretory proteins and results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins. such conditions are sensed by er localized stress sensors that mediate the unfolded protein response   <cit> . this results in a transient reduction in translation efficiency to reduce secretory protein load and induces chaperone capacity and er-associated degradation . er stress is likely a physiological situation the β-cell transiently experiences following feeding.

er stress is also a feature of pathological conditions associated with obesity and diabetes. excess nutrients , amyloid deposits and inflammatory cytokines have all been shown to induce er stress in pancreatic β-cells  <cit> . these conditions induce the upr pathways that attempt to counteract er stress. however, chronic er stress can lead to apoptosis induction  <cit> , particularly in cell types with high secretory capacity such as the β-cell. this is evident from the fact that perturbation of the upr signaling pathways in vivo leads to pancreatic β-cell death in animal models  <cit>  and humans  <cit>  and mutations in the insulin molecule in akita mice results in er stress-induced β-cell apoptosis  <cit> . in addition, it has been hypothesized that chronic conditions associated with obesity over time may lead to chronic er stress-induced β-cell death and depletion of β-cell mass that results in type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> .

thus, understanding how pancreatic β-cells deal with, and respond to er stress, is vital for understanding β-cell biology under physiological and pathological conditions. a detailed temporal analysis of the er stress response in β-cells has not been conducted. in addition the molecular mechanism of er stress-induced apoptosis is still, for the most part, unclear. as mentioned, expression of folding-deficient proinsulin in the akita mouse leads to pancreatic β-cell death as a result of er stress and apoptosis  <cit> . thus, the akita mouse provides a model of β-cell dysfunction resulting from er stress and affords a system to study the er stress response independently of using commonly used toxins such as thapsigargin or tunicamycin.

to study the er stress response in pancreatic β-cells we developed a pancreatic β-cell culture system based on the akita mouse. inducible expression of mutant insulin  <dig>  fused to egfp  caused er stress and apoptosis. in this study we examined the temporal gene expression response resulting from induction of ins <dig> -egfp expression in ins- <dig> β-cells and the role of erad in mediating cell survival.

methods
cloning of the ptre-tight insulin  <dig> -egfp construct
full-length wild-type mouse insulin  <dig> cdna was amplified by pcr from pins <dig> -egfp, a fusion construct obtained from dr. seiichi oyadomari   <cit> . the pcr fragment was cloned into pcrii-topo vector . using the quikchange ii xl site-directed mutagenesis kit , a c96y mutation was introduced into the insulin  <dig> cdna. the mutation was confirmed by dna sequencing. ins <dig>  was cloned into the pegfp-n <dig> vector , the stop codon was removed and the resulting fusion construct pins <dig> -egfp was cloned into the nhei/noti site of a ptre-tight vector .

generation of an inducible insulin  <dig> -egfp expressing ins- <dig> β-cell line
initially a stable ptet-on ins- <dig> clone was generated by transfecting ins- <dig> cells   <cit>  with the ptet-on plasmid and stable clones were selected following the protocol provided . several clones were isolated and tested by transient transfection using a luciferase reporter assay and the clone with the lowest basal expression and highest doxycyline induction  was used for generation of the double stable cell line.

double-stable ins <dig> -egfp expressing cells were generated by co-transfection with a hygromycin resistance plasmid and the ptre -ins <dig> -egfp plasmid into ptet-on ins- <dig> # <dig> cells and selection by addition of antibiotics:  <dig> μg/ml geneticin and  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin b . individual clones were isolated and tested for ins <dig> -egfp expression by western blotting and immunofluorescence before and after induction with doxycycline  for  <dig> h. a positive clone was identified and fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate the highest 20% of egfp-positive cells in this clonal population after induction with doxycycline for  <dig> h. the cells were expanded in media without doxycycline and referred to as clone #4s <dig> 

clone #4s <dig> cells were maintained in rpmi  <dig>  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig> μm β-mercaptoethanol with antibiotics  and selection drugs .

cell fractionation
following doxycycline treatment for  <dig> hours, clone #4s <dig> cells were washed with pbs and resuspended in homogenization buffer: ,  <dig> mm pmsf,  <dig> mm naf,  <dig> mm na3vo <dig>   <dig> nm okadaic acid). cells were homogenized on ice with  <dig> strokes using a ball-bearing cell homogenizer. the resulting homogenate was either centrifuged at  <dig> 000×g for  <dig>  h to generate membrane  and cytosol  fractions, or subjected to a  <dig>  m to  <dig> m sucrose gradient for  <dig> h at  <dig>  <dig> rpm, 4°c as outlined in  <cit> . after ultracentrifugation,  <dig>  ml fractions were taken from the top of the gradient.

electron microscopy
clone #4s <dig> cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde  in  <dig>  m sorensen's phosphate buffer   for  <dig> min at room temperature. the cells were washed twice with pbs and collected into new tubes. samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopy by the electron microscopy facility at mount sinai hospital . briefly, the cell pellets were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m sodium cacodylate buffer  for  <dig> h, rinsed with the same buffer for  <dig> min, and post-fixed for  <dig>  h in 1% oso <dig>  after rinsing with the same buffer for  <dig> min, the cells were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series up to 100% ethanol. the cells were then embedded in spurr resin in an oven at 65°c overnight. thin sections  were cut with an rmc mt <dig> ultramicrotome. the sections were placed on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate  and lead citrate . the grids were examined in a fei tecnai  <dig> transmission electron microscope and images were captured using a gatan dualview digital camera.

rna isolation and real-time pcr analysis
for real-time pcr analysis, total rna was isolated from cells untreated or treated with  <dig> μg/ml doxycycline for the indicated times using trizol reagent  followed by purification with rneasy mini kit . total rna was reverse transcribed to single-stranded cdna using the high-capacity cdna reverse transcription kit . the resulting cdna was used for real-time pcr analysis by the taqman gene expression system  as described previously  <cit> . the following primers were obtained from applied biosystems: chop , atf <dig> , grp <dig> , pdi , ero1α , ero1β , sel <dig> , erdj <dig> , erdj <dig> , β-actin .

xbp <dig> splicing assay

sirna transfection
clone #4s <dig> cells were reverse transfected using lipofectamine rnaimax with  <dig> nm herp sirna  or a control sirna  as described previously  <cit> . twenty-four hours later the cells were incubated or not with doxycycline for  <dig> h then either lysed for western blot analysis or for measurement of apoptosis using the cell death elisa kit .

apoptosis assays
cell apoptosis was measured using the cell death detection elisa kit  according to the instructions provided in the kit. briefly, clone #4s <dig> cells were seeded in 24-well plates  and treated as indicated in the figure legends. following the treatments, the cells were lysed and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasm  were quantified according to the manufacturer's instructions.

terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick-end labeling  assays were performed using the apo-brdu tunel assay kit . clone #4s <dig> cells were treated as described in the figure legend, washed with warm pbs, trypsinized, then stained with fluor- <dig> dye-labeled anti-brdu antibody, as described by the manufacturer's instructions. after staining, the samples were analyzed in a facscalibur flow cytometer . to standardize each sample and set the quandrants, a negative control  and a positive control  were used. gfp and the fluor- <dig> dye-labeled anti-brdu antibody were excited using the fl <dig>  and fl <dig>  lasers, respectively.

microarray analysis
microarray expression profiling was used to assess the global transcriptional changes in response to ins <dig> -egfp expression in clone #4s <dig> cells. cells were induced or not with doxycycline for  <dig> h,  <dig> h or  <dig> days and total rna was isolated using trizol reagent  followed by isolation using an rneasy mini kit . assessment of rna quality and microarray analysis was performed at the university health network  microarray centre. briefly, following rna quality assessment with an agilent bioanalyzer, samples were reverse transcribed to cdna. cdna was purified with a cdna purification module from affymetrix. biotin was incorporated during in vitro transcription and purified crna was then fragmented with a chemical reaction.  <dig> μg of labeled and fragmented crna was hybridized to rat genome  <dig>  <dig>  arrays  for  <dig> h at 45°c at  <dig> rpm. the arrays were stained and washed using fluidic stations with antibody and streptavidin phycoerythrin conjugate solutions. all arrays are scanned using an affymetrix  <dig> 7g scanner. the data sets were analyzed using genespring software   and statistical analysis was performed using genespring software according to the manufacturer's specifications. genes with a minimum 2-fold difference between control and doxycycline-treated cells in at least two independent experiments at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> days are listed in the additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the raw microarray data has been deposited in the gene expression omnibus  database .

data analysis
results are presented as mean ± se. statistical significance between two experimental conditions was analyzed using a two-sample t-test assuming equal variance. data from several or more groups was analyzed by anova, followed by tukey post hoc test. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
generation and characterization of the insulin  <dig> -egfp stable ins- <dig> cell line
we first generated a stable ptet-on ins- <dig> cell line that allows for doxycycline-inducible protein expression. the cell line was tested by transient transfection of the ins <dig> -egfp fusion construct in the presence or absence of doxycycline. fusion protein expression was monitored by western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. expression of the fusion protein was doxycyline-dependent and the fusion protein was excluded from the nucleus and localized throughout the cell . interestingly, the expression of this construct also resulted in the production of a lower migrating band, which may be due to proteolytic cleavage of the fusion construct in the cell . a stable ins <dig> -egfp ptet-on cell line was generated by co-transfection with a hygromycin resistance plasmid. we isolated a clone with inducible mutant insulin expression and fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate egfp-positive cells  after  <dig> h of doxycycline induction. the sorted cells  was expanded in media without doxycycline. this clone exhibited low basal ins2-egfp expression and a marked induction following doxycycline treatment .

in addition to the full-length fusion protein other gfp immunoreactive bands were observed in both tx- <dig> detergent whole cell lysates or lysates prepared by direct lysis of the cells in sds sample buffer . these fragments are likely degradation products of the full-length fusion protein and most of the fragments could not be efficiently immunoprecipitated using an anti-gfp antibody . cells were homogenized and subjected to membrane and cytosol fractionation. whereas the full-length ins <dig> -egfp fusion protein could be detected in the membrane fraction, the degradation fragments were present exclusively in the cytosol fraction . the full-length fusion protein was detected in er fractions by sucrose density fractionation while the lower migrating degradation fragments were present exclusively in the cytosol fractions . since no degradation fragments were present in microsome fractions it is likely that degradation of the full-length fusion protein occurs in the cytosol. the presence of some soluble er lumenal grp <dig> -egfp) in cytosolic fractions in the sucrose gradient may be due to some leakage during cell homogenization.

we examined the morphology of the stable cell line by electron microscopy before and after doxycycline induction. in non-induced cells a normal er morphology was observed , whereas cells expressing ins <dig> -egfp for three days had an altered er morphology . the er was expanded and dilated compared to control cells. the er tended to be even more severely dilated in many of the cells after six days of mutant insulin expression . this morphology is characteristic of unfolded protein accumulation and er stress  <cit>  and has been observed in β-cells of the akita mouse  <cit> . in addition, apoptotic cells were observed in the population expressing the fusion protein .

the er stress response to insulin  <dig> -egfp expression
the morphological analysis indicated that the expression of ins <dig> -egfp was causing an accumulation of this protein in the er and causing er stress. we thus examined whether doxycycline-induced expression of ins <dig> -egfp was activating upr signaling pathways. ins <dig> -egfp expression was induced for various times and activation of the er stress-sensing pathways was monitored. spliced xbp- <dig>  indicative of ire1α activation, was detected after  <dig> h of doxycyline induction and similar levels of spliced xbp- <dig> were present throughout the induction period for up to  <dig> days . the levels of phospho-eif2α, indicative of perk activation, were also increased , as were the levels of active atf6-p <dig> . thus, expression of the mutant insulin causes measurable activation of the er stress pathways mediated by ire1α, perk and atf <dig> 

to examine the global transcriptional response to mutant insulin expression we performed microarray analysis of the gene expression changes following ins <dig> -egfp expression. total rna was prepared after  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> days of doxycycline treatment from three independent experiments, reverse transcribed and hybridized to affymetrix rat genome arrays. gene expression changes were examined and those that were upregulated or downregulated by 2-fold after doxycyline-induced expression of ins <dig> -egfp are listed in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  following  <dig> h induction  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated. after  <dig> h induction  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated, whereas  <dig> genes were induced and  <dig> reduced after  <dig> days induction. these numbers include genes  that were identified as statistically significant in at least two of three experiments.

shown in table  <dig> are a selected list of genes induced >2-fold in at least two independent experiments at the various time points. this list includes genes involved in the upr response, protein folding and modification, erad and protein transport. several patterns emerged from this analysis. after  <dig> h of mutant protein expression, the majority of the genes induced were er localized chaperone genes  as well as the erad-associated genes . the sdf2l <dig> gene was the most abundantly induced gene present in all three experiments. in addition, the atf <dig> and chop transcription factors, target genes of the perk-eif2α pathway, were also induced in two out of three experiments at this early time point. trib <dig> , a putative target gene of the chop transcription factor  <cit> , was also induced in two out of three experiments.

mean fold change from three independent experiments for each time point is shown. bold indicates the gene was induced in at least  <dig> independent experiments and italics indicates average induction value of multiple probes for the same gene.

following  <dig> h of mutant protein expression a greater number of genes were induced compared to  <dig> h . additional chaperone genes  were upregulated. the levels of the chop transcription factor were also significantly higher than at the  <dig> h time point. however, the most abundantly induced gene at  <dig> h of mutant protein expression was trib <dig> , a gene whose protein product has been implicated in apoptosis among other cellular processes  <cit> . at this time point other genes including protein transport genes and transcription factors were also upregulated. by  <dig> days of mutant protein expression the gene expression changes as monitored by microarray was more variable between experiments than at the  <dig> h time point. however, all the chaperone genes observed at earlier time points were still elevated and additional pdi family member genes  were induced. the levels of trib <dig> were lower compared to the  <dig> h time point, but still elevated. interestingly, the levels of sdf2l <dig>  creld <dig> and armet remained highly induced throughout the time course of mutant protein expression.

although some of the gene expression changes found were expected based on the er stress response induced in other models , some genes predicted to be increased were not observed, such as the er chaperone genes grp <dig> and pdi. microarray expression profiling can lead to false negatives due to inefficient probes. we therefore examined the mrna and protein levels of several well established targets of the upr by real-time pcr and western blotting. an increase in the mrna levels of grp <dig>  pdi, chop and sel <dig> was observed in response to doxycycline-induced mutant insulin expression . the latter two changes substantiate the microarray results. however, both grp <dig> and pdi are significantly upregulated early  of mutant insulin expression. this was not detected by microarray, which does produce false negative results in this case. consistent with the gene expression data, grp <dig> and chop protein levels were also induced by ins <dig> -egfp expression . interestingly, thapsigargin treatment for  <dig> h induced higher expression of chop protein in clone #4s <dig> than in parental ins- <dig> cells, suggesting that clone #4s <dig> are more susceptible to er stress .

we performed additional real-time pcr analysis of other putative er stress response genes to validate some of the microarray results . consistent with the microarray data  we observed an induction of erdj <dig>  but not the related gene erdj5/dnajc <dig>  despite the fact that the latter has been shown to be induced by er stress in other cell types  <cit> . in addition, although not detected by microarray, we observed induction of ero1β, but not ero1α . the former, but not the latter, has been reported to be er stress-inducible, which is consistent with our results  <cit> . it is important to note that doxycyline at the same concentration used in these studies added to a parental ins- <dig> cell line does not induce any changes in grp <dig> or chop mrna or protein levels , indicating that the changes observed are due to ins <dig> -egfp expression and not the small molecule.

overall, the microarray and real-time pcr results show that ins <dig> -egfp expression causes the induction of many established er stress response genes, although there is clearly some selectivity in the genes induced.

induction of apoptosis following insulin  <dig> -egfp expression
as shown in table  <dig>  genes associated with apoptosis such as chop and trib <dig> were already upregulated after  <dig> h of mutant insulin expression and the expression levels were even greater after  <dig> h. we thus examined whether doxycycline-induced expression of ins <dig> -egfp induces apoptosis. by light microscopy many of the cells appear rounded in comparison to the control cells at about  <dig> h of mutant protein expression, indicative of dead or dying cells . to confirm that cell death was due to apoptosis we measured cytoplasmic dna-associated histone complexes using a sensitive elisa assay and found that  <dig> h to 7-day treatment of doxycycline causes apoptosis in a time-dependent manner . western blot analysis also revealed a detectable increase in cleaved caspase- <dig> by ~ <dig> days of mutant protein expression . to identify the relative percentage of apoptotic cells in the mutant insulin expressing population we monitored apoptosis by tunel assay using facs analysis, which also allowed for the detection of mutant protein expression by the gfp fluorescence. addition of doxycycline increased gfp fluorescence depicted on the y-axis, compared to control cells not treated with doxycycline . the percentage of apoptotic  cells is low and comparable to control cells following  <dig> h doxycycline induction . however, mutant protein expression following  <dig> days of doxycycline treatment leads to the induction of apoptosis in approximately 14% of the population .

the extent of apoptosis observed in the population expressing ins <dig> -egfp even for extended periods  seemed rather low. we hypothesized that the er stress response in these cells, particularly the induction of erad genes, might be responsible for maintaining cell survival by degrading the misfolded insulin and preventing accumulation to toxic levels. we therefore examined whether inhibiting the erad system might sensitize the cells to cell death. as a first approach we inhibited proteasome function using lactacystin. cells were induced with doxycycline for  <dig> h then treated or not with lactacystin and cell apoptosis was monitored. inhibition of the proteasome resulted in a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the population . this was also accompanied by an increase in the cellular levels of ubiquinated proteins  and an increase in the levels of ins <dig> -egfp fusion protein and degradation fragments . these results suggest that inhibiting erad increases misfolded protein levels and enhances er stress-induced apoptosis.

as an alternative approach for inhibiting erad we targeted the herp protein which was found to be induced early by mutant insulin expression . herp has been implicated in erad of certain misfolded proteins  <cit> , although whether it is required for misfolded insulin degradation has not been examined. we first confirmed that the herp protein is induced in response to mutant insulin expression . to perturb erad function, we blunted the induction of herp expression using sirna . reducing herp expression by about 40-50% resulted in an increase in the steady-state levels of the mutant insulin protein, even in the absence of doxycycline induction . this also increased apoptosis levels in the population relative to control sirna transfected cells . with doxycyline induction for  <dig> h the levels of ins <dig> -egfp in herp sirna-treated cells was increased relative to control sirna transfected cells, but the effect was small . in some experiments we also observed a reduction in the degradation fragments in herp sirna-treated cells , but this was not a consistent finding . the inconsistent results may be due to the inefficient knock-down of the herp protein achieved in these studies. regardless, the levels of apoptosis in the population depleted of herp expression was significantly higher compared to control sirna-transfected cells as measured by cleaved caspase  <dig> levels . altogether, these results suggest that the mutant insulin is an erad target and that herp function is required for its degradation and that reducing herp levels increases mutant insulin levels and sensitizes the cells to apoptosis.

discussion
the upr is an essential process by which cells respond to the accumulation of misfolded protein in the er. this can occur either physiologically, as a result of acute secretory protein load, or as a result of pathological insults that may impede protein folding capacity. the basic er stress response is well established involving an acute translational attenuation followed by the upregulation of a transcriptional profile that includes er chaperone genes, erad components, protein transport genes, among others  <cit> . however, it is probable that different cell types have a unique profile of upregulated genes that are dependent on a particular cells function and the secretory proteins it produces. the goal of the present study was to examine the er stress response in the insulin producing pancreatic β-cell. to do this we developed a pancreatic β-cell culture model with inducible expression of a folding-deficient insulin fusion protein based on the proinsulin mutation found in the akita mouse  <cit> . the rationale behind this approach was that regulated expression of a single misfolded protein would allow for a temporal characterization of the upr in β-cells. this may reflect the er stress response to physiological conditions  and potentially a chronic response induced by pathological conditions occurring in type  <dig> diabetes .

using the tetracycline/doxycycline-regulated expression system we created a double stable ins- <dig> cell clone with stable integration of the ptet-on regulatory plasmid and the ins <dig> -egfp plasmid driven by the tet/dox-responsive promoter. the egfp tag was used in order to facilitate selection of stable clones, as well as for sorting of the positive clones for cells with high expression of the ins <dig> -egfp fusion protein. in the clone selected for the studies basal expression of the mutant insulin is low, although detectable. following doxycyline addition the mutant insulin is markedly induced by  <dig> h, reaching maximal expression by ~ <dig> h and expression is maintained for several days. expression of the mutant insulin fusion protein leads to a swollen er lumen that is readily detectable in many cells and is indicative of misfolded protein accumulation and a stressed er. this result is similar to the phenotype observed in the β-cells of akita mice  <cit> . as expected, expression of folding-deficient ins  <dig> -egfp fusion protein resulted in the induction of upr pathways .

to analyze the er stress response in the cell line we performed microarray expression profiling and real time pcr analysis at various times following mutant protein expression. we chose time-points of ins <dig> -egfp expression when no significant apoptosis was observed  and longer expression time points , when apoptotic cell death was detectable. after  <dig> h,  <dig> genes were induced, while the number of induced genes was substantially increased after  <dig> h  and  <dig> days . interestingly, the number of downregulated genes was also increased at the longer incubation times . this may reflect the observation that prolonged activation of ire1α can result in relaxed specificity and cleavage of cellular mrnas  <cit> , resulting in the downregulation of some genes as a result of prolonged er stress.

after  <dig> h of ins <dig> -egfp expression the most consistently induced genes were er resident chaperones and co-chaperones  and an erad component . the j-domain containing co-chaperones  have been shown to be induced by er stress in various cell types  <cit> . recently, p58ipk and erdj <dig> have been found to interact with misfolded proteins in the er prior to recruitment of the chaperone grp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, these proteins have also been implicated in targeting misfolded proteins for degradation via the erad system  <cit> . thus, expression of misfolded insulin causes the induction of chaperone proteins early in an effort to fold the mutant insulin. these chaperones are maintained at high levels throughout the time course of mutant insulin induction and some may assist in degradation of the misfolded molecule once folding is found to be futile . the importance of p58ipk function in normal pancreatic β-cells in vivo is evidenced by increased pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and hyperglycemia in knock-out mice  <cit> . however, the detailed molecular function of these co-chaperones in β-cells has not been examined to date.

interestingly, although there are six mammalian dnaj domain-containing proteins, we only found a subset to be induced by mutant insulin expression. notable among those that were not upregulated is erdj <dig>  recently, expression of a folding-deficient version of the secreted protein surfactant protein c in hek <dig> cells caused the induction of various er stress response genes, including erdj <dig> and erdj <dig>  which were shown to be required for degradation of the folding-deficient surfactant protein c  <cit> . surfactant protein c, like proinsulin, contains disulfide bonds, but is not glycosylated. thus, it is interesting that we do not observe induction of erdj <dig> in β-cells expressing folding-deficient proinsulin. a recent report, however, has shown that erdj <dig> can interact with edem proteins and is required for reducing disulfide bonds on misfolded, glycosylated proteins prior to retrotranslocation  <cit> . edem genes were not detected in the microarray analysis, suggesting that proinsulin may not require edem or erdj <dig> for its degradation.

comparing the upr response observed in our study to er stress responses in other cell types shows that some of the early chaperone genes induced by mutant protein expression are not observed in other systems. for example, tunicamycin treatment of neuroblastoma cells  <cit>  or expression of a retroviral protein in astrocytes, which induces er stress  <cit> , did not cause an upregulation of erdj <dig>  p58ipk , erdj <dig>  or fkbp <dig>  importantly, all of these genes have been shown to be induced by er stress caused by prolonged palmitate exposure in cultured mouse min <dig> cells  <cit> . saturated ffas have been shown to induce er stress in pancreatic β-cells and this may contribute to β-cell dysfunction  <cit> . in addition, a recent proteomic study examining islets from a diabetic insulin resistant mouse model has shown that the protein  of some of these  are upregulated  <cit> . thus, the induction of these genes/proteins are likely important cell protective er stress response proteins in β-cells and a detailed biochemical analysis of their function in mediating proinsulin folding and/or degradation is warranted.

in addition to er chaperone genes and erad components, several other genes were found to be induced early as a result of ins <dig> -egfp expression, including sdf2l <dig>  armet and creld <dig>  all three were abundantly upregulated at both early and late time points. the exact functions of the protein products of these genes in the er stress response is largely undefined, although these proteins have also been reported to be induced by er stress-inducing compounds such as tunicamycin in other cell types  <cit> .

the appearance of prominent lower migrating bands recognized by anti-gfp antibodies indicates that the ins <dig> -egfp fusion protein is being degraded. similar cleavage products have been detected with wild-type proinsulin tagged with gfp at the c-terminus and was suggested to occur from non-specific cleavage of the fusion protein at some point along the secretory pathway  <cit> . in the case of the ins <dig> -egfp the cleavage products are not efficiently immunoprecipitated by anti-gfp antibodies and are not detected in er fractions. thus, the smaller migrating bands recognized by gfp antibodies are likely degradation products of proteolysis occurring in the cytoplasm. the full-length mutant insulin fusion protein appears to be inaccessible to the secretory pathway and is retained in the er, which is consistent with a report showing that the c96y mutation in proinsulin results in misfolding of the molecule and retention in the er  <cit> .

the ins <dig> -egfp fusion protein is likely degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent erad system. the erad-associated genes herp and sel <dig> were induced by mutant insulin expression, which is consistent with the finding that sel <dig> is upregulated in akita islets  <cit> . inhibiting the 26s proteasome resulted in an increase in the levels of ins <dig> -egfp and sensitized the cells to cell death. this was also the effect observed by reducing herp expression using sirna, a protein recently shown to be required for the degradation of a disulfide bond-containing mutant version of the kappa light chain  <cit> . the process of ins <dig> -egfp degradation however, may be quite complex. if the proteasome was responsible for generating the degradation fragments observed  than inhibiting the proteasome would be expected to not affect the steady-state levels of these fragments; new fragments would be prevented from being generated from ins <dig> -egfp and fragments already present prevented from being degraded. however, most degradation fragments were actually increased by proteasome inhibition , suggesting that other proteases may be responsible for generating the degradation fragments that are then targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation.

it should be pointed out that although expression of the ins <dig> -egfp fusion protein induces er stress and degradation of the fusion protein, due to the presence of the egfp tag the degradation of the fusion construct may not be identical to the degradation of untagged proinsulin c96y. furthermore, it is possible that the er stress response elicited by untagged proinsulin c96y is different compared to that of ins <dig> -egfp. these possibilities should be explored in future studies.

this model system also allowed us to examine potential gene expression changes associated with er stress-induced cell death. an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor chop and one of its target genes  was evident by  <dig> h of ins <dig> -egfp expression, which is indicative of perk pathway activation and is likely to be a normal physiological response. at this time point no significant apoptosis is detected in the population. after  <dig> h of mutant insulin expression however, the levels of chop and trib <dig> were even higher, which coincided with detection of apoptosis in the population. thus, a sustained increase in the levels of chop and trib <dig> proteins may tilt cells towards apoptosis induction. pancreatic β-cells of chop-deficient heterozygous akita mice are partially protected from cell death  <cit> , although clearly there are other factors also involved. in the mutant insulin expressing cell line the most highly induced gene after  <dig> h was trib <dig>  recently, the trib <dig> protein has been shown to be induced by the perk-atf4-chop pathway and has been implicated in mediating apoptosis  <cit>  and in hyperglycemia-induced pancreatic β-cell death  <cit> . the mechanism of this effect, however, is unclear. whether the trib <dig> protein is responsible for apoptosis induction and how much of the apoptosis is trib3-dependent in this model system requires future study.

despite the abundant upregulation of chop and trib <dig> in response to mutant insulin expression, the level of apoptotic cells in the population remained rather low, even after long term expression of the mutant construct. this is likely because one of the main cell protective effects induced by the upr, erad, is also upregulated. inhibition of erad by inhibiting the cytosolic proteasome or inhibiting herp upregulation sensitizes the cells to apoptosis, supporting the notion that the erad pathway may support cell survival by degradation of misfolded insulin.

CONCLUSIONS
the β-cell model of er stress described in this study has allowed for a detailed characterization of the er stress response induced by misfolded ins <dig> -egfp expression and for the identification of both cell protective and possible cell destructive genes. the repertoire of genes/proteins induced is unique to this cell type compared to the upr induced in other cell types, perhaps reflecting the unique role of β-cells to produce insulin. the herp protein and er-associated degradation is essential for maintaining cell survival in cells expressing mutant insulin. the cell model developed here will be useful in studies examining the function of er stress-induced genes.
