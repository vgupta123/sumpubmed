BACKGROUND
the use of genetic data as a complement to morphological and behavioral data is now common in addressing the problem of species delimitation. although single mitochondrial genes such as coi used in dna barcoding have proved highly effective in species delimitation in animals and plants  <cit> , it is important test hypotheses of putative species with independent nuclear loci. for recently diverged species, lineage sorting can be incomplete and widespread in genomes, but new coalescent methods exist that can help to detect signals of species even before lineages have become reciprocally monophyletic  <cit> . although gene trees can be discordant and complicate the recovery of species trees, they can also be concordant and provide strong support for species delimitation.

one example of taxonomic uncertainty in recently diverged lineages is provided by water rails , which are distributed widely in the palearctic wetlands from iceland to japan, and occupy a range of approximately  <dig> million km <dig>  the global population is thought to be large, with an estimated  <dig> - <dig>  individuals in their european distribution  <cit> . water rails are confined to wetlands, which have contracted in recent history, and thus their populations are now strikingly fragmented . further distributional complexity arises because southern and western european populations are mainly sedentary, whereas northernmost european and east asian populations migrate between northern breeding grounds and southern wintering areas  <cit> .

samples sizes of rails analyzed in this study.

taxonomic uncertainty exists about the number of species or subspecies that might be recognized in the water rails complex. some authors suggested that water rails form a superspecies complex with the kaffir rail  and madagascar rail  due to similarities in size, coloration, and the startling calls they share  <cit> .

water rails had previously been placed in four subspecies differentiated by morphological variation and geographic range: r. a. aquaticus in europe including the british isles, northern africa to north-western asia; r. a. hibernans in iceland; r. a. korejewi in western to middle asia, and r. a. indicus in eastern asia, including japan  <cit> . however, recent morphological studies supported subspecies status  for eastern asian birds  <cit> , but could not detect differences between the other three subspecies. r. a. korejewi and r. a. hibernans differ by small variations in external plumage and measurements that overlap gradually from west to east. the icelandic population of r. a. hibernans became extinct about  <dig> due to widespread draining of wetlands and predation by mink , and now non-breeding birds probably from scandinavia migrate to iceland in autumn and winter  <cit> . birds from east asian populations are distinguished from those in west and middle asia and europe by proportionally larger dimensions, less sexual dimorphism is size, less contrastingly banded flanks, black-and-white-barred under tails coverts , darker tip of the neck and breast feathers, higher percentage of barred outer coverts in the wing, and a whiter supercilium above a brown eye-stripe  <cit> . a recent classification therefore referred to this lineage with a distinct common name as the brown-cheeked rail , reflecting differences from the other water rail subspecies   <cit> , and hereafter we use these vernaculars and refer to them collectively as water rails.

the oldest fossil remains of a rail which is the closest relative to the ancestor of all water rails are phalange bones found in caves in the carpathian basin dated from the pliocene   <cit> . more recent fossils from the upper pleistocene suggest that water rails were already widely distributed two million years ago; fossils have been found in ireland, united kingdom, belgium, france, italy, cyprus, germany, poland, austria, croatia, bosnia-herzegovina, hungary, czech republic, ukraine, romania, greece, jordan, israel, china and japan  <cit> . climate and environmental changes associated with the last four ice ages, along with tectonic activities that occurred in europe and asia, could potentially have had a great impact on water rail populations. the association of particular historical events with population differentiation and possibly speciation requires inference of the species tree, divergence times and levels of gene flow.

in the present study we investigate the phylogeny and population structure of the water rail species-complex using three independent loci, including the coi dna barcode region. specifically, we investigate whether genetic evidence supports the brown-cheeked rail and water rail as separate species, the number of subspecies that should be recognized, and whether phylogeographic patterns within the water rail complex relate to known historical events that may have structured populations genetically.

RESULTS
genetic variation and base composition
the numbers of base pairs  sequenced for coi, adh <dig>  and ptpn <dig> were respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  yielding a combined data set of  <dig>  bp. the number of individuals sequenced for each population varied, but sequences for all three genes were determined for  <dig> water rails, and two virginia rails . translation of the protein-coding genes coi and ptpn <dig> did not reveal stop codons or frame-shift mutations, and third codon positions were more variable than first and second codon positions as expected in functional genes. three indels of one or two bases were observed in the adh <dig> intron. polymorphism due to heterozygosity was observed in the nuclear partitions adh <dig> and ptpn <dig>  the average base composition among water rails for each gene partition was  <dig> % a,  <dig> % c,  <dig> % g,  <dig> % t for coi;  <dig> % a,  <dig> % c,  <dig> % g,  <dig> % t for adh5; and  <dig> % a,  <dig> % c, 23% g,  <dig> % t for ptpn <dig>  best-fit models of nucleotide substitution selected with the akaike information criterion  were unequal-frequency kimura 3-parameter plus gamma  for coi, and hasegawa-kishino-yano  for adh <dig> and ptpn <dig> 

a total of  <dig> unique haplotypes defined by  <dig> variable sites was identified in sequences from mitochondrial coi of  <dig> specimens of brown-cheeked and water rails . sequences from phased genotypes of adh <dig> and ptpn <dig> revealed  <dig> and six variable sites identifying  <dig> and nine unique haplotypes in each nuclear gene, respectively . the brown-cheeked rail and the water rail did not share alleles for the three genes studied, except for one allele  in the most slowly evolving gene, ptpn <dig>  which could reflect retained ancestral polymorphism . west and middle asian and european populations from east kazakhstan, west siberia, and europe were included in the water rail clade, they shared haplotypes in the three genes, and showed the highest haplotype diversity in the faster mitochondrial gene coi, as expected. moreover, a single haplotype  was the only one common to all populations in the western part of the water rail distribution. singleton coi haplotypes differed from the most common haplotype  by one or two mutational steps . the number of mutational steps separating the brown-cheeked rail and water rail was  <dig> and two, for coi and adh <dig>  respectively. with the exception of one shared haplotype, one mutational step separated the two groups of water rails at ptpn <dig>  corresponding corrected genetic distances, calculated using the best-fit model for each partition were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, for coi, adh <dig> and ptpn <dig>  respectively.

phylogenetic analysis and relationship among breeding populations
monophyletic groups of brown-cheeked rails and water rails were recovered in ml and bayesian analyses of coi  and adh <dig> , with a posterior probability of  <dig> for clusters in coi . analyses of ptpn <dig>  revealed a monophyletic group composed of all sampled individuals of the brown-cheeked rail, but node support was lower . reciprocal monophyly of brown-cheeked rails and water rails was strongly supported in a bayesian analysis of the three genes combined . the chance occurrence of reciprocal monophyly between the brown-cheeked rail and water rail was rejected .

the species tree estimated with *beast recovered the brown-cheeked rail and water rail as reciprocally monophyletic groups with posterior probabilities of  <dig> . within these clades the relationships among the sampled populations were not resolved. this reflects the high number of shared alleles among the populations of both water rails and brown-cheeked rails, but not between them.

population structure and coalescent analyses
sequence data sets for all populations had nonsignificant values  of tajima's d values and fu and li's d* and f* statistics, suggesting all three genes are selectively neutral. therefore, it is appropriate to use them to estimate gene flow and other parameters with neutral coalescent methods.

analyses of the genotypes at the two nuclear loci using structure supported two major clusters corresponding to the population samples of the water rail and the brown-cheeked rail. the posterior probability of this run was  <dig> , versus  <dig>  for the model assuming  <dig> populations . however, the model with two populations performed better than the one with three, with estimated mean population assignment probabilities of individuals in populations  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. the model with three populations performed poorly in assigning samples of the water rail to two clusters, the highest population assignment probability for membership of an individual to clusters  <dig> and  <dig> being only  <dig>  .

both nuclear loci showed recombination by the four-gamete criterion, adh <dig> between sites  <dig> and  <dig>  and ptpn <dig> between sites  <dig> and  <dig>  however, the program im used to estimate gene flow assumes no within-locus recombination, so we split each locus into two blocks of sequence that did not show evidence of recombination  <cit> . blocks were from characters  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> for adh <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> for ptpn <dig>  each of these blocks was analyzed in im as different loci.

the coalescent analysis assuming the less parameterized isolation-without-migration model had marginally significantly lower log likelihood than the isolation-with-migration model . the latter suggested no gene flow between populations of the brown-cheeked and water rail after their divergence; values of m <dig> =  <dig>   and m <dig> =  <dig>   were very low and the lower 95% credibility intervals approached zero. therefore we interpreted the coalescent parameters of divergence time and effective population size from the analysis using the model of isolation-without-migration. this less parameterized model also allowed divergence time to be estimated more precisely , suggesting the split between brown-cheeked and water rails occurred ~ <dig>  years ago . the effective population size estimated for the brown-cheeked rail was  <dig>  , which was similar to the values estimated for water rails . effective size of the ancestral population could not be estimated properly with three loci, and sorting of alleles into reciprocally monophyletic groups .

discussion
species delimitation is supported by genetics, morphology and vocalizations
analysis of dna sequences indicated unambiguously that the birds from insular and continental locations in east asia  are clearly differentiated from the groups sampled further west from breeding populations in europe, west siberia, and kazakhstan . the overall kimura 3-parameter genetic distance between water rail and brown-cheeked rail clades for coi was > 3% including  <dig> fixed nucleotide substitutions. this number of substitutions falls well within the range expected between closely related species. of  <dig> sister species-pairs of birds surveyed with the same coi barcode sequence  <dig> were separated by fewer than  <dig> diagnostic differences  <cit> .

sequences from the coi dna barcode region indicated a clear subdivision that was corroborated with two nuclear genes, with haplotypes mostly confined to each clade, except for one allele in the more slowly evolving nuclear gene ptpn <dig>  the most likely explanation in this case is retention of ancestral polymorphism but not recent hybridization, as no other allele was shared in the faster evolving adh intron or coi. the use of multiple genes not only increased the support for species delimitation, but it also provided more information to improve the precision of the coalescent estimates of divergence time and assessment of the degree of genetic isolation. coalescent analysis suggested that divergence with little or no gene flow occurred between the two groups in the middle pleistocene. these observations are in accordance with morphological differences between brown-cheeked rails and water rails observed in comprehensive sampling of museum skins. eastern birds are sexually monomorphic in size, have proportionally larger dimensions, pinkish cinnamon and pale buff chin and throat-feathers, longer neck and breast feathers, and black-and-white-barred under-tail coverts  <cit> . additionally, the two forms have different call types: the complex call of the brown-cheeked rail has a lower pitched growl and a distinctly shorter duration than in the water rail, which seems to have biological significance due the lack of response to each other's calls in playback experiments  <cit>  .

trait variation observed between adults of the water rail and brown-cheeked rail  <cit> .

a unified species concept suggests treating independently evolving metapopulation lineages as different species, if independent lines of evidence are available to support their reciprocal isolation  <cit> . hence, we support raising the brown-cheeked rail to full species status, rallus indicus, since genetic evidence and differences in morphology and vocalizations indicate this lineage is evolving independently from populations of the water rail .

vicariance and biogeography
according to our analysis the brown-cheeked rails and water rails diverged with little or no gene flow about  <dig>  years ago, and thus fit a model of allopatric speciation where a geographic barrier prevented contact between the two groups. prior to this the fossil record indicates that water rails were widespread in eurasia including japan from at least the beginning of the pleistocene . by the end of the pliocene, the climate was considerably different from that of today, coniferous forests covered much of the modern tundra zone, and grasslands extended into mid- and low-latitudes  <cit> . the distribution of wetlands in this moister climate was likely more continuous, and the dispersal of water rails in eurasia could have occurred via multiple routes.

the pleistocene was marked by repeated glacial cycles  <cit>  that at their maxima would have prevented passage of several populations through siberia, and around high mountain chains due to the higher extension of permafrost  <cit> . the glaciers also would have tied up a considerable volume of water, reducing precipitation and contributing to the extension of asian deserts such as the taklamakan and gobi, consistent with records in loess deposits in china and tajikistan  <cit> . the continuous uplift of the himalayan mountain chain, which doubled its height during the period, was not only a barrier on its own, but is also believed to have contributed to the extension of the arid areas by creating a barrier for the monsoon winds  <cit> . these events limited the availability of wetlands, and likely forced water rails south to less continuous wetland environments east and west of the arid spots. fragmentation of the widespread ancestral population and eventual speciation of water rails is thus attributable to this vicariance event. currently, brown-cheeked rail and water rail populations are isolated on opposite sides of the yablonovy, stanovoy and himalaya mountain chains, the mongolian steppes, and the gobi desert  <cit> .

lack of population structure within species
despite the sparse sampling across their range in eurasia, we did not detect obvious structuring of breeding populations of the water rail from europe, west siberia and kazakhstan. this supports lumping of r. a. aquaticus from europe and west and middle siberia with the disjunct population of r. a. korejewi from kazakhstan in one subspecies, consistent with their lack of morphological differentiation  <cit> . water rails are known to have an erratic migration pattern, and good flight capabilities, which could allow them to fly long distances to find alternative shallow water habitats in times of instability  <cit> . long distance gene flow could explain lack of population structure in birds from the west. however, low frequency haplotypes in coi are not shared between different breeding populations, indicating that interpopulation gene flow is not extensive enough to spread these more recently evolved mutant alleles. a star-burst distribution of haplotypes in the water rail lineages  suggests a population contraction occurred, which would tend to erase less frequent haplotypes, and then the population expanded in size  <cit> . using  <dig>  years ago time of divergence of the two species as a calibration in the species tree estimated with *beast, we dated the expansion of the populations in both species at approximately  <dig>  years ago. this recent expansion was likely from a refugial population that survived the last glacial maximum. these hypotheses need to be addressed in the future with more extensive sampling of individuals and more rapidly evolving nuclear loci.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis with three genetic markers is consistent with morphological and call differences that collectively support suggestions that the water rail is divisible into two species, the brown-cheeked rail , including breeding populations of east asia, and the water rail , including populations from west asia and europe. these lineages were estimated to have split in the middle pleistocene  when wetlands became more disjunct, restricting gene flow and eventually isolating them in allopatric populations.
