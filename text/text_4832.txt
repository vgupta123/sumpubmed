BACKGROUND
the intestinal epithelium forms a relatively impermeable barrier between the lumen and the submucosa. this barrier function is maintained by a complex of proteins composing the tight junction  that is located at the subapical aspect of the lateral membranes. the tight junctional complex comprises a large number of membrane-associated and membrane proteins, the latter including occludin, junction adhesion molecule , and claudins  <cit> , which are responsible for forming the physical connections between cells that confer the basic barrier properties. these proteins are considered to be involved in the regulation of paracellular permeability. the tj effect can be documented by reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance . some bacterial pathogens manipulate the apical-junctional complex from the apical surface. the cellular cascade induced in enteropathogenic escherichia coli  infection, which leads to decrease in ter, is not well understood. one such strategy is to target the regulatory elements of the actin cytoskeleton. epec infects the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells and modifies the actin cytoskeleton by forming actin-rich pedestals beneath the attached bacteria, firmly anchoring the bacterium to the host cell  <cit> . changes in the host cell actin cytoskeleton could lead to a loss of absorptive surfaces in intestinal epithelial cells and account for the persistent diarrhea often associated with epec infection. control of perijunctional actin may be also the final effector mechanism in modulating paracellular permeability  <cit> .

it is increasingly recognized that lactobacillus plantarum  has the ability to protect against epec-induced damage of the epithelial monolayer barrier function by preventing changes in host cell morphology, attaching/effacing  lesion formation, monolayer resistance, and macromolecular permeability  <cit> . in recent years, moorthy g et al  <cit>  evaluated the effect of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus on the maintenance of intestinal membrane integrity during s. dysenteriae 1-induced diarrhea in rats. they found that induced rats showed a significant reduction in the membrane-bound atpases and reduced expression of tj proteins in the membrane, coupled with their increased expression in the cytosol, indicating membrane damage. transmission electron microscopic studies correlated with biochemical parameters. pretreatment with combination of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus significantly prevented these changes. however, the cellular mechanism involved in this protective effect still remained to be clarified.

the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of the l. plantarum. moreover, as infections with enteroinvasive escherichia coli  were accompanied by the disruption of epithelial integrity was also asked whether the presence of l. plantarum would influence the otherwise deleterious barrier disruption of caco- <dig> cells caused by eiec bacteria. the permeability, the distribution and expression of tight junction proteins  and the cytoskeleton were examined when infected with eiec or adhesived of l. plantarum after infection.

RESULTS
l. plantarum attenuates eiec-induced decrease in ter of caco- <dig> cells
one complementary polarized epithelial cell lines  was used to assess barrier function in response to eiec infection in the absence or presence of l. plantarum. ter of caco- <dig> monolayers were maintained  <dig> Ω·cm <dig> after being cultured for  <dig> days. this was in contrast to caco- <dig> cells infected with eiec which resulted in an approximately  <dig> % decrease of ter from  <dig> Ω·cm <dig> to  <dig> Ω·cm <dig>  however, when caco- <dig> cells were co-incubated simultaneously with eiec and l. plantarum, the reduction of ter was  <dig> % from  <dig> Ω·cm <dig> to  <dig> Ω·cm <dig>  the caco- <dig> cells infected with eiec induced to a substantial decrease of ter to  <dig> % of the control values within  <dig> h .

l. plantarum inhibits increases in macromolecular permeability of caco- <dig> cells in response to eiec infection
macromolecular permeability assays with caco- <dig> cell monolayers using an infraredsensitive dextran  probe  from apical to basolateral transwell compartments  demonstrated that eiec-infected monolayers exhibited a marked increase in the permeability to the dextran probe  as compared with control group and l. plantarum group , p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig> , respectively. eiec-induced increases in the dextran permeability of caco- <dig> cell monolayers were reduced when epithelial cells were treated with l. plantarum, p <  <dig>  .

l. plantarum prevents eiec-induced redistribution of claudin- <dig>  occludin, jam- <dig> and zo- <dig> proteins
tj barrier function can also be affected by changes in the distribution of specific tight junctional proteins or their levels of expression. tj were located between the adjacent caco- <dig> cells, tjs associated proteins were continuously distributed with bright brown spots along membrane of the cells. the claudin- <dig>  occludin, jam- <dig> were located the outer of the membrane, zo- <dig> protein was distributed in the cytoplasmic, their borders were very clear in the control group. in the caco- <dig> infected with eiec, the expression of tjs associated-protein were decreased and the degradation developed in the eiec group. in the co-incubation with l. plantarum, the brown spots distribution were decreased compared with control group, however, its expression were better than in eiec group .

l. plantarum prevents eiec-induced expression of claudin- <dig>  occludin, jam- <dig> and zo- <dig> proteins
western blot analyses were performed to determine the relative protein expression of ocludin, claudin, jam- <dig> and zo- <dig> in caco- <dig> cells after treatment with eiec and with l. plantarum. the intensity measurements for whole-cell proteins were determined from the ratio of the integrated intensity of the ocludin, claudin, jam- <dig> and zo- <dig> band to the integrated intensity of the β-actin band in the same sample. western blotting of epithelial whole-cell protein extracts showed that tj proteins expression were reduced in eiec-infected cells compared to control group, p <  <dig> . there were increased of the tj proteins expression density in l. plantarum group as compared with eiec group, p <  <dig>  .

l. plantarum prevents eiec-induced rearrangements of claudin- <dig>  occludin , jam- <dig> and zo- <dig> proteins
confocal imaging was also performed to assess distribution of the tjs after exposure to eiec. tj associated proteins were continuously distributed with bright green spots along membrane of the cells. the claudin- <dig>  occludin, jam- <dig> were located the outer of the membrane, zo- <dig> protein was distributed in the cytoplasmic, their borders were very clear in the control group. in the control caco- <dig> intestinal monolayers, both zo- <dig> and occludin were present at the apical intercellular borders in a belt-like manner, encircling the cells and delineating the cellular borders. in the infected caco- <dig>  the green fluorescence were dispersedly distributed, and occludin staining became punctate with some loss from the membrane as opposed to the uniform membrane staining in controls. in the co-incubation with l. plantarum, the green spots distribution were decreased compared with control group, however its expression were better than in eiec group .

l. plantarum prevents eiec-induced rearrangements of the epithelial cell cytoskeleton elements f-actin
to examine whether the barrier disruption is associated with redistribution of actin, f-actin staining with fitc-labelled phalloidin was carried out in the study. in the following studies, the possible involvement of cytoskeletal elements actin and the effect of l. plantarum on actin were visualized by fluorescent labeling of these structures. the staining pattern of control caco- <dig> cells showed a continuous lined distributing at the cell borders and cytoskeletal. a high density of actin filaments was present at the apical peri-junctional regions and encircled the cells in a belt-like manner. in contrast, the type of the actin architecture in eiec group showed disorganized and disrupted. the incubation of caco- <dig> monolayers infected with eiec resulted in a centripetal retraction of the peri-junctional actin filaments with separation of actins from the apical cellular borders. the eiec-induced alteration of peri-junctional actin filaments was reversed by the re-introduction of l. plantarum .

discussion
although many clinical studies have reported that probiotics, such as l. plantarum, have beneficial health effects  <cit> , it is still difficult to ascertain their direct mechanism of action. therefore, the current trend in research in this field is to determine the mechanisms by probiotic are efficacious in treating specific gut abnormalities or protect against defined microbial infections  <cit> .

probiotics are reported to exert their beneficial effects by producing bacteriostatic or bactericidal agents  <cit> , competitively excluding pathogenic bacteria  <cit> , or regulating immunomodulatory effects  <cit> . johnson-henry kc et al  <cit>  reported that with probiotic pretreatment there was corresponding attenuation of the enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  o157:h7-induced drop in electrical resistance and the increase in barrier permeability assays. l. rhamnosus gg protected epithelial monolayers against ehec-induced redistribution of the claudin- <dig> and zo- <dig> tj proteins. resta-lenert s et al  <cit>  hypothesized that probiotics and/or commensals could also reverse epithelial damage produced by cytokines. they found that deleterious effects of tnf-α and ifn-γ on epithelial function were prevented by probiotic, and to a lesser extent, commensal pretreatment. a janus kinase  inhibitor synergistically potentiated effects of streptococcus thermophilus /lactobacillus acidophilus  or bacteroides thetaiotaomicron  on ter and permeability, but p <dig>  erk <dig>   <dig>  or pi3k inhibition did not. finally, only probiotic-treated epithelial cells exposed to cytokines showed reduced activation of socs <dig> and stat <dig> . these data extended the spectrum of effects of such bacteria on intestinal epithelial function and may justify their use in inflammatory disorders. in addition, seth a et al  <cit>  evaluated the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg-produced soluble proteins  on the hydrogen peroxide-induced disruption of tj and barrier function in caco- <dig> cell monolayers. pretreatment of cell monolayers with p <dig> or p <dig> attenuated the hydrogen peroxide-induced decrease in ter and increased in inulin permeability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. p <dig> and p <dig> also prevented hydrogen peroxide-induced redistribution of occludin, zo- <dig>  e-cadherin, and beta-catenin from the intercellular junctions and their dissociation from the detergent-insoluble fractions. both p <dig> and p <dig> induced a rapid increased in the membrane translocation of pkcbetai and pkcepsilon. the attenuation of hydrogen peroxide-induced inulin permeability and redistribution of tj proteins by p <dig> and p <dig> was abrogated by ro-32- <dig>  a pkc inhibitor. p <dig> and p <dig> also rapidly increased the levels of phospho-erk1/ <dig> in the detergent-insoluble fractions. u <dig>  attenuated the p40- and p75-mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide-induced tj disruption and inulin permeability. these studies demonstrated that probiotic-secretory proteins protected the intestinal epithelial tjs and the barrier function from hydrogen peroxide-induced insult by a pkc- and map kinase-dependent mechanism.

this study broadens our current understanding of how probiotics exert their beneficial effects and emphasizes the ability of l. plantarum  to protect polarized epithelial cells against the effects of e. coli-induced changes in barrier function. this study demonstrated that eiec  disrupted epithelial tj structure, including claudin- <dig>  occludin, jam- <dig>  and zo- <dig> distribution in caco- <dig> culture cells, resulted in decreased ter and increased permeability to macromolecules. infection models used by other investigators demonstrated that both probiotic mixtures  and additional single strains  prevented zo- <dig> redistribution in response to salmonella enterica serovar dublin and enteropathogenic e. coli infections in vitro  <cit> . in our study, l. plantarum ameliorated the pathogen-induced redistribution of claudin- <dig>  occludin, jam- <dig>  and zo- <dig>  we also demonstrated, for the first time, using confocal laser scanning microscopy, that l. plantarum treatment stabilized cellular tjs, thereby prevented eiec -induced redistribution of the integral tj proteins.

to support microscopy observations, we also employed western blotting techniques to determine levels of claudin- <dig>  occludin, jam- <dig>  and zo- <dig>  in contrast to eiec infections, co-incubation with l. plantarum resulted in a close association of the tj proteins with the cytoskeleton and a concentration of these proteins at the cellular contact sites that is known to stabilize tj structures and helps to maintain the cell morphology of caco- <dig>  in addition, we found that l. plantarum leaded to an increase expression of these proteins as had been shown by immunofluorescence and western blotting experiments. these results demonstrated that the amount and localization of these tj proteins appeared to be crucial for the beneficial effects of l. plantarum. interestingly, co-incubation experiments of caco- <dig> cells with both l. plantarum and eiec simultaneously demonstrated that l. plantarum abrogated the detrimental effects of eiec. when compared with the probiotic effect of lactobacillus acidophilus  investigated in a previous study by resta-lenert and barrett  <cit>  that showed that only the pretreatment but not the simultaneous exposure of epithelial cells with l. acidophilus prevents the invasion of an enteroinvasive e. coli strain , this demonstrated an extended activity of the probiotic ecn. in addition, our study showed that l. plantarum maintained the structure and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, reversed the eiec which leaded the f-actin cytoskeleton injury. a significant improvement in permeability was accompanied by disruption of the perijunctional f-actin.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we expanded findings of previous investigators by demonstrating that l. plantarum treatment interrupted the infectious processes of eiec. by demonstrating the mode of action of this probiotic strain in attenuating eiec infection, we expanded our knowledge regarding the protective contributions of this probiotic bacterium when it is cultured with epithelial cells. accordingly, it is important to better define how individual probiotics elicit their beneficial effects as biotherapeutic agents against pathogen-induced disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.
