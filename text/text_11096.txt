BACKGROUND
the human intestinal tract is colonized since birth by a large number of microbes, together making a complex ecosystem, even considered an organ by itself  <cit> . many studies indicate a pivotal role for the intestinal microbes in carbohydrate metabolism, production of vitamins, inflammatory response regulation, fat metabolism and other biological processes of the human host  <cit> . in adults, the community consists of around  <dig> cells  <cit> , with a complexity that is predicted to include over  <dig> microbial species  <cit> . while recent progress has been made in characterizing the genomes of around  <dig> intestinal species in the human microbiome project   <cit> , the vast majority has not yet been cultured. hence, these are known as phylotypes as their presence can be deduced from molecular markers such as 16s rrna and other nucleotide sequences. this approach has shown that most of the intestinal phylotypes belong to a limited set of phyla, including the firmicutes, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia  <cit> . in healthy adults the intestinal microbiota fluctuates around a stable individual core of phylotypes that are affected by host genetics, environmental and stochastic factors  <cit> . high throughput metagenomics studies, such as that of the recently reported metahit project, have indicated that the human gut microbiome contains a gene repository that is estimated to be over  <dig> times the number of genes encoded by the human genome  <cit> .

the current developments in high-throughput omics techniques allow for unique insight in the functions of this community that can be predicted via metagenomics and established at the biochemical level. proteomics of isolated microbes is an established and powerful method to determine global expression profiles  <cit> . however, metaproteomics i.e studying the proteome of a complex environmental system like the human intestinal microbiota is an emerging field within the area of proteomics that is characterized by a high level of complexity  <cit> . common high-throughput spectral interpretation algorithms use peptide spectrum matching to link the raw data obtained from a mass spectrometer to large listings of peptides that are possibly represented in the data. generation of theoretical spectra from these peptides present in the database and matching them with the obtained data forms the basis of these algorithms  <cit> . thus, in order to properly identify the spectra, one needs to know very accurately which peptides one can expect. the complex gut microbial proteome is, however, far from defined, as the hmp is still advancing  <cit> . moreover, the distribution of species is dynamic and it differs between individuals  <cit> . a common method to circumvent the lack of a defined proteome is to use proteomes from closely related species in so-called cross-species protein identification. this is reported to lead to relatively high false discovery rates however, and should be considered a sub-optimal solution  <cit> . another approach is to exploit the metagenomics developments but this approach suffers from the limited coverage of the present databases. an ideal case is the use of available sequence data of the sample that is to be analyzed by metaproteomics. this matched metagenome could serve as a basis for the predicted metaproteome by naive six-frame translation and basic filtering of the obtained hypothetical proteins for the presence of trypsinated peptides of sufficient size. since most of the predictions will be incorrect as it fills the search space with noise, this approach may also either suffer from a high false discovery rate or results in a low proteomics identification efficiency.

since both approaches suffer from unacceptable high-false positive rates, which lead to low accuracy in the identification of proteins, we aimed to develop an iterative workflow based on a synthetic metagenome from over  <dig> intestinal species that would increase the sensitivity of peptide identification by peptide spectrum matching of the metaproteomics data. synthetic metagenomes have already been successfully applied in the analysis of less complex microbial proteomes,  <cit>  and biofilms, reviewed in  <cit>  and recently in the analysis of biostimulated microbial communities from field experiments  <cit> . for the complex microbial proteome of fecal samples verberkmoes et al.,  <cit>  successfully used a mixture of gut microbial metagenome sequence data supplemented with a synthetic metagenome constructed from known gut inhabitants representatives. the human gut microbial gene catalogue  <cit>  is however increasing exponentially and thus there is need for alternative approaches that keep the false discovery rate within limits while still maintaining high proteomics identification efficiency.

in this study a synthetic metagenome setup is used as a starting point in an iterative approach. this approach combines the power of sequence diversity contained in metagenomic diversity while keeping the reliability of predicted proteins high and hence the search space small, which limits false discovery rates. to provide proof of concept for this approach, we determined the metaproteomes of two fecal samples from healthy adults that had also been characterized by metagenomic sequence analysis.

RESULTS
to develop the iterative workflow for identifying mass spectrometric data from the intestinal metaproteome, we first assembled a synthetic metagenome. this was done by selecting a set of genomes from  <dig> known gut inhabitants that were available, fully sequenced, and annotated  <cit>  . subsequently, we collected a metaproteomics dataset from fecal samples from two french healthy subjects, termed no <dig> and no <dig>  which had been analyzed by metagenome sequencing. finally, we benchmarked the developed iterative workflow by comparing the predictions obtained with other search strategies.

phylogenetic analysis of two human metagenomic datasets
the two matched metagenomes from the subjects no <dig> and no <dig> were determined by high fidelity sanger sequence analysis and contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequence trace files respectively, giving in total  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides per metagenome. the phylogenetic diversity of these samples was determined by 16s rrna sequence analysis of the metagenomic data sets . this was compared to an abundance analysis of the metagenomic sequences using the synthetic metagenome as reference set . the results indicate the presence of bacteroidetes, firmicutes, actinobacteria, verrucomicrobia and proteobacteria as the dominant phylotypes in these gut samples . moreover, the high congruency between the different approaches testifies for the representativeness of the synthetic metagenome used in this study.

both phylogenetic analysis methods  revealed significant difference between the two samples in abundance of actinobacteria, proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia and both methods suggest that the verrucomicrobia are more present in the no <dig> sample. remarkably, based on the abundance analysis of the metagenomic sequence trace files the verrucomicrobia were highly prominent in the no <dig> sample . the metagenomic sequence trace files from this group all seem to originate from akkermansia muciniphila-like species. a. muciniphila is a common bacterial component of the human intestinal tract and is reported to reach densities up to approximately 3% in the human colon  <cit> . it is unlikely that the discrepancy between the direct diversity analysis and the metagenome mining results derived from inappropriate annotation of the metagenome information, as a. muciniphila belongs to the verrucomicrobia, which is a deeply rooted phylum, and changing the cut-off values for the average nucleotide identity from  <dig> to 95% still predicted 6% abundance of a. muciniphila-like bacteria . hence we assumed that this discrepancy is a result of a cloning bias of the 16s rrna versus genomic fragments of the a. muciniphila-like bacteria. such cloning biases have recently been reported in a model study comparing different metagenomic sequencing approaches  <cit> .

metaproteomics data collection and its analysis using naive translations of the matched metagenomes
proteins extracted from the microbial fractions isolated from the fecal samples of subjects no <dig> and no <dig> were separated by 1-d sds-page followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  analysis of trypsin-treated gel fractions. this resulted in the collection of a set of  <dig> and  <dig> ms/ms spectra in the no <dig> and no <dig> samples respectively. six-frame naive translations were made from the matched no <dig> and no <dig> metagenomes, filtering out small peptides. peptide spectral matching  was performed on the ms/ms data using the no <dig> and no <dig> naively translated metagenomes as single search spaces. false positives were determined using reversed versions of each database  <cit>  and the results of all psm analyses are reported at a fixed peptide false discovery rate  of 1%. the peptide search against the matched metagenomes resulted in  <dig>  peptide hits for no <dig> and  <dig>  peptide hits for no <dig> . moreover, the search against the un-matched metagenomes resulted in only  <dig>  and  <dig> peptide hits for the no <dig> and no <dig> metaproteomes, respectively . remarkably, the use of the matched metagenome resulted in a more than two fold increased number of identified ms/ms spectra compared to the un-matched metagenome, demonstrating the importance of using a search database where the listed sequences precisely match the peptides present in the sample. however, the number of peptides present might be even under-estimated when using the naive translations as search space as these have the drawback that the pseudogenes vastly outnumber true genes. this results in a large number of false positives that only can be eliminated by increasing the threshold and hence limiting the discovery success. therefore, an alternative approach was developed based on an iterative analysis of the metaproteome data using a synthetic metagenome database as described below.

development of an iterated search method using a synthetic metagenomic data set
as indicated above, a representative synthetic metagenome data set was constructed and used for developing an improved method for metaproteomics data analysis.

the sequence variability present in the predicted synthetic proteome cannot be fully covered, as the species diversity of the intestinal microbiota is enormous. moreover, in the analysis of shotgun proteomics data with psm algorithms, an exact match between the experimental data and a theoretical spectrum from a theoretical peptide from the database is necessary. peptides containing a single amino acid polymorphism are not detected if they are not contained in the database. to circumvent this limitation, it is necessary to cover the sequence variability of the proteins in the sample. with the release of sequence repositories from the high throughput metagenomic studies, such as the metahit project, an enormous amount of gut metagenome data is available  <cit> . these repositories are increasing in size and hence difficult to use directly in a naive translation approach as their complexity is increasing exponentially. furthermore, faithful annotation of the data is hampered by the inability to efficiently transform sequence data completely into contigs of sufficient length that capture complete protein encoding genes  <cit> . moreover, there is no way to deal with the inevitable occurring sequencing errors associated with the new generation technology sequencing approaches  <cit> . furthermore, standard methods of fdr calculation using decoy databases derived from search databases of this size are increasingly impractical, notably as the computing time is limiting. the iterative workflow we propose here is based on a combination of the synthetic metagenome described above and a metagenome repository without any form of assembly, annotation or a priori translation . we selected the metahit dataset as a basis as this is by far the most comprehensive analysis to date  <cit> . it is evident that the synthetic metagenome selected here may be increased in size as the hmp is continuously progressing.

b: alignment of naive translations of selected traces with a synthetic metagenome starting sequence assigned to cog <dig>  underlined: domains of the synthetic metagenome starting sequence; red: peptides spectrum matches using the synthetic metagenome peptide database; blue: variant peptides detected in selected naively translated metahit sequence trace files. leucine  and isoleucine  are isobaric and can therefore not be detected separately.

psm analysis of the ms/ms data is performed in a first step using the synthetic metaproteome. since these genomes are reliably annotated, we are able to use the dna gene-sequences coding for the peptides identified in the first psm run to retrieve homologous sequence trace files from the metahit repository. to reduce the computational load this enrichment procedure is done in two steps . the first step using discontiguous megablast with coding spaced seeds  <cit>  performs a first selection of these sequence trace files at dna level. the second step using blastx performs a comparison of this selection on amino-acid level, thus ensuring homology between the protein sequence from the synthetic metagenome selected by the initial peptide spectrum match and the metahit sequence trace file on peptide level. next the selected sequence trace file is translated and recorded in a new peptide database. these new peptide databases are created for each individual ms data sample. the databases are then used for a next round of psm analysis.

application of this iterative search workflow showed an increase in spectral identifications when compared to that obtained with the synthetic metagenome and the earlier described matched metagenome searches. the iterative method resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  identified peptides in the no <dig> and no <dig> samples, respectively. compared to each of the two other methods, this represents an approximately 2-fold increase . an important factor contributing to the increased number of identifications is the increase in sensitivity of the iterative method compared to a direct synthetic metaproteome approach. the sequence trace files enable the psm algorithms to search the data using a broad sequence variability. . another factor is the increase in specificity of the enrichment procedure with respect to a naive translation approach. as the number of incorrectly predicted proteins is drastically reduced by the method of sequence trace file selection before they are translated, the fdr is also drastically reduced.

the open mass spectrometry search algorithm  search against the matched metagenomes resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> identified peptides for no <dig> and no <dig> respectively which could not be identified by the iterative search approach. these hits are peptides, which do not have an apparent homolog in the synthetic metagenome. however, this loss of information can be taken into account as in a standard experiment a matched metagenome is not available.

the enrichment procedure also minimizes the impact of an initial false discovery. sequence trace files selected by a true peptide match will in turn produce additional psms  and thus increase the relative weight of the presence of particular molecular function in a matched gut metaproteome. trace sequence files selected by a random hit generally will not produce additional psms for the same molecular function. these concepts together contribute to the accuracy of the method and the increased number of identified spectra. moreover, as the size of protein sequence databases is constantly growing, the success of the identifications is expected to increase accordingly using the described iterative method that accommodates the dynamics in database development.

molecular function prediction of the metaproteomics data
to illustrate the power of the described metaproteomic approach in combination with the iterative search method, we predicted the functions of the intestinal microbiota isolated from the subjects no <dig> and no <dig>  for this purpose we performed a blast search of the trace hit sequences against the cog clusters of orthologous proteins of comparable molecular function  <cit>  database  and assigned a cog to each identified spectrum. molecular function abundance estimates were determined by summing the cogs over all spectral counts and grouping cogs into cog families . the iterative search method resulted in a similar distribution over the cog families as that obtained with the synthetic metaproteome-search method, reflecting the approach taken . remarkably, the distribution over the cog families between the no <dig> and no <dig> samples is highly similar. the cog categories translation, energy production and conversion and carbohydrate transport and metabolism count for over 50% of the spectra in each sample. furthermore, cog categories amino acid transport and metabolism, nucleotide transport and metabolism and lipid transport and metabolism are abundantly present. a similar distribution of cog families based on metaproteomes was recently reported for a swedish adult twin pair  <cit> . it reassures the role of the gut microbiota in carbohydrate metabolism and harvesting and conversion of other nutrients. moreover, the elucidation of the full range of microbial functions allows studies to gain insight in the relation between gut microbial community and obesity or other inflammatory disorders.

metaproteomic mining points to a specific role of a. muciniphila-like bacteria in the intestinal tract
the identified metaproteome can also be used to focus on the proteome of phylogenetically deeply rooted microbial taxa as these stand out in the blast analyses. an example is a. muciniphila-like bacteria that is a single intestinal representantative of the deeply rooted verrucomicrobia and has recently been characterized at the genome level . the traces from the metahit pool selected by a psm were phylogenetically analyzed by a meta-mining approach for the relative presence of proteins derived from a. municiphilia-like bacteria. this resulted in the detection of a total of  <dig> such proteins in the no <dig> metaproteome while close to  <dig> of such proteins were found in the no <dig> metaproteome . this reflects accurately the observed abundance of a. muciniphila-like bacteria in the different metagenome datasets . close inspection of the large dataset from the no <dig> subject shows a specific cog distribution of the peptides derived from a. muciniphila-like bacteria . apart from the obvious housekeeping functions, the largest cog groups included proteins predicted to be involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism as well as amino acid transport and metabolism. this is compatible with the observation that a. muciniphila is capable of using mucin as carbon and nitrogen source  <cit> .

moreover, as these proteins include various mucinases, it testifies for predicted activity and function of a. muciniphila-like bacteria in the intestinal tract.

CONCLUSIONS
the wealth of information contained in the intestinal metaproteomes becomes increasingly accessible as technical and analytical methods for its analysis mature. although there are still limitations in peptide identification, we describe here a novel approach that increases the accuracy of peptide identification from shotgun proteomics data significantly. the setup of the iterative workflow is highly dynamic, which allows capitalizing on the developing databases. moreover, it is sufficiently general to make it applicable to study metaproteomes of other ecosystems. the developed iterative workflow was benchmarked to other approaches using data from two human intestinal metaproteomes, showing superior identifcation power and its applicability in defining functions of intestinal bacteria.

liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric analysis
bacteria were separated from fresh fecal material from subjects no <dig> and no <dig> by flotation in a preformed nycodenz continuous gradient adapted from  <cit>  and stored at -80°c. proteins were extracted from bacterial pellets by chemical lysis. freshly prepared buffer containing  <dig>  m urea ,  <dig>  m thiourea , 5%  chaps ,  <dig> mm dtt  and  <dig>  mm dihydrate spermine base  was added to each frozen bacterial pellet. the pellets were dispersed by vigorous vortexing and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> h with periodic vortexing. the lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> h at 18°c. protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the ge healthcare 2-d quant kit. after neutralizing with concentrated hcl, the protein solutions were stored at -80°c.

protein solutions were buffer exchanged and per sample  <dig> μg of proteins were fractionated on a 4-12% gradient gel and lanes fractionated into  <dig> pieces. proteins were reduced with  <dig> mm  in  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate  for  <dig> h at 60°c, alkylated with  <dig> mm iodoacetamide  in  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> for  <dig> h at room temperature and digested with  <dig>  μg trypsin per gel piece at room temperature over night. peptide solutions were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to ph  <dig> and centrifuged.  <dig> μl of supernatant were loaded on a  <dig> × <dig> mm reversed phase column and peptides were eluted to an  <dig> × <dig> mm analytical reversed phase column with an acetonitrile gradient from  <dig> to 34% and a fixed concentration of formic acid in  <dig> minutes . the eluent was subjected to an electrospray potential via a coupled platinum electrode. ms spectra were measured on an orbitrap  and msms scans of four most abundant peaks were recorded in data-dependent mode in coupled ltq.

bioinformatics
synthetic metagenome/metaproteome assembly
the synthetic metaproteome and synthetic metagenome were assembled by taking the known gut inhabitants described in  <cit>  and the gut microbiota listed on the ncbi ftp server  for which both genomic information and annotated proteome information was available and  complete. selected microbial proteomes are listed in additional file  <dig> 

synthetic metaproteome redundancy minimization
all protein sequence databases have been made non-redundant , leading to lower  e-values in psm runs and shorter computational times.

abundance analysis of the metagenomic sequences
metagenomic sequence data was compared to the synthetic metagenome using 'megablast'  <cit> , with default settings. reported hits are above a 95% average nucleotide identity threshold. the synthetic metagenome allowed extraction of species to determine lineage of the metagenomic data .

metagenomic data
the pool of metagenomic traces consisted of the metahit traces found at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/tracedb/human_gut_metagenome/ .

naive translations of trace sequence data  & no <dig>  matched metagenomes)
naive translation was done in six-frames, and naive translations shorter than  <dig> amino acids or having no fully tryptic peptide of length >  <dig> amino acids were filtered out )){ <dig> }").

decoy databases
decoy databases for fdr estimation were created by reversing each individual protein sequence according to  <cit>  and tagging the deflines to aid further analysis.

peptide spectral matching
peptide spectral matching was performed for the msms spectra of each gel piece using stand-alone version  <dig> . <dig> of omssa  <cit>  with fixed modification "carbamidomethyl c" , variable modifications "oxidation of m" and "carboxymethyl c" , product mass tolerance  <dig>  da , precursor mass tolerance  <dig>   and maximum allowed e-value in hit list of  <dig>  .

fdr estimation
fdr estimation was done per sample/search database combination according to  <cit> . fdr estimation for which too few hits were generated used the score of the best false positive as threshold with upper bound omssa e-value of  <dig>  for subsequent data analysis.

iterated search method
iterated searching was done by  taking all psm hits for all respective msms data sets searched against the synthetic metagenome search with e-value <  <dig>  ,  megablasting the genomic sequences from those hits against the metagenomic pool with option "coding spaced seeds" of length  <dig>  for optimal results  <cit>  and maximum reported e-value  <dig>  . megablast output was parsed and only sequence trace files giving 50% identity over  <dig> nucleotides or better were retained for the next filtering round.  the retained trace files were compared using blastx against the protein sequences from the psm hits in . output was parsed and only trace files having 80% identity over  <dig> amino acids or better with a subject sequence were used.  the sequence trace files remaining were three-frame translated. the correct strand could be inferred from the blastx search and three-frame translation mitigates the problem of frame shifts in low-quality sequencing data. translation was followed by basic orf filtering described earlier at "naive translations". the translations were combined into a new search database used for the second psm round again using an e-value <  <dig> .

cog assignment
sequences were searched using blastp against the cog database  and assigned the cog of the best hit if the hit had an e-value better than 10- <dig>
