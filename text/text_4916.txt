BACKGROUND
the electrogenic na+/hco3--cotransporter isoform  <dig>  is basolaterally expressed in the renal proximal tubule, where it mediates hco3- reabsorption by concerted action with the apical na+/h+-exchanger isoform nhe <dig>  <cit> , and in gastrointestinal epithelia, where it serves the intracellular supply of hco3- destined for secretion  <cit> . these striking differences in function and transport direction have prompted studies to elucidate the structural and regulatory properties of the respective transporters. it was found that renal nbc is inhibited by an increase in intracellular camp  <cit> , enabling the parallel regulation with nhe <dig>  which is also inhibited in a camp-dependent manner  <cit> . in contrast, we could previously show that forskolin stimulates intestinal nbc  <cit> . however, exposure to cholinergic compounds causes an increase of both the renal and the intestinal na+/hco3- cotransporter rates  <cit> .

one explanation for the differential regulation of na+/hco3- cotransport in these tissues comes from the identification of structurally distinct splice variants of nbc <dig>  the renal  and intestinal  nbc subtypes possess a common c-terminal pka-dependent phosphorylation site , which was reported to determine transport stoichiometry in renal cells  <cit> . in addition, however, the longer n-terminal tail of pnbc <dig> contains unique phosphorylation sites for pka , pkc , and casein kinase ii , which are not found in the knbc <dig> sequence and of which at least the camp-dependent site is relevant for transporter regulation  <cit> .

on the other hand, there is increasing evidence that the cell type plays a central role in determining how ion transport is regulated  <cit> . as knowledge of intestinal na+/hco3- cotransporter function and regulation is overall limited, this important aspect has not been studied in great detail. there is only one report on camp-dependent stoichiometry changes of heterologously transfected pnbc <dig> involving the common c-terminal phosphorylation site  <cit> . however, information on cell-type dependency of intestinal nbc regulation by secretagogues during its presumed physiological function, which is hco3- uptake in the process of anion secretion  <cit> , is lacking. we therefore set off to investigate hco3- import via pnbc <dig> transfected into hek <dig> cells in acidification experiments. the aim of the study was to clarify whether regulation of heterologously transfected pnbc <dig> by secretagogues is similar as in native colonic tissue and thus essentially dependent on structural determinants of the transporter protein, or different and thus affected by the cell type in which it is expressed.

RESULTS
to determine the distribution of nbc <dig> subtypes in hek <dig> cells compared to native tissue, we first performed pcr analysis . neither pnbc <dig> nor knbc <dig> mrna was amplified from untransfected hek <dig> cells. as anticipated, pnbc1-specific primers detected a signal in hek <dig> cells transiently transfected with pnbc <dig>  and in human colon. knbc <dig> was detected in human kidney and, to a lesser degree, in human colon samples.

next, transiently transfected hek <dig> cells were visualized using confocal microscopy . the transfection efficiency was consistently at 10–15% of the cells. after selecting regions of interest  covering the major part of the cytoplasm, the image was digitized for documentation, and cells were in situ loaded with bcecf . two groups of cells were identified: cells with a strong gfp signal along the cell membrane , and cells with no or very faint fluorescence in this location . to exclude cells with intermediate gfp signal which only weakly express the transfected construct, the signal was quantified by placing a rectangular plot profile with vertical averaging over at least  <dig> pixels  perpendicularly over the cell membrane using imagej  under standardized illumination settings  <cit> . indeed, the first group of cells exhibited fluorescence intensity values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  au , and the second group values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  au ; the amount of cells with intermediate gfp signal was low , and these cells were not used for the functional experiments. cells were then subjected to an nh4+-prepulse protocol to impose an acid load in the presence of co2/hco3- . it is important to note in this context that the high phi values achieved during the prepulse are overestimated, since our calibration approach is optimized for the low phi values where transporter activity is actually measured. phi recovery upon readdition of na+ occurred faster in gfp-positive than in gfp-negative cells. since the steady-state phi appeared to be higher in transfected cells, we statistically compared the obtained values from untransfected and transfected cells, which indeed demonstrated a significantly more alkaline phi in pnbc1-transfected cells, pointing to increased basal nbc activity . the reference phi, however, was not significantly different between the two . overall, the correlation between gfp signal intensity and recovery rates were excellent, demonstrating the correct identification of the transfected cells. the resting phi and the reference phi of mock-transfected cells were equal as in untransfected cells .

to determine whether pnbc <dig> transfected in hek <dig> cells is functional, phi recovery rates were quantified in untransfected and transfected cells in the presence and absence of co2/hco3- . in hepes buffered solution, no significant difference in Δph/Δt was observed, indicating no na+/hco3--cotransport in hek <dig> cells due to the lack of substrate . the alkalization under these conditions is most likely mediated by the na+/h+-exchanger, of which the nhe <dig> and nhe <dig> isoforms are expressed in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . in the presence of co2/hco3-, however, phi recovery occurred significantly faster at a 5-fold higher rate in transfected vs. untransfected cells . this finding clearly demonstrates successful functional transfection of pnbc <dig>  Δph/Δt appeared somewhat lower in untransfected cells in the presence than in the absence of co2/hco3-, probably due to a higher buffering capacity in its presence, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. to exclude that the gfp signal significantly influences the recovery rates, control experiments using mock-transfected hek cells were carried out . here, recovery rates were generally low, and not significantly different between mock-transfected vs. untransfected in the presence and absence of co2/hco3-, respectively.

in our previous work, we had delineated the effects of secretagogues on endogenous na+/hco3--cotransport, which is most likely effectuated predominantly by the pnbc <dig> subtype of the electrogenic isoform nbc <dig>  in murine proximal colonic crypts. in accordance with the concept of nbc as an anion importer during camp-dependent and cholinergic stimulation of anion secretion, we could demonstrate transporter activation by both types of secretagogues  <cit> . we now set off to investigate the influence of the cell type on cotransporter regulation by secretagogues, and therefore studied the effect of forskolin and carbachol on pnbc <dig> transfected into hek <dig> cells as a non-intestinal cellular model. as depicted in figure 5a, an increase in intracellular camp did not significantly change phi recovery rates in untransfected cells, indicating that this measure possibly causes differential, and balanced effects on the na+/h+ exchanger isoforms expressed in hek <dig> cells  <cit>  and/or on endogenous nbc. however, forskolin stimulation significantly decreased phi recovery rate in pnbc1-transfected hek <dig> cells by more than 50%, which is in sharp contrast to the findings in native tissue  <cit> .

hek <dig> cells have been shown functionally express the m <dig> subtype of cholinergic receptors  <cit> , which mediates nbc activation by carbachol in murine colonic crypts  <cit> . when untransfected cells were subjected to cholinergic stimulation, Δph/Δt was increased compared to the control, which points to the activation of nhe <dig> which is expressed in hek <dig> cells. in pnbc1-transfected cells, however, carbachol had no additional stimulatory impact on phi recovery and did not cause changes in phi recovery altogether . given its effect on untransfected cells, carbachol does not stimulate nbc, but might even have an inhibitory effect on this transport system. this finding represents another discrepancy of endogenous intestinal versus heterologously transfected pnbc <dig> regulation  <cit> .

discussion
the renal and intestinal na+/hco3- cotransporters are differentially regulated by camp-dependent and cholinergic agonists  <cit> . possible explanations for these findings are differences in their primary structure influencing regulatory properties, or features of the cell type in which they are expressed. in this study, we investigated the secretagogue regulation of the intestinal-pancreatic nbc subtype pnbc <dig> in hek <dig> cells.

the group of ira kurtz has thoroughly studied the stoichiometry of nbc <dig> and found that the renal subtype knbc <dig> is transporting  <dig> na+ and  <dig> hco3- with each cycle, which results in outward-directed transport  <cit> . functional inhibition of knbc <dig> by camp is probably in part due to a stoichiometry shift from 3: <dig> to 2: <dig>  leading to a switch from export to import. on the other hand, the intestinal subtype pnbc <dig> serves the uptake of both ions with a 2: <dig> ratio under physiological conditions  <cit> , and a stoichiometry change was not reported for the endogenously expressed transporter. however, pnbc <dig> can be activated via camp  <cit> , which is due to the phosphorylation of a unique consensus phosphorylation site in its n-terminus  <cit> . as to a structure-function relationship regarding cholinergic stimulation, which increases the transport rate of both subtypes in a pkc-dependent manner  <cit> , the possible relevance of the unique pkc-dependent phosphorylation site in the pnbc <dig> n-terminus remains to be assessed.

importantly, cell type- and tissue-specific regulation has been recognized for many ion transporters including na+/h+-exchange  <cit> , anion exchange  <cit> , and cftr  <cit> . expression of pnbc <dig> and knbc <dig> is not restricted to the pancreas/intestinal tract and the kidney, respectively, and expression in other organs such as the eye  <cit> , the gallbladder  <cit> , and salivary glands  <cit>  has been reported, but it has not been investigated whether these different cell types modulate transporter regulation. gross et al. have previously studied the regulation of murine pnbc <dig> endogenously occurring in pancreatic duct cells and heterologously transfected into a mouse proximal tubule cell line  <cit> . they found that camp causes upregulation of endogenous pnbc <dig> via one pka-dependent phosphorylation site not present in the knbc <dig> sequence, while changing the stoichiometry from 3: <dig> to 2: <dig> and thereby transport direction via another common c-terminal site , the latter resembling knbc <dig> regulation. in our experiments, however, we sought to clarify the cell-type dependency of the regulation of the presumed physiological function of pnbc <dig>  which is hco3- uptake during stimulated anion secretion, and which can be activated by imposing an acid load on the cytosol. in this setting of inward transport, stoichiometry would be expected to be already 2: <dig>  <cit> , and there is no evidence that secretagogues can reverse it to 3: <dig> in either of the nbc <dig> subtypes. accordingly, pedrosa et al. did not find any influence of camp stimulation on knbc <dig> in renal cells in phi recovery experiments  <cit> ; however, it is under debate whether knbc <dig> can be a relevant base loader under physiological conditions, a recent study suggesting rather an adaptation of the pnbc <dig> and knbc <dig> expression pattern in renal and submandibular gland epithelia during acid-base disturbances  <cit> . the differential regulation of slc <dig> gene family members in different cell types might be related to possibly specialized roles of the transporters in the respective tissues , but this aspect of nbc function is yet poorly understood.

with respect to the hek <dig> cells used in the current study, transfection studies investigating human heart  or renal nbc did not reveal any endogenous expression of the these isoforms by immunoblotting  <cit> . in their functional experiments, one group reported na+- and hco3--dependent phi recovery after an acid load, which could be due to nhe or nbc  <cit> , while another group described no recovery in the additional presence of amiloride, arguing against the presence of endogenous nbc  <cit> . in support of these findings, the recovery rates we measured in untransfected cells in the presence of co2/hco3- were very low, and, although not statistically comparable since measured in a different experiment, not higher than in its absence. therefore, the transfection-independent recovery rate is most likely due to endogenous na+/h+ exchangers, of which the nhe <dig> and nhe <dig> isoforms have previously been detected in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . since recovery rates were considerably lower in untransfected vs. transfected cells in the presence of co2/hco3- , no attempt was made to pharmacologically inhibit the presumably relatively low endogenous transporter activities in the subsequent experiments. one limitation of the present study is therefore the lack of information on potential effects of carbachol and forskolin on endogenous base loading mechanisms.

the transfection efficiency was relatively low under all conditions we tried, e. g. serum free/serum containing media, lipophilic agents, or calcium precipitation. furthermore, a suitable transfection system to serve as a control is not available, since the intestinal cell lines caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> show endogenous nbc activities which are not well molecularly characterized  <cit> , t <dig> cells express knbc <dig> rather than pnbc <dig> , and our attempts to transfect pnbc <dig> into caco- <dig> or t <dig> cells did not yield sufficient overexpression to achieve unequivocal results. one possible reason for the overall low transfection efficiency could be that nbc increases intracellular phi above the optimum for cellular metabolism. however, the phi changes we measured were minor, and the acidification of cytosolic ph by lowering medium ph did not improve nbc abundance . more likely, transfection efficiency is limited by the large size of the gfp-pnbc <dig> transcript. to differentiate between transfected and untransfected cells in this setting, the fluorescence signal of the gfp tag was visualized using confocal microscopy. since the c-terminal phosphorylation site was characterized as a crucial regulatory sequence which explains the regulation of knbc <dig> and pnbc <dig> in renal cells  <cit> , it appeared reasonable to tag the pnbc <dig> n-terminus to avoid interference of the tag with this sequence. nevertheless, we observed an inhibition of nbc after preincubation with forskolin, which cannot be readily explained by the n-terminal gfp tag. however, we cannot exclude that the gfp tag interferes with the binding site for irbit close to the n-terminus , which could in part explain our results with carbachol.

the molecular basis for the differential regulation of pnbc in intestinal vs. hek <dig> cells remains unknown. the observed acid-induced nbc activity in hek <dig> cells under basal conditions and the strong inhibitory effect of forskolin are difficult to reconcile with mere stoichiometry changes as described by gross et al.  <cit> , since they would further increase hco3- import and thus accelerate phi recovery. possibly, the signal transduction machinery of the cell types provides an explanation. one could speculate about a possible role of associated proteins, such as nherf  family members, irbit , and carbonic anhydrase. nherf has been shown to be necessary for camp-dependent inhibition of renal nbc; however, no binding, nbc phosphorylation or change in nbc surface expression were observed  <cit> . as another regulatory protein, irbit was found to bind to pnbc <dig>  but not knbc <dig>  and pnbc <dig> transfected into x. oocytes only attains functional activity comparable to the one of transfected knbc <dig> when irbit is co-transfected  <cit> . irbit is expressed in the kidney  <cit> , while its presence in hek <dig> cells and the intestinal tract has not yet been clarified. furthermore, carbonic anhydrase, of which several isoforms are differentially expressed in the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> , could potentially influence nbc transport capacity by hco3- generation, but its functional relevance for nbc regulation is highly controversial at present  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we succeeded in functionally transfecting gfp-pnbc <dig> into hek <dig> cells, thereby providing a non-intestinal cellular model to study its regulation. na+/hco3--cotransporter response to secretagogues in this system was strikingly different from our previous findings in native murine colon. this suggests a relevance of cellular factors, possibly associated proteins, in addition to structural features of this nbc <dig> variant. the characterization of the involved molecular mechanisms requires further studies.
