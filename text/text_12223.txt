BACKGROUND
specific and high affinity antibody-antigen interactions are critical to humoral immunity. understanding antibody-antigen structure-function relationships provides basic information about molecular recognition and can aid in development of new research and therapeutic reagents  <cit> . we previously studied the interaction between the hiv- <dig> antibody d <dig> and its target  as a model system for antibody-protein recognition   <cit> . this interaction has several unique characteristics. d <dig> has very high affinity for 5-helix despite the fact that it was not evolved against this target  and the heavy and light chains are not heavily mutated relative to germline sequences  <cit> . the reported kd values of d <dig> range from  <dig> pm to  <dig> nm, depending on the measurement technique  and on the fragment   <cit> . in general, antibodies that bind proteins with high affinity contain extensively mutated  complementarity determining regions ; therefore, the lower mutation rate of d <dig> suggests that some naïve antibodies may have properties of evolved antibodies. formation of the d5-5-helix interface results in burial of >  <dig> Å <dig> of combining site surface and residues in all six cdrs are involved in direct contacts with 5-helix  <cit> . most other antibody-antigen interactions are dominated by residues in heavy chain cdrs . finally, the d <dig> heavy chain is derived from the vh1- <dig> germline segment and the hcdr <dig> and hcdr <dig> regions are identical to the germline. a striking similarity exists between the hcdr2-dominated interactions of d <dig> and those of another vh1- <dig> antibody, cr <dig>  which targets influenza ha   <cit> . the hcdr <dig> sequence and backbone conformations are highly similar, and in both cases the critical feature of the recognition involves insertion of f <dig>  into a hydrophobic cleft on the antigen  <cit> . interestingly, while the hcdr <dig> regions are highly similar between both antibodies, an s30r mutation in cr <dig> was shown to be a specificity determinant in its interaction with ha  <cit> . these results suggest that, while the hydrophobic hcdr <dig> may serve as a critical anchor point to engage in antigen recognition, other regions could play an important role in specificity determination. we previously reported that light chain contacts in d <dig> play an important role in affinity for 5-helix  <cit> .

a growing body of work has deciphered the rules for molecular recognition by antibodies and other immunoglobulin-like scaffolds. recent efforts have focused on developing libraries containing restricted diversity segments within the cdrs of stable heavy and light chain variable domain  frameworks  <cit> . this diversity is encoded by designed, synthetic oligonucleotides  which, when used in combination with screening by a display method , allows for identification of antibodies or antibody fragments with specificities and affinities comparable to or better than antibodies obtained from natural sources  <cit> . additionally, restricted diversity libraries permit high-throughput mutagenesis studies of combining site residues to determine which characteristics most accurately reflect the physicochemical attributes of functional antibodies  <cit> . as an example, libraries in which residues at the cdrs are allowed to vary among subsets of amino acids  yield high affinity and specific binders in the context of regular immunoglobulin scaffolds and single-domain variants  <cit> . these results highlight the versatility of the immunoglobulin scaffold for molecular recognition.

here we examine the factors that contribute to affinity and specificity of d <dig> by phage display using 5-helix as a model antigen. the germline-encoded hcdr <dig> is believed to represent a critical feature of vh1- <dig> antibody recognition, as reflected in the apparent similarities in hcdr <dig> interactions between d <dig>  cr <dig>  and others  <cit> . therefore, we created two d5-based phage display libraries, in which the hcdr <dig> and the light chain  were allowed to vary using two different randomization schemes. we evaluated the abilities of these two libraries to specifically recognize 5-helix with high affinity. this study provide insights into aspects of antibody recognition by the vh1- <dig> germline.

RESULTS
specificity profiles of d <dig> and cr6261
given the similarity of hcdr <dig> and hcdr <dig> among d <dig>  cr <dig> and the common vh1- <dig> germline segment  <cit> , we sought to explore the degree of specificity of these two antibodies toward their native antigens. we expressed the single chain variable fragments  for both d <dig> and cr <dig> in bivalent format on the surface of m <dig> bacteriophage as a fusion to the major coat protein piii. binding was tested against both 5-helix and the cr <dig> target ha. as shown in figure 1c, both antibodies displayed high specificity toward their native antigens.

library design
we wondered to what degree the specificity and affinity in d <dig> was governed by cdrs other than hcdr <dig> and hcdr <dig> . to explore this question, we designed and produced two synthetic antibody libraries based on d <dig> . in library i , we introduced variation such that surface-exposed lcdr positions and residues in hcdr <dig> were permitted to vary in hexanomial fashion among ala, asp, ser, tyr, his and pro . synthetic antibody libraries containing binomial  or tetranomial  codon sets have been successful against many antigens in the context of other germline scaffolds  <cit> . the hexanomial scheme explored here also includes the positively-charged his and the conformationally-restricted pro.

a amino substitutions encoded by limited diversity codon sets. for lcdrs  <dig> – 3: bmt , or tailored codon sets listed in table  <dig> ; for hcdr <dig> in all libraries: dvk. nucleotide degeneracies: m = a/c, b = c/g/t, d = a/g/t, v = a/c/g, k = g/t.

b in lcdr <dig> and hcdr <dig>  the library synthesis was performed in such a manner to allow the d <dig> wt sequence as an alternative to the library sequences.

c tailored diversity codon sets used as shown in table  <dig> 

in the second library , variation in the lcdrs was designed to mimic diversity of natural antibodies derived from the vh1- <dig> germline and paired with vΚ light chains. we queried the pdb to identify antibodies with high homology to the vh1- <dig> germline segment that fulfilled three criteria:  their three-dimensional structures had been solved in complex with the antigen;  the antibody represented a product or variant of natural rearrangement ;  the sequences were unique. we compiled sequences from  <dig> total antibodies and found that  <dig> of these contained vk light chains . these antibodies target a variety of antigens , and were isolated from phage display and other sources. in general, the lcdr loop lengths among these antibodies were similar to those found in d <dig>  we examined each of the crystal structures and assessed lcdr positions for their importance in the structural paratope as gauged by surface area buried upon complex formation . we assigned a qualitative ‘contact score’  at each position based on the extent to which the residue at that position participated in structural paratopes across the datasets. in general, those positions with ‘high’ contact score contained side chains in which > 80% of the surface area was buried upon binding in three or more complexes. we determined the amino acid distribution at each position and designed restricted diversity codons to allow composition that reflected the distribution at each position or, in some cases, residues that had similar physicochemical properties to the natural distribution. at several positions, we allowed greater diversity than was observed in the structural dataset. for hcdr <dig>  we allowed variation among the  <dig> residues encoded by the dvk codon, since hcdr <dig> has a high degree of variability among all antibody scaffolds  <cit> .

a a ‘contact score’ for each position was assigned based on inspection of the antibody-antigen crystal structures in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the involvement of each residue side chain was scored based on the buried surface area upon complex formation; positions that constituted a major element of the structural paratope in multiple antibodies were ranked ‘high’.

b the amino acid identities and their observed frequency are listed. residues that were heavily involved in the interaction in at least one antibody-antigen complex are indicated with an asterix. in some cases, loops lengths were shorter than d5; these are indicated by a ‘-‘at some positions.

c nucleotide degeneracies: d = a/g/t, k = g/t, h = a/c/t, m = a/c, n = a/g/c/t, r = a/g, v = a/g/c, y = c/t.

d ‘coverage’ indicates the percentage of the naturally observed diversity that is encoded in the degenerate codon.

during synthesis of each library, we permitted ‘wt’ d <dig> side chain identity in both hcdr <dig> and lcdr <dig> by using template dna that contained wt d <dig> side chain identity at these positions. our rationale for this approach was to examine whether wt d <dig> sequences in hcdr <dig> and lcdr <dig> would be preferred to library sequences; if so, then clones containing these wt sequences should be selected over clones that contain library sequences. both libraries were produced in bivalent scfv format with  <dig> x  <dig> unique members each.

analysis of selectants
we screened both libraries for three rounds against 5-helix. a large number of clones from the round  <dig>  populations from both libraries were characterized by sequence analysis and monoclonal elisa. fifty-five of the  <dig> clones from d5-lib-i r <dig> population contained library sequences and had positive but moderate binding signals for 5-helix . furthermore, these clones displayed moderate specificity for binding to 5-helix . in contrast, selection of d5-lib-ii resulted in a r <dig> population that was dominated by library members  that had strong positive elisa signals for 5-helix , and were highly specific . the fact that a high percentage of clones from the r <dig> population of d5-lib-ii contain library sequences and that many of these had strong, positive elisa signals suggests that functional clones can be readily isolated from this library. in contrast, the lower amount of library sequences in r <dig> of d5-lib-i and the generally modest binding signals from isolated clones indicate that functional clones are less readily selectable.

the sequences of functional clones from the d5-lib-ii selection were highly diverse . interestingly, most of the hits identified contained wt d <dig> hcdr <dig> region but incorporated library sequences in all three lcdrs. in contrast, the selectants from d5-lib-i were divergent in hcdr <dig> although one clone, 6g <dig>  contained the d <dig> hcdr <dig> segment . this observation suggests that solutions to high affinity 5-helix recognition are restrictive in hcdr <dig> but permissive in the lcdrs. furthermore, the high hit-rate obtained with d5-lib-ii is striking in light of the fact that it contains a 100-fold higher degree of theoretical diversity than does d5-lib-i but was produced with an equivalent number of library members. this result suggests that the functional capacity for recognition in vh1- <dig> antibodies is enhanced with pairing of vk domains containing appropriate amino acid substitutions. these findings are in agreement with our previous work demonstrating that extended interactions among the heavy and light chains are required for 5-helix recognition by d <dig>  <cit> .

b for each clone, the raw elisa signal  is shown against both 5-helix and control proteins bsa, lactoferrin , or keyhole limpet hemocyanin . the ratio of elisa signals for 5-helix over each of the three control proteins is shown in parentheses.

c the reduction in elisa signal observed upon preincubation with free 5-helix  as a fraction of the signal observed in the absence of the competitor.

d kabat numbering for the first residue of each cdr is shown for d <dig> wt.

we used high-throughput elisas to assess specificity and affinity among the selectants. to examine specificity, we performed the phage elisa against 5-helix and two control proteins in addition to bsa: lactoferrin  and keyhole limpet hemocyanin . lf is a ubiquitous protein found in many tissues, but was not introduced in the selection  and therefore provided a good control for testing specificity against unrelated proteins. klh is known to be strongly immunogenic and is frequently employed as a carrier protein for immunogenicity and vaccination studies  <cit> . we surmised that polyspecific clones  would have reactivity with this protein; therefore cross-reactivity with klh served as another stringent measure of specificity. by determining the ratio of elisa reactivity for 5-helix over bsa, lf, or klh we could rapidly assess the specificity of each selectant in a high-throughput manner.

in addition, we performed a single-point competitive phage elisa experiment in which each phage clone was preincubated with soluble 5-helix prior to capture in an elisa well containing immobilized 5-helix. those clones with higher affinity should therefore have a higher occupancy of 5-helix in the combining site from the preincubation, hence a lower elisa signal. similar strategies have been used to assess other synthetic antibody libraries. in general, phage clones in which the elisa signal is reduced by > 50% upon preincubation of  <dig> nm or  <dig> nm free antigen results in antibodies with low or mid nanomolar dissociation constants  when the corresponding protein fabs were purified and assayed by spr  <cit> . we found that preincubation of d5-lib-ii selectants with  <dig> nm free 5-helix provided a large dynamic range of elisa signals among selectants, therefore we used this concentration to assess relative affinities for these clones. selectants from d5-lib-i were generally lower affinity and consequently necessitated a higher concentration of free 5-helix  for the competition assay. the data are represented as the fraction of elisa signal observed in the presence of the free 5-helix relative to the signal observed without competitor .

table  <dig> lists representative clones from d5-lib-i and d5-lib-ii selection along with results from specificity profile analysis and single-point competition elisa. this analysis revealed that selectants from d5-lib-ii contained varying levels of specificity for 5-helix over bsa, lf, and klh although generally the selectivity for 5-helix was strong. the ratio of elisa signals for 5-helix over each of the control protein was at least 5-fold in all cases and, for most clones, an over 10-fold ratio was observed against all three control proteins. furthermore, the affinity, as assessed by fcompetitive, was high in most cases since the  <dig> nm free 5-helix resulted in more than 50% reduction in elisa signal  for nearly all of the clones. notably, three of the clones with the best selectivity and affinity profiles  contained lcdr <dig> sequences that are identical to wt d <dig>  however, similarity to the d <dig> lcdr <dig> region was not an absolute necessity; clone 25d <dig> exhibited high affinity and specificity but contained no homology to d <dig> in the lcdr <dig> region.

selectants from d5-lib-i were generally less specific and had poor affinity. the ratio of elisa signals for 5-helix over bsa did not exceed 6-fold. furthermore, only moderate competition was observed upon addition of  <dig> nm free 5-helix in two cases . in the other two cases, no competition was observed. the results obtained with d5-lib-i and d5-lib-ii suggest that restricted diversity in the context of this interaction is insufficient to provide highly functional clones, despite the fact that sequence space in d5-lib-i is much more adequately sampled than in d5-lib-ii.

conformational specificity
antibody d <dig> inhibits hiv- <dig> infection by binding the n- and c-heptad repeat regions of gp <dig>  and sequestering a conformation known as the ‘extended intermediate’ in the gp41-mediate viral membrane fusion pathway that is required for virus entry  <cit> . the target for d <dig>  5-helix, is an engineered protein containing the nhr and chr segments designed to mimic the ‘extended intermediate’  <cit> . the critical hcdr <dig> loop of d <dig> projects into a hydrophobic cleft that should only be present in this conformational form of gp <dig>  <cit> . therefore, antibody d <dig> is predicted to exhibit conformational specificity for the gp <dig> nhr and chr – the antibody should bind mimics of the extended intermediate but not the ‘post-fusion’ form of this proteins   <cit> .

we sought to define the conformational preferences of d <dig> and the selectants from d5-lib-ii. we prepared a designed protein containing the gp <dig> nhr and chr segments which mimics the six-helix bundle ‘post-fusion’ conformation   <cit> . this protein consists of the nhr linked to the chr by a short linker, followed by a trimeric coiled-coil segment from t <dig> fibritin  to promote trimerization   <cit> . 6-helix-fd was purified from e. coli by standard procedures and found to be α-helical by circular dichroism consistent with design . to explore conformational specificity of the antibody clones, we performed competitive elisa assays in which binding to immobilized 5-helix was inhibited by binding free 5-helix or free 6-helix-fd . the ic <dig> obtained by competition with free 5-helix provides an estimate for binding activity. furthermore, the relative ic <dig> obtained by competition with 6-helix-fd enables evaluation of preference for the extended intermediate conformation over the post-fusion conformation. these results are summarized in table  <dig> .

a 95% confidence intervals from data fitting are shown in parentheses.

b nd, not determined.

cnc, no convergence observed upon data fitting, suggesting weak or insignificant binding.

we previously reported an ic <dig> of d <dig> for 5-helix of  <dig>  nm, and here we determined an ic <dig> for 6-helix-fd of  <dig> nm   <cit> . therefore, the d <dig> is able to discriminate the extended and post-fusion conformations of gp <dig> by 100-fold difference in apparent affinity. selectants from d5-lib-ii ranged in their apparent affinity for 5-helix, some were similar to d <dig>  but others had 10- or 100-fold higher ic <dig> . however, most retained their ability to distinguish 6-helix-fd from 5-helix by ~100-fold difference in apparent affinity. in one case, 25d <dig>  specificity for 5-helix over 6-helix-fd was enhanced relative to d <dig> . we have previously shown that analysis of binding to 5-helix in this format, with the antibody fragment displayed on phage, agrees well with results using the purified antibody fragment  <cit> . to further validate this assumption, we purified the scfv for d <dig> and several of the clones for binding analysis. in general, the ic <dig> obtained for the purified scfv proteins were ~10-fold higher than those observed on-phage. however, the overall trends were consistent with results on-phage for the clones examined.

positional preferences
diverse populations of phage selectants can be used to assess positional requirements for protein-protein interactions by determining the degree of conservation for a particular residue in a functional selection  relative to a selection for protein display  <cit> . in some cases, these datasets have been used to infer energetic consequences of mutation provided certain assumptions are validated  <cit> . we performed a selection of d5-lib-ii against the anti-flag antibody m <dig> to obtain a reference dataset to quantify display biases. a flag epitope sequence was included at the n-terminus of our scfv construct; therefore selection against m <dig> should provide readout of display bias. we compiled sequences for  <dig> clones from the 5-helix selection that scored well in terms of specificity profile analysis . for the reference  set, we compiled  <dig> sequences that had a strong, positive elisa signal for m <dig> binding. at each position, we determined the percentage occurrence of each residue and ranked from 1st to 4th most frequent from the functional selection. at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of lcdr <dig>  the randomization encoded variation between just two amino acids . these data are represented in table  <dig>  with the identity of the wt d <dig> residue preceding the residue number in the first column and the four most frequent residues from the functional selection listed in order of frequency. in cases where additional residues were permitted and observed, these were binned together into a fifth class, ‘other’. for each residue, we calculated the ratio between occurrence in the functional and display selections ; this analysis provide a direct evaluation of the extent to which a particular side chain is enriched in the functional  selection population over the display  selection. stronger preferences for function are indicated by both high occurrence  and f/d >  <dig>  while this analysis provides a rough guideline for identifying biases for recognition, caution must be used in analysis of these data since there is no error estimate associated with occurrence or f/d.

a for each position, the percentage of the population of analyzed clones is shown for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th most frequently observed residue from the 5-helix selection. the wt d <dig> residue is indicated prior to the position number in the first column and the “hotspot” positions identified by da silva et al. are marked by asterisk. if two of the amino acids exhibit the same frequency, the one with the higher function/display ratioc will rank in a higher order. in cases where additional substitutions were permitted and observed, these were binned into a 5th category labeled ‘other’. at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  only two residues  were permitted. the data shown here were compiled from  <dig> sequences from the 5-helix selection and  <dig> sequences from the display selection.

b amino acids shown in the four most frequently observed at each position among library members that are identical to wt d <dig> are shown in gray italic font. for positions that the wt residue was not encoded in the library due to codon degeneracy, amino acids that have the closest physiochemical properties to the wt that is among the four most frequent residues are in black italic fonts.

c ratio of percent frequency observed from functional  selection and percent frequency observed from display  selection.

nearly every position in the lcdrs exhibits specific preferences in the population for functional selection, as indicated by f/d >  <dig> for the 1st and 2nd most frequently observed residue. four positions correspond to residues in d <dig> that had high energetic cost for mutation to alanine  in our previous scanning mutagenesis experiments: y <dig>  k <dig>  y <dig>  and l <dig> . all of these positions had a preference for the most commonly-observed residue from the d5-lib-ii selection . polar and charged residues were preferred at lcdr positions  <dig> and  <dig>  despite the fact that these positions are occupied by large hydrophobes in d <dig> . we previously demonstrated that y <dig> has ΔΔgala-wt of  <dig>  kcal/mol  <cit> . therefore, variations in other portions of the lcdrs must allow for less hydrophobic residues at position  <dig>  in positions  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , the preferred residues  were not the d <dig> wt residue , despite the fact that the wt residue was included in the randomization set. in contrast, in positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of lcdr <dig>  the wt d <dig> side chain identity was preferred. this result suggests that lcdr <dig> diversity is more restrictive. tyr was highly favored in position  <dig> ; this position lies at the center of the interface and corresponds to a strong hot spot residue in d <dig> . position  <dig> in lcdr <dig>  which corresponds to another strong hot spot residue in d <dig>   <cit> , had a strong preference for cationic side chains. arg and his accounted for > 70% of the population; and arg had a f/d of  <dig> . in position  <dig>  his was preferred but this position is occupied by leu in d <dig> and is another hot spot residue .

overall, the population analysis of functionally-selected r <dig> clones suggest that there is some degree of flexibility and permissiveness for 5-helix recognition by d <dig>  but that lcdr <dig> positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> favor the wt d <dig> residues. it is somewhat surprising that hydrophobic residues, particularly tyr, were not more strongly favored at the lcdr positions in the functional selection. tyr is the most commonly observed residue in functional and naïve cdr positions and plays critical roles in recognition by natural and synthetic antibodies  <cit> . in four of the  <dig> positions examined, tyr is found at the corresponding site in d <dig> ; furthermore, tyr was permitted at these positions and seven others in d5-lib-ii but was only strongly favored at position  <dig>  in contrast, cationic or polar residues were abundant in most positions. these results suggest that lcdr contacts in this context provide polar or ionic contributions to binding, either directly or indirectly. position  <dig>  which showed the highest degree of preference for tyr, was also the residue found to have the highest ΔΔgala-wt in our previous alanine scanning studies. examination of the clones in table  <dig>  however, demonstrates that tyr at this position is not an absolute requirement – clones 25d <dig> and 25f <dig> rival d <dig> in terms of specificity and affinity yet contain polar residues at position  <dig> . however, both of these clones contained tyr at other lcdr positions.

another interesting observation is that restrictiveness in positional side chain identity for d5-lib-ii selectants against 5-helix did not correlate with ΔΔgala-wt values previously observed in d <dig>  for example, y <dig> and l <dig> of d <dig> were found to have ΔΔgala-wt ≥  <dig>  kcal/mol in the alanine scanning studies but these positions had only moderate functional preferences, and these preferences were not for the wt d <dig> side chain identities even though tyr and leu were encoded in the randomization set at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  these results match comprehensive scanning studies on the human growth hormone-receptor interaction in which ‘hot spot’ residues  correlated with some, but not all, positions that had stringent requirements for side chain identity  <cit> . furthermore, the preferred amino acids in the lcdr positions did not correlate with those most frequently observed in the analysis of the  <dig> vh1-69-related antibodies; and those positions that had the most stringent amino acid preferences were not necessarily those assigned a high contact score in the structural analysis. therefore, the functional preferences for lcdr side chain identity are likely context-dependent.

among the analyzed clones, the combining site of 25b <dig> maximizes both hydrophobic and electrostatic features given in the d5-lib-ii diversity . by our metrics, 25b <dig> scfv has a higher relative affinity compared to d <dig> . this clone contains positive charges in positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , and negative charges at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . overall, asp was not a frequent substitute in this selection; however, asp at positions  <dig> and  <dig> may enhance interaction with the positively charge residues in the n-terminal heptad repeat   <cit> . to better understand the nature of potential charged residue interactions at those positions, we used the fixedbbproteindesign module in rosetta <dig> to obtain a model of the 25b <dig> interaction with 5-helix  <cit> . the crystal structure of the d5-5-helix  and structural model of 25b <dig> are superimposed in figure  <dig>  all three arg residues in 25b <dig> have the potential to engage in favorable electrostatic interactions with 5-helix. in position  <dig>  the long carbon chain of arg in 25b <dig> acts as the edge of an overall concave surface into which the α-helices of 5-helix are nestled. this predicted interaction is similar to that of y <dig> in d <dig>  <cit> . similarly, the extended length of arg in position  <dig> and  <dig> results in the potential for formation of electrostatic interactions with e <dig> of the chr of the 5-helix. the long carbon chain of r <dig> can potentially make van der waals contact with h <dig>  on the other hand, the two asp residues that occupy position  <dig> and  <dig> can form salt bridges with, or provide electrostatic complementarity to k <dig> of 5-helix. such interactions may contribute to the high affinity interaction between 25b <dig> and 5-helix.

discussion
our high throughput analysis of selectants from d5-lib-ii indicates that the pool contained diverse clones with a variety of binding affinities. interestingly, most clones maintained their specificity at both the antigen level  and many retained conformational specificity . global sequence analysis of functional clones suggested lcdr <dig> and lcdr <dig> could accommodate many residues while lcdr <dig> was more restrictive. this may reflect biases of natural antibodies to utilize lcdr <dig> as a predominant contact region. furthermore, we previously reported that the d <dig> lcdr <dig> contains several hot spot residues  <cit> . therefore, it seems this region is important for recognition of 5-helix in multiple contexts. on a clonal level, it appears there are many recognition solutions while retaining d5-like affinity and specificity. as an example, clones 25d <dig>  25f <dig>  25b <dig>  and 25f <dig> were comparable to d <dig> by our metrics but had very different lcdr features. in particular, 25b <dig> contains arg in position  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and asp in position  <dig> and  <dig>  it is conceivable for the charged residues in the light chain enhance stability and solubility on a very hydrophobic vh antigen-binding surface; it is also reasonable to speculate that the charge residues can be used to improve overall binding interface by electrostatic complementarity.

the observation that d5-lib-i did not yield d5-like clones is surprising in light of the fact that the critical hcdr <dig> loop of the vh1- <dig> germline segment is included in these two repertoires. interactions of two hydrophobic residues  in the hcdr <dig> of cr <dig> were enough to trigger b cell activation  <cit> . and importantly, a handful of somatic hypermutations were enough to allow d <dig> to bind 5-helix in low nanomolar to high picomolar affinity. thus, inclusion of residues that have important physiochemical properties biased toward protein-protein interaction should be sufficient to yield functional clones. however, our results indicated that interactions with 5-helix using a vh1- <dig> germline clearly require extended interactions of a very specific nature involving the light chain  <cit> . libraries based on the vh1- <dig> scaffold may therefore require a much larger diversity to achieve high affinity and specificity. we conclude that while there are some requirements in side chains of the lcdr positions , there is some permissiveness for affinity and specificity of the 5-helix antibody recognition provided the correct attributes are present.

humoral immunity requires a delicate balance of a broadly reactive naïve repertoire  and highly specific evolved antibodies. structural and biochemical work on hapten-binding antibodies has demonstrated that germline-encoded antibodies typically exhibit polyreactivity through dynamic cdrs  <cit> . mutations that arise during affinity maturation reduce the flexibility of the cdr segments such that they are locked into a conformation that is productive for antigen binding. this “conformation locking” mechanism may have played a role in dominance of wt hcdr <dig> because of the degeneracy of the codon set did not allow pro to be permitted in position  <dig> in d5-lib-ii, a residue that is important for the interaction with d <dig> 

however, it is less obvious how protein-binding antibodies evolve specificity and affinity. studies with an anti-hen egg white lysozyme  antibody and its germline-encoded progenitors suggests that affinity maturation in this case involves optimization of cdr loop conformations by mutation of a residue at the vh-vl interface  <cit> . similar to other protein-protein interactions, the affinity of protein-antibody interactions is significantly influenced by the complementarity of the two interacting surfaces and the exclusion of water at the intermolecular interface  <cit> . in the case of the anti-hel antibodies, a key mutation at the vh-vl interface resulted in hcdr <dig> and hcdr <dig> displacements that optimized the overall antigen-binding surface. this model is unlikely to be generalizable since the vast majority of matured protein-antibody interactions involve a high degree of mutation in the cdr segments. furthermore, in vitro evolution of protein-binding antibodies can be achieved by mutagenesis of the cdr segments alone  <cit> .

we previously examined the d5-5-helix interaction by scanning mutagenesis and found that the high affinity results from extended interactions involving the vh and vl. here we find that both affinity and specificity can be altered with mutations in the lcdrs and hcdr <dig>  the fact that positions in the functional paratope of the d5-5-helix complex  were permissive while retaining affinity and specificity suggests that there are multiple solutions to evolution of binding. however, the hexanomial restricted diversity library d5-lib-i did not yield high affinity clones; this result suggests that some functional constraints do exist, and that these constraints differ from other germline scaffolds.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have explored side chain requirements for binding and specificity in d <dig>  a model hiv- <dig> antibody derived from the vh1- <dig> germline segment. these results provide a template for future synthetic antibody libraries based on this germline scaffold, and provide novel insights into protein-antibody recognition.
