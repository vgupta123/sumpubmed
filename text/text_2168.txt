BACKGROUND
in the development of the mammalian retina, a diverse range of cell types is generated from a pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells. among these cell types, photoreceptors account for over 70% of all cells in the retina. in vertebrates, there are two classes of photoreceptors, rods and cones. rods are sensors of dim light, while cones function in bright light and are responsible for color vision. phototransduction, a series of signal amplifications detecting a single photon of light, is initiated by the capture of light with 11-cis-retinal, a chromophore bound by the opsin proteins: rhodopsin in rods and cone opsins in cones. the proteins that carry out phototransduction are located in an elaborate and highly specialized membranous structure, the outer segment. the outer segment appears to be relatively fragile, degenerating in response to many environmental and/or genetic perturbations. in the rodent retina, the production of specific cell types during development progresses in a general order  <cit> . rod photoreceptor generation peaks around the time of birth. cone photoreceptors, ganglion cells, horizontal cells and amacrine cells are generated earlier, while müller glia and bipolar cells are generated later. this production of different cell types at different times appears to derive from differences in the intrinsic properties of progenitor cells involved in the transcription or chromatin modification. recent studies identified several important transcription factors of photoreceptor development  <cit> . two otx family homeobox genes, otx <dig> and crx, play essential roles in early cell fate determination and terminal differentiation of photoreceptors  <cit> . in the absence of otx <dig> function, differentiating photoreceptor cells are converted to amacrine-like neurons  <cit> . crx, a downstream target of otx <dig>  controls the transcription of various photoreceptor cell-specific genes and is essential for the formation of outer segments, synaptic terminals, and phototransduction pathways  <cit> . crx transcripts begin to be expressed in developing photoreceptors at embryonic day  <dig>   in the mouse and a strong upregulation of crx transcription is apparent across the differentiating photoreceptors at postnatal day  <dig> . photoreceptor cells in the crx knockout  mice exhibit a dramatic reduction of many photoreceptor molecules including visual pigments and develop neither photoreceptor outer segments nor a synaptic terminus  <cit> . in addition, mutations of human crx have been demonstrated to be associated with three types of photoreceptor diseases: autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy  <dig>  autosomal dominant-type retinitis pigmentosa, and leber's congenital amaurosis   <cit> . while otx <dig> and crx control general photoreceptor development, three other transcription factors, trβ <dig>  nrl, and nr2e <dig> regulate the specification of photoreceptor cell types  <cit> .

sam domains  are ~ <dig> residues long and have been reported as common protein-protein interaction modules  <cit> . this domain is found in a large number of proteins, including polycomb group  proteins  <cit> , serine threonine kinases  <cit> , eph family receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> , the p <dig> tumor suppressor  <cit> , the rna-binding protein smaug  <cit> , diacylglycerol kinases  <cit> , yeast mating type signaling proteins  <cit>  and ets family transcription factors  <cit> . the pcg proteins are transcriptional repressors that maintain gene silencing during development  <cit> . in mammals, pcg proteins are also implicated in hox gene regulation. their biological activity lies in stable silencing of specific sets of genes through chromatin modifications. a member of polycomb repressive complex  <dig> , ph, contains a sam domain at the c-terminal, and prc <dig> complex is known to form helical, head-to-tail polymers through its sam domain  <cit> . these polymeric structures mediate the formation of a higher order chromatin structure and possibly stabilize the repressed state of hox genes.

in this study, we identified a novel gene, mr-s, which encodes a sam domain-containing protein. the sam domain of mr-s is most closely related to that of ph mouse ortholog, mph1/rae <dig>  mr-s is predominantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors when they undergo terminal differentiation, and adult pineal gland. the expression of mr-s is directly regulated by crx. moreover, mr-s is localized in the nucleus and can self-associate through its sam domain-containing region. we also found that mr-s protein fused to gal <dig> dna-binding domain functions as a transcriptional repressor. these findings suggest that mr-s functions as a member of a transcriptional repressor complex in retinal photoreceptor development.

RESULTS
cloning of mouse mr-s
in order to identify novel mouse genes preferentially expressed in the developing retina, we screened the national institute for biotechnology information  database, unigene, using digital differential display  and found est fragments which are frequently present in mouse retinal cdna libraries. we found that one clone in these cdnas encodes a protein containing a sam domain related to that of polyhomeotic protein. a pcr fragment corresponding to this mouse clone was used to screen a mouse p0-p <dig> retinal cdna library to obtain a full-length cdna clone. sequence analysis showed that this cdna was a novel gene encoding a sam domain-containing protein. we referred to this protein as mr-s . as shown in fig. 1a, a translation initiation codon is present in the same open reading frame as the sam domain. this initiation site shows similarity to the consensus sequence proposed by kozak  <cit>  including the presence of the highly conserved purine at position - <dig>  the stop codon of the predicted mr-s protein is also indicated in fig. 1a. the amino acid sequence of the sam domain of mr-s protein  exhibits homology with sam domains of ephb <dig>  epha <dig>  mph <dig>  tel and smaug . by phylogenetic analysis, the sam domain of mr-s is most closely related to that of mph1/rae <dig>  a mouse homolog of ph . mouse mr-s protein is conserved in rat, human, chick and zebrafish, which display 91%, 70%, 36% and 26% identity with mouse mr-s, respectively . the sam domains of rat, human, chick and zebrafish mr-s protein are highly conserved and display 96%, 90%, 76% and 72% identity with the sam domain of mouse mr-s protein. the chromosomal localizations of mouse and human mr-s genes were determined by searching the mouse and human genome databases , respectively. mouse mr-s is mapped to chromosome 4e <dig>  and human mr-s is mapped to chromosome 1p <dig> . lca is the most common cause of inherited childhood blindness. human mr-s maps in the vicinity region of the lca <dig>  recently identified as a new locus for lca  <cit> .

expression of mr-s in the developing retina and the pineal gland
to investigate mr-s expression, we first performed whole mount in situ hybridization in mouse embryos. no hybridization signal was detected at e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  with an mr-s probe . we then investigated the expression of the mr-s gene in the developing retina by section in situ hybridization . no significant signal was detected in the developing retina at e <dig> . a weak signal was initially detected in the outer aspect of the neuroblastic layer , a presumptive photoreceptor layer at e <dig> . at p <dig>  an mr-s transcript was clearly detected in the developing photoreceptor layer . at p <dig>  mr-s showed peak expression in the photoreceptor layer . this pattern correlates with the rapid increase in cells expressing rhodopsin and other phototransduction genes between p6-p <dig>  <cit> . at p <dig>  the intensity of the mr-s signal was significantly reduced but was localized to the outer nuclear layer  . faint expression of mr-s mrna was observed in mature photoreceptors in the adult retina .

to determine the tissue specificity of mr-s expression, the expression of the mr-s gene in various adult tissues was examined by northern hybridization . as a control, p <dig> retinal rna was used. four bands corresponding to  <dig> -kb,  <dig> -kb,  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb were detected in p <dig> retina. the  <dig> -kb band corresponds to the cdna characterized in this study. the larger bands, possibly alternative spliced transcripts, have not yet been characterized. the mr-s probe did not detect a band in the adult tissues examined, indicating that these tissues do not express mr-s at a level comparable to that of the developing retina.

previous reports revealed that many photoreceptor-specific genes are also expressed in the pineal gland  <cit> . we examined the expression of mr-s transcripts in the whole embryo, whole body, retina, pineal gland, brain, liver and other organs at various stages by rt-pcr . we amplified pcr fragments of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp with primer pairs for genes encoding mouse mr-s and g3pdh, respectively. in e <dig> whole embryo and p <dig> whole body , no mr-s signal was detected. as expected, we observed that mr-s is expressed in the p <dig> and adult pineal gland. in the p <dig> and adult brain, liver and several other organs, the rt-pcr amplified band of mr-s was not detected . our data showed that mr-s is predominantly expressed in developing photoreceptors and the pineal gland.

regulation of mr-s transcription by crx homeodomain protein
transcription factors otx <dig> and crx are known to be key regulators of retinal photoreceptor development  <cit> . although both otx <dig> and crx are expressed in developing photoreceptor cells in the embryonic retina, only crx is highly expressed in the postnatal photoreceptors, suggesting that mr-s may be regulated by crx. to test whether crx regulates mr-s transcription, we performed in situ hybridization of mr-s mrna on wild-type and crx ko p <dig> retinas . in the crx ko retina, the mr-s transcript was dramatically reduced . this indicates that crx is essential for transactivation of mr-s. moreover, to test whether the transcription of mr-s is also regulated by crx in the pineal gland, rt-pcr analysis was used to compare transcriptional levels of mr-s in p <dig> wild-type and crx ko pineal gland . the results revealed that mr-s transcription was significantly downregulated in the crx ko pineal gland. taken together, these data indicate that mr-s transcription is regulated by crx in the developing photoreceptors and pineal gland.

to further examine whether crx regulates mr-s transcription directly or not, we next performed a luciferase assay using the  <dig> -kb proximal promoter region of mr-s fused to a luciferase gene as a luciferase reporter  and the crx, otx <dig>  nrl expression vectors, respectively. this  <dig> -kb region of the mr-s upstream sequence contains three crx binding consensus sequences. as shown in fig. 3e, the luciferase activity was significantly upregulated when the crx or otx <dig> expression vector was co-introduced with pro <dig> k into hek293t cells, while the luciferase activity was not altered when the nrl expression vector was co-introduced. a previous report suggested that the transcriptional activity of crx is augmented with nrl when the rhodopsin promoter was used as a reporter gene  <cit> . on the other hand, our present data showed that the luciferase gene expression was not upregulated when both crx and nrl expression vectors were co-introduced with pro <dig> k compared to the activity when the crx only expression vector was introduced. this may be due to cell type differences because a cell type of retinal/pineal origin was not used in our luciferase assay. in addition, our present data showed that otx <dig>  which is reported to have the same binding consensus as crx, also transactivated mr-s expression. as shown in fig. 2a–f, the expression pattern of mr-s correlates with that of crx. in contrast, the transcripts of otx <dig> are mainly detected in the photoreceptor layer at embryonic stages. therefore, we concluded that mr-s transcription is directly regulated mainly by crx.

we also constructed reporter vectors in which mutations were introduced at the three crx binding sites . then the crx expression vector was co-introduced with mut <dig>  mut <dig>  mut <dig> and mut all, respectively . the transactivaton activity by crx was clearly reduced when mut <dig> or mut <dig> was co-introduced. on the other hand, when mut <dig> was co-transfected, the transactivation activity by crx was not altered. these results suggest that the crx binding sites 72-bp and 198-bp upstream from the transcription initiation site are crucial for the direct regulation of mr-s transcription by crx.

self-association of mr-s protein
sam domains are known to function as protein-protein interaction modules  <cit> . although sam domains can bind to various non-sam domain-containing proteins, many homo-sam and hetero-sam domain interactions have been reported. to investigate whether the sam domain of the mr-s protein can also function as a protein-protein interaction module, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length mr-s protein as the bait. using this bait, we screened the transcriptional activator fusion protein library in which mouse p0-p <dig> retinal cdnas were fused to the gal <dig> activation domain. the most frequent positive clones  were cdna fragments containing the sam domain of mr-s . this result strongly suggests that mr-s protein self-associates through sam domain-containing regions. we then directly tested this self-association of mr-s protein in yeast. we fused full-length or truncated portions of the mr-s protein to the dna-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor gal <dig> to make bait constructs. we fused full-length or truncated portions of the mr-s protein to the gal <dig> transcriptional activation domain to make prey constructs . these constructs were transformed into yeast that contain a transgene with gal <dig> binding sites upstream of the lacz gene. we found that the full-length mr-s bait construct induced lacz expression with the full-length mr-s prey construct . the n-terminus  <dig> amino acid  stretch of mr-s, which does not contain a sam domain, does weakly activate transcription of lacz . the n-terminus  <dig> aa stretch of mr-s was able to induce transcription of lacz weakly with the same n-terminus  <dig> aa stretch of mr-s . although the n-terminus  <dig> aa mr-s protein weakly activates lacz transcription with the same n-terminus portion, a much stronger activation of lacz expression was observed with a c-terminus portion encoding the 391– <dig> aa stretch of mr-s . our gal <dig> assay indicated that the signal when the full-length mr-s was present in both the bait and prey contexts was weaker than when isolated sam domains were used. this may simply reflect the tendency for the small fusion proteins to enter the yeast nucleus and occupy gal <dig> binding sites. alternatively, the sam domain may be less accessible for interaction in the full-length protein context as previously reported  <cit> .

to confirm self-association of the mr-s protein in mammalian cells, we next performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in hek293t cells by co-transfection of ha-tagged full-length/truncated mr-s and flag-tagged full-length/truncated mr-s . as a negative control, we constructed flag-tagged sonic hedgehog  . in accordance with the result of the yeast two-hybrid gal <dig> assay, ha-tagged full-length mr-s  was co-immunoprecipitated with flag-tagged full-length mr-s  and the flag-tagged c-terminus portion containing the sam domain , respectively . we also found a weak co-immunoprecipitation band in co-transfection of full-ha and flag-tagged n-terminus portion of mr-s . when Δsam-ha and flag-tagged deletion mutants were co-transfected, Δsam-ha was co-immunoprecipitated with flag-mrs and flag-Δsam , while Δsam-ha was not co-immunoprecipitated with flag-sam .

to investigate whether the mr-s protein self-associates mainly through the sam domain, two site-directed mutations were generated in the sam domain of mr-s . these mutations alter residues that are conserved in the sam domain of ph and previous report indicates that these mutations of ph-sam cause significant reduction in binding activity to the other sam domain-containing protein, sex comb on midleg  . based on this result, we introduced two types of site-directed mutations, which correspond to the mutations introduced in ph protein, into flag-tagged full-length mr-s . we found that flag-w404a binding activity was significantly reduced and flag-g453a binding activity was also slightly reduced compared to flag-mrs . these results, together with yeast two-hybrid gal <dig> assay, indicate that the mr-s protein self-associates strongly through its sam domain and weakly through the n-terminus portion lacking sam domain.

the subcellular localization of mr-s protein in mammalian cells
the putative nuclear localization signal at the n-terminus of the mr-s protein  suggests that the mr-s protein localizes in the nucleus. to determine the subcellular localization of mr-s in mammalian cells, we introduced an ha-tagged full-length mr-s plasmid into hek293t cells. confocal microscopy showed that the mr-s protein localized mainly in the nucleus of hek293t cells . to confirm the precise localization of the mr-s protein, full-length mr-s was co-immunostained with dapi . these data showed that the mr-s protein localizes preferentially to the nucleus in mammalian cells, supporting the idea that the mr-s protein is involved in transcriptional regulation as are ph and/or tel.

the gal4-mr-s fusion protein functions as transcriptional repressor
a member of pcg proteins, ph, does not contain an obvious sequence-specific dna binding motif . ph functions as a transcriptional repressor through its polymerization and protein-protein interaction with other sequence-specific transcriptional repressors, which can form a higher order chromatin structure. the mr-s protein also does not have an obvious dna-binding domain. to characterize the biochemical activity of mr-s, we next performed a luciferase assay. we generated effector plasmids, which express various deletion constructs of mr-s fused to the gal <dig> dna-binding domain . we first confirmed that full-length mr-s fused to gal <dig> dna binding domain  had no effect on the pgl <dig> promoter plasmid lacking gal <dig> binding sites . when the 5xgal4-pgl <dig> reporter plasmid was co-transfected, dbd-mrs repressed luciferase activity by about 90% in a dose-dependent manner . as a control, gal <dig> dna-binding domain  had no significant effect on the 5xgal4-pgl <dig> reporter plasmid. in addition, we confirmed that full-length mr-s without gal <dig> dbd had no effect on the same reporter plasmid . we next analyzed deletion constructs in which the n-terminus  <dig> aa stretch of mr-s  or the c-terminus portion  were fused to the gal <dig> dbd . while dbd-n had no repressive effect on this reporter activity, dbd-c repressed luciferase gene expression by about 65%. this result suggested to us the possibility that dbd-mrs exerts transcriptional repressive activity via self-association through its sam domain. to investigate whether the homophilic association of mr-s is required for transcriptional repression, two site-directed mutants, dbd-w404a and dbd-g453a, either of which may reduce self-binding ability, were analyzed . compared to dbd-mrs, dbd-w404a and dbd-g453a had repression activity of 72% and 87%, respectively. while the ability of mr-s self-association partially correlates with transcriptional repressive activity, these mutants do not compromise the ability to repress transcription critically. to determine the regions of mr-s involved in transcriptional repression more precisely, the c-terminus portion was divided into two regions and each was fused to the gal <dig> dbd . as a consequence, dbd-sam  did not have a repressive effect on the 5xgal4-pgl <dig> reporter plasmid. on the other hand, luciferase activity was repressed by 55% when dbd-tail  was co-transfected with this reporter plasmid . to assess the transcriptional repressive activity of mr-s in cells of retinal origin, we performed similar experiments using human y <dig> retinoblastoma cells. the results indicated that dbd-mrs also reduced luciferase activity significantly in y <dig> retinoblastoma cells . however, luciferase activity was repressed by about 30% in y <dig> cells, while it was repressed by 90% in hek293t cells. this might be due to the difference in transfection efficiency between these cell lines. another possibility is that intracellular environment in y <dig> cells, a retinoblastoma cell line, is insufficient for recapitulating developing photoreceptors. in this study, we did not address the question whether or not our in vitro data reflect native mr-s transcriptional repression in vivo. however, these in vitro experiments using hek293t and y <dig> cells strongly support our hypothesis that mr-s functions as a transcriptional repressor in developing photoreceptors. our results suggested that the c-terminal region of mr-s  is required for transcriptional repression of mr-s and the sam domain appears to be dispensable for this repressive activity. this c-terminal region of mouse mr-s is highly conserved among species . the sequence identity of the region was 93%, 73%, 41% and 40% for rat, human, chick and zebrafish, respectively . this strongly suggests that the c-terminal region of mouse mr-s functions as a transcriptional repressive domain in photoreceptor development. however, this region does not contain characteristic amino acid motifs and the mechanism through which the region achieves and/or maintains gene repression remains to be clarified in the future.

taken together, our findings suggest that dbd-mrs functions as a transcriptional repressor and that the repression activity of mr-s is not due to a homophilic interaction through its sam domain but to the c-terminal region .

discussion
in the present study, we identified a novel gene, mr-s, which is predominantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors and the pineal gland. the peak of mr-s expression in the developing retina is around p <dig>  this expression pattern correlates with the rapid increase of crx, rhodopsin and other photoreceptor genes around p6-p <dig>  around p <dig>  the outer plexiform layer becomes visible and the outer layer of retina separates into two layers, onl and inl. at the same time, photoreceptors begin to undergo terminal differentiation, forming the outer segment. we therefore hypothesized that mr-s is a key molecule in the late development of photoreceptors.

we previously reported that otx <dig> and crx have a critical role in photoreceptor development and that otx <dig> directly regulates crx transcription  <cit> . in situ hybridization and rt-pcr showed significant reduction of mr-s signal in the crx ko retina and pineal gland. furthermore, the luciferase assay demonstrated that otx <dig> and crx may directly upregulate the transcription of mr-s in mammalian cells. in retinal photoreceptor cells, the otx <dig> transcripts are not highly expressed at p6-p <dig>  while the crx transcripts are strongly detected around p <dig>  therefore, our results strongly suggest that mr-s transcription is directly regulated by crx. in the present study, nrl, a photoreceptor-specific transcription factor that is highly expressed in photoreceptors at the postnatal stage, did not affect the transcription of mr-s. this finding is actually consistent with the analysis of the nrl ko mouse which was recently reported  <cit> . the expression profiles of wild-type and nrl ko retinas at p <dig>  p <dig> and  <dig> months were analyzed and mr-s was not included in  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the nrl ko retina.

previous reports suggested that the sam domain is a protein-protein interaction module. the sam domain of the mr-s protein is closely related to that of ph and tel, whose sam domains can form a helical, head-to-tail polymeric structure and mediate the formation of a higher order chromatin structure. to characterize the biochemical function of mr-s, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length mr-s as the bait. as a result, the most frequent positive clones  in the screening were the cdna fragments containing the sam domain of mr-s. this strongly suggests that mr-s self-associates through its sam domain. an immunoprecipitation assay, using two site-directed mutants of the sam domain of mr-s, demonstrated that the mr-s protein can self-associate through its sam domain in mammalian cells. while we did not address the question whether the sam domain of mr-s forms a polymeric structure in the present study, the phylogenetic analysis of sam domain of mr-s and other sam domain-containing molecules suggests that mr-s can form head-to-tail polymer and mediate gene silencing by spreading repressive complexes along the chromatin similar to ph and/or tel. although our results in the immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the n-terminal constructs lacking a sam domain still interact with each other, these results do not fit into the head-to-tail polymer model. we cannot exclude the possibility that the resulting protein-protein interaction of mr-s is an artifact of the overexpression conditions. the issue of whether or not mr-s forms a polymer awaits future analysis.

a previous report indicated that tel contains a sequence-specific dna binding domain, namely the ets domain, and binds to specific sites via its ets domain  <cit> . tel could serve to nucleate a polymer, which would spread by oligomerization of the sam domain. in contrast to tel, ph does not contain an obvious sequence-specific dna binding motif . therefore, its initial binding to the template may require protein-protein interactions with other sequence-specific transcriptional repressors. the segmentation gene-encoding transcriptional repressors such as hunchback have a role in recruiting sam domain-containing pcg proteins, which can spread along the template via polymerization  <cit> . since mr-s does not contain obvious dna binding motifs, we suppose that there is a sequence-specific transcription factor which interacts with mr-s. however, we did not find any transcription factors in the present yeast two-hybrid screening.

we also found that full-length mr-s fused to the gal <dig> dna binding domain  functions as a transcriptional repressor. this may support the idea that mr-s is involved in repressive complexes similar to other sam domain-containing proteins. our results, however, showed that the self-association of mr-s through its sam domain is not essential for the transcriptional repressive activity. polymerization of the sam domain has been previously reported to be essential for the repressive functions of ph and tel  <cit> . on the other hand, human lethal malignant brain tumor mbt) protein, which also contains a sam domain at the c-terminus, was reported as a transcriptional repressor and the repressor activity of h-lmbt required mainly the presence of the mbt repeats but not the sam domain  <cit> . to determine the transcriptional repressor region of the mr-s protein, we performed a luciferase assay using site-directed mutants . the result showed that the reduced binding ability of self-association partially compromises the transcriptional repressive activity of mr-s . however, the repressive effect was more significant when dbd-tail, which does not contain sam domain, was co-introduced with the 5xgal4-pgl <dig> reporter plasmid. therefore, we conclude that a region from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> is mainly responsible for the repressor activity in the case of mr-s. evolutionary conservation of the c-terminal  <dig> aa region of mr-s from zebrafish through human may underlie the functional importance of this region.

two distinct multiprotein pcg complexes, prc <dig> and prc <dig>  have been identified. prc <dig> is involved in the initiation of silencing and contains histone deacetylases  and histone methyltransferases, which can methylate histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> and  <dig>  marks of silenced chromatin. prc <dig>  including ph, recognizes the histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> mark set by prc <dig> and maintains a stable state of gene repression in which prc <dig> blocks chromatin remodeling by the trithorax group-related swi-snf complex  <cit> . therefore, the mechanism of repression by prc <dig> is thought to be hdac-dependent while the mechanism of repression by prc <dig> appears to be hdac-independent. our luciferase assay also showed that transcriptional repression of dbd-mrs was not affected by the addition of various concentrations of trichostatin a, a potent hdac inhibitor . therefore, we speculate that the mechanism of repression of mr-s may be hdac-independent and more similar to that of prc <dig> complex.

in the present study, the biochemical experiments demonstrate that the mr-s protein functions as a transcriptional repressor and possibly down-regulates the spatial and temporal expression of the target genes during retinal photoreceptor development. our data also revealed that the repressive activity of mr-s is mainly due to the c-terminal region . however, downstream targets of mr-s still remain unclear. in situ hybridization showed that the peak of mr-s expression is around p <dig>  when retinal photoreceptors undergo terminal differentiation. we hypothesize that the target genes of mr-s might be non-photoreceptor genes. in this case, mr-s may suppress the expression of non-photoreceptor genes in rod and cone photoreceptors. there may be another possibility that mr-s is involved in cell fate determination of rod photoreceptors versus cone photoreceptors. while cone photoreceptors are born during the early embryonic stages of mouse retinogenesis, rod photoreceptors are born primarily in the late embryonic and early postnatal period  <cit> . the expression pattern of mr-s may suggest that mr-s is expressed in rod photoreceptors but not in cone photoreceptors as well as nr2e <dig>  which is known as a transcriptional repressor and is thought to down-regulate cone photoreceptor-specific genes. to clarify the biological function of mr-s, analysis of mice with targeted disruptions of mr-s will be very important.

CONCLUSIONS
here we identified mouse mr-s, which is predominantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors and the pineal gland. mr-s is evolutionarily conserved from zebrafish through to human, suggesting a significant role of mr-s in photoreceptor development. our present data suggest that mr-s protein localizes in the nucleus and can self-associated mainly through the sam domain. moreover, mr-s protein fused to gal <dig> dbd functions as a transcriptional repressor. the repressive activity of mr-s is due to its c-terminal region . taken together, mr-s is a novel repressor molecule possibly involved in the development of retinal photoreceptors and pineal gland.
