BACKGROUND
the progress of high-throughput sequencing  technologies enables the variant detection of each individual in genome-wide scale in practical time and with reasonable cost. from hts data, various types of single nucleotide variant  calling methods have been proposed , and snvs for more than a thousand of individuals were accurately detected  <cit> . however, unlike snvs, we still have difficulty in accurately detecting structural variations such as genome insertions, genome deletions, short tandem repeat  number polymorphisms, and copy number variations, especially from low coverage hts data  <cit> .

some repeat number polymorphisms are associated with various disease phenotypes such as cag repeats in the huntingtin gene with huntington’s disease  <cit> . from hts data, several approaches such as lobstr and repeatseq  <cit>  have been proposed for the estimation of repeat numbers in str regions by directly counting repeat patterns in sequence reads spanning the regions. in these approaches, the accuracy on both the detection of str variants and estimated repeat numbers is high. another strategy is to use paired-end reads aligned to the flanking regions of the target str region in the reference genome  <cit> . insert size inferred from the aligned paired-end reads is longer than its actual size if the repeat number is smaller than that in the reference genome. on the other hand, the inferred insert size is shorter if the repeat number is larger. by detecting the difference between the inferred and actual insert size, repeat numbers are estimated. since insert size is generally longer than sequence reads, this strategy can be used for estimating repeat numbers for relatively long str regions that cannot be handled by the strategy counting repeat patterns in sequence reads. however, repeat numbers estimated from insert size data are less accurate than those from the strategy counting repeat patterns directly in the sequence reads, especially for low coverage hts data.

we proposed a new statistical model named coalescentstr that estimates repeat numbers for multiple individuals simultaneously from paired-end read distances by connecting the read generative model for each individual with their genealogy. in the model, the genealogy is represented with coalescent trees, which describe the ancestral history of multiple individuals on a local genome region backwards in time . by considering the change in repeat numbers in coalescent trees in a natural manner, more accurate estimation of repeat numbers is expected. for the estimation of repeat numbers in the model, coalescent trees handled as hidden variables are sampled with markov chain monte carlo  according to phased genotypes around a target str region. we proposed a new belief propagation method that calculates the loopy belief propagation  <cit>  and the mixed-product belief propagation  <cit>  by taking the summation on the sampled coalescent trees. by using the proposed belief propagation, approximated maximum configuration of repeat numbers in the model are searched for the estimation of repeat numbers.

in a simulation study, we used synthetically generated hts data for str regions mostly longer than read length, and showed the effectiveness of our model from the comparison with other existing methods, especially in handling more individuals. the effectiveness of our approach is also verified from the analysis of real whole exome data of hapmap jpt individuals and whole genome sequencing  data of hapmap ceu and gbr individuals analyzed in the  <dig> genomes project .

method
we describe a model considering insert size of paired-end reads for one individual and its extension to consider multiple individuals based on their unobserved genealogy. procedures for the repeat number estimation are then explained.

repeat number estimation from paired-end read distance
we consider a statistical model that estimates repeat number in an str region from paired-end read distance for one individual. we hereafter call the model a basic model. let s be the start position of the forward read of the dth aligned read pair. we also let e be the end position of the reverse read of the dth aligned read pair. the insert size of the dth read pair or the length of the dna fragment from which the read pair was generated is given by e−s, and we denote the insert size e−s as l.

if an x bp insertion variant exists between s and e in the genome of an individual, l is x bp shorter than the actual insert size of the dth read pair. on the other hand, if an x bp deletion variant exists between s and e, l is x bp longer than its actual insert size. by detecting the difference between l and the actual insert size, the basic model estimates repeat numbers. let u, nr, n <dig>  and n <dig> be the length of a repeat pattern, the repeat number in reference genome, the repeat number on haplotype  <dig>  and the repeat number on haplotype  <dig>  respectively. if the dna fragment for the dth read pair spans the str region in haplotype  <dig>  its actual insert size is given by l+u·, and hence the probability of l is given by f+u·), where f is the insert size distribution of the sequence data. if the start or end position of the dna fragment is in the inside of the str region, the dna fragment cannot be used for estimating repeat numbers. thus, l must be longer than em−s, where em is the end position of the str region in the reference genome. we also exclude the dna fragment longer than k, i.e., f takes  <dig> for l>k, where k is a sufficiently large number and is set to  <dig>  bp in our study. the generative probability of l is represented by normalizing f as follows: 
 p∣n)=f+u·)n,n)ifl>em−s&l≤k−u·0otherwise,  where n is the normalization factor given by 
 n=∑l=em−s+1k−u·f). 

since each read pair is generated from one of two dna sequences in equal probability, the likelihood of l is represented by 
  <dig> ∏d=1dp∣n <dig> n2)=∏d=1d12p∣n1)+p∣n2), 

where d is the number of read pairs. we consider the maximum and minimum repeat numbers nmax and nmin and search the pair of ni <dig> and ni <dig> in {nmin,…,nmax}×{nmin,…,nmax} maximizing eq. , which requires o2) time. the computational time in the basic model is mainly taken by the calculation of the normalization factor n, which requires ok) time in a naïve way. thus, we propose an algorithm that calculates n more efficiently by considering the following two recurrence formulae of n: 
 n=n+f)n=n−∑l=em−s+1em−s+uf). 

by using the above recurrence formulae, n is calculated for s∈{sm−k,sm−1} and n∈{nmin,…,nmax}, where sm is the start position of the str region. since the repeat pattern size u is usually less than or equal to four and can be considered as a constant, the calculation of n requires ok) time, which is smaller than that required in the naïve way.

repeat number estimation considering genealogy of multiple individuals
dna sequences are inherited from parents to offspring, and single base substitutions occur in the inheritance with mutation rate of around  <dig> ×10− <dig>  <cit> . repeat numbers in str regions also change or mutate in the inheritance from a parent to its offspring with rate ranging usually from  <dig> ×10− <dig> to  <dig> ×10− <dig>  <cit> . from the phased genotypes around an str region of interest for multiple individuals, we consider their genealogy around the region by using coalescent tree . coalescent tree is a binary tree in which leaves represent the current haplotypes and internal nodes represent past coalescent events of the haplotypes. for each coalescent event, two linages are involved, and cases involving more than two lineages are not considered in our model. the length of each edge in the tree represents time between coalescent events.

we propose a new statistical model named coalescentstr that uses coalescent trees estimated from phased genotypes around an str region to connect the basic models of multiple individuals for more accurate estimation of their repeat numbers. repeat numbers in the str region obey the estimated coalescent tree. thus, given nearby phased genotypes v, we consider the prior distribution of repeat numbers via coalescent trees estimated from v and model insert size inferred from paired-end reads in the following formula. let li be an insert size of the dth read pair for the ith individual. we also denote ni <dig> and ni <dig> as repeat numbers of haplotype  <dig> and haplotype  <dig> for the ith individual, respectively. we represent the likelihood of insert size li as 
  <dig> p=∏i=1i∏d=1dip∣ni <dig> ni2)∑gpp, 

where i is the number of individuals, l is a set of li, n is a set of ni <dig> and ni <dig>  di is the number of read pairs for individual i, and g is a coalescent tree. the first term in the right hand of eq.  is given by the likelihood function of the basic model. in the second term, repeat numbers are connected by coalescent tree g as 
  <dig> p=∑nc1=nminnmax⋯∑nci−1=nminnmax∏v∈cg∏u∈ov|gpnu∣nv,tv,u|g;μs, 

where cg is a set of internal nodes c <dig> …,ci− <dig> in g, ov|g is a set of offspring nodes of v in g, tv,u|g is coalescent time from node v to u in g, and nv is a repeat number in node v. note that the size of ov|g is two. p represents the change of repeat numbers from parent node v to its offspring node u in time tv,u|g with mutation rate μs. for the change of repeat numbers, we consider the stepwise model  <cit> , where repeat numbers change at most one in one generation with mutation rate μs. with the brownian motion approximation to the stepwise model  <cit> , p is given by 
 p=min{ <dig> nnu;nv,ne·μs·tv,u|g},  where n represents the normal distribution and ne is the effective population size. p represents the probability of coalescent tree g given nearby phased genotypes v. since it is infeasible to calculate the summation in all possible coalescent trees g in eq. , we sample a set of coalescent trees g from the phased genotypes v with mcmc  <cit> , and calculate the summation only on g∈g: 
  <dig> p=∏i=1i∏d=1dipli∣ni <dig> ni2∑g∈gp. 

for sampling with mcmc, burn-in period, period between samples, and the number of samples are respectively set to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> in our study.

estimation of repeat numbers in coalescentstr
in coalescentstr, repeat numbers are estimated by finding n maximizing eq. : 
 n^=argmaxn∏i=1i∏d=1dipli∣ni <dig> ni2∑g∈gp. 

the calculation of the exact value of n^ is known as the marginal map problem and np-hard even when the model structure including other hidden variables is a tree  <cit> . if the number of trees in g is one, i.e., the summation in g is not considered, the mixed-product belief propagation   <cit>  can be applied to obtain an approximated solution of n^. however, if the summation in g is considered, the mixed-product belief propagation cannot be applied directly, and a new algorithm is required for the solution. here, we propose a new belief propagation algorithm named multiple-tree belief propagation , which considers belief propagation in multiple trees. given messages to variables in n∖{ni1}, we consider message passing from variables in n∖{ni1} to ni <dig>  in multiple-tree bp, message to ni <dig> on each tree is calculated independently. since message passing can be calculated exactly on tree structures by the belief propagation, a message to ni <dig> can be obtained by taking the summation of messages to ni <dig> from trees. multiple-tree bp is extended to the loopy belief propagation   <cit>  and mixed-product bp. we first consider multiple-tree bp for loopy bp, and then describe its extension to mixed-product bp later. a message from internal node v in coalescent tree g to its parent pv∣g is given by 
 mv→pv∣g=∑nv=nminnmaxpnu∣nv,tv,u|g;μs·mo1→v·mo2→v, 

where o <dig> and o <dig> are offspring of v. on the other hand, a message from a leaf node i <dig> to its parent pi1∣g in coalescent tree g is given by 
  <dig> mi1→pi1∣g=∑ni1=nminnmaxp·mi2→i <dig>  

where mi2→i <dig> is a message from ni <dig> to ni <dig>  a message from internal node v to one of its offspring o <dig> is given by 
 mv→o1=∑nv=nminnmaxp·mpv∣g→v·mo2→v, 

where o <dig> is a sibling of o <dig>  a message from ni <dig> to ni <dig> is calculated by 
  <dig> mi1→i2=∑ni1=nminnmax∏d=1dip∣ni <dig> ni2)·∑g∈gmpi1∣g→i <dig>  
 mi1→i2=maxni1∏d=1dip∣ni <dig> ni2)∑g∈gmpi1∣g→i <dig>   and eq.  is replaced with 
 m~i1→pi1∣gnpi1∣g=∑ni1∈ni1pni <dig> npi1∣g;μs,tpi1∣g,i1·mi2→i <dig>  fig.  <dig> coalescent trees on three individuals and messages in the belief propagation. the flow of messages from v to pv∣g <dig>  from v to its offspring o
 <dig>  from leaf  <dig> to leaf  <dig>  from leaf  <dig> to leaf  <dig>  from p11∣g <dig> to leaf  <dig>  and from trees to leaf  <dig> are illustrated



where ni <dig> is a set of ni <dig> maximizing mi2→i1·∑g∈gmpi1∣g→i <dig>  after some iterations of mixed-product bp, n^i1∈n^ is obtained by argmaxni1mi2→i1·∑g∈gmpi1∣g→i <dig>  we first calculate loopy bp in ten cycles and then calculate mixed-product bp in ten cycles using messages from loopy bp as initial values. empirically, the above procedure provides better n^ than only considering mixed-product bp.

selection of str mutation rate
messages from loopy bp is used to calculate the following value: 
  <dig> ∑i=1i∑ni1=nminnmaxm¯i2→i1·m¯g→i1+∑ni2=nminnmaxm¯i1→i2·m¯g→i <dig>  

where m¯i2→i <dig> is mi2→i <dig> normalized to have a sum of one and m¯g→i <dig> is a message to ni <dig> from coalescent trees ∑g∈gmpi1∣g normalized to have a sum of one. we consider that messages from paired-end reads to ni <dig> or ni <dig> and from coalescent trees to ni <dig> or ni <dig> are similar to each other if the str mutation rate is proper. the value in eq.  is designed to take higher value if those messages are more similar to each other. we consider several str mutation rates and select the rate with the highest value given by eq. .

RESULTS
simulation analysis
given a target str region, we first synthetically generated repeat numbers of the str region and nearby phased genotypes for 2i haplotypes as follows: 
generate a coalescent tree for 2i haplotypes with an algorithm in  <cit>  under the assumption of a constant effective population size.

obtain phased genotypes at  <dig>  bp upstream and downstream positions of the str region based on the generated coalescent tree and a specified single base substitution rates.

obtain repeat numbers based on the generated coalescent tree by considering the stepwise model with a specified str mutation rate.



the effective population size was set to  <dig>   <cit> , and single base substitution rates on transition and transversion were set to  <dig> ×10− <dig> and  <dig> ×10− <dig>  respectively as in  <cit> . for the str region, we considered tttc repeat region at chr7:127898719- <dig> in the human reference genome  from tandem repeat regions detected by tandem repeats finder  <cit> . the reference repeat number, the repeat number in the reference genome for the region, is  <dig>  we obtained synthetically generated diploid genome sequences for each individual by editing grch <dig> chromosome  <dig> sequence according to repeat numbers in the region and phased genotypes around the region generated by the above procedures. the following settings were considered for the number of individuals and mutation rate: 
five types of the numbers of individuals:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

two types of str mutation rates:  <dig> ×10− <dig> and  <dig> ×10− <dig>  the former rate is an estimated str mutation rate for tetranucleotide repeats, and the latter for dinucleotide repeats in human  <cit> .



from each edited diploid genome pair, paired-end read reads with length of  <dig> bp and  <dig>  % base substitution errors were generated in fastq format. insert size of each read pair is normally distributed with mean  <dig> bp and standard deviation  <dig> bp. for the read coverage for each individual,  <dig> × and  <dig> × were considered. the generated pair-end read data was aligned to the reference genome with bwa-mem  <cit> . we set the repeat number on the root of the generated coalescent trees to  <dig> to obtain repeat numbers with the size close to the read length. for coalescentstr and the basic model, read pairs satisfying the following conditions were extracted for obtaining the insert size data for each individual: 
directions of paired-end reads are concordant.

the start position of the forward read in each aligned read pair is located before the start position of the str region.

the end position of the reverse read in each aligned read pair is located after the end position of the str region.



let ni <dig> and ni <dig> be true repeat numbers for the ith individual. we also let n^i <dig> and n^i <dig> be estimated repeat numbers for the ith individual. for the evaluation, we considered a root mean squared error  between true and estimated repeat numbers given by 
 12i∑i=1imin{2+ <dig> +2}. 

we evaluated the performance of coalescentstr, the basic model, lobstr  <cit> , repeatseq  <cit> , and strviper  <cit> . in coalescentstr, an str mutation rate was selected from rates in { <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> . <dig> , <dig> ,100} multiplied by the true str mutation rate based on the value given in eq. . nmax and nmin were set to  <dig> and zero, respectively. for each condition, we prepared ten coalescent trees and generated sequence datasets from them. in order to examine the effect of considering the genealogy, we randomly shuffled haplotypes on phased genotypes and used them for coalescentstr. tables  <dig> and  <dig> show rmse values for results from coalescentstr, coalescentstr with the shuffled haplotypes , the basic model, lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper averaged on ten trials for the five types of individual counts, str mutation rates of  <dig> ×10− <dig> and  <dig> ×10− <dig>  and read coverages of  <dig> × and  <dig> ×, respectively.

if no str variant was detected, the reference repeat number,  <dig>  was assigned as the estimated repeat number. strviper reports only one repeat number for each individuals although each individual has two repeat numbers. thus, two repeat numbers in each individual were set to the same value in results of strviper. coalescentstr gives the best result in most of the conditions and coalescentstr  gives the best result in some conditions with sample sizes of  <dig> and  <dig>  if the sample size considered for estimation is small, the improvement of the performance by considering multiple individuals in coalescentstr is limited. thus, coalescentstr  can provide better results than coalescentstr for some conditions with small sample sizes.

since some repeat numbers are longer than or equal to the read length, the results from paired-end read distance based methods  are better than those from methods counting repeat numbers in sequences reads . the rmse value is smaller for considering more individuals on coalescentstr. in addition, the performance of coalescentstr with the shuffled haplotypes is worse than that of coalescentstr with correct haplotypes. these observations support the effectiveness of considering the genealogy. the rmse value for each method on the dataset with read coverage of  <dig> × is smaller than that on the dataset with read coverage of  <dig> × in most of the cases.

in the plot for coalescentstr, points are around the diagonal line. points in the plot for coalescentstr  are also located around the diagonal line, but scattered in larger area than those in the plot for coalescentstr. in addition, points in the plot for the basic model are scattered in larger area around the diagonal line than those in plots for coalescentstr and coalescentstr . there exists a horizontal line with the value twice as much as the reference repeat number in plots for lobstr and repeatseq the line is due to points for cases where these methods failed to str variants and provided the reference repeat number as estimated repeat numbers. for cases with str variants which can be detected by repeatseq, the corresponding points are located around the diagonal line tightly. on the other hand, points associated with str variants which can be detected by lobstr are scattered around the diagonal line. in the plot for strviper, the sum of estimated diploid repeat numbers is correlated with the sum of true diploid repeat numbers, but differences between estimated repeat numbers and the reference repeat number are underestimated.

real data analysis
we evaluated the performance of coalescentstr, basic model, lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper using exome sequencing data of jpt individuals and wgs data of ceu and gbr individuals.

performance evaluation with exome sequencing data
we evaluated the performance of coalescentstr, basic model, lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper on an str region comprised of tca repeats located in the exon region of cenpp at chr9:95237025- <dig> by using 1kgp exome datasets for  <dig> hapmap jpt individuals  <cit> . the reference repeat number is  <dig>  and repeat numbers in the region range mainly from  <dig> to  <dig>  read length of datasets for some individuals is  <dig> bp and that for remaining individuals is  <dig> bp. since the total length of the str region is included in the read length, repeat numbers can be inferred directly from the sequence reads spanning the region. in order to evaluate performance on repeats with the size close to the read length, we truncated the tail of each read to obtain paired-end sequence datasets with length of  <dig> bp in fastq format. for the true repeat numbers of the datasets, repeat numbers estimated from the original datasets with lobstr were used. sequence reads in the obtained datasets were aligned to the reference genome with bwa-mem. insert size distribution was obtained from the datasets for each individual. phased genotypes around the str region for coalescentstr were obtained from the 1kgp phase <dig> imputation panels released in october,  <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . phased genotypes at  <dig>  bp upstream and downstream positions of the str region were used for sampling coalescent trees. an str mutation rate was selected from { <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> } based on the value given by eq. . nmax and nmin were set to  <dig> and zero, respectively. rmse values in the results from coalescentstr, coalescentstr , the basic model, lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper on the datasets with read length of  <dig> bp are summarized in table  <dig>  since read length of  <dig> bp is not sufficient for the detecting the repeat patterns directly from sequence reads including the str region, no str variant was detected in lobstr and repeatseq for all the individuals. although strviper assumes the normality on insert size distribution, the actual insert size in the datasets is not normally distributed as shown in fig.  <dig>  and hence strviper may fail to detect the str variants. for cases of detecting no str variant, the reference repeat number was assigned for the estimated repeat numbers. coalescentstr gives the best rmse, and the basic model gives the worst rmse. since the quality of the data is different between datasets, the basic model failed to estimate repeat numbers for low quality datasets. in addition, since the true repeat numbers do not vary a lot, the results with the reference repeat number for all the individuals give not so bad rmse, and hence the result of the basic model is the worst among the methods.

in the plot for coalescentstr, points are located around the diagonal line. points in the plot for coalescentstr  are also located around the diagonal line, but scattered in larger area than those in the plot for coalescentstr. in the plot for the basic model, the sum of estimated repeat numbers is not correlated with the sum of true repeat numbers because the amount data for each individual in this experiment is not sufficient for estimating repeat numbers correctly. since lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper could not detect str variants for any sample, only a horizontal line with the value twice as much as the reference repeat number is observed in the plots for lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper.

performance evaluation with wgs data
we applied coalescentstr and other existing methods to wgs data of a hapmap ceu individual, na <dig> from hiseq  <dig> to estimate numbers of cac repeats at chr1:20200573- <dig> in grch <dig> for na <dig>  read length and average insert size of the wgs data are respectively  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, and its read coverage is  <dig> ×. the data was provided by the illumina platinum genomes project through the european nucleotide archive under the study accession prjeb <dig> . in addition to the wgs data of na <dig>  we used wgs data for  <dig> hapmap ceu and  <dig> hapmap gbr individuals released in may,  <dig>   <dig> by 1kgp  <cit> . read length and read coverage of the wgs data of these  <dig> individual is  <dig> bp and  <dig> ×, respectively. sequence reads in the wgs data of na <dig> were aligned with bwa-mem while those in the wgs of others were aligned with bwa  <cit> . phased genotypes around the str region for coalescentstr were obtained from the 1kgp phase <dig> imputation panels released in october,  <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . for sampling coalescent trees, phased genotypes at  <dig>  bp upstream and downstream positions of the str region were used. an str mutation rate was selected from { <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> } based on the value given by eq. . nmax and nmin were set to  <dig> and zero, respectively.

the size of the str region is  <dig> bp in the reference genome, and it is difficult to estimate repeat numbers in the region by directly counting repeat numbers in the aligned reads for the data of read length of  <dig> bp due to the lack of aligned bases to the flanking regions in spanning reads. thus, we estimated repeat numbers estimated from high coverage sequencing data with long reads, and used the estimated repeat numbers as true repeat numbers for the evaluation. for sequencing data with long reads, pacbio sequencing data for na <dig> provided from giab reference materials and data   <cit>  was used, and repeat numbers were estimated by the following procedures: 
error-corrected reads with falcon  in fasta format were aligned to grch <dig> with bwa-mem.

the number of bases aligned in the str region was counted for each read spanning the region.

two-component gaussian mixture model was applied to the set of numbers of bases obtained the above, and estimated means for two components divided by the size of the repeat pattern were adopted as estimated repeat numbers.



the estimated repeat numbers from the above procedures were  <dig>  and  <dig>  and used for the evaluation by calculating rmse given as follows: 
 12min{2+ <dig> +2},  where n^ <dig> and n^ <dig> are estimated repeat numbers for na <dig>  the estimated repeat numbers from coalescentstr, coalescentstr , the basic model, lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper and their corresponding rmse values with the repeat numbers estimated from the pacbio data are summarized in table  <dig>  since no variant was detected by lobstr and repeatseq, the reference repeat number,  <dig>  was assigned to their estimated results. similarly to the results in the former real data experiment, coalescentstr gives the best rmse and the basic model gives the worst rmse.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed a statistical approach named coalescentstr to estimate repeat numbers in an str region for multiple individuals from insert size data obtained by paired-end reads in hts data. we considered the genealogy of the multiple individuals and used the genealogy for propagating repeat number information from insert size among individuals to achieve more accurate estimation of repeat numbers. we evaluated the performance of coalescentstr, the basic model, lobstr, repeatseq, and strviper from simulation data and real data from 1kgp and verified the effectiveness of coalescentstr for str regions longer than or equal to the read length.

for computational time, coalescentstr requires the most computational time from the comparison with other existing methods, and its computational time is mainly taken by sampling coalescent trees with mcmc. the use of mcmc with approximate bayesian computation   <cit>  is a solution addressing this issue because the calculation of likelihood for each sampled tree is avoided with abc and the calculation mainly requires the computational time for sampling. for larger size of genome structural variations such as large size copy number variations, the recombination of genomes needs to be considered although the recombination is basically not considered in coalescent theory. we are considering to extend the proposed model in future work in order to use ancestral recombination graph, which can handle the recombination in the genealogy of multiple individuals unlike coalescent tree.
