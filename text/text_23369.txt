BACKGROUND
in dogs, spinocerebellar ataxia  is characterized by progressive incoordination of gait, loss of balance, hypermetric and spastic movements. this condition may be associated with changes of brainstem auditory evoked potentials, myokymia, neuromyotonia and muscle fasciculation or seizures .

hereditary ataxia is classified according to different aspects like age of onset  and location of the pathomorphological lesions   <cit> . in parson  and jack russell terriers  lesions were found in the spinal cord and in the brain  <cit> . in fox terriers, lesions were only present in the spinal cord  <cit> , whereas a more recent study reported histopathological degenerative changes in the brainstem  <cit> . histopathological examinations of the central nervous system in prt and jrt demonstrated a bilateral symmetrical myelopathy, predominantly a neuronal axonopathy in the dorsal and ventral or ventromedial funiculi  <cit> . loss of axons and myelin and astrogliosis were primarily seen in the spinocerebellar tracts of the cervical cord but were also present in all parts of the brain  <cit> .

a complex segregation analysis using regressive logistic models was performed to elucidate the mode of inheritance in prt and jrt  <cit> . the data included  <dig> pedigrees with a total of  <dig> dogs, either jrt or prt, and  <dig> affected with the typical clinical signs and 9/ <dig> with a histopathological examination showing a bilateral symmetric myelopathy in the nervous system. a monogenic mode of inheritance could be clearly ruled out. mixed models with a major gene effect and a polygenic model were most likely for these pedigrees. the analysis could not differentiate how many loci may segregate in these two dog breeds.

in jrt, prt and related breeds, the missense mutation c.627c > g in the kcnj <dig>  gene  was found to be strongly associated with spinocerebellar ataxia   <cit> . this kcnj <dig> variant was identified screening a whole-genome sequence of a single jrt with spinocerebellar ataxia and myokymia under the assumptions of an autosomal recessive inheritance and a mutation altering the protein structure. data filtering included other  <dig> canids that had not shown sca. affected animals showed ataxia, myokymia and/or seizures beginning from 2– <dig> months of age. the spinal cord sections revealed a bilateral myelopathy. brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities and hearing loss was not evident  <cit> .

a missense mutation in the capn <dig> gene  was associated with a late-onset spinocerebellar ataxia phenotype  in a cohort of prt  <cit> . signs of symmetric spinocerebellar ataxia had been noticed in affected dogs between  <dig> and 12 months of age. the capn <dig> missense mutation c.344g > a was identified using a genome-wide association study  followed by the massively parallel sequencing of affected and control prt for the loa-associated chromosomal interval.

the objectives of this study were to perform a genome-wide association study  in prt for hereditary ataxia using the canine illumina high density bead chip and then to show whether the previously reported sca- and loa-associated kcnj <dig> and capn <dig> genes in prt and jrt are in windows of significantly associated genomic regions. in addition, we sequenced kcnj <dig> and validated the previously reported kcnj <dig> and capn <dig> mutations in prt and jrt and further control samples of other breeds of dog.

methods
we collected edta-blood samples from  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt whereof  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt were clinically affected by sca . all  <dig> cases were presented at the clinic for small animals, university of veterinary medicine hannover. controls did not show any signs of ataxia, myokymia or seizures based on medical records of practitioners and clinical examinations at the clinic for small animals, hannover. in addition, controls had to be >4 years of age. for  <dig> prt a pedigree could be constructed. a subsample of the cases for the present study had been previously described elsewhere  <cit> . in brief, all clinically affected dogs showed symmetric generalized ataxia with hypermetric and spastic movements in all  <dig> legs at 2– <dig> months of age. generalized seizures were observed in some cases. in all affected dogs clinical signs worsened and had to be euthanized at an age < <dig>  years. all dogs had their origin in germany. out of the  <dig> clinically sca-affected prt cases,  <dig> were confirmed through a histopathological examination. in all examined  <dig> prt, a bilateral symmetrical myelopathy was evident. predominantly an axonopathy combined with myelin loss, in the dorsal and ventral or ventromedial funiculi was seen. swelling of axons and dilatation of myelin sheaths with loss of myelin adjacent to a mild astrogliosis were observed primarily in the spinocerebellar tracts of the cervical cord but were also observed in all parts of the brain.

genomic dna was isolated using standard methods with rbc  lysis buffer and se  buffer. the dna concentration of the samples was adjusted to 50 ng/μl using the nanodrop nd- <dig>  and quality control was performed by gel electrophoresis using 1 % agarose gels .

we performed a gwas in  <dig> prt using the canine illumina high density beadchip  containing  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms . the data set included  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. out of these  <dig> cases,  <dig> had a histopathological examination confirming the clinical diagnosis. controls had to be unrelated with the cases at the parent level and >4 years of age. among controls,  <dig> were male and  <dig> female. cases included  <dig> males and  <dig> females. after quality control , filtering for minor allele frequency > <dig>  and hardy-weinberg equilibrium   using sas/genetics, version  <dig>  ,  <dig>  snps were left for the analysis.

the gwas was performed with a general linear model. the analysis was run using tassel, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the glm explained for sex effects and the snp genotypes. in addition, we tested several extended models employing up to five principal components  to show the robustness of the outcome of the gwas. all these models yielded the same genome-wide associated snps as the glm model. thus, adding principal components for cryptic data structure did not change the results of the glm model. a plot of the first two pcas for cases and controls employed for the gwas is shown in additional file  <dig>  we applied the bonferroni correction to determine the threshold for genome-wide significance in order to avoid false-positive associations. the bonferroni correction set the threshold for significance at  <dig> / <dig>  =  <dig> e− <dig> for a p-value of  <dig> . a sex-stratified case-control analysis was performed using sas/genetics, version  <dig>  . homozygosity mapping was done in sliding windows with a minimum of  <dig> consecutive homozygous snps within a range of 50 kb using plink, version  <dig>   <cit> .

a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism  for a sample of  <dig> prt,  <dig> jrt from germany and  <dig> controls from  <dig> different dog breeds was employed for genotyping the capn1:c.344g > a and kcnj10:c.627c > g mutations. the design of primers was carried out using primer  <dig>  and the dog genome assembly canfam <dig>  .

the gene model we used for kcnj <dig> was based on the transcript xm_ <dig>  of the dog genome assembly canfam <dig>  . this transcript includes three exons whereof only two exons  are translated into a protein with  <dig> amino acids . a previous study  <cit>  used the transcript xm_ <dig>  as gene model  with two exons encoding  <dig> aa. exon  <dig> and  <dig> of kcnj <dig> and their adjacent genomic regions were sequenced in  <dig> prt  and  <dig> jrt  using an abi  <dig> genetic analyzer  . in total,  <dig> genetic variants were detected in these  <dig> dogs. exon  <dig> could not be amplified because several prime pairs designed for this canine genomic region or primer pairs designed from other species including human, mouse and rat did not result in amplicons with the expected size nor the amplicons could be sequenced. the exon  <dig> region did not seem to be correctly annotated in the dog reference genome and thus, may prevent retrieval of possible genetic variants for kcnj <dig> exon  <dig> in whole genome sequence data.

in addition, we tried to amplify the gene kcnj <dig>  annotated at  <dig> ,627– <dig> , <dig> base pairs  on dog chromosome   <dig> . the record of this gene contained large gaps. we searched for canine expressed sequence tags  using the canine coding sequence of kcnj <dig> and the basic local alignment tool  of ncbi . the best hit with an e-value of 1e− <dig> and a total score of  <dig>  of this search did not fit to the genomic region where kcnj <dig> was annotated in the dog genome reference assembly. the same was found for hits with larger e-values. therefore, we were not able to build a gene model for kcnj <dig> or sequence this gene.

all kcnj <dig> genetic variants detected in the  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt were further evaluated by sequencing kcnj <dig> from one dog of  <dig> other breeds. these dogs had a normal phenotype in regard to sca and included the following breeds: akita, bernese mountain dog, dalmatian, german drahthaar, german shepherd, irish wolfhound, shar pei, tibetan terrier and briard. analysis of sequencing results had been performed using sequencher software, version  <dig>  . the evaluation study resulted in  <dig> private variants for prt and jrt. we then filtered the  <dig> genetic variants for homozygous mutant genotypes in affected prt and jrt. the single nucleotide variant  reported in a previous study  <cit>  and only one other variant  remained. validation of this result was performed in further  <dig> prt. we developed a test on a li-cor  <dig> dna analyzer  using a 167-bp amplicon . the forward primer was labelled with ird <dig> at the 5′end. all samples of the  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt as well as  <dig> dogs from  <dig> other different breeds were used to generate the kcnj10:g.22141027insc containing amplicon. the amplicons were size-fractionated using gel electrophoresis on an automated sequencer li-cor  <dig> dna analyzer on 6 % polyacrylamide denaturing gels. allele sizes were scored against ird700-labeled dna ladders . for bioinformatic analysis of the effects of the kcnj10:g.22141027insc variant we used the complete fasta-sequence of kcnj <dig> and employed the regulatory rna motifs and elements finder    <cit>  and the variant effect predictor .

RESULTS
genome-wide association study
the gwas using  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls identified three genome-wide significantly associated snps on dog chromosome  <dig>   and a quantile-quantile plot  for expected versus observed –log10
p-values was calculated to control for population stratification . all snps with –log10p-values > <dig> are located on cfa <dig> and were in hwe. the genomic inflation factor was equal to  <dig>  indicative that data stratification had no effect on the outcomes of the gwas. the significantly associated snps are located at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb  and at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb  on cfa <dig> with the strongest signal at  <dig>  mb . the p-values for the snps with the highest associations after bonferroni-correction were at  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig> ×10− <dig>  . in the associated interval, 9/ <dig> cases and one control shared a homozygous region over  <dig> consecutive snps spanning 1893 kb at  <dig> ,952– <dig> ,713 bp  and at  <dig> ,358– <dig> , <dig> . inclusion of further two cases resulted in an even shorter homozygous interval with a size of 124 kb. however, for all other cases, an extended homozygosity region could not be determined . this may indicate that hereditary ataxia had its origin in several founders or recombinations broke down the homozygous identical-by-descent region caused by a common founder to a very small region not detectable via the beadchip data.

a potential candidate gene in the associated and homozygous interval is kcnj <dig> at  <dig> ,668– <dig> ,816 bp  and at  <dig> ,718– <dig> ,618 bp   <cit> . the two closest and significantly associated snps are  <dig>   and  <dig>   bp downstream to kcnj <dig>  an association was not evident for snps on cfa <dig> where capn <dig> is located. the gene kcnj <dig> could not be verified using expressed sequence tags  for searching this region. other candidate genes could not be detected in the associated interval. further members of the kcnj-gene family were not considered because the gwas did not indicate significant signals on locations outside cfa <dig> 

genotyping capn <dig> and kcnj <dig> variants

capn <dig> genotyping results showed that all  <dig> prt and  <dig> jrt were homozygous wild-type. genotyping the kcnj10:c.627c > g mutation revealed 38/ <dig> prt  with the wild-type, 22/ <dig>  as heterozygous and 17/ <dig>  as homozygous mutated. in 1/ <dig> of the homozygous wild-type tested prt, hereditary ataxia was clinically and histopathologically confirmed. two other homozygous wild-type tested prt were diagnosed to be affected after clinical examination and/or according to the report of the owner. among jrt, only 1/ <dig> dogs was homozygously affected and 7/ <dig> heterozygous. each one of the heterozygous and homozygous wild-type jrt were clinically affected . in addition,  <dig> controls from  <dig> different dog breeds were genotyped for both mutations. all these dogs were homozygous wild-type for both mutations .table  <dig> distribution of ataxia phenotypes by the kcnj10:c.627c > g genotypes for parson russell  und jack russell terriers

sequencing kcnj10
in order to identify further mutations associated with hereditary ataxia explaining the cases with the homozygous kcnj <dig> c/c genotype, exon  <dig> and  <dig> of kcnj <dig> with their exon/intron or exon/utr boundaries were sequenced in prt and jrt. we included  <dig> affected prt with the homozygous kcnj <dig> c/c genotype and all  <dig> affected jrt with the different kcnj <dig> genotypes. in addition, we sequenced  <dig> prt  with the concordant kcnj <dig> genotype. a total of  <dig> genetic variants could be identified including  <dig> single nucleotide variants  and  <dig> indels   whereof most of them were located in the 3′utr  . sequencing further  <dig> dogs of other breeds  and filtering showed  <dig> variants private for prt and jrt . a further filtering for homozygous mutant genotypes in affected prt and jrt resulted in a 1-bp-insertion  prevalent in these animals. this 1-bp-insertion was located within a stretch of  <dig> consecutive c bases . bioinformatic analysis using regrna indicated the kcnj10:g.22141027insc affecting regulation of gene expression via a regulatory rna motif or mirna target site. a regulatory rna motif  was identified 6 bp downstream to the kcnj10:g.22141027insc. the motif of the mirna  target site contains the kcnj10:g.22141027insc . genotyping a pedigree containing  <dig> prt for both mutations, kcnj10:g.22141027insc and kcnj10:c.627c > g, showed segregation of both mutations with the affection status with exception of one animal . genotyping results of the kcnj10:g.22141027insc are summarized in table  <dig>  out of the  <dig> prt,  <dig>  showed the wild-type,  <dig>  the heterozygous and  <dig>  the homozygous mutated genotype. in 2/ <dig> of the heterozygous prt, hereditary ataxia was clinically and histopathologically confirmed and 2/ <dig> homozygous wild-type tested prt were affected according to a clinical examination and/or according to the report of the owner. the genotyping results for the kcnj10:g.22141027insc mutation of jrt showed two homozygous mutated genotypes among the affected individuals. a further affected individual had the wildtype genotype. genotyping further  <dig> dogs of  <dig> other breed dogs revealed  <dig>  wildtype homozygous,  <dig>  heterozygous and  <dig>  homozygous mutated genotypes .table  <dig> distribution of ataxia phenotypes by the kcnj10:g.22141027insc genotypes for parson russell  und jack russell terriers

discussion
the results of the gwas indicate that the associated genomic region on cfa <dig> may harbour the most likely candidate genes for hereditary ataxia in the sample under study. thus, our study corroborated the previous candidate gene search using whole genome sequence data  <cit> . we could not detect samples with the capn1:c.344g > a mutation. this may indicate that this mutation may be rare in the german prt and jrt populations. in agreement with a previous study  <cit> , one histopathologically confirmed case of hereditary ataxia and two clinically affected cases carried neither the capn1:c.344g > a allele nor the homozygous kcnj10:c.627c > g genotype. this may indicate that at least one further mutation may be involved in hereditary ataxia of prt and jrt. as the largest proportion of affected dogs were concordant with the segregation of the kcnj10:c.627c > g alleles the remaining unexplained cases may harbour a rare mutation. however, breeders have to be aware that selective breeding based on genetic tests for the kcnj10:c.627c > g and capn1:c.344g > a mutations cannot completely preclude affected dogs of the breeds prt or jrt despite of homozygous wild-type genotypes of the parents.

the present sequence analysis tagged a 1-bp-insertion associated with hereditary ataxia in prt and jrt. this mutation may have an effect on regulation of kcnj <dig> expression as indicated through bioinformatic results from regrna. however, the presence of this 1-bp-insertion in other breeds may require further research in phenotyping spinocerebellar ataxia associated with myokymia, seizures, or both. in conclusion, a few but not all cases of hereditary ataxia being heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type allele of kcnj <dig> could be explained by the kcnj10:g.22141027insc mutation.

CONCLUSIONS
our data confirmed the presence of the kcnj10:c.627c > g mutation in prt and jrt affected with hereditary ataxia. however, some cases of hereditary ataxia could not be explained through the kcnj10:c.627c > g nor the capn1:c.344g > a mutation. genetic testing using the kcnj10:c.627c > g and the capn1:c.344g > a mutations deems not to be sufficient to capture all cases of hereditary ataxia in prt and jrt. this lets us assume that at least one additional form of hereditary ataxia may segregate in the breeds prt and jrt. the kcnj10:g.22141027insc mutation was evident in a few cases but could not explain all not yet resolved cases. further efforts are necessary to collect cases of hereditary ataxia not explained by the presently known mutations to unravel the responsible mutations in these cases of hereditary ataxia.
