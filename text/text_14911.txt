BACKGROUND
the development of animals and plants is dependent on undifferentiated stem cells residing in special locations called niches  <cit> . in a plant, stem cells are maintained in the shoot apical meristem  throughout its life, and the sam is the source of all aerial parts of the plant  <cit> .

spatial regions of different expression patterns and functions are found within the sam. the central zone is located at the tip of the apex and consists of slowly dividing stem cells expressing the clavata <dig>  gene. due to cellular growth and proliferation, stem cells from the central zone move into the surrounding tissue where the spatial location of each daughter cell is a main determinant of cell fate. located below the central zone is a small group of cells that are believed to form a control zone for the organization of the sam. these cells express the wushel  gene, which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor and has been shown to be required for maintaining stem cells in the shoot  <cit> . although not expressed in the same cells, wus and clv <dig> regulate the expression of each other. while wus upregulates clv <dig>  the intercellular peptide clv <dig> acts together with the receptor kinase clavata <dig>  in a signaling pathway that downregulates wus  <cit> . this feedback network is a main regulator of stem cell maintenance in the sam. if the number of stem cells is low the clv <dig> signal will be weak and expression of wus will in-crease, which in turn will induce clv <dig> expression. if instead there is an abundance of stem cells, wus will be downregulated and clv <dig> expression will decrease.

additional molecules have been identified to be important for sam development. the receptor-like clavata <dig>  is involved in wus repression acting within the clv <dig> signaling path-way  <cit> . müller et al.   <cit>  recently identified a kinase coryne  that interacts with clv <dig> and together form a receptor for clv <dig>  in addition, the bam family of receptors has an antagonistic effect compared to clavata <dig> in stem cell regulation  <cit> , and several members of the cle  ligand family were shown to affect the sam development in perturbation assays  <cit> . the intracellular components of the wus-repressing signal are to a large extent unknown, but poltergeist  and poltergeist-like <dig>  have been shown to be important for mediating the signal  <cit> . in addition, hormonal signaling and chromatin remodeling has been implicated in the regulation of wuschel  <cit> .

reduction in clavata signaling leads to increased wus and clv <dig> expressions and an increase in number of stem cells and shoot size  <cit>  as well as an increased number of carpels produced in flowers. a number of clv <dig> alleles have been shown to have different strengths in these phenotypic traits. somewhat unintuitively, the clv1- <dig> null-mutant was shown to have a weaker phenotype than the non-null clv1- <dig> mutant  <cit> . müller et al.   <cit>  also found that the crn- <dig> clv1- <dig> double mutant showed weaker phenotype than the crn- <dig> clv1- <dig> double mutant. it was suggested that the stronger phenotype of the clv1- <dig> mutant compared to the null mutant is due to a functional overlap between multiple receptors, and that the dominant effect of clv1- <dig> could relate to cross-talk with other receptors  <cit> . with the identification of crn/clv <dig>  this receptor was suggested to be the target for interference by the mutated clv <dig>  <cit> .

several theoretical models have been used to investigate different aspects of the stem cell regulatory network in the sam  <cit> . for example, spatial models using static cell-based sam templates have been used to investigate how the wus-activated clv <dig> expression region could be localized to the central zone, and how wus may be spatially activated via a pattern-forming mechanism  <cit> . the intracellular wus activation network has been further investigated showing the importance of the hormone cytokinin for wus activation  <cit> , and a cell-population based model has been used to investigate uncoupling of the sizes of the clv <dig> and wus domains at different growth conditions  <cit> .

none of the published models have included multiple receptor pathways for the wus-repressing signal, and in this paper we use computational modeling to investigate details of receptor and ligand turnover, interactions, and signaling. we focus on the differences in receptor mutants, where the main question is how a clv1- <dig> null mutant can have a weaker phenotype than a clv1- <dig> non-null mutant in the context of phenotypes for a number of single and double receptor mutants. we develop two models capturing the main aspects of the negative feedback loop for stem cell regulation. in the models, clv <dig> binds to both clv <dig> and crn/clv <dig> receptors, the bound receptors propagate a combined signal repressing wus, and wus induces clv <dig> production. the two models only differ in the implementation of the clv1- <dig> non-null mutant. the first model is used to test the proposed idea of receptor interference as an explanation of the differences in phenotypes of clv <dig> mutants and the second model is used to test a more parsimonious loss-of-signal mutant hypothesis. a motivation for the second model is that the clv1- <dig> has been identified as a missense mutation in the kinase part of the receptor  <cit> .

a common problem for modeling biological systems is the abundance of unknown values for the kinetic reaction parameters. to address this problem we use a parameter ensemble approach, where we for each model extract a number of parameter sets, chosen for the ability of the model  to explain data from multiple mutant experiments  <cit> . for each model of the clv1- <dig> mutant, the parameter sets provide a semiglobal description of the model behavior, instead of a more parameter value dependent description that results if a single parameter set would be used.

we apply statistical tools on the parameter sets to obtain predictions about biological properties of the stem cell regulating network resulting from introducing the hypothesized mechanisms for the clv1- <dig> mutant.

RESULTS
we implemented the stem cell regulatory network as a system of ordinary differential equations  using standard mass action kinetics for molecular reactions . the model consists of two receptors, clv <dig> and crn , that when bound to clv <dig> repress wus expression, and wus-induced clv <dig> expression.

models of two clv1- <dig> hypotheses are both able to explain data from wild type and six receptor mutant experiments
to objectively obtain parameter values we compared the models with experimental data from wild type and the four receptor loss-of-function mutants clv1- <dig>  clv1- <dig>  crn- <dig>  and crn- <dig> clv2- <dig> . we implemented clv1- <dig> and crn- <dig> clv2- <dig> as null mutants, removing the receptors from the model, and the crn- <dig> as a complete loss-of-signal mutant  <cit>  . the clv1- <dig> mutant is implemented either as a loss-of-signal mutant  or by adding an interference mechanism acting on the crn receptor pathway . to compare phenotypic strength between a model and experiments, we used wus levels as a measure in the models and compared with carpel numbers, which represent an experimental estimate of phenotypic strength, see e.g.  <cit>  .

we used an optimization algorithm to find candidates for parameter values  <cit>  and performed multiple optimizations to get an ensemble of parameter  sets for each of the two models . we performed  <dig>  optimizations for each model and kept only parameter sets for which the model was able to reproduce data observed in the experiments . for the two models the optimization algorithm found  <dig>   and  <dig>   valid parameter sets .

given that the number of parameters in the model exceeded the number of available experiments, it was important to lower the tendency of over fitting. hence we applied double mutants as an a posteriori validation step, where we compared data from simulations with data from the two double loss-of-function and null-mutants crn- <dig> clv1- <dig> and crn- <dig> clv1- <dig> , keeping only parameter sets for which the models were able to explain the double mutants . we observed that for most parameter sets the models showed too strong phenotypes for the double mutants , and after the validation only  <dig>  and  <dig>  parameter sets remained. the strong double mutant phenotypes in the simulations can be explained by the lack of other dynamic input to the wus repression in the model, except for the two pathways that are knocked out.

experiments used in the optimization and validation steps to find parameter values. the first four mutants  are single-receptor mutants and are used in the optimization step. the remaining two double mutants are left for the validation step. carpel number values and standard errors are from  <cit> . the threshold errors are the errors used to find valid parameter sets in the optimization and validation steps.

in conclusion, the loss-of-signal and interference models are both able to reproduce data seen in wild type, four single receptor, and two double receptor mutant experiments.

the loss-of-signal hypothesis implies sequestration of clv <dig> for the clv1- <dig> mutant
the difference between the two models is in the implementation of the clv1- <dig> mutant, which in each case is described by a single parameter - k <dig>  weak for the loss-of-signal model and k <dig> for the interference model. for the loss-of-signal model, we observed that the average clv1/clv <dig> signal in the mutant  is an order of magnitude smaller than the wild type signal  , meaning that the model indeed shows a loss-of-signal behavior. likewise, we observed for the interference model that the average interference strength in the mutant  is an order of magnitude larger than the receptor turnover rates  . this simple sanity check confirmed that the hypothesized clv1- <dig> - mechanisms were effective in the models when using the parameter sets obtained from the optimization and validation steps.

the stronger phenotype of the clv1- <dig> mutant requires that the crn pathway signal is weaker in the clv1- <dig> mutant compared with the clv1- <dig> null mutant. for the interference model this requirement is fulfilled by the interference mechanism itself since crn receptors are made unavailable for binding when interfered by the mutated clv <dig> in the clv1- <dig> mutant.

for the loss-of-signal mutant it is not as obvious how the crn pathway signal can be weaker in the clv1- <dig> mutant than in the clv1- <dig> null mutant, but since the clv1- <dig> protein product still binds clv <dig> it could sequester clv <dig>  making it unavailable for the crn pathway. this would indirectly affect the signal strength of the crn pathway. for the clv1- <dig> null mutant no clv <dig> is present to bind to clv <dig> leading to an increase of bound crn receptors. to verify this intuitive explanation, we investigated the amounts of free clv <dig> and bound crn receptors in the different clv <dig> mutants. as expected we observed that both models had a lower amount of bound crn receptors in the clv1- <dig> mutant than in the clv1- <dig> null mutant , although the mechanisms for achieving this differed. furthermore, the clv1- <dig> loss-of-signal mutant had lower levels of free clv <dig>  confirming the sequestration of clv <dig> . in contrast, for the interference model we observed no signs of clv <dig> sequestration .

taken together these results show that the loss-of-signal model utilizes sequestration of clv <dig> in the clv1- <dig> mutant in order to generate a stronger phenotype than the clv1- <dig> null mutant. the interference model, on the other hand, uses interference between the receptor pathways and simulations suggest that the model is less constrained by experimental data to achieve this result , as was also indicated by the number of parameter sets that passed the validation step for the two models.

the two clv1- <dig> hypotheses leads to differences in properties of the unperturbed stem cell regulating network
each model had a large ensemble of parameters after the optimization and validation steps. since the wild type stem cell regulating networks of the two models are identical, there are no a priori reasons for the parameter values of the models - excluding the parameters unique for each implementation of the clv1- <dig> mutant - to differ. to analyze differences in parameter values we generated a hypothesis-neutral background distribution by optimizing the model without using the clv1- <dig> mutant. we performed  <dig>  optimizations and for  <dig>  parameter sets the model was able to reproduce the wild type and the three single mutant experiments. these parameter sets were used as a background parameter distribution for the two models in the proceeding analysis.

we performed a principal component analysis  on the joint parameters of the models. interestingly, we observed that there was a clear separation both between the distributions coming from the two models, and between those of the individual models and the background distribution . this showed that the introduction of the two hypotheses for the clv1- <dig> mutant leads to differences in the properties of the unperturbed stem cell regulating network.

to further analyze the differences between the models we compared each parameter individually between the two models and the background by using receiver operating characteristics  curves, where we used the area under the roc-curve  to quantify differences between the three parameter distributions   <cit> . we generated sorted lists of the auc values , and some parameters showed differences between either clv1- <dig> model and the background.

the results from the analysis step, comparing parameter value distributions of the two models with the background distribution. parameters are sorted by area under roc curves . the parameters under the line have a p-value greater than  <dig>  and are not statistically significant, where p-values are calculated with a wilcoxon rank-sum test. see also fig.  <dig> 

to highlight features of each model we studied the parameters that differed the most in more detail to find out how they relate to biological mechanisms. we noted that the hill parameters  were among the top candidates for both hypotheses . these parameters tune the regulation of wus by the combined pathway . the validation step did introduce large constraints on the parameters , and it is likely that fitting the parameters to the double mutant experiments led to a tighter regulation of the hill parameters. to confirm this, we did an auc parameter comparison between data after the optimization step and data after the validation step, wherein both hill parameters appeared among the top three parameters . we also did an auc comparison between the two models' data sets, and in this case the hill parameters did not show up at the top of the list . as a consequence of these results we did not look further into these two parameters, but focused on the receptor ligand dynamics.

we chose, somewhat ad hoc, to make a cut in auc at  <dig>  for this analysis. the comparison between the loss-of-signal hypothesis and the background emphasized two parameters. the strength of the clv1/clv <dig> signal into the cell  and the clv <dig> turnover rate  . the comparison between the interference hypothesis and background also highlighted two parameters, which in this case were the production rates for the two receptors  .

in conclusion we have shown that parameter calibration of the different implementations of the clv1- <dig> mutants imposes non-expected constraints on the parameters of the two models, and in the further analysis we found four parameters that were the most discriminating between the models. these four parameters will be used in the proceeding analysis to evaluate their consequences from a biological perspective.

the wus-repressing signal is dependent on both receptor pathways with a slightly stronger clv1-dependence
the parameter that differed the most in the comparison between the loss-of-signal and background distributions was k <dig> , wherein it was larger for the loss-of-signal model. this is not surprising since k <dig> sets the strength of the signal from the bound clv <dig> receptor and the loss-of-signal mutant needs to be able to reduce this signaling strength for the clv1- <dig> mutant.

the selection of k <dig> may also be an indication that it is important for the loss-of-signal model that the clv1/clv <dig> pathway is stronger than the crn/clv <dig> pathway. in our implementation the strength of the former is given by k <dig> times the concentration of bound clv <dig> receptors, and the latter is given by k <dig> times the concentration of bound crn receptors. we observed that the clv <dig> pathway indeed was slightly stronger for both models  and this effect was somewhat stronger for the loss-of-signal model. however, the asymmetry between the two pathways was fairly small and it is obvious that the wus-repressing signal is dependent on both pathways. by only considering the wild type network, one might assume that using double pathways would mean that the strengths of the two could be freely tuned. if the strength of one of the pathways is increased, the increase could be compensated by decreasing the other to obtain the same combined signal. this was however not what we observed in our analysis. in contrast, when also taking the mutants into account it is important to divide the signal evenly between the two pathways, but with a slightly stronger clv <dig> pathway signal . this is true for both models, as was also suggested by the mutant experiments since the clv <dig> phenotypes are slightly stronger than the crn phenotypes .

degradation or internalization of the bound receptor is implicated by the loss-of-signal clv1- <dig> hypothesis
the second parameter highlighted for the loss-of-signal model, from the comparison with the background distribution, was t <dig> . the t <dig> parameter sets the turnover rate of the clv <dig> receptor, including the degradation of the bound receptor . the loss-of-signal model typically had a larger value of this parameter. interestingly, this was in accordance with our finding that the loss-of-signal model without degradation of the bound clv <dig> receptor could not cohere with all mutant data simultaneously . together these results predict that for the loss-of-signal model to work the bound clv <dig> receptor needs to be removed from the membrane, possibly via internalization.

receptor trafficking has been suggested to be important for several cell-signaling pathways  <cit>  and endosomal functions play major role in plants  <cit> . although there has been no experimental evidence for clv <dig> internalization, other receptors such as fsl <dig> and bri have been shown to be internalized  <cit> . recent gfp-data of clv <dig> indicates that clv <dig> is located mainly in the plasma membrane but can also be found in internal cell compartments  <cit> . the model suggests that there should be a non-negligible rate of internalization of the bound clv <dig> receptor.

the interference hypothesis leads to large quantities of receptors
from the comparison between the interference model and the background distribution it was seen that the parameters for receptor production, s <dig> and s <dig>  are large in the interference model . this suggests that the interference model requires large quantities of receptors to reproduce the differences in phenotype of the clv1- <dig> non-null mutant and the clv1- <dig> null mutant. an explanation could be that there must be enough receptors available for the interference mechanism to be efficient. when comparing the amount of free receptors with the amount of free clv <dig> in wild type simulations, we observed that there was an abundance of receptors . it can be noted that large quantities of both receptors are present . as a comparison, the background distribution data did not show any bias towards an abundance of free receptors .

in addition, we compared the amount of bound versus free receptors , and only the interference model data displayed a bias towards more free than bound receptors in the wild type simulations. from a biological point of view, the strategy of having large amounts of free receptors might not be advantageous given the metabolic cost associated with the production of receptors. however, the optimization algorithm does not take metabolic costs into consideration and it might be that, if it had, the result could be different. the addition of metabolic cost would be an interesting improvement of the optimization algorithm that could be tested.

at this point, we have examined all parameters highlighted by the auc value, but our threshold value for choosing parameters to scrutinize was somewhat ad hoc. hence it could be of interest to briefly investigate the parameters that follow in the sorted list . the clv <dig> production rate  is lower and the unbinding rate of the clv1/clv <dig> complex  is higher for the interference model compared to the background distribution, acting in directions of having low clv <dig> and much unbound receptor, strengthening the conclusions in this section. for the loss-of-function model the crn production rate  and the unbinding rate of the crn/clv <dig> complex  are high, acting in the direction of having much unbound crn, which we could see in the simulated data . unbound crn acts in favor of clv <dig> sequestration in the clv1- <dig> mutant, strengthening our sequestration discussion above.

in conclusion, our model analysis pinpointed the receptor abundance as important for both receptors in the interference model and also for the crn receptor in the loss-of-function model. it would be interesting to see how these predictions relate to experimental data, especially the somewhat counterintuitive prediction that there is a large pool of inactivated receptors.

additional perturbations
although the clv <dig> feedback is simplified in the model , it is of interest to analyze the model behavior for different clv <dig> perturbations since these have been extensively studied in experiments. loss-of-function clv <dig> mutants show an increase in wus expression, and gain-of-function mutants repress wus  <cit> . simulated perturbations where clv <dig> production was changed an order of magnitude up and down are presented in figure 6e. the models correctly predicted an increase of wus as the clv <dig> was lowered and a decrease when clv <dig> was increased. however, it has been shown in more detailed clv <dig> perturbation experiments that it is possible to change clv <dig> expression strength over a large range without any apparent phenotypical effects  <cit> . this was not captured in our clv <dig> perturbation simulations  and hence the model only qualitatively predicted the perturbations. this did not come as a surprise since we have focused our investigations on receptor mutants and we used a direct linear wus-dependent activation of clv <dig>  in reality clv <dig> is expressed in different cells compared to wus and the  regulation is possibly nonlinear. to introduce a spatial model would however require additional assumptions and hypotheses .

we also did a sensitivity analysis of individual parameters and both models were robust to changes in most parameters , an important feature given that the stem cell regulation needs to be robust to environmental changes and stable over long periods of time.

CONCLUSIONS
the stem cell regulation network in the plant shoot apical meristem is a well-studied system given its necessity for aboveground plant development. the large amount of mutant phenotype data available together with several gaps in knowledge of network details call for computational modeling as a tool for understanding the complex regulation at a systems level.

we have developed a model for the stem cell regulation network based on the negative feedback loop between clv <dig> and wus and focused on clv3-receptor dynamics and mutants. the model takes into account a negative regulation of wus via two different - although merging - receptor pathways, clv <dig> and crn, as well as a wus-induced clv <dig> production. starting from the question how the clv1- <dig> null mutant can be weaker in phenotype compared to the non-null clv1- <dig> mutant, we scrutinized two models implementing different hypothesized mechanisms for the clv1- <dig> mutant.

in the first tested mechanism for clv1- <dig>  the mutated clv <dig> product interfered with the crn pathway, as previously suggested  <cit> . due to the interference, the crn signal is decreased in the clv1- <dig> mutant, as compared to the null mutant. since both pathways are decreased the phenotype becomes stronger. we could also conclude that this hypothesis led to the prediction that there is an abundance of receptors in relation to clv <dig> 

in the second model the clv1- <dig> mutant was implemented as a loss-of-signal mutant, i.e. the receptor still binds clv <dig> but no signal is propagated. we showed that the crn signal is decreased in the clv1- <dig> mutant compared to the null mutant due to sequestration of clv <dig> by the continued binding to the clv1-receptor. for this model to work it is necessary that the bound clv <dig> receptor is internalized or degraded.

the adopted approach for extracting parameter ensembles and using statistical methods when comparing different hypotheses is generally applicable for systems biology modeling and provides an objective approach for dealing with unknown parameters. a future improvement could be to adopt machinelearning techniques of cross-validation by selecting different mutants to be included in the optimization and validation sets and then merge into a single parameter ensemble.

our model represents a simplification of the system, most notably by disregarding spatial factors and not including all possible receptors and additional mechanisms known to be important for wus regulation. however, these simplifications allowed us to investigate multiple receptors with an almost complete set of receptor mutants. we were not able to discard any of the two clv1- <dig> hypotheses, but still we were able to deliver experimentally verifiable predictions for both hypotheses, also on general properties of the stem cell regulating network that are indirect consequences of the hypotheses that would have been difficult to predict by intuition alone. the loss-of-signal mechanism has the advantage that it is more parsimonious since it only affects the signaling capacity, which fits well with the allele's known mutation in the kinase domain. the interference mechanism, on the other hand, is less constrained and seems to have an easier task in producing the mutant results. in the end it is experiments that should resolve the issue and we hope that this investigation can serve as an inspiration both for new experiments and for modelers to include multiple receptors in models of plant stem cell regulation.
