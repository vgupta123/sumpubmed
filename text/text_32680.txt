BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells isolated from the inner cell mass of the early mammalian blastocyst-stage embryo retain pluripotency when cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts  in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor   <cit> . in the absence of lif and mef attachment, es cells spontaneously differentiate into multi-cellular aggregates termed embryoid bodies . although the spatial complexity of organogenesis is not established during eb maturation, the dynamics of gene expression closely mimic those which characterize early stages of mouse development  <cit> . thus, es cell differentiation is an excellent model system for the discovery of genes involved in developmental processes.

many studies have attempted to identify genes that define the stem cell state by mining for genes co-expressed in es cells and various other stem cell populations such as hematopoietic and neural stem cells  <cit> , or es cells and trophoblast stem cells  <cit> . some of these studies have been criticized because they were unable to define a similar cohort of stem cell genes  <cit> . also, this approach is likely to find co-expression of 'housekeeping' genes that are irrelevant to the stem cell state. more recently, dynamic expression profiling during es cell differentiation has been undertaken using various eb culture techniques  <cit>  and the addition of exogenous growth factors  <cit> . most of these studies followed differentiation for a short time period  due to inherent limitations of liquid or adherent cultures cell differentiation systems.

various platforms have been used to determine gene expression profiles, including differential display, sage  <cit>  and slide micro-arrays, such as those provided by affymetrix, agilent and compugen. in this study we employed illumina® sentrix mouse- <dig> oligo bead arrays  <cit> , which have ~ <dig> k probes that are largely based on the meebo set of transcripts, plus ests discovered as part of the fantom <dig> transcriptome project  <cit> , some alternatively employed exons, and a small subset of non-coding transcripts. this is a new, rich and sensitive platform for expression profiling  <cit> .

es cells were differentiated in methylcellulose cultures, which allowed consistent eb development over  <dig> days in either serum  <cit>  or defined serum-free media containing bmp <dig> , termed serum-freeb4l hereafter  <cit> . the dynamics of loss of stem cell gene expression and activation of epiblast and primitive streak gene expression programs were similar in serum and serum-freeb4l but qt clustering revealed a significant difference in mesoderm outcomes from day  <dig> onwards. in particular, cardiac gene expression was greater in serum-freeb4l whereas activation of the blood program was enhanced in serum.

high expression levels of kruppel-like factor  family members: klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> was detected in undifferentiated es cells, and confirmed by quantitative real time rt-pcr, indirect immuno-fluorescence and dna-binding assays. expression was down regulated rapidly upon differentiation and a different set of klfs: klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf1/eklf, were activated upon es cell differentiation. also, klf-binding sites were markedly over represented in the proximal promoters of most stem cell specific genes, suggesting possible direct regulation by klfs. we suggest a model in which the balance between self-renewal and differentiation is regulated by competitive occupancy of the proximal promoters of key stem cell genes such as zfp42/rex- <dig>  nanog, pou5f <dig>  lefty <dig> and lefty <dig>  and others such as the klf genes themselves.

RESULTS
differentiation of es cells in serum and serum-freeb4l culture
the directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into desirable cell types will depend upon the addition of specific growth factors to defined media and reproducible physical conditions of culture. to establish a baseline for such studies, we undertook a comparison of murine es cell differentiation using an embryoid body  methylcellulose culture system containing either 10% fbs  <cit>  or a chemically defined bsa-based media containing  <dig> ng/ml of bmp <dig>  termed serum-freeb4l  <cit> . triplicate experiments were performed in which es cells were harvested after feeder depletion, and set up in parallel eb cultures in serum versus serum-freeb4l. rna was collected at regular intervals up to  <dig> days, quantitative rt-pcr was performed on a panel of genes representing defined stages of development to establish the robustness of the culture system , and expression profiling was performed using illumina® sentrix mouse- <dig> bead arrays .

changes in gene expression were extremely reproducible across es differentiation experiments with overall correlation of global gene expression for biological replicates in the order or  <dig> – <dig> . approximately 30% of the probes were differentially expressed at one or more stages of eb differentiation as determined by one-way welch anova with multiple testing corrections using the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate algorithm  .

to mine for genes with similar patterns of expression across the time course, hierarchical clustering was performed on the  <dig>  probes and represented graphically. a large percentage of these  displayed highest expression in undifferentiated es cells and subsequent reduced expression over time . a second major cluster showed marked induction after ~day 4– <dig> of differentiation .

putative stem cell genes sets
previous studies have identified genes important to the stem cell state by comparing expression profiling data from different stem cell populations such as es cells, haematopoietic stem cells  and neural stem cells  <cit> . we used two alternative approaches to identify specific stem cell specific gene expression. firstly, genes with dynamic expression patterns which correlated closely with oct <dig>  sox <dig> or nanog expression profiles  were determined as previously described  <cit> . second, genes rapidly down regulated ≥ <dig> fold by day  <dig> of differentiation, a time point where es cell clonogenicity decreases dramatically, were determined. not surprisingly there was very little overlap between these gene lists, primarily because oct <dig> and nanog expression persists during eb differentiation longer than many other stem cell genes . full lists of genes ranked according to similarity of expression  with expression patterns for oct <dig>  nanog or sox <dig> are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  respectively.

only fifty-nine genes were down regulated ≥ <dig> fold by day  <dig> of eb differentiation . many of these have been identified as stem cell markers by other groups using alternative strategies  <cit> . information was compiled on their known expression patterns and/or gene knockout phenotypes via literature searches as referenced in table  <dig>  insufficient space exists to discuss every gene and most have been previously identified as es cell enriched transcripts. osteopontin is secreted by osteoblasts in the bone marrow niche where it is thought to play an important role in the maintenance of hsc quiescence and maintenance of 'stemness'  <cit> . it has also been discovered by other groups as a strong marker of es cells and is regulated directly by the key stem cell transcription factors, oct <dig> and sox <dig>  <cit> . thus, osteopontin is likely to be a useful marker of es cell pluripotency and may play autocrine or paracrine roles in maintenance of stemness. the second most rapidly down regulated gene was estrogen related receptor β, esrrb, which had previously been identified as a stem cell specific gene and shown to be critical for maintenance of the stem cell state  <cit> . f-box  <dig> , a member of the large f-box family of genes  <cit>  was also rapidly down regulated. fbxo <dig> is known to be highly expressed in es cells, is regulated by oct <dig> and sox <dig>  but is dispensable for es cell self-renewal  <cit> . recently, the stem cell specificity of this locus was used to screen for cdnas capable of transforming mouse fibroblasts into es cell populations  <cit> . other notable rapidly down regulated genes included the nodal inhibitors lefty- <dig> and lefty- <dig>  and zfp42/rex- <dig>  which are also well established as stem cell markers  <cit> .

oct <dig>  nanog and sox <dig> are not included in table  <dig>  even though each is required for the maintenance of es cell pluripotency  <cit>  due to their persistent expression during the first  <dig> days of eb differentiation . indeed, oct <dig> expression is known to persist beyond the inner cell mass stage of development in vivo, with transcripts detected in the epiblast and later in the primitive streak, before it becomes further restricted to primordial germ cells  <cit> .  <dig> genes with a similar pattern of expression to oct <dig>  were identified . as expected this list also includes many well known stem cell genes such as sal-like  <dig>  nodal, chromobox homolog  <dig> , dnmt3b and sprouty homolog  <dig>  <cit> . we also mined for stem cell genes by looking for similarity  with nanog and sox <dig> gene expression profiles. these provided overlapping but not identical sets of putative stem cell specific genes . full data for the  <dig> days of differentiation can be interrogated and mined for specific differentiation outcomes via signet  .

tightly co-ordinated waves of gene expression suggest sequential activation of epiblast, primitive streak and mesoderm differentiation programs
many alternative differentiation programs occur simultaneously during es cell differentiation. therefore, it is difficult to find gene syn-expression patterns that identify specific programs using standard clustering methods. an alternative approach is to search for expression patterns that closely resemble genes of known function. for example, the t box gene, brachyury, is a well characterized specific marker of the primitive streak  <cit> . brachyury expression is transient in vivo, a feature recapitulated during es cell differentiation  <cit> . using qrt-pcr, brachyury was induced ~ <dig> fold from d <dig> to day  <dig> and then rapidly silenced to baseline levels by d <dig> . the dynamics of brachyury expression were similar between serum and serum-freeb4l media , but serum-free media was unable to support brachyury induction in the absence of bmp- <dig> . thus, bmp <dig>  is essential for mesoderm generation. thirty genes were identified with a similar expression pattern to brachyury   including many genes with established expression or critical functions during primitive streak formation, such as mix <dig>  <cit> , lim <dig>  <cit> , sp <dig>  <cit>  and eomesodermin  <cit> . transient expression of many of these 'streak-specific' genes was validated by qrt-pcr . in all cases there was a close correlation between the qrt-pcr results and the profiling data .

* more than one independent illumina probe for these genes were identified

interestingly, four novel transcripts were identified in this list . one of these, 8430415e04rik, was detected by two independent probes, strongly supporting its 'streak-specific' expression; by qrt-pcr there was ~ <dig> fold induction from day  <dig> to day  <dig> of differentiation and a decrease to near baseline levels by day  <dig> . the gene contains  <dig> exons, and the full length cdna encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids  which is highly conserved in vertebrates . it has little homology to other proteins apart from three predicted heat domains or armadillo domains . drosophila armadillo interacts with β-catenin via its heat/armadillo repeat  <cit> , which suggests the protein encoded by 8430415e04rik may also be involved in protein-protein interactions.

the list of primitive streak genes in table  <dig> is smaller than that previously published  <cit>  due to the very stringent criteria used to determine brachyury-like patterns of expression. thus, to find further genes characteristic of epiblast, early and late primitive streak programs, probes were identified which were transiently up and down regulated at least two fold with peak expression at day  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> of eb differentiation. gene lists were combined  and clustered into epiblast, early, mid and late streak groups plus a unique group in which expression was very transient at day  <dig> of differentiation . also, lists were generated by searching for similarity of dynamic expression profiles to known genes which are accepted specific markers of specific stages of mouse development. for example, fgf <dig> is specifically expressed in the epiblast  <cit> , and wnt5a is expressed in the late primitive streak  <cit> . the fgf5-like  list includes the methyltransferase, dnmt3b, which was massively up-regulated in the first  <dig> days of eb differentiation  and is known to be essential for mesoderm differentiation  <cit> . this list also includes pim <dig>  zic <dig>  wnt8a, the sp <dig>  cofactor crsp <dig>  and irf <dig>  the wnt5a-like  list contains  <dig> genes including many homeobox genes , cdx <dig>  hand <dig>  tbx <dig>  bmp <dig> and the vegf receptor flt <dig> . many are expressed at e <dig> of mouse development in the remnants of the primitive streak  <cit> , suggesting the wnt5a-like list includes many genes known to pattern the embryo following formation of the germ layers. there is a significant overlap between the genes we identified as being epiblast-, early and late streak-specific and those recently identified using a similar eb differentiation system and affymetrix arrays  <cit> , and by other groups  <cit> . in addition, there are addition novel riken cdnas in these lists, which are likely to encode for interesting proteins worthy of further study .

following the primitive streak wave of gene expression there was a dramatic activation of many genes . many of the most highly induced genes, such as globin genes, heme synthesis enzymes and haematopoietic transcription factors, are known to be expressed in the blood. qrt-pcr for globin genes confirmed >  <dig>  fold induction between days  <dig> and  <dig> with a steady decline thereafter . other mesoderm and endoderm programs are also activated at this stage, so it is difficult to mine for these different outcomes.

enhanced cardiac gene expression and reduced erythropoiesis in serum-freeb4l eb culture
overall there were very strong similarities between es cell differentiation in serum and serum-free cultures supplemented with  <dig> ng/ml bmp <dig>  for example, all  <dig> of the primitive streak gene set, as defined from serum-containing cultures, were also expressed transiently and to a similar level in serum-freeb4l media . genes differentially expressed at each eb time point  were pooled and subjected to qt clustering to find sets differentially expressed between serum and serum-freeb4l eb culture. using a minimal cut-off of five genes per group, nine gene sets were identified; seven showed higher expression in serum and two showed higher expression in serum-freeb4l .

the genes in set  <dig> were expressed more highly in serum-freeb4l media from day  <dig>  and genes in set  <dig> showed up-regulation at day  <dig> and  <dig> in the absence of serum . both sets are comprised almost exclusively of cardiac-specific genes such as myosin heavy chain  <dig> , myosin light chain  <dig> , the cardiac isoform of α-actin , troponin , tropomysin , the nicotinic cholinergic receptor , and cardiac muscle fast twitch  <dig> specific atpase  . further interrogation of the array data revealed a cohort of cardiac transcription factors, including isl <dig>  mef2c, bop/smyd <dig> and hand <dig>  <cit> , which were transiently up regulated  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold in serum-freeb4l media compared to serum at day  <dig> . importantly, this elevated cardiac gene expression program correlated with increased numbers of spontaneously beating ebs in serum-freeb4l media . enhanced expression  of actc <dig>  myl <dig> and myl <dig> in serum-freeb4l media compared with serum-containing media was confirmed by qrt-pcr . taken together, this data strongly suggests cardiac muscle cell differentiation is either inhibited in serum or enhanced by the addition of bmp <dig> to serum-free culture.

the genes in set  <dig> were expressed in both serum and serum-freeb4l conditions immediately following primitive streak formation, but expressed to higher levels and slightly earlier in serum . many of these genes are globins  suggesting erythropoiesis is activated more robustly in the presence of serum . alas <dig>  a gene encoding the erythroid specific isoform of the first and rate limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway, and the erythroid specific transcription factor, p45-nf-e <dig> are also in set  <dig>  <cit> . qrt-pcr for α- and βh1-globin confirmed more rapid expression in serum versus sfb4l media , suggesting factors in addition to bmp <dig> enhance activation of the blood program from a similar primitive streak platform.

the genes in set  <dig> were expressed at a similar time in serum but expressed at very low levels or not at all in serum-freeb4l media. again, this set is highly enriched for erythroid specific genes such as alpha hemoglobin stabilising protein   <cit> , glycophorin a, erythroid kruppel-like factor   <cit>  and mitochondrial solute carrier protein   <cit>  . genes in sets  <dig> and  <dig> are activated more robustly at late time points in serum cultures. most of these are specifically expressed in macrophages. together, these results suggest delayed and less robust primitive haematopoiesis occurs in sfb4l culture compared with serum, an observation confirmed by less robust erythroid cell generation and 'redness' of the ebs from day 6– <dig> of differentiation .

rapid changes in kruppel-like factor gene expression upon es cell differentiation
three kruppel-like factor genes, klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig>  were rapidly down regulated during the first few days of eb development . all are members of the klf family of transcription factors which are characterized by a similar c-terminal domain of three c2h <dig> zinc fingers which confers binding to cacc box elements in promoters and more distant regulatory elements  <cit> . klf <dig> and klf <dig> have n-terminal transcriptional action domains and act primarily as transcriptional activators, whereas klf <dig> is best known as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . until recently, klf <dig> and klf <dig> were considered to have restricted expression patterns  <cit>  with gene knockout animals showing late developmental defects in vasculogenesis and skin differentiation, respectively  <cit> . recently however, klf <dig> expression was noted in es cells  <cit> , and forced expression was shown to enhance oct <dig> expression and promote self-renewal  <cit> .

qrt-pcr confirmed the rapid down regulation of klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> in both serum and serum-freeb4l differentiation conditions, although klf <dig> expression was down regulated more slowly . klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> were all re-induced from day 3– <dig> of differentiation as mesoderm and endoderm developmental pathways are activated . sixteen of the  <dig> known klfs were examined in detail throughout the entire differentiation time course . klf <dig> was also steadily down regulated  between es cells and day  <dig> ebs in serum and serum-freeb4l media . klf <dig>  a well characterized transcriptional repressor  <cit>  via its ability to recruit the co-repressor, ctbp  <cit> , displayed an interesting biphasic expression pattern with initial rapid down regulation then re-induction from days 5– <dig> . in contrast, klf <dig> displayed little change in expression levels over the  <dig> days of eb maturation .

a. enriched in undifferentiated es cells

b. biphasic expression pattern 

klf <dig> and klf <dig> co-localize with oct <dig> in the nuclei of es cells . interestingly, all three proteins were found to preferentially reside in a nuclear sub-compartment , suggesting possible co-involvement in a protein complex or network. also, endogenous klf <dig> was detected by specific cacc box dna-binding activity in undifferentiated es cells, which was lost upon eb differentiation . in contrast, endogenous es cell klf <dig> dna binding activity was not detected using the p18ink4c promoter cacc box sequence, although recombinant klf <dig> was shown to bind to this probe . sp <dig> and sp <dig> are ubiquitously expressed cacc-box binding proteins, which are dominant in es cell nuclear extracts . we hypothesize klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> compete with sp <dig> family members for dna binding to key cis elements in various stem cell genes to regulate expression in positive and negative fashions .

enrichment of klf-binding cis elements in the proximal promoters of stem cell specific genes
to investigate whether kruppel-like factors might directly regulate stem cell gene expression, and therefore play a role in the maintenance or loss of 'stemness', the presence of klf transcription factor binding sites  within the proximal promoters of all genes in table  <dig> was determined. although a position weighted matrix  for klf <dig> binding site specificity has been published  <cit> , this site does not resemble the cacc box sequences known to bind other klfs. since klf <dig> has identical dna-binding residues in each of its three c-terminal c2h <dig> zinc fingers to other members of the kruppel-like factor family  <cit> , it should bind to similar sequences. based on the crystal structure of the zinc fingers of zif <dig> and sp <dig> bound to dna  <cit> , and testing of specific binding of cacc box variants to recombinant klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig>  <cit> , a generic klf tfbs has been proposed. although a selex experiment for klf <dig> binding has not been published, experiments from our group suggest a c at position  <dig>  an a or c at position  <dig>  an a at position  <dig>  and an a, t or c at position  <dig> of the  <dig> bp consensus provides enhanced affinity for klf <dig> binding. taken together, these studies have enabled the development of a pwm  that should predict klf <dig>  klf <dig> and other klf tfbss .

clover  <cit>  was used to determine if defined tfbss were statistically over-represented in the stem cell lists. we searched for pwms for klf-a, klf <dig>  <cit> , octamer, extended octamer, nanog, and oct-sox binary sites as well as negative control sites  in sequences  <dig> kb upstream of the tsss of stem cell genes , versus  <dig> kb of sequences upstream of the entire murine transcriptome . there was significant over-representation of klf-a tfbs within the first  <dig> kb of promoter sequences from the stem list gene list  , as well as over-representation of octamer sites and extended oct4-binding sites as defined from chip-pet data  <cit> . no statistically significant over-representation of klf <dig>  <cit> , nanog, gata <dig> or e-box tfbss were identified. all genes in the rapidly down regulated gene list have at least one klf-a type cacc site, or octamer or oct <dig>  <cit>  tfbs. a full list of the promoters with highlighted sites is available on request. together, this data strongly suggests direct transcriptional regulation of many stem cell genes by klfs.

the zfp42/rex <dig> gene promoter is presented as an example of output from the clover program . it contains five klf-a, one octamer and three oct <dig> tfbs. the two cacc box elements within the first  <dig> base pairs of the tss represent classical extended klf-binding sites  <cit> . these regions are the same as previously reported  <cit>  although their functional importance has not been determined. interestingly, two of the three klf-a tfbs were evolutionarily conserved between the mouse and rat gene promoters . also, two further conserved cacc sites at - <dig>  and - <dig>  kb were identified within  <dig> bp of extended evolutionary conservation  . this might act as a klf dependent enhancer. most of the stem cell genes in list  <dig> have conserved cacc box elements in their promoters  <cit> . in some cases these have been reported to bind the ubiquitous sp <dig>  but our clover analysis suggests they are also likely to bind klfs .

discussion
expression profiling of murine es cell differentiation was undertaken over a 16-day time course. we compared gene expression in methylcellulose cultures containing serum versus chemically defined media containing lif  and low concentrations of bmp <dig>   <cit> . the illumina® sentrix mouse  <dig> bead array provided a sensitive and detailed platform for analysis of dynamic gene expression. using various data mining approaches, lists of stem cell-enriched genes and genes that are induced during the in vitro equivalent of epiblast and primitive streak stages of differentiation were generated. in combination with other es cell profiling studies  <cit> , our detailed expression data provides a useful resource for future reverse genetic approaches  to study the function of these genes during es cell differentiation and in vivo development. we also found a number of previously uncharacterized cdnas  which could play important roles during development.

importantly, the loss of pluripotency, measured by oct <dig> gene expression, was comparable between serum and serum-freeb4l eb culture, following a predicted decrease over the first  <dig> days. surprisingly, oct <dig> gene expression gradually increased following day  <dig>  an observation independent of the cell lines used . it remains undetermined if expansion of oct <dig> positive es cells persists as undifferentiated populations within our eb culture system. previous studies have identified the development of oct <dig> positive primordial germ cells  following  <dig> days of es cell differentiation  <cit> , suggesting the oct <dig> profile may alternatively represent the expansion of non-es cell populations. although the expansion of some undifferentiated es cells is possible, the array profile does not suggest global persistence or up-regulation of es gene expression late in the eb program. also, markers of mesoderm induction such as brachyury and mixl, do not show persistent up-regulation following peak expression at day  <dig>  suggesting ebs are unlikely to harbour cells which are delayed or arrested from entering the differentiation program.

we found significant differences in cardiac gene expression during eb differentiation in serum and serum-freeb4l culture. our current understanding of cardiac development provides possible insights into this observation. briefly, in vivo studies have revealed bmps secreted from the anterior lateral plate, and ill-defined signals from anterior primitive endoderm, are key inducers of cardiac development  <cit> . the administration of recombinant bmp <dig> or bmp <dig> to chick explant cultures induces cardiac differentiation in non-cardiogenic mesoderm  <cit>  and bmp <dig> knockout animals develop cardiac abnormalities  <cit> . conversely, wnts secreted by the neural tube are strong suppressors of cardiogenesis. together, these opposing signals act to establish the borders of the heart field  <cit> . by mimicking the environment that establishes cardiogenesis in vivo, assays capable of directing cardiomyocyte production from es cells have been established. bmps can efficiently enhance the cardiac program when added to eb culture  <cit> , whereas bmp inhibition drastically suppresses this outcome. in our hands cultures supplemented with bmp <dig>  supported cardiomyocyte maturation  with greatest expression detected at day 8– <dig>  this correlated with increased numbers of spontaneously beating ebs, and the timing of initial spontaneous contractions during murine embryogenesis  <cit> . the cardiac program was significantly reduced in culture containing 10% serum, an observation supported by a number of other studies  <cit> . this suggests the constituents of serum are inhibitory to cardiomyocyte development. although a detailed assessment of cardiomyocyte differentiation was not the focus of this analysis, the array output, qrt-pcr profiles and morphological observations described supports the usefulness of this assay in future investigations. in addition, the defined constituents of serum-freeb4l media provides an excellent opportunity to identify additional recombinant factors required to further expand cardiac progenitor cell production from ebs.

in contrast, the hematopoietic program was more pronounced within ebs grown in 10% serum than bmp <dig> alone . in particular, eklf  expression was significantly reduced in serum-free media supplemented with bmp <dig>  compared with serum . eklf is essential for regulation of a large cohort of erythroid specific genes  <cit> , many of which were identified in sets  <dig> and  <dig> . thus, it is likely that reduced eklf expression in sfb4l media directly results in inhibition of a cascade of erythroid gene expression. previous work showed the addition of bmp  to serum-free es cell culture induces eklf expression and restores hematopoietic cell differentiation  <cit> . although a weak hematopoietic program was observed in sfb4l culture, the concentration of bmp <dig> used was less than that used by adelman et al. thus, we suggest a robust cardiac  gene expression program is induced by low conentrations of bmp <dig> , whereas a robust blood gene expression program  requires > <dig> ng/ml of bmp <dig> or additional growth factors. recently, mesoderm derived progenitor cell populations for hematopoietic and cardiac lineages were studied during eb development using es cells in which gfp is targeted to the brachyury locus  <cit> . within day  <dig>  ebs, gfp+flk1+ cells were shown to represent hematopoietic precursors, whereas gfp+flk1- cells were significantly enriched for cardiac progenitor populations. it would be interesting to determine if the ratio of flk1+/flk1- within the brachyury positive population is altered between our two culture conditions.

a number of the kruppel-like factor family of transcription factors were dynamically expressed in the first few days of es cell differentiation. it was initially surprising to find highly enriched klf <dig> and klf <dig> expression in es cells, since both are considered markers of terminally differentiated cell types such as skin  <cit> , gut  <cit> , vascular smooth muscle  <cit>  and lymphocytes  <cit> . however, recent evidence suggests klfs may regulate stem cell function, since klf <dig> is enriched in es cells  <cit>  and forced over-expression within these cells can maintain pluripotency in the absence of lif  <cit> . furthermore, klf <dig> can bind the lefty <dig> gene core promoter co-operatively with oct <dig> and sox <dig>  <cit> . although lefty  <dig> and  <dig> are best characterized as repressors of nodal, acting to regulate left-right patterning  <cit> , our results and those of others, suggest a possible redundant role for lefty proteins during the maintenance of es cell pluripotency  <cit> . similarly to the oct <dig> expression profile, many of the klf family members also increased in expression late in the differentiation program. as mentioned, the klfs are expressed in diverse tissues during development. it is therefore expected that the profiles obtained reflect the generation and early specification of mesoderm and endoderm cells following primitive streak gene activation at day  <dig> 

based on the likely identical binding specificity of the klf family, established transcriptional activation and repression roles of certain family members  <cit> , and bioinformatic evidence of a high prevalence of klf tfbss in many stem cell genes, we propose klf competition for occupancy of these cacc box elements might determine self-renewal versus differentiation of es cells. according to this model, high levels of klf <dig> and klf <dig> expression in undifferentiated es cells would lead to occupancy of cacc box elements in promoters of stem cell genes such as pou5f1/oct <dig>  nanog, esrrb, zfp42/rex <dig>  lefty <dig> and lefty <dig>  furthermore, the klf <dig> and klf <dig> genes themselves have cacc box elements in their proximal promoters , suggesting a positive feedback loop within es cells is likely. interestingly, gene knockout and lentiviral shrna gene knockdown of klf <dig> or klf <dig>  does not lead to an obvious stem cell defect  <cit> , suggesting these two klfs may have functionally redundant roles during the maintenance of pluripotency. future analysis of klf2/klf <dig> double knockout es lines or the knockdown of both proteins using rnai technologies will be necessary to validate this hypothesis. upon es cell differentiation, down regulation of klf <dig> and klf <dig> was very rapid, whereas down regulation of oct <dig> and nanog was delayed for one to two days. we suggest loss of klf <dig> and klf <dig> binding to pouf1/oct <dig>  nanog, esrrb and perhaps other stem cell promoters, could be directly responsible for their down regulation. moreover, klf <dig> was down regulated more slowly, and klf <dig> was up-regulated in the first two days of differentiation, suggesting these klfs may function primarily as transcriptional repressors at the pouf1/oct <dig>  nanog, zfp <dig> and esrrb gene promoters. once this differentiation driving transcription network is activated we suggest klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> can accelerate loss of the stem cell state by directly repressing expression of the klf <dig> and klf <dig> genes themselves. therefore, a combination of cross regulation of transcriptional outputs, and competition for occupancy of key stem cell promoters by klf proteins with differing biochemical properties but identical dna-binding capacities, may determine self-renewal versus differentiation outcomes. again validation of this model requires functional analysis. it is important to note we have not proven occupancy of stem cell gene promoters by the klfs in vivo. chromatin immuno-precipitation  experiments in es cells and differentiated populations are essential to validate this model, however chip grade antibodies are not currently available.

this scenario is not necessarily limited to es cell differentiation. a similar program may take place in many adult stem and progenitor cells populations. certainly competition between klf <dig> and klf <dig> has been suggested to regulate cell growth  <cit> , and klf <dig> and klf <dig> compete for binding and have opposing effects in blood cells  <cit> . furthermore, an imbalance between occupancy of key stem cell or proliferation gene promoters by klfs, with differing activating and repressing functions, could be responsible for the development or progression of many common forms of cancer. for example, loss of hetero-zygosity for klf <dig> and klf <dig> has been found in colon, stomach, breast, prostate and liver cancers  <cit> .

in addition to the proposed complex transcriptional interplay between klfs and stem cell gene promoters, direct protein-protein interactions and protein networks involving klfs are possible. we showed sub-nuclear localization of klf <dig> and klf <dig> with oct <dig> in es cells , and klf <dig> can co-operate with oct <dig> and sox <dig> to drive expression of the lefty <dig> core promoter  <cit> . also, very recent biochemical purification of nanog-interacting proteins discovered klf <dig> as part of a nanog-oct <dig> network in es cells . this is also consistent with the ability of klf <dig> to co-operate with oct <dig>  sox <dig> and c-myc to drive de-differentiation of fibroblasts into es-like cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
defining the genetic regulation of es cell self renewal and differentiation will be instrumental for the development of future cell based therapies. using  <dig> k illumina® sentrix bead arrays, the differential expression of genes during  <dig> days of es cell differentiation was determined. hierarchical gene clustering and correlation statistical analyses lead to the identification of a small cohort of genes which define the stem cell state. historically, es cell differentiation is achieved in culture media containing 10–15% fbs. a direct comparison between es cell differentiation in serum and a serum-free media was undertaken. surprisingly, global gene expression profiles were comparable between culture conditions, with the exception of mesoderm derived cardiac and haematopoietic transcripts. these results support the use of defined serum-free approaches for the directed differentiation of es cell commitment. expression of many klf family members were enriched in es cells and rapidly down regulated upon differentiation. klf <dig> and klf <dig> were co-localisation with oct <dig> in es cell nuclei and klf transcription factor binding sites were over-represented within the promoters of the putative es cell gene list . taken together, this data strongly suggests klf family members regulate the maintenance of es cell pluripotency.
