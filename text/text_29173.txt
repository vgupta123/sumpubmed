BACKGROUND
because of the lack of extensive glaciations there during the quaternary  <cit> , the warm temperate climate zones of east asia are considered to be one of the most important areas for the long-term persistence of arcto-tertiary forest flora  <cit> . in fact, although there are c.  <dig> genera of the arcto-tertiary relict flora endemic to east asia , their evolution has been less well elucidated  <cit> . our limited understanding of the evolution of these arcto-tertiary plants is partly attributable to the scarce vascular plant fossils in the tertiary and quaternary beds of east asia  <cit> . in addition, arcto-tertiary relict species have persisted with little morphological change  <cit> , which might mask more recent diversification events. finally, the modern patterns of endemism and disjunction of these relicts  provide only limited insight into how past changes in climate, tectonics, and/or sea-level influenced their range dynamics and population/species divergence .

nonetheless, recent molecular phylogeographic studies suggest that most arcto-tertiary relicts endemic to china have been little affected by quaternary glacial-interglacial alternation  <cit> . in those instances, species likely tracked their climatic niche boundaries locally through altitudinal migration in a topographically complex landscape . as a possible exception, the chinese-japanese disjunct cercidiphyllum japonicum responded to quaternary climate change through latitudinal range shifts, in both regions, which likely reflects the species’ high pollen/seed dispersal capacity, sprouting ability, and/or climatic  tolerance  <cit> . hence, these different responses may be largely explained by taxon-specific differences in migratory capacity and/or eco-climatic niche preferences  <cit> . however, additional studies are needed to gain a better understanding of when arcto-tertiary relict plants in east asia diversified and whether and how they have responded to late neogene/quaternary environmental change in the extent and connectivity of their habitats.

euptelea sieb. et zucc., is the only genus in eupteleaceae, comprising two extant species, e. pleiosperma hook. f. et thoms. and e. polyandra sieb. et zucc.  <cit>  . both are diploid   <cit> , small- to medium-sized, broad-leaved deciduous trees with bisexual and wind-pollinated flowers that turn into winged fruitlets , dispersed by gravity, wind and/or water  <cit> . e. pleiosperma has its main centre of distribution in regions bordering the eastern margin of the qinghai-tibetan plateau /hengduan mts. and southwest china , with scattered occurrences in central/east china and northeast india/assam; its populations are distributed in isolated stands across a wide range of altitudes  in mountain riparian warm-temperate deciduous  forest  <cit> . by contrast, e. polyandra is restricted to the riparian wtd forest of south-central japan   .

euptelea has extensive fossil records throughout the northern hemisphere, extending to at least the palaeocene . in east asia, euptelea-like fossils have been reported from the mid-miocene of southeast china  <cit>  and from the pliocene to the mid-pleistocene of central japan  <cit>  . although e. polyandra had initially been classed as a member of trochodendraceae  <cit> , smith  <cit>  incorporated this species into the unigeneric family eupteleaceae, consisting of only e. pleiosperma at that time. previous phylogenetic analyses  <cit>  supported e. pleiosperma and e. polyandra as separate species, but only two samples from each species were included. moreover, euptelea is part of the earliest-diverging lineage of ranunculales , which, in turn, appear at the base of eudicots . however, no information is available on the divergence times between and within the two species, to say nothing about their genetic architecture, demographic history, and ecological  niche divergence. notably, this latter aspect has rarely been examined in phylogeographic studies of east asia’s temperate flora in general, and its tertiary relict components in particular  <cit> .

here, we use an integrative approach by combining phylogeographic and fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analyses with climatic data and niche identity tests to clarify the time and mode of lineage divergence and historical demography of euptelea. our specific aims were to  reveal the genetic relationships of the two extant species , and approximate divergence times of interspecific and intraspecific lineages;  determine climatic niche divergence of both species and the two major lineages identified in e. pleiosperma; and  illustrate the genetic diversity and population demographic patterns of both species.

methods
population sampling
leaf material was obtained from  <dig> populations  of e. pleiosperma and  <dig> populations  of e. polyandra , covering most of the geographical range of the genus in east asia except northeast india/assam  <cit> . fresh leaves were collected from each individual and dried with silica gel.

dna isolation, sequencing and microsatellite genotyping
total genomic dna was extracted from the silica-dried leaf tissue using dna plantzol  following the manufacturer’s protocol. for the phylogeographic dna surveys, two intergenic spacer  regions  and the rpl <dig> intron of chloroplast  dna, revealing high levels of variation in a preliminary screen, and the entire internal transcribed spacer  region of nuclear ribosomal  dna were selected for sequencing. subsets of the samples were sequenced at cpdna regions  and its region . a subset of individuals was also sequenced at three additional cpdna regions  for phylogenetic analysis . the primers and methodology for pcr amplification of these cpdna and its regions were described elsewhere . the pcr products were directly sequenced in both directions with an abi 3730xl dna analyzer . the raw sequence data were adjusted, assembled and aligned in geneious v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . all cpdna and its haplotype sequences have been deposited in genbank .

following zhang et al.  <cit>  and wu et al.  <cit> , eight nssr markers  and amplification protocols, specially developed for euptelea, were used for genotyping all samples . the pcr products were also loaded on an abi 3730xl dna analyzer, and the data were scored and compiled using genemarker v. <dig> . <dig> .

phylogeographic analyses of cpdna, its, and nssrs
for both cpdna and its, all indels and inversions were treated as single mutation events, and coded as substitutions with equal weight  <cit> . haplotype  and nucleotide  diversities  <cit>  were calculated for each population  and species  using dnasp v. <dig>   <cit> . tcs v. <dig>   <cit>  was used to estimate an unrooted network of euptelea haplotypes that illustrates all linkages with a > 95 % probability of being most parsimonious. analysis of molecular variance  in arlequin v. <dig>   <cit>  was performed using Φ-statistics to quantify the composition of total genetic  variance, with significance of fixation indices tested using  <dig>  permutations  <cit> . population differentiation for ordered  and unordered  haplotypes  were obtained with permut  <cit>  to test whether nst is significantly larger than gst , indicating the presence of phylogeographic structure.

for the nssr dataset, one e. pleiosperma and two e. polyandra populations with small sample sizes  were removed from all population-level analyses of genetic diversity and differentiation, limiting those analyses to  <dig> populations . all eight loci were checked for frequencies of null alleles using the expectation maximization  algorithm  <cit>  implemented in freena  <cit> . we measured unbiased genetic diversity  <cit>  across all loci for all populations with n ≥  <dig>  and calculated their allelic  and private allelic  richness  in hp-rare v. <dig>   <cit> . fstat v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to estimate the total number of detected alleles , gene diversity , and genetic differentiation   <cit>  between populations  per-locus and overall.

bayesian clustering of individuals was performed in structure v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  for the entire nssr dataset  and each species. we used the admixture model without prior information on population membership, and assumed independent allele frequencies among populations. the number of clusters  was set to vary depending on the data set. for each value of k, we conducted  <dig> independent simulations with both a burn-in and run length of  <dig>  markov chain monte carlo  replications. the number of gene pools  was inferred by estimating lnp  <cit>  and Δk  <cit> . amovas were carried out in arlequin with r-statistics as described above.

phylogenetic divergence time estimation and demographic inference
to relate the diversification of major cpdna lineages of euptelea to neogene events, we adopted a two-step approach for estimating divergence times in beast v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  by taking advantage of calibration points used in previous studies of ranunculales . taxon sampling has been shown to affect dates among basal eudicots; increased taxon sampling, particularly in underrepresented clades, will likely improve the accuracy of divergence time estimation  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> ranunculales species, including  <dig> species of ranunculaceae,  <dig> of berberidaceae and  <dig> of menispermaceae , and the two species of eupteleaceae , plus representatives of sabiaceae  and proteales  of basal eudicots used as outgroups   <cit> , were selected for estimating the crown group age of euptelea. these selected species thus represent all major lineages of ranunculales based on more broadly sampled earlier phylogenetic studies  <cit> . first, we retrieved sequences of two cpdna regions  and 26s nrdna from genbank for the  <dig> ranunculales species. sequences were assembled together and then bayesian searches for tree topologies and node ages of this cpdna + 26s nrdna dataset were implemented in beast with a gtr + g + i substitution model selected by jmodeltest v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock  <cit> . a yule process was chosen as tree prior. four calibration points were used to determine minimum age constraints on specific node priors . the first calibration point is based on the oldest confirmed fruit fossil of sabiaceae from the cretaceous in czech republic  <cit> , which is unambiguously assigned to insitiocarpus moravicus. following anderson et al.  <cit> , we assigned this fruit fossil to the stem of sabiaceae . the flower fossil of platanocarpus brookensis from the mid-cretaceous in north america  <cit>  was taken as the second calibration point and was used to calibrate the crown age of nelumbo and platanus   <cit> . following anderson et al.  <cit> , we used the endocarp fossil of prototinomiscium  from the cretaceous of central europe  <cit>  to calibrate the crown age of the menispermeaceae-berberidaceae-ranunculaceae clade . finally, following wang et al.  <cit> , we used a leaf fossil of mahonia from the mid-eocene in north america  <cit>  to calibrate the crown age of the ranzania-mahonia-berberis clade . all calibration points were modeled using a lognormal prior with a zero offset  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 45 ma, respectively; by default, lognormal mean of  <dig> and lognormal sd of  <dig>  were used to constrain each node . to evaluate the robustness of the resulting age estimates, we removed each calibration sequentially while holding the rest three calibrations  <cit> .

in a second step, we applied a similar beast analysis to all  <dig> cpdna  haplotype sequences of euptelea identified in the phylogeographic survey  to determine intrageneric node ages, with platanus occidentalis used as outgroup . we employed the same settings as in the first step, but for a gtr + g substitution model and a constant-size coalescent tree prior. to calibrate the root node , we used the median crown age of euptelea  estimated from the ranunculales phylogeny  with a normal distribution . for both beast analyses, mcmc runs were conducted, each of 2 ×  <dig> generations, with trees sampled every  <dig> generations, after the initial 10 % were discarded as burn-in. the mcmc samples were examined in tracer v. <dig>   <cit>  to confirm sampling adequacy and convergence of the chains to a stationary distribution.fig.  <dig>

for each species, and major  phylogroups , we constructed bayesian skyline plots  in beast to date changes in effective population size  over time  <cit> . we assumed an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock with substitution rates obtained from the intrageneric beast analyses described earlier. the mcmcs were run for 1 ×  <dig> generations with trees sampled every  <dig> generations, following a burn-in of the initial 10 % cycles. three replicate runs were performed to confirm convergence.

ecological niche modelling and niche identity tests
enms were generated using the maximum entropy method implemented in maxent v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to predict the potentially suitable climate envelopes for each euptelea species in the present, and in two past periods: the last glacial maximum , c.  <dig> kya; and the last interglacial , c.  <dig> kya. information on the geographic distribution of euptelea was based on a total of  <dig> presence records, including  <dig> for e. pleiosperma  and  <dig> for e. polyandra , with the removal of duplicate records within each pixel . we compiled  <dig> environmental variables for each period from the worldclim database with a resolution of  <dig>  arc minutes  <cit>  for each environment layer . based on  <dig> records for e. pleiosperma and  <dig> records for e. polyandra, a current distribution model was developed for each species using five bioclimatic data layers  at  <dig>  arc-minutes resolution for the present . this limited bioclimatic dataset avoided containing highly correlated variables , and therefore prevented potential overfitting  <cit> . by adopting default settings with  <dig> replicates, we used 75 % of species records to train the model and 25 % to test the model. the area under the roc curve  was calculated for each run to assess the model accuracy. values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicate good discrimination  <cit> . we then projected the established model onto the reconstructed climatic conditions for the lgm and lig periods, as simulated by the community climate system model v. <dig>   <cit> , provided by the palaeoclimate modelling intercomparison project . following sakaguchi et al.  <cit> , the present-day and lgm palaeoclimate layers were prepared in  <dig>  arc-minutes resolution. to account for changes in palaeo-coastlines in the east china sea  region during the lgm   <cit> , we used the seafloor topography data  from the national geophysical data center of national oceanic and atmospheric administration .

to examine potential environmental factors associated with the divergence between e. pleiosperma and e. polyandra , the means and standard errors of those  <dig> bioclimatic variables were then calculated for each species  and compared to detect significant differences using two-tailed t-tests in r v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we also performed niche identity tests  <cit>  in enmtools v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with  <dig> pseudoreplicates based on  the five bioclimatic variables used for enm ; and  all the  <dig> bioclim variables together, for testing the null hypothesis that the two species  are occupying identical climatic environments . to this aim, we compared their actual niches to a distribution of niche similarities obtained from pairs of pseudoniches based on randomly sampled occurrence points  <cit> . niche overlap was quantified by both schoener’s d  <cit>  and the standardized hellinger distance .

RESULTS
cpdna phylogeography and diversity
the total alignment of three cpdna regions sequenced across the  <dig> individuals of euptelea was 2078 bp in length, including  <dig> single-nucleotide variable sites, five indels , and one inversion . together, these  <dig> polymorphisms identified  <dig> haplotypes , of which  <dig> were specific to e. pleiosperma  and  <dig> to e. polyandra . of the  <dig> chlorotypes identified in euptelea,  <dig> were population-specific and nearly half of the populations of each species were fixed for a single chlorotype . accordingly, non-hierarchical amova  revealed that most of the cpdna sequence variation within each species resided among populations , and this variation exhibited significant phylogeographic structure . in the tcs network , these species-specific chlorotypes formed two clades separated by thirteen mutational steps . this pronounced subdivision was also indicated by hierarchical amova with  <dig>  % among-species variation .table  <dig> the analysis of molecular variance  for cpdna data and nuclear  data for euptelea and its two species

among the  <dig> chlorotypes of e. pleiosperma, eight  were specific to a group of six populations  from the region bordering the eastern qtp/hengduan mts. . by contrast, the remaining chlorotypes were largely specific to three ‘central-eastern’ regions:  the northern and, in particular, southern flanks of the sichuan basin, including the yungui plateau ;  the mid-lower reaches of the yangtze ; and  areas north of this river . the parsimony network  grouped these chlorotypes into two lineages  and four distinct phylogroups  according to geography; the only exceptions were h <dig> and h <dig>  which resided in a single population  from the sichuan basin  region , however, were assigned to two distinct phylogroups . in e. polyandra, the two distinct phylogroups  identified segregated populations into the southern and central parts of japan .

its phylogeography and diversity
the total alignment of the its region sequenced across the  <dig> individuals of euptelea was 691 bp in length, including  <dig> single-nucleotide variable sites. these polymorphisms yielded  <dig> ribotypes , with five each specific to e. pleiosperma  and e. polyandra . the parsimony network  grouped e. pleiosperma vs e. polyandra ribotypes into distinct clades , separated by nine mutational steps, resulting in  <dig>  % among-species variation . in e. pleiosperma, the most basal ribotype  was also the most frequent and widespread one, being fixed in  <dig>  populations, while in e. polyandra almost all populations  were polymorphic. in contrast to cpdna, most of the within-species its variation resided within populations .fig.  <dig>

species subdivision and population genetic structure at nssr loci
across the  <dig> individuals of euptelea genotyped at eight nssr loci, we obtained altogether  <dig> alleles, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> alleles per locus . for the entire dataset, the Δk statistic detected a rate change in lnp corresponding to k =  <dig> . accordingly, individuals of e. pleiosperma segregated into cluster i  that was present at high frequency in western populations  but also fixed in three populations  from the southern sb region, while the rest of the central-eastern individuals were largely assigned to cluster ii. by contrast, individuals of e. polyandra almost exclusively formed a distinct cluster . a separate structure analysis of e. pleiosperma resulted in similar patterns, while for e. polyandra individuals were variously assigned to three clusters without geographical structure .fig.  <dig>

hierarchical amova  supported significant nssr variation between the two species . within each species, most of this variation resided within populations, with somewhat stronger population subdivision in e. pleiosperma  than in e. polyandra .

molecular dating and demographic analyses
the beast-derived cpdna + 26s nrdna chronogram of ranunculales  recovered euptelea as sister to core ranunculales  and estimated the crown age of euptelea as c.  <dig>  ma  . using this estimation as root prior for the cpdna chronogram of euptelea , the time to the most recent common ancestor  of all  <dig> chlorotypes was estimated as c.  <dig>  ma , suggesting a late miocene/early pliocene split between the two species. the tmrca for all chlorotypes of e. pleiosperma was estimated as c.  <dig>  ma , which in turn dates the species’ divergence into two lineages  to around the mid-pliocene. the tmrca for all chlorotypes of e. polyandra  was estimated to be only slightly younger, c.  <dig>  ma . by contrast, the coalescence times of all six phylogroups of euptelea most likely fall into the quaternary .fig.  <dig>

for e. pleiosperma, the bayesian skyline plots analysis  showed that ne kept steady growth up to the late pleistocene , followed by stable population sizes until the present, while for each of the four phylogroups,ne kept steady through time . by contrast, for e. polyandra and its two phylogroups, this analysis consistently indicated stable population sizes up until the late pleistocene , followed by a slight growth until the present .

ecological niche modelling and niche identity tests
the auc values  for the distribution modelling, averaged over  <dig> replicates, were very high , indicating a good predictive model performance. the predicted distribution of euptelea under current conditions   was similar to its actual distribution, but there were also some predicted areas where either species does not occur at present, such as northern east china and south korea  or hokkaido/north honshu of japan and central/east china . during the lig , the genus’ predicted distribution was more or less similar to that at present, but likely more favourable habitats especially for e. pleiosperma were in southwest china  and the surroundings of the sichuan basin. by contrast, at the lgm , the predicted suitable habitats of e. pleiosperma probably persisted around the latter basin, but also slightly expanded eastward, along the northern flanks of the middle-yangtze river. at the same time, the predicted suitable habitats of e. polyandra became restricted to a narrow coastal strip along the pacific ocean side of southeast japan. notably, predicted suitable habitats likely existed for e. pleiosperma in the latter region as well, and conversely, for e. polyandra in central china  and along the coasts of the exposed east china sea continental shelf; however, for each species, hospitable habitats were apparently absent on the landbridge extending from east china across south korea to south japan .fig.  <dig> potential distribution probability  of occurrence for euptelea in east asia. a at the present ; b at the last glacial maximum  and c during the last interglacial . presence records of e. pleiosperma in china  and e. polyandra in japan  are plotted as purple and dark blue points in the maps, respectively. see text for details



out of the  <dig> bioclimatic variables, all but three , showed significant differences in mean values between e. pleiosperma and e. polyandra . randomization tests of niche identity  indicated that these sister species are not ecologically equivalent  , regardless of the measure of similarity used . within e. pleiosperma, seven  bioclimatic variables showed significant  differences between the western and central-eastern cpdna lineages, i.e. in terms of isothermality , temperature/precipitation seasonality , and aspects of temperature . however, niche identity tests could not reject the null hypothesis that the two lineages occupy identical climatic niches, as d and i were non-significant  in either instance .fig.  <dig> niche identity test plots for five non-correlated  and nineteen  bioclim variables between the two species of euptelea as quantified by the standardized hellinger distance  and schoener’s d  <cit> . the vertical line in each plot represents the observed values of niche similarity  while the histograms represent those of null distributions

discussion
late neogene speciation and diversification of euptelea
our phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses based on cytoplasmic and nuclear  data  clearly support the monophyly of the genus euptelea and provide the first evidence for the genetic distinctiveness of e. pleiosperma  and e. polyandra . in addition, although these ecological differences  could reflect evolutionary divergence of both species, they might simply reflect the fact that populations of both species are largely allopatric and thus are exposed to different environmental backgrounds. hence, these species are diagnosable by geographical, morphological, molecular and ecological criteria.

based on our cpdna chronogram , this speciation event occurred c.  <dig>   ma. notably, this point estimate broadly coincides with an early stage of east china sea seafloor exposure between the eurasian mainland and the japanese/ryukyu islands   <cit> . hence, this landbridge could have allowed a common ancestor to expand its range from china to japan, followed by range fragmentation either due to an increasingly cooler and drier climate around that time in asia   <cit>  and/or a subsequent rise in sea level. of course, this vicariant scenario has to be treated with caution because of broad confidence limits around the above point estimate . nonetheless, our data clearly indicate a long period of independent evolution of the two species, which ensured almost complete lineage sorting at chloroplast and nuclear loci. in support of this, our enm for the lgm  predicted climatically suitable areas in central/east china for e. polyandra and in southeast japan for e. pleiosperma, but no such areas were predicted for either species on the ecs landbridge . therefore, the east china sea landbridge likely acted as a formidable barrier to the dispersal of euptelea species during the lgm and earlier cold periods, despite its repeated exposure during the quaternary   <cit> .

there is increasing evidence to suggest that the east china sea landbridge acted as a ‘filter’ for east asia’s temperate flora in selectively preventing or facilitating the dispersal of certain plant species  <cit> . for instance, genetic breaks across the east china sea have been observed in several understorey herbs or shrubs of wtd forest  . however, in sharp contrast, no genetic breaks associated with the east china sea were found in two widespread wtd forest tree species, namely cercidiphyllum japonicum  <cit>  and kalopanax septemlobus  <cit> . as with euptelea spp., c. japonicum is also an arcto-tertiary relict of riparian plant communities with similar reproductive characteristics   <cit> . however, c. japonicum, which is presently found up to north japan, is relatively tolerant to cold and arid climates, which might have facilitated gene exchange across the glacially exposed ecs landbridge up until its latest submergence   <cit> . by contrast, euptelea is less tolerant to cold, more drought-sensitive, and also much weaker in terms of sprouting ability  <cit> . we therefore conclude that the east china sea landbridge provided a far less suitable  environment for euptelea relative to cercidiphyllum due to taxon-specific differences in climate-related niche requirements and/or other biological  properties  <cit> .

our molecular dating analyses  indicate that the onset of diversification in e. pleiosperma  and e. polyandra  occurred at the mid-to-late pliocene. these broad hpd ranges preclude us from explaining any of these splits in terms of particular geological or palaeoclimatic events. despite these caveats, we propose that our dates are still broadly consistent with the mid-pliocene abrupt uplift of the eastern tibetan plateau and adjacent southwest china   <cit> , and the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation   <cit> . these geological and/or climatic changes had possibly acted as an isolating barrier between regional populations , and promoted the diversification of two lineages of e. pleiosperma  and two phylogroups of e. polyandra . in fact, such late neogene tectonic/climate-induced vicariance has also been invoked to explain phylogeographic splits in other tertiary-relic deciduous tree species from east asia   <cit> . however, our estimated coalescent times of the various cpdna phylogroups within e. pleiosperma  and e. polyandra  are generally more recent , implying that this haplotype diversity and structure was most likely shaped by historical processes during the  quaternary .

relative demographic stability of e. pleiosperma in china
in contrast with the profound influence of quaternary climatic fluctuations on the range dynamics of both cercidiphyllum japonicum  <cit>  and sargentodoxa cuneata  <cit>  in china, our results suggest a rather limited effect of such climate change on the demographic history and lgm distribution of e. pleiosperma in this region. this inference is based on three lines of evidence. first, e. pleiosperma exhibits strong phylogeographic structure in cpdna , which largely reflects the presence of four montane phylogroups, one in the west , and three  in the central-east . in fact, the only evident instances of inter-region seed flow pertain to the occurrence of both a western  and c <dig> chlorotype  in a single population  from the sb region ; this is probably best explained by two independent migration events from the western/mid-lower yangtze river regions, followed by the extinction of h <dig> and h <dig> in their respective source areas. second, the bsp analysis for e. pleiosperma  indicates population growth up to the late quaternary , followed by population stability until the present. finally, our enm for the lgm  suggests only slightly larger and more contiguous distributions of e. pleiosperma, particularly in areas around the sichuan basin and, to a lesser extent, along the northern flanks of the yangtze river, when compared to the lig or the present .

together, these cpdna data suggest that populations of e. pleiosperma largely persisted in their separate mountainous refugia over periods of quaternary climate change up to the present  <cit> . such population persistence might have been facilitated through periodic episodes of up-slope contraction during interglacials, and down-slope expansion during glacials, with populations tracking favourable humidity conditions as imposed by the east asian monsoon in areas of high relief  <cit> . during glacials, genetic exchange between neighboring montane lineages might have occurred through lower-elevation populations, as has been suggested for other mid- and high-elevation plant and animal taxa elsewhere . in fact, the majority of e. pleiosperma populations belonging to the three central-eastern phylogroups share the same nuclear  gene pool , excepting three from the sb region  that share gene pool i with most western populations . this pattern of nuclear cohesion, which is also reflected in the its data , is thus not entirely unexpected if we assume that inter-region gene exchange during glacials mainly occurred via pollen in low-elevation populations that were also probably the first to be extirpated during elevation shifts caused by postglacial climate warming  <cit> . however, when compared with the situation in the central-east, it also appears  that pollen less readily dispersed between the western and central-eastern phylogroups; this is most likely caused by topographical effects of the eastern qtp/hengduan mts. rather than the minor  differences in eco-climatic space found between these groups . notably, this most evident genetic break within e. pleiosperma around the sichuan basin coincides with the boundary between the sino-himalayan and sino-japanese forest subkingdoms  <cit> , and is also apparent in several other plant taxa  <cit> .

our cpdna results show that e. polyandra is comprised of two phylogroups with unique sets of chlorotypes and distinct geographic distributions, one in south japan  and the other in central japan  . given that e. polyandra is a moisture-dependent and drought-sensitive species, the deterioration of tertiary warm, moist climates during the mid-to-late pliocene  likely triggered ecological changes  <cit> , and hence drove the diversification of e. polyandra. accordingly, this phylogeographic break in central honshu, which previously has also been observed in several other biota , must have been maintained in spite of an apparently profound influence of late quaternary climate change on the species demographic history and distribution. the latter is inferred from two lines of evidence. the first is the bsp analysis, which indicates that e. polyandra  experienced long-term demographic stability before ne started to increase only relatively recently, c.  <dig>  ma . this population growth may have been triggered by climate change at the beginning of china’s ‘penultimate interglacial period’   <cit>  and the intensification of the warm, wet summer monsoon in east asia since the mid-late pleistocene   <cit> . for moisture-dependent island trees, such as e. polyandra  <cit> , this may have also led to an increase of suitable habitats throughout the warmer periods of the late quaternary. the second line of evidence comes from our enm , suggesting that, during the lgm, e. polyandra experienced a dramatic contraction of its  lig range into a narrow coastal strip along the pacific ocean side of southeast japan . notably, the single population surveyed from kyushu  harbours an phylogenetically basal chlorotype  that also predominates in south honshu, whereas its mutational derivative  is private to shikoku . it is feasible, therefore, that southeast japan  provided the source populations for postglacial colonization of these latter areas. supportive evidence for this scenario comes from the fossil pollen record, demonstrating an increase of wtd forest in south honshu/chugoku during early postglacial times  <cit> . however, in contrast to the enm results, there are two lines of genetic evidence for the glacial survival of e. polyandra in north honshu: first, this region exclusively harbours private cpdna haplotypes , and second, based on the nssrs, there is no decreasing trend of genetic diversity  compared with areas further south , as would be expected under a leading edge model of northward colonization  <cit> . rather, these data suggest that extant populations in north honshu are derived from a cryptic glacial refuge that occurred within local favourable microclimates  <cit> , but which cannot be detected by enm-based palaeodistribution reconstructions  <cit> . evidently, both nuclear markers  failed to detect this refuge, and hence the south-central divide of e. polyandra in cpdna . it appears unlikely that this discordance reflects incomplete nuclear lineage sorting, given the timeframe of the phylogroup divergence. rather, a more tenable explanation is that the species’ range-wide nuclear cohesion results from periodic secondary contact and admixture via pollen during inter-/postglacials.

CONCLUSIONS
the speciation and lineage diversification events of euptelea reflect the primary influence of successive climate/tectonic-induced vicariance during the late miocene and pliocene periods. by contrast, the haplotype diversity and structure at the within-group level of each euptelea species are most likely shaped by the climatic cycles of the  quaternary. during this time, e. pleiosperma populations seem to have been mostly stationary within their multiple mountain refugia, whereby topographical constraints to seed/pollen dispersal fostered the divergence among ‘western’ and ‘central-eastern’ cpdna phylogroups. contemporaneously, e. polyandra populations in south japan apparently underwent repeated range contractions/expansions, while those in central japan may have persisted in a cryptic glacial refuge in north honshu. overall, our results  illustrate how late neogene climatic changes promoted speciation and lineage diversification in east asia’s tertiary relict flora; and  demonstrate for the first time a greater variation in such species’ responses to glacial cycles in japan when compared to congeners in china. overall, this study should contribute to a better understanding of the potential historical  processes that may have generally impacted the east asia’s arcto-tertiary flora.
