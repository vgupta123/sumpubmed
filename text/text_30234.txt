BACKGROUND
while desertification is expected to increase as a result of global climate change and anthropogenic influence, understanding the genomic basis of evolutionary responses to these environmental changes and associated challenges at the organismal level, such as desiccation, is imperative. organisms are capable of surprisingly rapid adaptations to environmental challenges, such as the application of pesticides  <cit>  or antibiotics  <cit> , suggesting an ample supply of adaptive genetic variation and pervasive impact of positive directional selection. as the environment changes, alleles that previously segregated neutrally, or were only weakly influenced by selection, may become targets of strong selection, in addition to newly arising adaptive mutations. yet, the precise mode by which beneficial mutations contribute to adaptation remains largely unclear  <cit> .

recent studies show that adaptations frequently result from ‘soft’ selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population in parallel, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations  <cit> . alternatively, selective sweeps can be ‘hard’, where a novel beneficial allele arises after the onset of selection and sweeps through the population  <cit> . whether adaptation originates through hard or soft sweeps depends mostly on the availability of beneficial mutations  <cit> , with hard sweeps taking place when beneficial alleles are absent at the onset of selection and when the waiting time for adaptive mutations to arise is long  <cit> . conversely, soft sweeps are more likely to occur when the waiting time until an adaptive mutation arises is shorter than the time it takes for this mutation to spread through the population. in a hard selective sweep, all adaptive alleles coalesce into a single mutation  <cit> , leaving characteristic footprints on neighboring genomic regions, such as a reduction in genetic diversity surrounding the adaptive site  <cit> , a distinct long haplotype  <cit> , and an excess of high-frequency derived alleles and singletons  <cit> . by contrast, soft sweep footprints are less pronounced and therefore more difficult to discern from surrounding neutral polymorphism, since lineages coalesce into two or more alleles, and adaptive loci may remain moderately diverse in the population  <cit> .

a number of approaches have been developed to detect selective sweeps in population genetic data, using a combination of methods based on ld or haplotype structure  <cit> , background allele frequency spectrum from pool-seq data  <cit> , as well as the interplay between recombination and ancestral variation  <cit> . haplotype data can also be used to distinguish between signatures of soft and hard sweeps  <cit> . however, these two might not be easily separable, particularly when hard sweeps are incomplete or when recombination in distant regions linked to hard sweep sites creates patterns of polymorphism that closely mirrors what is expected to be found near soft sweeps, the so-called soft-shoulder effect  <cit> . these spurious soft sweeps may appear as far as kilobases or even megabases away from the true selected target under moderately strong selection  <cit> .

experimental evolution uses well-defined selection protocols to force phenotypic divergence, which combined with genome-wide scans  may narrow down the candidate target regions under positive selection . experimental evolution provides a unique advantage compared to other evolutionary approaches: the ability to replicate an experiment under identical conditions, and thus to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic effects. this replication provides immediate clues about genetic parallelism that can be used to separate soft sweeps from hard sweeps, since sweep signatures parallel between replicates under the same selection pressure, either due to shared standing genetic variation or recurrent mutations, will by definition rule out hard sweeps . parallel genetic changes have been observed in experimental evolution experiments with escherichia coli , yeast  <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , and drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . while genetic parallelism in the first two systems was due to recurrent mutations, standing genetic variation shared between experimental replicates is the most likely explanation for evolutionary convergence in such organisms as drosophila.

drosophila provide an exceptional model to study the ability to survive droughts, which pose a dramatic ecological and physiological challenge to most organisms inhabiting desert and mesic environments  <cit> . xeric-adapted drosophila species are characterized by relatively high desiccation resistance  <cit> , lower water loss rates  <cit> , and decreased metabolic rates under dry conditions  <cit> . artificial selection for increased desiccation resistance in d. melanogaster leads to critical metabolic alterations, including augmented accumulation of glycogen and differential metabolism of carbohydrates  <cit> . at the transcriptional level, desiccation stress in drosophila mojavensis alters genes associated with metabolic regulation and carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> , including cuticular hydrocarbons  <cit> .

in this study we assessed changes in d. melanogaster genomes, with the focus on signatures of positive selection, associated with laboratory selection for increased desiccation resistance over  <dig> generations . this experimental evolution system resulted in strong adaptive responses leading to increased desiccation resistance and changes in recombination frequencies  <cit> . here we show that the selected lines also underwent extensive changes at the genomic level, with a high degree of positive selection-driven sequence divergence and zero or near-zero heterozygosity across numerous sites, producing patterns consistent with selective sweeps.fig.  <dig> experimental setup of the experimental evolution experiment for increased desiccation resistance in drosophila melanogaster




RESULTS
polymorphism scanning
three desiccation lines after long-term selection and three parallel control lines  were illumina-sequenced using pooled genomes per line . we found a total of  <dig> , <dig> polymorphic sites,  <dig>  of which were fixed in all control lines and  <dig>  were fixed in all desiccation lines. a total of  <dig> , or  <dig>  % of the  <dig> , <dig>  variants were shared with the drosophila genetic reference panel lines . among the fixed sites in desiccation lines,  <dig>   were in coding regions, compared to  <dig>   fixed sites in coding regions of control lines . a total of  <dig>  polymorphic sites were experiment-specific, i.e. one allele fixed in all control lines and an alternative allele fixed in all desiccation lines . these snps include  <dig> fixed non-synonymous sites within coding sequences, significantly enriched  for functions related to response to copper ion , nuclear chromosome part , and proteolysis  . we found  <dig> non-synonymous sites with the same allele fixed in all control lines and two out of the three desiccation lines but with an alternative allele fixed in the remaining desiccation line, a pattern consistent with hard selective sweeps. examples of these non-synonymous fixed changes occurring in only one desiccation line include chr3l:6319299g > c in olfactory receptor gene or65b, with one of the selection lines, ak2- <dig>  having allele “g” while all other five lines containing “c”, which results in amino acid change from leu to phe. other genes affected by such snps include ubp64e, scny, qc, mdr <dig>  ndl, cpr72ec, and abd-a . these snps tend to be clustered across two islands on chromosome arm 3 l , suggesting effects of selection.table  <dig> distribution of snps



positive selection signatures
we used pool-hmm based on a hidden markov model  to detect possible selective sweep regions  <cit> . we found  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> selective sweep regions in selection/desiccation lines ak2_ <dig>  ak2_ <dig>  and ak2_ <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> regions were shared among all three of them. by comparison, there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> putative selective sweep regions in control lines ak2_ <dig>  ak2_ <dig>  and ak2_ <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> regions were shared among all three of them. even though the sheer number of putative sweep regions was similar between the desiccation group and the control group , the total length of shared sweep regions among the lines in the desiccation group was  <dig>  times longer than the length of shared regions in the control group , and the mean length in the desiccation group was significantly greater than that in the control group . lower nucleotide diversity is expected within selective sweep regions. to test this prediction, we calculated heterozygosity in 100 kb windows with a step of 10 kb. the overall heterozygosity in the desiccation group was indeed lower compared to heterozygosity of the control group  for autosomes in desiccation and control group, respectively;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for x chromosome in desiccation and control group, respectively). the average heterozygosity in shared sweep regions in the desiccation group was  <dig> . these results are consistent with a strong selection pressure in the desiccation group, and the lower heterozygosity in x chromosome likely reflects the difference in effective population sizes between x chromosome and autosomes. simulations of neutral evolution under conditions similar to our experimental setup, based on genomic variation of dgrp <dig>  failed to produce regions of decreased heterozygosity comparable with experimental ones . simulated drift effects were also unable to drive the same allele to fixation in three lines while the alternative allele was fixed in the other three lines . when selection was added to the simulations, we were able to generate large genomic regions  of depleted heterozygosity comparable to observed sweep regions, but only when the selected allele was initially present at a very low frequency  and assigned high relative fitness  .fig.  <dig> sweeps found in the desiccation group and the control group. average length of sweep regions  and length of shared sweep regions  for desiccation and control groups by chromosomes



we found blocks of extremely low heterozygosity overlapping with the hmm-identified sweep regions in the desiccation group . mean heterozygosity values in non-sweep regions and sweep regions for control lines were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for selection lines, respectively. as expected, the reduction in heterozygosity between sweep regions and non-sweep regions was thus stronger in selection lines . tajima’s d and π values produced a very similar pattern to heterozygosity along the sweep regions . accordingly, sweep signatures shared by all lines in the desiccation group likely represent soft sweeps, since the parallelism is most easily explained by preexisting variation at a sufficiently high population frequency to not be stochastically lost by drift. we found a total of  <dig> putative soft sweep regions . go enrichment analysis of genes involved in the shared sweep regions in the desiccation group shows functional enrichments for organophosphate ester transmembrane transporter activity, electron carrier activity, water channel activity, and proteolysis . on the other hand, line-specific sweep signatures  that are not adjacent to other shared sweep regions and have extremely low heterozygosity values are possible hallmark signatures of hard sweeps based on new mutations. we found five hard sweep candidates  that contain  <dig> genes, with enrichment of go terms related to acetaldehyde dehydrogenase  activity, organic cation transmembrane transporter activity, active transmembrane transporter activity, and a variety of metabolic processes . similar enrichment patterns were also found in a desiccation resistance study of differentiation expression genes in drosophila mojavensis  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes from the sweep regions shared by our desiccation lines were listed by rajpurohit et al.  <cit>  as genes differentially expressed in d. mojavensis under desiccation stress .fig.  <dig> heterozygosity and tajima’s d values plotted against the putative selective sweep signatures  along chromosomal arm 3 l in a three d. melanogaster desiccation lines , and b the negative control lines . horizontal color blocks correspond to putative sweep regions: line-specific , experimental group –specific , shared by all groups , and no sweep 



all of the  <dig> non-synonymous sites with the same allele fixed in all control lines and two out of the three desiccation lines, but with an alternative allele fixed in the remaining desiccation line, fell within the hmm-identified sweep regions. seven of the snps unique for a single desiccation lines were also located in a sweep region reported only in that line , consistent with a hard sweep pattern. three of the  <dig> snps from one block , containing genes cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  were located in putative sweep regions shared by all three desiccation lines.

positive selection tests with mkt and ka/ks
using the mcdonald-kreitman test , we found  <dig> genes likely under positive selection  and  <dig> genes under negative selection  when control and desiccation groups were compared . positively selected genes include mucin 68ca, an extracellular matrix structural constituent  <cit> , characterized by  <dig> fixed non-synonymous substitutions between control and desiccation groups. another gene under positive selection, foraging , is involved in functions related to sucrose response  <cit> , regulation of heart contraction  <cit> , and feeding behavior  <cit> . ninjurin a, involved in cell adhesion  <cit>  and tissue regeneration  <cit> , is an example of a gene likely under negative selection. eight of these  <dig> genes fell in soft sweep regions  but none of them in hard sweep regions . we also calculated the ka/ks ratios using fixed genotypes in each group, and found  <dig> genes with ka/ks ratio greater than  <dig> . among these genes,  <dig>  showed one fixed non-synonymous substitution- but no fixed synonymous substitution-difference between desiccation and control group. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes with positive selection of mkt also had ka/ks greater than  <dig> . the  <dig> genes with ka/ks greater than  <dig> showed a significant enrichment of go terms related to gastrulation and detection of chemical stimulus . although immediate relevance of these go terms to desiccation is unclear, it is likely that pleiotropic activities of genes involved are more directly related to desiccation. for example, genes belonging to the “gastrulation” go, such as sog , are not only responsible for amnion and serosa development, but also contribute to ectoderm and cuticle formation, with plausible implications for desiccation tolerance  <cit> . overall, these results show that selection for desiccation resistance is a very potent evolutionary force leading to adaptive differentiation. to summarize this differentiation, we computed per-site fst values based on > <dig> million snps. average pairwise fst values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  among selected and control lines, respectively, compared to  <dig>  – the average fst for all selection-control line combinations.table  <dig> mkt between control group and desiccation group

discussion
we notice that genomic signatures of adaptive responses to directional selection for increased desiccation resistance are highly convergent among selected lines, a pattern consistent with soft selective sweeps operating on standing genetic variation, similar to that found by others . however, unlike burke et al.  <cit> , who analyzed genomes of d. melanogaster selected for accelerated development for over  <dig> generations, we found numerous sites brought to fixation in the selected lines, including a number of line-specific fixations with signatures of classic, or hard, sweeps in the immediate vicinity. in the selected lines, fixed non-synonymous substitutions shared by all three selected lines were about  <dig> times more abundant than fixed non-synonymous substitutions limited to only one selected line, and line-convergent signatures of selective sweeps were ~ <dig> times more abundant than line-specific selective sweep signatures. these estimates confirm that albeit soft sweeps are expected to leave more subtle footprints on population genomic data compared with hard sweeps, the former actually emerges as the dominant mode of rapid adaptations in drosophila  <cit> . these results also suggest that availability of beneficial mutations for rapid adaptations is not a severely limiting factor in d. melanogaster. conversely, hard sweeps are predicted to be dominant only:  in consistently small populations;  when adaptation is driven by weak selection in populations of significantly fluctuating size; or  when the adaptive mutation rate is very low, such as when only a specific combination of mutations is adaptive whereas individual mutations are not  <cit> .

we singled out a number of line-specific sweep regions with extremely low heterozygosity or tajima’s d values, and high fixation rate of the line-unique alleles, including non-synonymous substitutions, as potential hard sweep examples. however, rather than having originated from new beneficial mutations, these putative hard sweep regions, as confirmed by our simulations , may have actually started from preexisting low-frequency variants unique to a single haplotype background  <cit> . under such a scenario the spread and subsequent fixation of the beneficial haplotype could have led to the observed characteristic loss of heterozygosity in a single population, while the beneficial variant might have been lost in the remaining populations due to drift at the low initial frequency, thus resulting in genomic signatures of hard sweeps without the necessity for selection on new mutations. in particular, three genes from chromosome arm 3 l were affected by these sweeps: ubp64e, scny, and cpr72ec. interestingly, both ubp64e and scny are responsible for protein deubiquitination and stabilization  <cit> , whereas both scny and cpr72ec contribute to the structure, growth, and molting of chitin-based cuticle  <cit> . the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation has been known to play an important role in desiccation resistance in plants  <cit>  and nematodes  <cit> , while cuticle is instrumental as a barrier against desiccation in terrestrial arthropods, including insects  <cit> . however, pinpointing true targets of selection, especially in soft sweeps, is very difficult without information about ancestral alleles. we tested gene ontology enrichments in the putative sweep regions, but these results only unlikely do represent more than ld effects, or ‘innocent bystanders’  <cit> , especially in the presence of ‘soft shoulders’ originating from hard sweeps  <cit> .

similar to our study, but using hypoxic stress for directional selection, zhou et al.  <cit>  reported significant enrichment for fixed snps and fairly large genomic regions to have been affected by adaptive responses to the selection regime. they identified  <dig> candidate genes, eight of which were previously implicated in hypoxia or similar phenotypes and  <dig> were linked to the notch pathway. an even more dramatic response to experimental evolution with a high rate of convergent fixation of preexisting alleles was recorded in c. elegans  <cit> . these worm populations were founded with a fixed pair of temperature-sensitive deleterious mutations introgressed into multiple wild genetic backgrounds and allowed to evolve for  <dig> generations with a mixed mating system. near-complete fixation, rather than moderate changes in allele frequencies, occurred throughout almost the entire genome in these populations, and entire chromosomal segments became fixed due to strong selection and low effective recombination rates  <cit> .

a selective sweep generates an effectively linked region around the sweeping site, and the region size grows with the strength of positive selection and shrinks with recombination rate  <cit> . the mode and intensity of selection might also explain why adaptive alleles are driven to fixation in some experimental evolution experiments with d. melanogaster  but not in others  <cit> . allele frequencies may plateau without becoming fixed due to heterozygote overdominance or selection on a complex trait with several contributing loci, in which case adaptive allele trajectories are expected to rapidly incline as long as the trait is far away from the fitness optimum, but taper off as the optimum is being approached  <cit> .

given the fact that we also recorded signatures of selective sweeps in the negative control lines, even though at least  <dig> times less extensive than in experimental lines, suggests a high rate of false discovery rate, experimental noise or inadvertent laboratory selection. alternatively, long-range ld in our experimental populations could have arisen as a byproduct of the founders being a small sample of the much larger population, leading to a sampling error and spurious correlations between sites separated by large distances  <cit> . however, observed at the same time pervasive convergence among experimental replicates suggests that sampling error is likely negligible.

CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate the utility of the experimental evolution approach in exploring how patterns of genomic differentiation are shaped by selection for stress resistance. desiccation, the equilibration of an organism to the relative humidity of the surrounding atmosphere, is an intense stress factor leading to rapid adaptive responses in drosophila under experimental evolution settings. experimental lines of d. melanogaster subject to desiccation stress over  <dig> generations exhibited rapid resistance increase, accompanied by a high fixation rate and genetically parallel signatures of positive selection in coding sequences, consistent with soft selective sweep patterns.
