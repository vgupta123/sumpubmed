BACKGROUND
array-based comparative genomic hybridization  allows the identification of genome-wide dna gains and losses in cancers and genetic diseases  <cit> . an ideal acgh platform should possess the following features: 1) it should be available to study a broad range of organisms. unfortunately, acgh microarrays are commercially available for human and mouse studies only, leaving out other model organisms for dna copy number studies. 2) the acgh platform should be commercially available worldwide to make results from different laboratories easily comparable. in-house microarrays frequently show less reproducibility than commercial products  <cit> . the microarray quality control consortium  study highlighted once again that in-house microarrays generate a much higher coefficient of variation for expression signals compared to commercial products  <cit> . comparison of results generated at independent laboratories is frequently problematic when different probes are used at different laboratories. 3) probes should span short regions to provide detailed information on regions of copy number variation ; bac clones, used as acgh probes  <cit> , due to their average probe length being several ten thousand nucleotides, inherently can not measure small amplified or deleted regions. 4) the platform should provide small spacing between probes to generate high density maps of cnvs; the only commercially available bac acgh array available measures at a median resolution of one megabase  <cit> . 5) individual measurements should provide reliable data to avoid necessity of averaging multiple measurements, resulting in decreased resolution. long oligonucleotide arrays  <cit>  and snp microarrays  <cit>  depend on averaging signals from multiple probes  <cit>  to eliminate false positive measurements, resulting in decreased resolution. 6) cnv measurements should be easily correlated with expression data when the same samples are studied on the genomic and transcriptomic level. bac clones and probes designed for snp measurement inherently are not specifically designed to interrogate transcribed genes. therefore, combining dna copy number and expression data needs strong bioinformatics support  <cit> . 7) the analytical procedure should interrogate the entire genome; the dna labeling protocol for snp microarrays depends on complexity reduction, leaving out significant parts of the genome from analysis  <cit> .

here we present gene resolution analysis of copy number variation , a method utilizing the most frequently used expression microarray platform for acgh. for human and mouse studies, this platform provides over  <dig>  measurements across the genome . furthermore, the same technology is available for more than a dozen other organisms with comparable genome coverage. the probes are short oligonucleotides and probe sets span on average short chromosomal regions. without complexity reduction, genomic dna is fragmented, labeled and hybridized to these microarrays. after re-annotation of probe sets for interrogation of genomic dna, wpp, a data analysis algorithm originally developed for expression analysis, is utilized for calculation of dna copy number variation. since the vast majority of acgh data available today has been generated using bac microarrays  <cit> , gracnv results have been compared to results from bac microarrays with high genome coverage  <cit> .

RESULTS
properties of the u <dig> plus  <dig>  expression array as an acgh tool
the u <dig> plus  <dig>  array provides over  <dig>  probe sets interrogating the human genome and over  <dig>  of the probe sets measure cnvs directly within transcribed genes . with over  <dig>  genes measured on the u <dig> plus  <dig>  array, the majority of the predicted  <dig>  to  <dig>  human genes  <cit>  is covered. probe sets interrogate short regions and density of probe sets is high. the 19k bac microarray used for comparison has even higher genome coverage but probes are much longer .

benefits of the wpp algorithm
rma, a standard data analysis algorithm for calculation of expression estimates from affymetrix genechips  <cit>  was used initially for calculation of dna copy number differences. principle components analysis  of rma data grouped the normal control dnas together but separated sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l . these two cell lines were derived from the same cell line  and have only been propagated by two different laboratories for approximately ten passages independently. therefore, sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l should be similar to each other and should cluster together. pca of wpp estimates grouped the normal control dnas together, clearly separated from the cell lines and within the cell lines, sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l showed most closely related results . hierarchical clustering of wpp estimates similarly groups related samples together , whereas rma estimates again separated the two closely related cell lines sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l . therefore, further analysis was performed using wpp estimates of dna copy numbers.

detection of copy number variations in large chromosomal regions
for large chromosomal regions, circular binary segmentation  yields similar pictures of amplification and deletion in imr- <dig> neuroblastoma cells  from bac arrays and expression arrays. two highly amplified regions on chromosome  <dig>  and one surrounding  <dig> mb) are well known in neuroblastoma  <cit> . the amplicon at  <dig> mb contains the mycn oncogene and its amplification status is used for clinical sub-classification of neuroblastoma  <cit> . deletions of 1p and 11q, as well as gains of 17q are also hallmarks of neuroblastoma  <cit>  and all of these copy number variations were observed in imr- <dig> cells by both platforms. the major differences observed between copy number measurements by bac arrays and expression arrays affect centromeric regions . these regions are highly polymorphic in normal genomic dna <cit> ; therefore, we speculate that these differences are caused by the different normal control dnas used for both platforms. for the remaining cell lines sk-n-as, sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l, bac acgh and gracnv also provided similar pictures of copy number variations for large chromosomal regions too . for sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l, two sub-cultures of sk-n-sh, the observed overall picture of copy number variation compared to normal dna was very similar except for an additional amplification on 1q present in sk-n-sh/l . this amplification was observed by both cgh platforms.

high resolution analysis of copy number variations
at higher resolution, bac acgh and gracnv again provide similar pictures of amplifications and deletions in cancer cell lines. in imr- <dig> cells, two recently discovered sub-amplicons at  <dig> and  <dig> mb of chromosome two  <cit>  have been identified by cbs in gracnv data, while only the sub-amplicon at  <dig> mb was identified in bac acgh data . in sk-n-sh/g cells, segmentation identified from gracnv data a deletion of less than one mb at  <dig>  mb of chromosome eight , which was not automatically detected in bac acgh data . gracnv provides information from four independent probe sets on this deletion. bac acgh as used herein, with more than  <dig> percent genome coverage provided information from one bac clone only. bac acgh provided information on two further amplicons in 2p  in imr- <dig> cells. these regions are not covered by the u <dig> plus  <dig>  array .

detection of copy number variations between normal genomic dnas at a single gene locus
genomic dna of normal healthy individuals has been discovered during the last years to harbor a high number of copy number variant regions . as an example, we show a region on chromosome  <dig>  know to harbor the well-characterized cnv of the c4/cyp21a <dig> locus  <cit> . normal, healthy individuals with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies of the c4/cyp21a <dig> locus have been identified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis . this gene-level cnv is represented in the gracnv data .

connection of cnv and expression data
gracnv utilizes expression arrays for cnv measurements and therefore the same microarray can be used for analysis of gene expression. genomic and transcriptomic data can be combined easily. as an example, we show combined dna copy number and expression data of the megabladder mouse model. an approximately  <dig> mb region of chromosome  <dig> was duplicated in this mouse mutant , as identified by fish analysis. gracnv showed il1rap, a gene within the amplicon to be excluded from higher copy numbers , a finding confirmed by quantitative pcr . expression analysis showed four of the five amplified genes to be overexpressed in mutant whole embryos , while the bladder  showed over-expression of three genes only .

discussion
our study shows that the most frequently used commercial oligonucleotide expression microarray platform  can be utilized for measurement of copy number variation. after re-annotation of probe sets, these expression arrays provide a high-resolution platform for cnv analysis.

many acgh platforms depend on averaging measurements from adjacent loci  to remove noise and avoid false positive reports of copy number variation  <cit> . gracnv on the other hand, reports the bias-corrected median of measurements from eleven adjacent probes within a probe set. therefore, gracnv shows low false discovery rates  and further averaging is not vital. affymetrix expression arrays provide for many genes more than one probe set for measurement. to allow easy interpretation of results, we averaged results of multiple probe set measuring the same gene. an even higher resolution of cnv analysis could be accomplished when the newly released expression arrays for measurement of individual exons  would be utilized.

for sample labeling, we used standard chemistry for snp analysis from the same provider, hybridization and washing protocols are also well established by many laboratories for snp analysis. therefore, it should be easy to adapt gracnv by other laboratories. affymetrix currently provides expression microarrays for over  <dig> organisms and gracnv can be applied to all of these organisms. additionally, gracnv provides copy number information comparable to data generated using one of the highest density bac acgh arrays available.

hybridization of genomic dna to expression arrays produces higher background cross-hybridization  than hybridization of labeled mrna transcripts. we speculate that the reason why the rma algorithm failed to identify the close similarity of two cell lines derived from the same donor was because rma did not correct for sequence-specific differences in background. wpp, the algorithm introduced here for cnv measurements, utilizes mismatch probe signals for sequence-specific background correction and has been used successfully for expression analysis by one of our laboratories for several years.

due to the fact that gracnv uses a one chip per sample principle, the range of cnvs within normal genomic dnas can be taken into consideration for measurement of disease-related cnvs and a free software for this calculation is provided on our website <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study describes a novel method of gene resolution analysis of copy number variation  yielding high-resolution maps of dna copy number changes and applicable to a broad range of organisms for which commercial oligonucleotide expression microarrays are available. results are comparable to bac acgh with high genome coverage. due to the standardized oligonucleotide microarrays, gracnv results can be compared between laboratories and can easily be combined with gene expression data using the same platform.
