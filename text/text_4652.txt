BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica is a gram-negative enteric bacterium that comprises about  <dig> serovars  <cit> . while some have a restricted host range , most of the s. enterica serovars can infect a broad range of warm-blooded animals and humans. s. enterica infects its hosts by the oral route and primarily causes two types of disease: a gastroenteritis characterized by the development of bacteria in the intestinal tract  <cit> , and typhoid fever that results from the invasion of the systemic compartment  <cit> . typhoid fever is a serious health issue in developing countries  <cit>  but is rare in the western world. in contrast, salmonella gastroenteritis is an important concern worldwide. food products, including poultry, pork, egg, and milk constitutes an important source of salmonella infection in humans  <cit> . salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is a broad host range serovar that infects humans, cattle, mice, and chickens, and is one of the major causes of food-borne human salmonellosis  <cit> .

typhimurium remains an important concern to the poultry industry  <cit>  causing a systemic infection in newly hatched chicks, often resulting in death  <cit> . in older birds infection by typhimurium leads to an asymptomatic carriage state with colonization of the digestive tract and continuous shedding  <cit> . these healthy carrier birds constitute a risk of contamination of newly hatched chickens, as well as the food chain leading to both important economic losses and potential harm to human consumers.

the pathogenesis of salmonella has been extensively studied in the mouse  <cit> . in susceptible mice, salmonella causes an acute systemic disease with limited intestinal manifestations  <cit> . recently, a model of salmonella enterocolitis has been developed in streptomycin-treated mice  <cit> . studies using these mice and other animal models of salmonella diseases have yielded substantial data about the molecular players involved at different levels. the salmonella pathogenicity islands   <dig> and  <dig> are two major virulence determinants of s. enterica. they encode type iii secretion systems  that form syringe-like organelles on the surface of gram-negative bacteria and enable the injection of effector proteins directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells  <cit> . these effectors ultimately manipulate the cellular functions of the infected host and facilitate the progression of the infection. spi <dig> and spi <dig> play several roles in different organs within the host. spi <dig> primarily promotes the invasion of non-phagocytic intestinal epithelial cells and the initiation of the inflammatory responses in the intestines  <cit> . it is also involved in the survival and persistence of salmonella in the systemic compartment of the host  <cit> . the first characterized role of spi <dig> was its ability to promote salmonella survival and multiplication in phagocytic cells that constitute the main reservoirs for dissemination of the bacteria into systemic organs  <cit> . spi <dig> also plays an important role in the intestinal phase of salmonella infection in mice  <cit> .

the regulation of spi <dig> and spi <dig> gene expression involves numerous transcriptional regulators located both inside and outside these pathogenicity islands. the regulation of spi <dig> is particularly complex. spi <dig> encodes for the five regulators hila, hilc, hild, invf, and sprb . the first four of which are involved in regulatory pathways that lead to the activation of spi <dig> genes and of genes encoding t3ss effectors located outside spi <dig>  in contrast to spi <dig> the regulation of spi <dig> genes is simpler with the ssrab two-component system being the only transcriptional regulator encoded within spi <dig> that activates the expression of spi <dig> genes and of genes encoding t3ss effectors located outside spi <dig>  interestingly, spi <dig> regulators can regulate spi <dig> genes. these include hila that binds and represses the promoter of ssah  <cit> , and hild that binds and activates the promoter of the ssrab operon  <cit> . in contrast, ssrab has never been shown to act on the expression of spi <dig> genes.

few studies have investigated the role of spi <dig> and spi <dig> during the infection of chickens. in studies using typhimurium, two approaches have provided data about the roles of spi <dig> and spi <dig>  the first approach compared colonization in chickens by infecting with single strains and enumerating colonies from internal organs. porter and curtiss  <cit>  found that mutations in structural genes of the spi <dig> t3ss resulted in a reduction of the colonization of the intestines in day-old chickens. jones et al.  <cit>  generated strains with deletions of spas and ssau, genes that encode structural proteins of the spi <dig> and spi <dig> t3ss respectively, and compared their ability to colonize the cecum and liver in one-day and one-week old chickens to that of wild type. they concluded that both spi <dig> and spi <dig> play major roles in both the intestinal and the systemic compartments, with spi <dig> contributing more than spi <dig> in both compartments. the second approach screened random transposon libraries for reduced recovery from the chicken gastrointestinal tract through cloacal swabbing. turner et al.  <cit>  analyzed a library of  <dig>  mutants for intestinal colonization in chickens. among the mutants that showed reduced intestinal colonization they found one in which the spi <dig> gene sipc was inactivated. no mutations in spi <dig> genes were identified in this screen. morgan et al.  <cit>  screened a library of  <dig>  mutants in chickens and found two mutations in spi <dig> genes and one in a spi <dig> gene that led to a reduction in colonization ability. the spi <dig> mutants were unable to be recovered from 50% or 100% of the day old birds tested, while the single spi <dig> gene was unable to be recovered in only 33%. in this study fourteen strains with mutations in spi <dig> and fifteen strains with mutations in spi <dig> did not show any defect in colonization. the authors of these two studies concluded that spi <dig> and spi <dig> play a marginal role in the colonization of chicken intestines by typhimurium.

to gain better insight in the role of these important virulence factors we have taken a different approach. first, we performed mixed infections in which the strains that are being compared  are co-administered. this approach more directly addresses the contribution of spi <dig> and spi <dig> by decreasing the animal to animal variations inherent in such studies and giving us the ability to test the fitness of two mutants directly against each other. second, we used one-week-old chicks that are known to be resistant to acute infection by typhimurium  <cit>  allowing us to follow the effect of the studied mutations over a relatively long period of time. third, we used mutants in which the entire spi <dig> and/or the entire structural operon of spi <dig> are deleted . this inactivates all the genes involved in both spi <dig> and spi <dig> t3ss apparatus synthesis and prevents the action of spi <dig> regulators on spi <dig> gene expression. using this approach, we compared the colonization of the wild-type to that of each of the mutants.

we report here that spi <dig> contributes to the colonization of both the cecum and spleen of the chicken. in contrast, spi <dig> contributes to colonization of the spleen but not the cecum and, in the absence of spi <dig>  inhibits cecal colonization. additionally, we show that the contribution of spi <dig> in the spleen is greater than that of spi <dig>  these results differ from those observed during the infection of mice by typhimurium, where spi <dig> plays a major role during systemic colonization.

RESULTS
to assess the roles of spi <dig> and spi <dig> in the colonization of the gut and internal organs of the chicken, we used a mixed infection approach  <cit> . we orally infected one-week old chickens with mixtures of two strains. each strain carried different antibiotic resistance markers providing a simple means of identification. at days three, seven, and fourteen post-infection, groups of chickens were euthanized. the spleen and a sample of cecum from each bird were recovered, processed and plated for enumeration of colonies as described in the methods section. the ratio of the two strains recovered from each organ was determined and compared to the input ratio to determine the competitive index .

in vitro testing of spi <dig> and spi <dig> mutants
all strains containing spi <dig> and spi <dig> mutations were assayed for in vitro growth and invasion of the chicken macrophage cell line mq-nscu  <cit> . all mutants strains grew at approximately the same rate at the parent strain χ <dig> . additionally, all mutants containing the Δspi <dig> mutation were approximately thirty times less invasive than those with an intact spi <dig> 

spi <dig> contributes to the colonization of the cecum and of the spleen in chicken
in chickens infected with the wild type strain and its isogenic mutant lacking the entire spi <dig> , the Δspi <dig> cells were significantly reduced in the ceca at days three  and fourteen  post-infection . at day seven post-infection the difference between the two strains was not significant .

interestingly, the wild type out-competed the Δspi <dig> strain in a more pronounced manner at day fourteen than at days three and seven post infection, suggesting an increased effect of the Δspi <dig> mutation during long-term colonization of the cecum. for the spleen samples, the wild type out-competed the Δspi <dig> strain in all the birds analyzed  with the reduction of the Δspi <dig> cells significant  at the three time points analyzed. together these results show that spi <dig> plays an important role in typhimurium colonization of both the cecum and the spleen in chickens.

spi <dig> contributes to the colonization of the spleen but not of the cecum in one-week-old chickens
in the group of chickens infected with the wild-type and its isogenic mutant lacking the t3ss of spi <dig> , we did not observe significant differences, at any time point, in the cells recovered from cecal samples . these results suggest that spi <dig> does not contribute to the colonization of the chicken cecum by typhimurium. to further test this hypothesis, we performed two co-infection experiments in which the effect of the Δspi <dig> mutation was analyzed in the absence of spi <dig>  in the first experiment, we infected birds with a mixture of the wild type and the Δspi <dig> Δspi <dig> double mutant that lacks both spi <dig> and spi <dig> t3ss in order to test whether it differs from Δspi <dig> with regards to the wild type.

in the second experiment, we infected the chickens with a mixture of the Δspi <dig> and the Δspi <dig> Δspi <dig> strains in order to verify whether the phenotype observed for the Δspi <dig> strain in the mixed infection with the wild type is reproducible when spi <dig> is absent in the two competing strains. there was no significant difference in the cells recovered from the ceca of the chickens infected with the wild type -Δspi <dig> Δspi <dig> mixture . this is in direct contrast with the results from the wild type-Δspi <dig> mixture  and both confirms that the spi <dig> t3ss is not required for colonization of chicken cecum by typhimurium and suggests that the absence of spi <dig> may have a positive influence on cecal colonization. similarly, the Δspi <dig> Δspi <dig> strain significantly out-competed the Δspi <dig> strain in cecal samples at days three and seven post infection . this result is in direct contrast to that obtained from the wild type-Δspi <dig> infection  as when both strains are spi1+ there is no difference in cecal colonization. these results seem to suggest that the presence of the spi <dig> t3ss negatively affects the colonization of the chicken cecum and that the presence of spi <dig> tends to mask this phenotype. altogether, these results both confirm that the spi <dig> t3ss does not contribute to colonization of the chicken cecum by typhimurium, and in spi1- strains actually inhibits cecal colonization.

in contrast to the observations from the cecal samples, spi2+ strains consistently and significantly out-competed isogenic spi2- strains in the spleen. this was observed when comparing the wild type and the Δspi <dig> strain , the wild type and the Δspi <dig> Δspi <dig> double mutant , and the Δspi <dig> and the Δspi <dig> Δspi <dig> strains . collectively, these results show that the spi <dig> t3ss significantly contributes to the colonization of the spleen by typhimurium in one-week-old chicks.

spi <dig> has a greater role than spi <dig> in colonization of the spleen in one-week-old chicks
since spi <dig> and spi <dig> both contribute to splenic colonization and effect cecal colonization differently, we wanted to evaluate the relative importance of each of these virulence determinants. we infected chickens with a mixture of the Δspi <dig> and Δspi <dig> strains and found that the Δspi <dig> strain significantly out-competed the Δspi <dig> strain in the cecal samples  at days three, seven, and fourteen post-infection . these results are consistent with the previous observation that spi2+ cells lacking spi <dig> are significantly out-competed by spi2- bacteria  and confirms that spi <dig>  but not spi <dig>  contributes to cecal colonization.

interestingly, the Δspi <dig> strain also significantly out-competed by the Δspi <dig> strain in the spleen at days three and fourteen post-infection . this result suggests that spi <dig> contributes more than spi <dig> to splenic colonization. since spi <dig> has been shown in several animal models, including the mouse, to be a major factor for the survival of salmonella in the systemic compartment of the host we decided to verify the accuracy of the results we obtained with the Δspi <dig> strain in chicken spleen by performing mixed infection experiments in mice. as expected the Δspi <dig> strain was out-competed by the wild type  and the Δspi <dig> strains  in both the liver and spleen after either intra-peritoneal  or oral  infections. collectively, these results show that in contrast to the mouse, spi <dig> contributes less than spi <dig> to splenic colonization of the chicken.

discussion
spi <dig> and spi <dig> are important virulence determinants of s. enterica serovars that have been extensively studied in several animal models. few studies have investigated the role of spi <dig> and spi <dig> in the colonization of the chicken by typhimurium. these studies have analyzed the colonization of different organs in chickens infected with a wild type strain or with mutants of spi <dig> or spi <dig> in which a single t3ss structural gene was inactivated. to gain better insight in the roles played by spi <dig> and spi <dig> in the chicken we used an approach that combined mixed infections, large deletions in spi <dig> and spi <dig>  and the tracking of infections for fourteen days. we found that spi <dig> contributes to colonization of both the cecum and the spleen in chickens. in contrast, spi <dig> plays a role in the colonization of the spleen, but not of the cecum. furthermore, we show for the first time to our knowledge, that spi <dig> plays a more important role than spi <dig> in colonization of the chicken spleen by typhimurium. we cannot exclude the possibility that the phenotypes conferred by the mutations we constructed resulted from pleiotropic effects given that we deleted the entire spi <dig> and the majority of spi <dig> t3ss genes, and that spi <dig> and spi <dig> regulators have been shown to act on the expression of genes located outside these pathogenicity islands whose functions are unrelated to t3ss  <cit> . this has been reported previously in mice where the deletion of the entire spi <dig> had a different effect than a single gene deletion  <cit> . however, it seems unlikely as other studies have yielded results that are consistent with some of our findings. for instance, two studies that screened transposon mutant libraries of typhimurium for reduced colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract either found mutations in spi <dig> but not in spi <dig>  <cit>  or that spi <dig> mutations had greater influence  <cit> . despite the fact that cecal swabbing was used to recover strains in these two studies, which may fail to catch low level colonization, both studies still identified spi <dig> as important in intestinal colonization. cecal colonization was also reported to decrease substantially after the deletion of spi <dig> t3ss components  <cit> . additionally, a study with s. enterica serovar enteritidis, which displays an infection pattern similar to typhimurium, showed that deletion of the ssra gene, encoding the sensor component of the ssrab two-component system that is the major regulator of the spi <dig> gene expression, did not affect the colonization of the chicken digestive tract  <cit> . all together these results suggest that typhimurium relies less on spi <dig> than on spi <dig> for colonization of the intestinal track in one-week-old chicks.

in contrast, jones et al.  <cit>  analyzed the contribution of spi <dig> and spi <dig> to the colonization of chickens by typhimurium through the deletion of a single t3ss structural gene in each. they concluded that the spi <dig> t3ss was required for systemic infection and played a significant role in the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, while the spi <dig> t3ss was involved in both compartments without being essential  <cit> .

there are several important differences between that study and ours. first, jones et al. used derivatives of the typhimurium f <dig> strain  <cit>  while we used derivatives of the uk- <dig> strain  <cit> . while both have been well characterized for virulence and persistence in chickens, their mean lethal dose  in day of hatch chicks differ by two orders of magnitude with f <dig> at  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu  <cit>  and uk- <dig> at approximately  <dig> ×  <dig>  <cit> . second, they studied mutants in which a single structural t3ss gene was inactivated while in our mutants the entire spi <dig> and all the spi <dig> t3ss structural genes were deleted. third, they determined the level of colonization of the chicken by calculating the bacterial density  in the organs after administration of single strains while we infected the chickens with mixtures of the two strains being compared and determined the competitive index. these differences may account for the differences in the results.

through the use of different combinations of mutants used for infection we have observed that strains harboring the Δspi <dig> mutation have a modest advantage in the colonization of the chicken cecum, and therefore spi <dig> may act to repress some factor needed for cecal colonization. however, this observation was only statistically significant when spi <dig> was absent both in the strain that harbored the Δspi <dig> mutation and the competing strain . we have come to this conclusion based on the above observation in addition to the fact that while the Δspi <dig> is out-competed by the wild type , the double mutant Δspi <dig> Δspi <dig> is not . we do not know the basis of this disadvantage conferred by the presence of spi <dig> in the colonization of chicken cecum by typhimurium. one explanation is that genes deleted from spi <dig> may normally act to repress some factor needed for the colonization of the cecum but in their absence this factor is not repressed, thus increasing invasion. an alternative explanation may be that the phenotype conferred by the Δspi <dig> mutation in not decreasing intestinal colonization results from the absence of spi <dig> regulators, such as hild, that are known to regulate spi <dig> genes, including the ssrab central regulator. additional investigations are needed to test these hypotheses.

in contrast to what we have observed in chickens, spi <dig> is the major contributor for spleen colonization in balb/c mice. the infection by typhimurium in these two animal models leads to different outcomes. in mice, typhimurium causes an acute systemic infection, frequently resulting in death, while in one-week or older chickens, the infection leads to heavy colonization of the intestinal track and asymptomatic carriage. it is interesting to note that in animal models where salmonella infection results in acute systemic disease, spi <dig> is a major player in the systemic infection. these include the infection of mice by typhimurium  <cit> , and the systemic disease in chickens infected by serovars pullorum  <cit>  and gallinarum  <cit> . in contrast, in animals where infection results in healthy carriage, such as in chickens, spi <dig> plays a minor role in the persistence of the bacteria in the systemic compartment. this is demonstrated in the present study, and has been reported for typhimurium in pigs  <cit> , and for serovar enteritidis in chicken  <cit> . this difference in contribution of spi <dig> in these two situations indicates that spi <dig> is an important factor of salmonella host specificity.

CONCLUSIONS
we have taken a mixed infection approach to study the role of spi <dig> and spi <dig> in the colonization of the chicken by typhimurium. we confirmed the contribution of spi <dig> to the colonization of both the cecum and the spleen, and showed that spi <dig> is involved in the colonization of the spleen but not of the cecum and, may have a negative effect on cecal colonization. additionally, we show that spi <dig> plays a greater role than spi <dig> in the colonization of the spleen in chickens. in contrast, spi <dig> is more important than spi <dig> for systemic colonization in mice. the approach we used in this study constitutes a sensitive assay that provided new insights into the role of spi <dig> and spi <dig> during infection.
