BACKGROUND
in the early neural plate, the brain primodium is subdivided into several domains, i.e., neuromeres, to generate regional differences and units  <cit> . the hindbrain primordium is morphologically divided into lineage-restricted functional metameric units called rhombomeres  <cit> . neuroepithelial cells are initially scattered in the hindbrain neuroepithelium, but are sorted gradually into each compartment  <cit> . in the forebrain, that consists of the diencephalon and telencephalon, the primordium is longitudinally divided into prosomeres, which are defined by the expression border of various transcription factors such as homeodomain  proteins  <cit> , and a lineage restriction of neuroepithelial cells between each subdivision has been reported in the caudal diencephalon of the chick embryo  <cit> . in each region of the hindbrain and spinal cord, the neuroepithelium is also regionalized into basal and alar plates, which are separated at a groove called the sulcus limitans. several molecular makers, e.g., hd transcription factors, subdivide the neuroepithelium into several discrete progenitor domains that give rise to different types of neurons along the dorsoventral  axis  <cit> .

previous studies demonstrated the expression of cadherin superfamily genes encoding cell adhesion molecules in the brain and the spinal cord, with distinct expression patterns that correspond with the subdivisions of the brain and the spinal cord  <cit> . these studies proposed that cadherin-mediated differential cell affinity establishes various compartments and regionalizes the neuroepithelium. vertebrate cadherin superfamily genes are categorized into subfamilies, such as classic cadherins, protocadherins, and desmosomal cadherins  <cit> . classic cadherins have cadherin-repeats in an extracellular region called ec  domain and associate with β-catenin and p120-catein in the cytoplasmic domains that connect to the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . the ec <dig> domain of classic cadherin shows adhesive properties that enhance the homophilic binding of cadherin. classic cadherins are categorized into type i and type ii groups with or without conserved amino acids, his-ala-val  within ec <dig> domain  <cit> . the adhesive affinities of type i cadherins have been studied extensively. cells expressing single type i cadherin, such as e-cadherin or n-cadherin, prefer to adhere to those expressing the same cadherin via homophilic interaction rather than heterophilic binding. for example, the neuroectoderm is segregated from the ectoderm by distinct affinity of n-cadherin and e-cadherin during the formation of the neural tube  <cit> . in contrast, r-cadherin and n-cadherin, which are type i cadherins, interact in a heterophilic manner  <cit> , and the adhesive interaction between individual subtypes of type ii cadherin is not always homophilic in nature  <cit> . therefore, the complexity of homophilic and/or heterophilic interactions between each type ii cadherin subtype may be involved in several developmental processes beyond tissue segregation during early embryogenesis.

f-cadherin , a member of type ii classic cadherins, is expressed in the area adjacent to the sulcus limitans, the boundary between the basal and alar plates, which restricts positioning of neuroepithelial cells in xenopus embryos  <cit> . in the chick neural tube, cadherin <dig>  is expressed not only in migratory neural crest cells but also in the domain ventral to the sulcus limitans of the neural tube  <cit> . r-cadherin  and cadherin <dig>  are expressed in the primodia of the mouse cerebral cortex and striatum, respectively, and their differential cell affinities mediate segregation at the corticostriatal boundary  <cit> . other subtypes of classic cadherins also have multiple functions in the developing and adult brain, such as involvement in neuronal migration and connectivity of specific neuronal circuits, and synaptic formation in the brain. for example, cad <dig>  cad <dig> and cad <dig> are observed in specific neural circuits  <cit> , and α n-catenin and n-cadherin, which are localized in the pre- and postsynaptic regions, modulate dendritic spine formation in an activity-dependent manner  <cit> . so far, more than  <dig> members of type ii classic cadherin have been identified. in schwann cell precursors, we reported previously the expression of rat cad <dig> gene  <cit> , which is a type ii subtype clustered with cad <dig> and cad <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  in mice, cad <dig> is expressed only in adult tissues  <cit> , whereas cad <dig>  a f-cad homologue, is expressed in early neural tissues  <cit> . however, little is known about the expression patterns of cad <dig> and cad <dig> in the developing and adult rodent brains. in this study, we focused on cad <dig> and cad <dig> genes and analyzed their expression patterns in the developing and adult rat brains. the results showed that the expression borders of cad <dig> and cad <dig> corresponded with those of regional compartments and boundaries, which were marked with the expression of region-specific transcription factors. cad <dig> and cad <dig> were also expressed in neurons of several nuclei that form the cerebellar/precerebellar circuitry in the late embryonic and adult hindbrain. the results suggest the contribution of cad <dig> and cad <dig> in the formation of compartment/boundary and specific neuronal circuitry in the rat hindbrain.

RESULTS
isolation of rat cad <dig> and cad20
to examine the expression of rodent homologues of chick cad <dig> and xenopus f-cad, we searched for rat genome sequences orthologous to chick cad <dig> and xenopus f-cad. we found highly conserved sequences on rat chromosome 13p <dig> and cloned cdnas covering open reading frames  of putative rat cad <dig> and cad <dig> proteins by rt-pcr . classic cadherins consist of ec domains , a transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domains. the putative orf of rat cad <dig> encoded  <dig> amino acids and the protein showed 92% similarity with chick cad <dig>  <cit> , and 96% similarity with human cad <dig>  <cit>  . the putative orf of rat f-cad encoded  <dig> amino acids, and the protein had 76% similarity with xenopus f-cad  <cit>  , 86% similarity with chick mn-cadherin   <cit>  and 95% similarity with human cdh <dig>  a homologue of f-cad  <cit>  . β-catenin and p <dig> catenin binding sites were conserved within the cytoplasmic domains of rat cad <dig> and cad <dig> proteins, which showed 72% and 63% identities, respectively . the ec <dig> and ec <dig> domains of cad <dig> and cad <dig> proteins were highly conserved with 82% identities . these results indicate that our two-cloned type ii classic cadherins are homologues of chick cad <dig> and xenopus f-cad.

human cdh <dig>  cdh <dig> and cdh <dig> genes are clustered on chromosome18q22-p <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, we examined whether similar gene clusters are conserved in the rat, mouse and chick genomes. cad <dig> and cad <dig> genes were closely localized in the same chromosome with cad <dig> . it is noteworthy that in the chick genome, the position of cad <dig>  mn-cad and cad <dig>  <cit>  gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> is different from that of cad <dig> and cad <dig> on human, rat, and mouse genomes .

region-specific expression of cad <dig> in the developing rat embryo
we first examined the expression patterns of cad <dig> in the rat embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization. expression of cad <dig> mrna appeared at the edge of the anterior neural plate at embryonic day   <dig> – <dig>  and in the lateral plate at the posterior region . at e <dig>  , rostral expression of cad <dig> was exclusive to the presumptive forebrain, midbrain and caudal neural tube, and then was strongly identified at the edge of the neural plate, which corresponds to neural crest cells . cad <dig> was expressed in migrating neural crest-derived cells in the cephalic region , but disappeared at later stages. at e <dig> , cad <dig> was expressed in the rostral brain regions including the telencephalon, diencephalon and midbrain, and the sharp posterior border of the expression apparently corresponded to the midbrain/hindbrain boundary  . in the caudal hindbrain and the spinal cord, cad <dig> was expressed in the dorsal neuroepithelium but no expression was noted in the roof plate . cad <dig> expression also appeared in the olfactory epithelium, retina, dorsal area of the otic vesicle and the pharyngeal groove at e <dig>  . at e <dig> , the pattern of cad <dig> expression was similar to that at e <dig>  . at e <dig> , cad <dig> expression extended to the cerebral cortex, the diencephalon including the presumptive pretectum , thalamus  and prethalamus , and the dorsal midbrain . immunostaining of the chick diencephalon with antibody against cad <dig> showed that cad <dig> expression demarcated the pretectum, ventral thalamus and the zona limitans intrathalamica  but not the dorsal thalamus  <cit> , suggesting that the cad7-expressing diencephalic region is not conserved in zli and dorsal thalamus in the rat and chick. previous studies demonstrated the expression of cad <dig> in chick neural crest-derived cells including schwann cells and their precursors  <cit> . in e <dig>  rat embryo, cad <dig> mrna was undetectable in the dorsal root ganglia and neural crest-derived migrating cells at the trunk level . we further examined cad <dig> expression in schwann cell precursors at e <dig>   <cit> . we performed in situ hybridization on serial sections for cad <dig> and sox <dig>  a maker of neural crest-derived cells  <cit> , and immunostaining of the same sections with β-tubulin antibody  to detect the nerve of motor neurons . in contrast to the expression of sox <dig> in schwann cell precursors on the motor nerve, cad <dig> was not expressed in these cells . these results suggest that rat cad <dig> gene is activated in the central but not peripheral nervous system during neural development.

expression borders of cad <dig> and cad <dig> are adjacent to those of transcription factors in the early neural plate
since previous reports suggested cadherins expression in specific regions corresponding to prosomere and rhombomere compartments  <cit> , we next examined the expression borders of cad <dig>  cad <dig> and compared their expressions with those of transcription factors showing region-specific expression patterns at early development stages. at e <dig>  , cad <dig> expression became restricted to the anterior region including the forebrain and caudal hindbrain . the anterior border of cad <dig> in the hindbrain corresponded to that of krox <dig> , a zinc-finger transcription factor, at rhombomere  <dig>   <cit> . the expression of cad <dig> was more restricted in the anterior region and overlapped with the expression of six <dig>  <cit> , a hd protein . a previous report showed that the prospective position of the zona limitans intrathalamica  is demarcated by the expression boundaries of six <dig> and irx <dig>  hd transcription factors, in the chick embryo  <cit> . since the posterior border of cad <dig> expression was adjacent to the anterior border of irx <dig> , cad <dig> expression indicates the prospective position of zli in the rat neural plate.

next, we compared the expression domains of cad <dig> and cad <dig> with those of transcription factors at e <dig>  stage . otx <dig> and gbx <dig> are hd transcription factors that establish the mhb with mutual repression  <cit> . remarkably, the posterior border of cad <dig> expression corresponded with the mhb . the second domain of cad <dig> was identified in the hindbrain in r <dig> region at areas positive for gbx <dig>  whilst the expression of otx <dig> was excluded . at e <dig> , the posterior border of cad <dig> in the forebrain became sharper . these results indicate that the expression borders of cad <dig> and cad <dig> correspond to the prosomere and rhombomere boundaries in the early neural plate.

cad <dig> and cad20-expressing domains correspond to progenitor domain boundary along the d-v axis
the hindbrain and spinal cord are subdivided into the basal plate and alar plate, which give rise to both motor/interneurons and interneurons, respectively. the boundary between these plates  is visualized as a groove at the apical surface of the neural tube  <cit> . previous reports suggested that the dorsal borders of xenopus f-cad and chick cad <dig> correspond with the position of the sulcus limitans as defined by hd transcription factors  <cit> , suggesting that the basal/alar boundary can be detected by differential expression of type ii cadherin subtypes as molecular makers. therefore, we investigated whether rat cad <dig> and cad <dig> mark the alar/basal boundary and discrete progenitor domains in the developing hindbrain. at e <dig>  prior to differentiation of interneurons  <cit> , cad <dig> mrna was expressed in dorsal progenitor cells at r6- <dig> in the hindbrain , and cad <dig> was longitudinally expressed in the midline of the hindbrain neuroepithelium at r1- <dig> . to examine the correlation between the expression domain and progenitor domains, which are subdivided by the different expression patterns of hd proteins  <cit> , we performed in situ hybridization using probes for gsh <dig> and dbx <dig>  <cit> . double staining for cad <dig> and dbx <dig> in e <dig>  embryos indicated that the ventral border of cad <dig> was adjacent to the dorsal border of dbx2-domain . although cad <dig> was somewhat expressed in the domain ventral to gsh1-domain, the dorsal border of cad <dig> overlapped with the gsh1-domain .

even at e <dig> , the expression domain of cad <dig> was clearly maintained in neuroepithelial cells in the dorsal hindbrain . the ventral border of cad <dig> coincided with the dorsal border of dbx <dig>  and the cad <dig> domain partially overlapped with the progenitor domains of the dorsal lbx1-expressing interneurons  <cit>  . remarkably, a narrow longitudinal stripe of cad <dig> expression appeared in the ventral region of the hindbrain . this pattern was similar to the ventral expression of cad <dig> in the mouse embryo  <cit> . to elucidate the relationship between the expression domain of cad <dig> and the neural progenitor domain, we compared the expression of cad <dig> with several progenitor domain markers. the results showed similar expression patterns for transcription factor gata <dig> in cad <dig> domain and the v <dig> interneuron progenitor domain   <cit> . cad <dig> expression was also detected in brdu-incorporated s-phase cells . taken together, these results suggest that cad <dig> and cad <dig> are expressed in different progenitor cells in the developing hindbrain.

cad <dig> expression delineates rhombomere boundaries
in the hindbrain, cells at the interface between each rhombomere are specialized as rhombomere boundary cells. interestingly, the expression of cad <dig> was observed in the rhombomere boundary regions , while cad <dig> was continuously expressed along the r1–r <dig> with low level in r <dig> at e <dig>  . in the caudal hindbrain, the expression of cad <dig> was downregulated in the ventral domain . in addition to longitudinal expression in the middle domain throughout the r1- <dig>  cad <dig> specifically marked r <dig> at e <dig>  . at e <dig> , the cad <dig> expression was restricted to the rhombomere boundaries and to the dorsal region of the hindbrain . the transcripts of cad <dig> were accumulated in the cell body of boundary cells that are located in the apical side . the expression of cad <dig> was restricted in the ventral domains of the hindbrain . these results suggest possible distinct affinity of neuroepithelial cells mediated by cad <dig> and cad <dig> in the developing rat hindbrain along the a-p axis.

cad <dig> and cad <dig> expression in motor neurons and precerebellar neurons at later developmental stages
previous studies of mouse and chick embryos showed the expression of subtypes of type i and type ii classic cadherins in motor neurons and precerebellar neurons, and the involvement of such expression in the formation of each motor pool and in cell migration  <cit> . we examined the expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> at later developmental stages in the hindbrain. at e <dig>  in the caudal hindbrain, the expression of cad <dig> was downregulated in the ventricular zone but became detectable in the marginal zone . judging from the expression of islet1/ <dig> in motor neurons, cad <dig> and cad <dig> were apparently expressed in the hypoglossal somatic motor nuclei  . at e <dig> , cad <dig> expression extended beyond the nxii into the vagus motor nuclei  . cad <dig> was still expressed in the nxii at e <dig>  . cad <dig> was also expressed in the dorsal region including the nucleus of solitary tract  and in the intermediate reticular zone  .

in the caudal hindbrain, the migratory stream to form precerebellar nuclei, called the posterior extramural migrating stream , is visualized by the expression of certain makers including hd transcription factors such as pax <dig>  <cit> . pax <dig> is essential for the development of the cerebellum and formation of precerebellar nuclei  <cit> . at e <dig> , pax <dig> was expressed in the external cuneate nucleus  and the lateral reticular nucleus  . interestingly, cad <dig> transcripts were also detected in the pes, ecn and lrt but not in the lower rhombic lip  . cad <dig> mrna expression was also detected in the cad6-expressing medial accessory olive   <cit>  but not in other parts of the inferior olive nucleus  , and in the pontine nucleus  and the reticular nucleus  . we demonstrated previously that xii motor nuclei, ecn and pn were missing in the pax <dig> homozygous mutant rat   <cit> . in fact, the expression of cad <dig> was not detected in normal positions of the nxii, ecn or pn of rsey2/rsey <dig> embryo, although the expression was normally detected in lrt and mao . furthermore, cad <dig> expression in the normal position of the nxii was not detected in rsey2/rsey <dig> embryo .

cad <dig> expression in the external germinal layer of the cerebellum
next, we examined the expression of cad <dig> in the developing cerebellum. at e <dig> , cad <dig> expression overlapped with that of pax <dig> in the external germinal layer  containing progenitors of granule cells that later migrate inwards from egl . on the other hand, cad <dig> expression was not detected in the upper rhombic lip  , but was identified in the deep cerebellar nucleus and the epithelium of the anterior hindbrain , which differed from the expression of pax <dig> . previous studies in the chick cerebellum at later embryonic stages have shown that cad <dig> transcripts are restricted to the purkinje cell layer and internal granular layer  and are not in the egl  <cit> , and that the immunoreactivity of cad <dig> protein is absent in the ventricular zone of the developing cerebellum  <cit> . considered together, the results suggest diversity of cad <dig> expression patterns in the chick and rat cerebellum.

it is has been reported that pax <dig> regulates cell adhesion in the cerebral cortex  <cit>  and cerebellar granule cell precursors  <cit> . r-cadherin is a downstream gene of pax <dig> in the ventricular zone of the developing cerebral cortex  <cit> . cad <dig> expression was still detected in egl cells of the pax <dig> homozygous mutant rat . these results suggest that cad <dig> expression in egl is regulated by a pax6-independent pathway.

cad <dig> and cad <dig> expression in the adult brainstem and cerebellum
in the adult brain, the precerebellar neurons and cerebellar granule cells make synaptic connections. since cad <dig> was expressed in both precerebellar neurons and progenitors for granule cells, we examined its expression in these neuronal cells in the brainstem and cerebellum of the adult rat . cad <dig> was expressed in igl, which contains granule cells, but not in purkinje cells . we also observed scattered cells expressing cad <dig> at high levels in igl . cad <dig> was also expressed in pn and rt, ecn and lrt  but not in io . on the other hand, cad <dig> was expressed in the igl but not in the precerebellar nucleus . the expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> in nx and nxii was maintained in adulthood . these results suggest that the expression of cad <dig> demarcates the precerebellar/cerebellar system in both embryonic and adult brain.

discussion
expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> in early brain subdivision
wizenmann and lumsden analyzed rhombomere cells of the chick embryo by re-aggregation assay and were the first to report that segregation of rhombomere neuroepithelial cells between even and odd rhombomeres was probably mediated by calcium-dependent molecules such as cadherins  <cit> . however, the candidate cadherin molecules expressed in specific rhombomeres or rhombomere boundary cells have not yet been identified in the chick embryo. on the other hand, other studies reported r-cad mrna expression in the midbrain and odd number of rhombomeres, as well as cad <dig> expression in even number of rhombomeres in the mouse neural plate  <cit> . interestingly, in our analysis, we found specific expression of cad <dig> in the r <dig> of the rat embryo at e <dig>   and that the posterior limit of cad <dig> expression was consistent with that of otx <dig> at e <dig>  . taking into consideration the transient expression of r-cad and cad <dig> at early stages and distinct cell adhesiveness of different cadherins, it is conceivable that classic cadherin subtypes including cad <dig> are involved in segregation of cells at the interface between rhombomeres in rodent embryos. taken together, it is likely that distinct cadherin subtypes mediate compartmentalization, although further studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.

lineage restriction of neuroepithelial cells in diencephalic subdivisions has been elucidated in the chick embryo  <cit> . the chick diencephalon is firstly subdivided into three regions; the presumptive pretectum, dorsal thalamus, and ventral thalamus. previous studies suggested that differential expression of types i and ii cadherins demarcates diencephalic subdivisions in the chick and mouse embryos  <cit> . in the present study, the expression of cad <dig> overlapped with that of cad <dig> in the rat neural plate in the forebrain region. furthermore, a previous cell lineage analysis suggested that the midbrain/diencephalon boundary restricts cell mixing  <cit> , and that cad <dig> delineates the midbrain/diencephalon boundary in the mouse neural plate  <cit> . in fact, the posterior border of cad <dig> became clearer at e <dig>  compared with at e <dig>  and the sharp expression boundary was maintained at e <dig>  as in the case of otx <dig> expression . otx <dig> regulates the cell adhesion property of neuroepithelial cells in mice  <cit> , and overexpression of otx can induce cell aggregation in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . zli is not a cell population derived from specialized cells at p2/ <dig> boundary, but is itself a compartment that originates from the area that does not express lunatic fringe   <cit> . the p2/ <dig> border is demarcated by the expression of six <dig> and irx <dig> in the early neural plate  <cit> , where zli is established. however, in the early neural plate, whether the p2/ <dig> boundary restricts cell mixing has not been elucidated in both avian and rodent embryos. interestingly, we found that the posterior border of cad <dig> expression was consistent with the p2/ <dig> border, which is mediated by mutual repression of six3/fez1/fez like <dig> and irx3/irx <dig>   <cit> . our finding suggests the involvement of cad <dig> restricted expression in establishment of zli-signalling centre formed at the p2/ <dig> boundary.

expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> in the hindbrain progenitor domains and rhombomere boundary
although the hindbrain and spinal cord are subdivided into the basal and alar plates at the sulcus limitans defined by a morphological groove in the vertebrates, a recent study using molecular markers has shown that the basal/alar boundary corresponds to the dorsal border of cad <dig> expression in the chick neural tube  <cit> . our study showed that longitudinal expression of cad <dig> resembles those of chick cad <dig> and xenopus f-cad at the hindbrain level   <cit>  and that the sulcus limitans in the rat hindbrain is somewhat related to the expression of cad <dig>  remarkably, along the anterior-posterior  axis, cad <dig> mrna expression was gradually downregulated in the basal plate from r <dig> to the spinal cord, and restricted in v <dig> interneuron progenitor cells . moreover, the cad7-expressing domain continued through the caudal hindbrain to the spinal cord , suggesting that the basal/alar boundary could be established or maintained by distinct cadherin subtypes in the rostral hindbrain and spinal cord. it was noteworthy that both cad <dig> and cad <dig> were expressed at r <dig> in e <dig>  along the d-v axis , and double staining for dbx2/cad <dig> and gsh1/cad <dig> showed partial overlap of cad <dig> and cad <dig> expression at r <dig> level in the e <dig>  hindbrain . since heterophilic adhesion has been reported within distinct type ii cadherins  <cit> , and ec <dig>  which is a critical sequence for calcium-dependent adhesion, is highly conserved between cad <dig> and cad <dig> proteins , determination of the adhesion properties of cad <dig> and cad <dig> proteins should be the next research priority.

in the ventral spinal cord and hindbrain, transcription factors such as pax, nkx and dbx families regulate the formation of progenitor domains by hd codes and specification of neuronal subtypes by mutual repression activities  <cit> . in the chick spinal cord, ectopically expressed pax <dig> can repress cad <dig> in the ventral region and shh can induce cad <dig> in the dorsal region  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that rat cad <dig> and cad <dig> are regulated by shh signalling pathway.

a previous study indicated that segregation of boundary cells is mediated by radical fringe-mediated activation of the notch signalling pathway in the zebrafish hindbrain  <cit> . in the mouse, although three fringe genes are not expressed at rhombomere boundaries  <cit> , expression of hes <dig>  a target gene of notch signalling, persists at high levels in boundary cells in the hindbrain  <cit> . rhombomere boundary cells exhibit a static feature contrary to rhombomere centre cells, i.e., a slow rate of proliferation and interkinetic nuclear migration, and their nuclei are located on the ventricular surface  <cit> . since cad <dig> expression in rhombomere boundaries actually starts after the formation of boundaries, such expression at rhombomere boundaries implicates differential cell adhesiveness between boundary and non-boundary cells in maintenance of boundary cells. considering the expression of cad <dig> in zli, a boundary in the chick diencephalon  <cit> , our findings could be interpreted to mean that cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell contact serves to restrict intermingling of boundary cells and compartment cells, thereby maintaining boundary regions.

expression of cad <dig> in precerebellar neurons and cerebellum during late embryonic and adult periods
interestingly, the expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> mrnas in the neuroepithelium disappeared by e <dig> , and their expression was detected in postmitotic neurons in the pons and medulla oblongata . previous studies reported that cadherins also contribute to cell migration in the brain  <cit> . in the cerebellum, purkinje cells are generated from epithelial progenitor cells and migrate to the deep layer  <cit> . experimentally, cad <dig> and cad6b-overexpressed progenitor cells preferentially migrated into purkinje cell domain, which endogenously expresses these cadherins in the chick cerebellum  <cit> . the lower rl cells generate four types of precerebellar neurons to form the pontine, reticulotegmental, lateral reticular and external cuneate nuclei  <cit> . these precerebellar neurons project to the granule cells in the cerebellum  <cit> . the dorsal cells of the caudal hindbrain generate the inferior olive neurons, and express cadherin subtypes, e.g., cad <dig>  cad <dig> and cad <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, at later stages, we observed switching of cad <dig> expression from epithelial cells to migrating postmitotic neurons. although the expression of various cadherin subtypes in precerebellar neurons had been reported previously  <cit> , the expression of cad <dig> was more specifically detected than that of other cadherins in all precerebellar nuclei. neurons expressing cad <dig>  aggregated at late embryonic stages , suggesting the involvement of cad <dig> in cell sorting mechanisms, in agreement with the functions of type ii classic cadherin subtypes in the chick spinal cord  <cit> .

we found sparse cad <dig> expression in precerebellar neurons in the adult hindbrain . the cadherin-catenin complex including n-cadherin/αn-catenin is involved in the formation of synaptic contact  <cit> . furthermore, recent studies have shown that type ii subtypes, cad <dig> and cad <dig>  also have specific roles in synaptic function including modulation of long-term potential and neurotransmission  <cit> , and that cad <dig> has an important role in transmission of sensory information from sensory neurons to the dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord  <cit> . therefore, the expression pattern of cad <dig> in the hindbrain and cerebellum suggests that cad <dig> may physiologically modulate the cerebellar/precerebellar neural circuitry.

genomic organization of cad20/cad19/cad <dig> cluster and expression among different species
cadherin family genes evolutionally duplicated  <cit>  and formed as several clusters on chromosomes  <cit> . in the human genome, cdh <dig> /cdh <dig> /cdh <dig>  and cdh8/cdh11/cdh13/cdh <dig> are located on chromosome 16q21/ <dig>  <cit> , and cdh20/cdh19/cdh <dig> are clustered on 18q22- <dig>  <cit> . comparison of the expression of such clustered cadherin genes among distinct species is important in order to identify common control element. however, our results showed that the distribution of rat cad <dig> and cad <dig> to that of cad <dig> was inconsistent with the localization of their homologues in the chick . chick cad <dig> is also expressed in neural crest-derived cells as well as in the ventral neural tube  <cit> . our previous and present studies showed that cad <dig> but not cad <dig> was expressed in the neural crest cell lineage at the trunk level in the rat  <cit> , suggesting that the distribution of cad <dig> and cad <dig> genes is associated with their expression patterns. however, the expression of chick cad <dig> was detected in part of neural crest-derived cells and neural tube but not in the dorsal domain and rhombomere boundary cells in the hindbrain . taken together, our analysis suggests that the expression patterns of clustered cad20/cad19/cad <dig> genes are regulated by species-specific gene regulatory elements in avian and rodent embryos, which is in contrast to the highly conserved expression patterns of hd protein genes in the central nervous system.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrated that cell populations that express cad <dig> and cad <dig> are diversified in the rat and chick. the expression of these cadherin subtypes demarcates compartments, boundaries, progenitor domains, specific nuclei and circuits during mammalian hindbrain development.
