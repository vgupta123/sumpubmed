BACKGROUND
roses have been used as garden ornamental plants and cut flowers for centuries, which are characterized by recurrent flowering; however, little is known about the genetic and molecular basis of the floral transition in the species. the timing of the floral transition is mediated by complex regulatory networks that constantly monitor environmental and endogenous cues.

enormous progress has been made in research on the genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors that trigger the transition from vegetative growth to flowering in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. environmental factors, photoperiod, and vernalization pathways mediate the transition to flowering in cooperation with diverse exogenous cues, including autonomous, gibberellin , trehalose-6-phosphate , and age-dependent pathways  <cit> . in combination, all these pathways converge to mediate a set of “floral integrator genes,” including flowering locus t , suppressor of overexpression of constans <dig> , constans , flowering locus c , and the meristem identity genes leafy , apetala <dig> , and fruitfull , which irreversibly confer the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive meristem  <cit> . however, perennial plants do not die after flowering; instead, they appropriately accomplish the conversion from vegetative to reproductive development once or multiple times per year. studies of annual plants cannot completely uncover the mechanisms of floral transition that underlie perennial plants, such as the rose recurrent flowering.

a few flowering genes have recently been identified in the rose. est sequencing using cdna libraries has been used to identify candidate genes, e.g., rocol, rorga, rogi, and rosoc <dig>  involved in rose floral transition  <cit> . plant hormone signal transduction is involved in the floral transition process in a. thaliana  <cit> , and auxin, ethylene, and gibberellin signaling genes are also involved in rose floral transition  <cit> . in contrast, the role of ga in flowering in perennial plants is inconsistent with its role in arabidopsis  <cit> . ga is an inhibitor of floral transition in nonrecurrent roses, ga metabolism genes, roga20ox, encoding an enzyme of active ga synthesis, was down-regulated in floral transition, whereas roga2ox, encoding a ga inactivation enzyme, was upregulated  <cit> . the tfl <dig> homology roksn, was reported to regulate continuous flowering in the rose, and the function of roksn caused continuous flowering  <cit> . the application of ga <dig> promoted the accumulation of roksn in nonrecurrent roses during spring, while it inhibited floral transition. however, it had no function during summer, while other factors control roksn in nonrecurrent rose. in the recurrent rose, due to the insertion of a copia retrotransposon, the expression level of roksn was kept low year-round, and exogenous ga <dig> did not affect the floral transition in recurrent rose at any time  <cit> . randoux, et al.  <cit>  validated that ectopic expression of roksn impeded the floral induction in r. hybrid ri. however, the ksn
copia allele has not been found in r. rugosa ‘hamanasu’, which can also flower continuously. this suggests that roksn is not the only factor that controls the trait of recurrent flowering  <cit> ; it is likely that other factors can affect the character. rosa chinensis ‘old blush’ is a common ancestor of modern roses, and exhibits recurrent flowering, and may thus provide the best material to study the molecular mechanism of floral transition in the rose.

the roles of several key regulatory genes involved in the rose floral transition have been examined; however, the composition and mechanisms of the underlying global regulatory networks at the transcriptome level are still poorly understood. we used a high-throughput next-generation sequencing platform to sequence cdna libraries at three stages of the rose flower transition process. we mined global differentially expressed genes  or novel transcripts and isoforms involved in the rose floral transition. our results demonstrated that the degs between the vm and tm stages play a key role in regulating floral transition. these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate the floral transition in rose.

RESULTS
morphological description of the rose flowering transition
based on the morphological changes in the shoot apical meristem , we divided the continuous differentiation process from the vegetative to reproductive meristem into three stages in r. chinensis ‘old blush’ as follows: vegetative meristem , pre-floral meristem , and floral meristem  . initially, at the vm stage, the shoot length was less than or equal to  <dig>  cm, and meristems were flat and narrow . at tm, meristems became broader and hunched into a dome shape, with shoots of  <dig> – <dig>  cm; the first 5-leaflet leaf was visible, but did not unfold . at conic apices, the primordia were positioned higher than those at the vm stage. this was designated the floral transition stage, at which the shoot apex transformed from vegetative to reproductive growth. at the fm stage, the first 5-leaflet leaf prepared to unfold and the shoots were longer than  <dig>  cm . importantly, the sepal primordia were visible , the meristem initiated flower development, and differentiated sepals, petals, pistils, and so on were observed .fig.  <dig> morphology change of floral transition in rose. a shown are axillary buds from rosa chinensis ‘old blush’ at different stages. the floral transition process was analyzed at a histological level: vegetative meristem, vm ; pre-floral meristem, tm ; floral meristem, fm 




sugar and hormone contents during the flower transition process
the total sugar and starch levels were analyzed in the shoots at three stages during the flowering transition process. in shoots, the total sugar content increased by  <dig> % from vm to tm, but decreased by  <dig> % between tm and fm . in addition, the starch content decreased by  <dig> % between vm and tm, and then decreased sharply by  <dig> % from tm to fm .fig.  <dig> total sugar and starch contents of shoots during the floral transition process in the rose. a sugar content and b starch content. values are means of three replicates ± se

sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the rose transcriptome
a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained. after low-quality reads were filtered out,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were selected for further analysis . finally,  <dig>  unigenes with a mean size of 814 bp were assembled, which lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp . in total,  <dig> % of the unigenes were annotated using at least one database with an e-value threshold of < <dig>  ; the database annotation results are summarized in fig.  <dig>  among  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   and  <dig>   were annotated using the ncbi nr database and the swiss-prot protein database, respectively. based on a go analysis,  <dig>   unigenes were successfully annotated using gene ontology  assignments and classified into three go categories: cellular component, biological process, and molecular function . in addition,  <dig>   unigenes were assigned to  <dig> pathways using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database .table  <dig> throughput and quality of rna-seq of dge libraries

identification of differentially expressed genes using digital gene expression tags
the repeatability of the differential gene expression  libraries was evaluated using a pca analysis. the tm_yyf <dig> and fm_yyf <dig> libraries did not form a cluster with two other replicates . to improve the repeatability between replicates at the three stages, the tm_yyf <dig> and fm_yyf <dig> libraries were eliminated and the pca analysis was repeated. this improved the repeatability between replicates and discrepancy between groups .

to confirm dge at the three floral transition stages , seven cdna libraries were constructed . based on these analyses, we identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated degs between vm and tm. similarly,  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated degs and  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated degs, respectively, were obtained from tm to fm and vm to fm. . the most degs were identified from vm to fm. a number of degs were not only specifically expressed between vm and tm, but between tm and fm or between vm and fm, while a large number of degs were phase-specific. there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs for vm versus tm, tm versus fm, and vm versus fm, respectively .fig.  <dig> numbers of differentially expressed genes in each comparison. a numbers of dges in each comparison; numbers on column show the quantity of upregulated  and downregulated  genes. b veen diagram analyses of differentially and stage-specific expression genes per comparison

go analysis of differentially expressed genes
up- and downregulated degs between vm and tm were subjected to an enrichment analysis for go annotation terms. in total,  <dig> degs were divided into three categories, cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. in the biological process category, the upregulated and downregulated degs were enriched for genes involved in metabolic processes, cellular processes, and single-organism processes. in the molecular function category, the upregulated and downregulated degs were mainly enriched for catalytic activity and binding. in the cellular component category, the upregulated degs were mainly associated with the cell, cell part, membrane, and macromolecular complex subcategories, while the downregulated degs were enriched for the cell, cell part, and macromolecular complex subcategories .fig.  <dig> the go classification of degs specifically expressed between vm and tm. the blue bar represents the percentage of up-regulated genes, while the red bar represents the percentage of down-regulated genes




kegg pathway enrichment analysis of degs
to characterize the expression profile of the  <dig>  degs, the expression data υ  were normalized to  <dig>  log2
, and log2
. in total,  <dig>  degs clustered into eight profiles based on an analysis using short times-series expression miner    <cit> . the degs between vm and tm were mainly associated with floral transition of the rose and genes that belonged to profiles  <dig> and  <dig> showed no significant difference from vm to tm stage. therefore, profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were chosen for subsequent analyses. profiles  <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated and contained  <dig> and  <dig> degs, respectively; profiles  <dig> and  <dig> were downregulated and contained  <dig> and  <dig> degs, while profiles  <dig> and  <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> degs, respectively .

all degs that belonged to profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were subjected to a kegg pathway enrichment analysis. the degs were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the top  <dig> pathways are shown in additional file  <dig>  partial kegg pathways associated with plant floral transition are listed in table  <dig>  three out of  <dig> unigenes in profile  <dig> ,  <dig> out of  <dig> unigenes  in profile  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig> unigenes  in profile  <dig> belonged to the circadian rhythm–plant pathway, while in profiles  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  no unigene belonged to this pathway. five our of  <dig> unigenes  in profile  <dig>  and  <dig> unigene accounting for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of genes, respectively, in profiles  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> belonged to the plant hormone signal transduction pathway, while no unigene in this pathway was detected in profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> out of  <dig> unigenes  in profile  <dig> belonged to the carbon metabolism pathway, and  <dig> out of  <dig> unigenes  in profile  <dig> belonged to the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway.table  <dig> partial kegg pathways associated with rose floral transition

in the autonomous pathway, fy and drm <dig> control the flowering time and activate flowering  <cit> , and were clustered in profile  <dig>  two degs belonging to profile  <dig> were annotated as frigida , which is expressed at low levels in the vm and fm stages, but is highly expressed in the tm stage. in addition, degs belonging to profile  <dig> and profile  <dig>  respectively, were annotated as mads and agl <dig>  which are also involved in rose floral transduction .

in the photoperiod pathway, two degs were annotated as constans, which is centrally involved in the relationship between day length and flowering  <cit> . they were assigned to profile  <dig>  and predominantly differed in the comparison between vm and tm. additionally, the circadian clock-controlled gene flavin-binding, kelch repeat, f-box  <dig>  was clustered in profile  <dig>  two dges annotated as chalcone synthase  were assigned to profile  <dig> and profile  <dig>  and were upregulated between vm and tm. in total,  <dig> out of the  <dig> degs that clustered into the photoperiod pathway showed upregulation from vm to tm and induced rose floral transition .

in the auxin signal transduction pathway, three degs were annotated as auxin-binding proteins , clustered to profile  <dig>  and showed upregulated expression patterns. three degs encoded auxin-induced protein , two of which belonged to profile  <dig> and one to profile 7; the expression level was relatively lower in the comparison between vm and tm . in addition, one deg was annotated as indole-3-acetic acid-induced protein  and clustered in profile  <dig> . only one deg was annotated as auxin response factor , which is dissociated by aux/iaa. degs in the auxin signal transduction pathway positively regulated the rose floral transduction.

in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway, only one deg belonging to profile  <dig> was annotated as gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase , which catalyzes the 2-beta-hydroxylation of gibberellin precursors, rendering them unable to be converted to active gas . in contrast, pyl <dig>  associated with the abscisic acid signal transduction pathway, belonged to profile  <dig> and showed a gradual decline during the floral transition process . in addition, two degs belonging to profile  <dig> and profile  <dig> were annotated as cyp707a, which affects aba levels.

in the sugar metabolism pathway, two degs belonging to profile  <dig> were annotated as sucrose synthase , and one deg was annotated as bidirectional sugar transporter , belonging to profile  <dig>  in addition, amy, which is associated with starch metabolism, was classified as belonging to profile  <dig> . these four degs showed similar patterns of upregulation between vm and tm, and positively regulated rose floral transduction .

confirmation of unigene expression using real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr
to verify the accuracy and reproducibility of the transcriptome analysis, gene-specific primers were designed for  <dig> degs . r. chinensis ‘old blush’ can flower year-round in favorable conditions ; accordingly, we obtained rna samples from the spring, summer, and autumn as templates, and validated the selected genes at the vm, tm, and fm stages. the expression profiles of the majority of candidate unigenes in the spring, summer, and autumn, based on rt-qpcr, were consistent with the rna-seq results . additionally, the expression patterns for col <dig> , elip , chs , bam <dig> , and gbss <dig>  based on rt-qpcr were consistent with the sequencing results. however, the expression levels revealed by rt-qpcr in the summer and autumn samples were inconsistent with the results obtained for spring samples using rna sequencing. in the autumn, col <dig>  elip, and chs were downregulated during the floral transition. similarly, gbss <dig> and bam <dig> were downregulated from vm to fm in the summer and autumn. overall, these candidate degs synergistically regulate the floral transition in the rose. based on these results, a hypothetical model for the regulatory networks involved in the rose floral transition in response to exogenous and endogenous cues was proposed, and is summarized in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> candidate unigene expression levels revealed via rt-qpcr  and rna-seq . data from rt-qpcr are means of three replicates and bars represent se, data from rna-seq are means of the replicates

discussion
flowering is a crucial developmental stage in the plant life cycle, especially for ornamental flowing plants. r. chinensis ‘old blush’ can flower continuously year-round, this trait is important for modern commercial roses and improves the yield and viewing time of modern roses. in this study, we investigated the complex molecular mechanisms underlying floral transition in r. chinensis ‘old blush’. characterizing the transcript profiles at these three developmental stages provides a basis for identifying candidate genes regulating the floral transition in the rose, which could improve our overall understanding of regulatory networks involved in perennials.

functional enrichment of degs
all degs were annotated using mapman software, and this analysis indicated that degs in the comparison between vm and tm were enriched for rna, hormone metabolism, signaling, and transport functions , indicating that plant hormone  signal transduction has a profound influence on the rose floral transition. in addition, genes in the major cho metabolism category, including sus <dig> and sus <dig> affecting the sucrose and starch metabolisms, were enriched in the comparison between vm and tm , but not in the other two comparisons. we observed greater enrichment for genes in the secondary metabolism category for the tm versus fm comparison than the vm and fm comparison . degs in the flavonoid subcategory were enriched between tm and fm, suggesting that shoots in the fm stage have been in the flower development period. there were less degs in the comparison between tm and fm than in the other two groups, indicating that the tm stage and the fm stage may involve integral processes . regarding the plant hormone signal transduction pathway, previous studies have verified that auxin, aba, and ga signaling genes are involved in the floral transition process in rose  <cit> . in the present study, we furthermore found that genes involved in biosynthesis and degradation of these hormones expressed differentially during floral transition .

sugar signaling regulates flowering transition in the rose
previous studies have demonstrated that sugars not only act as source of energy, but also as florigenic signals in plants  <cit> . however, limited information is available about the regulatory role of sugar in flowering transition in the rose. the fluctuating sugar and starch levels in sam may eventually be adjusted by alterations in the sugar flux or transitory starch to sugar  <cit> . in this study, gene expression patterns of sugar biosynthesis and transport were consistent with the content changes of sugars and starches during the floral transition process , implying that sugar may act as a florigenic signal, triggering the transition from vegetative to reproductive state; similar results were observed for other plants  <cit> . moreover, the increased levels of sugar during the floral transition also functioned as an osmotic pull for florigens, such as soc <dig>  ap <dig>  and fkf <dig>  previous studies have indicated that there is a close relationship between flowering transition and sugar transporters  <cit> . indeed, our results also showed that some flower integrators, i.e., co, col <dig>  soc <dig>  ap <dig>  and agl <dig>  are highly expressed in the flowering transition process, and similar patterns were observed for the expression of sugar transport-related genes and sugar contents. this suggests that sugar played a key role in inducing flowering by regulating the expression of flowering-related genes, such as soc <dig> and ap <dig> .

starch biosynthesis and metabolism participate in the floral transition and promote flowering. starch is the most important form of carbon reserve in plants. in particular, linear amylose is synthesized exclusively by gsbb <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the photoperiodic factor co regulates the expression of gbss <dig> and the composition of the starch granule  <cit> . our results showed that the starch content decreased gradually from vm to fm stage . however, starch biosynthesis genes, such as ss1- <dig>  gsss <dig>  thi <dig>  and sbpase, were upregulated from vm to tm, and were slowly downregulated from tm to fm , suggesting a higher transitory starch to sucrose ratio during the floral transition. admittedly, the two genes amy and bam <dig>  both participating in the starch degradation process, increased from vm to tm , indicating that abundant soluble sugar was necessary for the flowering transition. similar results were obtained in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, the results of rt-qpcr for summer and autumn revealed that the expression patterns of gbss <dig> and bam <dig> had no obvious changes during floral transition. this suggests a decrease of the speed of biosynthesis and metabolism of starch.

t6p signaling pathway is also involved in flower induction by regulating vegetative growth and the transition to flowering. t6p is viewed as a proxy for carbohydrate status in plants  <cit> . two genes, tps and tpp, involved in t6p biosynthesis and degradation process, were upregulated and downregulated, respectively , indicating that t6p was involved in the floral transition. several studies have also reported that t6p and akin <dig>  kinases play an opposite role in regulating the flowering transition in response to carbohydrate levels  <cit> . akin <dig> decreased gradually from vm to fm . several sbp transcription factors, such as spl <dig>  spl <dig>  spl <dig>  and spl <dig>  which were floral activators, are inhibited by mirna <dig>  however, t6p represses the expression of mirna <dig> and indirectly activate spls to promotes the transition to flowering  <cit> . t6p also directly promotes ft, regulating the flowering transition via the t6p pathway  <cit> . sugar signaling participates in the floral transition via multiple pathways. it will be interesting to study abnormal internal sugar levels in the rose to clarify these results.

hormone signaling mediates flowering transition in the rose
plant hormones, as components of the flowering time syndrome, have been studied in model plants  <cit> . however, the intricate hormone regulatory networks underlying the floral transition in perennial plants remain unclear. in this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles associated with hormone biosynthesis and signal regulatory pathways during floral transition process .

gas are important hormones involved in seed germination, floral induction, and development. previous studies have demonstrated that ga plays a positive role in mediating the floral transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . in contrast, ga negatively regulates the floral transition in woody plants, such as orange and apple  <cit> . however, a recent study showed that ga has dual, antagonistic roles in regulating the switch from vegetative to reproductive development. ga promotes the termination of vegetative development, but inhibits the floral transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, the levels of ga <dig>  ga <dig>  and ga <dig> decreased sharply from vm to tm , and ga biosynthesis genes, such as cps, ko, ga20ox <dig>  and ga3ox, were downregulated from vm to tm , while ga2ox, catalyzing bioactive gas to inactive forms, was upregulated from vm to tm. these changes eventually contributed to low levels of ga, thus indicating that ga played a negative role in mediating the floral transition in the rose. the della protein is a central node in ga signals, which interacted with spl3/ <dig> to induce ap <dig> and indirectly induce lfy, jointly inducing the floral transition  <cit> . our results showed that della proteins , spl <dig>  ap <dig> were all upregulated from vm to tm , indicating that della proteins play vital roles in inducing the onset of flowering transition. gamyb, a downstream component of ga response, binds to the promoter of lfy and enhances lfy expression; moreover, gamyb can also transactivate a barley α-amylase promoter  <cit> . in the current study, α-amylase was upregulated from vm to tm , suggesting that ga may interact directly with the starch metaolism or indirectly regulated the floral transition in the rose. it is worth mentioning, that naturally occurring ga <dig> is the most active ga during the floral induction process in a. thaliana  <cit> . however, the content of ga <dig> was much higher than ga <dig> and ga <dig> in the rose shoot apex, suggesting that the roles of gas in rose floral transition are different from their roles in a. thaliana.

the role of auxin during the floral transition has been widely studied in the model plant, but less is known about its function in woody plants. strawberry and rose belong to the same species, which can flower continuously. it has been reported that the spatial distribution of endogenous auxin and abp protein gradually concentrated in the sam during the floral transition process, indicating that auxin played a pivotal role in mediating the floral transition in the strawberry  <cit> . in the study, auxin contents and degs, yuc, and abp, were synchronously upregulated from vm to tm , while auxin-induced proteins, such as 5ng <dig> and saur, decreased , suggesting that auxin-related genes involved in the floral transition in the rose. similar observations have been reported in the seasonal rose r. wichurana  <cit> . the previous study demonstrated that auxin levels could be triggered by warm temperatures and elevated temperatures during the circadian clock window could promote flowering  <cit> , indicating that an intricate regulatory relationship exists among the circadian clock, temperature, and auxin pathways. further experiments are necessary to refine these relationships.

in the present study, aba contents in the sam of the rose were higher compared to other hormones, and decreased from vm to tm . the aba synthesis gene nced and its receptors, pyl and pyr, decreased during the floral transition process , suggesting that genes involved in aba signals may play an inhibitory role in the rose. however, cui et al.  <cit>  reported that aba could promote lcap <dig> and trigger the floral transition in litchi chinensis. snrk <dig> is involved in the sugar metabolism and also a key component of the aba signalling pathway, which functions as a positive regulator in aba signals  <cit> , indicating that sugar may interact with aba, consequently mediating floral transition. in addition, fca is an aba-binding protein, and the application of aba affects the ratio between the long and short splice forms of fca, and represses flowering  <cit> .

flowering pathway in the rose during floral transition
the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is a major physiological change in response to environmental  and internal cues  in a. thaliana  <cit> . fkf <dig> is a circadian clock-controlled gene, which activates co and interacts with gi  <cit> . in this study, fkf <dig> was downregulated from vm to tm, while co and col <dig> increased , indicating that photoperiod  positively mediated the rose floral transition.

vernalization, i.e., the acceleration of flowering by extended exposure to cold conditions, epigenetically silences flc via polycomb proteins, which deposit the repressive histone mark h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . however, since r. chinensis ‘old blush’ can flower continuously throughout a year, we inferred that the flowering transition of rose is not influenced by vernalization. in fact, flc does not express during floral transition in r. chinensis ‘old blush’ . interestingly, the key regulator, fri, which has been reported to activate the expression of flc in a. thaliana  <cit> , was upregulated from vm to tm . this difference requires further experiments to explore their potential functional diversification in regulating floral transition. additionally, several genes expression in ambient temperature conditions were also differentially expressed, including hsp <dig> and hsf, which were upregulated from vm to tm . a previous study demonstrated that plants induced to flower by temperature and photoperiod cues exhibit high hsp <dig> expression and gradual increases in temperature  <cit> . in the current study, hsp <dig> increased from vm to tm . the autonomous pathway is another important regulatory route including fca, fy, fpa, fld, ld, drm <dig> and so on, which function via a nonlinear hierarchy and generally promote flowering by repressing flc, independently of vernalization  <cit> . during floral transition, fy, fca, fpa, and drm <dig> were all downregulated from vm to tm, suggesting that autonomous pathway genes may promote flowering before the pre-floral stage.

the regulatory mechanism of flowering in the rose is complex, environmental and developmental factors converge towards a few floral integrator genes, such as soc <dig>  co, lfy, and ap <dig>  which irreversibly contributes to the transition from vm to fm. tfl <dig> is downregulated from vm to fm and upregulated from tm to fm, which is consistent with its inhibitory role in the floral transition at the earliest stage, and its regulation of the inflorescence meristem during floral development  <cit> . the circadian rhythm involved connected feed-back loops, including cca <dig>  lhy, gi, fkf <dig>  activated photoperiodic central gene, co, which promoted flowering by activating soc <dig>  subsequently, soc <dig> induced the expression of meristem identify regulators, i.e., lfy and ap <dig>  to initiate flowering transition. in this case, lfy exhibited highest expression at the first stage, suggesting that lfy expression increased quickly before flowering commences, as observed in arabidopsis  <cit> . a previous mapping study has already reported that the rose ortholog of the a. thaliana flowering time gene spy is in close proximity to the rb locus  <cit> . in the study, spy were upregulated during the flowering transition , suggesting that spy functions as a positive regulator for mediating flowering in the rose. clearly, additional experiments are necessary to validate these proposed roles. in addition, mir156-spl regulates flowering in a. thaliana by interacting with age-dependent or sugar budget pathways. furthermore, spl3/ <dig> promotes the floral transition by activating mads-box genes  <cit> . in the present study, several mads-box family  and spl family genes were jointly upregulated during the floral transition of the rose , suggesting that genes of the mads-box family play pivotal roles in the induction of the rose floral transition.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a comprehensive high-resolution characterization of gene expression profiles during the rose floral transition process. a number of degs were detected from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, and these belonged to circadian rhythm, autonomous, hormone, and sugar metabolism pathways. a molecular mechanism was proposed in which many pathways collectively regulated the floral transition in r. chinensis ‘old blush.’ these results provide a valuable resource for studies in other closely related species with similar agricultural and ornamental value.
