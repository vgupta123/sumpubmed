BACKGROUND
identification of genetic variants underlying phenotypic traits is one of the major tasks associated with contemporary cattle genomic research. the traditional genome-wide association studies  based on snp genotyping technology is likely to have reduced power in detecting causal variants because of incomplete linkage disequilibrium with the genotyped snps  <cit> . this inefficiency has been reduced considerably by the advent of whole-genome sequencing technology. the technology has also been predicted to be an efficient approach to evaluate complex traits  <cit> . it is necessary to sequence at deep coverage to enable efficient and reliable detection of genetic variants using whole-genome sequencing. sequencing at 15x coverage of the genome has been reported to enable identification of approx. 75 % of the genetic variants present in the heterozygote state  <cit> . an increase in sequence depth significantly improves both the accuracy and sensitivity of variant detection  <cit> . the accuracy of variant detection and detection rate is also dependent on the different variant detection algorithms  <cit> .

over the last few years, a number of bovine whole-genome sequencing studies have been carried out providing a substantial number of genetic variants in the form of single nucleotide polymorphism  and insertion/deletion . these variants are catalogued in dbsnp  <cit>  with input from the bovine hapmap project  <cit> , the bovine genome project  <cit>  and other whole genome sequencing studies on diverse cattle breeds . most recently, the  <dig> bull genomes project has reported whole-genome sequencing of  <dig> bulls, leading to detection of  <dig>  million snps and  <dig>  million indels  <cit> . however, genome sequencing studies for mining genetic variants are still ongoing and a large fraction of genetic variants in different cattle breeds remains to be discovered and properly annotated.

genetic variants detected using whole-genome sequencing has been used successfully to identify causal variants and to map complex traits in domestic cattle  <cit> . in human, the causal role of loss-of-function  variants  in severe mendelian diseases is well established. recently, charlier et al.  <cit>  showed that lof variants at the homozygous state can compromise fertility in cattle by causing embryonic lethality  <cit> . therefore, screening a comprehensive list of deleterious lof variants detected by deep sequencing would be of considerable interest in cattle genomic studies targeting fertility and production traits.

in this study, we describe the results of whole-genome sequencing  of four unrelated  danish holstein-friesian cows. multi-sample variant calling facilitated the detection of  <dig>  million variants. the concordance of sequencing derived snps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % compared with the high-density chip data. we then generated a catalog of filtered lof variants that will provide a resource for future functional studies on economically important traits thereby contributing to the contemporary cattle genomics research.

RESULTS
sequencing and mapping
sequencing generated  <dig> , <dig>  reads of 100 bp for four holstein cow genomes. reads were mapped to the bos taurus reference assembly umd  <dig>   <cit>  using the burrows-wheeler aligner   <cit> . the percentage of mapped reads ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % with a mean of  <dig>  % resulting in  <dig>  gb of data . the mean depth of coverage was 27x , which was in the same range as other deep re-sequencing studies  <cit> . per chromosome coverage by at least one sequencing read  yielded average genome coverage of  <dig>  % . the higher percentage of genome coverage compared with previous studies  <cit>  could be explained by an increase in read lengths  <cit>  as longer reads  were utilized in this study.table  <dig> summary of the alignment statistics for four holstein cows genome



snp and indel detection
multi-sample variant calling using the unifiedgenotyper from the genome analysis toolkit   <cit>  identified  <dig> , <dig> snps of which 53 % were heterozygous.  <dig>  snps  were novel and  <dig> , <dig> snps  were known compared with dbsnp  . most of the snps  were biallelic while the remaining  <dig>  % was triallelic. the genome-wide mean transition to transversion ratio was  <dig> , which is in agreement with previous holstein genome re-sequencing studies  <cit> . the snp density across the genome  showed a uniform chromosomal distribution of snps in line with the findings by kawahara-miki et al.  <cit> . multi-sample indel calling using unifiedgenotyper from gatk  <cit>  resulted in the identification of  <dig> , <dig> indels  of which  <dig>   were novel while the remaining are previously described in dbsnp .  <dig>  % of the indels represent deletions while the remaining  <dig>   were insertions . in order to reduce the risk of eliminating true genetic variants present at a low frequency, we used a less stringent filtering approach resulting in the number of detected snps per animal  being higher than detected in previous studies on holstein cattle  <cit> . the use of different variant detection algorithms could also influence the number of snps discovered  <cit> . however, the number of detected snps within an individual was lower in this study than in a previous study in the old danish jutland breed using the same algorithm and filtering parameters  <cit> . this lower level of genetic variation could be an effect of the long period of artificial selection with a low effective population size in the danish holstein breed  <cit> .table  <dig> summary statistics of the identified variants

evaluation of variant calling
samples used for sequencing were also genotyped using the bovinehd beadchip  to evaluate the accuracy of snp detection and genotype calling from sequencing data. mitochondrial snps and snps with ambiguous chromosomal positions on the umd  <dig>  assembly  <cit>  were filtered from the array calls. snp genotypes retained on  <dig> autosomes and chromosome x  were compared to the sequencing derived snps.  <dig> – <dig>  % of the homozygous alternative snp calls in the bovinehd beadchip were identified in our sequencing calls. the rate of genotype concordance was  <dig> – <dig>  % . the detection rate was  <dig> – <dig>  % for the heterozygous snps and the rate of concordant calls was  <dig> – <dig>  % . the discordant snps were classified into different categories: 1) homozygous snps over-called as heterozygous due to sequence errors in the reads or erroneously mapped reads; 2) heterozygous snps under-called as homozygous due to insufficient sequencing depth; 3) snps called as homozygous both on the bovinehd beadchip and in the sequencing call but with different alleles were designated as inconsistent calls and could be a result of ambiguous mapping of reads or sequence errors in the reads. we observed a very low rate at which homozygous snps over-called as heterozygous , heterozygous snps under-called as homozygous  and of inconsistent calls  . a comparison with the results of a previous report by zhan et al.  <cit>  revealed that we had a lower rate of inconsistent calls in our results maybe as a consequence of higher sequencing depth and use of a different snp calling algorithm.table  <dig> comparison of bovinehd chip homozygous alternative genotypes to sequencing calls

concordant, the same alleles at the same sites were detected by both the bovinehd chip and sequencing calls; inconsistent, homozygous calls by both the bovine hd chip and sequencing calls but with different alleles; homozygous > heterozygous, homozygous snps on the bovinehd chip that were over-called as heterozygous in sequencing calls

concordant, the same alleles at the same sites were detected by both the bovinehd chip and sequencing calls; heterozygous > homozygous, heterozygous snps on the bovinehd chip that were under-called as homozygous in sequencing calls



to validate the indel calls, pcr primers and probes were designed for  <dig> indels. pcr products were used to genotype  <dig> danish holstein breeding bulls. genotyping was performed by size determination on a 3730xl dna analyzer and the data was analyzed using genemapper v. <dig>  . of the  <dig> indels genotyped,  <dig> indels were found to be true indels.

functional annotation of variants
annotation using ngs-snp  <cit>  assigned a range of functional classes to the variants identified . most of the variants were located in intergenic regions. intronic variants represent the majority of the variants located in genic regions whereas the regions 5 kb upstream and downstream of a transcript exhibited a total of  <dig>  variants.  <dig>  variants were located in the 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions. the number of variants identified in splice sites included  <dig> splice donor and  <dig> splice acceptor site variants. in addition,  <dig> variants causing a change within the region of the splice site  were found. in total,  <dig>  snps were predicted to affect the coding sequences:  <dig> snps were predicted to cause a premature stop codon,  <dig> to destroy a termination codon, and  <dig>   to cause non-synonymous substitutions . the remaining  <dig>  snps in the coding sequences were predicted to have either synonymous or indeterminate effects. in total  <dig> indels were identified in coding sequences:  <dig> indels predicted to cause a disruption of the translational reading frame,  <dig> indels predicted to cause inframe insertions,  <dig> to cause inframe deletions,  <dig> to create amino acid changes in the encoded protein without changing the frame, one to destroy the initiation codon and  <dig> to have an indeterminate effect. we observed that indels in coding sequences were enriched for lengths that are a multiple of three   suggesting a purifying selection against frame-shift in coding sequences as has been observed by daetwyler et al.  <cit> . considering snps and indels jointly  <dig> variants were identified in non-coding genes:  <dig> in non-coding exons,  <dig> in mature mirnas and  <dig> in non-coding rnas. annotation revealed that the proportion of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, splice site and frameshift variants was lower in danish holstein than in the japanese kuchinoshima-ushi  <cit>  and korean hanwoo breeds  <cit>  in agreement with the previous studies on these two breeds.table  <dig> annotation of variants by functional class

lof variants in protein-coding genes
we identified  <dig> lof variants in  <dig> protein-coding genes in total including  <dig> stop gains in  <dig> genes,  <dig> splice site variants  in  <dig> genes and  <dig> frame-shift indel variants in  <dig> genes . there were  <dig> genes harboring more than one lof variant. of these  <dig> lof variants,  <dig> were heterozygous at least in one of the sequenced animals while the remaining  <dig> variants were homozygous in all four sequenced animals. these homozygous variants in all four animals might be breed specific variation, or it might be due to errors in the reference sequence. in total  <dig>  of the lof variants were not present in dbsnp build  <dig>  investigation on the distribution and densities of these lof variants show the highest density on bta  <dig> , particularly in genes spanning the 57–64 mb region including aldehyde dehydrogenase family  <dig> member a <dig>  and uncharacterized proteins . a comparison with annotated variants in the danish jutland breed  <cit>  revealed a similar rate of lof variants in this region. however, tandem duplications  and inversions  identified in this region  suggest that the higher densities of lof might be influenced by structural variants.table  <dig> numbers of lof variants before filtering and putative deleterious lof variants after filtering

gene ontology  enrichment analysis using the panther version  <dig>   <cit>  revealed that genes related to “olfactory receptor activity”, “detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell”, “sensory perception of smell”, “detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception”, “detection of stimulus involved in sensory perception” and “detection of chemical stimulus” were overrepresented in lof affected genes . overrepresentation of these go terms could be explained by the enrichment of olfactory receptor genes in the group of lof affected genes. olfactory receptor genes form the largest multigene family in mammals   <cit>  making it probable that the occurrence of numerous copies of specific domains creates problems in mapping of short sequences resulting in erroneous identification of genetic variation within these related genes. the go terms “g-protein coupled receptor activity”, “transmembrane signaling receptor activity”, “neurological system process”, “signaling receptor activity”, and “g-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway” were also overrepresented in lof affected genes. g-protein coupled receptors  are known to be associated with neurotransmission, transmembrane receptor activity and signaling pathways  <cit> . gpcrs are the largest family of membrane proteins encompassing ~2 % of the human proteins  <cit> . at present, the number of gpcr protein domains listed in the ensembl database for human and cow are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the loss of a gpcr might be deleterious to a particular function in which it is involved, however it has no apparent effect in other cases  <cit> . these observations support a lof tolerance for specific members of gpcrs explaining the overrepresentation of gpcrs within the group of lof affected genes in this study. a similar enrichment for lof containing genes implicating olfactory reception and gpcr receptor activity were also observed in the human data published by macarthur et al.  <cit> . in contrast, genes related to go terms “membrane-bounded organelle”, “cytoplasm”, “intracellular part”, “organelle”, “intracellular membrane-bounded organelle”, “intracellular organelle”, “ cytoplasmic part” and “ cell ” were significantly  underrepresented in the set of lof affected genes . these go terms cover almost all important constituent parts of a cell  <cit> . eukaryotic nuclear organization plays important roles in the coordination of transcription with subsequent processes involved in gene expression  <cit> , whereas ribosomal biogenesis provide the framework in the eukaryotic translation mechanism  <cit> . proper cooperation between the plasma membrane, the nucleus and other organelles such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum is crucial for many cellular processes including synthesis and intracellular transport, intracellular homeostasis, controlling fundamental processes like motility and contraction, secretion, cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . moreover, mutational disruption of genes related to nuclear protein  <cit> , ribosomal biogenesis  <cit> , mitochondrial dna  <cit> , endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , golgi apparatus  <cit>  and plasma membrane  <cit>  are associated with recessively inherited disorders in mammals. taken together these observations support a possible selection against the occurrence of lof variants in genes related to the nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, the golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. lof affected genes were also depleted for the go terms “positive regulation of cellular process”, “cellular metabolic process”, “protein binding” and “positive regulation of biological process”. previous studies have shown that loss of the function of genes related to these annotations are associated with inherited diseases in mammals . these observations make it probable that selection against lof mutations within these genes explains the reduced occurrence of lof within these genes in our study. a significant depletion for genes related to “protein binding”, “intracellular membrane-bounded organelle”, cytoplasmic part”, “intracellular organelle part” and “nuclear part” was also reported by macarthur et al.  <cit> . there were overlaps for lof containing genes such as olfactory receptor, family  <dig>  subfamily n, member  <dig>  and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate o-acyltransferase  <dig>  between our data and the data from macarthur et al.  <cit> . the two data sets also included closely related gene family members  for instance, atp-binding cassette, sub-family a , member  <dig> and  <dig> ; kallikrein-related peptidase  <dig> and  <dig> ; tigger transposable element derived  <dig> and  <dig> ; uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase  <dig>  poly peptide b <dig> and  <dig> ; and zinc finger protein  <dig> and  <dig> . these observations give an indication that a similar lof tolerance exists for members of these gene families implicating the potential for rescuing lof mutations by other genes within the gene family both in cattle and human.

recent studies reported an increased rate of false-positive calls among lof variants  <cit> ; therefore it is necessary to test the accuracy of their identification. to test the false-positive rate of our lof variants,  <dig> snps  and  <dig> frame-shift indels were selected for genotyping. a group of  <dig> danish holstein breeding bulls in addition to the four sequenced cows was genotyped for the selected variants. snp genotyping using custom taqman snp genotyping assays and indels genotyped by size determination of pcr products revealed four  variants were false positive, while two assays did not produce pcr products . this finding suggests that the lof variants list will require more filtering and experimental validation  to generate a high-confidence data set.

heterozygous lof variants segregating in the absence of homozygotes in a population could be imagined to encompass deleterious variants including causal variants for embryonic/fetal death. we got access to the data on genotypic variation from whole-genome resequencing data of  <dig> holstein animals from the  <dig> bull genomes project after completion of run four of this project  <cit> . these animals are expected to represent a major fraction of the genetic diversity in the global holstein population. accessibility to such a large data set allowed us to perform a filtering based on the absence of homozygotes for the variant allele of the identified lof variants. filtering retained  <dig> variants  as putative deleterious from our list of lof variants . information on these  <dig> putative deleterious lof variants is presented in additional file  <dig>  enrichment of go terms related to olfactory reception remains significant for the genes in the list of putative deleterious lof variants . however, go terms related to gpcrs were not significantly enriched in this list in contrast to the complete list of  <dig> lof variants suggesting that lof mutations in gpcrs either are tolerated or can be rescued by gene products from other genes within this gene family. go terms related to key cellular constituents and cellular and biological process regulation remain significantly depleted for genes affected by putative deleterious variants emphasizing that genes associated with these go terms are less likely to tolerate lof mutations.

we then tested the  <dig> filtered lof variants for concordance of the class of genetic variants called in both the  <dig> bull genome and our data set and found that  <dig> variants were concordantly called. however,  <dig> positions had an inconsistent call between the two data sets; particularly  <dig> were called as indels in our data but were called as a snp in the  <dig> bulls data . these inconsistent calls might be attributable to differences in the variant detection algorithm  <cit>  as we used unifiedgenotyper from gatk  <cit>  whereas the  <dig> bull genomes project used mpileup from samtools  <cit> . of the  <dig>  inconsistent calls,  <dig> were annotated as indels in dbsnp build  <dig>  but as these indels might have been detected using the same algorithm as used in our study this is not necessarily corroborating our interpretation. we, therefore, tested  <dig> inconsistent calls by sequencing pcr products  to validate the nature of the genetic variant. of the  <dig> tested variants,  <dig> were found to be indels whereas none was confirmed as a snp. four inconsistent calls were confirmed as false positive that could be a result of ambiguous mapping of reads. taken together these results suggest that gatk is providing more accurate calls than samtools, which is consistent with observations from previous studies  <cit> . unifiedgenotyper from gatk has also been found to be an accurate variant caller in identification and validation of lof variants in clinical contexts  <cit> .

the minor allele frequency  distribution of the  <dig> concordantly called lof variants  using the  <dig> bull genome data set show that maf is > <dig>  for more than 60 % of the stop-gain snps and splice site variants while less than 40 % of the frame-shift indels show a maf > <dig> . it was recently demonstrated that balancing selection allows a variant that is lethal in homozygotes to persist in the population at a relatively high frequency  <cit> , thus variants with minor allele frequency > <dig>  could be of considerable interest for further studies to mine causative mutations for recessive traits/disorders.fig.  <dig> minor allele frequency distribution for putative deleterious lof variants called by both gatk and samtools. minor allele frequency was calculated using data for the  <dig> holstein animals from the  <dig> bull genomes project



the list of putative deleterious lof variants can be used to mine candidate regions from association studies for potential deleterious candidate variants. however, the candidates from the list should be validated experimentally by sanger resequencing to confirm the actual presence of the variant and the gene models used for predicting the annotation should be investigated to confirm the annotation. likewise, gene expression studies should be conducted to validate the consequences of the splice site variants. the list of putative deleterious lof variants will despite the necessity of experimental validation be valuable information for future studies on detecting causal variants for recessive lethal or deleterious phenotypes in holstein cattle also because of the similarity with results in human  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the re-sequencing of four danish holstein cow genomes with a mean depth of 27x coverage followed by multi-sample variant calling identified a total of  <dig>  million variants. the snp detection rate and genotype concordance compared with high density chip data indicate high-confidence of the snp calls. functional annotation of identified snps showed that the proportion of non-synonymous substitutions was lower than those identified in genetically distant cattle breeds. a comparison of the results obtained in this study with the results from our previous study  <cit>  using the same variant detection algorithm and filtering parameters revealed a reduced number of genetic variants segregating in danish holsteins compared to the old danish jutland cattle. the reduction in genetic variation is probably a consequence of the increased inbreeding level caused by the high selection imposed on danish holstein  <cit> .

an investigation into lof variants revealed the highest density of putative deleterious lof variants on bta <dig>  particularly in genes within the region spanning 57–64 mb. this higher density might be associated with structural variants segregating in this region. genes affected by putative deleterious lof were strongly enriched for functional categories related to olfactory reception and depleted for genes related to key cellular constituents, cellular and biological process regulation. a comparison between our data and data from macarthur et al.  <cit>  provided an indication that a similar lof tolerance pattern exists for genes both in cattle and human. filtering using data for  <dig> animals from the  <dig> bull genomes project revealed  <dig> lof variants where none of the sequenced animals was homozygous.  <dig> of them were concordantly called between the two data sets . we observed  <dig> inconsistent calls  between our filtered data set and the  <dig> bull genomes data, which could be a consequence of the use of different variant calling algorithms . sequencing pcr products for  <dig> inconsistent calls revealed that gatk provided more accurate calls than samtools. more than 60 % of the concordantly called lof snps while less than 40 % of the frame-shift indels were observed to have a minor allele frequency > <dig>  in the  <dig> bull genomes data set. in future studies, it will be worthwhile to examine whether any one of these identified lof variants is compromising fertility by recessive embryonic/prenatal lethality in the global holstein population.
