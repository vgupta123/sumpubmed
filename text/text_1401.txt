BACKGROUND
numerous plant developmental processes, such as germination, cell elongation, photomorphogenic responses, and male fertility are regulated by the plant-specific steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids . br-biosynthetic or br-perceiving mutants have exhibited defective growth patterns in various tissues that persist throughout their entire life span, indicating the critical role of br in plant development  <cit> . although studies researching the br signaling process began much more recently than any of the other plant hormones, the identification of brassinosteroid-insensitive <dig> , a receptor of br  <cit> , and several other important components involved in br signaling have provided much insight into many important components in plant development  <cit> . plasma membrane-localized bri <dig> and its co-receptor bri1-associated kinase <dig>  are receptor-like serine/threonine kinases containing leucine-rich repeats   <cit> . n-terminal lrrs are found in the extracellular portion of the plasma membrane. bri <dig> constitutively forms a homodimer in the plasma membrane. in the absence of br, the activity of the bri <dig> homodimer is inhibited by the bri <dig> kinase inhibitor  <dig>  by binding bki <dig> to the c-terminal portion of bri <dig>  in the presence of br, bki <dig> is released by the direct binding of br to the 70-amino acid island region in the extracellular domain of bri <dig>  <cit> . then, bri <dig> recruits bak <dig>  forming heterodimerized-receptor complexes in the plasma membrane  <cit> , leading to the activation of the bes <dig> and bzr <dig> transcription factors that regulate the expression of the br-associated genes  <cit> .

bri <dig> is considered to be a master regulator that plays a critical role in the direct binding of br and subsequent br signaling processes  <cit> , while bak <dig> has been found to be a partner not only for bri <dig> but also for other lrr-rlks, such as fls <dig> and efrs, which are involved in the plant innate immunity responses  <cit> . to date, genetic screening looking for br-insensitive mutants has resulted in the identification of only two genes, bri <dig> and bin <dig>  <cit> . since the first report of bri <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> , more than  <dig> different mutant alleles have been identified in several different arabidopsis ecotypes, including col- <dig>  ws- <dig>  and en- <dig> during last two decades. large numbers of mutant alleles that have mutations in various positions of a specific gene provide information regarding how that gene acts, because the mutation sites themselves are indicators of their importance to the functioning of the gene. in that sense, studying multiple mutant alleles of bri <dig> will be likely to reveal important information regarding its function. detailed analyses of the characteristics of each mutation have shown that both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of bri <dig> are required for full bri <dig> functioning, because the mutation sites of all of the bri <dig> mutant alleles are dispersed in both an extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain  <cit> .

the extracellular domain of bri <dig> consists of lrrs and a 70-amino acid island containing unique sequences that show little homology to any other protein. since bri <dig> was discovered, it has been considered to have  <dig> lrrs with a 70-amino acid island flanking the 21st and 22nd lrr. however, vert et al,   <cit>  suggested that bri <dig> contains  <dig> lrrs, postulating that the 21st lrr is actually an atypical formation. it appears evident that the region near the 70-amino acid island allows for the extracellular binding of br. it is interesting to note that most of the mutation sites in the extracellular domain of bri <dig> are clustered in the 70-amino acid island domain and in the  <dig> lrrs situated before the transmembrane domain. there are very few examples of mutant alleles containing defects in the lrr regions that occur before the 70-amino acid island. this may be partially because the mutations in these lrr regions of bri <dig> were neglected due to the lack of any discernible phenotypic alterations. or, at the opposite extreme, they may lethally affect plant development, resulting in no viable mutants for further analyses. here, we report a new mutant allele of bri <dig>  bri1- <dig>  a point mutation in the region encoding the 13th lrr of bri <dig> in bri1- <dig> caused the defective growth and reduced br sensitivity of the plant. using this mutant allele, we demonstrated successful interallelic complementation using a kinase-inactive mutant allele, bri1- <dig> and performed a detailed analysis of br sensitivity.

RESULTS
phenotypic analyses of the weak bri1-looking semi-dwarf mutant, cp3
to find natural mutants that show altered growth patterns compared to their corresponding wild type plants, we searched for and obtained mutant seed stocks from the arabidopsis biological resource center . we grew several putative seeds and selected the cp <dig> mutant  for further analysis, because compared to the corresponding wild type plant landsberg , the phenotypic features of the mutant, including the downward curling, dark-green compact rosette leaves, and reduced growth gave the appearance of a weak bri <dig> mutant, bri1- <dig> . the cp <dig> mutant exhibited reduced growth in all aspects except leaf width , resulting in a semi-dwarf stature with round and compact rosette leaves. to determine the br sensitivity of the cp <dig> mutant, we applied  <dig> μm of brassinolide , the most bioactive br, to the mutant plants on the region where the plants were exhibiting growth. compared with the wild type ler, which showed elongated petioles and leaves and faded green colored leaves upon overnight br exposure, the leaves and petioles of the mutant plants were much less elongated and displayed still green-colored leaves, indicating reduced sensitivity to br . to confirm this, we analyzed the transcriptional inhibition of the cpd expression pattern in cp <dig> mutants with and without exogenous bl treatment, using the known weak bri <dig> mutant, bri1- <dig>  as a control . as observed with bri1- <dig>  the cp <dig> mutant contained higher levels of cpd transcripts compared to the wild type ler in the presence of bl, indicating that the cp <dig> mutant possesses reduced-bl sensitivity. we also performed a root growth inhibition assay using the plants grown on the media containing bl . both the columbia  and ler wild type plants showed more than 50% reductions in root growth in the presence of  <dig> nm bl. in contrast, the cp <dig> mutants showed  <dig> to 40% reductions in root growth after treatment with the same concentration of bl. in comparison, bri1- <dig> displayed almost no sensitivity to bl in terms of root inhibition. these results indicate that the bl sensitivity of cp <dig> is reduced compared to the wild type, although the degree of reduction is less than that of bri1- <dig>  we further assessed the response of cp <dig> to other plant hormones. similar degrees of root growth inhibition were observed in ler and cp <dig> when the plants were treated with a variety of hormones with the exception of bl , indicating that the cp <dig> mutant specifically has a reduced sensitivity to bl, but not to any other plant hormones.

identification of the weak bri <dig> mutant allele, bri1-120
based on the morphological phenotypes and reduced bl sensitivity of the cp <dig> mutant, we thought that cp <dig> may be one of the bri <dig> mutant alleles. thus, we sequenced the genomic dna spanning the bri <dig> region in the cp <dig> mutant. we also sequenced the same region of ler as a control. since the arabidopsis whole genome sequences are derived from the col- <dig> ecotype, we found one mismatched nucleotide in the  <dig> th position from the open reading frame of the bri <dig> sequence between ler and col- <dig>  this nucleotide change causes an alteration from arginine to glycine in the 1171st amino acid of bri <dig>  more importantly, we found an additional mismatched nucleotide at the 1196th position from the open reading frame with a t to c change, resulting in a change from serine to phenylalanine at the 399th amino acid position of bri <dig> in the cp <dig> mutant . the wild type ler has a nucleotide t in the 1196th position as in col- <dig>  therefore, we reasoned that the nucleotide change at the 3512th position of bri <dig> in ler is a natural polymorphism due to an ecotype difference between ler and col- <dig>  and that the nucleotide change at the 1196th position of bri <dig> in the cp <dig> mutant compared to ler causes its phenotypic changes.

to verify this notion, we generated a transgenic cp <dig> plant overexpressing bri <dig> by introducing a bri <dig> promoter-driven bri1:bri1-gfp construct. the growth of the bri1-overexpressing cp <dig> plants was more similar to that of the wild type as compared to the non-transformed cp <dig> plants . we confirmed that the bri1-gfp transgene was highly expressed in the transgenic cp <dig> plants by rt-pcr analyses using primers that amplified transgene specifically . the cp <dig> plants overexpressing bri1-gfp showed nearly normal overall growth patterns with elongated leaves and petiole length as well as total height, similar to those observed with ler . in addition, the cp <dig> transgenic plants overexpressing bri <dig> showed restored bl sensitivity, exhibiting a bl-induced transcriptional inhibition of cpd expression . these results suggest that the growth retardation of the cp <dig> mutant accompanied by the dark green coloring is caused by a mutation in the extracellular domain of bri <dig>  therefore, we renamed the cp <dig> mutant bri1- <dig>  referring to the order of naming for bri <dig> mutant alleles  <cit> 

bri <dig> protein is localized in plasma membrane and the overexpression of bri <dig> in bri1- <dig> resulted in the leaf elongation of bri1- <dig> and co-suppression of the endogenous bri1-301
we introduced nucleotide c instead of t at the 1196th position of br <dig> by site-directed mutagenesis to generate the bri1- <dig> mutated bri <dig>  using the bri1-gfp construct as a template. the resulting construct  was transformed into the wild type col- <dig>  bri1- <dig> plants to produce a mutated bri <dig>  after the wild type plant was transformed with bri1:bri1-120-gfp, we first observed the intracellular localization of the bri <dig> protein using a confocal microscope by detecting the gfp that was fused with bri <dig> in the plasma membrane of the cells , which indicated that bri1- <dig> possesses the plasma membrane-localized bl receptor, although bri <dig> may not be fully functional protein. in comparison, the mutated bri <dig> proteins, bri <dig> in bri1- <dig> and bri <dig> in bri1- <dig>  in which both mutations are in the extracellular domain of bri <dig>  are known to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> .

we also produced transgenic bri1- <dig> overexpressing mutated bri <dig> to examine whether the additional bri <dig> proteins are able to rescue the bri1- <dig> mutant phenotypes or not, although the transgenic plants have two mutated forms of bri <dig> derived from the bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> mutations, respectively. from this analysis, we found that all of the transgenic bri1- <dig> displayed phenotypes that were wild type in appearance, with less compact rosette leaves due to elongated petioles and leaves, even in the t <dig> generation. in subsequent generations, a phenotypic recovery of bri1- <dig> achieved by the overexpression of bri1:bri1-120-gfp was observed in most of the plants. however, some plants showed only a partial recovery of the bri1- <dig> phenotype, and a few plants displayed stronger mutant phenotypes compared to the non-transformed bri1- <dig> . and these phenotypic differences still remained in inflorescent adult stage . we attributed the phenotypic differences of the transgenic bri1- <dig> overexpressing bri1:bri1-120-gfp to the co-suppression of bri <dig> gene. the bri <dig> transcripts derived from the endogenous bri <dig> and the transgene were shown to be inversely correlated with phenotypic severity by rt-pcr analyses using primers that amplified each gene specifically . co-suppression was first shown in petunia, in which the transgene, chalcone-synthase a, caused transcript loss due to the degradation of the homologous endogenous gene  <cit> . since then, it has been regarded as eukaryotic post-transcriptional gene silencing. we also performed a western blot analysis of the total proteins from the plants showing representative phenotypes using the anti-gfp antibodies and anti-bri <dig> antibodies. as shown in figure 4c in the bottom panel, all the transgenic plants produced mutated bri <dig> protein fused to gfp detected by anti-gfp antibodies, although the protein expression level is higher in the transgenic bri1- <dig> plant that was wild type in appearance. when we used anti-bri <dig> antibodies that can detect both endogenous and transgene-derived bri <dig> proteins, the same plant contained more bri <dig> proteins. in contrast, much less bri <dig> proteins were detected in the strong bri <dig> mutant-looking bri1- <dig> transgenic plant compared to the untransformed bri1- <dig>  we also detected bri <dig> mutant-looking phenotypic alterations that were due to co-suppression in the wild type plant overexpressing bri1:bri1-120-gfp .

bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> complemented each other to form a functional bri <dig> receptor
based on the results above, we questioned whether an increased number of bri <dig> proteins, although it is partially functional, is enough to mediate br signaling with heterodimers consisting of mutated proteins, and if the heterodimerization between the bri proteins containing an extracellular lrr domain mutation in bri1- <dig> and the bri <dig> proteins with a cytoplasmic kinase domain mutation in bri1- <dig>  reconstituted a fully functional bri <dig> in the cells. to address these questions, we crossed bri1- <dig> with bri1- <dig>  we expected that all of the f <dig> plants from this cross would exhibit semi-dwarf looking phenotypes, similar to both parental plants. however, when we analyzed  <dig> individual plants from the f <dig> generation, we found that the phenotypic segregation deviated slightly from the expected one. thus, we grew and genotyped all of the plants using caps and dcaps primers specific for the bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> mutations, respectively. more attention was directed toward the plants that were heterozygous both mutations in each homologous chromosome of the cell: the bri1- <dig> mutation residing on one homologous chromosome and the bri1- <dig> mutation on the other. among these plants, approximately half showed compact rosettes and semi-dwarf statures similar to the parental mutant phenotypes, and the remaining half displayed rescued bri1- <dig> phenotypes in terms of overall rosette morphologies . because there are no additional bri <dig> proteins added by the transgene in these crossed plants, it is suggested that the rescued bri1- <dig> phenotype resulted from the interallelic complementation that occurred between the bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> mutated alleles.

different bl sensitivity was observed in the bri1- <dig> transformed with bri1:bri1-120-gfp and the bri1- <dig> crossed with bri1-120
the results above indicate that both the overexpression of bri1- <dig> by transformation and the reconstitution of functional bri <dig> by crossing it with bri1- <dig> restored the mutant phenotype of bri1- <dig>  we also wanted to know whether br sensitivity returns to normal in these plants. we examined root growth inhibition in the transgenic bri1- <dig> transformed with bri1:bri1-120-gfp in the presence or absence of bl. compared with the un-transformed bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> control plants, the root length of the transgenic bri1- <dig> plant in the absence of bl was shorter than that of non-transformed bri1- <dig>  similar to that of bri1- <dig>  moreover, the root growth inhibition pattern exhibited after the bl treatment of the transgenic bri1- <dig> plant was similar to that of bri1- <dig> . the rescue of the transcriptional inhibition of cpd expression in the transgenic bri1- <dig> by the overexpression of bri1:bri1-120-gfp was not as dramatic as that observed in the wild type, either . in comparison, the root lengths of the wild type-looking f <dig> plants crossed with bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> were more similar to the root length of the wild type. also, the degree of inhibition of root growth showed similar patterns compared to the wild type . the transcript level of cpd was reduced in response to bl to the same degree as seen in the wild type . taken together, these results suggest that the f <dig> plants crossed with bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> were similar to the wild type plant not only morphologically but also in terms of their cellular responsiveness to bl, leading to the strong assumption that these f <dig> plants contain a functional bri <dig> .these results suggest that the elongated rosette phenotype that has been frequently considered to be the br sensitivity gauge may not be coupled with other assessment of br sensitivity, such as root growth inhibition or cpd expression in response to bl.

discussions
bri1- <dig> revealed the importance of the lrr region in the extracellular domain of bri1
the degree of phenotypic alteration caused by each bri <dig> allele depends on the specific affected mutation sites  <cit> . mutants that have amino acid changes in the cytoplasmic kinase domain usually show very strong mutant phenotypes, which can be attributed to loss of bri <dig> kinase activity. bri1- <dig> is an exceptional case. although bri1- <dig> was shown to be a kinase-inactive protein, the mutant plant exhibits only mild phenotypic changes. bri1- <dig> contains two nucleotide changes  in the cytoplasmic kinase domain of bri <dig>  resulting in a change from gly <dig> to ile  <cit> . however, gly <dig> is not a conserved amino acid, and its position is slightly out of the critical region of the kinase domain. so, it is possible that gly <dig> is important for maintaining the proper conformation of the bri <dig> protein to retain its kinase activity, but, not for controlling the kinase activity itself.

in comparison, most of the mutations in the extracellular domain of bri <dig> produced relatively mild mutant phenotypes. a more thorough examination of the extracellular domain of bri <dig> revealed that the 70-amino acid island domain and the subsequent four lrrs before the transmembrane domain are frequent mutation sites, indicating their functional importance to the bri <dig> protein. in addition, the first cysteine pair before the beginning of the lrrs is thought to be critical for bri <dig> as seen in the mutant bri1- <dig> . so far bri1- <dig> is the only mutant in which the mutation occurred in the lrr regions preceding the 70-amino acid island domain  <cit> . however, a 10-bp deletion in the 3rd lrr of bri <dig> in bri1- <dig> introduced a premature stop in translation and did not provide any clues regarding the functional importance of the lrr domains of bri <dig> 

in this study, we analyzed the br-related phenotypes of cp <dig> grown from the cs <dig> seeds obtained from abrc to have more natural mutants with similar morphologies to known bri <dig> mutants, although the phenotypic strength of bri1- <dig> is relatively weak compared to other bri <dig> mutants, such as bri1- <dig> or bri1- <dig>  cp <dig> has the compacta <dig>  mutation, and cp <dig> mutants show altered phytochrome a signaling  <cit> . however, the mutated gene has not been characterized yet. from the direct sequencing of the genomic dna region containing bri <dig>  we found that this plant contains a mutation in bri <dig> called bri1- <dig>  bri1- <dig> contains phenylalanine instead of serine at the 399th position in the 13th lrr due to a nucleotide change  at the 1196th position . when we overexpressed wild type bri <dig> in bri1- <dig>  mutant phenotypes of bri1- <dig> were rescued not only morphologically but also in terms of their sensitivities to br . overexpression of the bri1- <dig> protein in wild type plants produced transgenic plants with bri <dig> mutant phenotypes . we believe that bri1- <dig> is the first example of a natural mutant allele with a point mutation in the lrr region of the extracellular domain of bri <dig>  these results suggest that the lrr region before the 70-amino acid island domain is also important in maintaining a fully functional bri <dig> 

tandem array of repeating lrr are known to provide protein-protein interaction motif  <cit> . the plant-specific lrr motif out of seven subfamilies contains 23- <dig> amino acids that form an extended β-strand connected with an α-helix by a loop  <cit> . especially, first  <dig> amino acid residues  in lrr are highly conserved and corresponds the region forming β-strand and loop  <cit> . leucine residues can be compatible with isoleucine , valine , and phenylalanine , which form the hydrophobic core  <cit> . asparagine  in the 9th position is important for half-turn in lrr unit, and serine or threonine are the preferred amino acid in the 8th position, just before the asparagine  <cit> . we found that the first part of amino acid sequence in the 13th lrr of bri <dig>  is well matched with the known consensus sequence. compared with that, the serine residue at the 399th position of bri <dig> in front of the asparagines is changed to phenylalanine in bri1- <dig> mutant. regarding that serine or threonine is able to form an additional hydrogen bond with other part of proteins, it is highly possible that hydrophobic phenylalanine instead of serine residue in bri1- <dig> causes conformational change of lrr motif in the bri <dig>  among other genes encoding the lrr-rlks, clavata <dig>  which involves in meristem differentiation has been reported to have three missense mutant alleles within lrrs: cla1- <dig> in lrr <dig>  clv1- <dig> in lrr <dig>  and clv1- <dig> in lrr <dig>  these mutations were likely to be harmful for the dimerization of clv <dig> with other receptors  <cit> . the har receptor that regulates the nodulation in legumes possesses  <dig> lrrs. mutation in the lrr <dig> in har1- <dig>  which alters β-strand structure, led to the reduced ligand binding  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that conformational changes due to a mutation in the 13th lrrs of bri <dig> affect receptor dimerization or reduce ligand binding capacity. recently, several mutants generated by the tilling method were reported to have amino acid changes in the lrr region of the extracellular domain of bri <dig>  <cit>  , and they are awaiting further analysis to reveal the functional significance of the lrr domain of bri <dig> 

interallelic complemented bri1- <dig> showed different bl sensitivity as compared to the bri1- <dig> overexpressing a bri1:bri1-120-gfp
there have been many reports that the compact and downward-curling rosette leaves that are considered to be weak bri <dig> mutant phenotypes can be restored by the overexpression of the genes encoding the positive regulators of br signaling, such as bak <dig>  <cit> , bsk <dig>  <cit>  and bes <dig>  <cit> , and bri <dig> itself  <cit> . bri1- <dig>  bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> are frequently used in these types of studies. here, we showed that the phenotypic defects in the rosette leaves of bri1- <dig> can be restored in two ways. first, we overexpressed bri1:bri1-120-gfp, causing the bri1- <dig> mutation in bri1- <dig>  and we showed that the transgenic bri1- <dig> displayed an elongated leaf and petiole growth pattern similar to that of the wild type . secondly, we generated plants by crossing bri1- <dig> with bri1- <dig>  receptors that require the assembly of homodimers in order to become active signaling complexes were interallelically complemented  <cit> . however, to date, it has not been elucidated that whether the bri <dig> alleles that have the extracellular domain mutation are able to complement kinase-inactive bri <dig> alleles. by showing that more than half of the f <dig> plants had perfectly wild type-looking overall rosette morphologies, we demonstrated a successful interallelic complementation with two different bri <dig> alleles . the possibility that the genetic recombination between one homologous chromosome with a bri1- <dig> mutation and the other homologous chromosome with a bri1- <dig> mutation occurs during the self fertilization of a f <dig> progeny after the initial cross, resulting in a homologous chromosome without either mutation, cannot be completely ruled out. however, that event seems to occur very rarely, because both mutations are less than  <dig> kb apart.

interestingly, during our analysis, we found significant differences in growth patterns and the br sensitivities between the bri1- <dig> plants rescued by the genetic cross with bri1- <dig> and the bri1- <dig> plants rescued by the transformation of a bri1:bri1-120-gfp construct. the overall rosette phenotype of the rescued bri1- <dig> plants generated by any one of the methods was similar to that of the wild type plants. however, the bri1- <dig> plants overexpressing bri <dig> due to the transformation of bri1:bri1-120-gfp showed reduced root and hypocotyl growth in normal growth conditions compared to the wild type plants. moreover, the br sensitivities of these plants were similar to the br sensitivity of bri1- <dig> based on the inhibition of root growth and cpd expression in response to bl. on the other hand, both root and hypocotyl growth and br sensitivity almost completely reverted to wild type levels in the plants heterozygous for each mutated allele due to the cross of bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> . it is possible that although the bri1- <dig> phenotypes could be rescued by both a transgenic approach, transformation of bri1:bri1-120-gfp gene, and a genetic cross with bri1- <dig>  different growth pattern in detail and the br sensitivity between both lines were resulted from the more accumulation of the bri1-120-gfp proteins in transgenic bri1- <dig>  because expression level of transgene was diverse in each transgenic plant. we also cannot rule out the possibility that the increased amount of bri1-120-gfp proteins in transgenic bri1- <dig> affected only rosette development with unknown mechanisms yet. taken together, these results suggest that observing the shape of the rescued rosette, including the elongated leaves and petioles, is not likely to be a precise way to determine br sensitivity. a recent publication supported this view. albrecht et al.   <cit>  reported that the overexpression of atserk <dig> in bri1- <dig> led to the appearance of the rescued compact rosette leaves but did not promote hypocotyl growth. additionally, we previously showed similar phenomena when bak <dig> was overexpressed in bri1- <dig>  <cit> . conventionally, several indicators, such as the conversion of the rosette leaf phenotypes from compact, curled and dark-green elongated, the inhibition and promotion of the root and hypocotyl growth, respectively, the transcriptional inhibition of cpd expression, and the bl-induced accumulation of dephosphorylated bes <dig>  have been used to denote normal br sensitivity. we believe that each experimental method represents a different degree of br sensitivity. in that sense, the rescued rosette phenotype does not reflect heightened bl sensitivity as compared to any other method. however, the changes observed in the outward appearance of the weak bri <dig> mutant phenotype can still be regarded as useful indicators the genetic suppressor screening of bri <dig> mutants to find additional regulators involved in br signaling. a bri <dig> co-receptor bak <dig>  <cit> , brs <dig>   <cit> , brl <dig>   <cit> , bsu <dig>   <cit> , and ben <dig>   <cit> , and recently published tcp <dig>   <cit>  are examples of bri <dig> suppressors identified in the activation-tagged bri1- <dig>  in addition, the proteins involved in er quality control were revealed allele-specifically in the genetic suppressor screening of ems-mutagenized bri1- <dig>  <cit> . bri1- <dig> was also used for the suppressor screening in the activation tagged pools, resulting in the identification of several atbs genes, including one encoding a bhlh transcription factor that regulates br signaling   <cit>  and yucca, which is involved in tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis   <cit> . these results imply that the suppressor screening of bri <dig> mutant alleles with rosette leaf phenotypes can allow for the mining of genes related to diverse cellular functions in addition to br signaling. we believe that bri1- <dig> is a suitable mutant allele for this purpose. we are currently performing genetic screening to search for modulators of bri1- <dig>  to expand the understanding of the functions of this gene.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary we demonstrated that the mutant previously referred to as cp <dig> that shows retarded growth and reduced br sensitivity is allelic to bri <dig>  and we renamed it bri1- <dig>  the analysis of a point mutation in the 13th lrr that resides before the 70-amino acid island portion of the extracellular domain of bri <dig> has indicated that this specific lrr region is critical for proper bri <dig> functioning. using bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig>  we revealed that interallelic complementation is able to occur between the extracellular domain mutant allele and the cytoplasmic kinase-inactive mutant allele of bri <dig> in vivo.
