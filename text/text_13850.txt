BACKGROUND
in this paper we report the complete chloroplast genome sequences of the angiosperms nuphar advena  and ranunculus macranthus . the nymphaeaceae is placed very near or even at the base of extant angiosperms  <cit> , whereas the ranunculus chloroplast genome represents the basal-most eudicot characterized to date  <cit> . thus we add to the small number of genomes not representing monocots or crown eudicots, increasing our ability to compare genomes across all angiosperms and determine general characteristics. most chloroplast genomes in angiosperms  range from  <dig> to  <dig> kb and exist, at least in part  <cit>  as single genome circles. in the majority of angiosperm chloroplast genomes two copies of a large inverted repeat  of about  <dig> kb separate the remainder of the genome into two regions of unique dna, the large  and small  single copy regions . tobacco , the first completely sequenced chloroplast genome  <cit> , is most frequently used to contrast features of newly studied angiosperm cpdnas and is parsimoniously inferred to represent the ancestral  angiosperm chloroplast genome in terms of gene content and organization  <cit> . this is reinforced by the similarity of the tobacco cpdna to the basal angiosperms, amborella  <cit>  and nymphaea  <cit> , and the magnolids, calycanthus  <cit> drimys, liriodendron, and piper  <cit> . in some derived angiosperm lineages, this ancestral condition has been somewhat or highly modified via inversions, gene losses, presence or absence of orfs and minor ycfs, and changes in ir extent  <cit> . however, the tobacco-like pattern is widely distributed in crown eudicots, e.g., panax  <cit> , eucalyptus  <cit> , and gossypium  <cit> .

comparative chloroplast genomics as well as detailed characterizations of individual chloroplast genomes serve as the basis for functional genomic studies  <cit>  and can direct attempts at chloroplast transformation for genetic engineering  <cit> . in addition the chloroplast genome is an important source of genetic markers for phylogenetic analysis, population-level studies, genotyping and mapping that can be further exploited with additional genomic characterization and comparison. detailed comparisons of genomic sequence have the potential, for example, to identify functional sequence outside of coding regions , test the reality of hypothetical protein coding regions, make inferences about mutational rates and mechanisms, and detect selective signatures in gene sequences. many fundamental aspects of the chloroplast genome are poorly understood and incompletely described. here we use genomic comparisons to investigate the likelihood that ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> are not protein-coding genes, the occurrence of microsatellites or simple sequence repeats , the presence of somewhat larger more complex repeats or small disperse repeats  and how nucleotide composition contributes to patterns of genome organization such as codon usage and repeat structure.

RESULTS
genomic characteristics, including ir extent
both the nuphar  and ranunculus  genomes exhibit the quadripartite structure common to most land plant genomes with large and small single copy regions  separated by two copies of the ir. the nuphar chloroplast genome  is  <dig>  bp in total length; the lsc is  <dig>  bp, the ssc  <dig>  bp and the two ir copies each  <dig>  bp in length. in ranunculus , the overall length is  <dig>  bp with a lsc of  <dig>  bp, a ssc of  <dig>  bp, and two ir regions each of  <dig>  bp. as is common to chloroplast genomes in general  <cit> , the nucleotide composition of both of these genomes are biased towards a and t nucleotides, i.e., they are "a+t-rich". overall the nuphar genome is  <dig> % a+t and ranunculus  <dig> % a+t. different regions of the genome vary in a+t content, but all partitions are a+t rich with the exception of the two classes of rna genes .

although the two copies of the ir were not sequenced independently, the identity of the two copies could still be assessed. all random reads generated from the two ir regions falsely assemble in one location, but presumably about half of the reads are sequenced from one copy of the repeat and half from the other. if the two copies varied in sequence, one would expect, on average, half the reads to reflect one variant and half the other, but all reads that assembled into this region for both nuphar and ranunculus were identical in sequence. in fact, throughout the entire cpdna of nuphar, only one case of potential heteroplasmy was observed, where four reads indicated a run of  <dig> as and four others indicated  <dig>  in ranunculus no cases of high quality mismatch involving more than a single read were detected, even though multiple individuals contributed to the sequencing template. nucleotide polymorphisms in chloroplast dna sequences have been detected in several other groups. in the completely sequenced pelargonium genome  <cit> ,  <dig> polymorphisms were detected and nine of these were located in the lsc. unfortunately, it was not possible to determine if the differences in nuphar or pelargonium represent heteroplasmy because multiple individuals were used in both studies. heteroplasmy in the chloroplast genome has been detected in several other groups, including rice  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , and senecio  <cit> .

the ir extent in nuphar and ranunculus, as well as those of the basal angiosperms sequenced by goremykin et al  <cit> , were confirmed independently of the primary sequencing effort by pcr amplification and sequencing of the boundary regions. although all these genomes contain irs similar in extent to those of nicotiana and many other angiosperms, some minor modifications were detected . as is common among angiosperms, a complete copy of ycf <dig> spans the ssc/ira junction and the 5'end of the gene is duplicated at the ssc end of irb. among the comparisons shown in figure  <dig>  the amount of ycf <dig> that is duplicated ranges from  <dig> bp in nymphaea to  <dig>  bp in amborella. at the lsc end of the ir, there is variation in these taxa over whether and how much of the gene trnh is duplicated. no part of trnh is duplicated in calycanthus or nicotiana but amounts ranging from one bp in nymphaea to the entire gene  in nuphar have been incorporated into the ir. the trnh gene has also been incorporated in the ir of drimys but not in the other two recently sequenced magnoliid genomes, liriodendron, and piper  <cit> . large or complex changes in the extent of the ir should make distinctive markers of evolutionary lineages  <cit> . however, given the small size of the changes discussed here and the relative ease of small  movements of the ir boundaries  <cit> , the amount of ycf <dig> duplicated and the migration of trnh relative to the ir would not make very reliable phylogenetic markers.

gene content, including ycf <dig> and ycf68
the gene content and arrangement of nuphar and ranunculus plastid genomes  are identical with each other and with nymphaea, calycanthus, amborella and nicotiana  except for details of the ir extent , whether or not infa occurs as a pseudogene  or a functional copy , and the nature of ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> . seventy-nine different protein-coding genes , four rrna genes and  <dig> trna genes occur in these genomes. eighteen of these genes contain introns including two genes, clpp and ycf <dig>  each with two introns, and one gene, rps <dig>  also composed of three exons, but with the 5' exon separated from the two 3' exons. these features are common characteristics of land plant chloroplast genomes  <cit> .

the hypothetical gene ycf <dig> was first identified as orf <dig> in nicotiana  <cit>  and has been included in the annotation of a subset of the completed land plant genomes. however, the validity of ycf <dig> as a protein-coding gene has been questioned  <cit> . schmitz-linneweber et al  <cit>  found that the plastomes of nicotiana, epifagus and cuscuta contain intact copies of ycf <dig>  whereas those of spinacia and arabidopsis contain ycf <dig> as two pieces, with the 5' and 3' sections separated by 250â€“ <dig> bp of 'intervening sequence'. they reasoned that if ycf <dig> is a functional protein in spinach, then the intervening sequence would need to be removed and the 5' and 3' sections spliced in order to make a functional ycf <dig> mature transcript. if the intervening sequence were not removed, numerous in-frame stop codons would lead to a truncated protein . reverse transcription experiments in spinach determined that ycf <dig> was not spliced  and so presumably was not translated in spinach  <cit> . they concluded that the ycf <dig> sequence, since it is highly conserved, probably has functional significance but probably does not code for a protein. using an alternative approach, goremykin et al  <cit>  compared nucleotide substitution rates  in ycf <dig> and found a ratio that suggests ycf <dig> is not a protein evolving under evolutionary constraint.

we examined the ycf2:trnl spacer region, where ycf <dig> is located, in several chloroplast genomes, including nuphar and ranunculus, to determine the distribution and nature of ycf <dig> . schmitz-linneweber et al.  <cit> , based on their small sample of taxa, suggested that the distribution of the interrupted versus uninterrupted ycf <dig> sequence, whether or not the sequence codes for a protein, might have phylogenetic significance. that indeed appears to be the case; all taxa, among those we examined, that contain an uninterrupted ycf <dig> motif are asterids and no asterid has the interrupted form . we assume, based on the sequence similarity of the intervening sequence, that the schmitz-linneweber et al.  <cit>  finding of lack of splicing in spinacia is likely to hold for other interrupted forms of the motif. the existence of the widely distributed interrupted form suggests that this is not a protein-coding gene in any of these genomes. if this truly is a protein-coding gene in the asterids, we would have to imagine that pseudogenes  are being retained, conserved over broad evolutionary distances, and either that the active form was inactivated multiple times by the insertion of the same intervening sequence at the same location or that an inactivated gene was re-activated in the asterids through the excision of the intervening sequence. thus, we concur that ycf <dig> is unlikely to represent a protein-coding gene and so we did not annotate the sequence in either genome.

a ycf <dig> is  <dig> bp in the original annotation of nicotiana,  <dig> bp in amborella,  <dig> bp in nymphaea and calycanthus,  <dig> bp in  <dig> bp in arabidopsis,  <dig> bp in gossypium,  <dig> bp in vitus,  <dig> bp in atropa,  <dig> bp in nicotiana sp. and solanum sp.,  <dig> bp in lycopersicon,  <dig> bp in helianthus, and  <dig> bp in panax.

b n/a = not applicable 

similarly a second hypothetical protein-coding gene, ycf <dig>  also may not code for a protein. this conserved motif has been reported in the trni-gau intron of rice , corn , pinus , eucalyptus  and nymphaea. wheat and sugarcane also contain an orf in this region apparently homologous to that of rice and corn  <cit> . we did not find an equivalent sequence in the chloroplast genome of any alga, which all lack an intron in the trni-gau gene, or in selaginella, which lacks the trni-gau gene . in the plastid genomes of all other vascular plant taxa examined, a similar sequence occurs in the trni intron but in the majority of cases it contains numerous frameshifts and stop codons . based only on its length and lack of internal stop codons, the ycf <dig> sequence could represent a functional protein-coding gene in the grasses, nymphaeales, and in the gymnosperms pinus thunbergii and p. koraiensis. however, in the others it can only be, at most, a pseudogene. again, it seems unlikely that a non-functional gene could remain as conserved as the motif seen here over such vast evolutionary distances. if the sequence has any functional significance it must be other than coding for a protein, for example, in intron excision or in gene regulation. we did attempt to detect relationships between the conserved ycf <dig> motif and folding of the intron without success . we did not include ycf <dig> in the annotation of either nuphar or ranunculus.

to further investigate the properties of these two "ycfs" we applied two additional approaches: 1) graphing codon usage patterns, following echols et al.  <cit> , of these putative genes relative to that of known genes and non-coding regions; and 2) comparing the level of conservation in the ycf15- and ycf68-containing regions with other similar regions using mulan  <cit> . codon usage results were ambiguous . the mulan results, though intuitive, were instructive . we compared the ycf15-containing intergenic spacer as well as five other similarly sized igs  to the homologous regions in nicotiana, for each of  <dig> genomes . for ycf <dig>  we did similar comparisons, using zea as the reference taxon, of the trni-gau  intron, two other introns from the ir and three introns from the lsc . in both cases, but especially for the intron  comparison, it can be seen that other igs or intron sequences are as  conserved as the ycf regions and that non-coding sequences  are much more conserved in the ir than in the lsc. thus, it is seems likely that these regions  are conserved, not because they serve some function, but simply because they are in the inverted repeat; they simply appear to code for a polypeptide chain of suggestive length due to chance and are conserved across large evolutionary distances because of the especially low rates of change within the ir  <cit> .

codon usage
we examined codon usage patterns in nuphar and ranunculus for the  <dig> protein-coding genes . we compared start codon usage in ten representative genomes being careful to compare homologous positions as much as possible.  for five genes in each organism , either acg or gtg appear to be used as an alternative to atg as the start codon, as is common for a variety of genes in the plastid genomes of seed plants . in the pteridophytes, huperzia  and adiantum  <cit> , even more genes  use alternative start codons, and the pteridophyte repertoire includes gcg and att, in addition to acg and gtg.

pseudogenes and orfs were not included. dashes in a cell indicate that that gene is absent from that genome.

overall codon usage in the nuphar and ranunculus genomes  is generally similar to that reported from other genomes such as panax  <cit> , lotus  <cit>  and nicotiana  <cit> . as in these and other genomes  <cit>  where the genetic code is redundant, codons with a third position nucleotide of a or t are used more frequently than those terminating in g or c . the base composition at each of the three codon positions varies, with the first position having the lowest proportion of a+t and the third position the highest . it has been suggested that codon usage patterns are driven by this composition bias  <cit> . however, when we apply methods to assess the impact of nucleotide composition on codon usage within nuphar and ranunculus, it appears that the a+t-richness of the third position is at most a partial influence on codon usage. we used codonw  <cit>  to calculate a variety of codon usage statistics that we then contrasted graphically . correspondence analysis of codon usage  was calculated based on codon usage as well as relative synonymous codon usage . in each case the first two axes together explained only a modest amount of the variation  and plotting each of the  <dig> degenerate codons on the first and second axes did not produce a pattern related to the a+t-richness of the third position in the codon sequence , except that codons ending in a or t are more tightly clustered than the codons ending in g or c. these results suggest that a+t-richness is not the most important factor in explaining variation in codon use. in addition we graphed each gene on the two axes enc  and gc <dig>  . if codon usage is random with respect to factors other than a+t-richness  of the third position, each gene is expected to fall on the prediction line for enc based solely on its gc <dig> value  <cit> . again our results reinforce the finding that factors other than nucleotide composition are operating in the plastid genome to select among synonymous codons across genes, in that most points do not fall on the prediction line. other studies, for example wall and herbeck's study of codon bias in the plastid gene rbcl  <cit> , also have found that codon usage patterns are not explained by g+c patterns. finally, we calculated coa eigen values for each gene for the nuphar or ranunculus genome . the eigen values for the primary axes are higher  than those seen for codons  and plotting each gene on the first two axes produces patterns  suggesting that different functional groups of genes have different codon usage and amino acid usage patterns as has been found in broader comparisons  <cit> . overall, although a+t-richness of the third position is the most obvious pattern observable in plastome codon usage, other factors are important in determining codon usage patterns in particular genes .

comparisons of nuphar and nymphaea
between the nuphar and nymphaea chloroplast genomes, we compared each individual gene, intron or intergenic spacer  region and calculated percent similarity . for summary calculations, only one copy of each region in the ir was included and identities for multiple introns within a single gene were calculated separately. more than two-thirds of nuphar regions match the homologous region of nymphaea at a similarity level of 95% or higher; only 3% of the genomes fell below a threshold of 70% identity. as expected, coding regions are more highly conserved than igs on average, although not in all cases. all four genes for rrnas are 100% identical and those for trnas have at least 95% identity. three protein-coding genes are 90â€“94% identical and all others are at least 95% identical. in some cases igs and introns are more similar than coding regions â€“ 60% of introns and 41% of igs are at least 95% identical in sequence between the two genomes. interestingly, the distribution patterns of the numbers of igs and the numbers of introns in the different percent identity categories appeared quite similar, suggesting that similar forces may impact both types of non-coding sequences.

detailed percent identity comparisons are rarely reported for individual regions of entire chloroplast genomes. one study compared sugar cane with rice, maize and wheat and reported comparisons as one of three categories: 0â€“30%, 31â€“79% and 80â€“100%  <cit> . as one might expect, most of the regions fell into the latter category. timme et al.  <cit>  compared sequence divergence in both coding and non-coding regions between two completely sequenced chloroplast genomes from representatives of two of the subfamilies of asteraceae. their results showed that intergenic spacer regions were nearly two times as divergent as introns, and that the  <dig> most divergent coding sequences represent several different functional groups, including photosynthetic genes, ribosomal proteins, and ndh genes. another study compared divergence within functional groups across four different species in three genera of solanaceae and found that rna and photosynthesis genes are the most conserved  <cit> , consistent with the results from a second solanceae comparison based on individual coding regions  <cit> . kim and lee  <cit> , in their comparison of coding regions  from  <dig> fully sequenced vascular plant chloroplast genomes, found the four rrna genes to be the least divergent, followed by psba, psbd, rps <dig>  psbe, psbl and petb. the most conserved coding regions in nuphar-nymphaea are similar in that the four rrna genes, rps <dig>  psbl and petb are also among the most conservative genes but differ in including petn, psbm, and rpl <dig> among the  <dig> most conserved coding regions.

we also examined indels  between nuphar and nymphaea which, of course, are much more likely to occur in igs than in coding regions. in our study,  <dig> % of insertions and  <dig> % of deletions occurred in igs , comparable to results from a similar comparison between sugarcane and maize where  <dig> % of insertions and  <dig> % of deletions occurred in igs  <cit> . in another study, the comparison of two varieties of rice  found  <dig> indels between those two plastid genomes  <cit> , whereas we found almost four times as many , but, of course, our taxa are less closely related. however a study comparing atropa belladonna to nicotiana tabaccum, a comparison perhaps more comparable to ours, found  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions equal to or larger than five bp in intergenic regions and introns  <cit> , whereas we found  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions in nuphar relative to nymphaea. together the combined lengths of the indels account for  <dig> % of the total genome length of atropa and  <dig> % of the genome length in the rice comparison, but  <dig> % of the genomic length in the nuphar-nymphaea comparison.

only recently have plastome sequences been available for closely related taxa, allowing for detailed comparisons  <cit> . these comparisons suggest that non-coding sequences within the genome evolve more rapidly in terms of both substitution and indel mutations, although this is not universally so . comparisons across studies show that some regions are consistently slow to evolve and others commonly evolve at a higher rate but at least minor differences are seen across these studies. before general patterns and processes can be identified more genomic data allowing for such comparisons will need to become available.

repeat analysis â€“ simple sequence repeats 
we screened for perfect ssrs in nuphar, ranunculus and  <dig> other chloroplast genomes . we report the number of mononucleotide repeats â‰¥  <dig> nt, dinucleotide repeats â‰¥  <dig> nt , and trinucleotide repeats â‰¥  <dig> nt ; hereafter referred to collectively as the  <dig> , <dig> ssrs. we also report the number of longer repeats â‰¥  <dig> nt/repeats for mononucleotide runs, â‰¥  <dig> nt  for dinucleotide repeats, and â‰¥  <dig> nt  for trinucleotide repeats; referred to collectively as the  <dig> , <dig> ssrs. of course, any particular threshold  is rather arbitrary and no consensus has developed on what nucleotide length or repeat unit number is significant  <cit> . however, it has been suggested that ssrs of length  <dig> nt or more  are prone to slip-strand mispairing , whereas those of lesser length are not  <cit> . elsewhere the critical threshold is estimated at 7â€“ <dig> bp  <cit> . other workers have chosen similar thresholds, of  <dig> or  <dig> nt, in their reports . the number of  <dig> , <dig> ssrs vary from  <dig> in pinus thunbergii to  <dig> in lotus and comprise between  <dig> and  <dig> % of the chloroplast genome. the number of  <dig> , <dig> ssrs range from  <dig> in one of the rice genomes to  <dig> in medicago.

we calculated, based on the data presented in table  <dig>  spearman rank correlation statistics  to look for relationships between the number of short and long ssrs and between genome size and the total number of ssrs . if some genomes are generally more likely to contain ssrs  and a common mechanism  controlled the likelihood of ssr presence, then a correlation between short and long ssrs would be predicted. alternatively if some genomes were predisposed to long ssrs whereas others were less likely for ssrs to attain greater length, then no correlation might be seen or even a negative correlation might be observed. genome size and total number of ssrs should be correlated if ssrs occur randomly. both these comparisons showed a small but significant positive relationship. genomes with a higher number of "short" ssrs  were more likely to have a higher number of "long" ssrs  â€“ figure  <dig> , rs =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . larger genomes were more likely to contain more ssrs than smaller genomes â€“ figure  <dig> , rs =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  . thus we can infer that the larger the genome the more ssrs are to be expected and that "long" and "short" ssrs most likely are simply points on a continuum evolving under similar mechanisms. however these two factors explain only a portion of the variance in ssr number.

for a subset of the chloroplast genomes, we conducted a more detailed comparison of the ssrs , including all of the then available basal angiosperms and basal eudicots, plus a pteridophyte, a conifer, two derived eudicots and one monocot. in these comparisons we characterized repeats based on nucleotide composition in addition to length and number. we then compared  the predicted and observed number of repeats of various types and the predicted and observed ratios between repeats of various compositions. for all types of repeats, of all lengths and all compositions, in all genomes, fewer ssrs were observed than were predicted. in many cases the difference between the number of ssrs predicted and the number observed was more than an order of magnitude. for mononucleotide repeats in most angiosperms, the ratio of a or t  containing runs to g or c  containing runs was not significantly different from the ratio predicted from the genomic base composition. however, in the two nymphaeaceae , pinus and huperzia, the observed ratio of w to s mononucleotide ssrs was significantly different from the predicted ratio . interestingly the observed ratio was skewed in favor of s  containing repeats. when predicted ratios of dinucleotide repeats were calculated based on the overall nucleotide composition, all genomes showed a significantly biased ratio . in this case more ws ssrs were observed than expected and fewer ww ssrs. when the dinucleotide calculations were repeated based on the genomic dinucleotide frequencies, the deviation of the observed from the expected was less and for arabidopsis and triticum was not significant. again where there is a deviation from expected, the ws category is elevated and the ww category is reduced in the observed. finally, in calculations related to trinucleotide ssr compositions and based on overall trinucleotide composition, all but arabidopsis and triticum showed biased compositional ratios. bias was due primarily to fewer www ssrs than expected. thus, surprisingly, whenever the observed compositional ratio of ssrs was different from expectation , the deviation was due to a deficiency of w  containing repeats.

other  genomes that are a+t rich have been found to exhibit a strong overrepresentation of a or t mononucleotide ssrs, e.g., caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  and plasmodium falciparum  <cit>  and various explanations for this have been offered. because a-t base pairs are held together by two hydrogen bonds rather than three, a-t containing repeats are easier to denature and therefore perhaps more prone to slip-strand mispairing . other explanations include mutational bias , involvement of a-t runs in gene regulation  <cit> , and regions being more mutagenic due to a-t runs . although these proposals seem reasonable, ssrs  are underrepresented in the plastid genomes in contrast also to the work of dieringer and schlotterer  <cit>  who found ssrs overrepresented when comparing nine nuclear genomes. they predicted that the more biased from equal nucleotide composition the genome the greater the density of microsatellites . for the genomes considered in our detailed comparison, we tested for correlation between various aspects of nucleotide composition and ssr frequency. only a and t mononucleotide repeat density correlated with genomic nucleotide composition . so this correlation can be seen even when the w repeats are not over represented. g and c mononucleotide repeat density did not correlate with nucleotide composition and di- and tri-nucleotide repeat densities correlated neither with genomic frequencies nor with di- or tri-nucleotide frequencies calculated over the entire genome . we note that gpc and cpg based  repeats are completely absent from all the plastid genomes examined. this may be the result of selection against these motifs in addition to simple nucleotide composition  as ss-based dinucleotide repeats are absent or strongly underrepresented in other genomes as well  <cit> . presumably some mechanism  in the chloroplast genome is acting on the plastid genomes such that many fewer ssrs are observed than would be expected and that mechanism is acting more strongly on w-containing repeats than s-containing ones.

in an alternative attempt to clarify underlying patterns and mechanisms of ssr evolution, we compared the  <dig> , <dig> ssrs between nuphar and nymphaea to determine how many of the ssrs were shared  between these two genomes from relatively closely related plants . the nuphar genome contains more than twice as many  <dig> , <dig> ssrs as the nymphaea genome â€“  <dig> in nuphar,  <dig> in nymphaea. sixty-six different  <dig> , <dig> ssrs occur in the combined set. the vast majority, but not all, of the ssrs occur in non-coding dna . the majority  of these repeats are shared between the two genomes; most are simply lower than the reporting threshold in one genome or the other. of the  <dig> shared ssrs, only seven are the same length in both genomes. where the shared ssrs are of different lengths, in  <dig> cases length differences were due to ssm, in  <dig> cases due to a nucleotide substitution, in four cases due to an indel  and in eight cases due to a combination of mechanisms. of the  <dig> ssrs not shared,  <dig> were found only in nuphar and only two in nymphaea. thus, it appears that nuphar is more likely to have these ssrs and for the ssrs to be longer when they occur; in  <dig> of the  <dig> cases where shared repeats differ in length the nuphar ssr is longer.

it is thought that ssrs begin as random runs of nucleotides  <cit> . any bias in mutation patterns or nucleotide composition would make certain runs more likely. then, once present in a location, the repeat would grow via ssm  <cit> . longer ssrs lead to more stable heteroduplex intermediates, making ssm more likely  <cit> . however longer ssrs also have higher mutations rates  <cit> . one model of ssr evolution posits that the distribution of repeat lengths in a genome represents an equilibrium between ssm and point mutation  <cit> . in the nuphar-nymphaea comparison ssm and point mutation occur with about equal frequency, consistent with this hypothesis. in terms of phylogenetic utility of ssr variation, the nuphar-nymphaea comparison suggests that individual ssrs are stable at least over relatively short periods of evolutionary time and that they do commonly vary in repeat number. however the small size of most repeats probably limits their utility and more needs to be known about the specifics of ssr evolution before any phylogenetic utility can be fully realized. understanding more about the processes of ssr evolution will also help us investigate possible selective or functional roles for these motifs.

repeat analysis â€“ small dispersed repeats 
we also searched for sdrs in the plastomes of representative angiosperms. these repeats are based on a more complex motif and are longer than ssrs. our sdr analysis, within each of the eight genomes, identified 114â€“ <dig> direct and inverted repeats  <dig> bp or longer with a sequence identity of at least 80% . the number of repeats was lowest in nymphaea  and highest in arabidopsis . in most cases, the number of direct repeats  was substantially higher than the number of inverted repeats . the vast majority  of the repeats were only 30â€“ <dig> bp in length and the longest repeat was  <dig> bp in triticum.

blast comparisons of the repeats identified in each of the genomes were performed against all other genomes to locate shared repeats with an e-value of  <dig>  although these comparisons were performed using the repeats in each of the eight genomes as the reference, we only present the results  using nymphaea as the reference genome because it had the fewest number of repeats and thus would contain any repeats shared throughout all these genomes. overall, the analyses identified  <dig> groups of shared repeats among these eight angiosperm chloroplast genomes, ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the majority of the shared repeats were located within intergenic spacer regions and introns. however repeats were sometimes found within genes and some cases represented inter-trna similarities within different families of trna genes. the largest shared repeat  represents shared sequence between psaa and psab. in general, the longer shared sdrs  tend to have lower a+t-richness . however, most  of the shared sdrs are short, between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length. this class of sdrs shows the widest range in a+t-richness  but most exhibit a+t-richness of greater than 50%. most shared sdrs are present in only a small number of copies. only two repeats occur more than four times in the genomes ; one is  <dig> nt long  and the other, occurring about  <dig> times, is  <dig> nt long . overall, no trends were detected between repeat location, number, length, and a+t-richness.

repeated sequences are generally considered to be uncommon in chloroplast genomes with the notable exception of the large ir present in most land plants  <cit> . dispersed repeats are found more commonly in genomes that have experienced changes in genome organization  <cit> , especially in highly rearranged algal genomes  <cit> . a correlation between the number of repeats and the extent of gene order change has been suggested for algal genomes  <cit> . however, comparisons of completely sequenced chloroplast genomes of the angiosperm families fabaceae  <cit> , solanaceae  <cit> , and asteraceae  <cit>  have revealed the presence of numerous small repeats scattered throughout these genomes even though these genomes have few if any rearrangements. in each of these families assessed by others, most of the repeats are  <dig> â€“  <dig> bp in length and they are located mostly in intergenic spacer regions and introns, although several are located in the protein-coding genes psaa, psab, and ycf <dig>  our examination of repeats here in eight angiosperm chloroplast genomes, representing a wider phylogenetic diversity than that of earlier studies, identified numerous repeats in each genome of a nature and pattern similar to those reported by others based on narrower comparisons . again here, some of the shared sdr repeats, such as those located in trna genes and those shared between psaa and psab, result from conserved sequence similarity of related genes. the vast majority of the plastome sdrs are restricted to intergenic spacer regions and introns and are small in size. earlier work suggesting that larger repeats  are rare in unrearranged plastid genomes is supported. however, the pattern that seems to be emerging from all of these analyses is that small sdrs in angiosperm genomes are quite common and they tend to be located in the same regions. the role of these conserved repeats is not known but given that many of them are shared broadly and are located in the same regions suggests that some may be functional.

CONCLUSIONS
as additional chloroplast genomes from less-derived angiosperm taxa are characterized we obtain a clearer picture of the ancestral plastid genome organization for angiosperms. in large part these additional genomes  confirm that the nicotiana plastome is reasonably inferred to represent the ancestral angiosperm for gene content and organization, although perhaps not for exact ir boundaries. with notable exceptions, these features, seen in nicotiana, are remarkably conserved in most angiosperm lineages. the nuphar advena and ranuculus macranthus chloroplast genome sequences add to this growing body of data for reconstructing the evolution of plastid genomes. the nuphar genome, in addition, provided the opportunity for comparison with the relatively closely related nymphaea alba plastome sequence. this comparison confirmed views on the conservative nature of the genome, with even some igs regions showing very high levels of nucleotide similarity. the nuphar-nymphaea comparison also supported the view that ssr frequencies represent a balance between two mutation types: ssm and substitutions. detailed comparisons among these and other genomes reveal many differences and unexplained conservation of features that both remain to be understood. however, we are able to suggest that the widely conserved sequences designated ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> are not protein-coding genes.

as has been noted many times elsewhere, chloroplast genomes are biased towards a and t nucleotides, i.e., are "a+t-rich", except for the rna genes. howe et al.  <cit>  suggest that the a+t-richness of plastid genomes is the result of endosymbiosis . they argue that there might be a selective advantage for a particular protein-coding gene to be either a+t-rich or g+c-rich and that each class of genes can be maintained through compartmentalization in the different genomes  <cit> . however, many other genomes, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, are as a+t-rich as  plastid genomes  <cit> . we suggest that the plastome a+t bias is relatively modest and results from a slight mutation and/or error checking bias of the plastid dna polymerases or perhaps some selection for a and t in otherwise neutral positions to increase ease of denaturation during replication or transcription. in any event, a bias can be seen in overall composition, in the composition of the 3rd position of codons, and in which ssr motifs are most abundant, among other aspects of the genomic sequence. however on closer inspection a+t richness does not correlate with variation in codon usage or details of ssr abundance. we speculate that the interesting patterns are those that fail to track patterns of a+t-richness; for example, repeat sequences in non-coding regions enriched for g and c are the ones more likely to be functional and understanding the components of codon bias that is not related to a+t-richness is more likely to be significant.
