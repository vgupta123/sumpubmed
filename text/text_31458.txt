BACKGROUND
wdr <dig>  is associated with cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation and disequilibrium syndrome   <cit> , also referred to as uner tan syndrome  <cit> . the missense mutation, wdr <dig> p.p856l, which is located in exon  <dig> of the wdr <dig> isoform  <dig>  results in significant decreases in the volume of the cerebellum and corpus callosum  <cit> . wdr <dig> has also been found to be mutated in >10 % of the colorectal cancer cell lines  <cit> . a mouse study of a mutant line nur <dig>  carrying a mutation in the predicted major facilitator superfamily domain of the wdr <dig> protein, showed a similar phenotype with camrq  <cit> .

the structure of the wdr <dig> protein has been predicted and its expression pattern have been described in both humans and mice. the human wdr <dig> is thought to include a beach  domain on the n-terminus, a major facilitator superfamily  domain following beach domain, and six wd <dig> repeats on the c-terminus. the analysis of the protein sequence led to the hypothesis that wdr <dig> might be a transmembrane protein. the human wdr <dig> is ubiquitously expressed and the highest level of expression was detected in the cerebellum and corpus callosum among other human brain regions  <cit> . in silico domain predictions for the mouse wdr <dig> protein also indicated that it is likely to be a transmembrane protein composed of a beach, an mfs, and six wd <dig> repeat domains  <cit> .wdr <dig> expression was found to be increased in purkinje cells and the molecular layer of cerebellum in the mouse embryonic brain  <cit> . wdr <dig> also has been detected in the neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei, the brainstem, the photoreceptors and the other retinal layers of adult wild type mice  <cit> .

while the exact function of wdr <dig> is yet unknown, information about the predicted domains of the protein might indicate its potential function. proteins containing beach domains are suggested to act as scaffold proteins. they are commonly large proteins and are proposed to function in various membrane-related events such as vesicle fusion and fission, and thus would be involved in vesicular trafficking, membrane dynamics, synapse formation, apoptosis, autophagy and receptor signaling  <cit> . the mfs domain takes place in single-polypeptide secondary carrier proteins, which transport small molecules in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients  <cit> . wd <dig> domain proteins function in several cellular processes, mainly signal transduction, cytoskeleton assembly, regulation of transcription, chromatin dynamics, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and vesicular trafficking by providing a platform for protein–protein or protein-dna interactions  <cit> . thus, the wdr <dig> protein has the potential to alter function in many areas of the central nervous system.

in silico analysis of zebrafish wdr <dig> resulted in the prediction of the identical conserved domains observed in the human and mouse orthologue proteins. this finding emphasizes a conserved function in these three species. in the present study, we aimed at fully characterizing the structure of the wdr <dig> transcript, searching for the presence/absence of possible transcript variants and revealing its temporal and spatial expression in zebrafish. this is the first report of the characterization of the transcript structure and expression of wdr <dig> in zebrafish. we performed rapid amplification of cdna ends  method to characterize the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cdna, and amplified the open reading frame . we examined the expression of the zebrafish orthologue of mammalian wdr <dig>  by employing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  and in situ hybridization on whole mount embryos, adult brain and eye tissue sections. our findings on the transcript structure and expression of the gene of interest will give rise to further research in order to fully understand the function of wdr <dig> in zebrafish, which is a powerful model organism providing ease of genetic manipulations.

the distribution of wdr <dig> expression in adult brain and eye was determined using in situ hybridization. ten micrometer thick coronal sections were taken from the eye and brain of a 10 month old male fish using a cryostat . the in situ hybridization experiment was carried out as described previously  <cit> . the antisense probe was synthesized as mentioned previously in whole mount in situ hybridization section. the same plasmid construct was used as a template for synthesis of the sense probe. ncoi  and apai  were utilized for linearization of the plasmid construct and the sense rna probe was made using the sp <dig> enzyme mix  and dig-labelling mix . the slides were visualized with the brightfield upright microscope .

rapid amplification of cdna ends 
the rapid amplification of cdna ends  method was employed to define the 5′ untranslated region  and 3′ utr of wdr <dig> using 24 hpf embryo and adult brain total rnas. total rnas of brain tissue from three 10 months old male fish and forty  <dig> hpf embryos were isolated with a rneasy mini kit . dnase treatment was performed with a rnase-free dnase set .

characterization of the 5′race product
the generacertm kit  was employed to perform the race experiments. all race assays were carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer. briefly, for the 5′race experiment, total rna samples of pooled  <dig> hpf embryos and 10 months old male fish brains were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase  and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase . then the generacer™ rna oligo was ligated to mrnas in order to obtain a known priming site at the 5′ end. the generacer™ rna oligo ligated mrnas were converted to race ready first-strand cdnas by using cloned amv reverse transcriptase and the generacer™ oligo dt primer. the generacer™ 5′ primer  and the gene specific primer wdr81_racer-5e <dig> , which was designed according to ensembl , were used to amplify the 5′race product of wdr <dig> by touch down pcr. touch down pcr was performed under the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °c, 30 s at 94 °c, 40 s at 72 °c, 45 s at 68 °c for  <dig> cycles; 30 s at 94 °c, 40 s at 71 °c, 45 s at 68 °c for  <dig> cycles; 30 s at 94 °c, 40 s at 70 °c, 45 s at 68 °c for  <dig> cycles; and 5 min at 68 °c. the touch down pcr amplicons of embryo and brain samples were used as templates for nested pcr. primers were the generacer™ 5′ nested primer  and the gene specific nested primer wdr81_racer-5e2_nested , which was designed according to ensembl . nested pcr was performed under the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °c; 30 s at 94 °c, 40 s at 72 °c, 50 s at 68 °c for  <dig> cycles; and 5 min at 68 °c. resulting amplicons were run on a 1 % agarose gel, extracted from the gel  and cloned . colonies were selected based on both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance and plasmids were isolated . the plasmids including the insert were sent for sanger sequencing. results of sanger sequencing were analyzed with clcbio main workbench software package .

characterization of the 3′race product
for the 3′race experiment, the race ready first-strand cdnas were synthesized from total rna samples of pooled  <dig> hpf embryos and 10 months old male zebrafish brains by using cloned amv reverse transcriptase and the generacer™ oligo dt primer. using the generacer™ oligo dt primer provides a known priming site at the 3′ end of the resulting cdna. three overlapping amplicons as 3′race product of wdr <dig> were aimed to be obtained. the  <dig> primer pairs used in this experiment are shown in table  <dig>  no template negative controls were included in the 3′ utr characterization experiments.table  <dig> primer pairs used in the characterization of 3′ end of wdr81




the pcr conditions using primer pair  <dig> in table  <dig> were 40 s at 98 °c; 10 s at 98 °c, 30 s at 68 °c, 35 s at 72 °c for  <dig> cycles; and 5 min at 72 °c; using primer pair  <dig> in table  <dig> were: 40 s at 98 °c; 10 s at 98 °c, 30 s at 64 °c, 40 s at 72 °c for  <dig> cycles; and 5 min at 72 °c; using primer pair  <dig> in table  <dig> were: 2 min at 95 °c; 30 s at 95 °c, 30 s at 61 °c, 60 s at 72 °c for  <dig> cycles; and 7 min at 72 °c. amplicons were directly sent to sanger sequencing after checking for the presence of the single bands on a 1 % agarose gel. results of sanger sequencing were analyzed with the clcbio main workbench software package .

the experiment was designed based on the predicted sequence of wdr81- <dig> , and the pcr product obtained with primer pair  <dig> in table  <dig> was found to be longer than the expected size. the insertion sequence within the amplicon, which was obtained with primer pair  <dig> in table  <dig>  was further analysed by amplifying the same race ready cdnas with a new primer pair. the new primer pair was designed to obtain the insertion site in a shorter frame. the sequence of the forward primer was 5′-cattattatctccagacattccaa-3′ and the sequence of the reverse primer was 5′-tgagggaattagcgaaccat-3′. the pcr conditions using this primer pair was 40 s at 98 °c; 10 s at 98 °c, 30 s at 58 °c, 30 s at 72 °c for  <dig> cycles; and 5 min at 72 °c. the experiment was designed to obtain a 250 bp long amplicon when the predicted sequence is present and there is no insertion site. the amplicons obtained from 24 hpf embryo and brain samples were cloned , colonies were selected based on blue/white screening. plasmids were isolated  and  <dig> plasmids per sample were sequenced. sequences were analyzed with clcbio main workbench software package .

cdnas of  <dig> different adult tissues and  <dig> different development stages were also amplified with the same primer pair to test the presence of the insertion site. these cdnas were amplified with a beta-actin primer pair, whose forward primer was 5′-attgctgacaggatgcagaag-3′ and reverse primer was 5′-gatggtccagactcatcgtactc-3′  <cit>  in order to test the presence and integrity of the cdnas. the amplicons were run on a 1 % agarose gel. the intensity of the bands were measured using image j  <cit> .

bioinformatics analysis
in order to determine the conserved domains of wdr <dig> protein in human, mouse and zebrafish, we aligned and compared the amino acid sequences from  <dig> species. the amino acid sequences encoded by the human wdr <dig> , mouse wdr <dig>  and zebrafish wdr <dig>  were aligned using clustal omega  <cit>  with default parameters. the alignment output file was submitted to espript  <dig> software  <cit> . beach and wd <dig> domain predictions of the smart database  <cit>  and mfs domain prediction  were highlighted on the espript  <dig> output file. the transmembrane domain of the zebrafish wdr <dig> protein was predicted by tmpred software  <cit> .

RESULTS

phylogenetic analysis has shown that the wd repeat containing protein  <dig> is highly conserved among vertebrates  <cit> . the zebrafish wdr <dig> putative protein shares  <dig>  % identity with human wdr <dig> and  <dig>  % identity with mouse wdr <dig> proteins based on the clustal omega alignment  <cit> . the zebrafish wdr <dig> transcript  is composed of twelve exons including predicted sequences of the 5′ utr, open reading frame and 3′ utr . this novel transcript is  <dig> base pairs  in length and its putative protein product is made up of  <dig> amino acid residues. there is one copy of wdr <dig> in the zebrafish genome and it is located on chromosome  <dig>  it has been shown that orthologues of wdr <dig> exist in other fish genomes. spotted gar , amazon molly , fugu , medaka , tetraodon , tilapia , platyfish , cave fish , stickleback  and cod  possess wdr <dig> orthologues with a percentage of identity in protein sequences ranging between  <dig> and 79 %  <cit> . taken together these data demonstrate that wdr <dig> is conserved among vertebrates, including a variety of different fish species.fig.  <dig> genomic structure of the zebrafish wdr <dig> and location of primers. the genomic structure of zebrafish wdr <dig> was derived from the predicted sequence information released by the ensembl database and the open reading frame was amplified based on this information. exons are shown as boxes and introns are shown as lines. location of rna oligos, ligated to the transcript by employing the race kit are shown in gray boxes. arrows in the top box illustrate the approximate binding sites of the primers used in the race experiments. arrows in the lower box indicate the approximate binding sites of primers used to amplify the open reading frame and of qrt-pcr primers



zebrafish wdr <dig> is predicted to be a transmembrane protein, including beach, mfs and wd <dig> repeat domains based on tmpred software, smart database and clc main workbench software predictions, which are consistent with the domain
predictions of human wdr <dig> and mouse wdr <dig> proteins   <cit> . we aligned the putative protein sequence of zebrafish wdr <dig> with human and mouse orthologous proteins using clustal omega, and submitted the resulting alignment file to espript  <dig> software. we highlighted the positions of the predicted domains of human, mouse and zebrafish wd repeat containing protein  <dig>  the most conserved domain among the three species was the beach domain, located between amino acid residues 337– <dig> of zebrafish wdr <dig>  the mfs domain was predicted to take place between amino acid residues 951– <dig> while seven wd <dig> repeats were predicted to reside between amino acid residues 1758– <dig>  1807– <dig>  1850– <dig>  1892– <dig>  1939– <dig>  1980– <dig> and 2027– <dig> of zebrafish wdr <dig>  there existed a difference in the number of wd <dig> repeats among the three species, one more wd <dig> repeat domain was predicted in zebrafish when compared to human and mouse . six membrane spanning domains of the zebrafish wdr <dig> protein were predicted to be located between amino acid residues 665– <dig>  1031– <dig>  1413– <dig>  1463– <dig>  1690– <dig> and 1920– <dig> .

zebrafish wdr <dig> encodes one open reading frame
according to the ensembl database, human wdr <dig> gene has nine known protein coding transcripts and the mouse wdr <dig> gene has three known protein coding transcripts. the zebrafish wdr <dig> gene has one protein coding transcript, wdr81- <dig> . since the human and mouse genes were predicted to have more than one transcript  <cit> , we aimed to fully characterize the structure of the wdr <dig> transcript and test the presence of transcript variants in zebrafish. initially, we amplified the open reading frame  of wdr <dig>  we used  <dig> hpf embryos as a sample from an early development stage and brain as an adult tissue sample. our experimental design included employing ten primer pairs, which span the predicted open reading frame, in order to amplify it as ten overlapping amplicons . pcrs in which  <dig> hpf embryo and brain cdnas were amplified with these primer pairs resulted in one amplicon per reaction, indicating that zebrafish wdr <dig> encodes one open reading frame .fig.  <dig> agarose gel electrophoretic separation of overlapping amplicons of the zebrafish wdr <dig> open reading frame. amplification of the open reading frame from 24 hpf embryo cdna and adult brain cdna resulted in one amplicon per reaction indicating that there is one open reading frame of zebrafish wdr <dig>  since the experiment was designed based on the predicted sequence, this result also confirms the prediction. a amplification of 24 hpf embryo cdna. b amplification of adult brain cdna. lanes

 <dig> and 18 hpf are critical timepoints of development regarding wdr <dig> expression
qrt-pcr revealed the temporal expression of wdr <dig>  we quantified and compared the relative expression values of embryos at ten developmental stages using the primers mentioned as qrt-pcr f and r . expression of wdr <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and 18 hpf timepoints was higher than the expression at 10 hpf, 24 hpf, 48 hpf, 72 hpf, 5 dpf, 15 dpf and 35 dpf timepoints .fig.  <dig> relative temporal expression of wdr <dig> as determined by qrt-pcr.  1 hpf embryo,  5 hpf embryo,  10 hpf embryo,  18 hpf embryo,  24 hpf embryo,  48 hpf embryo,  72 hpf larva,  5 dpf larva,  15 dpf larva,  35 dpf juvenile zebrafish. error bars represent +se



zygotic expression first starts at 3 hpf in zebrafish  <cit> . relative expression analysis of ten developmental stages demonstrated that expression of wdr <dig> was high both before and after zygotic expression starts, showing that wdr <dig> was maternally supplied. expression level decreased dramatically at 10 hpf and increased sharply at 18 hpf. it decreased again at 24 hpf before being maintained during the rest of the developmental period . therefore, regarding wdr <dig> expression,  <dig> and 18 hpf timepoints were found to be critical developmental stages after zygotic expression started.

our whole mount in situ hybridization results were also consistent with the results of the qrt-pcr. a riboprobe detecting a  <dig>  kb region between primers 5f-6r  of the wdr <dig> orf was used and this region includes the sequence which corresponds to the mutation site in human patients. the intensity of the signal weakened after the 18 hpf timepoint. we observed that signals obtained from wdr <dig> rna probe were high at the early developmental stages , then decreased before being maintained at low levels during the rest of the evaluated timepoints . signals were relatively high in the head at  <dig> and 48 hpf timepoints .fig.  <dig> whole mount in situ hybridization revealed differential expression of wdr <dig> transcript during embryonic development. our results from the wmish method are in parallel with the qrt-pcr data. the signal is high during the first  <dig> developmental timepoints , it is decreased and maintained during the rest of the development periods . ov optic vesicle, mb midbrain, le lens, h hindbrain, di diencephalon, mlf medial longitudinal fascicle



wdr <dig> is ubiquitously expressed and enriched in the eye and brain
our whole mount in situ hybridization study in which wdr <dig> expression at six embryonic stages was investigated, also showed ubiquitous expression at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hpf timepoints. the signal was stronger in the optic vesicle  and the midbrain  at the  <dig> hpf timepoint. moreover, the signal was condensed in the lens , diencephalon , midbrain , and medial longitudinal fascicle  at 48 hpf. finally, the signal dramatically decreased at 72 hpf timepoint .

in order to further identify more specifically the brain and eye regions expressing wdr <dig>  we sectioned the head regions of our whole mount in situ embryos from the  <dig>   <dig> and 72 hpf timepoints into 20 μm-thick sections. our data indicated that the highest level of expression was observed at 18 hpf and uniformly distributed throughout the optic vesicle and brain  likely indicating that wdr <dig> is found in all cell types. at 48 hpf, a more select pattern of staining is observed. wdr <dig> gene expression is found in areas which included the preoptic area , diencephalon , midbrain tegmentum , optic nerve, lens, nucleus of the mlf, and the retina. this reduced and more specific pattern, including an association with axonal fibers, likely indicates a neuronal phenotype . the wdr <dig> expression was very reduced by 72 hpf with staining observed in the retina and midbrain tegmentum  .fig.  <dig> transverse sections through the head regions of whole mount in situ hybridization specimens at  <dig> embryonic timepoints. the expression of wdr <dig> was observed in a regionally-specific manner by 48 hpf , whereas it was ubiquitously expressed at 18 hpf , and decreased by 72 hpf . arrows indicate the optic nerve, asterisk the region of the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, and arrowhead the retina. po preoptic area, di diencephalon, t. midbrain tegmentum, le lens, ov optic vesicle, yolk yolk sac. scale bar equals 100 μm



we investigated the spatial expression of wdr <dig> in adults using the same primer pair in the temporal expression study by employing the qrt-pcr method. for this analysis  <dig> different adult tissues were used and these tissues included brain, testis, heart, kidney, liver, intestine, eye, gills, tail, and muscle. our results indicated that the relative expression of wdr <dig> was ubiquitous, however, there were differences in the levels of wdr <dig> expression among tissues .fig.  <dig> relative spatial expression graphic of wdr <dig> as determined by qrt-pcr.  brain,  testis,  heart,  kidney,  liver,  intestine,  eye,  gills,  tail,  muscle. error bars indicate +se



in situ hybridization studies were performed in adult brain and eye tissues in order to further understand the expression pattern of wdr <dig> within these regions. our data demonstrated that although wdr <dig> is found throughout the zebrafish brain and eye tissues, there is regional specificity. the wdr81-positive cells in the brain appeared to be morphologically similar to neurons and there were wdr81-positive fibers . in the cerebellum we observed expression in presumptive purkinje cells and in layers of the retina . positive cells that are presumptive neurons were also found in multiple areas of the brain including the lobus vagus and optic tectum . interestingly we also observed a strong expression pattern in proliferation zones of the zebrafish brain including midline ventricle, which is known as the tectal ventricle, lobus vagus and periventricular gray zone of optic tectum . thus, our data indicate that in the adult brain there is an association of wdr <dig> with areas involved in neurogenesis and based on the morphology they are likely neuronal in nature.fig.  <dig>

characterization of 5′ utr of wdr <dig> confirmed the predicted sequence and characterization of 3′ utr indicated a possible alternative polyadenylation process among tissues
we characterized the cdna ends of wdr <dig> in order to observe whether there were transcript variants related with the 5′ utr and 3′ utr sequences. we performed race to characterize the utr sequences of wdr <dig> and used gene specific and generacer™ primers . the 5′race product was obtained by performing nested pcr followed by touch down pcr and one amplicon per reaction was obtained with the 24 hpf embryo and brain templates . our experimental design was aimed at obtaining the 5′race product as an amplicon, which included the 5′ utr, exon  <dig> and initial sequences of exon  <dig>  the resulting amplicons were cloned and sequenced. sanger sequencing results showed that the 5′ utr of wdr <dig> was found to be 264 bp in length, which was 6 bp shorter than the predicted sequence at the 5′ end .fig.  <dig> agarose gel electrophoretic separation of the 5′race and overlapping 3′race products of zebrafish wdr <dig> transcript. a expected size of the 5′race amplicon based on the experimental design was obtained and one amplicon was observed as a pcr product indicating that there is one 5′ utr structure of zebrafish wdr <dig>  the band of ~692 bp was excised, cloned and sequenced. lane  <dig> 5′race product of 24 hpf embryo wdr <dig> cdna; lane  <dig> 5′race product of brain wdr <dig> cdna; lane  <dig> negative control without template, m puc mix marker  <dig> . expected size of the overlapping 3′race amplicons based on the experiment design were obtained from the pcr experiments with primer pairs  <dig>  and  <dig> from the table  <dig>  the resulting amplicon obtained with primer pair  <dig> was longer than the expected amplicon size indicating presence of an insertion site. one amplicon per reaction was obtained as pcr products concluding that there is one transcript of zebrafish wdr <dig>

the insertion site, which was observed in amplicon  <dig> between the nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> of wdr <dig> cdna, was amplified in a shorter frame, cloned and sequenced. the alignment of the sequences from single colonies, obtained from 24 hpf embryo  and brain  templates, revealed that the insertion site was 266 bp in length . presence of the insertion site was tested in samples from several developmental stages and adult tissues. the insertion site was detected in all the tested samples of developmental stages and most of the tissues  however no amplicon was detected in kidney, intestine and gills . the intensity of the bands in the fig.  <dig> was measured . comparison of the intensities of the pcr products amplified from the insertion site in ten samples from different developmental stages showed that the 35 dpf juvenile zebrafish had the lowest intensity level from the insertion region. when we compared the intensities of the amplicons obtained from the insertion site in  <dig> adult tissues we concluded that the intensity levels of the insertion region are the highest and almost equal in the brain and testis, with the next highest intensity being observed in the eye. the intensity level of the insertion region is almost equal in heart and muscle and this level is followed by tail and liver, respectively.fig.  <dig> a 266 bp long insertion was determined in the 3′ utr of the zebrafish wdr <dig> transcript. results of 3′ utr characterization experiments indicated presence of an insertion site in 24 hpf embryo and adult brain templates. when the insertion site was further analyzed, cloned and sequenced, the sequence of the insertion site from  <dig> single colonies was revealed as being 266 bp in length. twenty-four hpf embryo sample is the insert of plasmids 1– <dig>  1– <dig>  and 1– <dig> and brain sample is the insert of plasmids 2– <dig>  2– <dig>  and 2–6

in conclusion, analysis of the 5′race product revealed that wdr <dig> does not have transcript variants in the 5′ utr. interestingly detection of the insertion site in 3′ utr of wdr <dig> indicates that there might be an alternative polyadenylation event among tissues, which results in different lengths of 3′ utr sequences.

discussion
in the present study, we characterized the novel zebrafish gene, wdr <dig>  a wd repeat-containing protein  <dig>  our study is the first report of the characterization of the wdr <dig> sequence and expression patterns in zebrafish. we observed that zebrafish wdr <dig> encodes one open reading frame and the transcript possesses one 5′ utr. the sequence of 3′ utr confirms the predicted sequence along with a 266 bp long insertion site in 24 hpf embryos and adult brain under our experimental conditions. the insertion site was also detected in testis, heart, liver, eye, tail and muscle, however it was not detected in kidney, intestine and gills. this indicates the possible presence of alternative polyadenylation processes among tissues. five and eighteen hpf are likely to be the critical timepoints of development regarding the expression of the gene of interest because they correspond to peaks in wdr <dig> gene expression levels. wdr <dig> was ubiquitously expressed among tissues and enriched in the eye and brain regions in embryos, the signal of rna probe was stronger in the eye and the midbrain at 18 hpf and was condensed in the lens, diencephalon, midbrain, and medial longitudinal fascicle at 48 hpf, which dropped down at 72 hpf. in the adult brain and eye tissues wdr <dig> was expressed in presumptive neurons based on morphology and associated with neuronal proliferative zones.

human studies have established that the missense mutation in the wdr <dig> isoform  <dig> results in significant decreases in the volume in cerebellum and corpus callosum  <cit>  and the neuro-ophthalmic examination of four patients with camrq displayed downbeat nystagmus  <cit> . wdr <dig> has been found to be mutated in >10 % of the colorectal cancer cell lines  <cit>  and serpinf2-wdr <dig> loci was reported to be one of the six significant loci for serum albumin as a result of transethnic meta-analysis  <cit> . expression of the human wdr <dig> was found to be ubiquitous and enriched in the cerebellum and corpus callosum  <cit> . a mouse study of a mutant line nur <dig>  carrying a mutation in the predicted major facilitator superfamily domain of the wdr <dig> protein, showed a similar phenotype with camrq. this study revealed that wdr <dig> was localized in the mitochondria of purkinje cells and also expressed in photoreceptor cells of the adult animal  <cit> . the findings about wdr <dig> emphasize its importance in neurodevelopment, however, the exact function of the protein is not yet known. in order to provide a basis for functional studies, we aimed at characterizing wdr <dig> in wild type zebrafish.

we showed that the putative zebrafish wdr <dig> includes the identical domains as the human and mouse orthologue proteins. the most conserved domain is beach domain among three species, however, there is a difference in the number of wd <dig> repeats among the three species, one more wd <dig> repeat domain is predicted to exist in zebrafish as compared to human and mouse proteins . conservation of wdr <dig> among vertebrates regarding the phylogenetic analysis  <cit>  and domain predictions  <cit>  suggest a similar function of wdr <dig> in human, mouse and zebrafish.

in order to provide an experimental proof of the prediction made by ensembl  and to test whether there are transcript variants in zebrafish as in mouse and human, we amplified the orf and performed race experiments. we employed the race method to characterize the utr sequences of wdr <dig> because the utr sequences are critical regions in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression  <cit> . we concluded that zebrafish wdr <dig> encodes one open reading frame . the 5′ utr of wdr <dig> was found to be 264 bp in length, which is 6 bp shorter than the predicted sequence at the 5′ end. analysis of the 5′race product revealed that wdr <dig> does not have transcript variants regarding the 5′ utr. the 3′race products were obtained as three overlapping amplicons from 24 hpf embryo and brain samples. one amplicon per reaction was obtained as a result . the 266 bp long insertion site detected in all the tested samples of developmental stages and most of the adult tissues  could not be detected in kidney, intestine and gills . the intensity of the bands amplified from brain, testis and eye are the highest. indeed, gene expression of brain and testis are highly similar in human and mouse  <cit> . eyes are part of the central nervous system and a similar pattern in brain and eyes might be taking place in wdr <dig> 3′ utr. detection of the insertion site in the 3′ utr of wdr <dig> indicates that there might be differences in the polyadenylation events among tissues, which results in different lengths of 3′ utr sequences. alternative polyadenylation events have been previously reported in ubiquitously expressed genes, which provide a mechanism to regulate tissue specific protein levels by changing the ratios of 3′ utr isoforms and changing targets of micrornas and regulatory proteins  <cit> . since the insertion site in 3′ utr might also be a target for micrornas, we searched for potential micrornas which target the sequence of the insertion. we found out that micrornas  <dig> b and  <dig> might target the insertion site detected in both embryo and brain specimens  <cit> . the regulation of the function of the 3′ utrs are dependent on a combination of the primary and secondary structures of the rna sequences that form regulatory motifs  <cit> . presence of the insertion site in the 3′ utr of wdr <dig> would also affect secondary structure formation  <cit> . taken together, these possible mechanisms might be contributing to the regulation of different protein levels among tissues and altering the function of wdr <dig> 

our spatial expression study demonstrated that the expression of wdr <dig> is ubiquitous with enriched expression in brain and eye, which is consistent with the human and mouse studies  <cit> . wdr <dig> expression at six embryonic stages showed ubiquitous expression at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hpf timepoints. the signal was stronger in the optic vesicle and the midbrain at the 18 hpf timepoint. the signal was condensed in the lens, diencephalon, midbrain, and medial longitudinal fascicle at 48 hpf . the medial longitudinal fascicle is the axon tract which has an important role in coordination of conjugate eye movements. the diencephalon is composed of the rudiments of the thalamus, hypothalamus and the optic cups. the optic cups give rise to the neural part of the retina. the dentate axons, which leave the cerebellum, intersect at the fiber tracts of the superior cerebellar peduncle in the posterior midbrain  <cit> . taking into consideration that cerebellum and the eye regions are the common expression sites in human and mouse, our findings in developing wild type zebrafish show relevant results in the eye and brain regions.

the spatial expression studies of wdr <dig> gave additional information about putative cellular phenotypes and function in addition to the regional specificity throughout the brain and eye. our data indicated based on the expression pattern of wdr <dig> in the cells of the purkinje cell layer, retinal layers, and optic tectum, as well as being observed in the optic nerve and other fibers in the brain, that this gene is associated with multiple neuronal phenotypes in the embryo and adult. it is likely not associated with glia during development because the expression pattern is highest and ubiquitously distributed before gliogenesis begins at 22 hpf  <cit>  and the expression pattern is decreased and more specifically localized with neuronal phenotypes at that timepoint. in the adult, the morphology of the cells appears to be neuronal in nature not glial suggesting a neuronal phenotype as well. however, future studies should be directed at determining the exact neuronal types  in embryos and adults. in terms of the developmental pattern of neurogenesis in the zebrafish, it starts around 10 hpf with synaptogenesis beginning at 18 hpf  <cit> . our data demonstrating that wdr <dig> peaks at 18 hpf suggests that this gene maybe playing a role in continued neuronal proliferation, migration and survival in embryos. interestingly, we observed a pattern of expression of wdr <dig> in the adult that was strongly associated with proliferative zones in the zebrafish  <cit> . this association strongly suggests that this gene may have a role in neuronal proliferation, migration, and survival in the adult. this would be consistent with the predicted role of this gene in the brain  <cit> . taken together this evidence strongly suggests the function of wdr <dig> 

our temporal expression study demonstrated that the expression of wdr <dig> at 1 hpf, 5 hpf and 18 hpf timepoints is higher than the expression at 10 hpf, 24 hpf, 48 hpf, 72 hpf, 5 dpf, 15 dpf and 35 dpf timepoints . zygotic expression starts at 3 hpf in zebrafish  <cit> . relative expression analysis of ten developmental stages demonstrated that expression of wdr <dig> is high both before and after zygotic expression, indicating that wdr <dig> is maternally supplied. the  <dig> and 18 hpf timepoints are critical developmental stages with regard to wdr <dig> expression since these timepoints are after zygotic expression starts. presumptive brain, which appears at the sphere stage  already exists at the 5 hpf timepoint and the brain structure, which appears at the segmentation stage  has been formed at the 18 hpf timepoint  <cit> . our whole mount in situ hybridization data also confirmed our results of the qrt-pcr study. the intensity of the signal weakened after 18 hpf timepoint. we observed that signals obtained from wdr <dig> rna probe are high at the early developmental stages , then it decreases and is maintained at decreased levels during the rest of the evaluated timepoints . signals are enriched in the head at  <dig> and 48 hpf timepoints . having the zygotic expression of wdr <dig> the highest at  <dig> and 18 hpf and observing the signal of rna probe high in the brain regions and eye at  <dig> and 48 hpf timepoints also suggests that wdr <dig> might be a critical gene in neurodevelopment as reported previously  <cit> . gene knock-down studies with antisense morpholinos, based on our findings reported in this study are currently being performed in order to understand the potential functional role of wdr <dig> during development.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we aimed at fully characterizing the structure of the zebrafish wdr <dig> transcript, detecting the presence/absence of possible transcript variants and revealing its temporal and spatial expression in zebrafish. we observed that zebrafish wdr <dig> encodes one orf, the transcript has one 5′ utr and the sequence of 3′ utr confirms the prediction along with a detected 266 bp long insertion site in 24 hpf embryo and adult brain. the insertion site is detected in most of the evaluated tissues, however, it was not detected in kidney, intestine and gills, which might be indicating a possible alternative polyadenylation process among tissues. wdr <dig> is ubiquitously expressed among adult tissues and enriched in the eye and brain in early developmental stages. the  <dig> and 18 hpf are critical timepoints of development regarding wdr <dig> expression corresponding to peak changes in neurogenesis. presumptive brain and the brain structure have already formed at these timepoints, respectively. the signal of the rna probe was stronger in the eye and the midbrain at 18 hpf and was condensed in the lens, diencephalon, midbrain, and medial longitudinal fascicle at 48 hpf, which dropped down at 72 hpf. in the adult the wdr81-positive cells appeared to have a neuronal phenotype based on morphology and the expression was regionally specific with an association in neurogenic regions. taken together these data indicate the importance of the gene during neurodevelopment and adulthood with a possible role in neuronal proliferation, migration, and survival. future studies are ongoing to determine the functional role of wdr <dig>
