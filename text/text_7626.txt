BACKGROUND
during pathogenesis, it is advantageous for a pathogen to adjust to the shifting selective pressures exerted by the host. depending on the environmental milieu there may be strong selection for specific pathogenic phenotypes such as virulence or attenuation acquisition. these phenotypic shifts may be achieved through sexual reproduction where novel recombinations often lead to genome diversity  <cit> . however for many multi-stage pathogens, this cannot occur during haploid life stages and thus, they depend on genomic mutations or adaptations through non-mutational mechanisms such as phenotypic variation. mutations associated with virulence  are frequently documented in eubacteria  <cit>  and viruses  <cit> . however, there is a significant gap in knowledge of virulence-associated gene mutations in protozoa, including pathogens that have major impact on global public and animal health. with increased emphasis on the development and delivery of vaccines for hemoparasites such as babesia, theileria, and plasmodium spp.  <cit> , the ability to predictably and stably attenuate pathogens would be a significant step toward disease control strategies.

babesia bovis is a tick-borne apicomplexan protozoan responsible for causing bovine babesiosis  <cit> . virulent strains are capable of inducing cerebral babesiosis where >90% of erythrocytes sequestered in cerebral capillaries are infected with b. bovis parasites. the resulting neurovirulent phenotype is clinically similar to cerebral malaria caused by p. falciparum <cit> . in nature, there is a wide diversity of b. bovis virulent phenotypes  <cit>  but experimentally, attenuation can be predictably induced in vivo by serial passages of virulent b. bovis in a splenectomized host. the phenotypic characteristic of neurovirulence is gradually lost, and an attenuated derivative is obtained. animals infected with the attenuated derivative are protected upon virulent parental challenge, indicating that determinants of virulence may be modulated independently of epitopes responsible for protective immunity. the absence of the spleen during the attenuation process represents a change in the host environment and subsequent change in selection pressure. although the mechanism of attenuation is undetermined, one plausible explanation is that circulating parasites are not cleared as they would be in spleen-intact animals, resulting in the sequential enrichment of a non-virulent parasite subpopulation.

recent genomic comparison between three virulent and attenuated b. bovis strain pairs indicate that there are no consistent changes among the protein-coding genes shared between strain pairs that could explain the divergent phenotypes. however, an overall genome reduction in all three attenuated strains was observed  <cit> . these data suggest that  differences between parental and derivative strain pairs may lie in the non-coding regions which influence transcriptomic variability between virulent and attenuated strains,  the loss of genome content during the attenuation process is the key to attenuation, or  both.

in this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of two geographically unrelated b. bovis strain pairs to determine if attenuation is a result of common or distinct strain-specific transcriptomic regulation. although both b. bovis strains were subjected to identical treatment/selection pressure for attenuation acquisition, transcriptome profiles of these two strains through attenuation were different. detailed discussion of differential gene expression in their contribution to attenuation is discussed.

RESULTS
t2bo and l <dig> transcriptome approaches
in order to determine if virulence loss is controlled at the transcriptional level, we compared the global transcriptomes of two strain pairs of b. bovis. these strain pairs, t2bo_virulent parent and attenuated derivative and l17_virulent parent and attenuated derivative, are geographically distinct field isolates from mexico and argentina, respectively  <cit> . biological replicate  sample pairs were prepared for transcriptomic analyses. for the generation of br samples, animals were inoculated with 1 ×  <dig> parasitized erythrocytes. when clinical symptoms associated with acute babesiosis were observed and blood smears detected parasitemia, infected blood was collected to establish short-term  culture to obtain sufficient starting material for rna extraction . using the published t2bo genome , we generated an expression microarray that represented > <dig> % of the protein-coding genes to investigate transcriptome differences between t2bo_v and _a. due to the incomplete l <dig> genome, l17_v and _a transcriptome comparison was performed by rna-sequencing. the utilization of the t2bo genome-based microarray for l <dig> transcriptome investigation would reflect gene expressions shared between t2bo and l <dig> and exclude l17-specific transcripts as gene family member variations are known to exist between different b. bovis strains  <cit> .

expression microarray analysis of b. bovis t2bo transcriptomes
two independently produced biological replicates  were used to prepare for the virulent and attenuated samples in the microarray analysis while a third br sample pair was used for assay validation. the microarray data reveal the total number of detectable transcripts ranged from  <dig> to 89% of all predicted transcripts depending on the br samples . both biological replicate sample pairs were highly correlated with coefficient of determination  trimmed signal values between both br sample pairs to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

*student t-test, p < .01; de, differentially expressed.

microarray-based transcriptome analysis indicated that  <dig> genes in br <dig> and  <dig> were differentially regulated at significant levels  between v and a strain pairs . this equates to  <dig> % of the total detectable transcripts within the genome. among them,  <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated in the virulent  parent and its attenuated  derivative, respectively . seventy three percent of the transcripts upregulated in t2bo_v were variant erythrocyte surface antigen  genes followed by genes encoding for unspecified putative membrane proteins at 14% . ves is the largest gene family in b. bovis and encodes the variant erythrocyte surface antigen - <dig> in which divergently oriented ves α and β are hypothesized to be transcribed at the locus of active transcription, resulting in the expression of a vesa <dig> αβ heterodimer on the erythrocyte surface  <cit> . microarray data reveal that seven and eight ves α and β genes, respectively, were upregulated in t2bo_v and among them, three α and β are paired in divergently oriented manner as described previously  <cit> . al-khedery and allred showed that divergently oriented ves α and β are transcriptionally regulated coordinately and that they function in antigenic variation and cytoadhesion. ves genes that are not oriented in the same manner may act as donor sequences in segmental conversion. interestingly, although there were upregulated ves α and β genes in t2bo_a as well, none of them  are paired in divergently oriented manner on the chromosomes. based on this finding, it is plausible to hypothesize that  transcription of ves α and β divergently oriented pair might be impaired in t2bo_a or  that parasites expressing divergently oriented ves α and β may not be numerous enough for their transcripts to be detected by the array approach in the samples. nonetheless, either scenario may contribute to the observed lack of neurovirulence in animals in animals infected with t2bo_a.

in addition to ves genes that were upregulated in both parental virulent and attenuated t2bo, two  smorf  genes were upregulated in t2bo_v while  <dig> smorf  were upregulated significantly in t2bo_a . smorf is the second largest gene family with  <dig> members in t2bo  <cit> . although the function of the smorf proteins is unknown, the proximity of these genes with ves led to speculation that their expression may be coordinated with ves’ <cit> . however, since only two smorfs but  <dig> ves genes in t2bo_v, and  <dig> smorfs but five ves genes in t2bo_a, were upregulated, and none of the smorf gene locations were associated with those of ves, smorf gene transcriptional regulation may be independent from ves after all. the higher frequency of upregulated smorf gene transcripts in t2bo_a is noteworthy, but its transcription in b. bovis is likely to be independent of the virulence/attenuation phenotype .

additional differentially regulated genes in t2bo  were those encoding for hypothetical proteins, putative membrane proteins, spherical body protein   <dig> truncated copies  and 1-deoxy-d-xylose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase   . hypothetical and putative membrane proteins are two protein groups whose transcripts were found to be upregulated in the virulent and attenuated strains, though none of the specific protein group members were common between t2bo_v and _a. sbp <dig> truncated copies were exclusively upregulated in t2bo_a by as much as  <dig> fold  as compared to t2bo_v . these transcripts belong to the sbp <dig> gene family which encodes a large parasite-derived, exported protein that resides on the cytoplasmic side of the infected cell  <cit> . sbp <dig> is babesia-specific  <cit>  and is valuable in diagnostic procedures in suspected babesia-infected cattle  <cit> . sbp <dig> and its family members’ functions are currently unknown  and its upregulation in additional babesia will reinforce its contribution in attenuation acquisition . doxpr transcript was validated to be significantly upregulated in t2bo_a using a different br sample pair from those used to generate the microarray data. doxpr is a critical component in the non-mevalonate pathway  in the b. bovis apicoplast lumen  <cit> . this pathway is conserved among apicoplast-containing apicomplexans and consists of six major participants in addition to doxpr. although doxpr was upregulated significantly in t2bo_a , none of the other mep participants’ transcripts were upregulated in t2bo_a. this was unexpected and one could only speculate doxpr upregulation in t2bo_a may be involved in a pathway other than mep in this attenuated strain and its regulation is irrelevant to virulence loss in babesia. further evidence supporting such implication comes from the rna-sequencing analysis in l17_a which will be discussed later in the study.

nd, not detected to be significantly upregulated; *, fold changes is in reference to the respective virulent parental strains.

among the randomly selected transcripts chosen for microarray data validation in this study , 70% confirmed significant differential regulation while 20% showed differential regulation but were not statistically significant and one transcript showed the opposite trend from the array data  . including additional validated genes   <cit> , greater than 95% of randomly chosen transcripts were validated suggesting that the microarray assessment of the t2bo virulent and attenuated transcriptome profiles is representative. one possible explanation to why we were unable to validate a small percentage differentially expressed transcripts may be due to sample pairs used in br preparation are not clonal, thus may exhibit population variability. transcripts whose differential expression profiles are not shared between biological replicates may not contribute in the attenuation process.

rna-sequencing analysis on b. bovis l <dig> transcriptomes
to investigate if specific differentially expressed transcript profile of one b. bovis strain pair  is also observed in a geographically unrelated strain pair, transcriptomic profile of an additional b. bovis  strain pair was obtained. three thousand six hundred and thirty-one transcripts were detected using illumina-based rna-sequencing technique  and compared between l17_v and _a br samples . correlation plots using counts per million  of the three brs ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and reflect minimal bias in sample preparation . with p value set at 1x10- <dig> as before, four hundred eighty-four transcripts showed significant differentially expression between the l17_v and _a samples. these differentially expressed transcripts were further scrutinized by selecting for those whose |logfc| value was greater than  <dig>  , reducing the total number of significant upregulated transcripts in b. bovis l17_v and _a to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . absolute log fold changes  of these differentially expressed transcripts ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . eight highly differentially regulated genes were chosen for validation using an independently prepared br l <dig> sample pair . the number of transcripts chosen for validating the rna-sequencing results is consistent with previous studies  <cit>  and validation results corroborated with the rna-sequencing data. detectable differentially expressed transcripts reported by the array were approximately 3x fewer than those by rna-sequencing . two possibilities may account for the difference. first, rna-sequencing technology is known to be superior at detecting lower transcript levels than microarray  <cit> . second, there are more differentially expressed transcripts in the l <dig> strain pairs. in this study, it is likely that heightened sensitivity of rna-sequencing is the reason why more differentially expressed transcripts were detected in the l <dig> strain pairs. this high sensitivity of rna-sequencing technology was able to detect approximately 97% of the total predicted transcripts in the b. bovis genome. this implies that b. bovis asexual stages utilize a large proportion of the predicted protein encoded genes. this, however, does not suggest that these transcripts are important exclusively for the asexual stages, with 3% of the remaining protein encoded transcripts used for other stages. majority of the detected transcripts in both the virulent and attenuated strain pair  are likely used in stages other than the asexual stages as they were not statistically and significantly different in their regulation between the strain pair.

included among the  <dig> upregulated genes in l17_v were genes encoding for hypothetical proteins , smorfs , vesa <dig> , hexose transporters  and other miscellaneous proteins  . approximately seven percent  of the total upregulated genes in l17_v were also upregulated in t2bo_v. these were four ves , two smorfs  and a hypothetical protein-encoding gene . two of these upregulated ves transcripts in l17_v  form a ves αβ “lat” pair. the remaining upregulated virulent-associated ves  shared between t2bo and l <dig> virulent strains were not paired in a divergently oriented manner which are referred to as singletons. also interestingly is that only a single ves divergently oriented αβ pair was detected to be significantly upregulated in l17_v as opposed to three upregulated divergently oriented ves αβ pairs in t2bo_v. as mutually exclusive transcription of this gene family occurs  <cit> , the detection of three ves αβ pairs may suggest that the parasites which eventually express these “functional” vesa <dig> heterodimers represent the dominant members within the heterologous t2bo virulent population while the detection of a single ves αβ pair in l17_v sample may imply that only one dominant parasite which expresses functional vesa <dig> αβ is present within the l <dig> virulent population. if divergently oriented ves αβ pair’s transcription and subsequent expression are associated with virulence severity, then t2b0_v may be more virulent than l17_v. this datum may also suggest that l17_v contains a less diverse population than t2bo_v. unpaired ves α/β subunits, regardless of their expression in virulent or attenuated l <dig> strain, may still contribute to antigenic variability through segmental gene conversion  <cit> . the higher mean frequency of upregulated ves in l17_v than t2bo_v, regardless of paired or singleton status, is likely to be due to greater sensitivity of the rna-sequencing technique . furthermore, there is a possibility that the failure of observing any putative “functional” ves αβ transcripts in both attenuated strains could be due to these parasites being sequestered within capillaries as peripheral blood was collected for the preparation of sample pairs  <cit> .

the pattern of differential expression of smorf genes in the two strains is unique to each strain. there were fewer upregulated smorf genes in t2bo_v than in l17_v with little overlap between the strains, suggesting that subsequent smorf proteins may not play a significant role in the virulence phenotype .

among the genes encoding proteins that were significantly upregulated in l17_a , hypothetical , putative membrane , smorf  and vesa <dig>  remain the major groups  with  <dig> % of the  <dig> of the total upregulated genes in l17_a also upregulated in t2bo_a. as similarly found in the t2bo_a transcriptome profile, the upregulated hypothetical and putative membrane protein encoding genes likely participate in strain-specific activities. their involvement in virulence loss is still possible but this idea is further dampened by the fact that some of these l17_a-associated upregulated genes were found to be upregulated in t2bo_v  .

genes encoding for sbp <dig> truncated copies  were upregulated in both attenuated strains . specifically, sbp <dig> truncated copies  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were upregulated in t2bo_a while truncated copies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated in l17_a. this makes sbp <dig> truncated copies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> upregulated in both attenuated strains . multiple sequence alignments of sbp2_ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indicated that they share extremely high sequence homology  and thus sbp2_ <dig> that was upregulated in t2bo_a could potientially be substituted by sbp2_ <dig> and  <dig> in l17_a. again, exactly how the truncated copies participate in sbp2’s function and why their upregulation may contribute to virulence loss are unknown. sbp <dig> has been reported to reside in the cytoplasmic side of the infected erythrocytes. it is possible that this protein family interacts with either parasite- or host-derived proteins, a scenario not foreign to the apicomplexan field . perhaps upregulation of sbp <dig> family genes and subsequent overexpression of the proteins disrupt the normal matrix of protein-protein interaction, resulting in virulence loss. experiments investigating into such a phenomenon are currently underway.

in addition to transcripts described above, some miscellaneous transcripts encoding proteins were exclusively upregulated in l17_a by at least  <dig> fold. these include transcripts encoding for nifu-domain contain protein, hesb-domain containing protein, had hydrolase, u6-snrna associated sm-like lsm <dig> protein and oxidoreductase nad-binding domain containing protein . nifu-domain containing proteins perform basic cellular functions and are among the most highly conserved proteins  <cit> . hesb-domain containing proteins participate in the formation of metallo-sulfur cluster assembly  <cit> . had hydrolases function in housekeeping detoxification, modulation of sugar-phosphate balance in plants  <cit>  while u6-snrna associated sm-like lsm <dig> proteins have been reported to be involved in rna processing and may function in a chaperone-like manner in eukaryotes  <cit> . lastly, oxidoreductase nad-binding proteins are known to be enrolled in both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism which include glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid  cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism  <cit> . as all these transcripts were solely upregulated in l17_a and not in t2bo_a, we hypothesize that these transcripts and subsequent proteins, if translated, likely function in processes unrelated to virulence loss.

it was unexpected and disappointing that none of the differentially regulated transcripts with some annotation data involved in immune evasion, infection or reproduction efficiency were detected. this, by no means, suggests that such transcripts were not involved as they may be one of the putative membrane or the hypothetical proteins that were differentially regulated in both strains.

CONCLUSIONS
two b. bovis strain pairs  were used to investigate if virulence loss in protozoans is controlled at the transcriptional level through common strategies. for this study, we utilized a virulent parental phenotype and its attenuated derivative of each strain. we developed and independently validated data generated from an expression microarray for t2bo and rna-sequencing for l <dig>  the latter of which yielded three times more differentially regulated genes in the l <dig> strain pair. we attribute this difference to the heightened sensitivity of rna-sequencing. although some differentially expressed transcript families between the two strains were shared, the majority of the specific differentially expressed members were different, suggesting that strain-specific members within common gene families may participate in virulence loss.

we identified upregulation of ves αβ pairs in both virulent strains and hypothesize that these “actively and transcriptionally coordinated” ves αβ pairs expressed in the virulent strains may contribute to the virulence phenotype. this is consistent with our previous study where we showed that additional in vivo serial passage is required to attenuate t2bo than l <dig> and more severe clinical pathologies are associated with animals infected with t2bo_v than those infected with l17_v, all suggest that t2bo may be more virulent than l <dig>  <cit> . specifically, we identified more divergently oriented and actively transcribed αβ pairs in t2bo_v than l17_v and speculated that t2bo may be a more heterologous b. bovis population with higher virulence than l <dig>  the observation that none of the putative αβ pairs were shared between the two virulent strains could simply mean that different strains utilize different ves αβ pairs for the same function.

we also demonstrated that genes encoding for sbp <dig> truncated copies were significantly upregulated in both attenuated strains, and among these, the specific genes sbp2_ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated in both. we speculated that sbp <dig> truncated copies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were not shared, may be used substitutively by the parasite strains in attenuation. although function of sbp <dig> is not known, we hypothesized that the upregulation of sbp <dig> truncated copies may result in the over expression of the proteins and affect binding partners in the cytoplasm of the infected erythrocytes.

there were additional upregulated transcripts with limited annotational information but they were all strain specific in their expression and may not contribute to the phenotype change due to attenuation.

in summary, our study demonstrates that two b. bovis strains underwent identical manipulation/exposure to selection eventually resulting in virulence loss. despite some similar gene expression profiles shared between the two attenuated derivatives, much of the differential gene regulation is strain specific. outcome of this study demonstrates the independent adaptation of individual b. bovis strains to similar environmental milieu. these data raise further questions inquiring into the composition of the virulent parental strains. ongoing experiments exploring population dynamics of these virulent b. bovis are currently underway.
