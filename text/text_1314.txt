BACKGROUND
many common chemotherapeutic drugs are limited in their effectiveness due to side effects such as peripheral neuropathy. this is particularly problematic for use of otherwise highly effective anti-neoplastic agents, such as platinum analogues or taxane family members, as the effects are often dose or treatment regime limiting. the neurotoxic effects can be severe and significantly affect quality of life, even long after the treatment has ceased  <cit> . even though there is often some regeneration, this is slow and in many instances the reversal of the neuropathy is incomplete and can affect quality of life and normal function for many years.

the platinum analogue cisplatin  has been used chemotherapeutically for nearly  <dig> years and is one of the most widely used cytotoxic drugs  <cit> . cisplatin is directly taken up by sensory nerves. although cisplatin produces its anti-neoplastic effects by binding directly to dna, resulting in cross-linking and production of apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells  <cit> , as neurons are post-mitotic, the mechanism by which it induces neuropathy is not clear. while it does appear to induce apoptosis in sensory neurons  <cit> , early stages involve axonal loss but not necessarily cell loss and has been proposed to involve a disturbance of cytoplasmic/axonal transport  <cit> .

many compounds have been tested to try to block or reverse these chemotherapy induced neuropathies, with variable success. these include neurotrophic or neuroprotective factors, such as nerve growth factor   <cit> , insulin-like growth factor- <dig>   <cit> , erythropoietin  <cit>  and leukaemia inhibitory factor   <cit> , all of which showed some limited improvement in a variety of models. their clinical use is however limited due to difficulties in drug administration, stability, deleterious side effects or ineffectiveness in human clinical trials  <cit> . antioxidants such as glutathione  <cit>  and vitamin e  <cit>  and neuroprotective compounds such as acetyl-l-carnitine  <cit>  have also shown some effectiveness in protecting against chemotherapy induced neuropathy in preliminary studies. however, to date, there is no compound that will reliably prevent or reverse such neuropathies.

phenoxodiol  is an isoflavone analogue derived from genistein, which shows greater bio-availability and increased potency than its parent compound. it is showing promise as an experimental chemotherapeutic drug  <cit>  and is currently undergoing phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of hormone-resistant cancers. it induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines  <cit>  by modulation of a number of apoptotic pathways including activation of caspase  <dig> and bid signalling and inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein xiap  <cit> . it also shows anti-angiogenic properties  <cit>  and anti-proliferative properties by inducing g <dig> arrest by loss of cyclin dependent kinase  <dig> activity and induction of p <dig> waf1/cip <dig>  <cit> . while it shows cytotoxicity by itself, it also sensitises cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel  <cit> , allowing chemotherapy resistant tumours to become responsive. pxd thus has a range of biological effects and more are likely when examined in different cells and in different contexts.

in the current study the potential for pxd to protect against cisplatin induced neuropathy was assessed. using an in vitro model, pxd at sub-toxic concentrations was shown to be effective at blocking cisplatin induced neurite toxicity in the neuronal pc <dig> cell line. this suggests that in addition to its antineoplastic properties, pxd has the potential to protect against cisplatin induced neuropathy.

methods
pc <dig> cell culture
pc- <dig> cells were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle media  with 10% calf serum , 5% horse serum  and 1% penicillin/streptomycin  at 37°c, in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere. differentiation into neurons was achieved by seeding cells at a density of  <dig>  cells/well in 24-well plates , on  <dig> mm glass cover slips  coated with laminin  and poly-dl-ornithine  in dmem plus 1% horse serum and  <dig> ng/ml of nerve growth factor  . the cells were incubated for  <dig> hours under differentiation conditions, as previously described  <cit>  before use in the neurite outgrowth assays below.

cisplatin and pxd treatments
cisplatin  and pxd were provided by novogen. they were dissolved in dmso and stocks maintained at -20°c. working concentrations were diluted in pc <dig> cell differentiation medium as above. control conditions contained dmso diluted as for the drug conditions.

combination treatments consisted of a  <dig> hour incubation in differentiation media with various combinations of strong or moderate doses of cisplatin  and three doses of pxd  as described in the results section. recovery treatments consisted of treating differentiated cells with either dose of cisplatin for  <dig> hours. after this period, the cells were allowed to recover for  <dig> hours in fresh differentiation media. finally, three concentrations of pxd were added  for a further  <dig> hours to assess whether pxd could rescue the neurites from the cisplatin induced damage.

immunocytochemistry
following the treatment period, cells were washed with pbs, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with ice-cold methanol. neurons were immunostained for the neuronal marker βiii-tubulin  and a cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody  was used to visualise the staining.

neurite counting
outgrowing projections were considered neurites if they were greater than a cell body width , essentially as previously described  <cit> . images of all neurons in thirty randomly selected fields were digitally captured using an olympus bx <dig> fluorescence microscope with a uplanfl 40x/ <dig>  objective lens and a zeiss axiocam hrc digital camera and zeiss axiovision  <dig>  software. neurons in all fields were counted per condition and the number of cells with neurites expressed as a percentage of total cells present and error expressed as the standard error of the mean . each experiment was conducted in triplicate and the results pooled. statistical significance of data was analysed using anova followed by the bonferroni post-hoc test.

further analysis was conducted on the combination treatments, where the longest neurite per neuron present in each frame was measured using image j open source software .

RESULTS
determination of drug doses
optimal treatment concentrations cisplatin that caused neurite damage were determined by treating differentiated pc <dig> cells for  <dig> hours with serial dilutions of the drug. the concentration which caused the greatest reduction in the percentage of cells with neurites, without killing the cells, was chosen as a strong dose. a moderate dose was also selected, where the drug reduced neurite outgrowth by approximately 50% of the strong dose. the strong dose of cisplatin was selected as  <dig> μg/ml , which reduced the percentage of cells with neurites by  <dig> %, and the moderate dose of  <dig> μg/ml  caused a  <dig> % reduction in percentage of cells with neurites . the chosen concentrations did not produce cytotoxicity .

a serial dilution was also conducted for pxd to determine the concentration which would not affect normal growth of the differentiated cells. in addition to the maximal concentration tested that did not affect survival of pc <dig> cells , two other concentrations were selected for treatments, one log above  and one log below . doses up to  <dig> μm had no effect on cell death or neurite outgrowth , although a  <dig> μm concentration showed considerable cytotoxicity .

effect of pxd in blocking cisplatin neurite toxicity
to determine whether pxd could block cisplatin induced neurite toxicity, three different concentrations of pxd were added to cells in combination with cisplatin at the concentrations determined above to produce strong or moderate neurite toxicity. pxd had no effect on percent neurites at  <dig> nm or  <dig> μm but showed significant neurite toxicity at  <dig> μm  . this neurite toxicity was exacerbated in combination with cisplatin, with increased toxicity compared to pxd at  <dig> μm alone  .

although in the initial dose response experiments cisplatin at  <dig> μg/ml produced a modest neurite toxicity, this was not robustly observed when subsequent experiments were performed  . consequently, although there appeared to be a slight protection by pxd, this was not significant by anova, although comparison of cisplatin  <dig> μg/ml with cisplatin  <dig> μg/ml+pxd  <dig> μm was significant by t-test . robust neurite toxicity was observed with cisplatin at  <dig> μg/ml, with a 42% decrease in percent neurites compared to control . pxd blocked this neurite toxicity by approximately 50% at  <dig> nm  and  <dig> μm  .

effect on neurite length
to determine whether there were more subtle effects on neurite toxicity than could be measured by counting the percent of cells with neurite as above, the effect of cisplatin and pxd on neurite length was examined. the  <dig> μm concentration of pxd resulted in significant reductions in average neurite length compared to no treatment control, both alone  and in combination with cisplatin  . while cisplatin decreased the percentage of cells that had neurites , it had no significant effect on the average neurite length of the remaining neurites . interestingly, while pdx  or cisplatin alone had no effect on neurite length, the combination of these drugs increased neurite length compared to cisplatin alone , reflecting a blocking of cisplatin neurite toxicity. overall, the effect of pxd on blocking cisplatin effects on neurite outgrowth reflected the observations for the effects on percentage of cells with neurites.

effect of pxd in enhancing recovery from cisplatin neurite toxicity
co-administration of pxd with cisplatin blocked the cisplatin-induced neurite toxicity. to determine whether it could have an effect on recovery from cisplatin induced neurite toxicity by exacerbation, reversal, retardation or facilitation of repair, recovery experiments were performed. when conducting the recovery experiments, the concentrations of pxd tested were decreased by  <dig> log to  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm so that the highest concentration was below the toxic level. differentiated pc <dig> cells were incubated with cisplatin for  <dig> hrs as above, which was then washed off and the cells allowed to recover for  <dig> hrs before pxd was added for a further  <dig> hrs. addition of pxd at  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm or  <dig> μm had no effect on neurite outgrowth by themselves .

after  <dig> hrs of recovery, cisplatin showed no neurite toxicity at  <dig> μg/ml but greater than 50% toxicity at  <dig> μg/ml  compared to the no treatment control, indicating that the cells could not recover from this higher dose by  <dig> hrs after drug addition. pxd had no significant effect on recovery of neurite outgrowth following  <dig> μg/ml cisplatin treatment, although there was a slight enhancement of neurite outgrowth by pxd , following cisplatin at  <dig> μg/ml  . overall, pxd was protective for cisplatin induced neurite toxicity at concentrations of  <dig> nm to  <dig> μm when co-administered but not when administered after toxicity had already occurred.

discussion
pxd at low doses was able to significantly block neurite toxicity induced by cisplatin in the pc <dig> neuronal cell model. it did not however, affect recovery from cisplatin induced neurite toxicity, indicating that pxd needs to be administered prior to or concomitant with cisplatin to be effective.

the sensitivity of neurite toxicity to the protective effect of pxd was approximately  <dig> fold higher than the cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects observed in a variety of cancer cell lines. significant protective effects of pxd on neurite toxicity were observed at  <dig> μm, which is within the cytotoxic and anti-proliferative range of pxd in a range of cells including epithelial ovarian carcinoma, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and trophoblast cells  <cit> . however, significant neurite protective effects were also observed at a  <dig> fold lower concentration of pxd, which does not show robust effects on cancer cell viability  <cit>  or endothelial cell proliferation  <cit> . the  <dig> μm concentration of pxd was not toxic to the pc <dig> cells, unlike the ovarian cancer cell lines described  <cit> , although this concentration is also not toxic to normal ovarian surface epithelial cells  <cit> .

the ability of pxd to protect against cisplatin induced neurite toxicity is likely reflected in the mechanism by which it produces neurite toxicity. cisplatin is a dna binding drug and the amount of dna cross-linking correlates with cytotoxicity in cancer cells  <cit> , which are particularly susceptible due to high mitotic rate as well as a decreased ability to repair cisplatin-induced dna damage  <cit> . the dna binding of cisplatin also results in damage to a large number of genes  <cit> , which would have consequences for transcription and consequent general metabolism of the cell. how cisplatin specifically affects neurite outgrowth is as yet unknown but may be a result of general effects on signal transduction and signaling pathways altered because of dna damage.

post-mitotic sensory neurons such as dorsal root ganglia  neurons are also particularly susceptible to cisplatin binding  <cit>  and dna damage, although this can be rescued by administration of  <dig> ng/ml ngf  <cit> . similar to drg neurons, ngf also blocks cisplatin induced cytotoxicity of pc <dig> cells  <cit> . hence, in our study in which the pc <dig> cells were maintained in a differentiated state in the presence of ngf, we were able to isolate the effects of cisplatin on neurite toxicity from that of cytotoxicity. while the mechanism by which pxd blocked neurite toxicity is at this stage unknown, pxd has previously been shown to upregulate p <dig> waf1/cip <dig> in a range of cancer cell lines  <cit> . upregulation of p <dig> waf1/cip <dig> is however not only associated with cell cycle regulation, it is also a regulator of neurite outgrowth. in the pc <dig> cell model, as used in this study, upregulation of p <dig> waf1/cip <dig> promotes neurite outgrowth  <cit> . it also promotes neurite outgrowth in other neuronal cell lines and primary neurons  <cit> , promotes axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury in rats  <cit>  and regulates radial axon growth and motor function recovery following peripheral nerve injury  <cit> . therefore, pxd can actively upregulate a signal transduction pathway that is not only closely associated with mitotic arrest but also with neurite outgrowth.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, given the dose and treatment limiting neuropathic side effects of cisplatin, one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs and the lack of any currently available prophylactic treatment or cure, pxd is a promising candidate that warrants further testing. successful prophylactic treatment of cisplatin induced neuropathy with pxd could allow more intensive and hence more effective cisplatin therapy.
