BACKGROUND
neisseria spp. are gram-negative beta-protobacteria which include many species found only in humans. two neisseria spp. are pathogenic to human: n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae, responsible for bacterial meningitis and septicaemia, and gonorrhoea, respectively. in the last few years, the genomes of n. meningitidis serotypes a   <cit>  and b   <cit>  and n. gonorrhoeae   have been sequenced and annotated. as part of a structural proteomics approach to the study of pathogenic neisseria, we have solved the structure of the putative nitrogen regulatory protein iiantr of n. meningitidis  , the sequence of which is highly conserved amongst the neisseria spp.

in escherichia coli, the iiantr gene  is located within the sigma- <dig> factor coding operon, rpon, with which it is co-transcribed  <cit> . insertional mutagenesis of ptsn has been shown to suppress the conditional lethality of temperature sensitive era  mutants  <cit> . the era gene of e. coli encodes a gtpase which appears to be essential for cell growth  <cit> . iiantr is a member of the mannitol-fructose family of iia protein/domains which forms part of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system   <cit> . pts controls sugar uptake by bacteria through a series of phosphoryl transfer reactions in which the sugar-specific iia enzyme is phosphorylated on a highly conserved histidine residue by the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein, hpr  <cit> . in e. coli, the rpon operon also includes a gene encoding a protein related to hpr, designated npr; both hpr and npr have been shown to phosphorylate e. coli iiantr  <cit> . the sequence similarity between hpr and the molybdenum-iron protein of the nitrogenase complex of rhizobium trifolii  <cit>  and the frequent association of pts proteins with rpon have been taken to suggest that iiantr may provide a regulatory link between carbon and nitrogen assimilation in bacteria  <cit> .

the role of the nm-iiantr in neisseria has not been characterized, and the potential functions of these proteins in cellular behaviour are diverse  <cit> . the gene encoding this protein is not found in proximity to the equivalent of the e. coli rpon gene  nor is it close to the hpr-like protein . the structures of the e. coli iiantr  <cit>  and related iiamannitol  domain of pts  <cit>  have been solved by x-ray crystallography. more recently, a solution structure of a phosphoryl transfer complex between iiamtl domain and hpr has been described  <cit> . in this report, we compare the structure of the neisserial iiantr to the homologous e. coli enzymes and complex and discuss the functional implications of our findings.

RESULTS
expression and purification
the nm-iiantr was over-expressed in e. coli with an n-terminal his-tag which was removed prior to crystallization. mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein showed that it comprised a 60: <dig> mixture of mono-phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated protein. the conserved h <dig> in the protein was thus capable of phosphorylation by endogenous hpr/npr from the expression system. analyses of re-dissolved crystals of the protein by mass spectrometry showed that only the un-phosphorylated form of the protein was crystallized presumably due to labile nature of the phospho-histidine bond in the acidic crystallisation conditions,  <dig>  m sodium citrate, ph  <dig> .

overall structure
the model of nm-iiantr contains  <dig>  protein residues and  <dig> water molecules. residues  <dig> and 148– <dig> are not modelled in the structure due to lack of clearly defined electron density. the structure of nm-iiantr consists of a 5-stranded mixed β-sheet which is sandwiched by six α-helices, two on one side and four on the other . the overall fold, as expected from the sequence homology, is similar to that of e. coli iiantr  and iiamtl .  <dig> cαs out of  <dig> of e. coli iiantr  can be overlapped onto nm-iiantr with a root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å. the major differences between the neisserial and e. coli structures appear at surface loops linking the secondary structure elements, for examples α2–α <dig>  β3–β <dig> and β5-α <dig> loops , and the termini . the α <dig> is shorter and there is a one residue insertion at the α2–α <dig> loop in nm-iiantr. whilst comparison of e. coli iiamtl  with nm-iiantr gave  <dig> equivalent cαs with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å. e. coli iiamtl does not have the short α-helix at the n-terminus, but has a extra helix between β <dig> and β <dig>  residue insertions and deletions at α2–α <dig>  β3–β <dig> and β5-α <dig> loops have resulted in large structural differences at these places between the two proteins . similar differences between e. coli iiant and iiamtl have been noted  <cit> .

active site and interface with h-pr
the active site of nm-iiantr is located in a concave area of protein surface consisting of α3–α <dig> and β2–β <dig>  the active site residue, h <dig>  the equivalent of h <dig> in e. coli iiantr or h <dig> in e. coli iiamtl, is the fifth residue of β <dig> and is surrounded by hydrophobic residues l <dig>  i <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and a <dig> on one side, and by hydrophilic residues r <dig> and r <dig> on the other side . h <dig> and r <dig> are conserved amongst all iiantr and iiamtl proteins. h <dig> is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of l <dig> from its nd <dig> atom, while the nh <dig> atom of the r <dig> side-chain hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl groups of both g <dig> and itself; a similar pattern is also observed in e. coli iiantr. the side-chain of r <dig> is folded toward the active site h <dig> unlike the corresponding k <dig> of e. coli iiantr, which is folded away from the active site h <dig>  in the e. coli iiantr crystal structure there is a sulphate ion forming a salt bridge/hydrogen bonding interactions to the side-chains of both r <dig> and h <dig> in one molecule of the crystal asymmetric unit. interestingly, in our structure there is also a strong peak of electron density located on the 2-fold crystallographic axis, which could be modelled as a sulphate ion interacting with the side-chains of r <dig>  h <dig> and r <dig> via salt bridge/hydrogen bonding, as well as to the equivalent residues of the symmetry related molecule . the distance from the nd <dig> atom of h <dig> to the two-fold symmetry axis is  <dig>  Å, providing insufficient space to accommodate a phosphoryl group, consistent with the finding that only un-phosphorylated protein is found in the crystals by mass spectrometry.

in the active site of the e. coli iiamtl there is a second histidine residue  which is conserved amongst all iiamtl sequences  <cit>  and is proposed by analogy to the glucose pts to be essential for phosphoryl transfer to the next component in the cascade, iibmtl <cit> . h <dig> shows two side-chain configurations in both crystal and nmr structures  <cit>  either being parallel to and pointing away from, the active site h <dig> . these differing h <dig> conformations might be related to the two active site geometries required for the phosphoryl group accepting and donating functions of the protein  <cit> . the equivalent histidine, h <dig>  of nm-iiantr and h <dig> of e. coli iiantr has similar conformations and are located at the back of helix α <dig> pointing away from the active site. it is unlikely that this histidine can be repositioned at the active site by unwinding the helix and therefore it appears improbable that it play a role in phosphoryl transfer from iiantr to other proteins. the question arises as to whether another residue in the active site of nm-iiantr could play a role in phosphotransfer. intriguingly, r <dig> in nm-iiantr is positioned close to the active site and at a similar position to h <dig> of iiamtl . the structure therefore suggests mutagenesis experiments which could be carried out to investigate further the active site of the protein. more generally, it remains an open question as to how nm-iiantr is de-phosphorylated and whether this results in the phosphorylation of another protein. certainly in e. coli, iiantr cannot substitute for iiamtl in the pts mediated phosphorylation of mannitol  <cit>  and therefore cannot be de-phosphorylated as a consequence of transfer to iibmtl. since no iibntr component has been identified, it remains unclear what effectors iiantr proteins bind to and what role phosphorylation plays in this interaction.

by contrast, more is known about the protein that interact with iiantr to phosphorylate the protein. again, results from e. coli can be used to inform the likely situation in neisseria. thus phosphorylation of e. coli iiantr involves association with the phospho-transfer proteins hpr, as well as the related npr, and transfer of a phosphoryl group between histidine residues. hpr and npr are in turn phosphorylated by the upstream histidine kinases enzyme i  and eintr respectively, leading to the proposal that there are two parallel phosphoryl transfer chains in e. coli, with npr the preferential donor to iiantr  <cit> . interestingly in neisseria meningitidis, there is only one hpr-like protein, encoded by the gene nmb <dig>  the n. meningitidis hpr-like protein  shares 32% and 38% sequence identity with e. coli hpr and npr respectively. insight into how iia proteins bind to the upstream effectors has been obtained by nmr studies. a solution structure has been reported for the complex formed between e. coli hpr and iiamtl  showing that binding is achieved through a central core of hydrophobic contacts strengthened by a few hydrophilic interactions  <cit> . it is expected that the interactions between the two neisseria proteins should resemble the e. coli hpr and iiamtl complex. superimposing nm-iiantr onto e. coli iiamtl and aligning the hpr sequence with nm-hpr have indeed revealed common features of protein-protein interactions among the two systems. the key residues of the hydrophobic core of e. coli iiamtl involved in contacts with hpr are l <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig>  t <dig> and l <dig>  which correspond to residues l <dig>  v <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  a <dig> and f <dig> in nm-iiantr. the aromatic residue f <dig> of hpr makes most extensive interactions with the hydrophobic core, especially to i <dig> and l <dig> of e. coli iiamtl, whereas in neisseria the corresponding residues are m <dig> in nm-hpr, v <dig> and f <dig> in iiantr, an example of change in shape complementarity. however, since helix α <dig> of nm-iiantr is  <dig> residues longer and about 25° different in orientation compared to the same helix of e. coli iiamtl, one would anticipate that the nm-hpr could bind in a different orientation. more recently, nmr has been used to characterise the interaction between e. coli iiantr and n-pr  <cit> . chemical shift mapping identified the surface on iiantr for npr binding, which generally corresponds to the hpr -binding region of iiamtl but specifically implicates g <dig>  d <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig> and nearby residues in the interaction. the corresponding residues in nm-iiantr are g <dig>  n <dig>  s <dig> and e <dig>  with the region around g <dig> being the most highly conserved.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of nm-iiantr confirms its assignment as a homologue of the iiantr proteins found in a range of other gram-negative bacteria. in fact the overall fold of the neisseria enzyme shows a high degree of similarity to both the iiantr and iiamtl proteins from e. coli. further, the orientations of the two histidine residues in the active site region is conserved between the neisseria and e. coli iiantr proteins and is distinct from the iiamtl.

the availability of a second iiantr structure enables certain generalizations to be made. the effector mechanism of this sub-group of regulatory proteins is distinct from the iia components of the pts controlling sugar uptake, which involve a transfer of phosphate via histidine residues to a iib acceptor protein. the nature of the downstream effectors of iiantr proteins and the role of iiantrphosphorylation in the process remain to be established. in contrast, the mechanism of phosphorylation of all iia components appears to be broadly similar and involves inter-molecular transfer between histidine residues in a complex formed between hpr and iia proteins. in neisseria a single hpr-like protein appears to be responsible for phosphorylation of both iiantr and the iia components of the sugar pts whereas in e. coli, there is a parallel pathway involving the hpr-related protein npr. in e. coli, npr is expressed, with iia ntr and σ <dig>  from the rpon operon implying common regulation of gene expression. this is not the case in neisseria where these genes are found on different transcriptional units. therefore, although the structure of neisseria iiantr indicates that it is part of a similar phosphotransfer cascade to e. coli, details of the regulation of the gene are likely to be distinct.
