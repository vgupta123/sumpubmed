BACKGROUND
spermatozoa are produced in the testis as the result of a complex assembly line that makes a highly shaped cell, morphologically and biochemically specialized. these cells are released in the seminiferous tubules fluid and then begin a long journey by "floating" passively through the rete testis to leave the testis, entering the efferent ducts and thereafter moving to the unique epididymal duct. testicular spermatozoa are non functional, it is solely before reaching the end of the epididymis,  that they will acquire their physiological functions: the possibility of motility, of undergoing the post-ejaculatory events , the ability to recognize and to bind to the oocyte investments and plasma membrane, and in short their natural fertilizing ability  <cit> .

this post-testicular maturation results from changes in the sperm membrane composition and metabolism in response to the profound alterations of the surrounding fluid composition. the fluid components  are changing all along the different ducts through which the sperm transit  <cit> . it is now well established that the sperm changes are progressive and occur in a define order. among the main transformations, the changes in the sperm surface proteins have been extensively described  <cit> . a number of sperm surface components are removed or altered during the transit while others are added in relation with the fluid changes. some of these surface component changes have been involved in the sperm egg recognition but these components and therefore their mechanisms of modification are not "universal" since they are not found in all mammals   <cit> . moreover mouse knockout approaches to prove their role in fertilization has been found tedious since the absence of one component during spermatogenesis or sperm epididymal maturation may result in improper formation of specialized sperm membrane surface domains  <cit> . these strongly suggest that multispecies studies are necessary to better understand the common as well as species-specific mechanisms involved in the sperm maturation process and fertility.

the epididymal secretome and proteome of several mammalian species including pigs as well some of the mechanisms involved in the sperm surface alteration have been recently described  <cit> . the complete sequencing of several mammalian genomes and the possibility open by technologic progresses allow now analyzing the complete gene expression of a tissue by microarray. nowadays more than ten different transcriptomic studies of mouse, rat and human epididymis have been achieved  <cit> . these studies have shown that a large number of genes are expressed in the epididymis but only few genes were found specifically over-expressed in this organ compared to other tissues. meanwhile they have also showed that a high level of regionalization of the expression of part of these genes existed and that this gene expression  is tightly regulated by the hormonal status and also by very specific local mechanisms present either in the fluid within the tubule and/or may be by action from the embedded fluid surrounding the tubule in a specified zone delimited by the connective septae of the supporting tissue  <cit> . however, none of these studies have included a comparison with testicular gene expression and with the vas efferens and vas deferens transcriptomes and the human studies have been limited to the three gross morphological parts of the epididymis . here we have used a microarray approach to analyze the transcriptome of nine defined regions of adult fertile boar epididymis, efferent and deferent ducts and testis. these epididymal regions were chosen according to previous studies done on this species  <cit> .

pigs provide good model for biomedical research, as pigs and humans show in many aspects physiological, biochemical, pathological and pharmacological similarities. recently it has been demonstrated that the porcine and the human genome evolutionary distance is smaller than the distance between mouse and human  <cit> . for example a survey using a pig  <dig>  <dig> genes cdna microarray indicated that gene expression in common porcine tissues is very similar to the expression in homologous tissues of human  <cit> . this provides a rationale to use porcine sequences in gene expression comparisons with human in transcriptomic analysis. moreover, pig tissues are more easily available than their human counterparts and several pig microarrays have been made available to screen for genes involved in specific biological processes of interest such as diseases or development, but also related to the agronomical interest for this species  <cit>  since pigs are one of the most eaten animals in the world today and the pig industry will use more and more genetic selection based on the development of marker-assisted selection that rely on the mastering of artificial insemination techniques, including the sperm fertility.

this study then fulfill the gap between the rodent and human by addressing a domestic species with an agronomical interest where the epididymal duct measure more than  <dig> meters long and the transit of the sperm is at least three weeks.

we have used a microarray that was made from clones issued from a multi-tissue cdna normalized library including the testis and the three main gross regions  of the epididymis  <cit> . we have also adapted specific statistical methods to analyze the gene clustering and procedure to obtain genes that were over-expressed in specific transcriptomic units. our data showed the expression of several new genes in the epididymis and confirmed that very few epididymal specific genes existed. meanwhile a certain number of genes have a very tight expression in one or a few zones and then could be useful as markers for the epididymal activity and some of these genes will also certainly be good candidates to further understand the very specific biochemical processes involved in epididymal regionalization and to obtain fertile spermatozoa.

RESULTS
differentially expressed transcripts between  <dig> conditions
the extracted mrnas from the  <dig> different samples  and vas deferens ) were retro-transcribed in presence of 33p-labelled oligonucleotide and hybridized onto the nylon microarray spotted with pcr products from clones from a multi-tissues bank including reproductive tissues from male and female  <cit> . each pcr product contained also a short sequence used to estimate the quality of the membrane and to measure the quantity of each clone spotted. this last value was used to correct the signal after hybridization with the 33p-cdna.

after cleaning and digital processing of our array data, for each tissue sample only spots with at least  <dig> valid replicates were kept to estimate the intra-group variability. we then retained  <dig> valid spots throughout the  <dig> membranes and  <dig> samples studied.

in order to determine the differential expression of a transcript between the twelve different tissue samples, each was compared to the other for these  <dig> spots with a moderated f-test from the limma r package . between the  <dig> tissue samples,  <dig> transcripts showed a differential expression. at this step, we expected that the main housekeeping genes or the genes that were expressed at the same level in all the tissues tested have been removed from the analysis.

transcriptional units
we first analyzed how these  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts could classify our biological samples. a clustering of the  <dig> tissue conditions was then performed with the combinative use of the pam and the hac. the pam gives a graphic profile to help in the choice of the number of classes, which is a critical step in unsupervised methods . in this figure, the quality of the classification  is dependent on the number of classes chosen. the higher is the value of the mean silhouette width; the better is the quality of classification. in our case as it could be expected, the best fit was for two classes , but this was poorly informative from a physiological point of view. we then decided to retain the second best score with  <dig> classes. figure 2b shows how the arrays are clustered within these  <dig> classes with the score obtained for each array.

the result obtained by the hac analysis is shown in figure 2c. it was possible to find a threshold on the dendrogram to retrieve the  <dig> clusters grouping the same tissue arrays as the pam. by combining the results of these two methods, the  <dig> clusters that fit the best our data of gene expression correspond to:  the testis,  the efferent ducts,  the anterior caput of the epididymis ,  the median caput ,  the posterior caput ,  the corpus  and  the caudal region with the zone 8/ <dig> and the deferent duct. we also observed that some uncertainties exist for some arrays, certainly due to animal variations: one epididymal zone  <dig> membrane was classified in the posterior caput while some zone  <dig> membranes were clustered within the corpus unit instead in the posterior caput as expected.

co-expressed transcripts
with the combinative use of the pam and the hcl, we analyzed how many co-expression classes could be formed by the  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts . with the pam the best classification of co-expressed transcripts gave again two main clusters: the testicular transcripts versus the other tissues transcripts . the classification with the second best score gave  <dig> clusters. as shown in figure 2e, for each transcript a value was associated which represents how the transcript fits in the classes, the higher is the value the better this transcript is representative of this class. the hcl analysis showed also two main branches  and we were able with a threshold to separate  <dig> clusters identical to the pam . then the analysis of the transcripts co-expression defined four main classes:  the testis,  the head of the epididymis,  the corpus and  the efferent ducts and the caudal region . the heat map from the hcl  showed the intensity of each co-expressed transcripts within a cluster; some of them had only a very small differential expression or could have biphasic expression.

from these results, the identifier of each transcript from each cluster were used to build a contingency table to establish a list of robust transcripts classified the same way by the two different algorithms . among the  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts and the  <dig> tissue conditions,  <dig>  are clustered in the same way by the two statistical methods used. among them,  <dig>  transcripts have a preferential expression in the testis,  <dig>  in the head of the epididymis,  <dig>  in the corpus and  <dig>  in the efferent ducts and the caudal region .  <dig>  transcripts were not classified the same way by the two methods.

common transcripts are those clustered in the same way by the hcl and pam algorithms.

search for preferentially over-expressed transcripts between the  <dig> transcriptomic units
the clustering analysis has shown that our  <dig> tissue conditions formed  <dig> informative transcriptomic units. meanwhile the gene analysis showed only four classes of co-expressed genes. we then decided to dig further our data to determine which transcripts are preferentially over-expressed in only one of the transcriptional units. to do this, we used parwise moderated t-tests from the smvar package  <cit>  . we first searched iteratively for transcripts differentially expressed between  <dig> transcriptomic units with the pairwise moderated t-test, then for each unit, we selected over-expressed transcripts using the value of the logratio expression obtain during the test. then, we compared between units, the list of over-expressed transcripts and retained only those belonging to one single list. doing this, we selected, for each transcriptomic unit, transcripts that are preferentially over-expressed compared to the others. this was done on the  <dig> usable spots and the  <dig> informative transcriptomic units. the results of this test are summarized in figure 3:  <dig> unique transcripts have a preferential over-expression in one of these units.

meanwhile, because we knew that some genes could be expressed both in the testis and also in the epididymis , these genes may be eliminated by our analysis although they are over-expressed in one unit of the epididymis. the analysis was then redone in excluding the testis: we then found that  <dig> transcripts were over-expressed in only one of the  <dig> remaining units. we have also done the same approach excluding both the testis and the vas efferens that may have a partially different embryonic origin than the epididymis  <cit> , and found  <dig> transcripts over-expressed in one of the epididymal units.

because including the testis and the vas efferens in our analysis had consequence on numbers of transcripts retrieved as epididymal, we performed a second analysis on the  <dig> qualified spots without these tissues. the limma moderated f-test  gave  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed between the nine epididymal zones and the vas deferens. when we compared this new list with the list of differentially expressed transcripts between the  <dig> conditions, we observed that  <dig> transcripts were common and only  <dig> were new ones. the classification on the nine epididymal zones and the vas deferens was performed with  <dig> algorithms  gave  <dig> tissue clusters corresponding to  the anterior caput of the epididymis ,  the median caput ,  the posterior caput ,  the corpus  and  the caudal region  including the vas deferens. a clustering of co-expressed transcripts with the combinative use of the pam and the hcl on the  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts found only  <dig> clusters:  the head of the epididymis,  the corpus,  the caudal region.

a contingency analysis showed that  <dig> transcripts among the  <dig> are clustered in the same way by the  <dig> statistical approaches used. among them,  <dig> have a preferential expression in the head of the epididymis,  <dig> in the corpus and  <dig> in the caudal region .

search for potential markers 
numerous genes were found over-expressed in more than one tissue. as we were interested to find more specific genes and functions related to these genes, we decided to search for "markers". markers are then defined as transcripts that are over-expressed preferentially in the same transcriptomic unit where the clustering analysis classified them. by this way, we do not keep as markers transcripts that have a biphasic expression profile. by crossing the data, for the testis  <dig> potential markers were found, for the efferent ducts  <dig>  for the anterior head  <dig> , for the median head   <dig> potential markers, for the posterior head   <dig>  for the corpus   <dig> and for the cauda   <dig> transcripts .

validation of microarray by semiquantitative rt-pcr and real-time pcr
we have selected  <dig> different transcripts found as differentially expressed by the clustering analysis and then designed primers  and measured the relative amplicon intensities obtained after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cycles of rt-pcr amplification.

almost all transcripts were found effectively expressed within the transcriptomic unit assigned by the statistical approach . only for rap1a, which had a very low expression level on microarray, it was not possible to observe the differential expression by rt-pcr. this figure also confirms that some of the genes have a bi-phasic expression: they were both expressed in the testis and in one transcriptomic unit of the epididymis. these genes could then be found over-expressed in one unit when the statistical analysis was done on the twelve conditions but like crabp <dig> or awn, become part of an epididymal cluster when the analysis was done without the testis and the vas efferens . as control we also amplified two genes  that were not found in the common list of the two statistical approaches but had a statistically significant differential expression on microarray. again the results of microarray and rt-pcr were in agreements.

we also analyzed the beta 2-microglubulin  gene that was not found differentially expressed. the primers for this gene were designed in such way that they were on two successive exons. the rt-pcr showed only the waited amplicon of  <dig> bp  indicating also the absence of genomic dna contamination. as predicted this gene showed no differential expression by pcr whatever the number of pcr cycles.

among the transcripts, we have also chosen for each one of our transcriptomic units, one gene found as a marker by the statistical analysis , spp <dig>  tspan <dig>  cpe, awn). the expression of these genes was measured by the intensity of the amplicon on gel after rt-pcr on the twelve different tissues , and the validity of the statistical analysis compared after averaging the results to reproduce either the seven or the five transcriptomic units where these genes have proved to be over-expressed and classified . the expression level of these genes was also quantified by real-time pcr and all the results compared to the expression values from the microarray . all pcrs and microarrays results were in very close agreements. for mettl7b, which was found as a vas efferens marker, a slight discrepancy exists between the microarray and the pcr data. this difference came from the fact that among the four boars the one chosen for the pcr showed the highest expression in zone zero . meanwhile when the level of pcr expressions is mathematically pooled to reproduce the seven tissue clusters, this gene expression was clearly higher in the vas efferens compared to the proximal caput.

expression pattern of gene families of interest
among the transcripts found in the clusters, some of them belong to families that have been previously described in different epididymal studies. so, we further studied the expression pattern in boar of some of these genes and their related family genes found on our array.

a) lipocalins
several lipocalin family members have been described in the epididymis and found in the epididymal fluid  <cit> . we found that clones with related sequences to  <dig> known lipocalins  and one uncharacterized lipocalin  were spotted on the microarrays and showed a differential expression. we designed primers  and we compared the results of the microarrays hybridization and rt-pcr expression levels . we obtained a very good matching for apod, ptgds, lcn <dig>  lcn <dig>  lcn <dig>  while the differential presence of unq <dig> was observed in caput with a maximum in zone  <dig>  for ucal-p <dig>  a low signal was found all along the epididymis by pcr, suggesting a low level of expression for this gene and the differential expression could not be confirmed. we have also analyzed the lcn <dig> gene expression because this gene is also named uterocalin in database although there is no sequence homology with ucal-p <dig> . lcn <dig> expression was detected in boar epididymis but did not show a differential expression .

b) defensins
specific expression of a large number of defensins has been shown by previous epididymal transcriptomic studies  <cit> . the data mining of the clone sequences spotted on our pig microarray showed that at least  <dig> defensin genes were present and differentially expressed . the identity of each of these pig defensins was ascertained by sequence comparisons and cysteine positions and spacing . five of these defensins were already correctly described in pig  and two were miss-annotated . we also identified two new boar defensins homologous to defb <dig> and defb <dig> 

by rt-pcr, the  <dig> defensins were found exclusively expressed in the caput and corpus epididymis . defb <dig> is mainly restricted to the anterior caput  while spag11b_c, defb <dig>  defb <dig> genes had a high relative expression in that region with a smaller expression in the posterior caput . defb <dig> had a high relative expression in the caput through zones  <dig> to  <dig> . spag11b_e was expressed in all caput zones with a maximum in the posterior caput epididymis  while defb <dig>  was found mainly in corpus  with expression in adjacent zones .

c) whey acidic containing domain proteins 
like lipocalins and defensins, wap protease inhibitors have been found in epididymis  <cit> . we identified wfdc <dig>  wfdc <dig>  slpi and a new wap domain sequence that we named wfdc10a-like since it shows similarities to mouse and human putative protease inhibitor wfdc10a . wfdc <dig> was mainly expressed in the testis  while slpi was expressed in vas efferens and zone  <dig> . wfdc <dig> had a low expression in the testis and all along the epididymis including the vas deferens but with a highest level in the corpus and cauda . the wfdc10a-like gene showed a more restricted expression from the posterior caput to the vas deferens with a maximum in the distal corpus and cauda .

expression pattern of some new epididymal genes or genes not yet described in boar
a) new variants of known genes
several cystatins have been shown mainly expressed in epididymis and cystatin  <dig>  is an "epididymal specific" gene expressed in the caput and corpus region in mouse  <cit> . a variant with a deletion  has been suggested from "in silico" genomic sequence analysis but not shown in vivo  <cit> . we found two clones over-expressed in our microarray experiments with matching sequence with cst <dig> and one of these clones had a sequence deletion . we designed primers encompassing the deletion and the rt-pcr confirmed the presence of two amplicons at the expected sizes . the sequencing of these amplicons confirmed the existence of the two mrnas. we observed that although scst11Δ had a lower intensity than the full scst <dig>  both mrnas were present in the same zones with a same biphasic pattern of expression .

eg <dig>  was described in mouse epididymis as a specifically caput/corpus over-expressed gene  <cit> . dna sequence analysis suggested two possible peptide sequences by alternative rna splicing but only one mrna was analyzed in this previous study. we found two clones over-expressed showing both a different deletion when compared to the mouse sequence. we have ascertained the existence of both messengers by rt-pcr with specific primers and amplicon sequencing . we found that both mrna were equally expressed in posterior caput with a similar expression pattern .

b) new unreported genes in boar
among our over-expressed genes we choose two genes that were not previously observed in epididymis and four not yet described in boar.

spink5l <dig>  a kazal type serine protease inhibitor, is a marker of the corpus with a maximum intensity in zones  <dig> and  <dig> . mon1b, a new member of the sand protein family, was also expressed in the cauda . fxyd <dig>  the gamma subunit of the na, k-atpase, was found as a marker of the ve . gp <dig>  glycoprotein  <dig>  gene not yet described in epididymis, is highly expressed in the anterior caput in boar . muc <dig> is a novel mucin-like protein that is over-expressed in the boar caput epididymis . glb1l <dig> , is a new member of the galactosidase beta family. we found a high expression of this enzyme in the boar testis but also a differential expression in the epididymis with a maximum in corpus . for all of these genes we find a very good agreement between microarray over-expressions and rt-pcr results.

gene ontology
we have associated the proper go terms from the gene ontology consortium annotation categories for each gene  and generated a list of over-represented go terms using either the five transcriptomic clusters or only the three epididymal clusters. from this analysis, several over-represented categories were identified . as expected, and as a good internal control, "spermatogenesis" was one of the functions associated with the testis, as well "cell division" and "nucleus". 

similar gene expression in mammals
different epididymal transcriptomic studies have been done in mouse, rat and human. comparison of the data between rat and mouse have been made and showed the difficulties to compare the different zones of these two mammalians epididymis, even using similar microarray technology  <cit> . in human, the main study was done on three epididymal samples using the head, the corpus and the cauda epididymis but no anatomical description of this division was shown  <cit> .

however, we tried to compare our data with those of these three studies. we have first obtained the list of expressed genes in the different studies. one obstacle to this comparison was the low level of gene annotation in boar or homogeneity of genes annotation between species. to encompass this problem, we have transformed all the genes in their mus musculus homologous unigene ids. we searched transcripts that have their higher level of expression for the  <dig> species studied, in the same epididymal unit  or in segments corresponding to these units. for mouse, the  <dig> units were defined based on anatomical and clustering information given by johnston et al.,  <cit> . the caput was formed from segments  <dig> to  <dig>  corpus by segment  <dig> and the cauda segments  <dig> to  <dig>  for rat, the  <dig> units were defined from anatomical information given by jelinsky et al.,  <cit> . the caput was composed by segments  <dig> to  <dig>  the corpus by segments  <dig> to  <dig> and the cauda by segments  <dig> to  <dig>  for human we used caput, corpus, cauda defined in the thimon et al.,  <cit>  study. these data were compared to the boar over-expressed genes list.

we then found that  <dig> mouse unigene ids were common between the  <dig> studies. among these  <dig> genes ids,  <dig> unigene ids were found over-expressed both in one region of boar and one of the regions of the three other different species . meanwhile when we looked for the common over-expressed genes in the same unit in the four different species we ended with only  <dig> ids in the caput,  <dig> in corpus and  <dig> in cauda .

gene deletion effect
using the mouse homologous ids found for our markers, we search the mgi database for reproductive phenotypes .  <dig> of them were associated with a reproductive phenotype, and  <dig> with male infertility. a majority of these gene knockouts results in an impaired sperm production associated with a poor sperm quality, suggesting a testicular action. meanwhile these genes were not all markers of the testis in our study, may be indicating differences between mouse and pig. on another hand, for some genes that were expressed both in testis and in epididymis, the first effect of their knockout might be visible on the testicular function and then affect the sperm formation, and in this case an effect on the epididymal maturation becomes secondary or not visible.

discussion
here we used a  <dig> k nylon microarray made during the french agenae program which is spotted with  <dig> pcr amplified clones. although this represents only a subset of all genes expressed from the complete genome, one of its advantages is that cdna clones libraries from the testis and the epididymis were included at the initial step of normalization. arrays were hybridized to compare gene expression between the testis, vas efferens, nine epididymal zones  and the vas deferens. the pig epididymis is a large organ of more than  <dig> cm long containing about  <dig> meters of a convoluted tubule and its internal organization is much complex than in rodent. it is then more difficult to individualize part of the boar epididymis between connective tissue septae as it has been done in mouse and rat  <cit> . doing this will have been impossible in a time-frame necessary to obtain samples from one animal without mrna degradation and this would have conducted to analyze tens of different epididymal segments which is time and money consuming. moreover previous study on pig secretome  <cit>  and data obtained in rodent suggested that much less transcriptomic units might exist than anatomical separations imply. with pig epididymis it is possible to obtain large samples, including from the vas efferens that is more difficult in rodents. meanwhile anatomical differences between two individual boars may exist, and although we have drawn a special attention to be very reproducible when collecting the samples from different animals, we observed some differences in the gene expressions from some epididymal zones between animals resulting in zones shuffling during membrane clustering . because acquisition of motility and fertility by the spermatozoa is progressive along the epididymis and secretion of proteins is regionalized, we postulated that genes expressed in a tight regionalized manner might play a major role in this process. for this reason we have focused our attention on differentially expressed genes. in doing this we expected to gain information on how this regionalization is maintained , get clues on specific mechanisms  and deduced factors that may be important in the sperm fertility acquisition and epididymal regionalization. then we have not analyzed major known epididymal genes such as clusterin or ptgds since we already known that these genes are widely expressed or present at several levels of the genital tract. these genes that are over-expressed in more than one epididymal transcriptomic unit may have important roles for the cellular functions but may be not directly related to the sperm maturation. meanwhile the microarray approach we used offer the possibility to analyze also these genes, since they could be retrieved in the list of expressed genes that is deposed on the geo database .

because our type of array is not widely used and the biological question more complicated than a simple comparison between two conditions on the same tissue, few statistical tools were available. we had then adapted classical microarray statistical approaches in order to compare the different conditions with a low number of replicates. we have also decided to cross the results from different statistical analysis to ascertain and strengthen our results, especially to define epididymal markers. our analysis found  <dig> transcripts with a differential expression between the  <dig> conditions; this represents about 24% of the transcripts spotted and 27% of our  <dig> qualified spots. in rat about 13%  from the  <dig> transcripts of the microarray were found highly regulated along the epididymis and comparable results were obtained in mouse and human.

tissues clustering indicated a good biological reproducibility since arrays from the same tissues from different animals clustered together with few exceptions where one zone could shift from one cluster to the previous or the following one. we did not observe an effect of the breed induced by the 3/4lw-1/4landrace boars. the clustering procedure builds  <dig> informative tissue array clusters from our data. the testis was always well separated from the other tissues and the epididymal zones were clustered in anterior-, median-, posterior-caput, corpus and cauda . the vas efferens formed one independent cluster.

in contrast, transcripts clustering defined only  <dig> different co-expression clusters: testis was separated from the rest of the tissues then vas efferens and cauda/vas deferens were grouped together while two epididymal clusters, caput and corpus, were formed. this clustering difference  could be explained by the number of objects included in each analyze: for classifying the  <dig> microarrays the procedure used  <dig> transcripts, while transcripts were classified using only  <dig> or  <dig> values for each of the  <dig> different tissues which reduced the statistical power of the analysis.

in that analysis vas efferens/cauda/vas deferens may have been clustered together because they have some common genes involved in common functions  such as ions binding and transport, or response to the same regulatory factors  or more strikingly gene such as awn that codes for a specific boar sperm associated protein described mainly in the seminal vesicle  <cit> , although it was also immunolocalized in rete testis and on epididymal sperm  <cit> . meanwhile the vas efferens showed also a unique and different set of genes expression in agreement with its mixed embryonic origin  compared to the epididymis  and the vas deferens   <cit> .

this discrepancy in the number of clusters between tissues and transcripts has conducted us to analyze the data with particular statistical approaches to assign specific differential transcripts for each of the  <dig> groups of microarrays. the use of two different approaches has also allowed us to strengthen our results and choose the transcripts with more confidence. moreover the search for differential genes in each epididymal transcriptomic unit brought us to re-do the analysis excluding testis and ve units. in doing that, we increased the number of transcripts in some of the epididymal clusters but this was not general since some clusters have also lost some genes that became non statistically significant over the epididymis as they were when the testis or the vas efferens were included. this approach also explains why some of the gene known to be highly expressed by the boar epididymis were not found in the list of markers; these genes were either expressed in two different clusters  or their high expression spanned over different adjacent clusters and then they were not retained as differential between the epididymal transcriptomic units. this was the case for example for rnase  <dig> , previously found in the pig anterior caput  <cit> , that was found over-expressed in our array analysis exclusively from zones  <dig> to  <dig> then in both anterior and median caput clusters.

we have ended with lists of significant over-expressed transcripts and markers for each of the tissue clusters that were further used to validate our microarrays data. for almost all transcripts chosen, we find a very good agreement between the level of expression obtained either by microarrays, rt-pcr and real time pcr. among these genes used for this validation we have selected a certain number because information on expression in male reproductive tract were available and we have also analyzed new genes and genes not yet reported in epididymis.

the first one was clusterin . the mrna is present both in the testis and the epididymis as well as different isoforms of the protein. this protein as many different functions  but its exact role in these organs is not yet known. this dual expression was retrieved in boar by microarray and pcr, and clu was classified in our analysis in the testis due to its higher level of expression in this tissue. this gene is expressed over more than one transcriptomic unit of the epididymis  where the protein secretion and presence in the fluid has already been described  <cit> . insl <dig> and inha were genes already known to be testicular and were found over-expressed in the boar testis. insl <dig>  expressed mainly in leydig cells, mediates the first phase of testicular descent and mutation of this gene leads to cryptorchidism  <cit> . inha encodes for the inhibin alpha subunit, mrna and protein chain have been localized to sertoli cells, which is the major body source of this protein.

for the anterior caput, the boar homologue to ce <dig>  was analyzed. this gene has been found in the upper part epididymis of dog and mouse epididymis  but not in human epididymis  <cit> . it has been suggested that its expression is regulated by luminal factors from the testis  <cit> . this gene encodes for an integral membrane protein and no clear function as been yet assigned.

gpx <dig> gene has also been extensively study in the epididymis where it codes for an androgen-dependent glutathione peroxidase specific in the distal caput epididymis of mouse and rat  <cit> . a role for sperm and epididymis protection against oxidative stress has been suggested for this enzyme. in pig this mrna was shown caput epididymis specific where the protein has been found secreted in the fluid  <cit> . in agreement with these results we found gpx <dig> over-expressed in zones  <dig> to  <dig>  secreted phosphoprotein one  is widely distributed and was found over-expressed in vas efferens and caput and at a lower level in cauda epididymis. this protein is involved in different cellular processes such as calcium transport, bone resorption and extracellular matrix  remodeling. in rat, it has been expressed and localized in testis, vas deferens, and caput epididymis where it was found associated with cellular vesicles and may be involved in fluid calcium depletion  <cit> . in bull seminal plasma, this protein has been related to sperm fertility  <cit> . in boar polymorphisms in the opn gene region have been significantly associated with male fertility traits, mainly motility and acrosome reaction  <cit> .

man2b <dig> is a lysosomal type d-mannosidase secreted in porcine epididymal fluid   <cit>  and was found expressed and secreted only in a narrow region between the caput and corpus epididymis while it is found mainly in the murine testis at the spermatogonia level  <cit> . recently a polymorphism in this gene was associated with ovulation rate in a meishan-cross gilts population  <cit> . our data confirmed that man2b <dig> was mainly epididymal in boar with a caput-corpus specific over-expression. recently we have described the ces <dig> carboxylesterase  in the epididymal fluid of various mammals, and its mrna was found in ram corpus epididymis. here we showed that like in ram, ces <dig> expression is restricted to the corpus epididymis where the protein was immunolocalized in the boar fluid  <cit> . carboxypeptidase e  is a pro-hormone processing enzyme  in neuro/endocrine cells and a peripheral membrane protein of secretory granules where it plays also a receptor role that directs the pro-hormone to the regulated secretory pathway  <cit> . the expression of cpe mrna in both neural tissues and some non-neural tissues has been shown during embryonic development  <cit>  but not reported in the reproductive tract. interestingly cpe gene is over-expressed in the corpus epididymis where the main enriched go terms are related to reticulum endoplasmic functions. whether this region secreted specific factors or hormones that need to be processed by carboxypeptidase e remains to be elucidated.

we have also focused our attention on several gene families that have been previously described in different epididymal studies.

lipocalins are found in vertebrates, insects and plants. they are involved in the transport or storage of hydrophobic and/or chemically sensitive organic compounds, especially vitamins, lipids, steroids and other secondary metabolites  <cit> . several lipocalins have been described in epididymis such as the retinol-binding protein lcn <dig> ), lcn <dig>  lcn <dig>  lcn <dig>  lcn <dig> or the ptgds  and numerous studies have shown their regional intensities of expression both at mrna and proteins levels  <cit> . their exact individual role in the epididymal function is still unclear. here we have studied some of these lipocalins  and shown their regional expressions in boar and we have described new lipocalin members that were not yet observed in mammalian epididymis ) and a new lipocalin member matching with the human unq <dig> sequence. ucal- <dig> is a  <dig> kda lipocalin that has been described in the horse endometrium before embryo attachment where it is secreted abundantly suggesting a role between maternal and foetal tissues dialogue  <cit> . this gene was improperly name uterocalin since it has a different sequence from mouse uterocalin  which is a 25-kda lipocalin originally purified from human neutrophils and highly expressed in rodent caput epididymis  <cit> . in boar epididymis ucal-p <dig> showed a differential expression by microarray that could not be clearly confirmed by rt-pcr, certainly due to its low level of expression. pcr indicated also that, contrary to rodent, lcn <dig> had a low and not differential expression in boar. apolipoprotein d , a 29-kda glycoprotein associated with high-density lipoproteins, is predicted to be a member of the lipocalin family based on its primary structure  <cit> . the protein is multifunctional and has many different ligands. it binds and transports small hydrophobic compounds including sterols-derived molecules. its mrna has been localized in numerous tissues including the testis. we retrieved the testicular expression of this gene and showed that it is also expressed more in the vas efferens and vas deferens than other epididymal regions. human unq <dig> sequence, for which no role or localization information is available, was located on chromosome  <dig> close to a lipocalins cluster containing lcn <dig>  lcn <dig> and lcn <dig>  its expression was very similar to lcn <dig> and lcn <dig> expression in boar caput epididymis suggesting they could be controlled by the same factors  <cit> .

defensins, a family of secreted antimicrobial cationic peptides with molecular weights of 4– <dig> kda, have a distinctive sequence pattern of six to eight cysteine residues. they are categorized into alpha-, beta-, and theta-defensins according to the arrangement of their three-four disulfide bonds  <cit> . defensins peptides are the major antimicrobial proteins of innate immunity found in mammals and it seems that in mammals defensins are mainly from the alpha and beta classes. in human over  <dig> beta-defensins orf have been found  and in rat and in mouse at least  <dig> and  <dig> genes and pseudogenes respectively were discovered by genome scans  <cit> . moreover, it is also demonstrated that some defensin gene  are able to use different exons to produce multiple isoforms of beta-defensin-like sequences  <cit> . specific expression of numerous epididymal beta-defensins has been shown and spag <dig> and recently defb <dig> have been found associated with sperm and the latter is involved in attaching sperm to the oviduct epithelia and may be involved in sperm motility and capacitation  <cit> . in their study jelinsky et al.  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> defensins by qpcr in mouse and rat and showed that they had very similar epididymal regionalization in these two species. recently, sang et al.  <cit>  in a blast search on pig est described  <dig> beta-defensins and eight were found by rt-pcr in the male reproductive tract including the epididymis  and the testis. pbd <dig>  pbd <dig> were found mainly in proximal epididymis while pbd <dig> was mainly in cauda. pep2c was found in testis and epididymis while pbd <dig> and pbd <dig> only in testis. other defensins were also expressed , pbd125) in testis and/or epididymis but without differential expression in this last tissue. we have ascertained the identities by sequencing and cysteine motifs alignments of the seven beta-defensin clones found spotted on our microarray. five of them showed an anterior caput over-expression while the spag11b_e isoform had a posterior caput expression. only defb <dig> was found in corpus. the discrepancy with the previous study could be explained by the fact that these authors used a  <dig> cycles rt-pcr that is certainly not as discriminative as our microarray analysis. moreover for this defensin and the two other , that were also analyzed by rt-pcr, we found a very good agreement with the microarray data. interestingly the expression profiles of the defensin genes in boar were closely similar to those observed in mouse and rat, even for the spag11b isoforms.

proteases and proteases inhibitors have an important role in proteins processing both in tissues, fluids and at the sperm plasma membrane levels during the maturation process. we have focused on several members of different type of protease inhibitors. wap protease inhibitors contain the wap four-disulfide core domain structure, a motif first described in whey acidic protein present in the milk of rats and mice. wap motifs consist of about  <dig> amino acids with eight highly conserved cysteine residues forming four disulphide bridges. then wap protease inhibitors possess like defensins specific cystein motifs and exhibit antimicrobial and antifungal activities  indicating also a role in the innate immunity  <cit> . several inhibitors of this family have been found in epididymis  <cit>  such as wfdc <dig>  and spinlw <dig>  and may play a role in sperm maturation and function. wfdc <dig>  is also over-expressed in different normal and malignant tissues  <cit> . we found several wap domains proteins in the clones spotted and we ascertained their identity by sequence comparison. wfdc <dig> was mainly found in caput epididymis in mouse and rat and it is a distal cauda epididymal gene in human. in boar, it is present all along the epididymis with an over-expression in cauda. wfdc <dig> is a testicular over-expressed gene in boar while it is found in testis  and highly expressed in caput/corpus in rat. slpi is expressed in wide range of tissue and it has been immunolocalized in human epididymis and found in seminal plasma. it has been shown highly expressed all along the rat epididymis and slightly in mouse  <cit> . in boar, slpi appears as a specific vas efferens gene. we analyzed also an uncharacterized wap domain-containing protein with an unknown function mainly expressed in the boar cauda epididymis and that was named wfdc10a-like from the closest human sequence found . the exact role of all these wap domains proteins as inhibitors in epididymis remained to be elucidated as well as their potential role as bacterial defenses. interestingly, wfdc <dig>  wfdc <dig>  wfdc10a and slpi are found on the same gene cluster in human chromosome  <dig>  the mouse wfdc <dig> homologuous gene has also been found highly expressed in mouse cauda epididymis  <cit> .

because a large number of gene are translated in several spliced mrnas coding for different proteins and this different spliced mrnas may be differentially expressed along the epididymis , we analyzed two genes for which spliced mrna forms were found in our data.

cystatins are reversible inhibitors of cysteine proteases. they are found in all living organisms and are involved in various biological processes and also take part in disease pathology  <cit> . several cystatins have been shown mainly expressed in epididymis such as cst <dig>  in proximal caput where it is secreted in the fluid  <cit> . cystatin  <dig>  known as cres <dig> in mouse is a member of the cst type  <dig> family. its mrna was identified in macaca epididymis where it is expressed almost exclusively in the epididymis. the protein is most abundant in the initial segment, but is detected throughout the epididymis and on ejaculated sperm  <cit> . these authors indicated that a spliced deletion form of this mrna could exist  and both recombinant proteins were produced. interestingly both form of this protein exhibited antibacterial activity. we found the full length and the deleted mrnas in our spotted clones, and observed by pcr that both mrna exist and were expressed in the epididymis. both had a very similar pattern of expression with two maximum  although the deleted transcript showed lower expression intensity. this caput over-expression of cst <dig> is also reported in mouse and in rat.

we also found in our microarray two clones that were similar to the mouse eg <dig> mrna  that has been found in mouse epididymis  <cit> . this gene has an unknown function. in pig, this sequence matched two clones, both showing a different deletion when compared to the mouse sequence. both mrnas were ascertained by pcr and sequencing, they showed similar level and pattern of expression in posterior caput/corpus. the mouse mrna was shown expressed in caput epididymis only after puberty by real time pcr and confirmed by transcriptomic study  <cit> .

at least we have also analyzed newly discovered genes and genes not yet reported in boar. the first one was spink5l <dig>  which is a putative kazal type serine protease inhibitor 5-like  <dig>  spinks are a family of inhibitors with a characteristic signature consisting of six consensus cysteines forming three specific disulfide bonds  <cit> . several members of this inhibitor family have been shown to have a differential expression in the mouse, the rat and the human epididymis. their protease targets in the epididymis remained elusive. recently, as part of a cluster of spink, five new spink members were identified including spink5l <dig>  <cit> . none of these members had functional annotation. we found that the mrna of the pig spinkl <dig> homologue is highly expressed in the corpus epididymis. we found also a gene that is similar to mon1b, a sand family protein. these proteins have recently been shown to function at the tethering/docking stage of the vacuole fusion as a critical component of the snare complex  <cit> . the mon1b gene is found over-expressed in the corpus epididymis were it is known that a high level of secretion takes place. fxyd <dig>  also known as the gamma subunit of the na, k-atpase, regulates the properties of that enzyme. in mouse epididymal transcriptome this gene was not reported and in rat it was found mainly over-expressed in the cauda. in boar it is mainly in the ve where it may play a role in fluid/ion balance.

gp <dig>  glycoprotein  <dig>  gene encodes for a gpi-linked membrane protein that plays an important role in assembly of vesicular compartments targeted to apical plasma membranes via regulated exocytosis. this gene was not found differentially expressed in mouse, rat and human epididymal transcriptome. muc <dig> is a novel mucin-like protein that showed structural characteristic of membrane-bound mucins including an extracellular region with several potential glycosylation sites, a putative transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic c-terminal. mrna presence has been reported in human testis  <cit>  and transcriptomic study had shown it in human corpus epididymis  <cit> , but it was not reported in mouse and rat epididymis. the galactosidase glb1l <dig> mrna was not previously reported in epididymis but it is mainly found expressed in testis and prostate using the estprofile viewer at ncbi. the protein has recently been reported in mice acrosome by proteomic study  <cit> . in boar it is present in testis and shows a regional expression in corpus. this glycan-modifying enzymes may play either a role in degalactosylation of sperm surface and/or fluid glycoproteins observed during epididymal transit  <cit> .

the use of microarrays allows also analyzing differential functions through the use of gene ontology terminology. in boar it was difficult to use all the information due to the few genes with a valid go annotation. we had to transform genes in their mouse, human, rat, dog or bull homologous genes and retrieved when possible the go term associated. this results in the loss of a large number of transcripts. however we were able to found several functions over-represented in the different transcriptional units when we compared them together. we analyzed the functions either with four clusters including testis and vas efferens or only with clustered transcripts in the three epididymal units. in testis our go analysis revealed function related to gametogenesis, this is not surprising but gave a good indication on the validity of our data and analysis. as already described some function were common between the vas efferens and vas deferens , but the cauda and vas deferens had functions specific and related to the extracellular matrix remodeling. this enrichment in these go terms has also been observed in human, mouse and rat, suggesting that an important plasticity of this region exists, may be related to the storage of sperm in that part of the epididymis. in the corpus the main terms were associated with genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum function and membrane/vesicles trafficking, suggesting protein synthesis and secretory/reabsorbtion pathways. in boar, immunological and histological studies have described the different pathways of secretion and reabsortion of vesicles at the cellular level  <cit> . although different types of vesicles and mechanisms are involved in this process, a well-developed golgi apparatus system is mainly present in distal corpus were the secretomic analysis had shown that the most intense proteins are secreted and the number of secreted proteins increases from the caput to the caput/corpus region. this golgi apparatus is still present in the corpus where the number of secreted proteins remains high. the finding that differential genes expressed between caput and corpus with this go term may imply that a differential type of protein modifications occurs between these two adjacent segments as it has been suggested by the nature of the secreted proteins  <cit> .

in the caput the main enriched term was receptor activity. receptors for different modulators such as activin, progesterone and fgf were present and among the  <dig> receptors forming this category at least four were retinoic acid responders. this is in agreement with previous studies in rodent that have shown the important role of acid retinoic in the functions of the caput epididymis  <cit> . although vas efferens was clustered with cauda and vas deferens, the go enriched term "coated pit" was associated with the ve. this term was related with four different transcripts over-expressed in this tissue with homology to dab2_human, lrp2_human, lrp1_human and cubn_mouse. lrp <dig> and lpr <dig> are members of the ldl receptor family that plays diverse roles in various biological processes including lipoprotein metabolism, degradation of proteases, activation of lysosomal enzymes, and cellular entry of bacterial toxins and viruses. the presence of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein- <dig>  has been shown in mouse where lpr <dig> plays a role in endocytosis of testicular clusterin by the vas efferens  <cit> . other testicular protein could also be removed by this mechanism such as transferrin or apolipoproteins.

we noticed that three of the four genes , lrp <dig>  and cubn ) are involved in vitamin d uptake, which is considered as a steroidal hormone. the vitamin d metabolite d3) is synthesized in the liver and circulate in complex with its binding protein . the messenger for this protein is present in boar testis and zone  <dig> of the epididymis . the 25d3-dbp complex is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, which is absolutely dependent on the membrane receptors megalin , cubilin  and the adaptor protein disabled- <dig> , the expression of these proteins is in turn modulated by retinoids  <cit> . once in the cell, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin d, 2d3)) is formed by action of the 1-alpha-hydroxylase  and binds to the vitamin d receptor . we found that cyp27b <dig> is expressed all along the boar epididymis and vdr is expressed in the boar testis, vas efferens and epididymis . vdr has also been shown in mouse, rat and rooster epididymis  <cit>  as well as the intracellular vitamin d binding interacting protein  that mediates anchors of the complex to the estrogen receptor  and other nuclear receptors  <cit> . vdr can form homodimer but also heterodimer with the retinoid x receptor  present in the boar vas efferens  and then regulates genomic expression of a large number of genes. vitamin d plays a pivotal role in maintaining serum calcium homeostasis by modulating calcium/phosphate absorption via its action on calcium binding proteins, such as spp <dig>  that is over-expressed in boar ve and caput epididymis. vitamin d is also a regulator of the aromatase in female and male gonad but also in the epididymis  <cit> . interestingly ions and about 90% of the testicular fluid reabsorbtion occur in the vas efferens region, and control of these mechanisms by estrogen has been demonstrated since eralphako mice are infertile primarily due to a defect in efferent ducts development and function related to fluid reabsorbtion  <cit> . recently, it has also been demonstrated that 2d3), stimulates the innate immune response in antigen-presenting cells, like macrophages and dendritic cells but also in other cell types  <cit> . the  <dig> -d/vdr complex bound to the retinoid x receptor increases the endogenous defensin and cathelicidin genes production  <cit> . at least, it was shown that male rat with low vitamin d diet had a lower fertility due to lower testicular sperm production but also poor sperm quality  <cit> .

all along this publication we referred to the previous rodents and human epididymal transcriptomic studies in order to compare the gene expression. we have developed bio-informatic tools to compare information on gene over-expression in the four different species and found that a certain number of genes were over-expressed in the four species in one of the three gross anatomical epididymal regions. this low number of common genes in a similar region was not too surprising. in their study jelinsky et al,  <cit>  whom made a detailed comparison on both the mouse and rat epididymal transcriptomes were strongly limited due to the identification of orthologous sequences present on arrays. starting with more than  <dig>  transcripts, they "only" found  <dig> orthologous genes;  <dig> genes were determined to be expressed in the epididymides of the  <dig> species and  <dig> were differentially expressed. among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> had similar expression patterns in mouse and rat, and  <dig> were different.

although we had a low number of common genes between species, we analyzed the go term associated with the genes of each regions and found that in the caput six genes formed a cluster with functions in cell and to cell signaling and interaction , in the corpus three genes with cell morphology, assembly and development while in the cauda, two main groups of genes formed first a network in cell to cell signaling, morphology and connective tissue development  and a second including  <dig> genes involved in cell death and endocrine system. this demonstrated, if needed, that the epididymis is highly regionalized and this regionalization, regulated by the endocrine system, shows also an important plasticity.

we did not attempt to do the same analysis with the testicular transcripts with different species. meanwhile, although both approaches were quite different, we compared the list of the most intense transcripts from our study with the one recently published in a differential boar testis transcriptomic study between two breeds  <cit> . among the  <dig> most intense differential genes reported by these authors, we found only  <dig> transcripts matching the top  <dig> most intense testicular transcripts of our analysis , cyb <dig>  dhrs4).

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study and transcriptomic studies in other species clearly demonstrated that the high degree regionalization in epididymis is linked to the regionalization of gene expression. this is also well in agreement with the previous secretomic and fluid proteins analysis. this regionalization appears as the results of a specific and subtle regulatory mechanisms from the endocrine system involving androgens and also estrogens. different studies suggested also a numbers of other regulatory components such as retinoid derived from vitamin a. our study indicated that the vas efferens and the caput might have a certain number of genes regulated by retinoid receptors. moreover our analysis suggests also that secosteroids  certainly carried by the testicular and epididymal fluid may have a role in the efferent ducts and epididymal function. it is interesting to note that in rat, epididymis presents the second body level of this compound just behind the kidney  <cit> . then the relevance of the vitamin d as an intracrine-autocrine-paracrine system in the epididymis needs to be further analyzed.

all the transcriptomic studies have found that family of genes such as defensins or different type of protease inhibitors are over-expressed in different places of the epididymis. these proteins have role in the innate immunity response against infection from bacteria and fungus. the presence of such large amount of these compounds may be a necessity to reduce or prevent the presence in the fluid or within the spermatozoa from cells of the immune system that could after developed autoantibodies deleterious for reproduction. it is likely that different defensins are much more than antimicrobial, and further functional work will uncover different roles for what is increasingly regarded as a multifunctional gene family. anti-proteases may also be involved in the regulation of the sperm and fluid proteins processing that occurs during maturation and are part of this maturation process.

at least all these transcriptomic studies allow us to see through the high complexity and specialization of epididymis and differences between species. numerous genes are under the same common regulators and then could be targets for future studies to understand the mechanisms involved in epididymal regionalization and those implicated in sperm maturation.
