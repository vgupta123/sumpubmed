BACKGROUND
lichen is formed through a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, which can be either an alga or a cyanobacterium  <cit> . the fungus, or mycobiont, forms a three-dimensional vegetative structure called a thallus, in which the photosynthetic partners, or photobionts, are located. the thallus is a complex and undifferentiated body with upper and lower surfaces of densely aggregated fungal hyphae. the algal  cells are surrounded by fungal hyphae and are maintained beneath the upper cortex. the thallus structure enables gas exchange for the photobiont population and competes for well-illuminated space above the ground  <cit> . lichen thalli are not individuals but are instead genetically heterogeneous consortia of an unknown number of participants  <cit> . it has however been calculated that the algal cells comprise only approximately 7% of the total thallus volume  <cit> .

one-fifth of fungal species form obligate symbiotic associations with green alga or cyanobacteria  <cit> . this increases to about 46% for ascomycete fungi. the processes of lichenisation and its physiology are therefore relevant to the understanding of ascomycete relationships and the evolution of mechanisms for the control and maintenance of plant-fungal interactions. the number of algal species that can participate within lichenisation processes is less broad. an estimated  <dig> species from  <dig> genera have been reported to form lichen symbioses  <cit> .

the molecular nature of the lichen symbiosis remains debated. some researchers have observed a controlled parasitism of the photobiont by the mycobiont  <cit> . others have reported a mutualistic relationship  <cit> . regardless of the nature of the relationship, lichens inhabit some of the harshest terrestrial climates on earth, and have demonstrated a capacity to survive even the most challenging environmental extremes of outer space  <cit> . most lichen species are tolerant to profound desiccation. this is facilitated by the adoption of an anhydrobiotic state, and in some cases, e.g. lobaria pulmonaria, morphological adaptations to limit the harmful effects of photoinhibition  <cit> . the anhydrobiotic state is facilitated through the accumulation of specific metabolites and polysaccharides that limit the damage caused by desiccation and maintain sufficient physiological integrity so that any resulting damage can be repaired upon eventual rewetting  <cit> .

damage caused by reactive oxygen species  is one of the key threats to surviving anhydrobiosis  <cit> . the ros protective mechanisms are not yet characterised, although basic roles for antioxidants in lichen desiccation and rehydration have been demonstrated in a variety of lichen species  <cit> . the accumulation of antioxidant and photo-protective compounds during desiccation plays an important role in the rapid reestablishment of metabolism and photosynthesis following rehydration  <cit> . a lichen can better tolerate desiccation than either fungus or alga alone since its combined antioxidant and photo-protective mechanisms are more effective than those of the isolated partners  <cit> . understanding and characterising the molecular mechanisms that enable lichens to survive years of desiccation, and the approaches to photo-protection and ros control have potential applied value in the development of innovative strategies for trait improvement in higher plants.

there are many uncharacterised molecular mechanisms that appear specific to lichen, but there are few resources available that can facilitate the genetic characterisation of these processes. genetic resources have however been established for the systematic study and classification of lichens, reviewed in  <cit> . these resources are biased to the needs of taxonomists and evolutionary researchers and are not suitable for functional genomics. research on lichen gene expression is currently limited to a single publication  <cit>  and unpublished data from messen & ott, and as yet there is little in the way of either high-throughput genome sequence or expressed sequence tag  data available for any lichen species. as queried on 7th of february  <dig>  there were  <dig>  lichen est sequences in genbank. the whole genome sequence of the lichen xanthoria parietina has been completed but not yet published according to the doe joint genome institute and a genomic survey of the algal symbiont of the lichen ramalina farinacea is available in the short read archive of the ncbi.

the emergence of the next generation of dna sequencing technologies has enabled the transcriptome and genome sequencing of numerous non-model organisms. for non-model organisms, de novo genome assembly of short read data is complicated but many transcriptomes have been sequenced from non-model species and published over the last years  <cit> . the annotation process remains challenging, especially for species with no close relatives with a sequenced reference genome.

our objective was to generate a lichen transcriptome using both next-generation sequencing and traditional sanger sequencing. the roche gs flx platform was used for the next-generation sequencing. sanger sequencing was performed to complement the flx run data with its long sequence reads. we produced additional sanger est sequences from axenically grown symbiotic partners  to train classification models for predicting the genome of origin of lichen sequences. we have obtained a basic view of the ongoing molecular processes and have identified the most active biological pathways in c. rangiferina. our transcriptome data brings an increase to the amount of publicly available lichen sequences and provides a starting point for further studies into lichen functional genomics.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly
lichen transcriptome sequences were generated using both a high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology run and traditional sanger sequencing from lichen cdna libraries. the gs flx run yielded  <dig>  sequence reads  and  <dig>  est reads were obtained by sanger sequencing. the average length of the cdna sequence reads was  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for gs flx sequences and sanger sequences, respectively . the majority of the gs flx reads were shorter than  <dig> bp , although the maximum read length was  <dig>  bp. after quality and length trimming in the assembly software  <dig>  high quality reads were included in the de novo assembly and they were assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the gs flx reads have been submitted to the short read archive  and the high quality sanger sequences have been submitted to genbank . a list of the contig and singleton sequences is available as additional file  <dig>  the length of the contigs varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp . the n <dig> value of the assembled contigs was  <dig> bp, and the average length of the contigs was  <dig> bp .  <dig> % of the reads were assembled into contigs while  <dig> % of the reads remained as singletons. the sequence reads contained within contigs varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  with the average number of reads per contig being  <dig> . the coverage of the contigs varied between  <dig> and  <dig> with the average coverage being  <dig> .

annotation and classification of the contigs and singletons
as lichen is a symbiosis of two distinct organisms the genome of origin was predicted for the assembled contigs and singletons to define whether sequences originated from the mycobiont  or the photobiont  genomes. this classification was performed using eclat  <cit> . cdna sequences produced from axenically grown symbiotic partners  were used to train the required eclat models to classify and discriminate between the two different genomes. altogether  <dig>  fungal and  <dig> algal sequences derived from the axenically grown symbiont cdna libraries were used for the training. the minimum sequence length for the classification was set at  <dig> bp.  <dig>  lichen sequences could not be classified due to their insufficient sequence length. the complete set of contigs and singletons was classified and  <dig> % of the sequences were predicted as mycobiont sequences and  <dig> % as photobiont sequences . when classifying only the contigs,  <dig> % were predicted as mycobiont and  <dig> % as photobiont. for singleton sequences alone  <dig> % mycobiont and  <dig> % photobiont sequences, were predicted.

the sequences were annotated using the blast2go software  <cit> . the contigs and singletons were included in the annotation process. the annotations included best blastx match selection, gene ontology id assignment, enzyme code assignments and interpro domains calculation. blastx analysis using the ncbi non-redundant  database revealed that  <dig>  sequences  had a match in the database with a cut-off value of 1e- <dig>  for the contigs alone, the percentage of sequences with a blast result was  <dig> %.  <dig> %  of the sequences had the best blast match to a fungal species, while  <dig> %  had an algal species as the best match .  <dig> %  had the best match to a plant species,  <dig> %  to a bacterium,  <dig> %  to a protist, 1%  to an insect,  <dig> %  to a lichen,  <dig> %  to a mammal and  <dig> %  to other.  <dig>  sequences  had matches to gene ontology  term annotations and  <dig>  sequences  had interpro matches.

the go annotations of the sequences form three core categories; biological process , cellular component  and molecular function .  <dig>  sequences were assigned to biological process,  <dig>  to cellular component and  <dig>  to molecular function. there were  <dig>  unique bp terms,  <dig> unique cc terms and  <dig>  unique mf terms assigned to the sequences. the go terms with the largest number of assigned sequences in the bp category  were oxidation reduction , rna metabolic process , catabolic process , translation  and response to stimulus . for cc  the terms with the most sequences were cytoplasmic part , intracellular organelle part  and nucleus . in mf category  the terms with the most sequences were atp binding , nucleic acid binding , oxidoreductase activity , protein binding  and nucleoside-triphosphatase activity . the sequences were also assigned to kegg pathways  and the pathways with the most sequences were purine metabolism , methane metabolism , pyrimidine metabolism , thiamine metabolism  and oxidative phosphorylation . altogether  <dig> kegg pathways were identified and the full pathway list is available as additional file  <dig>

discussion
lichens are symbiotic organisms consisting of two components; a fungal partner or mycobiont and an algal partner or photobiont. lichens are remarkable organisms in their ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions including even outer space  <cit> . they resume photosynthesis rapidly after even long periods of desiccation  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying lichen’s survival adaptations are uncharacterised and genomic resources for lichens are limited. to gain a glimpse of the molecular nature of these neglected organisms, we have generated est sequences from grey reindeer lichen, cladonia rangiferina, using both high-throughput next-generation sequencing and traditional sanger sequencing. the sequences were de novo assembled with  <dig> % of the reads assembling into contigs, and only  <dig> % of the reads remaining as singletons. these values are similar to other non-model organism transcriptome de novo assemblies  <cit> .

as the grey reindeer lichen is a symbiotic organism comprising of two distinct genomes, the asterochloris genome and the cladonia rangiferina genome, the sequences were classified to identify their genome of origin, and to obtain an estimate of the ratio of fungal to algal sequences in the lichen transcriptome. more than half of the sequences were classified as fungal sequences, although this varied depending on whether contigs or singletons were classified. the difference between contigs and singletons is in both their length and cis-substantiation suggesting that sequence length affects classification. blastx best match taxonomic assignment shows a similar ratio of fungus to alga / plant sequences ratio as the predictive classification performed by eclat. this suggests that the taxonomic assignment performance is consistent and robust. although probable non-target sequences, as evidenced by blastx analysis, may be present within our sequence collection, the amount of contamination is modest and should not affect the classification. the ratio of the two organisms has been estimated previously with 7% of cells being of algal origin  <cit> . similar values were obtained in an analysis of lobaria pulmonaria protein spectra, where 10% of the spectra were assigned to green algal proteins  <cit> . our results suggest a higher percentage of algal transcripts expressed in wetted lichen tissue. transcript abundance likely correlates most with transcriptional activity and with thallus cell abundance to a lesser level . however, our results appear to confirm the mycobiont as the dominant partner in the symbiosis even in the context of gene expression.

since no lichen reference genome has yet been published annotation was performed by comparing homologous protein sequences with blastx.  <dig> % of all assembled contig sequences had a blast hit when run against the non-redundant protein sequence database. a considerable fraction of the sequences remain as unidentified and apparently novel sequences. this percentage was considerably lower for the singleton sequences. similar homology results with lower blast match percentages for singletons have been reported for other non-model organism transcriptome de novo assemblies  <cit> . the numbers are also concordant with those published by joneson et al. who found a significant homology to 50% of cladonia grayi sequences in the nr database  <cit> . some of the sequences without a blast match are likely utrs, but novel, lichen specific sequences are also likely present in this sequence collection. the cdna libraries used for sequencing were also un-normalized and therefore there can be a significant redundancy in the ests sequenced. in addition, as no reference genome is yet available for any lichen species, the reads were not mapped - this would yield an ideal assignment.

a significant majority of the sequences had either an alga, a fungus, or a lichen species as the best match in the blast search . however, only  <dig> % of the sequences had the best match to a lichen species, which illustrates the current lack of lichen sequences in the public databases. the largest non-target taxonomic groups were the bacteria , protists , and other . since lichen thalli are also known to contain internal bacterial communities  <cit> , the presence of bacterial sequences from the lichen microbiome is not unexpected.

to decipher the biological meaning of the blast annotated sequences, go and kegg databases were used for functional annotation, while interpro search was performed to identify recognisable protein motifs within our sequence collection. lichens have been found to protect themselves from the damage caused by ros during desiccation by using antioxidants  <cit>  but the enzymatic antioxidants are also involved in removing ros produced during normal metabolism  <cit> . this could be reflected by the go terms related to oxidation within the most enriched go terms . also in the identified kegg pathways , glutathione metabolism pathway potentially indicates that constitutive protection mechanisms against ros are active in wetted lichen thallus, as has been previously studied by measuring high amounts of reduced glutathione in undesiccated lichens  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that highly-desiccation tolerant lichens rely mainly on constitutive protection mechanisms, which require constant levels of gene expression  <cit> .

several enriched go terms and most of the identified kegg pathways were involved in energy, nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms. these findings are consistent with earlier results, in which spectra assigned to proteins involved in post-translational modifications, energy production and conversion were highly abundant in the mycobiont  <cit> . the same study found that proteins involved in energy production and conversion strongly dominate the protein fraction of green alga. similarly, pathways involved in photosynthesis  are among the kegg pathways with highest amount of sequences in our results.

the carbohydrate produced by the photobiont is leaked and taken up by the mycobiont and consequently converted to arabitol and mannitol through the phosphate pentose pathway  <cit> . the transport-related enriched go terms and the pentose phosphate pathway within the identified kegg pathways potentially indicate that this mechanism is active in the studied lichen thallus. surprisingly, methane metabolism had the second highest amount of sequences within the kegg pathways. the sequences associated with this pathway could potentially be novel, lichen-specific sequences, which have a high homology to the proteins associated with methane metabolism, but which are in reality associated with an uncharacterised pathway, e.g. the production of a lichen-specific secondary metabolite.  <dig> % of the sequences had a match in the interpro database, and this suggests that although a reasonable proportion of the sequences contain a number of recognisable protein motifs, there are many unrecognisable sequences, some of which may contain novel protein structures.

CONCLUSIONS
we have sequenced the transcriptome of a non-model organism, grey reindeer lichen, through high-throughput next-generation sequencing and traditional sanger sequencing from cdna libraries. lichen is a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga and therefore also the transcriptome is comprised of genes originating from the two distinct genomes. we were able to discern the genome of origin for the lichen sequences by using sequences derived from axenically cultured symbiotic partners as training sequences. often the bottleneck of analysing sequence material from non-model organisms lies in the annotation process, as no reference genome is available, and also the sequences available in public databases can be almost non-existent. using information from several different databases we have described here the first de novo assembly and characterization of any lichen transcriptome. the results give a preliminary glimpse into the molecular nature of the lichen symbiosis and the transcriptional space of this resilient organism as we have identified kegg pathways and go terms associated with the lichen sequences. these data will also significantly increase the amount of publicly available lichen sequences. we will be exploring the lichen gene expression further in our ongoing research by designing a custom microarray based on these sequence data and comparing the differences in gene expression between differently treated lichen samples. these results are expected to give more insight to lichen desiccation mechanisms and reveal genes involved in the rapid re-establishment of photosynthesis upon hydration.
