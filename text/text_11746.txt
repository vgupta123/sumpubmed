BACKGROUND
multidrug membrane transport proteins are very effective in antibiotic resistance as they pump drugs across bacterial membranes and out of cells. the family of small multidrug  transporters are the smallest known multidrug transport proteins  <cit> , consisting of  <dig> transmembrane α helices  <cit> . the mechanism of multidrug transport is not understood in detail and smr proteins provide an opportunity to probe the process in greater depth. lipid composition and global properties of the lipid bilayer play key roles in membranes, often actively modifying the function of membrane proteins. multidrug transporters themselves bind a variety of substrates and thus, flexibility in the transport protein binding pocket may be reflected in sensitivity to their surrounding lipids. in particular the proteins are likely to be sensitive to global lipid bilayer properties and the forces exerted on them by their surrounding lipids. here, we investigate smr proteins from two common pathogens; emre from escherichia coli and tbsmr from mycobacterium tuberculosis . we focus on the influence of lipid bilayer composition on smr protein function.

smr proteins are proton, drug antiporters and extrude a variety of hydrophobic, cationic substrates through an exchange of the substrate and proton at a glu residue   <cit> . substrate binding and transport is thus ph dependent as it is affected by the protonation state of this glu residue, the pka of which has been estimated as  <dig>  for e <dig> in emre  <cit> . emre confers resistance to a variety of molecules, including ethidium, methylviologen , tetraphenylphosphonium  and tetracycline. tbsmr has 41% sequence identity to emre and transports ethidium and mv, but cannot transport tpp  <cit> . emre is the best characterised family member and seems to function as a dimer  <cit> .

emre is found in the bacterial inner membrane of gram negative e. coli, the major constituents of which are phosphatidylethanolamine  lipids, followed by anionic phosphatidylglycerol  with a smaller proportion of cardiolipin. m. tuberculosis are classified as acid fast bacteria, as the high mycolic acid content of their cell walls is responsible for their resistance to acids that are used during staining procedures and results in poor staining compared to gram negative or positive bacteria. despite differences between the cell walls of e. coli and m. tuberculosis, tbsmr of the latter bacteria also resides in a membrane dominated by pe lipids, but the second major lipid constituent is anionic phosphatidylinositol  lipid and then cardiolipin  <cit> . here, we investigate the influence of lipid composition on mv transport by emre in defined lipid-bilayer vesicles with a pc background. dioleoyl pc lipids with c <dig> chains each with one unsaturated bond  form fluid lamellar bilayers, while the corresponding dope lipid alone forms non-lamellar phases as it induces monolayer curvature towards the aqueous phase. increasing the proportion of dope increases the curvature elastic stress of the bilayer, which is also accompanied by an increase in the lipid chain lateral pressure  <cit> . these effects have been shown to affect the insertion, folding and function of membrane proteins  <cit> . in addition, we have previously shown that the dope content of dopc/dope bilayers affects the activity of emre  <cit> . this reflects pe altering the overall properties and lateral pressure profile of the bilayer. we also found preliminary evidence for a role of the anionic lipid pg in enhancing activity. here, we extend our work and investigate the effects of pe and pg on the activity of emre and tbsmr. in such a systematic study of lipid effects, we use synthetic lipids with defined chains as opposed to the native lipids, which for example in the case of e. coli pe are a mixture of different chain lengths and saturation.

emre and tbsmr can be reconstituted into e. coli lipid vesicles and transport mv, but tbsmr transports less well than emre. we measure substrate transport in different lipid conditions. optimisation of an established radioactive assay  <cit>  enables us to compare the lipid influence on mv transport by the two transporters with different native lipid composition; emre from gram negative e. coli and tbsmr from acid-fast m. tuberculosis.

RESULTS
mv transport
emre and tbsmr were purified into n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside , as his-tagged protein following overexpression in e. coli according to previous methods  <cit> . protein yields were ~ <dig> mg for emre and  <dig>  mg of tbsmr per litre of culture at > 95% purity.

reconstitution and assay conditions were optimised using emre and e. coli lipid vesicles. transport activity was quantified using ph driven transport of radiolabelled, 14c, mv a method that has been extensively applied to emre  <cit> . previous reconstitution procedures  <cit>  were optimised to maintain a ph gradient across the liposome bilayer during the transport measurement. emre was purified into ddm, but was then exchanged into octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside  prior to reconstitution into lipid vesicles. although emre is less stable in og, this detergent is easier to remove from the bilayer than ddm  as og has a higher critical micelle concentration  than ddm . thus this initial exchange of the protein to og reduces proton leakage through the lipid bilayer enabling a proton gradient to be maintained which can drive mv translocation over minutes. the amount of og remaining after reconstitution into e. coli lipid vesicles was  <dig>  mm . if emre was reconstituted directly from ddm into lipid vesicles ,  <dig> %  of ddm remained in e. coli protein-containing lipid vesicles. this is above the cmc of  <dig> % and resulted in leaky lipid vesicles that could not maintain a ph gradient. the og reconstitution procedure used here also involved only partial pre-saturation of the lipid vesicles by og to help maintain bilayer integrity, but which also meant that <50% of the protein reconstituted. for example,  <dig> μg of emre was initially mixed with e. coli lipid vesicles but only  <dig> μg were found to be associated with the vesicles after reconstitution. since smr proteins are more unstable in og compared to ddm, the proteins were immediately reconstituted into lipid vesicles following detergent exchange into og.

emre was reconstituted, via og, into e. coli lipid vesicles that were initially prepared by sonication or extrustion to give differing sizes . as shown in figure  <dig> increased assay reproducibility is observed when vesicles were formed by extrusion rather than sonication. in addition  <dig> nm diameter lipid vesicles were chosen over  <dig> nm lipid vesicles, since it was possible to determine both a linear regime of transport to determine an "initial rate of transport" as well as saturation of transport . the initial rate of mv transport by emre in  <dig> nm e. coli lipid vesicles was ~ <dig> nmol. min- <dig>  mg- <dig> 

in summary, reconstitution of og solubilised smr proteins in og pre-saturated lipid vesicles, gave tight lipid vesicles with low proton leakage and enabled linear mv transport to be observed in lipid vesicles over several minutes and thus initial rates to be determined. radiolabelled mv transport provides a quantitative measure of emre transport activity. activities over specified range of lipid conditions were quantified for emre and tbsmr by mv transport, as mv is a substrate for both proteins.

lipid dependence of emre and tbsmr by mv transport
mv transport by emre was investigated in lipid vesicles of pc/pe, pc/pg and pg/pe. as an example, figure 2a shows raw data for ph-driven transport of mv into pc/pg lipid vesicles containing emre. we investigated maintenance of the proton gradient in the different lipid vesicles using a ph sensitive dye. proton leakage has previously been shown to be unaffected by changes in membrane properties such as fluidity and lateral pressure induced by pe  <cit>  and has been found to be particularly low in pe and anionic lipid containing membranes  <cit> . figure 2b shows there was very little change in the fluorescence of the ph sensitive dye, carboxyfluorescein, enclosed within emre-containing lipid vesicles. the ph gradient was well maintained in all synthetic lipid mixtures during the time period  over which mv transport was linear with time. good maintenance of the ph gradient  was observed over  <dig> mins for all pc/pe, pc/pg and pg/pe emre-containing lipid vesicles used here , apart from 100% dopc lipid vesicles. a larger increase of about 25% over  <dig> mins  was observed in dopc lipid vesicles containing emre. this indicates a small, continual reduction in the ph gradient across these vesicles thus mv transport is probably slightly underestimated in this particular lipid composition. the initial fluorescence intensity of  <dig> μm carboxyfluorescein within the emre-lipid vesicles of all pc, pg and pe compositions varied by <15% , indicating that the magnitude of the ph gradients was similar in all lipid compositions. a higher fluorescence intensity  was however observed for e. coli lipid vesicles containing emre together with a gradual, non-linear increase in the fluorescence of ~30% over  <dig> mins, showing the ph gradient is poorly maintained in e. coli lipids. despite this reduction of ph gradient, e. coli lipids showed higher rates of transport , thus still indicating an effect of lipid composition on transport activity.

in order to compare transport over a range of lipid compositions, the initial rates  were determined per mg of emre associated with the lipid vesicles. the protein concentrations used in the assays were quantified using western blots following colorimetric detection. the amount of protein associated with the lipid vesicles was found to be independent of lipid composition. in order to eliminate variations in initial rates due to different protein preparations, the same thawed protein sample was used for comparisons of rates across each lipid series; for example, a protein sample was exchanged from ddm into og, and aliquots of this one sample used for all pc/pg measurements. we also only compare relative increases in initial rates for the same protein sample.

a the mole fraction is that of the second lipid; for dopc/dope it refers to the mole fraction the dope that is added

tbsmr was less active than emre in the lipids used here thus the amount of protein and the ph gradient were increased by raising the ph from  <dig> to  <dig> outside the lipid vesicles . figure 3a shows that linear transport was observed over longer times than for the emre experiments, but that less mv was incorporated into the lipid vesicles even with the larger ph gradient . the rate of mv transport by tbsmr was ~ <dig> nmol. min- <dig>  mg- <dig> in e. coli lipids , which is approximately  <dig> fold slower than that of emre of ~ <dig> nmol. min- <dig>  mg- <dig> . mv transport by tbsmr was investigated in the same pc, pe and pg lipid systems as for emre. additionally since the native tbsmr membrane contains pi  transport in dopc/soy pi and soy pi/dope lipid vesicles was also investigated. figure 3b and table  <dig> show that the rate of mv transport by tbsmr increased with increasing pe or pg in pc lipid vesicles, with a maximum at about  <dig>  mole fraction pe, similarly to emre  but the overall increase is only about 4-fold, and lower than that for emre. this smaller dependence on lipid composition also masked any effect of pe in pg/pe lipid vesicles . a larger increase in tbsmr activity was seen with increasing pi in pc/pi lipid vesicles, for which there was a maximum transport rate at about  <dig> – <dig>  mole fraction pi that was about 20-fold greater than the rate in dopc . the addition of pe to the anionic pi caused ~5-fold increase in pi/ <dig>  pe over dopg or ~25-fold increase over dopc .

in summary, the activity of both emre and tbsmr increase with pe or anionic lipid, with the native pi lipid increasing the rate more than pg for tbsmr. the addition of dope to dopc bilayers has the same effect on emre and tbsmr initial rates of transport. an increase in activity, which maximizes at 40% dope is observed followed by a gradual decrease above this dope percentage. in addition the largest increase in tbsmr activity is observed upon the incorporation of pi to dopc lipids, a phenomenon mirrored upon the addition of dopg to dopc with respect to emre activity. finally the largest initial rates are seen for pg/pe or pi/pe mixtures, respectively for emre or tbsmr.

lipid dependence of emre substrate km
km and vmax were estimated for mv transport by emre in the different lipid mixtures. figure  <dig> shows the dependence of the emre initial transport rate on mv concentration in dopc, which in a simple, michaelis menten model would saturate at some point; when all proteins are transporting. however, the curves did not saturate fully even at very high mv concentrations, > <dig> mm . such a high  <dig> mm concentration of mv corresponds to about  <dig> mv molecule per lipid and since the positive charges and overall polarity of mv means it can bind to phospholipid headgroups  <cit> , mv will bind and significantly interfere with the liposome structure and lipid bilayer properties at this 1: <dig> ratio. thus, the bilayer properties will be gradually altered as the mv concentration increases and at high mv concentrations will be significantly different to those of mv-free lipid vesicles. since, bilayer composition and properties influences transport activity by emre, this means the bilayer itself is changing and is no longer inert during these mv measurements. the background, non-specific binding  of mv to the lipid vesicles increased with mv concentration, being ~ <dig> times greater at  <dig> μm mv than at  <dig> μm mv. however, the background binding did not change over time at any mv concentration and thus does not represent passive diffusion of mv across the bilayer .

the non-specific binding/partitioning of mv was found to depend on lipid composition. twice as much mv partitioning was observed in 100% dopg than in 100% dopc . the higher partitioning of mv into dopg vesicles is most likely due to the negative charge of dopg lipids attracting the positively charged mv. this effect could also partly explain the greater transport of mv into dopg lipid vesicles by emre, since there will be a higher local concentration of mv present at the membrane surface or partitioned into the membrane. however, there must also be an additional effect, other than charge, since the highest rates of transport by emre are observed with mixtures of dopc and dopg, rather than pure dopg. an overall decrease in mv associated with lipid vesicles was observed in pg/pe lipid vesicles as the proportion of pe increased up to 40% but no further variation was observed above 40% pe.

in spite of the lack of complete saturation , we estimated km or vmax for pc/pg mixtures after taking more data points up to  <dig> μm mv . no significant changes could be detected in km  as the pg mole fraction was altered, but the vmax increased with increasing pg, from  <dig> μmole.min- <dig> in dopc, to around  <dig> μmole.min- <dig> in dopc/dopg mixtures or dopg alone . thus, the presence of pg above a mole fraction of  <dig>  causes an approximate 10-fold increase in vmax, but no detectable change in km. this shows that the 22-fold increase in initial rate upon addition of > <dig>  mole fraction pg  is reflected in an increase in vmax.

errors are the standard deviation of the fit of the data to the michaelis menten curve)

mv transport data at high mv with pe present in the lipid vesicles  was too error prone for analysis and the data did not show the same trends with pe at high and low mv. the initial rate was approximately linear with mv, did not saturate and did not fit to michaelis menten kinetics. this suggests significant interaction of mv when pe is present and it was not possible to estimate km or vmax values.

discussion
we have found that lipids have significant influence on multidrug transport. the addition of dope or dopg to a dopc background is able to alter substrate transport by smr proteins by over an order of magnitude. a comparison of two transporters, emre and tbsmr, from bacteria with dissimilar native lipid compositions, reveals commonalities in their lipid dependences.

lipid dependences of the smr family of proteins
the native membranes of emre and tbsmr are of similar composition with pe lipids being the majority constituent closely followed by an anionic lipid. the most abundant anionic lipids in emre native membranes are pg lipids opposed to pi lipids found in native tbsmr membranes. the initial rate of mv transport at low mv concentrations proved a reliable method of comparing the lipid dependences of the two protein activities. mv uptake has been previously used to determine emre function and initial rate values ranging between  <dig> to  <dig>  nmol.min- <dig> mg- <dig> have been reported for emre reconstituted into e. coli vesicles <cit> . the diverse values are attributed to variations in reconstitution methodologies, solubilisation conditions and lipid concentrations. our initial rate values  are in agreement with the lower end of this range of values. in vivo experiments have been utilised to identify smr ligands  <cit>  but limited kinetic characterisation has been undertaken. here, we have investigated how varying lipid compositions, which mimic aspects of the in vivo environments, affect smr transport in vitro.

the incorporation of pe into pc bilayers increases the initial rate of mv transport for both emre and tbsmr up to  <dig>  pe mole fraction . tbsmr is less active in dopc lipid vesicles than emre and shows a smaller, 4-fold increase in transport rate with pe, compared to 20-fold for emre. both proteins also showed rate increases when dopg was added to dopc; about 25-fold for emre and 5-fold for tbsmr. tbsmr showed a larger, 20-fold, increase in rate when its native pi lipid headgroup was added instead of dopg . these results show that a fluid dopc lipid bilayer structure imparts a degree of transport activity to smr proteins. however, transport is suboptimal in dopc and regardless of the lipid added to dopc, an increase in transport rate is observed when the dopc mole fractions falls below  <dig>  . this implies a threshold level of pc of ~ <dig>  mole fraction in binary lipid mixtures, above which transport is hindered. an increase in rate occurs upon addition of pe or an anionic lipid to pc. a faster transport rate still is seen in the absence of pc, but with a combination of pe and the anionic lipid. these are the dominant lipid types in the native membranes: pg/pe for emre and pi/pe for tbsmr, which give ~70-fold and 25-fold increases in initial rate over that in dopc . in this study, synthetic lipids with defined chain compositions were used rather than the mixtures of differing chain length and saturation present in native lipid compositions, thus these varying natural chains could also further enhance transport activity. the data for emre in pc/pg  show that the increase is due to pg increasing the maximum transport rate, vmax. the negative charge of pg or pi is likely to play a role in attracting the positively charged mv substrate. the larger increase in transport observed with pi over pg for tbsmr, presumably reflects a preferential interaction with its native inositol group.

lipid effects on membrane proteins
membrane proteins are heavily influenced by their surrounding lipid environment. specific lipid interactions have been identified with lipids either being seen tightly bound in x-ray structures or a certain lipid being essential for function  <cit> . alternatively, generic bilayer properties can significantly influence protein function  <cit> . key properties include a mis-match between the hydrophobic length of the protein and lipid bilayer as well as the elastic properties of the bilayer, which include curvature energy and lateral pressure. thus, alamethicin channel formation and function has been directly linked to bilayer curvature in pc/pe bilayers  <cit> , folding is also dependent on this curvature and lateral pressure in pc/pe systems  <cit> . here we have shown that pe favours emre or tbsmr transport activity, in an anionic lipid background . although, the greatest influence on transport is the anionic lipid.

lipids have also previously been shown to affect transport function but it is only recently that systematic studies have been undertaken to investigate their effect on integral membrane proteins. e. coli lactose permease is known to be affected by lipids  <cit> , with initial rates of lactose showing similar dependences on pe as reported here for smr proteins. the lactose rate increased upon addition of  <dig>  mole fraction pe to pc. the effect of pg differed to that reported here, as  <dig>  mole fraction pg did not increase the lactose rate, unlike the large 20-fold increase seen here for emre. pe has also been reported to affect the biogenesis, folding and topology of lactose permease and other transporters  <cit> . other multidrug transporters of the major facilitator superfamily  including gabp, phep and lmrp  <cit>  have shown lipid dependencies for function. in the case of lmrp the replacement of pe for pc in the bilayer lead to significant alterations in both structure and function. further studies on lmrp using pe-methylated moieties suggest that direct interactions between the pe headgroup and certain lmrp amino acids are directly involved in ph sensing required for substrate transport  <cit> . there are also some indications that multidrug transporters from other protein families are also dependent on lipid composition. in the case of the atp binding cassette multidrug transporter, p-glycoprotein, drug binding has also been shown to be influenced by lipid environment  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here highlight the importance of investigating the influence of the lipid environment on smr protein activity. the addition of pe to pc bilayers has the same effect on both emre and tbsmr activity demonstrating that the lipid environment of homologous proteins affects their activity in the same manner. overall, these data show that the use of sub-optimal lipid compositions can have a large effect on the transport kinetics and relative substrate affinities obtained during in vitro study of multidrug transport.
