BACKGROUND
at present, antimalarial drug resistance is a critical threat and the need for compounds with novel modes-of-action is imperative. malaria pathogenesis is exhibited during the asexual erythrocytic cycle of plasmodium falciparum in the human host and a variety of parasite processes and diverse targets are potentially available to inhibit parasite proliferation. one of these targets is the biosynthesis of polyamines - essential and ubiquitous small, aliphatic compounds containing two or more amino groups, which in eukaryotes mainly include putrescine, spermidine and spermine  <cit> . a fourth polyamine, cadaverine, is a structural analogue of putrescine with functions similar to the other polyamines though better characterized in prokaryotes  <cit> . at physiological ph, these polycations interact electrostatically with various anionic macromolecules such as dna, rna, atp, phospholipids and proteins  <cit> . these interactions can alter dna conformation, regulate replication and transcription, strengthen membranes, regulate ion channels and protect dna and phospholipids from oxidative stress  <cit> .

ornithine decarboxylase  and s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase  usually regulate polyamine metabolism and inhibitors against these enzymes are being applied in diverse therapies ranging from tumour suppressors to the treatment of west african sleeping sickness , validating polyamine metabolism as a target for drug intervention in these protozoan parasites  <cit> . in p. falciparum adometdc and odc are encoded by a single polypeptide to form a unique bifunctional protein   <cit> . this enzyme has been the main focus of studies assessing polyamine metabolism as a drug target in the parasite. however, traditional inhibitors of the polyamine pathway aimed at these proteins have cytostatic effects with curative rates only achieved in combination with polyamine analogues in murine malaria models  <cit> . a previous study focused on pfadometdc/odc indicated that polyamine depletion resulted in transcriptional arrest  <cit> , which manifested as a halt in the parasite's intraerythrocytic developmental cycle . therefore, polyamines appear to be essential molecules for parasite survival and promising targets for antimalarial therapeutic intervention  <cit> .

spermidine is synthesized from putrescine and decarboxylated s-adenosylmethionine  through the aminopropyltransferase action of spermidine synthase   <cit> . in p. falciparum, this protein has the additional and unique function of being responsible for the low level production of spermine  <cit> . the relative paucity of polyamine studies focused on pfspdsyn may belie the importance and essential nature of this enzyme, reflected by the need for spermidine in the synthesis of hypusine, eukaryotic initiation factor 5a and its involvement in p. falciparum dna polymerase and topoisomerase i and ii  <cit> . in addition, the lack of polyamine interconversion in p. falciparum implicates the flux through pfspdsyn as the determinant of spermidine levels  <cit> . in support of the latter, inhibition of pfspdsyn activity with either substrate or transition state analogues has been shown to totally block p. falciparum schizogony due to depletion of spermidine  <cit> . this contrasts with other cell lines in which growth rates were only moderately affected, due to the maintenance of cellular polyamine levels by the interconversion pathway  <cit> . evidence for the rescue of pfspdsyn inhibition by exogenous polyamines is contradictory and seems to be dependent on the inhibitor used: reversibility was found with the putrescine analogue dicyclohexylamine  <cit>  but not with the more potent inhibitors, trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine  or 5-amino-1-pentene   <cit> .

the modes of gene regulation in p. falciparum is currently controversial, with evidence supporting the dominant role of post-transcriptional control on the one hand  <cit>  and evidence mounting for the presence of transcriptional control, particularly in response to external perturbations on the parasite, on the other  <cit> . a recent functional genomics study of co-inhibited pfadometdc/odc demonstrated that perturbation-specific compensatory transcriptional responses are induced within the parasite to alleviate the effects of polyamine depletion  <cit> , similar to a previous study of odc-inhibited malaria parasites  <cit> . in the investigation presented here, these two studies were extended to analyze the effect of inhibition of pfspdsyn. remarkably, unique inhibitor-specific effects were detected on several levels in this study. moreover, perturbation-specific effects relating to polyamine depletion, as reported in the previous studies, were confirmed, thus corroborating the role of transcriptional regulation in polyamine metabolism of p. falciparum.

RESULTS
morphological study
a number of compounds have been shown to inhibit spermidine synthase activity in p. falciparum  <cit> . some of these drugs include dicyclohexylamine, agmatine,  <dig> -diaminoheptane,  <dig> mcha, ape, -dcadomet, 1-aminoxy-3-aminopropane  and cyclohexylamine. of these, only dicyclohexylamine and cyclohexylamine are commercially available, with cyclohexylamine being more potent and inhibiting p. falciparum growth with an ic <dig> of  <dig> μm compared to  <dig> μm, for dicyclohexylamine  <cit> . the potency of cyclohexylamine was also reflected in its inhibition of recombinantly expressed pfspdsyn . this motivated the use of cyclohexylamine to obtain pfspdsyn inhibition in in vitro p. falciparum cultures and investigate the resultant effects on parasite morphology, transcriptome, proteome and selected polyamine metabolites.

a morphological study was performed on pfspdsyn inhibited parasites to ensure complete growth arrest at the drug concentration used  and to determine sampling times for subsequent transcriptome, proteome and metabolite analyses. drug treatment was initiated during parasite invasion. treated parasites were arrested in the early trophozoite stage, while untreated parasites had matured from early to mid/late trophozoites at  <dig> hours post invasion  . there were no morphologically detectable differences between treated and untreated parasites in the earlier stages , limiting the possibility of off-target effects of the drug treatment prior to pfspdsyn inhibition. these results correlate with findings indicating a stage-specific expression of pfspdsyn with maximum accumulation of transcript and protein in trophozoites at  <dig> hpi  <cit>  , and a morphological visible difference in parasites treated with cyclohexylamine only after pfspdsyn is produced . based on these results, sampling times for subsequent transcriptome and proteome analyses were chosen at early , mid  and late  trophozoite stages, thereby spanning the period in which pfspdsyn is maximally expressed and during which parasite growth arrest is observed. metabolite analyses were performed at  <dig> hpi.

transcriptional profiling of cyclohexylamine-treated p. falciparum
transcriptome analyses of cyclohexylamine-treated compared to untreated parasites employed a reference design  <cit>  for hybridization to an operon oligonucleotide array, interrogating  <dig> 70-mer oligonucleotides which represent  <dig> unique genes. rna was extracted from several untreated, unsynchronized p. falciparum 3d <dig> cultures and cdna synthesized for construction of a universal reference rna  pool resulting in 86% coverage, according to the method of novoradovskaya   <cit> . technical and biological variation between hybridisations was estimated by pearson correlations between the individual slides.  <dig> datapoints  passing the normalisation filters across all arrays  were utilised for this purpose. technical variation was calculated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  across all replicates. biological variation was calculated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  across all biological replicates. all technical and biological correlations are given in full in additional file 1: table s <dig>  pearson correlations  of the relative expression values of the untreated  and treated  samples compared to the reference pool utilised  <dig> spots  in the analyses. the correlations indicated transcriptional arrest in the parasite following cyclohexylamine treatment . this is evident from pearson correlations between treated samples, where t <dig> vs t <dig> =  <dig> , t <dig> vs t <dig> =  <dig>  and t <dig> vs t <dig> =  <dig> , indicating that after cyclohexylamine treatment, parasites were in comparable transcriptional states . in contrast, in untreated samples, where no arrest was observed at a transcriptional or morphological level, correlations between time points were significantly lower . parasite arrest was estimated close to  <dig> hpi, as can be gauged from correlations between untreated and treated samples , which indicate the approximate time of transcriptional arrest  leading to the observed cytostasis . additionally, this cytostasis correlates well with the expression time of pfspdsyn spanning 10- <dig> hpi and reaching maximal expression at  <dig> hpi . the comparison of the cytostatically arrested treated parasites to untreated parasites at  <dig> hpi  is therefore essential to identify differences in the transcriptomes due to drug treatment. parallel time point comparisons indicated lower correlation values  indicating the presence of cell cycle differences between these populations and negating the use of direct time point comparisons. these results are in strong agreement with those obtained by van brummelen   <cit> , where the combination of two cytostatic drugs that target the polyamine pathway also resulted in a global transcriptional arrest after polyamine depletion. subsequently, for analysis of significantly affected transcripts, all samples were compared to ut <dig>  thereby following a reference point strategy similar to previous reports  <cit> , such that drug-specific events were observed and not only cell cycle/stage differences.

following analysis of differentially expressed transcripts with the limma package in r, it emerged that a total of  <dig> unique genes  were differentially regulated  at least two-fold when applying a false discovery rate cutoff of 5% . this amounted to  <dig> % of the total unique plasmodb identities passing the data normalization and quality filter  on the array and included  <dig> downregulated and  <dig> upregulated transcripts. the largest number of transcripts differentially expressed occurred at t <dig> , declining to  <dig> at t <dig> and  <dig> at t <dig> . several of these transcripts were differentially expressed at multiple time points.

the transcriptome data was validated by examining relative expression of five transcripts functioning in the polyamine/methionine biosynthetic pathway with quantitative real-time pcr  analyses. primers were designed to specifically amplify adenosine deaminase , ldc , uridine phosphorylase , phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase  and spermidine synthase . eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit  <dig>  was used as endogenous control, since its transcript was not affected by the drug perturbation throughout the time period analyzed, as deduced from array data  and the malaria idc strain comparison database  <cit> . rt-qpcr data was in strong agreement with that obtained from array analyses , as indicated by a pearson correlation value of  <dig>  for the two datasets. rt-qpcr analyses confirmed the direction of differential regulation  as well as where transcripts were deemed to be unchanged by the perturbation . downregulated transcripts showed good concordance between oligonucleotide array and rt-qpcr analyses . similarly, upregulated transcripts showed good concordance, albeit with a smaller fold-change in rt-qpcr analyses .

the array and quantitative real-time pcr  datasets showed a high degree of concordance revealed by a pearson correlation  of  <dig> . fold changes for transcripts and proteins are given at each time point. differentially affected genes and their cognate proteins generally exhibited the same direction and level of regulation.

drug-induced changes to the p. falciparum proteome
to further investigate the effect of the cyclohexylamine perturbation on p. falciparum, global protein expression analyses was also performed using 2d gel electrophoresis . similar to the transcriptome analyses, differential analyses were obtained by comparing drug-treated proteome profiles of the parasites at the three time points  to the protein profile of untreated parasites at  <dig> hpi. using pdquest , a total of  <dig> protein spots were successfully matched with high confidence  across three replicate gels representing the parasite's entire  <dig> hpi untreated proteome. of these,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> spots were matched with high confidence to corresponding 2d-ge spots representing the parasite's drug-treated proteome at  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi, and  <dig> hpi respectively. statistical analysis revealed a total of  <dig> differentially expressed proteins with at least a two-fold change and a statistical significance of p =  <dig>  . the identities of  <dig> of these were positively established through maldi-qtof-ms and ms/ms  . four of these were found to be involved in the polyamine/methionine biosynthetic pathway, namely ornithine aminotransferase , s-adenosylmethionine synthetase , uridine phosphorylase, putative  and adenosine deaminase . it was not possible to establish the identities of  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed proteins, due to their low abundance being beyond the detection limits of the mass spectrometer used. however, the successful identification using mass spectrometry of  <dig> out of the  <dig> differentially expressed proteins selected for characterization  compared well to previous 2d-ge studies of plasmodial proteins which displayed an identification rate of approximately 30%  <cit> .

inhibition of spdsyn in p. falciparum resulted in a general downregulation in expressed proteins. expression of all but one ) of the  <dig> differentially affected proteins identified was found to be downregulated. of these, six displayed a similar direction of differential expression with their corresponding genes, even though the expression levels varied . for  <dig> downregulated proteins, no significant change in underlying gene expression was observed following treatment, while in the case of the putative pyruvate kinase , increased accumulation of this protein was detected in contrast to a relative reduction in underlying levels of mrna. in previous studies, moderately high correlation between mrna and protein abundance has been shown for p. falciparum, varying in degree of correlation according to the parasite's stage-specific development  <cit> . however, this effect is not observed for all proteins and their encoding genes, and it has been proposed that this discrepancy in part reflects the contribution of more complex regulatory processing involving post-transcriptional mechanisms and/or protein peptide modification  <cit> . thus, in the case of the putative pyruvate kinase  for example, in-depth analysis to determine the modification status of this sequence at the gene and protein level may shed more light on the contrasting changes observed in expression.

selected metabolite profiling of cyclohexylamine-treated p. falciparum
information regarding the effect of pfspdsyn inhibition on the polyamine profile of p. falciparum is still lacking. to investigate polyamine perturbations resulting from treatment of p. falciparum with cyclohexylamine, selected metabolite profiling was performed on these parasites. hplc analyses of polyamines of both cyclohexylamine-treated and untreated p. falciparum trophozoites  revealed significant fluctuations in the polyamine content of the parasites . a significant increase  in the pfspdsyn substrate putrescine was observed after inhibition. pfspdsyn inhibition also led to depletion in the levels of the downstream product metabolites, spermidine and spermine ; spermine:  <dig> -fold decrease ). levels of the related polyamine, cadaverine, were assessed to investigate whether a compensatory increase in this metabolite occurs due to induction of ldc transcripts. levels appeared to be increased but the change was not statistically significant.

perturbation responses include polyamine and associated pathways
differentially affected transcripts and proteins were analyzed in madiba  <cit>  to ascertain which metabolic pathways were affected by cyclohexylamine challenge. all differentially regulated genes/proteins at each time point were submitted as a cluster. generally, gene clusters submitted for analyses following clustering are smaller than either of the lists of differentially down- or upregulated genes at each time point  to  <dig> ). hence, larger p-values were expected from the contingency test . nonetheless, the polyamine biosynthetic pathway ranked among the pathways most affected  by cyclohexylamine treatment by analyzing the transcriptome data . this effect on the polyamine pathway was confirmed for differentially expressed proteins . the lower p-values for differentially affected pathways elucidated by proteomics analysis were expected since the proteome coverage was not as extensive as the transcriptome analysis  and therefore a smaller amount of proteins were submitted to the contingency test . comparatively, the glycolytic pathway was scored at  <dig>  and  <dig>   and oxidative phosphorylation at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   within the transcriptome dataset. for the proteome, the glycolytic score was  <dig>  for both t <dig> and t <dig>  and not affected at t <dig> 

differentially affected transcripts and their cognate proteins mapping to the polyamine biosynthetic pathway included adenosine deaminase  and - <dig>   downregulated) and uridine phosphorylase  and - <dig>   downregulated) . transcripts encoding ldc  were also affected. furthermore, genes acting in pathways directly linked to the polyamine pathway were differentially regulated. these included four transcripts , inorganic pyrophosphatase, putative , protein with aminophospholipid-transporting p-atpase and guanyl cyclase domains  and thioredoxin reductase ) in the purine metabolic pathway and five methyltransferases , s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, putative , methyl transferase-like protein, putative , protein-l-isoaspartate o-methyltransferase beta-aspartate methyltransferase, putative  and n6-adenine-specific methylase, putative ) . additional significantly affected proteins functioning in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway included ornithine aminotransferase  and s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  . transcripts for the latter were also downregulated but not to the extent of the 2-fold cutoff .

data obtained in this study was compared to that from two previous profiling experiments involving polyamine biosynthetic inhibitors namely dfmo  and dfmo/mdl <dig> . a large degree of overlap was observed for differentially expressed genes and proteins, but effects specific to each treatment were also identified . indeed,  <dig> upregulated transcripts in the pfspdsyn inhibition dataset were also observed in the pfadometdc/odc dataset . moreover, this number was increased to  <dig> for overlapping downregulated genes . six transcripts of the polyamine pathway were affected in exactly the same manner, whether pfspdsyn was inhibited with cyclohexylamine  or whether the bifunctional pfadometdc/odc were co-inhibited with dfmo/mdl <dig> ; upregulated: ldc ; and downregulated: uridine phosphorylase , adenosine deaminase , s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  and adenosylhomocysteinase  ). conversely, transcripts differentially regulated amongst the three treatments were oat , odc and pfadometdc/odc inhibition: upregulated), pfadometdc/odc  and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase .

a large degree of overlap was observed for the response to polyamine depletion, whether pfspdsyn, pfadometdc/odc or odc alone were inhibited. also, effects specific to each inhibitor could be gauged.

discussion
in this investigation, cyclohexylamine treatment of p. falciparum parasites resulted in a perturbation-specific response due to polyamine depletion  as well as an inhibitor-specific response due to spermidine synthase inhibition on the transcriptional level . these responses will be discussed at the level of the specific polyamine biosynthetic enzymes in more detail.

ldc
in a previous investigation, inhibition of both decarboxylase activities of the bifunctional pfadometdc/odc led to the marked upregulation of ldc over a time course  <cit> . pfspdsyn inhibition also led to an increase in transcripts encoding ldc, albeit only in one time point in array analyses, and not to the extent of the two-fold cutoff in rt-qpcr analyses. this upregulation of ldc is regarded as a specific compensatory response to polyamine metabolism perturbation resulting in polyamine depletion. lysine decarboxylation produces cadaverine, a diamine and structural analogue of putrescine, presumably to compensate for the lack of other polyamines as has been shown in plants and partially in plasmodium  <cit> .

adenosine deaminase and uridine phosphorylase
as expected, downstream enzymes whose function is dependent on the metabolism of polyamines, including adenosine deaminase and uridine phosphorylase, were downregulated upon perturbation of polyamine metabolism on both transcript and protein levels. these were also affected upon pfadometdc/odc co-inhibition  <cit> . therefore, the decreased production of 5-methylthioadenosine, a substrate for adenosine deaminase, after polyamine depletion  <cit> , possibly resulted in a regulatory signal to decrease the production of this protein at the transcriptional level. consequently, this downregulation may explain the observed decrease in 5-methylinosine following pfadometdc/odc co-inhibition  <cit> , which manifests in the downregulation of the production of uridine phosphorylase. ultimately, the downregulation of these proteins would result in the decreased production of precursors for purine metabolism as well as methionine synthesis.

oat
during the inhibition of odc or the co-inhibition of both decarboxylase activities of the bifunctional pfadometdc/odc  <cit>  an upregulation in both the transcript and protein for oat was observed, potentially to prevent toxic accumulation of ornithine when this metabolite was not used for polyamine production. this was clearly confirmed with a metabolomic analysis which indicated the total depletion of putrescine levels due to the abovementioned inhibition and a homeostatic maintenance of ornithine levels  <cit> . however, upon inhibition of pfsdpsyn, this compensatory increase in oat transcripts or protein was not observed, which corroborates its specific upregulation when ornithine decarboxylation is prevented.

it would be predicted that inhibition of pfspdsyn would result in an increase in putrescine concentrations in the parasite and a marked decrease in spermidine concentrations. metabolite analyses of p. falciparum confirmed that inhibition of pfspdsyn results in a substantial increase in putrescine concentration. moreover, a decrease was observed in spermidine and spermine concentrations. p. falciparum lacks a spermine synthase activity but pfspdsyn has been shown to uniquely metabolize its product, spermidine, to additionally provide spermine . the observation of a decrease in spermine levels after pfspdsyn inhibition with cyclohexylamine therefore confirms this secondary activity of the protein.

pfadometdc/odc
the co-inhibition of the bifunctional pfadometdc/odc resulted in a downregulation of the transcript for this protein  <cit> . this effect was not mirrored by pfspdsyn - the transcript for this protein was not differentially affected and, moreover, putrescine levels increased. therefore, it seems as if an increase in this metabolite  does not trigger the regulation of pfadometdc/odc.

methionine recycling
inhibition of pfspdsyn resulted in a decrease in transcripts for proteins involved in methionine recycling. pfspdsyn inhibition could presumably also have caused an increase in the decarboxylated form of adomet as a product of adometdc. decarboxylated adomet is exclusively used in the synthesis of polyamines  <cit>  and as such, its homeostasis is controlled only by polyamine and methionine metabolism. after co-inhibition of pfadometdc/odc  <cit> , it was shown that adomet levels were homeostatically controlled in the parasite, presumably to prevent a hypermethylated state. the mechanism proposed for the homeostatic control of adomet levels in plasmodia is the downregulation of its synthesis, effectively by downregulating the synthesis of adomet synthetase  <cit> . this downregulation was also observed on both transcript and protein levels in this study after pfspdsyn inhibition.

three independent profiling investigations of different polyamine biosynthesis inhibitors indicated highly reproducible perturbation-specific results, as well as specific effects related to the inhibitors used. these findings lend support to the growing body of evidence that implicates a role for transcriptional level control in the response of p. falciparum to drug perturbation. the findings further highlight that this organism demonstrates an ability to mount a compensatory response following drug perturbation of the polyamine pathway. for p. falciparum, an organism noted for it's adeptness to developing drug resistance, such knowledge is critical to guiding the future direction of drug development strategies seeking to target the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. it is also becoming clear that the phenomenon of directed transcriptional level response to perturbation may occur in select biological processes within the parasite, e.g. in the case of antifolate inhibition such events are not observed  <cit> . this suggests the presence of a highly complex regulatory system which still remains to be fully elucidated, where the dominant regulation may occur at the transcriptional level for some genes, whereas for others it may occur at the post-transcriptional and/or translational level. recent advances in microarray and mass spectrometry technologies, which now enable simultaneous and in-depth high-throughput analysis of such events, promise to provide greater insight into these phenomena.

CONCLUSIONS
in this investigation, the consequences of inhibiting spdsyn in p. falciparum were evaluated on several levels. unique polyamine biosynthetic effects, specific to the inhibition of pfspdsyn, were observed. these effects stem from the specific polyamines perturbed; in this instance the inhibition of the formation of spermidine and spermine. by providing detailed analyses of the consequences of pfspdsyn inhibition, this work also contributes to efforts aiming to identify drug targets most suited to chemotherapeutic intervention in this pathway.
