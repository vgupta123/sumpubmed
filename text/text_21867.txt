BACKGROUND
exposure to certain kinds of environmental stress factors, such as chemical, heat, osmotic, etc., induces living organisms to express stress proteins, thereby enabling the organism to acquire stress tolerance. this phenomenon is called the "stress response". especially, the heat-inducible proteins termed "heat-shock proteins " constitute an important part of the stress-responsive proteins  <cit> . hsp70s  were discovered in drosophila melanogaster, and their homologs have been found in various organisms including yeast  <cit> . hsp70s also function as molecular chaperones  <cit> . in the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, there are ca.  <dig> hsp70-like genes. the ssa, ssb and sse families are cytosolic hsp <dig>  <cit> , whereas the ssc <dig> is localized to the mitochondria  <cit> . in addition, kar <dig>  is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the ssa family contains  <dig> genes, ssa <dig>  ssa <dig>  ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  <cit> . not only are the ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> genes constitutively expressed, they are also 96% identical at the nucleotide level  <cit> . moreover, there is no change in the phenotype of deletion in either of the ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> genes compared with the wild-type. in addition, they do not show thermotolerance without pre-heat treatment at 37°c  <cit> . however, the ssa1/ <dig> double deletion mutant acquires thermotolerance even at 23°c, and shows a slow growth rate  <cit> . a suppressor, exa3- <dig> which is an allele of hsf <dig> encoding a heat shock factor  <cit>  recovers its growth rate. this phenomenon in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant is speculated to result from the overexpression of certain hsps  <cit> . hsp <dig> and ssa <dig> are found to be highly expressed in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant  <cit> .

ssa <dig> is involved in protein transport and the rescue of denatured proteins  <cit> , and possesses atpase activity  <cit> . sti1p activates atpase activity of ssa1p  <cit> . in addition, hsp <dig> is a co-chaperone with hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> in both s. cerevisiae and e.coli  <cit> . the relationship between these chaperones and human misfolding disease has been shown  <cit> . on the other hand, ssa <dig> is involved in protein transport into the vacuole  <cit> . thus, ssa <dig> is multi-functional, and the ssa1/ <dig> double deletion mutant shows drastic changes needed to acquire thermotolerance, which is similar to the mild heat-shocked wild-type. as ssa1p and ssa2p are cytosolic molecular chaperones, it is hypothesized that unfolded proteins appear by the double deletion of ssa1/ <dig> 

however, genome-wide expression analysis of the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant using cdna microarray has not been carried out. we believe that gene expression profiling of the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant is necessary not only to describe the genomic response developed by yeast to the deletions, but also to reveal the mechanism of the response to denatured proteins. to support the cdna microarray data, we also performed rt-pcr, and immunoblot analysis of several yeast proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis . we demonstrate that the deletion of ssa1/ <dig> genes induces up-regulation of the genes involved in both protein degradation and synthesis, whereas mild heat shock induces upr.

RESULTS
comparison of the mrna expression profiles between the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant and the mild heat-shocked wild-type
to investigate the mechanism of the response to denatured proteins comprehensively, the mrna expression profiling of the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant was carried out using yeast cdna microarray, in comparison with the mild heat-shocked wild-type. the number of up-regulated genes in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant was  <dig>  while that in the mild heat-shocked wild-type by exposure for  <dig> and  <dig> min at 43°c was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the functionally categorized up-regulated genes are shown in figs. 1a and 2a. the most highly up-regulated genes were categorized into "cell rescue, defense, and virulence " in both ssa1/ <dig> and mild heat-shocked wild-type, of which the rates were 8% and 10%, respectively. on the other hand, the number of down-regulated genes in ssa1/ <dig> was  <dig>  while that in the mild heat-shocked wild-type by exposure for  <dig> and  <dig> min at 43°c was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the functionally categorized down-regulated genes are shown in figs. 1b and 2b.

in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, the percentages of up-regulated genes categorized in "cell rescue defense and virulence", "transport facilitation" and "protein fate" was approximately 2– <dig> times larger than those of the down-regulated genes , and the opposite results were found in "cellular communication/signal transduction mechanism" category . in the mild heat-shocked wild-type, there were no categories in which the percentages of up-regulated genes were over 2-times larger than those of the down-regulated genes . however, the percentage of down-regulated genes in "protein synthesis" was particularly larger  than that of the up-regulated genes . thus, the number of up-regulated genes in "protein synthesis" was remarkably smaller than that of the down-regulated genes in the heat-shocked wild type. conversely, in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, the number of up-regulated genes in "protein synthesis" was larger than that of the down-regulated genes. therefore, we focused on protein synthesis and correlated protein fate as well as "cell rescue, defense and virulence" in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant.

*the expression levels are the average value of three independent experiments.

on the other hand, in the category of "protein fate", the pre <dig>  rpn <dig>  rpn <dig> and scl <dig> genes that encode for cytosolic proteasome subunits, were found to be up-regulated in ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant . in addition, the ubc <dig>  gene was also up-regulated. table  <dig> shows the expression level of the genes involved in protein degradation. these results suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway is activated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. although a few ubiquitin-proteasome genes  were up-regulated in the mild heat-shocked wild-type, they were not in common with those up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant . the proteasome genes up-regulated in the mild heat-shocked wild-type included vacuolar protein genes , and unfolded protein response  genes  .

confirmatory rt-pcr for proteolytic degradation- and ribosomal biogenesis-related genes
to verify that both protein synthesis and degradation are activated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, rt-pcr analysis of several proteolytic degradation genes and cytosolic ribosomal protein genes was carried out. proteasome subunit genes , an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene , and cytosolic ribosomal protein genes were found to be up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant compared with the wild-type . this result supports the cdna microarray data showing that both ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation and protein synthesis were activated by deletion of the ssa1/ <dig> genes. only kar <dig> was highly expressed among the upr genes .

immunoblot analysis of proteolytic degradation-related gene products
to confirm that ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation is activated at the translational level in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, immunoblot analysis was performed. pre1p  and rpn4p  increased in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant compared with the wild-type . an anti-multi ubiquitin mouse monoclonal antibody   <cit>  detects only ubiquitin that is covalently bound to substrate proteins, i.e. ubiquitinated proteins, and not free ubiquitin  <cit> . ubiquitinated proteins especially with molecular weights less than  <dig> kda increased in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant in comparison with the wild-type .

discussion
in the present study, we reveal global differences in gene expression between yeast cells lacking two cytosolic hsp70s, ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  and the mild-heat-shocked wild-type using cdna microarray technologoly.

results from cdna microarray analysis reveal that the stress-inducible protein genes, including molecular chaperones, were up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant in a similar fashion as seen in the mild heat-shocked wild-type . it is clear that thermotolerance is due to expression of these stress-inducible proteins. in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, hsf <dig> suppressing growth rate of the ssa1/ <dig>  <cit>  was expressed normally and its expression level was unchanged . several genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway were up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant . ubc <dig>  <cit>  was also up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, which is consistent with a previous report  <cit> . ubc4/ <dig> is necessary for binding between the substrates and lys <dig> of ubiquitin that is a target of the  <dig> s proteasome  <cit> , and for binding between the substrates and lys <dig> of ubiquitin, that is not a target of the  <dig> s proteasome. in addition to ubc <dig>  we found up-regulation of several proteasome genes  in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. pre <dig> and scl <dig> encode  <dig> s proteasome, and rpn <dig> and rpn <dig> encode  <dig> s proteasome  <cit> . rpn <dig>  is a factor involved in erad   <cit> . all these genes are essential for degradation of the ubiquitinated proteins  <cit> . rt-pcr data support the up-regulation of these proteasome genes by the deletion of ssa1/ <dig> . moreover, we confirmed that pre1p and rpn4p were up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant at the translational level by immunoblotting . this result provided further evidence that proteolytic degradation by proteasomes was stimulated by the deletion of ssa1/ <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  more ubiquitinated proteins, especially with molecular weights less than  <dig> kda, were detected in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant than in the wild-type. the deletion of ubp <dig> in ssa1/ <dig> has been reported to lead to a significant increase in the number of the ubiquitinated proteins, mainly with molecular weights of more than  <dig> kda  <cit> . the expression level of ubp <dig> did not change in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant compared with the wild-type . therefore, the increase of ubiquitinated proteins in ssa1/ <dig> is not caused by the deletion of ubp <dig>  there are two possibilities for the increase of ubiquitinated proteins in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. first, insufficiency of the upr in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant may lead to activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation system. thus, ubiquitination of the target proteins increases and the expression of proteasome genes is induced. second, some defect of deubiquitination occurs in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, consequently leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the cell followed by cell death. furthermore, proteolytic degradation by proteasomes is facilitated. on the other hand, we found that several genes encoding ribosomal proteins were up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant , implying that protein synthesis is activated by the deletion of ssa1/ <dig> 

in case of the mild heat-shocked wild-type, genes involved in protein synthesis were significantly suppressed , and the proteasome genes up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant did not show any change in their expression levels . instead, some upr genes  were up-regulated , implying that upr occurs during mild heat-shock. the mechanism of upr is known to induce the up-regulation of er chaperones for refolding when unfolded proteins accumulate in the er  <cit> . in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, the expression of three upr genes  remained unchanged , and only kar <dig> was up-regulated .

gasch et al. has reported the genome-wide expression analysis of yeast cells exposed to environmental changes  <cit> . we compared our data on the mild heat shocked wild-type yeast cells with their data on the wild-type cells shifted to 37°c from 25°c. the stress-inducible protein genes up-regulated in the mild-heat shocked wild type   are in common with the results obtained by gasch et al.  <cit> . in the category of "protein fate", more than 70% of the up-regulated genes in our experiments are also in common with their results  <cit> , even though there is a time lag with their experiments. however, der <dig>  one of the upr genes, was not found to be up-regulated in their study during the entire the heat-shock treatment period  <cit> . in contrast, der <dig> was up-regulated in our experiments . this may be due to the difference in the temperature and time of heat-shock treatment. on the other hand, in the category of "protein synthesis", ribosomal protein genes are significantly suppressed in their experiments  <cit> , which is consistent with our data. from these comparisons, it can be said that our data on the mild heat-shocked wild-type is similar to that reported by gasch et al.  <cit>  in the categories of "cell rescue, defense, and virulence", "protein fate" and "protein synthesis".

it is reasonable that upr is activated and protein synthesis is suppressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type. we speculate on the reasons as to why the genes involved in both protein degradation and protein synthesis are up-regulated in ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. in the normal state, proteins are synthesized on the ribosome, followed by post-translational modifications in the er or the golgi apparatus to finally become mature and functional entitles. schubert et al  <cit>  showed that 30% of the de novo synthesized proteins are degraded before coming to maturity. therefore, it can be reasoned that post-translational protein denaturation occurs moderately even under normal conditions. however, organisms have developed several mechanisms in their response to the denatured proteins. upr is one of the er quality control mechanisms  <cit> . in addition, the refolding of denatured proteins is carried out by cytosolic chaperones  <cit> , including ssa1/ <dig>  <cit> . it can be hypothesized that the deletion of ssa1/ <dig> leads to the suppression of refolding, which is then followed by an accumulation of the denatured proteins in cells. the genes involved in proteolytic degradation may be up-regulated to remove such denatured proteins. however, if the ubiquitin-proteasome system keeps on degrading proteins, the depletion of the proteins essential for growth and development will occur. it is suggested that protein synthesis is activated to supply the proteins deleted by proteolytic degradation in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, several hexose transporter genes , and the genes that belong to early part of glycolysis  were up-regulated . the expression of these genes, involved in energy generation, may be required for sustaining the increased protein synthesis in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. hxt genes up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant are low-glucose dependent  <cit> . it is possible that the uptake of glucose is activated to generate energy, because energy is consumed by protein synthesis that is induced by the deletion of ssa1/ <dig> 

these results indicate that different mechanisms of the response to denatured proteins are employed between the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant and the mild heat-shocked wild-type even though several up-regulated hsps  are common between the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant and the mild heat-shocked wild-type . when hsp104p, ydj1p , and ssa1p exist together, their chaperone activities increase significantly  <cit> . from this, it is suggested that the deletion of ssa1/ <dig> induces the suppression of their chaperone activities. recently, the cooperation of hsp26p wih hsp104p/hsp70p/hsp40p chaperone system on protein disaggregation in yeast was reported  <cit> . hsp26p co-aggregated with substrate is suggested to be a target of the hsp104p/hsp70p/hsp40p chaperone system  <cit> . although ssa1p is able to disaggregate the early hsp26p-substrate complex , hsp104p is essential in refolding the late hsp26p-substrate complex   <cit> . moreover, excess or stoichiometric hsp26p against denatured substrates is essential for effective refolding  <cit> . in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, an increase in the mrna expression levels of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> was seen . although the refolding of denatured proteins is sure to succeed if hsp104/hsp104p and hsp26/hsp26p are highly expressed, it is a fact that the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system is facilitated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. it can be speculated that as constitutive protein denaturation occurs, the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system is required in addition to the chaperone refolding system in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant. furthermore, there is a possibility that protein refolding by molecular chaperones and ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation are related. in mammalian cells, the following model has been reported; denatured proteins are refolded by hsp70-hsp <dig> chaperone-mediated maturation pathway under the treatment of hsp <dig> inhibitor, and then denatured proteins are degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome  <cit> . it is interesting to note that the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation system in yeast is induced when the chaperone function is inhibited by the deletion of ssa1/ <dig>  however, at present, our data are not sufficient to propose a similar model in yeast, and this remains a topic for future study.

CONCLUSIONS
the protein synthesis and ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system were up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, whereas upr genes were up-regulated but protein synthesis was strongly suppressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type. these results suggest that the mechanism for rescue of denatured proteins in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant differs from that in the mild heat-shocked wild-type, although the phenomena on acquisition of thermotolerance are similar.
