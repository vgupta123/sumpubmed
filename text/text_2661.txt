BACKGROUND
triticum aestivum  is one of the most important cultivated species in the world and it has been subject of intense research. investigations of its genome structure led to the discovery of its highly dynamic nature during evolution. using fossil records and phylogenetic studies, its evolution was traced from ancestral diploid species proposed to originate 50– <dig> million years ago   <cit> . indeed, bread wheat is a hexaploid species made of three homoeologous genomes called a, b and d which derived from different diploid species. these are proposed to be triticum urartu  and a diploid species related to aegilops speltoides  which gave rise some  <dig>  ~  <dig>  mya ago to triticum durum . about  <dig>  years ago, hybridization occurred between triticum durum and aegilops tauschii  and yielded triticum aestivum , the hexaploid wheat  <cit> . this means that every single gene is expected to be found in triplicate. the genome structure, organized in homoeologous genomes a, b and d, has to be maintained through cell division, a function which is ensured by the ph <dig> suppressor locus. the ph <dig> locus restricts homoeologous recombination and permits proper chromosome segregation in a hexaploid context through mitosis and meiosis  <cit> .

complementary approaches known as comparative genomics  <cit>  at the genome-level  or the chromosome level  were used to predict the genome structure of wheat in comparison to sequenced diploid species such as rice  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , maize  <cit> , brachypodium  <cit>  and more recently barley  <cit> . recent syntenic studies proposed that the ancestral genome of grass species was a diploid species organized in five chromosomes   <cit> . from this initial chromosome organization, the ancestral diploid genome was duplicated through whole-genome duplication  then fragmented giving rise to an intermediate ancestor with 2n = 2× =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . this genomic structure has been well conserved in rice  while it evolved to 2n = 2× =  <dig> through chromosome rearrangements in diploid wheat. although wgd is expected to have had a large impact on wheat genome evolution it is not the only mode of genome rearrangement. indeed, duplication of large chromosomal regions , duplication at the gene level or tandem duplications have also occurred in the course of evolution  <cit> . furthermore, it is now well established that wheat genome organization has been largely influenced by transposable element mobilization  <cit> . most of the mechanisms described above increase genome size and lead to an elevated gene copy number. however, much less is known about reverse mechanisms, which reduce genome size to restore a diploid situation and reform single copy gene states. indeed, early studies in saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that only 12% of the duplicate pairs remain after wgd suggesting that an extensive gene loss occurs after wgd  <cit> . in flowering plants, a fraction of single-copy genes were recently investigated and new hypotheses were suggested  <cit> : basically, after duplication, genes within one of the duplicated segments tend to be lost through small deletions while most genes are retained within the second segment, a mechanism known as fractionation bias  <cit> . another difference occurring after duplication between two genomic segments is known as genome dominance during which one of the two segments shows higher expression levels than the other  <cit> . data from maize and brassica further indicate that both gene fractionation, leading to extensive gene loss, and genome dominance are occurring simultaneously keeping the expression of the retained genes at elevated levels  <cit> . hexaploid wheat does not show an overall genome-wide transcriptional dominance of a, b or d subgenomes although some homoeologous genes can adopt a specific expression pattern  <cit> . all these recent outcomes reveal important genome dynamics, which affect genome size or organization and alter gene expression. however, mechanisms implicated in these phenomena remain largely hypothetical, although epigenetic mechanisms have been suggested to provide means to induce asymmetric levels of expression between the two duplicated fragments prior to gene fractionation  <cit> .

although our knowledge about the hexaploid wheat genome structure is increasing, it remains challenging to decipher every step leading to its large genome size of about 16– <dig> gb, which includes up to 80% of repeated sequences  <cit> . in polyploid genomes like cotton, rapeseed or wheat, several studies suggested the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in maintaining genome structure and chromatin stability as well as in regulating gene expression after hybridization and polyploidization  <cit> . one of these epigenetic mechanisms is dna methylation, which takes place at the carbon- <dig> cytosine residues in cg, chg and chh  contexts  <cit> . loss of dna methylation causes reactivation of silenced transposable elements  <cit>  and the expression of certain genes, such as fwa, a gene involved in flowering  <cit> . dna methylation is also known to affect crossover rate and meiotic recombination  <cit> .

we wanted to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the hexaploid wheat species triticum aestivum using the example of met <dig>  a gene encoding methyltransferase  <dig> , responsible for dna methylation maintenance in the cg context. met <dig> is a gene of particular importance for genome maintenance in many organisms, which we hypothesize will be a crucial component of epigenetic mechanisms controlling transposable elements that in wheat make up to 80% of the genome. to date met <dig> gene function have been described in several plant species including arabidopsis  <cit> , maize  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and brassica  <cit>  but not in wheat. we identified met <dig> genes in hexaploid wheat . nine copies of tamet <dig> are organized in three paralogous groups at chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> suggesting that the genomic regions including met <dig> genes were subjected to two duplication events prior to the emergence of hexaploid wheat. considering tamet <dig> genomic regions specifically, we confirmed that the first gene duplication was part of a wgd common to all grass species and that the second duplication occurred through gene duplication specific to the triticeae tribe. expression profiles of the different met <dig> gene copies, estimation of their evolution rates, cg enrichment and methylation profiles highlight the predominance of group  <dig> homoeologous genes at the transcript level. our results exemplify the high dynamics of genome evolution in the course of the evolutionary history of bread wheat and suggest the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in these processes.

RESULTS
hexaploid wheat contains nine tamet1loci
in order to determine the number and complete sequence of tamet <dig> genes, we chose a genomic strategy based on a combination of sequence capture and in silico mining of available wheat genome sequences. in order to define probes on the sequence capture microarray, tamet1-expressed tags  were identified in wheat databases. eight ests were retrieved from public and private libraries. the alignment of these ests with the rice and brachypodium met <dig> genes showed that these ests mapped to the 3′end of tamet <dig> genes. two tamet <dig> ests as well as two brachypodium met <dig> genomic fragments were selected and used to design probes for sequence capture . two successive runs of sequence capture yielded  <dig>  reads specific to tamet <dig> genes. genomic fragments were then assembled de novo using gsassembler in six large contigs corresponding to six putative tamet <dig> genes. however some reads remained impossible to assemble and could not be included within the six large contigs suggesting the possible existence of additional copies of tamet <dig>  in parallel, the draft genome assembly of the wheat genome released by brenchley and collaborators  <cit>  was mined for tamet <dig> genes. however, no full-length sequences corresponding to tamet <dig> genes were present in the dataset. taking advantage of the recent release of sequence surveys from the international wheat genome sequencing consortium   that were produced from sorted chromosome arms  <cit> , blastn analyses against each chromosome arm were performed using rice and brachypodium met <dig> genes. eventually nine met <dig> copies were identified and assigned to chromosomes 2a/2b/2d, 5a/5b/5d and 7a/7b/7d. for simplicity, homoeologous chromosomes a, b and d will be collectively referred to as a “homoeologous group” hereafter. intron and exon junctions were defined for the nine tamet <dig> genes according to rice and brachypodium met <dig> genes and subsequently validated by rna-seq analysis . protein domains were then predicted using the pfam database. three major protein domains were identified that include dnmt1-rfd , bah  and the dna methyltransferase  domain . comparison with met <dig> genes from rice orthologs showed an overall conservation of the tamet <dig> genes . coding sequence analyses revealed that the tamet <dig> genes of chromosome 5a and 5d display deletions and premature stop codons  and if expressed produce truncated proteins missing the dna methyltransferase domain. tamet-5a <dig> and 5d <dig> may be considered as pseudogenes, while all the remaining genes are expected to be functional.figure  <dig>

tamet1loci originated from two successive duplication events
in a first attempt to understand the genome rearrangements, which have led to the nine tamet <dig> genes present in the t. aestivum genome, we retraced the phylogenetic history of tamet <dig> genes using met <dig> orthologs from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. two distinct copies of met <dig>  are usually found in monocots such as rice, sorghum and brachypodium species. phylogenetic analysis suggests that homoeologous tamet <dig> genes from group  <dig> are orthologous to osmet1b on chromosome  <dig> while homoeologous tamet <dig> genes from group  <dig> and  <dig> are orthologous to osmet1a on chromosome  <dig> . hereafter, these two phylogenetic groups are called met-1a and met-1b lineages in respect to the met <dig> genes from rice. the phylogenetic tree suggests that a first duplication event occurred early during monocot speciation resulting in the met-1a and the met-1b lineages . since these two copies of met <dig> are common to all grass species, the first tamet <dig> duplication is likely to be a consequence of the wgd that took place in all grasses and occurred about 56– <dig> mya. the second duplication is shared only within the triticea tribe . since wheat diverged from brachypodium 32– <dig> mya and from barley 10– <dig> mya  <cit> , this second duplication probably occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> mya. in order to understand if this duplication was the result of segmental or single gene duplication, syntenic relationships between regions surrounding the tamet <dig> genes from chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> and their orthologous loci in rice and brachypodium were investigated. for chromosome 5a, 5b and 5d, up to 80% of the genes were conserved, whereas only 10-15% were for group  <dig>  suggesting that a single gene duplication occurred . this hypothesis is consistent with the evolutionary model of grass genomes  <cit> .figure  <dig>

phylogenetic trees in flowering plants and syntenic conservation. a) maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree. the ml tree was inferred using cdna sequences from dicot species including arabidopsis thaliana , brassica rapa , pisum sativum , medicago truncatula: , daucus carota , nicotiana tabacum , solanum lycopersicum , and monocot species including sorghum bicolor , zea mays , oriza sativa , brachypodium distachyon , hordeum vulgare  and triticum aestivum: tamet-2a <dig>  2b <dig>  2d <dig>  5a <dig>  5b <dig>  5d <dig>  7a <dig>  7b <dig> and 7d <dig> . numbers above branches indicate bootstrap values. two monophyletic groups were defined and called the met-1a and met-1b lineages according to the osmet1a and osmet1b genes . the two gene duplication events observed in wheat and barley are indicated by an arrow. b) micro-synteny analysis. micro-synteny was established by blastn analysis between genes from brachypodium, rice and iwgsc sequences from wheat chromosomes as described in methods. syntenic conservation between rice  and brachypodium  correspond to the number of conserved genes in wheat/number of genes in the syntenic region from brachypodium or rice expressed as percentage. c) gene structures of met <dig> genes at chromosome  <dig>  blastn analysis was used to align met <dig> genes from hordeum vulgare , triticum urartu , aegilops tauschii  and triticum aestivum  .



in order to date the duplication event leading to group  <dig> paralogs, blastn analyses were conducted between hexaploid wheat , diploid wheat species  and barley . triticum urartu  shares the same deletion with tamet-5a <dig> while aegilops tauschii  and tamet-5d <dig> do not . it can then be suggested that 5a was already in the process of pseudogenization before polyploidization while 5d pseudogenization occurred in the course of, or after, polyploidization. consistent with this hypothesis, 5a displays a more pronounced gene structure alteration than 5d .

tamet1genes display distinctive evolution rates
we then investigated the putative functional differences between the nine tamet <dig> genes by evaluation of the evolution rate, which is a good indicator for the biological function of a given gene  <cit> . we chose the codon substitution model to estimate the rate of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitutions and computed the dn/ds ratio as evolution rate   <cit> . in this model, for genes with a significant biological function undergoing purifying selection non-synonymous mutations are expected to be kept at a low level whereas synonymous mutations accumulate randomly according to the neutral theory of evolution  <cit> .

as a first approach, pair-wise divergences were investigated between tamet <dig> genes and met <dig> genes from fully sequenced monocot species . mean values for a, b and d homoeologs were then calculated per homoeologous group of chromosomes  and are displayed in figure 3a. consistent with the neutral theory of evolution, ds rates were not significantly different between the three homoeologous groups. however significant differences were observed for dn and ω indicating a lower rate of evolution for homoeologous group  <dig> which belongs to the met-1b lineage. homoeologous group  <dig> is evolving at an intermediate evolution rate compared to group  <dig> and group  <dig> but does not display any deleterious mutations within the coding sequences . as expected for pseudogenes, higher dn and ω values were found for tamet <dig> at homoeologous group  <dig> figure  <dig> 
evolution rate analyses of
tamet1
genes. a) pair-wise comparisons. synonymous , non-synonymous  and evolution rate  are expressed in substitution/site and were performed using codeml. tamet <dig> from wheat homoeologous group  <dig>  were compared to brachypodium distachyon , sorghum bicolor , oriza sativa , zea mays , hordeum vulgare  and triticum aestivum  . mean values of ds, dn and ω  were then computed for each homoeologous group. whiskers represent the 10-90% range of mean values, boxes represent interquartile distances, the horizontal line across whiskers represents the median, and “+” the mean values. kruskal wallis non-parametric tests were applied to determine significant differences between mean values . b) paml branch model. tree topology was defined by a protein alignment using the same monocot species as in a). the two monophyletic groups met-1a and met-1b are indicated at the right. three distinct evolution rates ω <dig> , ω <dig>  and ω <dig>  are indicated as well as the two gene duplication events described in figure  <dig> .



secondly, various hypotheses concerning evolution rates were then tested and likelihood rate tests  were computed. eleven hypotheses were evaluated to test an increased evolution rate at various branch points in the phylogenetic tree . evolution rates are summarized in figure 3b. the results support the existence of three evolution rates  consistent with the two duplication events and the pair-wise analysis performed previously . after gene duplication, long-term changes were observed in our phylogenetic tree. ω <dig>  ω <dig> and ω <dig> evolution rates indicate that negative selection occurs in the met-1b lineage, which has the smallest evolution rate  suggesting its functional role in monocots. following the first duplication event, a two fold increase in evolution rate  is observed in the met-1a lineage except for barley chromosome  <dig> and wheat homoeologous group  <dig> for which a fourfold increase  is observed.

altogether, evolution rate analyses indicate that tamet <dig> homoeologous genes of group  <dig> are submitted to stronger purifying selection and are evolving at a slower rate suggesting their predominant role in dna methylation maintenance in hexaploid wheat. following the second duplication event, asymmetric acceleration of the evolution rate is observed between homoeologous group  <dig> and  <dig> leading eventually to the formation of pseudogenes within group  <dig> that accumulated deleterious mutations within their coding sequences.

expression of tamet1genes is mainly driven by homoeologous group 2
the above analysis of evolution rates suggests that homoeologous genes from group  <dig> are under purifying selection. as it is well documented that expression patterns influence non-synonymous substitution  <cit> , expression levels and profiles of the nine tamet <dig> genes were investigated using rna seq data from five different organs at three developmental stages each. expression levels of tamet <dig> homoeologous genes from group  <dig> were found to be  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than the tamet-5b <dig> and tamet group  <dig> ones. for tamet-5a <dig> and 5d <dig>  no significant expression was detected in any of the  <dig> conditions . homoeologous group  <dig> were expressed in most tissues at nearly all developmental stages, named according to the zadoks  scale  <cit> , but with highest expression levels at z <dig> in the stem and z <dig> in the spike. met <dig> expression levels in other species peak in proliferating cells such as in meristems and in reproductive organs  <cit> . in wheat we observed tamet <dig> expression at early developmental stages especially during early stem extension  when wheat is switching from the vegetative to reproductive phase. at that stage the spike tissue is proliferating requiring active replication during which dna methylation maintenance should occur. similarly, homoeologous group  <dig> were found to be expressed in almost all conditions but at a very low level compared to group  <dig> genes. a similar situation was observed in rice where osmet1a is 10– <dig> times less expressed than osmet1b
 <cit> . for homoeologous group  <dig>  only 5b is expressed at low level in grain .figure  <dig>

. a) wheat rna-seq. data are expressed in fragment reads per kilobase of exon model  for each homoeologous group. fpkm were computed according to the following formula: fpkm =  <dig> x  where c is the number of mappable reads on a feature, n is the total number of reads in the experiment and l  is the sum of exonic sequences in base pairs. genes were considered to be expressed only for fpkm values > <dig> . samples covering various tissues  and developmental stages indicated as zadoks  scales are indicated at the bottom. expression levels from tamet <dig> genes of a given homoeologous group were used to compute mean values. tamet <dig> from group  <dig> are expressed at higher levels in comparison to the other met <dig> copies and display two main peaks of expression in the stem  and spike .
b) rt-pcr gel analysis. rt-pcr with  or without  reverse transcriptase was performed for all tamet <dig> genes. control pcr reactions were performed for two constitutively expressed genes corresponding to ta <dig> and ta <dig> selected according to paolacci et al.  <dig>  c) quantitative rt pcr. reactions were performed for tamet-2a <dig>  2b <dig> and 2d <dig>  expression is relative to ta <dig>  and ta <dig> . d) schematic representation of tamet <dig> loci. position of met <dig> genes on chromosome maps of 2b, 5b and 7a . top and bottom positions on itmi reference map are indicated in cm.



rna-seq-based expression profiles were subsequently confirmed by rt-pcr. various primer pairs were designed at the 3′utr. semi-quantitative and quantitative analyses confirmed the expression of tamet <dig> from homoeologous group  <dig>  but transcripts were hardly or not detectable for group  <dig> and  <dig> . expression levels for 2a, 2b and 2d homoeologs were investigated by rt-qpcr but did not show strong differences, although 2b was found to be slightly more expressed . thus tamet-2a <dig>  2b <dig> and 2d <dig> are expressed in an additive mode.

recent analyses at the whole genome level indicated that housekeeping genes in wheat are enriched at pericentric positions while genes expressed with tissue-specific patterns and pseudogenes are usually found at more sub-telomeric positions  <cit> . to check whether there is a correlation between the observed gene expression differences and the physical position of tamet <dig> copies on the chromosomes, we genetically mapped tamet <dig> loci using  <dig> snps identified in the course of our sequence capture experiments . out of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> produced high quality results that led to the genetic mapping of five out of nine tamet <dig> genes, namely tamet-2b <dig>  5a <dig>  5b <dig>  7a <dig> and 7b <dig>  as positions of homoeologous copies were consistent for groups  <dig> and  <dig>  we extrapolated the position of all tamet <dig> genes from these five copies. homoeologous group  <dig> were found to be located in the pericentromeric regions of the short arm of chromosomes  <dig> whereas group  <dig> and  <dig> were mapped to subtelomeric positions of the long arms of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively .

thus met <dig> expression is mainly driven by homoeologous group  <dig> indicating specific mechanisms to keep a predominant expression of homoeologous group  <dig> over groups  <dig> and  <dig>  this observation resembles a phenomenon observed after meti gene duplication in arabidopsis where meti transcripts accumulate to  <dig>  fold higher levels than those of the duplicated metiia and b, while metiii is considered to be a pseudogene  <cit> . expression of a specific member of a given gene family is referred to as predominance  <cit>  or transcriptional dominance  <cit>  and in our case occurs for tamet <dig> genes at homoeologous group  <dig>  the pericentric position of group  <dig> genes is consistent with the conclusions drawn from a recent large scale analysis indicating that genes expressed in most tissues are located in more proximal position than those displaying tissue-specific expression patterns  <cit> . thus expression studies reinforce the idea that met <dig> homoeologous group  <dig> genes might provide methyltransferase activity.

cg-rich isochores appear at tamet1promoters and exhibit high dna methylation
while low, or absent expression of specific tamet <dig> genes might be explained by several factors including genetic mutations or insertion of transposable elements, epigenetic marks at promoter regions are good candidates to explain differences in gene expression  <cit> . among these, cytosine methylation that occurs in cg sequence contexts has been shown to modulate gene expression in plants  <cit> . to investigate the potential role of dna methylation in the regulation of the met <dig> genes, met <dig> coding sequences as well as putative promoters were scanned for potential methylation sites in cg, chg and chh sequence contexts.

the putative promoters of the nine genes were defined as ~2-3 kb regions upstream of the coding sequence depending upon the availability of the genomic sequences . comparisons between upstream and coding sequences for potential methylation sites in chg and chh contexts revealed similar amounts of chg and chh sites for all nine genes . in contrast, cytosines in the cg context were enriched at potential promoter regions of homoeologous group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  compared to group  <dig> putative promoters regions . this result was unexpected because cg-rich regions , although already described in arabidopsis genes, were shown to be mainly located in introns  <cit> .figure  <dig>

as cg-rich isochores at tamet <dig> upstream regions could be the result of new insertions of cg-rich dna sequences, we looked for such events. indeed, two dna insertions of  <dig> and 122 bp overlapping with cg-rich isochores were observed for the tamet-7d <dig> upstream region . both insertions were already present within the ancestral d genome  suggesting their integration prior to polyploidization . blastn analysis against the trep database indicated a short but significant homology with a stowaway miniature inverted repeat  for the 122 bp insertion while no significant homology was detected for the larger 786 bp insertion. blastn against trep performed with the five remaining upstream regions  failed to detect any transposable elements as shown in figure  <dig>  instead of a new large dna insertion enriched in cg observed at 7d, the cg-rich isochores are more dispersed along the 5a, 5b, 5d, 7a and 7b putative promoter regions . this may argue in favor of a progressive cg accumulation in the course of evolution.

to determine whether these regions enriched in cytosine residues on homoeologous group  <dig> and  <dig> are indeed methylated, we performed bisulfite sequencing. we designed bisulfite primers in a way to simultaneously amplify all three homoeologous copies that we subsequently discriminated upon sequencing. consistent with our expression studies, putative promoter regions from homoeologous groups  <dig> and  <dig> display dna methylation in cg sequence contexts. homoeologous group  <dig> also displays significant chg methylation . among all the analyzed putative promoter regions, the highest dna methylation levels overlap with the 786 bp insertion specific to 7d .

taken together, our results suggest that the presence of cg-rich isochores in the putative promoters of group  <dig> and  <dig> tamet <dig> homoeologous genes may be due to a progressive and dispersed cg-enrichment as well as to an insertion-mediated cg-enrichment, at least for the 7d copy. in addition, the high methylation levels observed in the promoter regions of the two low-expressed homoeologous groups may suggest the existence of an autoregulatory loop controlling met <dig> gene expression.

discussion
bread wheat is a plant species with a large genome of about  <dig> gb containing up to 80% of repetitive sequences. much attention has been focused recently to understand how this genome, highly enriched in repetitive sequences, controls its transposable element fraction, which will otherwise lead to genome instability. one such mechanism is likely to involve dna methylation in the cg context, which is maintained by met <dig>  it is therefore of importance to understand how met <dig> expression is regulated in an organism with a complex hexaploid genome. in the course of our work, we observed that tamet <dig> genes contain a record of many evolutionary events, which have occurred prior and after the emergence of bread wheat.

we identified nine copies of tamet <dig> organized in three homoeologous groups at chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  at the chromosomal level, segments bearing tamet <dig> originated from two duplication events. phylogenetic and micro-synteny confirmed that chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> paralogs originated from a wgd about 50– <dig> mya in the ancestor of grass species. then the chromosome  <dig> paralog emerged from a more recent gene duplication about 13– <dig> mya in the triticea tribe. our analysis of the evolution rate revealed functional differences between the nine tamet <dig> genes. the met-1b lineage  was shown to display a lower evolution rate than the met-1a lineage . lower evolution rate is observed for genes with biological function and this is best explained by purifying selection, which counter selects deleterious mutations  <cit> . functional significance of homoeologous group  <dig> genes was reinforced by our observations of expression levels and dna methylation. low evolution rate in the met-1b lineage matches with a predominant expression of homoeologous group  <dig> over group  <dig> and  <dig>  predominant expression of one member of the met <dig> gene family was already observed in other species such as arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  suggesting that met <dig> expression level and pattern needs to be carefully controlled. interestingly, we mapped tamet <dig> homoeologous group  <dig> to peri-centric  position while group  <dig> and  <dig> were located at more sub-telomeric  regions. recent large scale analyses in wheat suggested that distal regions are more dynamic, displaying higher level of recombination and accumulate more pseudogenes and gene duplications than proximal peri-centric regions  <cit> . furthermore, genes at distal position display more tissue specific expression than those at more proximal position. it is then tempting to hypothesise that a distal chromosome position may have a direct influence on expression leading as a consequence to the predominance of the more proximal genes as observed in our case for homoeologous group  <dig>  homoeologous group  <dig> did not show any differences in gene expression among the three homoeologs. consistent with the whole genome analyses was the fact that genome-wide transcriptional dominance of an individual subgenome  was not observed  <cit> . besides its position along the chromosome, our data indicated that dna methylation observed in the promoter region of homoeologous group  <dig> and  <dig> may have contributed to their transcriptional repression and may have favored an increased evolution rate at tamet-5a <dig> and 5d <dig> leading to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, a process known as pseudogenization  <cit> . interestingly, distinctions can be made between group  <dig> homoeologs: 5a already accumulated large deletions and numerous stop codons before polyploidization, while stop codons occurred at 5d after polyploidization but are absent at 5b which however displays an elevated level of non-synonymous mutations and is expressed only in grains. pseudogenes are usually rapidly eliminated and the fact that tamet-5a <dig> and 5d <dig> pseudogenes are maintained suggests that pseudogenization may not be fully achieved or that these genes contribute in a significant but yet unknown manner to tamet <dig> activity.

our data support a functional role of dna methylation in the initiation or the maintenance of gene silencing at specific tamet <dig> genes. considering that the chromosome  <dig> paralog is the ancestral locus and shows low occurrence of potential cg methylation sites, the observed cg-rich isochores at chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> paralogs associated with dna methylation imply cg-enrichment at these putative promoter regions. cg-enrichment was unexpected as usually cg dinucleotides are under-represented due to 5-methylcytosine deamination  <cit> . at the moment we can only speculate about their possible origin. first, gc-rich and gc-poor isochores are known to occur in animals and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain their emergence  <cit> . among them the gc-biaised gene conversion  has been proposed as one of the main driving forces in the evolution of nucleotide composition. gbgc favors gc over at bases in alleles during mismatch repair following heteroduplex formation in the course of meiosis. gbgc results from base excision repair  and involves a dna glycosylase that specifically removes thymine in dna heteroduplexes. secondly, animal genomes display unmethylated cg-rich elements known as cpg islands . cgis are defined as dna sequences of a few hundred base pairs, with high cg occurrence, high g + c frequency and are involved in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . cgis have been divided into start and non-start cgis. non-start cgi are the most abundant and best explained by insertion of repeated sequences such as transposable elements  while start cgis located at the transcription start sites are only poorly explained by transposable element insertion   <cit> . interestingly, suzuki et al.,  <cit>  also proposed gbgc as one of the possible mechanisms to explain the emergence of start cgis. recently, it was suggested that gbgc occurs in plants  <cit> . gbgc can be considered as one of the possible mechanisms explaining the emergence of cg-rich isochores at tamet <dig> putative promoter regions. indeed, it may be an attractive mechanism to explain the progressive cg enrichment we observed at tamet <dig> upstream regions especially at homoeologous group  <dig> and  <dig> located at distal chromosome positions where higher recombination rates have been reported  <cit> . furthermore, the met-7d <dig> copy would have also undergone insertion of cg-rich dna fragments in a mechanism very reminiscent to the one observed for non-start cgis, arguing for shared evolutionary mechanisms between animal and plants toward the emergence of cg-rich isochores.

once cg-rich isochores appeared, they can be methylated in order to silence gene expression. although cgis were not described in plant promoters, “dense cg methylation clusters” have been reported and are proposed to silence cryptic promoters within the coding sequence  <cit> . silencing of these cryptic promoters is established first through the rna-directed dna methylation  pathway and results in methylation at cytosine residues at cg, chg and chh sequence contexts. once methylation is set up, only methylation in the cg context, which does not rely on sirna production, can be maintained in the course of evolution leading to high methylation only in cg sequence contexts  <cit> . if such a mechanism occurred within the putative promoter region of tamet <dig> genes, it can explain how homoeologous group  <dig> became progressively repressed.

given the correlation between dna methylation in promoter regions and gene silencing  <cit> , we suggest that dna methylation may be part of a possible auto-regulatory mechanism among tamet <dig> genes. in this model, met <dig> mainly encoded by homoeologous group  <dig> regulates group  <dig> gene expression through cg dna methylation maintenance. cg methylation at homoeologous group  <dig> may be alleviated in specific organs, developmental stages or upon changing environmental conditions. however possible roles for the homoeologous group  <dig>  is challenged by recent data collected in rice indicating that the main met <dig> function is ensured by met1b and not met1a. indeed, rnai against met1a does not significantly affect plant development while a met1b null mutant is lethal  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
from our data, we propose a chronology  of the genomic events observed at tamet <dig> genes, which include wgd, gene duplication, expression predominance of homoeologous group  <dig>  cg-rich isochores emergence, dna methylation and pseudogenization. the unexpectedly rich evolution history observed at tamet <dig> makes these loci a very attractive model to study further gene evolutionary mechanisms occurring in hexaploid wheat. increased copy number finally leads to tamet <dig> silencing at homoeologous group  <dig> and  <dig> , keeping genes of group  <dig>  in an active state. we hypothesize that cg methylation was used as a mean to control gene expression in the met-1a lineage favoring low expression at homoeologous group  <dig> and pseudogenization at group  <dig>  for the latter the different evolutionary stages are still observed between homoeologs. cg methylation might be required to limit homoeologous group  <dig> transcription using cg-rich isochores, which are the target of cg dna methylation. at that point, we can only speculate about the possible involvement of methylation in limiting homoeologous group  <dig> expression in tissues or developmental stages where group  <dig> is expressed, maybe leading to tissue-specific expression patterns of group  <dig> genes and their subfunctionalization.figure  <dig>

loci in the course of evolution. scheme of the emergence of the nine tamet <dig> genes is given at the left. evolution time is given from the top to the bottom in mya. the met-1a lineage is expressed  and evolved at a low evolution rate while genes in the met-1b lineage are repressed  or evolved as pseudogenes . the hypothetic succession of genomic events occurring at or including tamet <dig> is proposed at the right.



taken together, our data suggest that dna methylation at tamet <dig> loci can act as an epigenetic determinant required to drive genome evolution.
