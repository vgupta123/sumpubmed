BACKGROUND
transposable elements  of various degrees of reiteration and conservation constitute a considerable part of wheat genomes . tes are a rapidly evolving fraction of eukaryotic genomes and the main contributors to genome plasticity and divergence  <cit> . class i tes  are the most abundant among the plant mobile elements, constituting 19% of the rice genome and at least 60% of the genome in plants with a larger genome size, such as wheat and maize  <cit> . in wheat, the majority of class i tes are ltr  retrotransposons  <cit> . the internal region of ltr retrotransposons contains gag gene, encoding a structural protein, and polyprotein  gene, encoding aspartic proteinase , reverse transcriptase , rnase h , and integrase , which are essential to the retrotransposon life cycle  <cit> . because of their copy-and-paste transposition mechanism, retrotransposons can significantly contribute to an increase in genome size and, along with polyploidy, are considered major players in genome size variation observed in flowering plants  <cit> .

genomic in situ hybridisation  provides evidence for tes involvement in the divergence between genomes. gish, a method utilising the entire genomic dna as a probe, makes it possible to distinguish an individual chromosome from a whole constituent subgenome in a hybrid or an allopolyploid genome. numerous examples of successful gish applications in the analysis of hybrid genomes have been published, including in allopolyploids, lines with foreign substituted chromosomes, and translocation lines  <cit> . it is evident that the tes distinctively proliferating in the genomes of closely related species are the main contributors to the observed differences detectable by gish.

gish identification of chromosomes in an allopolyploid genome depends on the features specific during the evolution of diploid progenitor genomes to the formation of allopolyploid genomes and further within the allopolyploid genomes. three events can be considered in the evolutionary history of hexaploid wheats. the first event led to the divergence of the diploid progenitors of the a, b and d genomes from their common ancestors more than  <dig>  million years ago . the next event was the formation of the allotetraploid wheat  less than  <dig> - <dig>  mya. hexaploid wheat  formed  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . it is considered that triticum urartu was the donor of the a genome; aegilops tauschii was donor of the d genome; and the closest known relative to the donor of the b genome is aegilops speltoides.

gish using total ae. tauschii dna as a probe has demonstrated that the chromosomes of the d genome, which was the last one to join the allopolyploid genome, are easily identifiable, and the hybridisation signal uniformly covers the entire set of d-genome chromosomes  <cit> . hybridisation of total t. urartu dna to triticum dicoccoides  metaphase chromosomes distinctly identifies all a-genome chromosomes  <cit> . all these facts suggest the presence of a- and d-genome specific retroelements. construction of bac libraries for the diploid species with aa  and dd  genomes allowed these elements to be identified. fluorescent in situ hybridisation  of bac clones made it possible to select the clones giving the strongest hybridisation signal that was uniformly distributed over all chromosomes of the a or d genomes of hexaploid wheat  <cit> . subcloning and hybridisation have demonstrated that the tes present in these bac clones may determine the observed specific patterns. it has been also shown that a-genome-specific sequences have high homology to the ltrs of the gypsy-like retrotransposons sukkula and erika from t. monococcum. the d-genome-specific sequence displays a high homology to the ltr of the gypsy-like retrotransposon romani  <cit> .

the gish pattern of the b-genome chromosomes is considerably more intricate. the total ae. speltoides dna used as a probe allowed the b-genome chromosomes to be identified in the tetraploid wheat t. dicoccoides; however, the observed hybridisation signal was discrete, i.e., it did not uniformly cover all of the chromosomes but rather was concentrated in individual regions  <cit> . such a discrete hybridisation signal suggests the presence of genome-specific tandem repeated dna sequences. it has been shown that a characteristic of the b genome is the presence of gaa satellites  <cit>  and several other tandem repeats  <cit> , which are either absent or present in a considerably smaller amount in the a- and d-genomes. a more intensive hybridisation to individual regions of b-genome chromosomes as compared with the a genome was also demonstrated for the probe for ty1-copia retroelements  <cit> . the existence of b-genome specific retrotransposons analogous in their chromosomal localisation to those detected for the a and d genomes can be only hypothesised.

another intriguing issue is the time period when tes most actively proliferated in the wheat genomes. an increase in the number of determined dna sequences from the wheat a and b genomes gave the possibility to date the insertion of tes in these two genomes. the majority of tes differential proliferation in the wheat a and b genomes  took place before the allopolyploidisation event that brought them together in t. turgidum and t. aestivum. allopolyploidisation is likely to have neither positive nor negative effects on the proliferation of retrotransposons  <cit> .

the data on tes insertions in orthologous genomic regions are not contradictory to the above results on tes proliferation in diploid progenitors that occurred before allopolyploidisation. a comparison of orthologous genomic regions demonstrates the absence of conserved tes insertions in t. urartu, ae. speltoides, and ae. tauschii, which are putative diploid donors to hexaploid wheat  <cit> . on the contrary, a comparison of orthologous regions in the diploid genomes and the corresponding subgenomes of polyploid wheat species suggests the presence of conserved tes insertions  <cit> . however, note that the intergenic space, composed mainly of tes, may be subject to an extremely high rate of tes turnover  <cit> . in particular, analysis of the intergenic space in the orthologous vrn <dig> loci of t. monococcum and the a genome of tetraploid wheat has demonstrated that 69% of this space has been replaced over the last  <dig>  million years  <cit> . all this suggests intensive processes of tes proliferation and turnover in the diploid progenitors of allopolyploid wheat.

thus, it is reasonable to expect that the b genome contains specified retrotransposons dispersed over all constituent chromosomes that proliferated as early as in the diploid progenitor of this genome.

we have previously analysed nine bac clones of t. aestivum  cv. renan and identified bac clone 2383a <dig> as hybridising to a number of chromosomes  <cit>  in a dispersed manner. in this work, we have shown a predominant localisation of bac_2383a <dig> to the b-genome chromosomes of common wheat and comprehensively analysed its sequence, which gives the background for clarifying the reasons underlying its b-genome specificity. the contribution of the ltr retrotransposon fatima, the most abundant element in this clone, to the b-genome specificity of polyploid wheat and the divergence of common wheat diploid progenitors were studied.

RESULTS
bac-fish with the chromosomes of triticum allopolyploids and their diploid relatives
bac-fish was performed with the allopolyploid wheats t. durum  and t. aestivum  as well as their diploid progenitors, including the donor of the a-genome, t. urartu, donor of the d-genome, ae. tauschii, and the putative donor of the b-genome, ae. speltoides. the chromosomal localisation of bac_2383a <dig> in the allopolyploid species was determined by simultaneous in situ hybridisation using the probe combinations psc <dig>  + bac and pas <dig> + bac. the psc <dig>  and pas <dig> are tandem repeats that are used as probes for wheat chromosome identification  <cit> . figure 1a shows the hybridisation pattern for t. aestivum  with the probes psc <dig>  and bac_2383a <dig>  the strongest hybridisation signals for bac_2383a <dig> were on the  <dig> chromosomes of the t. aestivum b-genome. analogous results were obtained for the remaining two analysed common wheat cultivars, renan and saratovskaya  <dig> . in addition, using bac_2383a <dig> as a probe, we succeeded in visualising the translocation of the 7b short-arm to the long-arm of the 4a chromosome , which took place during the evolution of emmer allopolyploid wheat  <cit> . the bac-fish experiments showed preferential bac_2383a <dig> hybridisation to the b-genome chromosomes in the tetraploid species t. durum . thus, the bac_2383a <dig> probe can efficiently identify chromosomes from the b-genome of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat.

we also showed that the three genomes of common wheat  can be identified using simultaneous in situ hybridisation with bac_2383a <dig> and labelled genomic dna of ae. tauschii. in these experiments, the b-genome intensively hybridised with bac_2383a <dig> , the d-genome intensively hybridised with ae. tauschii dna , and the a-genome displayed weak or no hybridisation with both probes . the genome of ae. speltoides is easily distinguishable by in situ hybridisation with bac_2383a <dig> in the slide containing the metaphase chromosomes of both ae. speltoides and t. urartu . more contrasting distinctions are observed when bac_2383a <dig> and ae. tauschii dna are simultaneously hybridised to the slides containing mixtures of the genomes of ae. speltoides and ae. tauschii .

analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the b-genome-specific bac clone 2383a24
to precisely determine the range of sequences that could possibly contribute to the b-genome specificity of the bac_2383a <dig> fish pattern, this bac clone was sequenced and annotated .

transposable elements constitute  <dig> % of bac_2383a <dig> , and retrotransposons  are the most abundant, constituting  <dig> % of bac_2383a <dig>  ltr retrotransposons were also nest-inserted in each other . the most abundant family in the ltr retrotransposons for this bac clone contains the gypsy-like fatima elements . bac_2383a <dig> contains three copies, namely, fatima_2383a24-1p , fatima_2383a24- <dig>  and fatima_2383a24- <dig>  which account for  <dig> % of all ltr retrotransposons in this clone.

the copy number, total sequence length, and its percent content in the complete bac_2383a <dig> sequence are shown for genes, the spelt <dig> tandem repeat, and each te class, order and superfamily.

the class ii dna transposons are represented by a single copy of the caspar_2383a24-1p element, constituting only  <dig> % of bac-2383a <dig>  note that caspar_2383a24-1p has a 95% identity over the entire sequence length to the caspar_2050o8- <dig> element, which, according to our data, is characteristic of wheat subtelomeric regions  <cit> . caspar_2383a24-1p is truncated at the 3'-end and contains the sequence that codes for transposase. the five hypothetical genes identified in bac_2383a <dig> account for  <dig> % of the entire bac sequence . two hypothetical genes  contain transferase domains , and their hypothetical protein products display an 88% identity to each other. gene 2383a <dig>  is located between the two transferase-coding genes and is very similar  to the hordeum vulgare tryptophan decarboxylase gene . the functions of the remaining two hypothetical genes, 2383a <dig>  and 2383a <dig> , have not yet been identified. however, they display significant similarity  to hypothetical rice protein and display high similarity to one another  in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences . thus, the five genes form a gene island of  <dig>  bp located  <dig>  bp from the 5'- end . the intergenic regions contain four mite insertions and a  <dig> kb region similar to t. aestivum chloroplast dna. note that the 5'-end of this gene island contains a direct duplication of genes 2383a <dig>  and 2383a <dig> , which are similar to gene os04g <dig>  located on rice chromosome  <dig>  however, the 3'-end carries an inverted duplication of genes 2383a <dig>  and 2383a <dig> , which are similar to gene os01g <dig>  localised to a distal region  on the short arm of rice chromosome  <dig> 

blast alignments of the bac_2383a <dig> sequence and the contigs containing mapped wheat ests  from graingenes database  none identified any homology to bac_2383a <dig> sequence.

bac_2383a <dig> contains an array of six tandem subtelomeric spelt <dig> repeats . they constitute  <dig> % of the clone length . the presence of the spelt <dig> tandem repeat and a caspar element homologous to caspar_2050o8- <dig> suggests the bac_2383a <dig> clone likely originated from a subtelomeric chromosomal region  <cit> .

we used insertion site-based polymorphism  for developing a bac_2383a <dig> specific te-based molecular marker  <cit> . isbp exploits knowledge of the sequence flanking a te to pcr amplify a fragment spanning the junction between the te and the flanking sequence. we selected one primer pair for the junction between the elements barbara_2383a24-1p and fatima_2383a24- <dig> . the primers barbl/barbr were used for localising bac_2383a <dig> to the chromosomes of t. aestivum cv. chinese spring. pcr analysis using nullitetrasomic lines has demonstrated that the barbl/barbr fragment with a length of  <dig> bp corresponding to bac_2383a <dig> is characteristic of the 3b chromosome . the data on the homology between the dna and amino acid sequences of 2383a <dig>  and 2383a <dig>  to the distal region of the rice 1s chromosome, which is syntenic to the short arm of wheat homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> , also confirm this localisation .

note that characteristic of bac_2383a <dig> is a higher gene density  relative to an average level of one gene per  <dig> kb, typical of wheat genome, and a lower te content  as compared with the mean te level   <cit> . analysis of the contigs along the 3b chromosome has demonstrated an increase in the gene density towards the distal chromosomal regions as well as a decrease in the te content in these regions  <cit> . the contig ctg <dig> on the distal region of the 3b short arm  <cit> , whereto according to our data bac_2383a <dig> is localized, displayed the most pronounced contrast with the average gene density values and te contents of the wheat genome.

the gypsy-like fatima retrotransposon sequences are responsible for specific hybridisation to the b-genome
to detect the specific sequences that account for the major contribution to b-genome specific hybridisation, we subcloned bac_2383a <dig>  we subsequently screened subclones that gave a strong hybridisation signal with ae. speltoides genomic dna and selected several for further characterisation. using the 435-bp subclone  as a probe for in situ hybridisation , we obtained b-genome specific signal distributions on the t. aestivum chromosomes similar to the initial bac_2383a <dig> clone . sequence analysis of subclone 2383a24/ <dig> shows that it corresponds to a region of the fatima_2383a24- <dig> coding sequence and displays 85% sequence identity to the fatima_2383a24- <dig> element; it has no matches with the fatima_2383a24-1p element.

we failed to obtain b-genome specific hybridisation with different subclones corresponding to either other tes or sequences in bac_2383a <dig>  overall, our analysis suggests that the gypsy-like ltr retrotransposon fatima_2383a24- <dig> is responsible for the b-genome specificity of bac_2383a <dig> fish.

phylogenetic analysis of the gypsy-like ltr retrotransposon fatima
we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the gypsy ltr retrotransposons fatima present in bac_2383a <dig> and available in the public databases. all of the fatima elements contained in the trep database  <cit>  fall into two groups, autonomous and nonautonomous. the "autonomous" variant presented trep <dig> by consensus nucleotide sequence and had two open reading frames corresponding to hypothetical proteins ptrep <dig>  and ptrep <dig>  the "nonautonomous" variant presented trep <dig> by consensus nucleotide sequence and had open reading frames corresponding to hypothetical proteins ptrep <dig>  and ptrep <dig> . using a blastp search  <cit>  against the pfam database  <cit> , we demonstrated that ptrep <dig> contains gag and ap domains, while ptrep <dig> consists of rt, rh, int, and ap domains and displays weak similarity to the gag domain. blastn alignments demonstrate that autonomous and nonautonomous elements have high similarity in the ltr region  and moderate similarity  in the region corresponding to the aspartic proteinase domain. sequence similarity between the remaining regions of autonomous and nonautonomous elements was undetectable. bac_2383a <dig> contains representatives of both subfamilies; fatima_2383a24-  <dig> and fatima_2383a24- <dig> belong to the autonomous elements, and fatima_2383a24-1p belongs to the nonautonomous elements. in the phylogenetic study, we analysed the autonomous and nonautonomous subfamilies separately because the internal regions of these elements are rather dissimilar in their sequences.

using the consensus sequences trep <dig>  and trep <dig>  as reference sequences, we screened the ncbi nucleotide sequence database  <cit> , including the high throughput genomic sequences division   in the case of trep <dig>  the genomic sequences belonging to t. aestivum, t. durum, t. urartu, t. monococcum, and ae. tauschii showed significant blast hits  to the reference sequences. the data on the analysed fatima elements are consolidated in additional file  <dig>  from the htg sequences, we took only those ascribed to one of the common wheat genomes or genomes of its diploid relatives.

the regions homologous to the coding reference sequences were used in clustalw multiple alignments  <cit>  . multiple alignments were constructed individually for each conserved coding domain . in total, we extracted  <dig> autonomous and  <dig> nonautonomous fatima sequences from the public databases. we attributed fatima sequences to particular genomes of allopolyploid wheat , as shown in additional file  <dig> and figure  <dig> . the insertion timing was estimated for each fatima copy containing both ltr sequences .

for autonomous fatima elements, we constructed the phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences coding for the conserved ap, rt, rh, or int domains. all of the constructed phylogenetic trees for the autonomous elements had very similar topologies. the phylogenetic tree for the rh sequences  is shown as an example. in general, three main groups form the distinct branches on the trees. we designated the most abundant group as b-genome specific  because it contains practically all of the fatima elements from the b-genome chromosomes, except a subgroup of  <dig> elements from the a-genome. the element fatima_2383a24- <dig>  containing b-genome specific clone 2383a24/ <dig>  also falls into b-group. the insertion timing range for the elements of this branch is  <dig> - <dig>  mya. the members of this group cluster separately from the elements originating from the elements of ae. tauschii . the insertion timing for the elements of the d-genome specific group was determined for annotated sequences , as this group almost exclusively contains the elements found in unannotated htg sequences. the group, referred to as a mixed group, forms a distinct cluster of the a-, b-, and d-genome specific subgroups . fatima_2383a24- <dig> is a member of the b-genome specific subgroup.

phylogenetic analysis of the nonautonomous group did not show any genome-specific clustering . the insertion timing for the nonautonomous elements varies from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya; thus, the nonautonomous elements amplified approximately at the same time as the autonomous elements .

discussion
bac_2383a <dig> probes provide a means of identifying the chromosomes of the allopolyploid wheat b-genome and ae. speltoides with various backgrounds
the genus triticum comprises diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid species with a basic chromosome number multiple of seven . one of the approaches to studying plant genomes with a common origin is in situ hybridisation using total genomic dna as a probe, or gish  <cit> . this method makes it possible to concurrently estimate the similarity of repeated sequences and chromosomal rearrangement  during evolution, detect interspecific and even intraspecific  polymorphisms, and identify foreign chromosomes and their segments in a particular genetic background. the difficulties encountered in discriminating between the genomes of allopolyploid species using gish result from the following two issues:

 "fitting" of the genomes that composed the allopolyploid nucleus during the evolution of the allopolyploid species, which involved homogenization of repeated sequences and redistribution of mobile elements, and

 the genomes of diploid progenitors for an allopolyploid species are rather close to one another, with few divergent representations of repeated sequences.

gish analysis of nicotiana allopolyploids provided direct evidence for a decrease in the divergence between the parental genomes during the evolution via exchange and homogenisation of repeats  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that gish is able to distinguish between the constituent genomes in the first generation of synthetic nicotiana allopolyploids. the parental genomes of an allopolyploid formed as long ago as  <dig>  mya are similarly easy to distinguish; however, the parental genomes in this case display numerous translocations. the efficiency of gish considerably decreases when analysing the nicotiana allopolyploids formed about  <dig> mya, thereby suggesting a considerable exchange of repeats between parental chromosome sets  <cit> .

it has been suggested that close affinities among the diploid donor species t. urartu, ae. speltoides, and ae. tauschii interfere with a gish-based discrimination between different genomes in hexaploid wheat  <cit> . our results from simultaneous in situ hybridisation of bac_2383a <dig> and ae. tauschii genomic dna to the slide containing both ae. speltoides and ae. tauschii cells demonstrate a clear discrimination between the chromosomes of these diploid species . the differences between the genomes are also detectable when hybridising bac_2383a <dig> with the metaphase chromosomes of ae. speltoides and t. urartu . similar to nicotiana allopolyploids, the efficiency of genome discrimination decreases in the cases of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, likely due to increased cross-hybridisation of the bac_2383a <dig>  repeats and ae. tauschii genomic dna with chromosomes from homoeologous genomes. the formation of emmer wheat dates back to  <dig>  mya; judging from the dating for rearrangements in nicotiana allopolyploids, this is a sufficient time period for considerable rearrangements in the te fraction between the parental chromosome sets.

simultaneous hybridisation using bac_2383a <dig>  and the probes that provide for identification of common wheat chromosomes demonstrated that bac_2383a <dig> is able to detect translocations involving the b-genome that occurred during the evolution of the allopolyploid emmer wheat .

in situ hybridisation demonstrated a dispersed localisation for the majority of bac clones on wheat chromosomes , which can be explained by the fact that bac clones contain various tes with disperse genomic localisations  <cit> . analysis of the complete bac_2383a <dig> nucleotide sequence  demonstrated that mobile elements constitute  <dig> % of the sequence, the most abundant being ltr retrotransposons . most predominant among the retrotransposons is the gypsy ltr retrotransposon family fatima, constituting up to  <dig> % of all ltr retrotransposons. the results of bac subcloning and subsequent in situ hybridisation of subclone 2383a24/ <dig>  suggest that the fatima family elements significantly contribute to the bac_2383a <dig> b-genome specific fish pattern.

several reasons can explain a genome-specific bac-fish pattern, namely,  the presence of specific te families and  differences in proliferation of the same tes in different genomes.

estimating the contribution of fatima to the divergence and differentiation of the b-genome
in assessing te contribution to the differentiation of the genomes in hexaploid wheat, it is reasonable to turn to earlier works estimating the content of repeated dna sequences and heterochromatin in wheat and their progenitors. in particular, all three genomes that form hexaploid wheat considerably differ in the content of their repeated dna fraction involved in formation of the heterochromatic chromosomal regions. c-banding demonstrates that the b-genome is the richest in heterochromatin, the a-genome is the poorest, and the d-genome occupies the intermediate position  <cit> . a high heterochromatin content in the b-genome correlates with the size of this genome, which amounts to  <dig> pg and exceeds the sizes of the diploid wheat species  <cit> . it was later demonstrated that the satellite gaa was one of the main components of the b-genome heterochromatin, and the families of tandem repeats psc <dig>  and pas <dig> were detected. notably, their localisation partially coincides with the localisation of heterochromatic blocks in common wheat  <cit> . the 120-bp tandem repeat psc <dig>  predominantly clusters on the b-genome chromosomes and individual d-genome chromosomes, whereas the pas <dig>  clusters on the d-genome chromosomes and individual a- and b-genome chromosomes. the distinct localisation of these repeats in certain chromosomal regions allows their use as probes for chromosome identification  <cit> . as has been demonstrated, the diploid progenitors of the corresponding polyploid wheat genomes also differ in the content of these repeats.

in  <dig>  flavell studied the repeated sequences of t. monococcum, ae. speltoides, and ae. tauschii and demonstrated that each species contains a certain fraction of species-specific repeats. this fraction is the largest in ae. speltoides, constituting 2% of the total genomic dna. as for the diploid with the a-genome, the content of species-specific repeats is lower than in the species that donated the b- and d-genomes. part of the ae. speltoides species-specific repeats can be explained by the presence of the high copy number subtelomeric tandem repeat family spelt <dig>  <cit> . evidently, the genome-specific variants of the psc <dig>  family can contribute to this fraction.

thus, previous results suggest that the b-genome differs from the other genomes of hexaploid wheat with a higher content of distinct tandem repeat families, some of which are b-genome specific.

tes also impact b-genome specificity. the advent of wheat bac clones and their sequencing makes it possible to consider in more detail the differentiation of the parental genomes in hexaploid wheat and the involvement of repeated dna sequences in this process, namely tes, as their most represented portion. in a recent study analysing te representation in  <dig>  mb of b genomic sequences and  <dig>  mb of a genomic sequences, we showed that tes of the gypsy superfamily have proliferated more in the b-genome, whereas those of the copia superfamily have proliferated more in the a-genome  <cit> . in addition, this comparison demonstrated that the fatima family is more abundant in the b-genome among the gypsy-like elements and that the angela family is more abundant in the a-genome among the copia-like elements  <cit> . when analysing bac_2383a <dig>  which we localised to the 3b chromosome, we also demonstrated that gypsy elements are more abundant than copia elements and that fatima constitutes  <dig> % of all gypsy elements annotated in this clone . a comparison of  <dig> mb of random bac end sequences from the b-genome with  <dig>  mb of random sequences from the d-genome of ae. tauschii demonstrated that the athila-like sabrina together with fatima elements, are the most abundant te families in the d-genome  <cit> .

a study of the distribution of gypsy-like fatima elements in the common wheat genome by in situ hybridisation with the probes 2383a24/ <dig>  and bac_2383a <dig>  has revealed a b-genome specific fish pattern . most likely, the observed hybridisation patterns of fatima elements with the common wheat chromosomes is determined by higher proliferation of fatima sequences in the b-genome and/or the presence of the b-genome specific variants of fatima sequences.

analysis of the wheat dna sequences available in databases demonstrated that fatima elements are present in all the three genomes  of common wheat. phylogenetic analysis confirms that the autonomous fatima elements fall into b-genome-, d-genome- and a-genome-specific groups and subgroups . the fatima_2383a24- <dig> element  belongs to the b-genome-specific group. fatima 2383a24- <dig> belongs to the b-genome subgroup, which together with a-genome and d-genome subgroups form a mixed group. insertion of the fatima elements that form the b-genome-, a-genome- and d-genome-specific groups and subgroups took place in the time interval  <dig> - <dig>  mya . this time corresponds to the period between formation of the diploid species and their hybridisation, which led to the wild emmer tetraploid wheat t. dicoccoides  <cit> . the insertion time of fatima_2383a24- <dig>  predominantly localised to the b-genome , is  <dig>  mya, which matches the proliferation of the b-genome-specific groups in the diploid progenitor.

therefore, b-genome specificity of the gypsy-like fatima as determined by fish is, to a great degree, explained by the appearance of a genome-specific element within this family from ae. speltoides, the diploid progenitor of the b-genome. likely, its proliferation mainly occurred in this diploid species before it entered into allopolyploidy, as suggested by both the bac fish data  and phylogenetic analysis . most likely, this scenario of emergence and proliferation of the genome-specific variants of retroelements in the diploid species is characteristic of the evolution of all three genomes in hexaploid wheat. the fact that over 80% of the tes in the a- and b-genomes proliferated before the formation of allopolyploid wheat also confirms this hypothesis  <cit> . note that the b-genome-specific elements are not only present in the ty3-gypsy fatima family. in particular, in situ hybridisation of the rt fragment from ae. speltoides ty1-copia retroelements  to the t. diccocoides chromosomes distinguished between the a- and b-genome chromosomes. the rt probe displayed the most intensive hybridisation to b-genome chromosomes  <cit> .

note also the observed decrease in the efficiency of bac fish identification of the b-genome in allopolyploid wheat  compared with the diploid progenitors. this suggests that the transpositions of the gypsy ltr retrotransposon family fatima and possibly other genome-specific tes occurred after the formation of allopolyploids.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we performed a detailed analysis of the t. aestivum clone bac-2383a <dig> and the ty3-gypsy group ltr retrotransposons fatima. bac_2383a <dig>  marked by a subtelomeric spelt <dig> repeat, was localized in a distal region on the short arm of 3b chromosome using isbp marker and the data on a synteny of wheat and rice chromosomes. interestingly, characteristic of bac_2383a <dig> is a higher gene density  and a lower te content  relative to the mean values currently determined for the wheat genome, which is in general characteristic of the distal region of the short arm of 3b chromosome  <cit> . further physical mapping and sequencing of individual wheat chromosomes will clarify whether a high gene density and a lower te content are specific features of this chromosome region only or this is also characteristic of other distal chromosome regions.

the gypsy ltr retrotransposon fatima is the most abundant in bac_2383a <dig> and, similar to the overall clone, is predominantly localized to the b-genome chromosomes of polyploid and diploid wheat species. given the data from fish and the phylogenetic analysis of the fatima elements taken from public databases, we concluded that the observed hybridisation pattern of fatima elements to the common wheat chromosomes was due to higher proliferation of fatima sequences in the b-genome and the presence of b-genome specific variants of fatima sequences. according to our estimates, proliferation of b-genome specific variants of elements took place in the time interval  <dig> - <dig>  mya, which corresponds to the time period between when the diploid b-genome progenitor species ae. speltoides formed and before the hybridisation event that led to formation of the wild emmer tetraploid wheat t. dicoccoides. most likely, this scenario of emergence and proliferation of genome-specific variants of retroelements, mainly in the diploid species, is characteristic of the evolution of all three genomes in hexaploid wheat.
