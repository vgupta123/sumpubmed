BACKGROUND
dengue is a viral disease caused by four serotypes of the flavivirus genus
 <cit>  and is prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries, ranging from southeast asia to the americas
 <cit> . over  <dig> million people are infected with dengue virus  annually in over  <dig> counties, resulting in approximately  <dig> deaths
 <cit> . in malaysia, the fatality rate of dengue infection is approximately  <dig> % based on the total number of dengue infections. the majority of deaths caused by dengue infection occur after the mild infection develops into severe haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome
 <cit> . in addition to the global health problem caused by dengue infection, it also has an economic burden. the estimated cost of dengue infection is approximately us$  <dig> million per year, which is higher than hepatitis b and japanese encephalitis in southeast asia
 <cit> .

denv is an enveloped virus with a positive stranded rna genome of approximately 11 kb in length that encodes a single polypeptide. the host cell furin and the viral ns2b-ns <dig> serine protease ns2b-ns3pro cleave the viral polyprotein at different positions to release viral structural and non-structural proteins
 <cit> . therefore, the viral ns2b-ns3pro is a potential target for the design and development of antiviral drugs
 <cit> . ns2b acts as necessary a co-factor for the optimal catalytic activity of ns3
 <cit> . ns2b-ns3pro consists of  <dig> residues from the n-terminal of the ns <dig> protein and the central  <dig> residues of the hydrophilic domain of ns2b
 <cit> .

despite the numerous studies about dengue virus, currently, no effective vaccine or antiviral therapeutics is available
 <cit> . it is difficult to develop anti-dengue treatments because of the incidence of the antibody-dependent enhancement due to the existence of four dengue serotypes, the unavailability of an actual animal model
 <cit>  and the nature of the dengue protease, a promising target for dengue inhibitor development, which possesses a flat and hydrophilic active site that decreases the possibility of finding potent inhibitors to develop as antiviral therapeutics
 <cit> . these facts accentuate the need for new approaches to develop potent anti-dengue drugs.

natural antimicrobial peptides  are produced in the majority of living organisms as protection against various pathogens, including viruses. we hypothesise that amps that possess potent antiviral activities may be considered as hits-to-leads for developing new antiviral drugs. therefore, the objective of this study was to identify and characterise the inhibitory potential of the latarcin peptide  against dengue virus replication in human cells. ltc  <dig> is one of approximately seven latarcin peptides, which are produced in the venom gland of lachesana tarabaeve, a central asian spider. recent studies showed considerable antimicrobial activities of the latarcin peptides against bacteria and yeast
 <cit> . in particular, the ltc  <dig> peptide showed moderate haemolytic activity and significant antimicrobial activity compared to the other latarcin analogues
 <cit> . however, there is a paucity of available data on the antiviral activities of ltc  <dig> peptide. this study demonstrates for the first time significant inhibition by ltc  <dig> against dengue ns2b-ns3pro and dengue virus replication in hepg <dig> cells.

methods
virus propagation in mosquito cells and titration
hepg <dig> cells with passage number less than  <dig> were maintained in dmem medium supplemented with 10% fbs and incubated at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  hepg <dig> cells were used to study the peptide cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. dengue virus serotype- <dig>  was first propagated in c6/ <dig> cells. the denv2-infected cells that showed cytopathic effects  were lysed with a freeze and thaw cycle. the culture medium was then centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 10 min to remove the cell debris, filtered , portioned into aliquots and stored at -80°c until use. the viral titre of the denv <dig> suspension was established by serial dilutions on vero cells using a plaque assay.

peptide synthesis
the ltc  <dig> peptides were manufactured chemically using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis with a symphony parallel synthesiser  as previously described
 <cit> . briefly, the aqueous phase of the peptide synthesis was lyophilised to yield the crude peptide. the identity of the crude peptide was confirmed by lc-ms, and purification of the crude peptide was performed by rp-hplc . the identity of the 98% pure purified peptide was confirmed by lc-ms . the purified peptide was then lyophilised using a savant aes  <dig> automatic environmental speedvac system. to prepare 2 mm pure peptide,  <dig>  mg lyophilised peptide was dissolve into 1 ml filtered-deionised water for use as a stock solution.

protein-protein docking
the interaction between the ltc  <dig> peptide and dengue ns2b-ns3pro was identified by protein-protein docking study. the protein data bank  files of ltc  <dig>  and ns2bns3pro  were used in rigid global docking using an available online server  as described previously
 <cit> . the results of the protein-protein docking were further analysed using discovery studio software version  <dig> .

elisa binding of ltc  <dig> to dengue ns2b-ns3pro
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  was used to examine the binding affinity of ltc  <dig> to dengue ns2b-ns3pro. increasing concentrations of purified dengue ns2b-ns3pro  in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer  were bound to black 96-well plate with transparent bottom at 4°c overnight in triplicates. the wells were blocked with pbs containing  <dig> % tween  <dig>  plus  <dig> % bsa for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with pbs-t. increasing concentrations of the ltc  <dig> peptide labeled with fitc fluorescence dye  were prepared in pbs-t plus bsa; 100 μl of each dilution of the ltc  <dig> bound to plates for 3 h on ice in dark place. after the plates were washed, the fluorescence signals of bound ltc  <dig> were detected using tecan infinite m <dig> pro fluorescence spectrophotometer .

dengue ns2b-ns <dig> protease  assay
the ns2b-ns3pro assay was performed to examine whether the ltc  <dig> peptide inhibits the denv <dig> serine protease
 <cit> . briefly, a single chain ns2b  ns3pro was produced as a recombinant protein in e. coli as previously described
 <cit> . the end point reaction mixture was performed in black 96-well plates, which contained 2 μm recombinant ns2b-ns3pro, 100 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate  and varying concentrations of the ltc  <dig> peptide  buffered at ph  <dig>  with 200 mm tris-hcl in a total volume of 200 μl. the reaction mixtures without peptide, substrate with the peptides, enzyme and different concentrations of the peptides were used as controls. thereafter, all reaction mixtures were incubated at either 37°c or 40°c for 30 min, and the substrate was added to the specific reaction mixtures and incubated at the same temperatures for an additional 30 min. measurements were performed in triplicate using a tecan infinite m <dig> pro fluorescence spectrophotometer . substrate cleavage was normalised against the buffer only  at an emission wavelength of 440 nm with excitation at 350 nm. the fluorescence values obtained with the no-inhibitor control  were set at 100%, and those in the presence of peptide were calculated as a percentage of the control using non-linear regression in graphpad prism  software. the ic <dig> was calculated from nonlinear regression fitting of the signal vs. concentration data points to the standard dose–response equation y = bottom + /)). in this equation, x is the log of the compound concentration, y is the response signal, and the bottom and top refer to the plateaus of the sigmoid response curve. all assays were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. the inhibition percentage was calculated using the following formula:

 %denv2protease activity=100-intensity of enzyme activity–intensity left after inhibitionintensity of enzyme activity× <dig> 

ltc  <dig> peptide cytotoxicity
the cytotoxicity of the ltc  <dig> peptides was evaluated by determining the maximal non-toxic dose  and the 50% cytotoxic concentration  of the cells using the non-radioactive cell proliferation assay  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the peptide concentration of 25 μm showed 80% cell viability and was considered the mntd value, assuming that approximately 80% of the cells were healthy. vero cells were seeded at 1× <dig> cells/well in triplicate under optimal conditions  in 96-well plates with blank controls  and cell controls . after an overnight incubation, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ltc  <dig> peptide  with dmem medium supplemented with 2% fbs and the cell culture was analysed after 72 h. the percentage of cell viability was calculated as follows:  <dig> -  ×  <dig>  the mntd and cc <dig> values were calculated from the dose-response curves.

real time cell proliferation assay 
this assay was performed to test the real time effects of the ltc  <dig> peptide on cell viability. cell proliferation was measured using the xcelligence real-time cellular analysis  system  as described previously
 <cit> . cell viability and growth were monitored continuously after applying increasing concentrations of the ltc  <dig> peptide . briefly, the background measurements were recorded after adding 100 μl culture medium to the wells. next, the cells were seeded at a density of 1 ×  <dig> cell/well in a 16-well plate with electrodes for 18 h to allow the cells to grow to log phase. the cells were treated with different concentrations of peptide dissolved in cell culture medium and continuously monitored for up to 100 h. the cell sensor impedance was expressed as an arbitrary unit named the cell index. the cell index was recorded every 5 minutes using a rtca analyser. to eliminate variation between the wells, the cell index values were normalised to the value at the beginning of the treatment.

treatment of denv-infected cells with the ltc  <dig> peptide
to infect the hepg <dig> cells with denv <dig>  the cells were cultured in 24-well plates  for 24 h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  the virus supernatant was added to the cells at a moi of  <dig>  followed by incubation for 1 h with gentle shaking every 15 min for optimal virus to cell contact. the cells were washed twice with fresh serum-free dmem after removal of the virus supernatant. then, fresh complete dmem containing 25 μm ltc  <dig> peptide was added to the cultures and incubated for 72 h. the hepg <dig> cells were then collected, and the virus particles and expression level of the viral ns <dig> protein were examined using immunostaining and western immunoblotting.

time-of-addition assay
this assay was performed to identify the mode of antiviral activity of the ltc  <dig> peptide against denv <dig> entry, replication and release from the infected cells. three independent experiments were performed in triplicate for pre-, simultaneous and post-infection treatments. hepg <dig> cells were grown in a 24-well tissue culture plate , incubated 24 h under optimal conditions and infected with denv <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  for pre-treatment infection, 25 μm peptide was added to the cells before virus inoculation and incubated for 24 h. after removal of the old medium containing the peptide, the denv <dig> supernatant was added, followed by incubation for 1 h with gentle shaking every 10 min for optimal virus to cell contact. the virus supernatant was removed and the cells were washed twice with fresh serum-free dmem medium to remove the residual virus. fresh complete dmem medium was added and the cultures were incubated for 72 h at 37°c, supplemented with 5% co <dig>  identical applications were performed for the simultaneous treatment, except the peptide was mixed with the virus supernatant and incubated at 37°c for 1 h, and then inoculated onto the hepg <dig> cells. the post-treatment infection was performed after inoculation of the hepg <dig> cells with denv <dig>  and complete dmem medium with the ltc  <dig> peptide was then added. the cultures including the peptide were incubated for 72 h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  and three wells of infected cells in each experiment were maintained without treatment as controls. the cell supernatants were collected and stored at -80°c for viral load determination using a plaque formation assay.

dose-response assay
this assay was performed to evaluate the 50% effective concentration  of the ltc  <dig> peptide against denv <dig>  hepg <dig> cells were grown in six-well microplates  for 24 h in quadruplicate experiments. the cell culture media were removed and the cells were washed three times with pbs. then, fresh medium containing the virus supernatant was added at moi of  <dig>  followed by incubation for 1 h with gentle shaking every 15 min. the viral residues were removed by washing with pbs, and serial dilutions of the ltc  <dig> peptide  were added. the cultures including the peptide were incubated for 72 h at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  the cell supernatants were collected and stored at -80°c for viral load determination using viral rna and were quantified using one step qreal time-pcr.

virus quantification by plaque formation assay
to determine the virus yield after treatment with different concentrations of peptide, the culture supernatants were collected and serially diluted to reduce the effects of the drug residues. a 10-fold serial dilution of medium supernatant was added to new vero cells grown in 24-well plates  and incubated for 1 hr at 37°c. the cells were then overlaid with dmem medium containing  <dig> % methylcellulose. the viral plaques were stained with crystal violet dye after a five-day incubation. the virus titres were calculated according to the following formula:

 titrepfu/ml=number of plaques×volume ofdiluted virus added to the well×dilution factor of the virus usedinfect to the well in which theplaques were enumerated. 

western blot
cells lysates were prepared for immunoblotting against dengue viral antigen using ice-cold lysis buffer. the amount of protein in the cell lysates was quantified to ensure equal loading  of the western blot gels using the 2-d quant kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and then blocked with blocking buffer. the membrane was incubated overnight with anti-denv <dig> antibody specific to the viral ns <dig> protein  and an anti-beta actin antibody . after washing three times, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse igg conjugated to horseradish peroxidase  at 1: <dig>  for two h. horseradish peroxidase substrate was added to for colour development.

indirect immunostaining
to examine the efficacy of the ltc  <dig> peptide for reducing viral particles, hepg <dig> cells were grown on cover slips in 6-well plates and infected with denv <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  the denv2-infected cells were then treated with 25 μm peptide for 24 h. the cells were washed three times with pbs to remove the peptide residues and then fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15 min at -20°c. after washing, the cells were incubated with coating buffer for 1 h at room temperature. a mouse antibody specific to the dengue envelop glycoprotein  was added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 4°c. the cells were washed three times with pbs and incubated for 30 min with an anti-mouse igg labelled with fitc fluorescent dye . to stain the cell nuclei, hoechst dye was added  for the last 15 min of the incubation.

viral rna quantification
the denv <dig> copy number was quantified in the culture supernatants using one-step quantitative real-time pcr. known copies of the viral rna were 10-fold serially diluted to generate a standard curve. the viral rna was extracted using the qiamp viral rnamini kit , and the qrt-pcr was performed using a sybr green master kit . triplicate reactions were performed for each sample, and a no template control was included as a negative control. absolute quantification was performed using an abi <dig> machine . the results were analysed using sequence detection software version  <dig>  . the percentage of viral inhibition  was calculated as follows:  <dig> –  ×  <dig> 

statistical analysis
all the assays were performed in triplicate, and the statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism version  <dig>  . p values < <dig>  were considered significant. the error bars are expressed as ± sd.

RESULTS
the inhibitory potential of the ltc  <dig> peptide against the denv <dig> protease ns2b-ns3pro
the results of the global rigid complementary docking showed that the ltc  <dig> peptide bound the dengue ns2b-ns3pro near the active site . the binding affinity depends on the hydrophobic interaction of four leucine residues and two tryptophan residues of the ltc  <dig> peptide with the other hydrophobic residues of ns2b-ns3pro . therefore, a dengue ns2b-ns3pro assay was performed to confirm the docking findings that identified the possible interaction between the ltc  <dig> peptide and the dengue ns2b-ns <dig> protease.

dengue ns2b-ns3pro was produced in e. coli as a recombinant protein, and its activity was evaluated using a fluorescent peptide substrate. after the optimisation steps, the results of this assay showed that the peptide exhibited significant dose-dependent inhibition of dengue ns2b-ns3pro . the ltc  <dig> peptide showed significant binding affinity to purifies dengue ns2b-ns3pro as evinced by elisa binding assay . the peptide showed higher inhibition of the dengue ns2b-ns3pro at a high fever-like human temperature  compared to normal physiologic human temperature . the inhibitory concentration of 50% of enzyme activity  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at 40°c compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm at 37°c .

the effect of the ltc  <dig> peptide on cell proliferation and assessment of antiviral activity
the cytotoxic effect of ltc  <dig> peptide on cell viability was measured using a non-radioactive cell proliferation assay. the cc <dig> value of the ltc  <dig> peptide obtained via the optimisation steps was estimated to be approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm as shown in figure 
3a. the ltc  <dig> peptide induces cellular changes that lead to cell apoptosis
 <cit> . this activity may decrease the formation of plaques leading to a false interpretation of antiviral activity. to clarify this issue, we examined the effects of increasing concentrations of peptide on real time cell proliferation using the real-time cellular analysis  system. the results showed that the effects of the peptide on cell proliferation were insignificant at 25 μm for 110 h because the cell index was similar to the untreated control cells. cell proliferation was significantly decreased at 50 μm after 66 h of incubation of the hepg <dig> cells with the peptide .concentrations higher than 50 μm peptide were toxic to the cells at all time-points of the rtca assay. therefore, a concentration of 25 μm was identified as the maximal non-toxic dose  of the ltc  <dig> peptide used in the following experiment to evaluate the antiviral activity of the ltc  <dig> peptide. the antiviral activity of the ltc  <dig> peptide was initially evaluated by immunostaining and western blot targeting the denv <dig> ns <dig> protein. the results showed a significant reduction of viral particles after treatment with the ltc  <dig> peptide . this result was further confirmed by western blot analysis that showed significant reduction in the expression of the viral ns <dig> protein after treatment of the infected cells with peptide. this result was normalised to beta-actin as an endogenous gene to eliminate loading errors .

determination of antiviral inhibitory dose
quantitative real-time pcr was used to determine the viral copy numbers in the infected cells after treatment with the ltc  <dig> peptide. the infected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the ltc  <dig> peptide for  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h. the ltc  <dig> peptide showed dose-dependent inhibition of denv <dig> replication in hepg <dig> cells. however, the results showed insignificant effects for the time points on peptide activity . the inhibitory effects of the ltc  <dig> peptide were dependent on increasing concentrations of the peptide at the three time points. the ltc  <dig> peptide inhibited denv <dig> replication at ec <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for 24 h,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for 48 h and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for 72 h .

the mode of inhibition
the antiviral activity of the ltc  <dig> peptide was further verified by plaque formation assay that showed different inhibitory effects of the peptide against virus entry and replication in infected cells. the ltc  <dig> peptide showed significant inhibitory effects at a pre-treatment, simultaneous and post-treatment compared to the untreated cells. however, the antiviral activity for the simultaneous and post-treatment was significantly higher than the pre-treatment . the viral load  was significantly  reduced at pre-treatment  compared to the untreated cells . in addition, a significant decrease  in viral load was observed for the simultaneous treatment  and post-treatment  as shown in figure 
5a and
5b.

discussion
we performed this study to identify and characterise the inhibitory potential of the latarcin peptide  against dengue virus propagation in human cells. the results of the protein-protein docking study showed that the ltc  <dig> peptide bound to the ns <dig> by hydrophobic residue interactions of the peptide, primarily leu  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and trp  <dig> and  <dig> that interact with the surrounding hydrophobic residues of ns <dig> . the binding of ltc  <dig> to ns <dig> may effectively inhibit binding of the substrate to the active site or decrease the contribution of the ns2b co-factor active site formation. this observations were further considered by elisa binding assay that showed significant binding affinity of ltc  <dig> peptide to dengue ns2b-ns3pro.

the result of this study was further verified using a dengue ns2b-ns3pro assay that showed significant inhibition by the ltc  <dig> peptide against dengue protease. dengue ns2b-ns3pro cleaves the viral polyprotein at the positions between the capsid, ns2a-ns2b, ns2b-ns <dig>  ns3-ns4a and ns4b-ns <dig>  which lead to the release of mature individual viral structural  and non-structural  proteins
 <cit> . therefore, inhibition of dengue ns2b-ns3pro may directly lead to inhibition of the post-translational processing of the viral polyprotein and subsequent virus replication
 <cit> .

in this study, the ltc  <dig> peptide inhibited dengue ns2b-ns3pro in the low micromolar range . we hypothesise that the activity of the dengue protease decreased at the high fever temperature  because of the instability of the structural complex. therefore, the ltc  <dig> peptide showed higher inhibition, which is an approximately one fold reduction in the ic <dig> value compared to the inhibitory potential at 37°c. the activity of the ns2b-ns3pro primarily depends on the interaction between ns <dig> with the cofactor ns2b, which stabilises the enzyme structure and contributes to the formation of the active site
 <cit> .

previous studies reported various inhibitors against dengue protease, including standard serine protease inhibitors
 <cit> , substrate based inhibitors
 <cit> , and non-substrate based inhibitors
 <cit> . for example, aprotinin, a  <dig> amino acid protein, showed the highest inhibitory effect against the dengue protease at picomolar levels compared to the other standard serine protease inhibitors
 <cit> . the peptidic α-keto amide
 <cit>  and cyclopeptide inhibitors
 <cit>  showed significant inhibition against dengue ns2b-ns3pro at micromolar dose ranges compared to the other peptidic inhibitors. in addition, the non-substrate based inhibitors, such as small molecule inhibitors, showed significant inhibitory activities at low micromolar concentrations against the flavivirus proteases
 <cit> . although several of these compounds are potent inhibitors of the dengue ns2b-ns <dig> protease, some showed poor stability in solution. furthermore, several studies did not use cell-based assays to evaluate the toxicity and antiviral efficacy of the identified compounds
 <cit> . the nature of the dengue protease, which possesses a flat and hydrophilic active site, decreases the possibility of identifying potent inhibitors to develop as antiviral therapeutics
 <cit> . based on the results of this study, we postulate that the hydrophobic residues of ltc  <dig> are important for stabilising the binding to the hydrophilic active site of the dengue protease.

in this study, the inhibitory potential of the ltc  <dig> peptide against the dengue protease was further verified using cell based assays. previously, other characteristics of the latarcin family peptides, such as anti-neoplastic cells activities
 <cit> , were examined. the latarcin peptides can alter the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane, may induce the apoptosis of mammalian cells
 <cit> . because of this, the possible effect of the ltc  <dig> peptide on cell proliferation was removed to avoid false interpretation of the antiviral activity. subsequently, the antiviral activity of the ltc  <dig> peptide was evaluated at the doses with minimal effects on cell proliferation as determined by mtt assay and real-time cellular analysis . the results of the immunostaining and western blot analyses showed that the ltc  <dig> peptide significantly reduced the viral particles and non-structural protein ns <dig> in denv-infected cells. furthermore, the results of the time-of-addition assay showed that the ltc  <dig> peptide inhibited dengue virus replication at both the simultaneous and post-treatments compared to the pre-treatment. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of the latarcin peptides depends on the helix-hinge-helix structure that is important for lysing bacterial cell membranes
 <cit> . this finding emphasised that the direct incubation of denv with the ltc  <dig> peptide during the simultaneous treatment may led to lysis of the viral particles by the peptide. the results of the post-treatment and dose-response assays showed that the viral load was significantly deceased after treatment with the ltc  <dig> peptide. based on this finding, we hypothesise that the ltc  <dig> peptide may interrupt the dengue life cycle in hepg <dig> cells during post-translational processing of the polyprotein by inhibiting the dengue serine protease. this inhibition may hinder flavivirus replication and virion assembly, as evidenced by the lack of infectious virion production in mutants carrying inactivating viral proteases
 <cit> . however, other α-helical peptides, similar to ltc  <dig>  have significant inhibitory effects against hiv- <dig> because of an actual interference with the virus assembly stage of the viral life cycle
 <cit> . therefore, other mechanisms may be responsible for the observed effects, such as the interruption of virus assembly and release from the infected cells because of ltc  <dig> interaction with other viral or host cell proteins; however, this warrants additional studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the ltc  <dig> peptide exhibited significant inhibition of the dengue protease and virus replication in hepg <dig> cells. therefore, ltc <dig> may act as a lead structure for developing therapies against denv.
