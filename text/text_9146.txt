BACKGROUND
abo is the clinically most relevant blood group system in transfusion and transplantation medicine  <cit> . using classical serological methods, donor/recipient pairs are routinely classified phenotypically into four major blood groups . additional phenotypes with weak expression patterns are recognized and have been adopted for abo subgroup classification  <cit> .

to supplement serological typing, several medium- to high-throughput molecular typing methods have been developed for the glycosyltransferase encoding abo gene on human chromosome  <dig>  these methods rely on a broad range of techniques such as restriction fragment length polymorphism , sequence-specific primer  pcr, single-strand conformation polymorphism  analysis, or dna microarray hybridization . most molecular typing methods exclusively target exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which code for the catalytic domain and comprise the majority of the coding sequence, and focus on single-nucleotide polymorphisms within these two exons.

while these methods generally suffice for clinical applications  <cit> , they do not easily scale to the requirements of routine upfront abo genotyping of large cohorts of blood donors  <cit> . moreover, the currently most commonly used molecular typing methods are restricted to detecting the specific set of alleles included in the assay. novel alleles are unlikely to be detected. to date,  <dig> abo alleles are reported in the blood group antigen gene mutation database .  <dig> alleles have been added to bgmut since the database was last described in an academic publication four years ago  <cit> . as this trend is not likely to slow down in the short term, dna sequencing of the entire exonic sequences should be employed for more accurate genotyping results. several studies have discussed the application of next generation sequencing  for abo blood group genotyping or demonstrated its potential . however, so far it has not been applied at population-scale to determine abo allele frequencies.

our lab has been applying ngs for high-throughput hla genotyping based on direct sequencing of amplicons on the illumina miseq and hiseq platforms since beginning of  <dig>  <cit> . we are providing this service to stem cell donor centers, mainly dkms german bone marrow donor center and affiliated centers, to characterize newly registered potential stem cell donors. more than  <dig>  million volunteers have been typed using our ngs approach since  <dig>  the implementation of the ngs-based workflow for hla genotyping has reduced costs by more than 50 % as compared to sanger-based genotyping. furthermore, this type of workflow allows adding additional genes of interest to the donor genotyping profile at a minimal surcharge. since donor-patient matching of the abo status simplifies transplantation-related patient treatment procedures and may even improve outcome  <cit> , we chose to extend the existing ngs-based hla genotyping workflow to additionally provide abo genotyping. currently, the major bone marrow donor registries accept abo data only at the blood group resolution level . therefore, we designed the assay to provide abo blood group resolution at minimal costs. this resulted in the selection of exons  <dig> and  <dig> for sequencing, which, based on the currently known alleles, enable unambiguous determination of the abo blood group status. meanwhile we have typed  <dig>  million samples using this approach.

here, we describe the workflow and analyze the level of resolution beyond the blood group level that may be obtained by an exon  <dig> and  <dig> restricted approach:  <dig>  % of the samples can be resolved at the abo allele or allele group level. we analyze a subset of  <dig>  samples of german descent to report abo genotype frequencies at the resolution level of allele groups. furthermore, our workflow readily identifies so far unknown alleles and we describe  <dig> unique novel abo variants in exon  <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
workflow
we describe a high-throughput workflow for abo genotyping based on direct pcr amplicon sequencing on illumina miseq or hiseq instruments as described for hla typing in lange et al.  <cit> . the main advantages of this workflow are simplicity and cost effectiveness. hundreds of samples may be pooled immediately after the pcr reaction as the samples are tagged during pcr with a molecular barcode that is read during sequencing. this approach significantly reduces costs and hands-on time for all post-pcr processing steps. in addition, since adapters are incorporated during the pcr, only four straightforward steps are required to initiate sequencing: pcr cleanup, quantification, denaturation and dilution.

amplicon length is restricted to the combined forward and reverse sequencing read length, currently  <dig>  or  <dig>  bases. we designed two assays targeting exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the abo gene . since the length of exon  <dig>  exceeds the amplicon size limit of our approach, abo assay  <dig> includes two overlapping pcr reactions to cover exon  <dig> and one pcr reaction targeting exon  <dig> . this delivers high resolution but prevents multiplexing the pcr in one reaction. abo assay  <dig> is set up as multiplex pcr reaction covering exon  <dig> and the central  <dig> bases of exon  <dig> . the multiplexed abo assay  <dig> was developed to simplify the automated hitpicking setup.fig.  <dig> primer locations for the abo gene exons  <dig> and  <dig>  primers for abo assay  <dig> are marked red. primers for abo assay  <dig> are identical to assay  <dig> in exon  <dig> and marked blue in exon 7



the workflow has been applied routinely as part of the stem cell donor typing program since april  <dig>  as of march  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  million samples have been successfully abo genotyped. abo assay  <dig> pcr is performed alongside assays for hla, rh, ccr5Δ <dig> and kir genotyping using  <dig>  or  <dig>  fluidigm access array chips or 384-well pcr plates. in addition, abo assay  <dig> is applied on 384-well pcr plates to confirm results that do not meet the internal quality criteria or failed in the first round.

in our setting sequencing yields on average more than  <dig> reads per amplicon and sample. these reads are matched to the alleles as listed in the bgmut database  <cit>  by our ngs genotyping software nextype  <cit> . in contrast to many other molecular approaches our sequencing assays are not limited to detect a subset of the more frequent alleles but may rather detect the full spectrum of frequent and rare alleles as well as so far undescribed variants. our restricted focus on exons  <dig> and  <dig>  however, limits the obtainable resolution to alleles that differ in those exons. seven alleles lacking exon  <dig> and  <dig> sequence information, four alleles lacking the major part of exon  <dig> sequence information,  <dig> alleles lacking phenotype information, and one allele of uncertain phenotype were excluded  reducing the data basis to  <dig> a,  <dig> b and  <dig> o alleles.

in contrast to sanger sequencing, ngs delivers phased information: every read carries information about the phasing between two or more heterozygous positions. however, in a short amplicon sequencing workflow, phasing information between the individual amplicons is lacking. often there is only one possibility for joining amplicons that results in valid sequence combinations of e.g. exon  <dig> and  <dig>  sometimes, however, both sequences of one exon can be joined with both sequences of the other exon. in such cases, the true sequences or alleles cannot be determined without additional information. for instance, analysis of all abo alleles and their sequences showed that samples with the genotype abo*o. <dig> /abo*b <dig> . <dig> cannot be distinguished from the genotype abo*o. <dig> /abo*ax. <dig>  due to the lack of phasing information between exons  <dig> and  <dig> . given the high abundance of the abo*o. <dig>  and abo*b <dig> . <dig> alleles and the low likelihood of a genotype combining the two rare alleles abo*o. <dig>  and abo*ax. <dig> , we decided to disregard the possibility of an abo*o. <dig> /abo*ax. <dig>  combination. likewise the genotype a <dig> .02/o. <dig>  is neglected in favor of the more likely b <dig> .01/o. <dig>  allele combination. however, those rare alleles are unquestionably identified in all other genotypes.fig.  <dig> phasing issues: due to lack of phasing information between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the genotype abo*o. <dig> /abo*b <dig> . <dig> cannot be distinguished from the genotype abo*o. <dig> /abo*ax. <dig> . for exon  <dig>  sequence  <dig> may be explained by the alleles abo*o. <dig>  or abo*o. <dig>  . the allele abo*o. <dig>  is composed of exon  <dig> sequence  <dig> and exon  <dig> sequence  <dig>  the allele abo*o. <dig>  is composed of exon  <dig> sequence  <dig> and exon  <dig> sequence  <dig>  therefore, depending on the phasing between the exonic sequences, different typing results are possible: the rare swedish a allele abo*ax. <dig>   in combination with an o allele  of unknown frequency  or the common b allele abo*b <dig> . <dig> and common o allele abo*o. <dig>  



validation
we validated our workflow by genotyping  <dig> samples with known serological blood group status. for  <dig> samples  typing failed, either because read counts in one of the amplicons were too low , or because the allele groups identified in the  <dig> amplicons did not intersect and could therefore not be resolved unambiguously .

 <dig>  of the  <dig> successfully typed samples were concordant with the serological status. for  <dig> samples  genotyping results  deviated from the serological status . independent serological testing of fresh samples confirmed the o-type status for both individuals. on the other hand, the ao genotype obtained by sequencing was confirmed by an ssp assay. these conflicting results may partly be explained by the identified alleles: abo*ax. <dig> . <dig>  is expected to give rise to a very weak a phenotype  <cit> . in accordance with that, the serum assay failed to detect anti-a <dig> antibodies at room temperature. the serological status for the other sample , however, did not show any abnormalities. the molecular genotype group includes several weak a alleles  whose presence could explain the discrepant findings. those alleles cannot be excluded by our approach as they differ from abo*a <dig>  only in intron  <dig> , in exon  <dig>  or in our primer binding site covering  <dig> positions in the 5’ region of exon  <dig> .

this demonstrates the limitations of an exon 6/ <dig> restricted genotyping assay. such a restricted assay can therefore currently not replace serological analysis. it does serve, though, as a cost effective extension that adds detailed allelic information. conceptually, an addition of the missing exons  is straightforward. within the scope of our approach, however, the abo genotypes are supposed to serve as additional selection criteria within the search for hla-matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donors. furthermore, the abo status provided by our screening approach has to be confirmed by standard methods during donor clearing before stem cell transplantation. against this background, a deviation rate of  <dig>  % from the serological status seems acceptable to us.

abo allele frequencies
the primary purpose of this project was to supplement hla genotyping with basic abo blood group information at low cost. however, the data generated lends itself to an allele-level frequency analysis. we chose to analyze a subset of  <dig>  samples from individuals of german descent processed from june  <dig> to september  <dig>  low dna concentration was identified as main source of error when working with pcr volumes in the sub-microliter range  <cit> . therefore, the data set was restricted to samples with a dna concentration of higher than 20 ng/μl in order to minimize the risk for wrong assignments which could distort the frequency calculations particularly of low frequency alleles.

as discussed above, two conceptual limitations interfere with full allele-level resolution for every sample: limited sequence coverage and missing phasing information. despite the limited sequence coverage most observed alleles can be resolved to the third field . however, three a, one b and five o genotypes include alleles spanning several subtypes  . based on the remarks on the abundance of alleles and allele groups in “the blood group antigen factsbook”  <cit>  we assume that most of those alternative alleles occur at low frequencies in the german population. however, given the large sample size, some of those alternative alleles may be present in the data set. this may result in a slight overestimation of the more abundant subgroups  and an underestimation of the less frequent subgroups .table  <dig> definition of allele groups spanning multiple abo subgroups that cannot be resolved based on exons  <dig> and  <dig> and their constituent alleles

depending on the alleles present in a particular sample, the missing phase information may create an additional level of ambiguity for genotyping. however, when analyzing a large data set retrospectively, a bayesian probabilistic framework allows to partially account for the uncertainty in the data. in short, the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the frequencies can be determined for many samples without phasing problem. based on the frequencies for problem-free samples, the frequencies for the samples with phasing problems are estimated. in addition, we obtain an estimate of the level of uncertainty for each frequency estimate.

when applied to our data set of  <dig>  genotyped samples this approach delivered frequency estimates for  <dig> alleles or allele groups  ranging from  <dig>  % to 32 %. to our knowledge this is the first estimation of allelic abo frequencies on such a large dataset.fig.  <dig> bayesian abo allele and allele group frequency estimates for  <dig>  german samples. error bars denote standard deviations around the posterior mean based on  <dig>  mcmc iterations. blood group phenotypes are color-coded in blue , red  and purple . the constituent alleles combined under allele group identifiers are provided in table  <dig>  allele group identifiers ending with an asterisk combine alleles across subgroups

high-resolution genotyping
we further explored the possibilities for high-resolution genotyping based on exon  <dig> and  <dig> sequencing. while an algorithm as discussed in the previous paragraph is limited to retrospective frequency estimations, these estimates may help distinguishing between alternative allele combinations based on their relative likelihood. given sufficient difference, the less likely allele combination may be ignored accepting a minor increase in the error rate. in cases of allele combinations with similar likelihood both allele combinations should be included in the genotype result reducing the resolution.

we analyzed all observed genotyping results with unresolved phasing with regard to their frequencies and the relative likelihoods of their allele combinations . we identified  <dig> unique cases with diverse properties in our data set. the  <dig> least abundant cases have a cumulative frequency of  <dig>  % and will affect only very few samples. the six most abundant cases sum up to a cumulative frequency of 32 %, demonstrating the prevalence of the issue. likewise the relative likelihoods of two possible allele combinations range from close to  <dig> to several millions. two cases  as discussed above would lead to a different abo genotype . disregarding the oax/oa <dig> combination seems warranted without an inadequate error risk at least for german samples: even though the ob1/oa <dig> ambiguity has only an odds ratio of  <dig> , given the low frequency of that ambiguity this would theoretically result in one error in  <dig> million typed samples. twelve of the remaining cases are irrelevant for determining the subgroups as the ambiguities affect only the next field . in most circumstances those differences will not be of interest. two cases remain with a frequency above  <dig>  % and an effect on subgroup results: for case  <dig> the oax combination can be safely ignored, having a relative likelihood of smaller than 1/ <dig> . case  <dig> remains unpleasant as it combines a high frequency of  <dig>  % with a moderately low relative likelihood of one in  <dig>  in most scenarios an error rate of  <dig> in  <dig>  samples  is probably acceptable. otherwise in  <dig>  % of the samples oa <dig> versus oa <dig> cannot be resolved. we conclude that the missing phasing information does not interfere with high-resolution genotyping for german samples as for  <dig>  % of the samples phasing could be resolved at least to the subgroup level if an error rate of  <dig>  %  is acceptable.table  <dig> genotypes and their corresponding frequencies where the lack of phasing information leads to alternative outcomes . the relative likelihood of a vs. b is estimated based on allele frequencies

novel alleles
an intrinsic advantage of sequencing approaches compared to other molecular methods is the ability to identify and characterize novel alleles. as of march  <dig> we have genotyped  <dig> , <dig> samples for abo. we identified  <dig>  samples  with indications for the presence of a novel allele. as the characterization of novel alleles was not the primary focus of the project, we attempted verification by replicate sequencing only for a subset of  <dig>  samples . that subset was not systematically selected over the time course of the project. it rather reflects historic changes in analysis policies and automation capacities. for  <dig> samples  the replicate sequencing confirmed the presence of a novel allele with the identical so far unreported sequence. a total of  <dig> unique novel allelic sequences were found . while  <dig> of these sequences were encountered only once, the ten most common sequences were identified in  <dig> different samples. the most abundant sequence was identified in  <dig> samples correlating to a frequency of  <dig>  % in our data set. based on the confirmation rate of  <dig>  % for the reanalyzed samples, we estimate that about  <dig>  of the  <dig>  originally flagged samples contain novel alleles. that would correlate to an overall frequency of novel alleles of  <dig>  %. to exclude the unlikely possibility of systematic errors due to the applied technology we analyzed a random selection of  <dig> samples representing  <dig> unique novel allelic sequences a third time by pacbio sequencing , an orthogonal technology with completely different error profile. all pacbio resequencing results confirmed the original findings. this study demonstrates the potential of our workflow for the detection of novel alleles. to submit the identified novel sequences to the bgmut database more work is required. in particular an approach that covers the whole gene and provides fully phased sequence information should be applied. based on our experience with the submission of fully phased hla genes we intend to embark on this task soon.

discussion
here, we propose a cost-effective workflow for high-throughput abo genotyping. despite the restricted coverage of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the approach delivers allelic or allele group level resolution for  <dig>  % of the samples. while the frequency analysis based on  <dig>  samples from individuals of german descent allowed us to propose ways to handle ambiguities originating from unresolved phasing, we lack such detailed frequency information for the alleles compromising the not resolvable allele groups  whose sequences differ only in the regions not covered by our approach. therefore we cannot judge if those alleles prevent abo subgroup-level resolution since they may appear too frequent to disregard them. this limitation is however shared with many published molecular approaches that a priori limit the data basis to the more frequent alleles that are readily distinguishable. our workflow, however, lends itself to extend the targeted region to the other exons. such an extended workflow could deliver true allelic level abo genotyping and resolve the frequencies of the less common alleles in the so far unresolved allele groups. even such an extended workflow would still be very cost-effective. main cost factors of our workflow, when applied at high throughput, are dna isolation, pcr reactions  and sequencing. costs for dna isolation and pcr reactions depend largely on the chosen reagent providers. current reagent costs for sequencing on an illumina miseq  are well below  <dig> € per  <dig>  reads which would deliver more than plenty of reads to cover the whole abo gene. this assumes, however, that abo genotyping is performed together with other targets and/or that the throughput is sufficiently high to utilize the full capacity of the instrument. in our setup, abo genotyping is performed alongside of genotyping of six hla loci, ccr5Δ <dig>  kir and the rh blood group. up to  <dig>  samples are jointly analyzed on one rapid-run flow-cell on hiseq  <dig> instruments resulting in  <dig>  reads per sample on average, at sequencing reagent costs of about  <dig> €. this underscores the cost effectiveness of the described workflow. given the low sequencing costs, applying these strategies to an extended blood group panel seems feasible. the major challenge would lie in developing highly multiplexed efficient pcr assays targeting the genes of interest.

while the workflow is slim compared to other sequencing approaches, the sequencing alone runs for two full days. taken together, genotyping results can be obtained within four days. however, in a high-throughput optimized setting the turn-around-time would probably extend to two or three weeks.

CONCLUSIONS
the application of next generation sequencing to blood group genotyping has been proposed  <cit>  and the feasibility demonstrated in proof-of-concept studies . we report the application of ngs to abo analysis and successfully genotyped more than  <dig>  million samples. despite the restricted focus on exons  <dig> and  <dig> the data enabled us to report frequency data on  <dig> distinguished alleles or allele groups. for most of the less abundant alleles this constitutes the first quantitative frequency estimation. while this approach can by no means substitute serological abo status analysis, it could serve as a cost-effective complementation to reveal the molecular abo genotype.
