BACKGROUND
the large variety of genome sizes found throughout the plant kingdom is mainly attributed to species-specific differences in ploidy and repetitive dna content  <cit> . repetitive dna can be divided into two categories: interspersed repeats, which are individual repeat units that are distributed around the genome in an apparently random fashion, and tandem repeated dna, whose repeat units are placed next to each other in an array. several previous studies have uncovered interspersed repeats, the retrotransposons, which are usually the most abundant form of repetitive dna in plants with large genomes  <cit> . the transposition mechanism of these repeats has been well characterized with respect to interspersed repeats. multigene families including ribosomal rnas  as well as noncoding sequences such as satellite dna, minisatellite sequences and microsatellite sequences are often arranged in tandem arrays  <cit> . tandemly repeated dna is primarily found at centromeres, subtelomeric regions, and heterochromatin. recently, a number of new satellite repeats have been described in higher plants using cytological techniques  <cit> .

ribosomal dna is one of the most well-characterized tandem arrays and is made up of genes that are transcribed into the components of the ribosome  <cit> . the repeated unit consists of the 18s,  <dig> s, and 25s rrna genes, external transcribed spacers, internal transcribed spacers, and an intergenic spacer . the coding regions of rdna are highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms, whereas the sequence of the noncoding igs region varies broadly between even closely-related species. this observation has been explained by the model of horizontal or concerted evolution, originally proposed by brown et al.  <cit> . the identity of coding sequences from different species can be explained to have occurred through the maintenance of sequences with strong purifying selection. however, in plants, such as legumes  <cit> , potato  <cit> , and tobacco  <cit> , highly amplified satellite repeats with sequence homologous to the igs subrepeats of rdna have been reported to exist in dispersed patterns over several chromosomes. in these genomes, the igs subrepeat-homologous satellite sequences occur in blocks independent of the rrna gene cluster  <cit> . the satellite sequences described in plants often have erratic distributions and large differences in abundance, between even closely related species  <cit> . the discovery of satellite repeats homologous to the igs of 45s rdna induced speculation that satellite repeats might be originated from 45s rdna. the mechanism of satellite repeat generation has been explained by several hypotheses.  satellite repeats could have arisen through repeated and random unequal crossing over  <cit> ,  by replication slippage and unequal crossing over with subsequent expansion  <cit> , and  by the products of rolling circle replication of extrachromosomal circular dnas that became re-inserted into the genome  <cit> . the segmental duplication of large arrays of satellite repeats has also been proposed to be the primary mechanism responsible for their amplification, contributing to the rapid reshuffling of cento satellites in rice centromere  <cit> . however, to date, there is no clear explanation on how the sequence of the rdna unit escaped from the highly efficient concerted evolutionary mechanisms that keep it so well conserved. to better understand the origins of satellite repeats, it is necessary to find and compare sequences from genomes in different stages along the path of satellite repeat generation  <cit> . here we report the discovery of a satellite repeat that is highly homologous to igs of the 18s–25s rrna genes in tomato. the comparison of sequences from several bac clones containing rdna in various stages of modification has provided a plausible explanation for how igs homologous satellite repeats were developed from the well-conserved rdna unit.

RESULTS
cytological localization of 45s rdna and igs-homologous repeats in the tomato genome
as part of the international tomato genome sequencing project, we employed fluorescence in situ hybridization  analysis for confirmation of the position of genetic marker-anchored bac clones on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . le-hba0007f <dig>  a clone anchored at genetic marker cler-1-h <dig>  produced very strong signals in the nucleolus organizing region  of chromosome  <dig> and on three other chromosomes . however, hybridization with wheat 45s rdna  produced only one signal focused on the short arm of tomato chromosome  <dig>  indicating that this is the only location of rdna repeats . when the nucleotide sequences of tomato and wheat 45s rdnas were compared, the 18s rrna genes were 96% identical, whereas the igs sequences had very low identity  <cit> . therefore, we speculated that only the short arm of chromosome  <dig> contains the canonical 45s rdna unit and that the foci on the other three chromosomes do not contain the coding sequences of 45s rdna, but some igs sequences.

in order to test our hypothesis, we performed fish analysis with a tomato-specific igs probe  made from  <dig> bp of tomato sequence amplified from the type i subfamily igs of 25-18s rdna . like the tomato 45s rdna probe and unlike the wheat 45s rdna probe, the tomato type i igs probe hybridized to loci on four chromosomes. fish analysis on extended dna fibers prepared from s. lycopersicum confirmed that there are two types of igs organization in the tomato genome . one is co-localized with the coding sequence of rrna genes and the other is linearly stretched over a  <dig> kb region that lacks rrna genes. because fish analysis had demonstrated that the hba0007f <dig> clone is derived from the same chromosomes that hybridize to the tomato 45s rdna probe, a probe was made from the partial 18s rdna fragment of hba0007f <dig> and tested in another fish experiment . this probe hybridized only to the nor on the short arm of tomato chromosome  <dig>  these data indicate that there is a single known canonical 45s rdna block and three igs homologous satellite repeats that are independent of rrna genes in the s. lycopersicum genome.

sequence analyses reveal that transition of rdna is initiated in the nor
to determine how the satellite repeats are generated from the 45s rdna array, we determined full sequences of two bac clones in distinct stage of divergence of rdna repeat: hba0007f <dig>  of which end sequence was 89% identical to tomato 45s rdna  and sle0089p <dig>  which contains two copies of canonical rdna . sequence comparison of two bac sequences revealed dynamic changes in the hba0007f <dig> sequence which consists of seven diverged truncated rdna units with similar composition but different lengths of elements. essentially every unit has 18s, 25s,  <dig> s, and igs. the modified 18s and 25s rdnas showed 92–94% and 89–91% identity to typical rdnas, respectively. annotation of the sequence revealed that there are three significant modifications of the 45s rdna in the hba0007f <dig> clone . first, the 18s rdnas were interrupted by ltr-type retrotransposons. second, the 25s rdnas were fragmented by the igs-like sequences. third, igs sequences which have  <dig> to  <dig> times longer than normal rdna unit were found between the 25-18s rdnas.

to further characterize the igs homologous repeat sequences in the tomato genome, we selected and sequenced the bac clone, sle0049a <dig> , which has expanded igs sequences at both ends, according to the results of a blast search of the bac end sequence database . the majority  of the total  <dig>  bp sequence of sle0049a <dig>  is a long igs stretch, which are 86% identical to subrepeat i. the remainder of the sequence  is partial 25s rdna and subrepeat ii of igs. the length of the repeated unit was well-conserved as 52– <dig> bp-long throughout the  <dig>  bp of continuous subrepeat type i sequence.

ltr retrotransposons inserted in the 18s rdnas were polymerized by uneven recombination
sequence comparison of hba0007f <dig> and sle0089p <dig> showed that the tomato rdna related retrotransposons  were inserted at the same location of the seven 18s rdnas in hba0007f <dig> . following the accepted system for retrotransposon nomenclature  <cit> , it was classified as a ty3-gypsy like ltr retrotransposon. trrt <dig> through trrt <dig> are orientated in the direction of rdna transcription, and trrt <dig> has the opposite orientation . to determine the reason for the opposite orientation of trrt <dig>  we analyzed the flanking sequences of each trrt . we found that each trrt has the same flanking sequences , indicating that trrtl or others were inverted by recombination after insertion rather than inserted in the opposite orientation. therefore, we assume that this inversion was mediated by rearrangement among duplicated segments.

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> ltrs belonging to the seven trrts of hba0007f <dig> demonstrated that segmental duplications were a major process for trrt amplification . the results from computing the proportion of nucleotide differences between each pair of ltr sequences showed that no ltr pair of a single ltr retrotransposon was clustered together implying that the retrotransposons were duplicated rather than re-inserted via a intermediate rna. two ltrs of trrt <dig> were the most closely clustered, whereas ltrs of trrt <dig> and  <dig> had the most diverged sequences between any two ltrs of a single ltr-retrotransposon. however, the same positions in trrt <dig> and trrt <dig>  were closely related, indicating they were the most recently duplicated by recombination. phylogenetic analysis of 18s and 25s rdnas of hba0007f <dig> with typical rrna genes shows similar results obtained in the analysis of the ltrs .

the retrotransposon encodes four proteins, retrotrans gag, reverstranscriptase, integrase core domain, chromatin organizing modifier, and has long terminal repeats  at both ends . however, trrt <dig> contains solo ltr, but does not encode the gag-pol gene, indicating that some of the sequence was lost through unequal recombination  <cit> . the retrotransposon insertions vary in length, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, and share  <dig> % sequence identity with each other. the 18s rdnas associated with the trrts have a similar degree of sequence identity to the canonical 18s rrna gene .

because all of the retrotransposons were found at the same position,  <dig> bp of the 18s rdna, with the same flanking sequences, we examined whether the trrt transposed site-specific manner. using the retrotransposon sequence as a query to search genebank , we identified two tomato bac clones, c02hba0155e <dig> and c06hba0169d <dig>  which have the same retrotransposon, but are not associated with rdna. the flanking sequences of these retrotransposons were different from those of hba0007f <dig>  fish analysis also demonstrated that the retrotransposon sequence is present on other chromosomes as various sizes of blocks supporting that the retrotransposon was not integrated in a site-specific manner .

duplication of the igs between 25-18s rdna sequences into the middle of 25s rrna
sequence comparison of hba0007f <dig> and sle0089p <dig> showed that igs-like sequences are inserted at the same position of 25s rdna, between  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp of the canonical sequence, and each interrupted copy has lost  <dig> bp of 25s rdna sequence where the igs was inserted . of seven 25s rdnas, six had igs-like sequences in the middle of the coding region doubling the number of igs in the 45s rdna unit. the remaining 25s rdna  was missing part of its 5' end.

the size and the number of deletion of each unit of 25s rdna demonstrated that the deletions were accumulated . for example, all units  of 25s rdnas in the bac clone have a deletion of 81– <dig> bp at the same position  <dig> – <dig>  bp and the deletion frequency varies from  <dig> to  <dig>  unit iv has a single  <dig> bp deletion, while unit iii has four such deletions. following the number of deletions in each unit, the order of recombination can be deduced as: iv → v → iii. these results indicate that 25s rdnas harboring igs were mainly multiplied by unequal recombination from a single variant rather than individual igss being recombined in parallel in their respective 25s rdna sequences.

the duplicated igs-like sequences in the 25s rdna commonly contain conserved sub-family repeat sequences, namely type i subrepeat, at rich regions, and type ii subrepeat . the length of igs-like sequences inserted into 25s rdnas varies from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp and primarily depends on the length of the type ii subrepeat, but not type i subrepeat. these data indicate that type i and type ii subrepeats have been differentially regulated during molecular evolution.

differential amplification between subfamily repeats in the rdna intergenic spacer
sequence comparison of hba0007f <dig> and sle0089p <dig> showed that the length of the igss of 25-18s rdnas  in hba0007f <dig> was  <dig> to  <dig> times longer than the normal igs sequences  present in tomato genome . in addition, as shown in figure  <dig>  the type ii subrepeat present at the downstream of the transcription initiation site  has been replaced by the type i subrepeat. in the amplified igs, the type i subrepeat in the upstream of the tis was 10– <dig> times longer  than conventional type i subrepeat . furthermore, another type i subrepeat found downstream of the tis was 2– <dig> times longer  than the conventional type i subrepeat . therefore, these results strongly indicated that duplication of the igs into the 25s rdna occurred before the type ii subrepeat replacement by the type i subrepeat, and also before the type i subrepeat amplification of the igs located between the 25s and 18s rdnas. even though the length of the type i subrepeat was expanded, the monomer length was well conserved as  <dig> bp.

to figure out the molecular mechanisms of the repeat proliferation, we performed phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> repeat monomers that were identified in expanded igs in the unit iv of hba0007f <dig> sequence . by analyzing the most related monomers revealed by the neighbor-joining tree obtained , we identified  <dig> pairs of monomers that are arranged in four duplicated clusters of monomers. the data obtained demonstrated that segmental duplication was occurred among the amplified type i subrepeat.

distribution of igs-homologous repeats among closely-related tomato species
we carried out fish analysis to study the organization of the 45s rdna locus and igs-homologous repeats on the eulycopersicon red fruited subgenera  <cit> , including s. lycopersicum, s. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme, and s. pimpinellifolium, which are very closely-related species . fish analysis was applied sequentially using the pta <dig> probe for the 45s rdna locus and pigs probe for the igs type i on the pachytene chromosome of s. lycopersicum, s. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and s. pimpinellifolium. when s. lycopersicum chromosomes were hybridized to pta <dig>  a single strong signal was detected on the short arm of chromosome 2; however, in s. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and s. pimpinellifolium, four signals were detected in four separated heterochromatic regions . the number of signals was in accordance with the number of signals detected with the pigs probe in s. lycopersicum. the number of foci detected on the pachytene chromosomes with the pigs probe varied, as follows: four signals in s. lycopersicum, seven signals in s. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme, and six signals in s. pimpinellifolium . all foci were located in regions of the pericentromeric heterochromatin. most of the signals corresponding to the igs repeat were stronger and more numerous than the signals from the pta <dig> probe. however, the foci detected on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> of s. lycopersicum and s. pimpinellifolium were of a similar intensity, whether detected as with pigs or pta <dig>  taken together, the numbers of the satellite repeat vary dramatically across closely-related species and they can divide into two groups, repeats with or without rdna coding sequence .

discussion
fish analysis and the sequences of three bac clones described in this study provide a good explanation on the origin and developmental procedures involved in the evolution of igs-homologous satellite repeats because they contain both the original form and early stages of the variants in a genome. they also allow us to compare transitional sequences that make it possible to compare with previously proposed models.

multiple mechanisms have been postulated to explain the development of satellite repeats, including unequal crossover, gene conversion, satellite transposition, illegitimate recombination, and segmental duplication  <cit> . however, the origin and the development of the early stages of satellite repeat have remained unclear because transition sequences have not been identified. our results showed that rdna is the origin of the satellite repeat, and repeated rearrangement and retrotransposon insertion were involved in satellite repeat initiation . the inserted retrotransposon in 18s rdna might serve as sites of unequal or ectopic recombination  <cit> . unequal crossover seems to be commonly employed to multiply modified rdna units such as trrt inserted 18s rdnas and igs inserted 25s rdnas. doubling the number of igs into the 25s rdna seems a very effective way of amplifying a repeated sequence. duplication of igs into the 25s rdna sequence may occur prior to the amplification of the type i subrepeat of the igs of 25-18s rdna. because duplicated igs in the 25s rdna sequence is similar with normal igs in appearance feature while igss of 25-18s rdna were highly amplified and reorganized. segmental duplication of the repeat was also one of the major mechanisms of expanding satellite repeat  <cit> . the copy number of type i subrepeat in expanded igs of 25-18s rdna was also expanded by segmental duplication 

homogenization of the satellite repeat to single-type monomers seems to be actively conducted from the initial stage of the satellite repeat. gene conversion and unequal crossover has been proposed as the mechanism for genome-wide homogenization of the satellite repeats  <cit> . our results are consistent with the models in that both gene conversion and unequal crossover play a pivotal role in regional homogenization of the satellite repeats on initial step. analysis of the duplicated igs located in the 25s rdna sequence indicated that the two subrepeats are differentially regulated in their copy number. while the type i subrepeat was conserved in copy number, the number of type ii subrepeat sequence was decreased in different length between variants implying that repeated unequal crossover has occurred. neighboring sequences of type i subrepeat such as 25s rdna and the retrotransoposon may be deleted as a result of unequal crossover homogenizing the expanding repeat . however, the replacement of the type ii subrepeat to the type i subrepeat within the expanded igs of 25-18s rdna can be explained by gene conversion. despite the amplification of copy number of type i subrepeats, the size of type i subrepeat monomers was relatively well conserved as 52– <dig> bp. it appears to be a common phenomenon for the size of satellite monomers to conserve nearly uniform within a genome  <cit> , whereas the copy number of satellite monomers varies dramatically across species, within an organism, or on a specific chromosome between different subspecies or varieties  <cit> .

in addition, we have postulated that satellite repeats sharing the same monomer can become separated from the original locus. the four signals detected with the pta <dig> probe in s. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme and s. pimpinellifolium indicate that there are coding sequences of rrna at those four loci. this situation can be explained if an rdna block had moved to a new location outside of their original array, followed by coding region deletion and type i subrepeat amplification. however, it is more likely that the amplified igs repeat sequence translocated outside of the rdna array with partial coding regions attached, than that transposed sequences on multiple chromosomes independently developed satellite repeats. these assumptions are supported by our fish results in that, with the exception of foci on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  very weak or no signal was detected with a partial 18s rdna probe in s. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and s. pimpinellifolium. of course, rdna coding sequence could be effectively eliminated in the satellite repeat of s. lycopersicum. in s. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme and s. pimpinellifolium, but not yet in s. lycopersicum, additional igs-homologous satellite repeats may have been made from the original three igs homologous satellite repeats lacking rrna coding sequence.

tandem repeat segments could be moved by recombinational excision of looped-out modified rdna segments during meiotic unequal alignment of the rdna repeating units and might re-integrate into a new location  <cit> . indeed, this mechanism of recombinational deletion of amplified repeats was discovered in the fourth unit of rdna in the clone, hba0007f <dig>  of course, unequal recombination or illegitimate recombination could also lead to the translocation of satellite repeats  <cit> .

although the integration of mobile elements in rdna loci has been reported in animal taxa, new insertions are rapidly eliminated from the rdna locus by unequal crossover between sister-chromatids  <cit>  and that new insertions are subject to random crossovers. strong selective pressure against inactive rdna units eliminates these insertions from the loci  <cit> . the ltr retrotransposon in plant genome appears to have adapted differently to survive in the rdna locus. when the trrt randomly inserted into the 18s rrna gene, unequal recombination might have occurred to make the array uniform. however, instead of removing the trrt from the rdna, it increased the number of genes modified with the insert. evidence of the effort to remove the trrt is also present in the sequence: solo ltr unaccompanied by the rest of the transposon genes may be a remnant of a retrotransposon that has been removed by unequal recombination  <cit> . similar constitution of sequence containing a rdna variant and retrotransposons was found on the heterochromatin of brassica rapa.  <cit> . in addition, amplified satellite repeats with sequence homologous to the igs subrepeat of rdna have been reported in several plants  <cit> , although the preferential amplification or elimination of a repeat is highly variable across species. for example, the 2d <dig> satellite repeat found in potatoes consists of ~ <dig> kb monomers of at-rich and gc-rich subrepeat clusters, showing high sequence similarity with type i and at-rich regions of igs in rdna  <cit> . the a1/a <dig> satellite repeat of tobacco has sequence similarity to regions downstream of the tis of igs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified igs-derived satellite repeats in tomato genome. by analyses of multiple transitional sequences, we clearly showed the origin and the growing procedure of the satellite repeat in tomato genome. our results also suggested the molecular mechanisms of proliferation and homogenization of the satellite repeat in tomato genome by showing multiplication procedure of modified rdna units and amplification/deletion of different subrepeats within the 45s rdna.
