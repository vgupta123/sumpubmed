BACKGROUND
wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular inherited bacterium found in arthropods, where it manipulates host reproduction using phenotypes such as cytoplasmic incompatibility , male killing, parthenogenesis and feminization, and can spread rapidly through insect populations  <cit> . it is also an obligate mutualist of a number of filarial nematode species  <cit> .

several cases where sections of the wolbachia genome, sometimes large, have been transferred to the host chromosomes are now known in both insects and nematodes  <cit> . these are either recent events where wolbachia and host sequences are highly similar or involve extensive pseudogenization  <cit> . transcription was reported for 2% of the genes transferred to drosophila ananassae but the levels were estimated to be  <dig> to  <dig> fold lower than for a control gene, act5c  <cit> , and it has been argued that this could represent background transcriptional noise  rather than functional expression  <cit>  – translation has yet to be demonstrated. it has therefore been suggested that these fragments are on an evolutionary trajectory to degradation by neutral mutation and play no significant part in host evolution  <cit> . if so they would be analogous to the non-functional nuclear fragments of mitochondrial dna present in some animal genomes  <cit> , which are transient and in the process of decay.

the case has therefore been made that if wolbachia-insect hgt has evolutionary significance, both longevity and integration into host biology would need to be demonstrated  <cit> ; and furthermore that we would expect to see wolbachia-like genes in species that do not currently harbour wolbachia but presumably did in the past. both phylogenetic analyses and theory suggest that wolbachia can be lost over time from host species by a variety of mechanisms  <cit> . aedes aegypti, the most important mosquito vector of human dengue fever and various other arboviruses, is naturally wolbachia-uninfected but has been shown to be able to support wolbachia following artificial transinfection – with both high rates of maternal inheritance and the expression of high levels of ci  <cit> . the examination of its sequenced genome  <cit>  for any genes that could have originated in wolbachia was therefore undertaken.

RESULTS
we have discovered a case of hgt involving adjacent genes in the genomes of ae. aegypti and two wolbachia strains. the ae. aegypti gene aael <dig> shares around 50% amino acid identity with two genes in the genome of wolbachia strain wpip  <cit>  from the mosquito culex quinquefasciatus, wp <dig> and wp1346), which were probably originally a single gene split by insertion of is element wp <dig>  and also with wd <dig> in strain wmel from drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . the adjacent ae. aegypti gene aael <dig> shows partial similarity to wpip wp <dig> and to wmel wd <dig> and is inverted compared to the wolbachia genes. the intergenic region between aael <dig> and aael <dig> is around  <dig> kb . the level of sequence identity and the fact that adjacent sets of genes are involved provide a robust case for an hgt event.

rt-pcr analysis was conducted and confirmed that ae. aegypti genes aael <dig> and aael <dig> were transcribed in both male and female adult mosquitoes. the wolbachia wpip genes wp <dig> and wp <dig> were clearly amplified by rt-pcr in adult cx. quinquefasciatus of both sexes, indicating that they are also transcribed. primers aael <dig> b, c and i were designed to span three introns present in the aedes aegypti vectorbase annotation for aael004181; based on product size from rt-pcr amplification , all of these three introns proved to be mis-annotations and it was concluded that no introns are present. the apparent absence of introns, which would be particularly unusual for a mosquito gene of the size of aael <dig>  is suggestive of a bacterial origin.

full genome microarrays for aedes aegypti were hybridized to cdna from adult females, as shown in figure  <dig>  all probes with hybridization signal levels significantly above background  were ranked in order of signal intensity;  <dig> % of these probes  showed lower signal intensity than was seen for either of the two aael <dig> probes, while  <dig> % of probes significantly above background  showed lower signal intensity than was seen for either of the two aael <dig> probes. quantitative rt-pcr data for aael <dig>  aael <dig> and he act5c gene used as a control by hotopp et al.  <cit>  matched the array results, as shown in figure  <dig>  the act5c gene is, as the authors note, highly and constitutively expressed and may in fact be an overly stringent point of comparison to assess whether horizontally transferred genes are likely to be functional. in the microarray data a number of genes of known function showed very similar or lower hybridization intensities relative to the two genes of interest; for example the probes for aael <dig>  and aael <dig>  showed very similar hybridization intensities as aael <dig>  while aael <dig>  and aael <dig>  showed very similar hybridization levels as aael <dig>  based on these data it is considered likely that both aael <dig> and aael <dig> are expressed, functional genes, although obviously definitive proof of this will require the raising of antibodies followed by protein studies.

close homologs of the two ae. aegypti genes could not be found in other sequenced mosquito/insect genomes such as anopheles gambiae  <cit> . various pcr primer pairs designed for the aedes aegypti genes aael <dig> and aael <dig> failed to amplify pcr products from several other fellow subgenus stegomyia members, but did amplify products for both genes from ae. mascarensis . this species, from mauritius, is able to produce sterile offspring in laboratory crosses with ae. aegypti  <cit> . ae. mascarensis pcr products from aael <dig> primers b & f plus g & h , located in diverse regions of the gene, were sequenced and shared a mean 97% nucleotide identity over  <dig> base pairs with ae. aegypti aael <dig>  diverged homologs of the two genes may well be present in other more distant aedes species, but could not be detected here. thus, if the direction of the hgt was from wolbachia to host it would have occurred at least prior to the species divergence of ae. aegypti and ae. mascarensis and indeed the accumulation of the  <dig> kb of non-coding dna between the two genes would likely have required a considerable period of time .

the wpip genes are located at the end of a genomic prophage region, providing a putative mechanism for the hgt. wolbachia have been shown to contain phage particles by em in several studies; wo prophage have been shown to be highly variable and rapidly evolving regions in the genomes of mosquito wolbachia, and non-congruent with host phylogeny  <cit> , strongly suggesting that lateral transfer of phage between wolbachia strains has occurred. the two wmel genes wd <dig> and wd <dig> are part of an operon that also contains the ankyrin repeat domain  encoding gene wd <dig>  this operon is present in mod+ strain variants of wmel  but not in the related mod- strain wau   <cit> . the operon is located in a region of the wmel genome that was shown to be missing in wau, wd0506-wd <dig> in wmel, and in fact all these genes have homologs in the prophage regions of the wpip genome, except for the ank gene wd <dig>  therefore, although not annotated as prophage  <cit> , these genes in wmel are likely to be remnants of an old prophage region, the rest of which has been deleted or rearranged.

the ae. aegypti gene aael <dig> also shares considerably lower amino acid similarity with a group of genes in the ae. aegypti, anopheles gambiae and culex pipiens genomes. one of these ae. aegypti genes showed female salivary gland specific expression and was named aasgs <dig> . this gene and homologs in anopheles are candidate plasmodium sporozoite receptors  <cit> . it has already been suggested that the sgs-type mosquito genes might have arisen from an ancient transfer between wolbachia and mosquitoes, but with weak support  <cit> .

an alternative hypothesis is that the direction of horizontal transfer was in fact from aedes into wolbachia, and aael <dig> is part of a family of sgs-type genes that originated and evolved in mosquitoes. the acquisition of host genes by wolbachia has not previously been documented. it could be argued that this scenario is more parsimonious since only one inter-domain hgt event would be required, if a subsequent transfer from wpip  to wmel is assumed. in contrast, the hypothesis of wolbachia to aedes transfer requires a different origin of the sgs genes compared to aael <dig>  however, phylogenetic reconstruction  does not support the hypothesis of a single host-to-wolbachia hgt, since aael <dig> clusters with the wpip gene wp <dig> with a posterior probability of  <dig> and a boostrap value of  <dig>  if aael <dig> had been transferred from mosquito to wolbachia followed by subsequent transfer between wolbachia strains, the wpip and wmel sequences would be expected to be more closely related to each other than to aael <dig> and thus cluster together in the phylogenetic tree, which is not the case. thus, both phylogenetic evidence and the lack of introns support a wolbachia-to-host direction of transfer of aael <dig>  the sgs genes may also have had a bacterial origin, as suggested by their apparent lack of introns, but if this is the case then the hgt event or events responsible would be separate from that involving aael <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented provide a robust case for hgt between wolbachia and mosquitoes, and we consider wolbachia-to-host to be the most likely direction of this transfer of the genes aael004181/ <dig> in ae. aegypti and mascarensis. our results support the argument that hgt between wolbachia and their insect hosts has led to the acquisition of evolutionary innovation, provide a putative mechanism for transfer via nuclear-phage recombination, and suggest that the previously documented examples of recent/ongoing wolbachia-host hgt may have considerably more significance than interesting, but transient, phenomena.
