BACKGROUND
with the availability of high-throughput 'omics' data, more and more methods from statistics and signal processing are applied in the field of bioinformatics  <cit> . direct application of such methods to biological data sets is essentially complicated by three issues, namely  the large-dimensionality of observed variables ,  the small number of independent experiments and  the necessity to take into account prior information in the form of e.g. interaction networks or chemical reactions. while  may be tackled by targeted analysis, feature selection or efficient dimension reduction methods, the issue of low number of samples  may hinder the transfer of methods. for example, with cdna microarrays, the number of genes  is usually much larger than the experiment size n . quantitative data from experiments are often classified as 'small-n-large-p' problems  <cit>  and algorithms that are currently being developed are tailored for such kind of data. detailed prior information is in general best handled by bayesian methods  <cit> , which are however not straight-forward to formulate in small-n-large-p problems.

here, we focus on the unsupervised extraction of overlapping clusters in data sets exhibiting properties . if applied to gene expression profiles acquired by microarrays or metabolic profiles from mass spectrometry, we can interpret these clusters as jointly acting species . while partitioned clustering based on k-means  <cit>  or hierarchical clustering  <cit>  has been successful in some domains and is often the initial tool of choice for data grouping, overlapping clusters are better described by fuzzy techniques  <cit>  or linear models  <cit> . focusing on the latter, we can essentially summarize these techniques as matrix factorization algorithms. constraining the factorization using e.g. decorrelation, statistical independence or non-negativity then leads to algorithms like principal component analysis , independent component analysis  <cit>  and nonnegative matrix factorization  <cit> , respectively. although such methods are successfully applied in bioinformatics  <cit> , they partially run into issues  as described above. in particular, it is not clear how to include prior knowledge, which has been a quite successful strategy in other contexts  <cit> . a first step towards this direction is network component analysis   <cit> . it integrates prior knowledge in form of a multiple-input motif to uncover hidden regulatory signals from the outputs of networked systems, a task also covered in  <cit> . hence, it focuses on the estimation of single gene's expression profiles, not in a linear decomposition of a data set into overlapping clusters. nca poses strict assumptions on the topology of this predefined network, which makes it hardly applicable to mammalian high-throughput 'omics' data. moreover, feedbacks from the regulated species back to the regulators are treated only as 'closed-loops', without explicitly modeling the feedback structure.

to overcome these constraints, this contribution provides a novel framework for the linear decomposition of data sets into expression profiles. we present a new matrix factorization method that is computationally efficient , able to deal with the low number of experiments  and includes as much prior information as possible . in order to achieve computational efficiency coupled with robust estimation, we use delayed correlations instead of higher-order statistics. in signal processing, this strategy has been shown to be advantageous  <cit>  for two reasons: such methods use more information from the data without over-fitting it and they can be formulated as second order techniques. this is crucial for the application to microarray data, since dimensionality tends to be high in this environment.

however, delayed correlations can usually not be computed in the case of biological high-throughput experiments such as in microarray samples. while time-resolved experiments may provide correlations, the number of temporal observations is commonly too small  for the estimation of time-delayed correlations.

hence, we instead pose factorization conditions along the set of genes or other biological variables. we link these variables using prior knowledge e.g. in the form of a transcription factor or protein-protein interaction  network, metabolic pathways or via explicitly given models. using this information enables us to define a graph-decorrelation algorithm that combines prior knowledge with source-separation techniques, for illustration see figure  <dig>  in case of gene expression analysis the input of grade are the expression data and an underlying regulatory network. after applying grade, we obtain two matrices, a mixing and a source matrix. we interpret the sources as the biological processes and the mixing coefficients as their time-dependent activities. hereby, the extracted sources group the genes' expression that can be explained by the underlying regulatory network, e.g. different responses of a cell to an external stimulus.

the cytokine interleukin il- <dig> mediates the production of acute phase proteins by hepatocytes and promotes liver regeneration  <cit> . in order to unveil the multi-layered temporal gene responses in these processes, we measure gene expression in il- <dig> stimulated mouse hepatocytes by a time-course microarray experiment. applying grade with a literature based gene regulatory network, we are able to infer associated biological processes as well as the dynamic behavior of il- <dig> related gene expression. in addition, we find that the estimated factors are robust against the high number of false positives contained in large-scale biological databases.

RESULTS
the activation of gene regulatory processes upon external stimulations induces a re-arrangement of cellular gene expression patterns. matrix factorization techniques are currently explored in the analysis of such multi-layered and overlapping temporal responses. in the following, we propose an algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge as a constraint to the factorization task .

algorithm: matrix factorization incorporating prior knowledge
in signal processing, various matrix factorization techniques have been developed that employ intrinsic properties of data to decompose them into underlying sources  <cit> . these methods are based on delayed correlations that can be defined for data having a temporal or spatial structure. for instance, the time-delayed correlation matrix of a centered, wide-sense stationary multivariate random process x is defined as

  )ij:=exjt), 

where e denotes expectation. here, off-diagonal elements detect time-shifted correlations between different data dimensions. for τ =  <dig> this measure reduces to the common cross-correlation. given l features, e.g. genes, aggregated in a data matrix x, e.g. mrna expression data, the cross-correlation matrix can be easily estimated with the unbiased variance estimator:

  cx=1l−1xxt. 

however, the experimentally generated quantitative data sets we face in bioinformatics rarely imply a natural order like which allows defining a generic kind of delayed correlation. we therefore generalize this concept by introducing prior knowledge that links features  along a pre-defined underlying network. this network may be large-scale, but can be also an explicitly given small-scale process. moreover, integrated information may be of qualitative  as well as quantitative nature .

graph-delayed correlation
we encode prior knowledge in a directed, weighted graph g:= defined on vertices v∈{ <dig> …,l} corresponding to our features. the edges ℰ are weighted with weights w: ℰ → ℛ. these are collected in a weight matrix w ∈ ℛl×l, where wij specifies the weight of edge i → j. note that our weights may be negative, and g may contain self-loops. for any vertex i∈v, we denote by s := {j| ∈ ℰ} the set of successors of i, by p := {j| ∈ ℰ} its predecessors.

the graph g introduces a partial ordering on the l features. we use the weight matrix w as propagator for an activity pattern x ∈ ℛl of our features and define the g-shift xg of x as the vector with components

  xig:=∑j∈pwjixj. 

recursively, we define any positive shift xg . for negative shifts we replace predecessors p by successors s, which formally corresponds to a transposition of the weight matrix w. using the convention of trivial weights for non-existing edges of g, we can extend the above sum to all vertices. gathering available m experiments  into a data matrix x ∈ ℛm × l , we obtain the simple, convenient formulation of a g-shifted data set

  xg={xwττ≥0xττ < <dig>  

after mean removal, we may assume that each row of x is centered. then, in analogy to the unbiased estimator for cross-correlations in equation  <dig>  we define the graph-delayed -correlation

  cxg:=1l−1xgxt=1l− <dig>  

note that our definition includes the standard time-delayed correlation by shifting along the line graph  <dig> →  <dig> → ... → l -  <dig> → l.

the graph-delayed correlation is only symmetric if the used graph shows this feature which is, for instance in regulatory networks, rarely the case. for our following derivations, a symmetric generalized correlation measure however will turn out to be very convenient. in the remainder of this work, we will therefore use the symmetrized graph-delayed correlation

  c¯xg=12+cxgt). 

enforcing the symmetry property is strategy has been often applied in the case of temporally or spatially delayed correlations. it has also been demonstrated that symmetrization stabilizes the estimation of the cross-correlations from data  <cit> . moreover, it can be shown that asymptotically using either normal or symmetrized correlations end up giving the same eigenvectors  <cit> .

factorization model
the linear mixing model for the input data matrix x ∈ ℛm×l is given by

  x=as+ε. 

here, the matrix of source contributions a ∈ ℛm×n  is assumed to have full column rank. the sources s ∈ ℛn×lare uncorrelated, zero-mean stationary processes with nonsingular covariance matrix. we allow for a noise term ε ∈ ℛm×l, which is modeled by a stationary, white zero-mean process with variance σ <dig> . we assume white unperturbed data x˜:=as . in other words, we interpret each row of x as linear mixture of the n sources , weighted by mixing coefficients stored in a. without additional restrictions, this general linear blind source-separation problem is underdetermined.

here, we assume that the sources have vanishing graph-delayed cross-correlation with respect to some given graph g and all shifts τ. formally, this means that c¯sg is diagonal. we observe

  c¯xg={ac¯sgat+σ2i,τ=0ac¯sgatτ≠ <dig>  

clearly, a full identification of a and s is not possible, because equation  defines them only up to scaling and permutation of columns: multiplication of a source by a constant scalar can be compensated by dividing the corresponding row of the mixing matrix by the scalar. similarly, the factorization implies no natural order of the sources. we can take advantage of the scaling indeterminacy by requiring our sources to have unit variance, i.e. c¯sg=i with this, as we assumed white data x˜, we see that aat = i, i.e. a is orthogonal. thus, the factorization in equation  represents an eigenvalue decomposition of the symmetric matrix c¯xg. if additionally we assume that c¯sg has pairwise different eigenvalues, the spectral theorem guarantees that a - and with it s - is uniquely determined by x except for permutation. the reason why we focused on the symmetrized instead of the simple graph-delayed correlation matrix was precisely that we wanted to have a symmetric matrix, because then the eigenvalue decomposition is well defined and also simple to compute.

however, we have to be careful, because we cannot expect c¯xg to be of full rank. obviously, we require more features than obtained sources , hence in general rank = m. if g contains an adequate amount of information, rank is of order l and since l » m, rank ) is essentially determined by  m. hence, when analyzing high-throughput biological data linked by underlying large-scale networks, we can extract as many sources as observations are available.

the grade algorithm
equation  also gives an indication of how to solve the matrix factorization task in our setting. the first step consists of whitening the no-noise term x˜=as of the observed mixtures x. the whitening matrix can be easily estimated from x by diagonalization of the symmetric matrix c¯x˜g=c¯xg−σ2i, provided that the noise variance σ <dig> is known or reasonably estimated. if more signals than sources are observed, dimension reduction can be performed in this step. insignificant eigenvalues then allow estimation of the noise variance, compare  <cit> . now, we may estimate the sources by diagonalization of the single, symmetric graph-delayed correlation matrix c¯xg. altogether, we subsume this procedure as grade algorithm. in summary, the input of grade is  a expression matrix x ∈ ℛm×l containing m experiments and l genes and  a weight matrix w ∈ ℛl×l containing the prior knowledge. we obtain a mixing matrix a ∈ ℛm×n  and a source matrix s ∈ ℛn×l . in the case of gene expression data analysis the sources can be interpreted as biological processes and the mixing coefficients as their time-dependent activities. a matlab implementation is freely available at http://cmb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/grade.

including prior knowledge into the source-separation task may introduce bias in the patterns that are pre-defined and, in turn, the analysis and results obtained. it is important to note that annotation of biological knowledge is biased and under permanent change. therefore, when using gene regulatory networks as prior knowledge one has to keep in mind that this information is subject to annotation bias. thus the density of connections in certain regions of the network might be higher due to the fact that these parts are better explored. in the case of classification problem, recent studies have shown that methods can be improved in terms of classification accuracy by including prior knowledge into the classification process  <cit> . these methods benefit from the fact that genes are not treated as independent. hence, most of these methods are based on the hypothesis that genes in close proximity, which are connected to each other, should have similar expression profiles. the same assumption may be transferred to source-separation methods. applying standard methods like ica or pca, implies the assumption that all data points, i.e. in our setting the expression levels of different genes are sampled i.i.d. from an underlying probability density. this assumption is obviously not fulfilled, since the genes' expression values are the read-outs of different states of a complex dynamical system: genes obey dynamics along a transcription factor network. instead of ignoring the genes' dependencies, we here proposed to explicitly model them using prior knowledge given within a gene-regulatory network. therefore, one of the key advantages of grade is to overcome the assumption of the independencies. applying grade to time-course expression data , we will show that including prior knowledge into the source separation task leads to an improvement compared to fully-blind methods like pca. finally, we believe that with increasing quality and amount of biological knowledge, methods incorporating prior knowledge will increase in performance as well.

illustration of grade
in order to illustrate grade, we analyze two toy examples. we first focus on a bifan structure shown in figure 3a and assume to have six genes from the time-courses of expression levels depicted in figure 3b. for data generation, the system is simulated by ordinary differential equations:

  dxidt=−γixi+∑j∈pfji). 

where we model interactions by sigmoidal hill functions  <cit> . in this case, one input x <dig> is active until time-point  <dig>  when it is turned off and instead production of x <dig> is switched on. consequently, x <dig> peaks at time  <dig>  but also x <dig> shows an early activation due to low expression of its inhibitor. applying grade , we find that three sources are sufficient to explain the data . from the extracted sources and their time-courses  we see that the strongest source s <dig> represents the externally controlled inputs and the network topology: the source couples x <dig> and x <dig>  and in opposite direction x <dig> and x <dig>  therefore, grade is able to recover the two processes. source s <dig> has the lowest contribution to the total expression values and is needed for fine-tuning the combined dynamics, as we obtain an early activation of x <dig> due to low expression of its inhibitor. consequently, the source s <dig> is active at time-points  <dig> and  <dig>  i.e. immediately after the switching operations. source s <dig> again reflects the crossover inhibitions, accordingly its time-course is at. this source groups the input of the network, which could be linked e.g. to pathway stimulation. for our second example we use the funnel structure in figure 3f, where we defined the expression values for three different input conditions . eigenvalues and the factorization obtained by grade are visualized in figure 3h-j. source s <dig> again reflects the network topology, by grouping the cascade genes, while s <dig> allows the reconstruction of the last condition. as we expect, grade are able to recover the two independent inputs. applying grade to two different toy examples, we are able to show that grade is applicable both time-course as well as conditional experiments. in both cases, grade identifies the different responses and inputs of the system.

application: il- <dig> mediated responses in primary hepatocytes
in liver, the cytokine interleukin il- <dig> mediates two major responses. first, it induces hepatocytes to produce acute phase proteins upon infection-associated in inflammation. these proteins include complement factors to destroy or inhibit growth of microbes. in addition, il- <dig> promotes liver regeneration and protects against liver injury  <cit> . il- <dig> regulates several cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and the synthesis of acute phase proteins  <cit> . upon binding to its cell surface receptor, il- <dig> activates the receptor associated janus tyrosine kinase   <dig> - signal transducer and activator of transcription   <dig> - signal transduction pathway. the latent transcription factor stat <dig> is translocated to the nucleus after activation and subsequently alters gene expression.

to identify the biological responses to il- <dig> in a time-resolved manner, we stimulated primary mouse hepatocytes with  <dig> nm il- <dig> up to  <dig> hours and analyzed the changes in gene expression by microarray analysis. in a first approach, we extracted all genes that were significantly regulated compared to time point  <dig> h. in total, we obtained  <dig> genes and applied k-means clustering to detect groups within this set. based on this approach, we could not identify any time-resolved responses upon il- <dig> stimulation . due to the small number of significantly regulated genes, we decided to employ a genome-wide approach using grade to resolve the cellular responses upon il- <dig> in more detail.

grade discovers time-dependent biological processes upon il- <dig> stimulation
using grade, we linked all  <dig> expressed genes along a gene regulatory network derived from the transpath database . we obtained four graph-decorrelated gene expression sources , which we labeled from  <dig> to  <dig> according to their decreasing eigenvalues . we see that dimension reduction and with it noise level estimation were not possible in our case. the estimated mixing matrix is shown in figure 4a. the matrix of source contributions contains positive and negative components. we partitioned a source into submodes that contain either the negative signals or the positive signals, respectively. we selected all genes in the positive submodes by choosing a threshold ≥ <dig> as well as all genes in the negative submodes with a threshold ≤- <dig>  respectively. these sets were subsequently used for go enrichment analysis using a p-value <  <dig>  after correction by false discovery rate.

differentially expressed genes within ges  <dig> display an immediate strong increase in expression following il- <dig> stimulation. after peaking at one hour, expression decreases to elevated levels compared to untreated samples. significantly enriched go-terms within this ges correspond to responses triggered by external stimuli and in ammation . in liver, upon infection- or injury-associated in inflammation il- <dig> mediates production of acute phase proteins  by hepatocytes as represented by the go-term " in ammatory response " . angptl <dig> is a positive acute phase protein  <cit>  showing a strong increase in expression during the first hour after stimulation followed by a decrease after two hours . grade reconstruct the expression pattern by the mixing of the four different source time-patterns ges  <dig> to  <dig>  we identify angptl <dig> in ges  <dig> and  <dig> having a source contribution ≥ <dig>  the combination of both gess showing perfectly the strong increase after il- <dig>  and the induced decreased after  <dig> hours . the go-term " stimulus" includes genes of the jak-stat signaling pathway like stat <dig> as well as several genes encoding for signaling components such as hamp, cepbd and osmr. these entities represent regulatory processes like negative feedbacks as well as secondary signaling events. genes with negative contribution in ges  <dig> were associated with metabolic processes like "l-serine biosynthesis" or "fructose metabolic processes". this is in line with the function of il- <dig> as a priming factor, mediating the conversion of quiescent hepatocytes from g <dig> to g <dig> phase of the cell cycle during liver regeneration  <cit> . it can be argued that down-regulation of genes associated with metabolic processes is due to the transformation of differentiated metabolically active hepatocytes into proliferative cells. the down-regulated metabolic functions at least partially take place in mitochondria. accordingly, parts of the glycolysis pathway were down-regulated in primary hepatocytes.

summary of the main biological processes in hepatocytes regulated as response to il- <dig>  mode indicates genes with significant positive  or negative  contribution to the source. the main biological processes found for the corresponding group of genes are given in the last column.

ges  <dig> shows a slight decrease after stimulation followed by a late-phase increase in expression. we identify several biological processes associated with "cell cycle and division" within this ges. a representative gene of ges  <dig> is the cell cycle inhibitor cdkn1b. its reduction of expression corresponds to the induction of cell cycle progression and in particular to the transfer from g <dig> to g <dig>  these characteristics are further supported by the negative contribution of cdkn1b in ges  <dig>  analyzing genes with a positive contribution in ges  <dig> only, we found, in addition to involvement in early cell cycle events, genes showing an association with  cell death and apoptosis. it was already indicated that il- <dig> promotes liver regeneration and protects against liver injury by inducing anti-apoptotic and survival genes  <cit> . go-terms corresponding to genes found in ges  <dig> having a negative contribution are more heterogeneous. within the top go-terms we identified several biological functions associated with the il- <dig> stimulus. based on the induction of the acute in ammatory response, coagulation factors were activated. moreover, several genes associated with gene translation were found. in addition, genes associated with metabolic processes are represented by this ges.

the time course behavior of ges  <dig> shows a delayed activation subsequent to stimulation with il- <dig>  we identified several go-terms associated with "cell cycle" and "cell division" similar to ges  <dig>  however, ges  <dig> includes mainly genes related to late events in the cell cycle, i.e. during g <dig> and m phase . wee <dig> as a main regulator of cdc <dig> displays a negative contribution to ges  <dig>  hence indicating wee <dig> down-regulation and subsequent progression through the g2-m check point. in addition, we identify ccnb <dig> a late cell cycle genes, which repression leads to cell cycle arrest in the g <dig> phase. the time-course expression pattern, shows a strong increase after il- <dig> stimulation followed by a decrease after two hours . we identify ccnb <dig> in ges  <dig> and ges  <dig> perfectly reconstruct the strong increase after the stimulation and the inactivation after two hours. the il- <dig> -induced priming phase is characterized by the activation of the latent transcription factor stat <dig>  this immediate response induces the expression of early responsive genes like the transcription factor ap- <dig>  <cit>  subsequently inducing a secondary gene response leading to transcription of cyclins a-e, p <dig>  and the cyclin dependent kinase p34-cdc <dig>  <cit> .

applying kegg pathway enrichment, we found the cell cycle, with dna replication in particular, and p <dig> pathway enriched within this ges. interestingly, il- <dig> stimulation alone is not sufficient to efficiently induce proliferation of primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro. hence, despite the persistent re-organization of the induced gene expression profile and the induction of early cell cycle players such as cyclin a, additional stimuli may be necessary to initiate a strong proliferative response of primary mouse hepatocytes. ges  <dig> shows the lowest eigenvalue. it has a strong increase in expression following the il- <dig> stimulus. go-term enrichment reveals several biological processes found in ges  <dig> -  <dig> like coagulation, translation, acute phase, and response of the stimulus. genes having a negative contribution in ges  <dig>  indicating a decrease in expression after the stimulus, are again associated with metabolic processes. both, ges  <dig> and  <dig> imply that hepatocytes stimulated with il- <dig> show affection for division causing a down-regulation of genes associated with the metabolic processes.

validation of the time-dependent signals
in order to evaluate our findings, we compared the outcome of grade with standard methods. as there is no established matrix factorization technique that incorporates prior knowledge, we employed pca  <cit> , k-means clustering  <cit>  and funcluster  <cit> , a clustering method that incorporates gene ontology information into the clustering task.

to test the biological findings obtained by grade, we applied a similar approach as proposed by teschendor et al.  <cit> . we first asked how well biological pathways can be mapped to the inferred submodes or clusters. for grade and pca, we selected in each submode the genes having an absolute source contribution above  <dig> standard-deviations. the average number of selected genes in each submode ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  for k-means clustering, we infer  <dig> clusters on a subset of the top 15% most variable genes to ensure that the average number of selected genes is comparable to grade and pca.

to evaluate the mapping of pathways to submodes or clusters we applied the pathway enrichment index . for each submode or cluster we evaluated significantly enriched pathways by using a hypergeometric test . the pei is then defined as the fraction of significant pathways mapped to at least one submode or cluster. the pei for each method is shown in figure  <dig>  we find that the pei is higher for grade compared to pca, k-means clustering or funcluster indicating that grade maps submodes closer to biological pathways.

in addition, we validated the time-dependent responses upon il- <dig> stimulation in more detail by searching for enriched go-terms. applying pca, we found that the first principle component  contains 99% of data variance . go-term enrichment analysis revealed that pc  <dig> contains genes linked to  coagulation and hemostasis . a second major response after il- <dig> is the activation of cell cycle or cell division. we found an enrichment of these biological processes in pc  <dig> and pc  <dig>  pc  <dig> shows a decreased time-course behavior after the stimulation. genes linked to cell cycle and corresponding pathways have a negative contribution in pc  <dig> indicating an increased time-course expression pattern after il- <dig> stimulation. this finding is analogous to grade, where we find cell-cycle pathways in ges  <dig> and  <dig> showing also an increasing expression pattern after the stimulation. with grade we identified several genes that are associated with metabolic processes showing a down-regulation after stimulus. pca covers these biological processes by two components pc  <dig> and pc  <dig>  where pc  <dig> shows a strong increase and pc  <dig> a decrease of expression after the stimulus . the direct response of il- <dig> was found in pc  <dig>  but we identified only acute in ammatory response. moreover, pca grouped cell cycle  and the direct response  into pc  <dig> and was not able to separate the cell cycle processes into the early  and late  responses after il- <dig> stimulation.

focusing on the results of the k-means clustering, we obtained an enrichment of cell cycle processes in cluster  <dig> . this cluster shows only a marginal increase in expression after the stimulus and therefore does not reflect the strong activation of cell cycle found by grade and pca. genes associated with metabolic processes are grouped in cluster  <dig>  which has a constant expression level after il- <dig> stimulus. hence, k-means clustering failed to infer a cluster associated to the downregulation of metabolic processes upon il- <dig>  cluster  <dig> shows a characteristic time-course pattern after il- <dig> stimulation, but we were not able to reveal any significant biological processes associated to il- <dig>  altogether, k-means clustering neither identifies the direct response upon il- <dig> nor the separation between early and late cell cycle genes. comparing the result of funcluster, we also identify a set of co-regulated genes associated with cell cycle . genes grouped in this cluster show an increase in expression after the stimulus. however, funcluster was also not able to separate the early and late cell cycle processes, observed by grade. genes associated with metabolic processes are grouped in cluster  <dig>  showing a decreasing expression pattern after one hour of stimulation. therefore, funcluster also identifies the downregulation of metabolic processes indicating that il- <dig> reduces expenditures for the energy metabolism. however, funcluster was not able to identify the primary response of il- <dig> mediating the production of acute phase proteins  by hepatocytes. moreover, funcluster also did not find any significant processes related to the jak-stat related genes, such as stat <dig>  hamp, cepbd and osmr, showing an increased expression pattern.

these results show that the decomposition obtained by grade provided much more detailed biological insights than pca, k-means clustering or funcluster. pca was able to identify three main biological processes upon il- <dig> stimulus. however, it failed to give a correct time-resolved pattern of these biological processes, whereas sources from grade reproduce the characteristic time-course behavior of the il- <dig> response. moreover, grade reveals a much more structured and time-resolved result, which allows assigning each source to a different main process.

robustness analysis
detailed knowledge about gene regulation is often not available and far from complete. therefore, the quality of a large-scale gene regulatory network is not perfect. in order to test the effect of network errors on the output of grade, we performed two robustness analyses. starting with our transpath network, we generated randomized versions by either shuffling the network content or adding random information . by shuffling edge information of the gene regulatory network between  <dig>  and 100% of all original edges, we simulated a loss of information. to quantify robustness, we employed the amari-index, which measures the deviation between two mixing matrices. we obtained significantly low amari-indices for up to 3% reshuffled edges within the gene regulatory networks , whereas a complete randomization of the network results in an amari-index of  <dig>  . this shows that the quality of the regulatory network has of course a strong influence on the output of the grade algorithm. it is obvious that grade depends on the regulatory network, and replacing gene interaction through random information will lead to loss of the signals.

we ran a second robustness analysis by adding random information to the existing gene regulatory network. this is important because we expect large-scale networks extracted from literature to contain many false-positives. significantly low amari-indices were obtained by adding up to 13% random information  to the network . this result shows that grade is able to detect the signals even after adding a large amount of probably wrong information to the network. the tolerance of the algorithm to the second randomization strategy is much higher, as here no correct information is destroyed. overall, with both randomization procedures we were able to prove that grade is robust against a reasonable amount of both, false positives and missing information.

in addition, we analyzed the noise effect of gene expression data by randomly choosing between one and three replicates for each time point. we found significantly low amari-indices  by comparing the 95% quantile of the resulting amari-index with a random sampling. thus, grade is also robust against biological noise.

CONCLUSIONS
il- <dig> promotes liver regeneration and protects against liver injury. in order to understand these effects in a time-resolved manner, we performed a time-course microarray experiment of il- <dig> stimulated primary mouse hepatocytes. standard techniques applied to this data set only partly revealed temporal gene expression patterns following the stimulation. to resolve the interaction of il- <dig> and the corresponding cellular responses in more detail, we developed grade. it extracts overlapping clusters from large-scale biological data by combining a matrix factorization approach with the integration of prior knowledge. applying grade to our experiment, we identified the activation of acute phase proteins, which are known to be one of the primary response upon infection based in ammation. moreover, we observed that il- <dig> activates cell cycle progression, as well as the down-regulation of genes associated with metabolic processes and programmed cell death. therefore, il- <dig> mediated priming renders hepatocytes more responsive towards cell proliferation and reduces expenditures for the energy metabolism.
