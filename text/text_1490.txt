BACKGROUND
the recurrent exposure of single-stranded dna  is a central aspect of cellular metabolism, permitting processes that include rna transcription and dna replication. here, localised unwinding of duplex dna is an essential initiation phase, exposing the genetic code for polymerase-mediated strand synthesis  <cit> . ssdna is also frequently exposed as a result of dna damage, both as a direct result of lesion formation, as well as subsequently during repair transactions  <cit> . in all of these processes, ssdna-binding proteins are required for proper manipulation of the dna, ensuring it is maintained in a single-stranded state, while guiding the localisation of processing enzymes  <cit> .

ssdna-binding proteins can associate with ssdna via a number of binding motifs. the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding -fold is one such motif and is characteristic of an otherwise diverse protein family  <cit> . in humans, ob-fold containing proteins have important roles in processes that include replication , dna repair , checkpoint activation , telomere maintenance  and protein translation .

human cells also encoded two additional ob-fold containing proteins, termed human single-stranded dna-binding proteins  <dig> and  <dig> . previous studies have suggested that both of these proteins function as mutually exclusive components of the sensor of single-stranded dna  complex in partnership with the integrator complex subunit  <dig>  and hssb-interacting protein  <dig>  . the depletion of any of these proteins has further been demonstrated to increase the sensitivity of cells to dna damage caused by ionising radiation exposure and treatment with the topoisomerase i inhibitor, camptothecin  <cit> . here, hssb <dig> has been reported to stimulate resection of double-strand dna break ends by the mre11-nbs1-rad <dig>   <cit>  and exo <dig>  <cit>  nucleases, as well as activation of the atm kinase  <cit> . additional roles for hssb <dig> have also been reported in the response to replication fork stalling  <cit> , as well as in oxidative stress repair  <cit> .

although hssb <dig> has largely been studied in relation to dna damage repair, a recent study has indicated that hssb <dig>  may also function in association with the integrator complex to promote mrna transcriptional termination at rna polymerase ii  pause sites  <cit> . indeed, hssb <dig> was observed to associate with rna-pol ii, as well as the transcription termination factors nelfb and spt <dig> 

in this study we sought to further determine the molecular function of hssb <dig> by identifying additional proteins with which it may associate. these findings thereby provide new insight in the composition of hssb1-containing protein complexes, which will likely be of assistance in directing future research.

RESULTS
immunoprecipitation of hssb <dig> from samples enriched for non-soluble nuclear proteins
to further elucidate the role of hssb <dig> in ssdna metabolism, we sought to identify other proteins with which hssb <dig> may associate at chromatin. to achieve this, non-soluble nuclear proteins  were firstly enriched from hela cells by sub-cellular fractionation . to assess the efficacy of this technique, the soluble and non-soluble nuclear fractions were immunoblotted with antibodies against nucleolin, a protein expected to be largely soluble under these conditions  <cit> , as well as the chromatin-associated  protein, histone h <dig> . immunoblotting for these markers demonstrated the effective relative enrichment of non-soluble nuclear proteins in our samples.fig.  <dig> immunoprecipitation of hssb <dig> from samples enriched for non-soluble nuclear proteins. a, b hela cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm kcl and nuclei collected by centrifugation. soluble-nuclear proteins were then extracted from these nuclei by incubation in a buffer containing 420 mm nacl. the remaining precipitate  was digested in a buffer containing the nuclease, benzonase. the soluble and non-soluble nuclear protein fractions  were separated by page and immunoblotted with antibodies against hssb <dig>  nucleolin  and h <dig> . c 500 μg of non-soluble nuclear protein was incubated overnight at 4 °c with protein g dynabeads bound to a hssb <dig> antibody, or a sheep isotype control igg. beads were washed five times and protein eluted by heating to 80 °c in 3× sds loading buffer for 5 min. 10% of the eluent was separated by page and stained overnight in colloidal coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig>  the red 28 kda marker indicates the migration of hssb <dig>  d the remaining eluent was resolved on a 10% acrylamide sds-page gel to a depth of 8 mm and stained overnight in colloidal coomassie brilliant blue g-250




hssb <dig> was then immunoprecipitated from these samples by overnight incubation at 4 °c with protein g dynabeads bound to hssb <dig> antibodies. to determine whether proteins had been effectively co-immunoprecipitated with hssb <dig>  10% of the eluted samples were separated by sds-page and stained with colloidal coomassie brilliant blue g- <dig> . as a number of unique bands were detected in the hssb <dig> immunoprecipitated lanes when compared to the igg lanes, this suggested the specific isolation of numerous hssb1-associating proteins. the remaining 90% of the sample was therefore briefly separated on another sds-page gel , excised and separated into  <dig> equally sized fractions, digested with trypsin and analysed by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry.

identification of hssb1-associating proteins with a range of biological functions
the mass spectrum data collected was searched against the swiss prot human database. in doing so,  <dig> unique proteins were identified from the hssb1:ip sample, compared to  <dig> immunoprecipitated with the igg isotype control. these  <dig> proteins included three keratin sub-types, two igg molecules, two histones , annexin a <dig>  gapdh and a member of the pote ankyrin domain family. the small number of proteins detected in the igg:ip sample suggests that those identified by hssb <dig> immunoprecipitation were so specifically.

interestingly, despite the major known role of hssb <dig> in the maintenance of genome stability, only a relatively small number of the hssb1-associating proteins identified are known to function in either dna repair or replication . these include the minichromosome maintenance complex subunits  <dig> and  <dig> , both of which form part of the helicase complex required for unwinding duplex dna during replication  <cit> . in addition, numerous peptides were identified belonging to dna topoisomerase ii alpha, an enzyme that alters the superhelical state of dna during both replication and mrna transcription  <cit> . a number of peptides were also detected corresponding to cul4a and ddb <dig>  which function together with other ddb1-cul4-x-box  e <dig> ubiquitin ligase components to initiate dna repair signalling following uv-induced dna damage  <cit> .fig.  <dig> identification of hssb1-associating proteins with a range of biological functions. the gel-embedded, coomassie blue-stained proteins in fig. 1d were divided into eight 1 mm gel slices, digested with trypsin and extracted. peptides were separated and detected using an agilent hplc chip qtof  <dig> system. the mass spectrum data was extracted and searched against the swiss prot human database. proteins for which corresponding peptides were identified, as well as the number of unique detected peptides, are given in additional file  <dig>  proteins were manually sorted based on their predominant known biological process as given by uniprot . proteins identified from the hssb1:ip sample are summarised as the number of unique proteins identified for each biological process

the largest group of proteins identified in our dataset contained  <dig> ribosomal proteins, belonging either to the 40s or 60s subunit. in addition,  <dig> proteins involved in ribosome biosynthesis were also detected . these proteins were likely identified due to the isolation of nucleoli following the nuclear lysis step of the subcellular fractionation, proteins of which may have been liberated during the subsequent incubation. rna metabolism proteins were also highly represented, including a number of components of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex , as well as numerous other ancillary proteins involved in polyadenylation and 3′-end cleavage of mammalian pre-mrnas. a number of proteins known to promote pre-mrna splicing were also detected and were represented by subunits and interacting partners of the u4/u6-u <dig> tri-snrnp complex, as well as other spliceosome factors. numerous atp-dependent rna helicases were also detected , many of which are of unknown physiological function, although include subunits of the exon junction complex, which marks the position of exon–exon junctions in mature mrna and promotes mrna export and translation  <cit> . components of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein  complexes were also detected which provide similar pre-mrna processing functions to those mentioned above  <cit> .table  <dig> summarising select proteins for which corresponding peptides were identified with roles in mrna processing




consistent with prior findings regarding a role for hssb <dig> in integrator-mediated transcriptional termination  <cit> , components of both the integrator and rna polymerase ii complexes were also identified , supporting such a function for hssb <dig>  as well as the validity of our dataset.table  <dig> summarising select proteins for which corresponding peptides were identified which have previously been described as associating with hssb1

to further validate the association of hssb <dig> with wich and nurd complex proteins, hssb <dig> was immunoprecipitated from hela whole cell lysates and co-eluting proteins immunoblotted with antibodies against baz1b, smarca <dig>  mta <dig> and rbbp <dig> . consistent with the mass spectrometry data, each of these proteins was specifically immunoprecipitated with hssb <dig>  these data thereby support that hssb <dig> associates with these chromatin remodelling complexes in cells.fig.  <dig> hssb <dig> associates with proteins comprising numerous chromatin-remodelling complexes. hela whole cell lysates were prepared and 500 μg incubated for 2 h at 4 °c with protein g dynabeads bound to a hssb <dig> antibody, or a sheep isotype control igg. beads were washed five times and protein eluted by heating to 80 °c in 3× sds loading buffer for 5 min. eluent was immunoblotted with antibodies against baz1b, smarca <dig>  mta <dig>  rbbp <dig> and hssb <dig> as indicated. 15 μg of whole cell lysate  was immunoblotted with antibodies against hssb <dig> and actin 




discussion
the data presented in this study suggests that while hssb <dig> has predominantly been considered in a dna repair context, it is likely to have roles in many other cellular processes. in particular, the identification of numerous proteins with roles in mrna metabolism, transcriptional transactions and ribosomal processes, may suggest these as important areas of hssb <dig> function. these findings are supportive of recent work describing a role for hssb <dig> in transcriptional termination, as well as the likely association of hssb <dig> with proteins of the integrator and rna polymerase ii complex  <cit> . consistent with the observation that hssb <dig> may be required for replication-dependent histone mrna processing  <cit> , we also identified proteins of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex , components of which have been attributed to this and other processes  <cit> . further, the identification of hssb1-associating proteins with known roles during earlier and later stages of gene expression  may suggest additional processes in which hssb <dig> could also function.

the association of hssb <dig> with a large number of ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors  may also suggest a novel role in protein translation. in this case, it is possible that membrane-bound ribosomes may have been co-isolated with other non-soluble proteins during fractionation of hela cell lysates prior to mass spectrometry analysis. as numerous nucleolar and ribosome biogenesis proteins were also identified, an alternative explanation may include the detection of hssb1-associating ribosomal proteins due to the co-isolation of nucleoli. as yet, however, the localisation of hssb <dig> to either of these structures remains untested and will require verification via alternative approaches. in addition, due to the high abundance of ribosomal components in the cell, these proteins are frequent contaminants of mass spectrometry datasets that have been generated from affinity isolated samples  <cit> . we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that although these proteins were not identified in our igg sample, their detection may be due to non-specific electrostatic interaction with hssb <dig> or other proteins. indeed, the inability to discriminate genuine interacting proteins from those that have non-specifically associated with hssb <dig> during immunoprecipitation represents a limitation of these assays. in future work, the validation of hssb <dig> associations may therefore benefit from use of additional technical approaches, such as proximity ligation assays, which do not require prior cell lysis. in addition, it will be important to establish the physiological significance of hssb <dig> in those pathways suggested in fig.  <dig>  which may reinforce the validity of our data by indirectly reflecting the associations described in this manuscript. for instance, it will be important to assess the physiological role of hssb <dig> in chromatin remodelling. this may be particularly rewarding given that chromatin-remodelling complexes have been suggested to function in replication fork integrity and dna repair , as well as have an essential role in mrna transcription  <cit> . a functional, physiological role for hssb <dig> with these proteins may therefore suggest a novel means through which hssb <dig> influences gene expression and genome stability in cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings described here provide insight into the composition of hssb1-containing protein complexes. these associations suggest functional partners through which hssb <dig> may promote genome stability maintenance and transcriptional regulation, as well as indicate other biological processes in which hssb <dig> may participate. the continued characterisation of these findings will likely yield a greater understanding of hssb <dig> molecular function.
