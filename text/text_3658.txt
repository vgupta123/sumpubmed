BACKGROUND
the hypopharyngeal gland , which is a pair of glands located in the head of worker bees, is composed of clusters of acini, which deliver secretions  into a collecting duct that runs to the mouthparts. the main function of the hg is to produce and secrete the protein components of royal jelly, which is fed to the queen and larvae. the secretory activity and function of hgs are age-dependent  <cit> . in newly emerged workers, the hgs are small and not fully developed. after that, the secretory activity of hgs could reach a peak within 6– <dig> days, and their main function at this stage is to synthesize and secrete royal jelly to feed larvae. the hgs then gradually degrade during the forager stage, and their protein secretion changes to the secretion of enzymes for brewing honey . in addition, the hg has been reported to display flexible secretory activity in response to the needs of the feeding brood  <cit> .

during the transition from newly emerged workers to foragers, the hgs show a marked change not only in size but also in protein synthesis. some proteins, including alpha-glucosidase  <cit> , amylase and glucose oxidase  <cit> , have been reported to display an age-dependent expression pattern in the hgs of workers. ohashi identified a 64-kda protein  that is expressed specifically in the hgs of nurse bees and a 56-kda protein that is expressed in the hgs of nurse bees and forager bees  <cit> . santos et al. identified the protein complement of the hgs of africanized nurse bees  and found that almost all of them were related to the mrjp family and associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates and energy  <cit> . using proteomics method, feng et al. analyzed the protein profile of six developmental stages of the apis mellifera hgs and identified many proteins, including mrjps and proteins involved in cytoskeleton, antioxidant activity, developmental regulation, and carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism  <cit> . moreover, li et al. analyzed the protein expression difference in hypopharyngeal gland development between italian and royal jelly-producing workers  through proteomics  <cit> . their results demonstrated that a high royal jelly-producing honeybee strain significantly up-regulates a large group of proteins involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides, amino acids, and fatty acids, proteins involved in protein biosynthesis, energy production, development, antioxidation, and protein folding, and transporter and cytoskeleton proteins. recently, liu et al. analyzed the gene expression difference between five developmental time points of hgs in apis mellifera and identified many degs  <cit> .

apis mellifera and apis cerana, as representative honeybee species of the east and west, are two important honeybee species that are widely bred and studied. recent studies on these two species have revealed that both geographical isolation and long-term evolutionary divergence are responsible for their differences in key biological characteristics, such as shape, individual development, and living habit  <cit> . apis cerana is adept at collecting sporadic nectar in the mountain or forest region and exhibits stiffer hardiness and acarid resistance as a result of natural selection. apis mellifera has the advantage of yielding royal jelly which is one of the main differences between these two honeybee species  <cit> . a previous study indicated that the mean length and the acini number of the apis mellifera hgs were significantly greater than those of the apis cerana hgs, and the royal jelly yielding ability of apis mellifera was more than ten-fold higher than that of apis cerana
 <cit> . fang et al. compared the protein profiles of royal jelly produced by apis mellifera ligustica and apis cerana cerana using proteomic approaches and identified that royal jelly proteins , peroxiredoxin  <dig>  and glutathione s-transferase s <dig> were differentially expressed  <cit> . however, no studies on the transcript and/or protein differences between the hgs of apis mellifera and apis cerana have been reported. detecting the gene expression difference in hgs between these two sibling species is important for understanding the mechanism of high royal jelly production.

the completion of the honeybee  genome sequencing  <cit>  and the development of high-throughput sequencing methods provide the possibility for us to investigate the genome-wide gene expression profile. the aim of this study was to use dge-tag analysis to identify genes specifically expressed in hgs that were associated with a significant difference in the production of royal jelly between apis mellifera and apis cerana. through dge sequencing and rigorous screening, we identified  <dig> degs between apis mellifera and apis cerana. our study provides valuable data for clarifying the molecular mechanism of hg development and a high yield of royal jelly in honeybees.

RESULTS
dge library sequencing
twelve dge-tag libraries were constructed and sequenced using the total rna extracted from the hgs of apis mellifera and apis cerana at the three developmental stages , which are three typical developmental stages of hgs. for each library, hgs dissected from  <dig> workers were pooled as a sample to construct the library. the sequencing results showed that the two biological replicates of each sample have a high reproducibility  , suggesting the high reliability of the sequencing results. after the low-quality tags, tags with a copy number less than two, and adaptor sequences were filtered, the remaining clean tags of each library were approximated  <dig>  million, and the percentage of clean tags among the raw tags in each library was approximately 98% with the exception of aml_forager  <dig> and aml_forager  <dig>  which were approximately  <dig> % . the percentages of unambiguous tags that could be mapped to reference genes  were approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % in apis mellifera and apis cerana samples, respectively . in each library, those tags with a copy number greater than  <dig> occupy more than 80% of the clean tags, showing a narrow distribution of distinct clean tags. in contrast, those tags with a copy number between  <dig> and  <dig> showed a broad distribution  of distinct clean tags .table  <dig>

to determine whether the depth of deep sequencing is sufficient, we performed a sequencing saturation analysis . when the sequencing amount of the twelve dge libraries reached a value close to 2 m, the number of detected genes reached a value near the limit, suggesting saturation of the sequencing depth.

degs between different developmental stages of the hypopharyngeal gland in apis mellifera
at the three developmental stages of apis mellifera,  <dig> of the annotated genes were detected . we then analyzed the gene expression differences between any two developmental stages of apis mellifera. a total of  <dig> genes showed an expression difference in at least one pairwise comparison. of these,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the comparisons among newly emerged worker vs. nurse, nurse vs. forager, and newly emerged worker vs. forager , respectively. among the three stages,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed their highest expression at the newly emerged worker, nurse and forager stages, respectively.figure  <dig>

we analyzed the expression pattern of the  <dig> degs at the three developmental stages of apis mellifera. contrary to our expectation, we haven’t observed a large number of up-regulated genes at the nurse stage. in general, the expression levels of the  <dig> genes in apis mellifera showed higher expression in the newly emerged worker bees and then gradually decreased with developmental progress .figure  <dig>

we compared our results with those from previous proteomics studies performed by feng et al.
 <cit> , in which  <dig> proteins were identified as differentially expressed between day  <dig> to day  <dig> in apis mellifera hgs. of these,  <dig> showed some expression difference in our study among the three developmental stages of hgs, and most of them showed a similar expression pattern to that reported by feng et al. this result to some extent confirmed the reliability of our experimental results.

because the transition from newly emerged worker bees to nurse bees is the critical period for royal jelly production, we paid more attention to the degs between these two stages. we found the alpha-amylase  and alpha-glucosidase , which have been repeatedly reported to be expressed specifically in the hgs of foragers and have been speculated to be related to the processing of nectar into honey  <cit> , were significantly up-regulated in nurses compared with the newly emerged workers and continued to be up-regulated in foragers, which is consistent with the proteomics results reported by li et al.
 <cit> . these two enzymes are involved in the digestion of carbohydrates. alpha-amylase is though to be needed to hydrolyze starch into glucose  <cit> . alpha-glucosidase can catalyze polysaccharide digestion and function in the final steps of starch digestion  <cit> . the up-regulation of these two genes at the nurse stage may be related to some other function with the exception of brewing honey.

although mrjps are the major protein components of the royal jelly, we only found one mrjp member, namely mrjp <dig>  expressed at its highest level at the nurse stage among the three stages. moreover, mrjp <dig>  and mrjp <dig>  exhibited strong expression in the newly emerged workers. however, these two genes showed no statistically significant difference between the newly emerged workers and nurses, although their tpm values in nurses were higher than those found in the newly emerged workers. feng et al. also found that mrjp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could be detected in the hgs of workers on day  <dig>  <cit> . these results suggested that the hgs of workers already have secretory activity before the nurse stage.

the go enrichment analysis of the degs between newly emerged workers and nurses showed that  <dig> items were significantly enriched  . the kegg pathway enrichment analysis of the degs between these two stages indicated that “ribosome”, “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum”, and “protein export” , which are related to protein synthesis or secretion, were significantly enriched items .

in the comparison between nurses and foragers, most of the degs are down-regulated in foragers. the go enrichment analysis revealed that eight items, including “macromolecular complex”, “ribonucleoprotein complex”, “intracellular”, “intracellular part”, “structural molecule activity”, “metal cluster binding”, “metabolic process”, and “gene expression”, were significantly enriched  . the kegg pathway enrichment analysis revealed that “ribosome”, “metabolic pathways”, “oxidative phosphorylation”, “parkinson’s disease”, “fatty acid metabolism”, and “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” were significantly enriched items  .

degs between different developmental stages of the hypopharyngeal gland in apis cerana
in apis cerana,  <dig> genes were detected to be transcribed at the three stages . a total of  <dig> genes showed an expression difference at least between two stages. of them,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed an expression difference in the comparisons of newly emerged worker vs. nurse, nurse vs. forager and newly emerged worker vs. forager , respectively. a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed their highest expression at the newly emerged worker, nurse, and forager stages, respectively.

similar to the findings found in apis mellifera, the  <dig> degs overall showed a higher expression in the newly emerged workers and decreased expression at the nurse stage. however, unlike the findings found in apis mellifera, most of these degs were slightly up-regulated at the forager stage compared with the nurse stage . the expression pattern of the  <dig> degs in apis cerana and the  <dig> degs in apis mellifera indicated that even though the hgs exhibit their highest activity for royal jelly secretion at the nurse stage, but no peak of a large amount of up-regulated genes was appeared in nurse. this expression pattern is in fact in accordance with the physiological activity of the hgs and can be reasonably explained. at the newly emerged worker stage, the hgs are in a phase of rapid growth, and a large number of genes are expressed at a higher level to promote their development. at the nurse stage, however, although the size and secretory activity of the hgs reach their maximum, the resources of the hg cells are mainly used for the synthesis of royal jelly; therefore, those genes related to royal jelly protein synthesis and secretion are highly expressed, whereas the expression level of the other genes are decreased. at the forager stage, the hgs of honeybees begin to shrink and their secretion activity is decreased, which leads to the expression level of most of the genes in hgs remaining at a relatively lower level or exhibiting a further declined.

of the degs found between newly emerged workers and nurses of apis cerana, we found several major royal jelly protein genes, including mrjp <dig> , mrjp <dig> , mrjp <dig> , and mrjp <dig> , were significantly up-regulated at the nurse stage, which is consistent with their function in the hg. alpha-glucosidase  and alpha-amylase  were also up-regulated in nurses.

the go enrichment analysis of the degs between newly emerged workers and nurses showed that  <dig> items were significantly enriched  . the kegg pathway enrichment analysis indicated that  <dig> items, including the above-mentioned three items found between newly emerged workers and nurses in apis mellifera, were significantly enriched  . these results are consistent with the physiological changes of honeybee hgs during this period.

between the nurse and forager stages, however, only one go item namely “protein tyrosine/serine/threonine phosphatase activity”, was significantly enriched  , and no kegg items were significantly enriched .

gene expression difference in the hypopharyngeal gland between apis mellifera and apis cerana
we compared the gene expression difference in hgs between apis mellifera and apis cerana and identified  <dig> degs between them . of them,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed an expression difference at the newly emerged, nurse, and forager stages, respectively. at the forager stage, more degs were up-regulated in apis cerana compared to apis mellifera, whereas at the newly emerged worker and nurse stages, the up-regulated degs in apis mellifera were markedly higher than those found in apis cerana . in particular, the nurse stage showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes between these two species, which could perhaps explain the phenomenon that the production of royal jelly in apis mellifera is much higher than that observed in apis cerana. many of the  <dig> degs exhibit important biological significance, including mrjps and genes related to cell development and differentiation, such as igf pathway genes and tor pathway genes.figure  <dig>

the go enrichment analysis of all of the  <dig> degs showed that “cytoplasmic part”, “cytoplasm”, “macromolecular complex”, “ribonucleoprotein complex”, “mitochondrion”, “mitochondrial part”, “structural molecule activity”, “metabolic process”, and “organic substance metabolic process” are dominant  . the kegg pathway enrichment analysis indicated that “ribosome”, “metabolic pathways”, “oxidative phosphorylation”, “parkinson’s disease”, “fatty acid metabolism”, “valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation”, and “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” were significantly enriched  .

mrjps
the mrjps are the main protein components of royal jelly. nine mrjp-encoding genes  have been identified from the honeybee genome. our results showed that most members of the mrjps  showed an expression difference between apis mellifera and apis cerana . of these, the mrjp <dig>  showed a significantly higher expression level in apis mellifera than in apis cerana at the newly emerged worker and forager stages but showed no significant expression difference at the nurse stage. mrjp <dig> is the most abundant protein in royal jelly  and the key factor for the induction of queen and worker differentiation  <cit> . we can speculate that the hgs of nurse bees of both apis mellifera and apis cerana need to synthesize a large amount of mrjp <dig> to maintain a basic function of the royal jelly. in addition to mrjp <dig>  mrjp <dig>  was also found to be expressed at a higher level in apis mellifera at the newly emerged worker and nurse stages. mrjp <dig>  and  <dig>  were constantly expressed at higher levels in apis mellifera at all three stages. in contrast, mrjp <dig> , mrjp <dig> , and mrjp <dig>  exhibited the opposite trend; mrjp <dig> and mrjp <dig> were constantly expressed at higher levels in apis cerana at all of the stages, and mrjp <dig> was expressed at a higher level at the forager stage. mrjp1- <dig> account for up to 90% of the most abundant proteins of royal jelly and have been repeatedly suggested to mainly have a nutritional function . thus, the high expression levels of mrjp <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in apis mellifera are consistent with their nutritional function. nevertheless, the high expression of mrjp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in apis cerana may be due to the non-nutritional function of mrjps, as has been reported in many studies . for example, a previous expression analysis reported that mrjp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> can be detected in mushroom bodies . mrjp <dig> and  <dig> are also expressed in drones  and queens   <cit> . more surprisingly, mrjp <dig> and  <dig>  which are rare in rj, could be detected in honeybee venom . all of the expression data lead to the conclusion that mrjps have important functions in general honeybee physiology in addition to just their nutritional value for developing larvae.figure  <dig>

ribosomal proteins
ribosomal proteins form the two subunits of the ribosome together with the rrnas and play an important role in intracellular protein synthesis  <cit> . of the degs, a total of  <dig> ribosomal protein genes, nearly one-third of all of the ribosomal protein genes in the honeybee genome, showed differential expression between apis mellifera and apis cerana. of them,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed an expression difference at the newly emerged worker, nurse, and forager stages, respectively. the gene expression cluster analysis indicated that most of these ribosomal protein genes were up-regulated in apis mellifera at the newly emerged worker and nurse stages . in particular at the nurse stage, the fold expression difference found for most of these ribosomal protein genes reached a maximum among the three stages. this finding implies that protein synthesis in the hgs of apis mellifera is more vigorous than that in apis cerana.figure  <dig>

tor, insulin/igf and tgf pathway genes
because the size of the apis mellifera hg is larger than that of apis cerana
 <cit> , we speculated that some genes related to cell growth and differentiation may contribute to this difference; thus, more attention was paid to genes in related signaling pathways, such as the tor, insulin/igf and tgf pathways. among the  <dig> degs, we found that two tor pathway genes, namely 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase  <dig>   and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e , and two insulin/igf pathways genes, namely igf-ii mrna-binding protein  and cell growth-regulating nucleolar protein-like , were significantly expressed higher in apis mellifera than in apis cerana at the newly emerged worker and nurse stages . the tor and insulin/igf signaling pathways have been identified as two main pathways that control cell growth through studies in model organisms  <cit> . the tor pathway acts as a nutrient sensor in multicellular organisms and regulates growth in response to nutrients, and the insulin/igf pathway is involved in coordinating cellular growth in response to endocrine signals and plays a key role in regulating growth in invertebrates and vertebrates  <cit> . the insulin and tor pathways form a signaling network that integrates information about nutrient availability and an intrinsic developmental program. in addition, the tgf-beta receptor  <dig> genes  were also expressed at higher levels in apis mellifera at the newly emerged worker and nurse stages. the tgf-β signaling pathway has been implicated as an important regulator of almost all major cell behaviors, including proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and motility  <cit> . the higher expression of these genes in apis mellifera may suggest that the up-regulation of these genes can promote the development of hgs, which to some extent leads to the higher yield of royal jelly.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first report of some degs in the hypopharyngeal gland between apis mellifera and apis cerana at the newly emerged worker, nurse and forager stages. our results confirmed that many degs may play an important role in the development of hgs and the secretion of royal jelly. all of the information obtained in our study contributes to further research on the specifically expressed genes in hg at the molecular level.
