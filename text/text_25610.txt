BACKGROUND
aminoacyl trna synthetases  play a central role in protein translation by covalently linking the correct amino acid to its cognate transfer rna  <cit> . this covalent linkage is a two-step aminoacylation reaction and ensures the fidelity of translation of the genetic code. in the first step, an amino acid  activated by atp, releases pyrophosphate  and is converted into the aminoacyl-adenylate  complex. this complex remains bound to the trna synthetase. in the second step, the activated amino acid is transferred onto the 2'-terminal or 3'-terminal ribose of the corresponding trna . the aarss also perform editing activity by clearance of mischarged trna  <cit> . the editing activity is shown by both class- <dig>  and class- <dig>  trna synthetases  <cit> . the defects in editing activity of aarss can be lethal and may lead to many pathological problems e.g. neuronal pathologies , autoimmune disorders and disrupted metabolic conditions  <cit> .

studies of trna and trna synthetases from bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals have shown that there are twenty aminoacyl trna synthetases in all organisms and each is specific for a single amino acid  <cit> . aminoacyl-trna synthetases differ in amino acid sequence length, three-dimensional structure, molecular weight, and subunit organization, and have limited sequence homology  <cit> . based on the multiple sequence analysis and the architecture of catalytic sites, aarss are divided into two classes of ten aarss each  <cit> . the structural characteristics of the catalytic domains of all aarss reveal that the active sites of class- <dig> enzymes contain the classical rossmann dinucleotide-binding fold and two signature peptides, high and kmsks. the active sites of class- <dig> aarss contain an anti-parallel Î²-sheet flanked by helices on both sides, and have three  signature motifs  <cit> . the catalytic site-based partition of aarss into two classes provides a strong correlation with function. an amino acid is transferred onto the 2'-oh group of the ribose of last nucleotide of trna by class- <dig>  and the 3'-oh group by class- <dig>  trna synthetases  <cit> . two synthetases pherss and lysrss are exceptions to this rule. all known pherss belong to class- <dig>  going by their structural characteristics, but transfer amino acids onto the 2'-oh group  <cit> . the lysyl-trna synthetases are found to belong both class- <dig> and class- <dig>  most of the lysrss are found in class- <dig> in many eubacteria and all eukaryotes, while class- <dig> lysrss are mainly found in archea and some eubacteria  <cit> . this class-determination is very important for the functional annotation of trna synthetases. at the present time, genome sequencing projects continuously produce huge amounts of sequence data, but the function of several proteins is still unclear. some aarss have been recognized as validated drug targets and one representing a potential drug target has been identified from each of the essential twenty aarss  <cit> . earlier many methods have been developed for the prediction of dna or rna binding proteins  <cit>  and further classification into mrna, rrna, trna & snrna binding protein  <cit> . in this paper, an attempt has been made to predict and classify aarss from the primary structure of protein. a novel hybrid approach based on svm and prosite has been adopted in order to predict the aarss and further classify them into two classes. in this hybrid approach, most distinguishable domains were selected from the prosite database by using the profilescan method of interproscan, and integrated in composition-based svm models. the domains ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig> were used for the prediction of aarss and one additional domain ps <dig> was integrated with svm for the classification of aarss into class- <dig> and class- <dig> 

RESULTS
sequence similarity search
it is a common trend to annotate a protein sequence using similarity-based approach like blast. thus, we developed a blast- based approach for discriminating aarss and non-aarss. as shown in table  <dig>  we achieved a maximum of  <dig> % accuracy at 10e-value. we have used the same strategy for the blast-based discrimination between class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss and found that the accuracy of blast at 10e-value was  <dig> %. it is possible to develop methods that result in higher accuracy with respect to blast-like method. thus, there is a need to develop models based on machine learning techniques to discriminate aarss versus non-aarss with high accuracy.

* the number of aarss/class- <dig> and non-aarss/class- <dig> having no hit  were considered as false negative and false positive respectively.

we have developed two different types of prediction methods:  prediction of aarss, and  discrimination between class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss. for each prediction, we applied five approaches:  domain-based approach,  svm modules using amino acid composition,  svm modules using dipeptide composition,  hybrid approach <dig> based on svm using composition and prosite domains and  hybrid approach <dig> based on svm using dipeptide composition and prosite domains. we trained and tested all our models on a 30% non-redundant dataset of aarss, non-aarss, class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss.

 prediction of aminoacyl trna synthetases
first we developed prediction tools for discriminating between aarss and non-aars. we used aarss and non-aarss as positive and negative instances respectively.

 domain-based approach
the weight matrix based signature profile gives evolutionary information of any protein family or group of protein sequences. it is possible to discriminate some protein families based on the distinguishable constant and variable regions  <cit> . so we used prosite from the profilescan method of interproscan  <cit> . we used aarss and non-aarss protein sequences, each group represented by  <dig> sequences. we analysed all profiles and selected the four most distinguishable domains which were ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig>  the accession numbers of profilescan and the short names of these domains are aa_trna_ligase_ii, aa_trna_ligase_i, aa_trna_ligase_ii_ala and aa_trna_ligase_ii_glyab respectively. it has been observed that 62% of aarss contain at least one of these prosite domains; about  <dig> % of non-aarss also contain one of the above-mentioned domains. this indicates that a domain based approach is not sufficient for discriminating amongst all aarss. thus, there is a need to develop sophisticated techniques, in combination with domain-based approaches. an svm-based classifier has been developed, using four dimensions of vector, one for each domain; this achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. in this dataset ~38% trna synthetases lacked any distinguishable prosite domains.

 svm modules using amino acid composition
it has been shown in the past that amino acid composition can be used to classify the different classes of proteins and developments of prediction tools using machine learning techniques  <cit> . we analysed amino acid compositions of aars and non-aars proteins . it has been observed that amino acid composition of aars and non-aars protein was significantly different from each other. thus, it was possible to discriminate aars proteins from other proteins based on amino acid composition. the svm-based classifier has been developed using  <dig> dimensions of vector, one for each amino acid. different kernels and parameters of svm have been tried and optimized for the best discrimination between aarss and non-aarss. we achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc.

 svm modules using dipeptide composition
in the previous studies, it has been shown that dipeptide composition-based methods are more successful than amino acid composition-based methods in the classification of proteins  <cit> , because the former incorporate the fraction of amino acids as well as their local order . an svm-based classifier was developed using  <dig> dimensions of vector  of dipeptide compositions, one for each dipeptide and this achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. we used svm attribute selection method by using weka and selected  <dig> distinguishable dipeptides . the compositions of these  <dig> dipeptides were significantly different in aars and non-aars protein sequences . different kernels and parameters of svm were tried, optimized and achieved maximum  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc.

 hybrid approach <dig> based on svm using composition and prosite domains
in this hybrid approach <dig>  we combined the  <dig> features of amino acid composition and  <dig> features of selected four domains of prosite and generated a vector of  <dig> dimensions. we developed svm based model and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc.

 hybrid approach <dig> based on svm using dipeptide and prosite domains
we generated a vector of  <dig> dimensions, which contain  <dig> features of dipeptide composition and  <dig> features of the selected four domains of prosite. we applied svm based learning using this vector and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. in the hybrid approach <dig>  we generated a vector of  <dig> dimensions, using composition of  <dig> selected dipeptides and  <dig> features of prosite domains. we developed svm model using above vector of dimensions  <dig> and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. we observed that hybrid approach <dig> performed much better than any other approaches developed in this study for predicting aarss .

 discriminating class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss
we further developed tools for discriminating class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss. we used class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss as positive and negative instances respectively. we applied same approaches and techniques, which have been used for the prediction of aarss.

 domain-based approach
we analysed all protein sequences of class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss by using profilescan. we selected five most distinguishable domains, which were ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig> . domains ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig> have been already used for the prediction of aarss. one additional domain ps <dig> is an s <dig> rna-binding domain profile and commonly found in tyrosyl-trna synthetases . it was observed that two domains  in class- <dig> and three domains  in class- <dig> are preferred. a svm-based classifier was developed using  <dig> features, one for each domain, and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. in this case, class- <dig> was considered as positive and class- <dig> as negative instances. it is shown in the results that the method was able to predict class- <dig> with 100% accuracy but failed to predict class- <dig>  thus there is a need to develop a method which can discriminate two classes with reasonable accuracy.

 svm modules using amino acid composition
we analysed and compared amino acid composition of class- <dig> and class- <dig> aars proteins, and observed significant differences between amino acid compositions . we applied svm using amino acid composition for discriminating two classes and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc.

 svm modules using dipeptide composition
an svm classifier has been developed using a vector of  <dig> dimensions  and it achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. we used svm attribute selection method by using weka and selected  <dig> distinguishable dipeptides . the composition of these  <dig> dipeptides was significantly different in class- <dig> and class- <dig> aars protein sequences . different kernels and parameters of svm were tried, optimized and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc.

 hybrid approach <dig> based on svm using composition and prosite domain
in the hybrid approach <dig>  a vector of  <dig> dimensions was created from five domains and the  <dig> features of amino acid composition. finally, an svm-based model has been developed using the above vector and this achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc.

 hybrid approach based on svm using dipeptide and prosite domain
we generated a total of  <dig> dimensions of vector by using  <dig> features of dipeptide composition and  <dig> features of the selected five domains of prosite. we applied svm-based learning and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. in the hybrid approach <dig>  we generated a total of  <dig> dimensions of vector by using  <dig> features of selected dipeptides and  <dig> features of prosite domains. we achieved maximum  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. here also we observed that svm-based hybrid approaches <dig> performed much better than other four approaches for the discrimination between class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss .

performance on the realistic dataset
in this study, we trained and tested our models on a dataset containing equal numbers of aarss and non-aarss. in reality, the number of aarss in a genome is not very high. thus, we created a realistic dataset, which contains  <dig> aarss and  <dig> non-aarss . we developed models using hybrid approach <dig>  for discriminating aarss and non-aarss on this realistic dataset. we achieved maximum  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig>  mcc . these results demonstrate that our approach is also effective on realistic dataset.

performance on independent dataset
it is important to evaluate a newly developed model on an independent dataset, not used for its training or testing. in order to create independent dataset, we retrieved total  <dig> newly added trna synthetases  from swiss-prot database. all the aarss having more than 30% sequence similarity with any other aarss have been removed. thus, the final independent dataset contains  <dig> non-redundant aarss. we have further created negative datasets of  <dig> non-aarss. the performances of our model developed using hybrid approach <dig> have been evaluated at various thresholds. we observed the performance of hybrid approach <dig> based svm model and achieved maximum  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig>  mcc. here also both the sensitivity and specificity shifted toward negative and positive thresholds respectively . the independent dataset contains  <dig> sequences of class- <dig> and  <dig> sequences of class- <dig> aarss. the hybrid approach <dig> based svm model predicted  <dig>  class- <dig> aarss and all  <dig>  class- <dig> correctly.

comparison with svm-prot
in the past, numbers of methods have been developed for predicting rna-binding proteins and class of enzymes . to the best of our knowledge, in this study, for the first time a method has been developed for prediction and classification of trna synthetases. svm-prot is one of the comprehensive methods developed for predicting enzyme families which includes trna synthetase. thus, we evaluated the performance of svm-prot  on  <dig> aarss used in our main dataset. svm-prot predicts various possible enzyme classes for query protein, with probability score. we used the highest probability score  of svm-prot  for analyzing predictions. it was observed that only  <dig> % of trna synthetases correctly predicted by svm-prot method. this demonstrates that our method is important for predicting and classifying aarss.

discussion
in recent years, rapid advances in genomics and proteomic studies have yielded a tremendous amount of data. the functional annotation of all these sequences using experimental approaches is a very labour-intensive and time-consuming process. therefore, computational approaches are required to fill the gap. the prediction based functional annotation of all protein classes is not possible. thus, it is important to concentrate on a single class of functionally important proteins. the aarss enzymes constitute a major protein class and play a vital role in protein synthesis. the catalytic activities of these aarss affect the determination of the genetic code. for this reason, they are essential for protein synthesis and cell viability. the catalytic specificity of aarss is necessary for cell survival. many natural compounds and antibiotics specifically target aarss, and inhibit the growth or survival of the target bacteria. the aarss have been already recognized as validated drug targets. in the present scenario, drug-resistance is continuously increasing for existing antibiotics and we need more novel antimicrobial agents directed against the novel targets. from all essential twenty aarss, each one represents a potential drug target. but these are still poorly exploited drug targets and only one aars inhibitor mupirocin is a marketed drug, which is specifically targeted against the isoleucyl-trna synthetase  <cit> . the investigation of aars families by genomic and biochemical research has been suggested. in this respect, aarss constitute a promising platform for the development of novel-antibiotics, and these are predicted to have no cross-resistance to other classical antibiotics  <cit> . this protein family has limited sequence homology, therefore we need more powerful computational tools than blast and other similarity based methods.

in order to assist biologists in assigning the function of unknown aars proteins, a systematic attempt has been made for predicting aars proteins and their classes. we obtained aarss protein sequences from the enzyme database of expasy and created class- <dig> and class- <dig> specific datasets. the creation of a negative dataset  is as important as positive datasets  for developing any classification method. thus, we manually extracted non-aarss from swiss-prot by using appropriate searching options. we selected four most distinguishable ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig> domains from prosite, which can discriminate aarss from non-aarss. in the classification between class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss, we selected one more ps <dig>  domain. the s <dig> is a small globular domain consisting of 60- <dig> amino acid residues, found in class- <dig>  and many other rna-related protein families but absent in class- <dig> aarss. domain ps <dig> contains the 'high' signature, which is a part of the adenylate binding site of class- <dig> aarss. class- <dig> aarss do not share a high degree of similarity; however, at least three conserved regions are present and ps <dig> is a domain of these conserved regions. ps <dig> and ps <dig> are the domains of alars and glyrs respectively and both belong to class- <dig> aarss. this information of domains was used for discrimination between class- <dig>  and class- <dig>  aarss. we have also found domain ps <dig>  which is a signature of trna binding domain. this is widely distributed among different trna synthetases  and found in their association factors   <cit> ; this is because we have not used it in our hybrid approach. the main limitation is that ~38% aarss do not contain any of these distinguishable domains. we implemented svm for the prediction and classification of aarss because machine learning-based approaches were essential for the development of prediction tools. we have found that composition of  <dig> dipeptides  were significantly different in aarss and non-aarss. the fraction of  <dig> dipeptides  is different in class- <dig> and class- <dig> aarss. the svm module based on hybrid approach <dig>  achieved higher accuracy in comparison to amino acid composition, dipeptide composition and hybrid approach <dig> , both in the prediction of aarss and class-specific predictions. it showed that the aarss or class-specific aarss that failed to be predicted by dipeptide composition could be predicted by hybrid approaches <dig> containing additional information of prosite. these domains contain information about the constant regions inside the aarss protein sequences during their development and throughout evolution. therefore, it is better to use the combined approach for functional analysis where there are unique domains. we implemented all approaches in our web-server "icaars" and by default, it uses a hybrid approach <dig>  we anticipate that users will be willing to query many sequences at a time and our online server "icaars" will take time accordingly. we are in the process of developing stand-alone version to help annotation faster. we hope that an annotation of aarss enzyme will be helpful for the designing of new drug-targets and drug-discovery processes.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, the present work is an attempt to predict and classify aminoacyl trna synthetases. we analysed protein sequences of aarss  and non-aarss and selected the distinguishable patterns. these were amino acid, dipeptide, hybrid approach <dig> and hybrid approach <dig>  we used these features as a svm input based machine learning. we were able to model an efficient classifier from hybrid approach <dig> based information. a server icaars has been developed based on the svm modules obtained.
