BACKGROUND
the basic repeating structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome core particle , which is a structured package of 147 bps of dna and a histone octamer consisting of  <dig> copies of each core histone: h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  there are also linker histones, h <dig>  flanking ncps and sealing the structure with about 20 bps of additional dna. the involvement of h <dig> is crucial for the formation and stabilization of chromatin structures and for the regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

there are  <dig> variants of linker histone h <dig> in mammalian cells: somatic replication-dependent variants , somatic replication-independent variants , and germ cell specific variants   <cit> . the replication-dependent variants are typically expressed during s phase and are incorporated during into chromatin during dna replication, while the replication-independent variants are expressed throughout the cell cycle and can be incorporated into chromatin outside of s phase. the sequences of these h <dig> variants vary greatly in their c-terminal domains. the individual functions of h <dig> variants are not fully understood. it was believed that h <dig> served as a global gene regulator by binding to chromatin non-specifically. however, although partially redundant in function, there is evidence indicating h <dig> variants have distinct roles in gene regulation and development. while deleting a single h <dig> variant did not lead to any observable phenotype, the h <dig> /h <dig> /h <dig>  triple knockout mouse exhibited developmental defects and embryonic lethality  <cit> . microarray experiments showed that knockdown of each h <dig> variant altered a different subset of genes  <cit> . the expression levels and activities of the h <dig> variants were also found to be highly regulated during cell differentiation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . these observations suggest the hypothesis that each h <dig> variant has its individual function in the cells in addition to their roles as global chromatin modifiers.

studies on core histones indicate that replication-dependent and replication-independent histone variants can be involved in distinct protein complexes and assembly pathways. for example, histone h <dig>  is assembled into chromatin in coordination with dna replication during s phage, while another variant, h <dig> , is exchanged throughout the cell cycle. the dynamics of h <dig>  and h <dig>  are mediated by distinct protein complexes that contain different chaperones for each of the h <dig> variants. while h <dig>  and h <dig>  complexes have some shared histone associated proteins, such as nasp, asf1a, asf1b, hat <dig>  and importin  <dig>  there are also exclusive histone binding partners in each complex. all three subunits of histone chaperone caf- <dig> are only found in the h <dig>  complex, while another histone chaperone, hira, is only found in the h <dig>  complex  <cit> . caf- <dig> and hira then dictate the replication-coupled and replication-independent assembly of these h <dig> variants.

currently it is not known whether the dynamics of replication-dependent and -independent variants of h <dig> are also regulated by distinct chaperones in a manner similar to h <dig>  and h <dig>  complexes. previous studies proposed several linker histone chaperone candidates: nucleosome assembly protein  <dig>  <cit> , nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein   <cit> , nucleophosmin   <cit> , prothymosin α   <cit> , and template activating factor-i   <cit> . the roles of these interactions between histone h <dig> and linker histone chaperones in h <dig> storage, transport, chromatin assembly and disassembly are not fully understood. how the linker histone chaperones interact with each h <dig> variant also remains to be determined. to better understand h <dig> variant - protein interactions, we purified non-chromatin associated protein complexes containing 6 × his-tagged h <dig> variants expressed in tetracycline-inducible u2os cell lines using column chromatography. proteins associated with each h <dig> variant were identified by mass spectrometry analysis. we found replication-dependent and replication-independent h <dig> variants had distinct binding partners. for example, one protein bound to replication-dependent h <dig>  and h <dig> , nucleoprotein tpr, was not found in the protein complex containing replication-independent h1x. tpr knockdown leads to decreased levels of h <dig>  and h <dig> , but does not affect h1x levels. these findings suggest that association with variant-specific binding partners may regulate linker histone dynamics.

RESULTS
generation of inducible u2os cell lines expressing 6 × his-tagged h <dig> variants
to purify h <dig> variants and their associated proteins for identification, we generated tetracycline-inducible u2os cell lines over-expressing 6 × his-tagged h <dig> variants h <dig> , h <dig>  or h1x by transfecting u2os cells engineered for tetracycline-inducible expression with pt-rex-dest <dig> plasmids carrying the corresponding h <dig> variant sequences . cellular fractionation revealed that the vast majority of 6 × his-tagged linker histones were in the nuclear fraction , indicating the exogenous h <dig> proteins were properly localized. since histone proteins are highly basic, excess accumulation of histones could disrupt normal chromatin structures and cause cytotoxicity. to verify that our over-expression of h <dig> variants did not disrupt normal cell functions, we isolated total histones from uninduced and doxycycline-induced u2os cells. figure 1c shows a coomassie stained gel of uninduced and induced cells expressing histone h <dig> , h <dig>  and h1x. it is clear that h <dig> induction does not result in an overall increase in linker histone abundance. mnase digestion assays further confirmed that over-expression of 6 × his-tagged h <dig> variants did not significantly alter nucleosome organization or repeat length . thus we conclude that these cell lines are suitable as the source for h1-containing protein complex purification.fig.  <dig> over-expression of 6 × his-tagged h <dig> variants does not alter global chromatin structure. a u2os tet/on cells were transfected with plasmids encoding 6 × his-tagged human histone h <dig> variants. these cells were incubated 72 h with or without doxycycline before extracted. whole cell extracts were resolved by sds-page gel, and immunoblotted with anti-his antibodies. b untransfected  u2os tet/on cells or u2os tet/on cells expressing h <dig> variants  were incubated with doxycycline for 72 h. whole cell, cytosolic and nuclear extracts of these cells were resolved by sds-page gels and visualized by western blotting with antibodies targeting proteins indicated on the right. c total histones were extracted from untransfected  u2os tet/on cells or doxycycline-induced u2os cells expressing 6 × his-tagged h <dig> variants  using acid precipitation method. 30 μg of each sample was resolved by sds-page gel, and visualized by coomassie staining or immunoblotting with anti-his antibodies. d–f nuclei from uninduced  or doxycycline induced  u2os cells transfected with vectors expressing h <dig>   , h <dig>   or h1x  were digested with  <dig>  u/ml  of mnase at 37 °c for various lengths of time, then quenched with edta. digested dna samples were purified using phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and resolved on 1 % agarose gel with etbr staining



purification and identification of h <dig> complexes
to analyze proteins associating with the soluble pool of the h <dig> variants, we purified h <dig> , h <dig>  and h1x from u2os whole cell extracts by sequential chromatography with an anion exchange column  and an affinity column . the specific order of the chromatography was used to optimize the concentration of proteins prior to mass spec analysis. interestingly, h <dig>  eluted in two separate peaks on the mono q column, while h <dig>  and h1x both eluted in only one peak . each peak eluting from the mono q column was collected and pooled separately, and chromatographed on a nickel chelate column . we performed mock purification from whole cell extracts of untransfected u2os tet/on cells, which did not express 6 × his-tagged proteins, to serve as negative controls. for the mock purifications, extracts were resolved on a mono q column and the fractions containing an equivalent salt concentration as the peak of the h1-containing fractions was then resolved on a nickel chelating column.fig.  <dig> purification of h <dig> , h <dig>  and h1x complexes. a–c soluble whole cell extracts of u2os cells expressing 6 × his - tagged h <dig>  , h <dig>   or h1x  were purified on a mono q column. top panel: 1 ml fractions were collected, resolved by sds-page gel, and immunoblotted with anti-his antibodies. bottom panel: chromatogram showing chromatography conditions used. d–f peaks containing 6 × his – tagged h <dig>  , h <dig>   or h1x  from mono q column were pooled and applied to a nickel column in loading buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, washed with 50 mm imidazole and then eluted with 500 mm imidazole. top panel: 1 ml fractions were collected, resolved by sds-page gel, and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-his antibodies. bottom panel: chromatogram showing chromatography conditions used



peak samples eluting from the nickel chelate column containing each histone variant, as well as the comparable negative control fraction, were analyzed in duplicate by mass spectrometry. a complete list of the proteins identified, as well as the number of unique peptides observed in each analysis, is listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the distribution of specificities of the identified linker histone binding proteins for h <dig> , h <dig>  and h1x is represented by a venn diagram in fig. 3a. approximately half of the proteins identified interact with more than one linker histone variant while half are specific for a single h <dig> species.fig.  <dig> graphical representation of identified linker histone binding proteins. a venn diagram of the distribution of proteins co-purifying with histones h <dig> , h <dig>  and h1x . b venn diagram of the distribution of linker histones binding proteins identified in the current study   <cit> . c venn diagram of the overlap of liner histone binding proteins identified from u2os cells in the current study and the study of kalashnikove et al.  <dig>   <cit> 



the protein list contains a large number of ribosomal proteins. several recent proteomic studies have also found that linker histones bind to ribosomes and this interaction has been implicated in transcriptional repression . recent proteomic studies of linker histone binding proteins have used a fundamentally different approach where a histone h <dig> variant was immobilized and incubated with nuclear or nucleolar extracts  <cit> . in addition to these differences in experimental approach, these studies used a different linker histone variant than those used in the current study. despite these differences, there is significant overlap in the h <dig> interacting proteins identified. as seen in fig. 3b, there is approximately 30 % overlap in the linker histone binding proteins identified in the current study and in the previous studies. in addition, if only the linker histone binding proteins identified from the same cell line are considered , the current study identified more than half of the linker histone binding proteins found by kalashnikova and colleagues .

table  <dig> lists all of the non-ribosomal proteins found to co-purify with the linker histones that were detected by at least  <dig> peptides in both of the duplicate samples . these proteins are divided into  <dig> groups based on their pattern of interaction. group  <dig> consists of the proteins that co-purified with all three linker histones. group  <dig> proteins co-purified with the replication-dependent h <dig>  and h <dig>  but not with the replication-independent h1x. group  <dig>  group  <dig> and group  <dig> proteins were specifically associated with a single histone h <dig> variant  and, as expected, each of these groups contained the corresponding h <dig> variant . group  <dig> proteins were associated with both histone h <dig>  and h1x.table  <dig> linker histone binding proteins

table lists the selected proteins identified by mass spectrometry associated with the linker histones h <dig> , h <dig>  and h <dig> x . table lists the average number of peptides identified from each linker histone purification. the averages are derived from  <dig> to  <dig> replicates. * denotes proteins identified in histone h <dig>  mono-q peak  <dig>   = all h1’s ,  = h <dig>  and h <dig>  ,  = h <dig>  ,  = h <dig>  ,  = h <dig> x ,  = h <dig>  and h <dig> x 



the group  <dig> proteins included two proteins that had previously been identified as histone chaperones, nucleolin and nucleophosmin   <cit> . nucleolin and nucleophosmin are broad specificity histone binding proteins and have been found to associate with both core and linker histones . group  <dig> also included the ssrp subunit of the fact complex, which also has been shown to interact with both core and linker histones  <cit> . the second subunit of fact, spt <dig>  was identified as specifically interacting with histone h <dig> . however, this classification was due to a high level of spt <dig> peptides in the negative control sample. therefore, it is likely that both subunits of fact are bound to all three of the linker histone variants tested.

group  <dig> also included srp <dig> and srp <dig>  components of the signal recognition particle, srp <dig> and srp <dig> have also been shown to form a heterodimeric complex distinct from the signal recognition particle. in addition to its role in translation, the srp68/ <dig> complex was also found to bind histone h <dig> molecules that contain arginine  <dig> methylation  <cit> .

ybx <dig> and ybx <dig> also co-purified with all three linker histones. y box-binding proteins bind to y box consensus promoter elements and are involved in mrna processing  <cit> . ybx <dig> was found to be recruited together with purα and histone h <dig>  to the p <dig> target gene bax in order to repress p53-induced transcription  <cit> . our data indicates that ybx <dig> not only associates with h <dig> variant h <dig> , but with h <dig>  and h1x as well. interestingly, these y box proteins were only detected in the h <dig>  complex that corresponded to the second peak of h <dig>  on the mono q column.

five of the group  <dig> proteins are linked to n6-methyladenosine modification of mrna. vir , wtap , zc3h <dig> and hakai are all components of the wtap complex that serves to target the mettl <dig> and mettl <dig> methyltransferases to their substrate . in addition, ytdc <dig> is a yth domain protein that can function as a reader of n6-methyladenosine .

the remaining group  <dig> proteins include a cyclin/cdk complex; ccnl <dig> and cdk11b. linker histones are highly phosphorylated and often used as non-specific substrates in kinase assays. in fact, cdk11b has been shown to be able to phosphorylate histone h <dig> in vitro  <cit> . the observation that the ccnl1/cdk11b complex can be purified in association with linker histones suggests that h1s may be a specific substrate of this kinase complex. finally, all three h <dig> variants associate with the ubiquitin hydrolase ubp <dig> 

the group  <dig> proteins bind specifically to the replication-dependent h <dig> variants h <dig>  and h <dig>  but don’t form a complex with the replication-independent variant h1x. the group  <dig> proteins include  <dig> subunits of the paf <dig> complex, paf <dig>  ctr <dig>  cdc <dig> and leo <dig>  <cit> . the specificity of the interaction between the paf <dig> complex and h <dig>  and h <dig>  is consistent with a recent study that showed that paf <dig> co-purified with epitope tagged h <dig>  and h <dig>  but not with the other replication-dependent h <dig> variants h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig>  or with the replication-independent variant h <dig> . the association of the paf <dig> complex with h <dig>  and h <dig>  was shown to function with cul4a in transcription-associated ubiquitylation  <cit> .

chd <dig> has previously been shown to function in transcriptional repression of p <dig> and β-catenin target genes through the recruitment of histone h <dig>  <cit> . the proteomic data presented here suggests that the interaction between chd <dig> and linker histones is variant specific.

the nuclear pore complex protein tpr was also found to be replication-coupled h <dig> variant specific. tpr  is a component of the nuclear pore complex , forming fibrous structures that extend into the nuclear interior  <cit> . tpr is required for establishing heterochromatin exclusion zones in the vicinity of npcs  <cit> . in addition to its roles in npc architecture, tpr is also involved in mrna, unspliced rna and nuclear protein export . depletion of tpr induces nuclear accumulation of p <dig>  and facilitates autophagy  <cit> .

proteins that specifically co-purified with histone h <dig>   included several known histone chaperones. napp1l <dig> and set were recently shown to bind histone h <dig>  in vitro  <cit> . nap1l <dig> has not previously been demonstrated to interact with linker histones.

group  <dig> contained several proteins involved in rna metabolism. these included three poly a binding proteins, pabp <dig>  pabp <dig> and pabp <dig>  as well as the rnasep subunit pop <dig>  <cit> . in addition, proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, nde <dig>  ubf <dig> and s30bp were also found to be specific for histone h <dig> .

h <dig>  specific binding partners  included dna damage-binding protein  <dig>  and protein vprbp . ddb <dig> and vprbp are both members of an e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, named cul4a-rbx1-ddb1-dcaf1/vprbp complex, which is responsible for methylation-dependent ubiquitylation  <cit> . vprbp and ddb <dig> were recently shown to co-purify with both h <dig>  and h <dig>  along with cul4a and the paf <dig> complex  <cit> . the distinct properties of the paf <dig> and cul4a complex subunits in the u2os cells suggest that the specificity of the interaction between the cul4a complex and linker histones is subject to cell type specific regulation.

group  <dig> contained two rna helicases, ddx <dig> and ddx <dig> and the nucleolar rna binding protein ebp <dig>  group  <dig> also contained the transcriptional regulators taf <dig> and tif1b, as well as chd <dig>  while chd <dig> has not been shown to be associated with linker histones, these results suggest that it may function in a manner analogous to chd <dig> 

only two proteins were found to be exclusive binding partners of h1x . these were ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase  <dig>  and insulin-like growth factor  <dig> mrna-binding protein  <dig> . usp <dig> is a deubiquitinating enzyme that can bind to ubiquitinated h2a/h2b dimers, and removes ubiquitin from ubiquitinated h2b that are not in nucleosomes  <cit> . igfbp <dig> belongs to a family of three igf-ii mrna-binding proteins that can bind to the 5′ utr of the insulin-like growth factor ii leader  <dig> mrna and regulate the translation of insulin-like growth factor ii during late mammalian development  <cit> . interactions between usp <dig> and igfbp <dig> and linker histones have not been reported previously.

group  <dig> is an eclectic collection of proteins that co-purified with both h <dig>  and h1x. this group includes the rna binding proteins srsf <dig> and srsf <dig>  the zinc finger protein znf <dig> and the anti-microbial protein dermcidin.

interactions between nucleoprotein tpr and h <dig> variants
the proteomics data clearly demonstrate that linker histones participate in a complex set of interactions that display varying degrees of specificity for the h <dig> variants. to explore in more detail the distinction between replication-dependent  and replication-independent  h <dig> variants, we examined whether the specificity observed for replication-dependent h <dig>  and h <dig>  displayed by tpr was a reflection of a specific in vivo connection between tpr and replication-dependent linker histones. unlike the paf- <dig> complex and chd <dig>  which were also identified in the h <dig>  and h <dig>  complexes but not in the h1x complex , tpr has not been previously shown to interact with linker histones. to confirm the potential for interactions between tpr and h <dig> variants in vivo, we resolved soluble whole cell extracts of u2os cells expressing h <dig> , h <dig>  or h1x by size exclusion chromatography . in all three cases, the peaks of h <dig> variants overlapped with the tpr peak in a very high molecular weight complex . these large complexes are likely due to other proteins associated with tpr and/or h <dig> variants through direct or indirect interactions. the overlapping elution profiles of the linker histones and tpr is consistent with the possibility that tpr can form complexes with the linker histones in vivo but does not provide biochemical evidence for specific association of tpr with the replication-dependent linker histones. recprical co-immunopreciptations were also attempted to obtain additional evidence for for the specific interactions between tpr and linker histones. however, currently available anti-tpr antibodies were efficient for the immunopreciptation of tpr and its associated proteins.fig.  <dig> tpr co-elutes with h <dig> variants on size exclusion column. soluble whole cell extracts of u2os cells expressing 6 × his - tagged h <dig>  , h <dig>   or h1x  were resolved by gel filtration chromatography . fractions  were precipitated with 20 % w/v tca, then resolved by sds-page gel, and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-tpr or anti-his antibodies



tpr knockdown specifically reduces replication-dependent h <dig> variant levels via protein degradation
to determine whether the observed interactions between tpr and replication-dependent linker histones are functionally relevant, we treated u2os cells expressing 6 × his-tagged h <dig> , h <dig>  or h1x with tpr-targeting sirna in order to knockdown the expression of tpr proteins. surprisingly, we found that sitpr treated cells, which had significantly reduced tpr immunofluorescence signals, also showed reduced immunofluorescence signals of 6 × his-tagged replication-dependent variants h <dig>  and h <dig> , but not replication-independent variant h1x . in both control sirna and tpr sirna treated cells, all three h <dig> variants were localized within the nucleus, indicating that the loss of tpr did not disrupt the nuclear distribution of histone h <dig>  the fluorescence intensities of the signals for tpr and the h <dig> variants, relative to the signal for dapi, were quantitated and plotted . based on a linear regression analysis of the data there was a clear positive correlation between the level of tpr and the levels of histone h <dig>  and h <dig>   while there was no correlation between the level of tpr and the level of h1x . consistent with the immunofluorescence data, we also observed reduced h <dig>  and h <dig>  protein levels in tpr sirna treated cells on western blots; however h1x protein levels were not affected .fig.  <dig> tpr knockdown specifically reduces replication-dependent h <dig> variant h <dig>  and h <dig>  levels. a untransfected  u2os tet/on cells or u2os tet/on cells expressing h <dig> variants  were treated with either control sirna or sirna targeting protein tpr for 72 h. the cells were simultaneously stained with dapi , anti-tpr , and anti-his . overlay of anti-tpr and anti-his staining was shown for comparison. b scatter plot of quantified fluorescence intensities from fig. 5a. quantification and regression analysis was performed as described in experimental procedures. c untransfected  u2os tet/on cells or u2os tet/on cells expressing h <dig> variants  were treated with either control sirna or sirna targeting protein tpr for 72 h. 20 μg whole cell extracts of each sample were resolved on sds-page gel, and visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies targeting proteins indicated on the right



the reduction in h <dig>  and h <dig>  levels in tpr knockdown cells could have been a result of a decrease in mrna abundance or by protein destabilization. in order to investigate the effect of tpr depletion on histone h <dig> gene expression, we performed quantitative real-time pcr analysis on the mrna levels of h <dig> , h <dig> , and h1x in u2os cells treated with either control sirna or tpr sirna. tpr knockdown did not cause any significant decrease in the mrna levels of any of the three h <dig> variants .fig.  <dig> tpr stabilizes replication-dependent h <dig> variant h <dig>  and h <dig>  by preventing protein degradation. a–b mrna levels of h <dig> , h <dig>  or h1x were quantified by quantitative real-time pcr in untransfected u2os tet/on cells  or u2os tet/on cells expressing h <dig> variants h <dig> , h <dig>  or h1x  treated with either control sirna or sirna targeting tpr for 48 h. expression levels of histone h <dig> genes were normalized relative to levels of gapdh. each experiment was completed on three biological replicates where each biological replicate was obtained in triplicate, and the mean of these values was used for further analysis. statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired student’s t-test: p ≤  <dig>  , p ≤  <dig>  , and p ≤  <dig>  . the data are presented as means ± standard deviations . c untransfected  u2os tet/on cells or u2os tet/on cells expressing h <dig> variants  were treated with either control sirna or sirna targeting protein tpr for 72 h. for the last 3 h of sirna transfection, 20 μm of mg <dig> was added to the media. 20 μg whole cell extracts of each sample were resolved on sds-page gel, and visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies targeting proteins indicated on the right. d untransfected  u2os tet/on cells or u2os tet/on cells expressing h <dig> variants  were treated with either control sirna or sirna targeting protein tpr for 72 h. for the last 3 h of sirna transfection, 20 μm of mg <dig> was added to the media. treated cells were then simultaneously stained with dapi , tpr , and 6 × his-tag . overlay of anti-tpr and anti-his staining was shown for comparison. e scatter plot of quantified fluorescence intensities from fig. 6d. quantification and regression analysis was performed as described in experimental procedures



to test whether tpr is required for histone h <dig>  and h <dig>  protein stability, we treated u2os cells with mg <dig>  which is a cell permeable proteasome inhibitor. in the presence of mg <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  protein levels were restored in tpr sirna treated cells to levels comparable to those of control sirna treated cells . immunofluorescence microscopy of mg <dig> treated cells also confirmed this rescue of h <dig>  and h <dig>  protein levels . quantitation of the immunofluorescence data indicated a clear decrease in the correlation of the levels of tpr and histones h <dig>  and h <dig>  with an increase in the number of cells with a low level of tpr that maintain a high level of the replication-dependent linker histones . it is important to note that in mg <dig> treated cells all h <dig> variants were still localized within the nucleus, indicating that loss of tpr did not cause replication-dependent h <dig> proteins to accumulate in the cytosol suggesting that tpr is not required for the nuclear import of replication-dependent linker histones. these results suggest that the specific interaction between tpr and replication-dependent histone h <dig> variants detected biochemically is a reflection of a specific in vivo interaction. further, the interaction between tpr and histones h <dig>  and h <dig>  is critical to maintain the proper abundance of these linker histones.

discussion
there is accumulated evidence indicating functional differentiation among linker histone variants. the abundance of h <dig> variants fluctuates in diverse cell types and at development stages  <cit> . their ability to condense chromatin also varies . in addition, the h <dig> variants can engage in a wide range of different protein-protein interactions . several previous proteomic studies focused on the characterization of the linker histone variants h <dig>  and h <dig>  interaction networks, however the comparison of replication-dependent and replication-independent h <dig> variants is still lacking  <cit> . in order to understand how replication-dependent and replication-independent h <dig> variants carry out differentiated functions through protein-protein interactions, we purified protein complexes containing 6 × his-tagged replication-dependent h <dig> variants h <dig>  and h <dig> , or replication-independent variant h1x, and identified their binding partners using mass spectrometric analysis.

broadly speaking, our proteomic characterization of linker histones binding proteins identifies four groups of proteins that interact with linker histones. we used soluble whole cell extracts as the starting material for the h <dig> purifications to facilitate the identification of histone chaperones that would regulate the transport and assembly of the linker histones. indeed, a significant fraction of the h <dig> interacting proteins are previously known histone-binding proteins. while many of these proteins have primarily been characterized in the context their functions as core histone chaperones, it will be interesting to determine how they also impact linker histone dynamics.

the well-characterized function of linker histones in the regulation of transcription is reflected in the abundance of transcription factors identified as linker histone binding proteins. the observation that some transcription factors are highly specific for a single histone h <dig> variant suggests that some of the unique functions of the linker histones may be mediated by protein-protein interactions that regulate specific subsets of genes.

the other two groups of proteins were related to rna biology. the largest groups of interacting factors were ribosomal proteins. the interaction of linker histones with ribosomes has been observed both in vitro and in vivo and has been implicated in transcriptional repression  <cit> . we also identified a number of proteins involved in rna metabolism including rna binding proteins and rna helicases. surprisingly, multiple members of the wtap complex, which is required for a significant fraction of the n6-methyladenosine modification in the cell, as well as the n6-methyladenosine reader protein ytdc <dig> were associated with all three h <dig> variants  <cit> . together, these results suggest the intriguing possibility that linker histones may provide an important link between chromatin structure and rna metabolism.

surprisingly, nasp  was not found to associate with any of the histone h <dig> variants in the present study and has not been identified in the recent proteomic analyses of in vivo linker histone complexes  <cit> . nasp was one of the first proteins proposed to be a linker histone chaperone and, in fact, can bind linker histones with nm affinity in vitro . the inability to identify nasp as linker histone-associated protein in multiple studies suggests a number of possibilities. nasp may not interact with linker histones to a significant extent despite the demonstrated in vitro affinity. alternatively, nasp may interact in vivo with only a subset of the linker histone variants that have not yet been examined by proteomic methods.

in comparing the proteins that co-purified with each of the h <dig> variants, we found that the three h <dig> variants had shared binding partners that were identified in earlier studies, such as nucleophosmin, nucleolin and fact complex subunits spt <dig> and ssrp <dig>  nucleolin, nucleophosmin  and y box-binding proteins yb <dig>  yb <dig> and yb <dig>  these h1-associating proteins may contribute to the common functions of h <dig> variants. importantly, we identified shared components found in the replication-dependent h <dig> variant complexes that were not associated replication-independent h <dig> variants. these factors include the paf <dig> complex, chd <dig> and nucleoprotein tpr. the recent study from kim and colleagues demonstrated that the paf <dig> complex is not associated with histone h <dig>  consistent with the specificity of this complex for replication-dependent linker histones  <cit> . these exclusive protein-protein interactions may be crucial for mediating cell cycle-dependent functions of h <dig> variants.

the interactions of the paf- <dig> complex and chd <dig> with linker histones have demonstrated functions in transcriptional regulation . however, a link between tpr and linker histones has not previously been identified. our analysis of tpr sirna knockdown cells supports the proteomic data that indicated that tpr engages in specific interactions as tpr knockdown reduced the levels of replication-dependent h <dig> variants h <dig>  and h <dig> , but not replication-dependent h <dig> variant h1x. future studies will determine whether tpr also interacts with the remaining replication-dependent linker histones, h <dig> , h <dig>  and h <dig>  or, whether, like the paf <dig> complex, it is specific for h <dig>  and h <dig> .

while tpr is required for the stability of histones h <dig>  and h <dig> , the functional significance of their interaction is not clear. as tpr is a component of the nuclear pore complex, the most straightforward model is that tpr is specifically involved in the nuclear import of replication-dependent linker histones. this model predicts that if the levels of h <dig>  and h <dig>  were restored in cells lacking tpr that the histones would accumulate in the cytoplasm. however, when the tpr sirna knockdown was performed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig>  we observed no cytoplasmic accumulation of h <dig>  and h <dig> .

a second possibility is that tpr can function as a histone chaperone that participates in the targeting of replication-dependent linker histones to sites of chromatin assembly. indeed, tpr contains a region nears the cooh-terminus that is highly enriched in aspartic acid and glutamic acid as is observed in many histone chaperones. in addition, a recent proteomic analysis of nascent chromatin structure identified tpr as a chromatin-associated protein  <cit> .

another potential function for the interaction of tpr with histones h <dig>  and h <dig>  may be related to involvement of tpr in the formation of heterochromatin exclusion zones  around nuclear pores. while heterochromatin localizes near the nuclear envelope, regions near the nuclear pores are devoid of heterochromatin through the formation of tpr-dependent hezs  <cit> . the interaction between tpr and replication-dependent h <dig> variants may be important for the maintenance of hezs. tpr may stabilize and preserve h <dig> variants with minimal dna compaction abilities, such as h <dig>  and h <dig> , which establishes a basal level of chromatin packaging around hezs, while keeping out h <dig> variants that promote strong condensation, such as h1x. to test this hypothesis, it would be interesting to investigate the interactions between tpr and other h <dig> variants with higher affinity and/or higher capacity for the compaction of nucleosomes, such as h <dig>  and h <dig>  .

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated and analyzed the soluble forms of the replication-dependent linker histones h <dig>  and h <dig>  and the replication-independent linker histone h1x. these linker histones interact with both a common group of proteins and with variant-specific interacting proteins. one protein that is specifically associated with h <dig>  and h <dig>  is nuclear pore complex protein tpr. tpr was not required for the nuclear import of histones h <dig>  and h <dig> . however, knockdown of tpr expression resulted in a specific decrease in protein stability of the replication-dependent linker histones.
