BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae  continues to cause high morbidity and mortality worldwide, in spite of the availability of vaccines and antimicrobial therapies  <cit> . resistance of virulent s. pneumoniae to multiple antibiotics, particularly against beta-lactams is due to alterations in the structure of six penicillin-binding proteins, while macrolide resistance is mediated through the erm, mefa or mefe genes  <cit> . this could partly be explained by the fact that the organism deploys an efficient virulence machinery during infection. consequently, research efforts have been geared towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease . however, due to technical difficulties associated with harvesting rna for analysis of in vivo transcription patterns of pneumococci during pathogenesis, most studies have either studied the earlier stages of infection  or used in vitro surrogates . recently, these challenges have been largely overcome by studies involving transcriptomic comparisons of differentially-regulated genes during penetration of deeper host tissues .

notwithstanding these significant advances, progress on a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of pneumococcal pathogenesis is still hampered by paucity of data on different levels of functional genomics , particularly for pneumococci with distinct pathogenicity characteristics. it is known that gene function is the outcome of harmony between the upstream non-coding promoter region and the downstream coding sequence  <cit>  . despite the prominent role of transcription factors  in controlling the expression of many genes  <cit> , their impact on pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease has not been studied in detail, probably due to their transient, and generally low expression levels. a study of  <dig> bacterial genomes showed that larger genomes harbour more tfs per gene than smaller ones  <cit> . this suggests that under complex conditions, gene expression, regulation and signal integration have been strongly selected to enable rapid adaptation to environmental conditions, triggering emergence of new strains. a differential fluorescence induction study showed that pneumococcal surface antigen  promoter, which drives expression of the psabca operon involved in manganese uptake and virulence in s. pneumoniae
 <cit>  is markedly activated during lung infection  <cit> . recently, we found a novel transcriptional regulatory circuit consisting of two tfs  plays a significant role in pathogenesis and virulence of s. pneumoniae
 <cit> . however, to date, there is no report that provides a detailed characterization of tfs  and their activation patterns during pneumococcal translocation from the nasopharynx to deeper host tissues. the usual approach to address this problem involves the use of in silico analysis of promoter regions of differentially regulated genes and prediction of involved tfs, using the whole genomic sequence of a particular strain based on orthology . given the fact that functional specificity of proteins is conserved among orthologs  <cit> , it is possible to compare whole genomes of s. pneumoniae with escherichia coli to gain information on the tf and promoter activation map of pneumococcal virulence machinery.figure  <dig>

the study of activated domains of expressed proteins in addition to promoter activation profiles can result in a better understanding of functional genomics. compared to tfs, more information is available on pneumococcal pathogenesis at the level of expressed protein domains because of its use in vaccine design. the role of atp-dependent transport and dna binding domains in pneumococcal competence  <cit> , histidine kinase in sensing environmental cues and virulence  <cit> , and the role of psaa in virulence  <cit> , are well documented. genome wide analysis of histidine kinases and response regulators has led to the discovery of new response regulator loci  <cit> , while mutation in the dna gyrase domain has resulted in resistance to quinolones  <cit> .

in the present study, we used functional genomics tools to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms that underpin the different pathogenicity characteristics of  <dig> pneumococcal strains at both promoter  and domain  activation levels. to our knowledge, this combined approach of characterizing in vivo microarray data has not been reported previously and can be used as a model for unraveling functional genomics attributes of other pathogenic bacteria.

RESULTS
for the purposes of this investigation, we have used  <dig> well-characterised pneumococcal strains: d <dig> , wch <dig>  and wch <dig> . mouse intranasal challenge experiments have shown that d <dig> and wch <dig> are more virulent than wch <dig>  however, d <dig> causes severe pneumonia and high-grade bacteremia, while wch <dig> and wch <dig> have a propensity to translocate to the brain of infected mice  <cit>  . nevertheless, wch <dig> infection of mice demonstrates the “classical” disease progression from the nasopharynx to the lungs and dissemination to blood and then to the brain while wch <dig> seems to progress directly to the brain with minimal lung and blood involvement  <cit> . these striking differences in the pathogenicity and virulence characteristics of these strains make them ideal for comprehensive functional genomics analyses.

pneumococcal strains activate a variety of tfs during pathogenesis
our initial bioinformatic analysis of microarray data for d <dig>  wch <dig> and wch <dig> at 72 h post-infection of mice suggests that wch <dig> up-regulates many genes in the lungs and brain, wch <dig> up-regulates many genes in the brain, whereas d <dig> has significant genome activation in the blood. the list of up-regulated genes of d <dig>  wch <dig> and wch <dig> during pathogenesis is presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  4: tables s1-s <dig> 

we then characterized pneumococcal tfs capable of binding to a variety of up-regulated genes during pathogenesis and compared their activation profiles between d <dig>  wch <dig> and wch <dig>  generally, the highest differential tf activation profile could be observed in the blood . for d <dig>  a total of  <dig> transcription factor-binding sites  or regulatory elements were found, while this number dramatically fell to  <dig> for wch <dig> and just  <dig> for wch <dig> in the blood. in this niche, tfs with the highest number  of tfbs  were found in d <dig> . the potential tfbs for each of the tfs are listed in additional file 6: table s <dig>  the most active tf for all  <dig> strains in the blood was rpod, although its activation rate is markedly different between the strains . interestingly, a very high number of tfbs were associated with all these tfs  in wch <dig> and wch <dig> during brain infection. we also compared activated tfs between d <dig>  wch <dig> and wch <dig> during transition from the nasopharynx to the lungs. this revealed the same  <dig> activated tfs for wch <dig> and wch <dig>  while  <dig> were activated for d <dig>  of these, rpod was the most active tf for all  <dig> strains, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> binding sites on the promoter regions of up-regulated genes in wch <dig>  wch <dig> and d <dig>  respectively .table  <dig>

activated tfs with the highest number of tfbs cluster together
we sought to determine if there are any relationships or commonality between the activated tfs that we identified above in the  <dig> strains regarding their binding potential to the promoter regions of up-regulated genes during infection by hierarchical clustering analysis. interestingly, we found that all activated tfs harbouring the highest number of tfbs , except rpod, clustered together with a high level of similarity  in all  <dig> strains . these results were further validated by clvalid  <cit> , using internal and stability cluster validation measures to design a threshold line to generate  <dig> clusters. the threshold line shows that rpod has a distinct differential activation profile compared to the other tfs .figure  <dig>

we also compared the clustering profiles of all activated tfs across niches between the  <dig> strains. this showed that tfs that regulate the transition of wch <dig> and wch <dig> from the blood to the brain clustered together, with a very high level of similarity. moreover, the tfs that regulate translocation from the nasopharynx to the lungs clustered with those activated during transition from the blood to brain for both strains, albeit at a lower level . we also found that tfs that control transition from the nasopharynx to the lungs for d <dig>  and those responsible for transition from the lungs to blood for wch <dig> clustered together, while the tfs that regulated transition from lungs to blood in d <dig> were quite distinct. these clustering patterns were also validated by c1valid, and based on the  <dig> generated clusters after applying threshold line, blood vs lungs in strain d <dig> shows a distinct profile of activated tfs . these differences in tf activation profiles across niches are consistent with the bioluminescence patterns of the  <dig> strains in mice .figure  <dig>

activated tfs exhibit different behavior between pneumococcal strains
we used discriminant function analysis to compare the relative impact  of tfs between the  <dig> strains in various niches. comparison of d <dig> and wch <dig> showed that both strains have relatively similar discriminant models in the lungs. in the blood, a large number of tfs have opposite signs between d <dig> and wch <dig>  this highlights differential regulatory backgrounds of both strains in the blood . however, the discriminant modelling algorithm indicate that d <dig> and wch <dig> have similar regulatory backgrounds in the lungs but are different in the blood. the discriminant models of wch <dig> and wch <dig> in the lungs and brain show that the activated tfs have similar coefficient values and signs in both strains . interestingly, these strains choose different models during progression from lungs to blood. in this instance, of the  <dig> highly activated tfs, cody was the most significant predictor discriminating wch <dig> from wch <dig> in the blood, where its coefficient was - <dig> in wch <dig>  compared to + <dig> in wch <dig> 

given the predicted discriminant function for cody between these  <dig> strains, we hypothesized that a mutant of cody will show distinct pathogenic profiles between these strains in vivo. however, we noted that a previous manuscript reported that cody inactivation in d <dig> is difficult due to its essentiality  <cit>  and suggested further work in other clinical strains to establish if this is a general feature of pneumococci. therefore, we attempted to delete cody in d <dig>  wch <dig> and wch <dig> by targeted mutagenesis using the overlap extension strategy, as described in methods. surprisingly, we obtained putative mutants in all  <dig> strains, which were verified to be correct by pcr and sequencing using primers flanking the cody orf. we examined if the putative cody mutants carried the permissive amino acid  mutation in fatc  and/or amino acids  and amino acids 1– <dig> deletion mutations in amic  reported previously  <cit> . this was carried out by pcr and sequencing of the amic and fatc genes of  <dig> independent mutants from each of the  <dig> strains. however, we could not detect any of these reported changes. next, we tested the fitness of each of these putative cody mutants in an in vitro competition with the isogenic wild type over  <dig>  hrs. surprisingly, we found that the mutant of all  <dig> strains was completely out-competed by the wild type. output ratios were 1: <dig>  1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  for d39Δcody, wch16Δcody and wch43Δcody mutants, respectively at 3 h. we concluded that while the cody mutation might have been tolerated in these strains, the mutation is unstable, in agreement with the finding of caymaris and colleagues regarding the essentiality of cody  <cit> . we also found that during in vitro growth, the antibiotic resistance selection marker in the cody mutant strains is lost in the absence of selection. this was verified by replica-plating cells grown on antibiotic plates onto plates with or without antibiotic; the relative rate of loss of selection was more rapid in the wch16Δcody , compared to 1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> , for the wch43Δcody and d39Δcody putative mutants, respectively.

as a consequence of these findings, we explored an alternative approach to investigating the discriminant function of cody in the  <dig> strains. we placed cody under the expression of ami promoter and transformed this into the  <dig> strains, generating d39ind, wch16ind, and d39ind, respectively. next, we tested the fitness of these codyind strains in an in vitro competition experiment with their otherwise isogenic wild-type derivatives over  <dig>  hrs. in this model, there was no difference in bacterial counts of the codyind strains compared to their isogenic wild-type counterparts at any of the time points tested . we then investigated the effect of over-expressing cody on the in vivo fitness of the codyind strains relative to their respective wild type counterparts in a mouse intranasal  competition experiment over a 36 h period, as described in methods. our analysis shows that there was no significant difference in the ability of the d39ind strain to colonise the nasopharynx or invade the lungs, blood or brain . however, the wch16ind strain was massively out-competed by its wild-type counterpart in all these niches . interestingly, the wch43ind strain was only out-competed by the isogenic wild-type strain in its ability to invade the bloodstream and brain . together, these analyses confirm the bioinformatics prediction of the discriminant function of cody in wch <dig>  consistent with its role in controlling the expression of many genes involved in pneumococcal metabolism and virulence  <cit> .figure  <dig>

up-regulated genes are predicted to be co-regulated by similar sets of tfs in various niches
we then attempted to identify genes  that are co-regulated by the same  <dig> highly activated tfs in the lungs, blood or brain. this allowed us to construct a series of tf activation networks for the  <dig> strains . overall, our results show that the same groups of genes were co-regulated by similar sets of tfs in the lungs and brains of mice infected with wch <dig>  and in the brains of mice infected with wch <dig>  these results correlate with the tf activation profiles observed for these strains in those niches . interestingly, only sp_ <dig> , and sp_ <dig>  were found to be potentially co-regulated by argr, hup, rpod and rr <dig>  we also observed that d <dig> showed a distinct set and high number of up-regulated genes in the blood. the majority of these genes are co-regulated by  <dig> tfs, except for a set of genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway  that are co-regulated by all but one  of the  <dig> highly activated tfs . a view of the genome maps of sequenced s. pneumoniae strains suggests these genes are grouped in transcriptional units, although the sequence of sp_ <dig> is very short  and is absent in most of these strains . search for orthologous genes and clustering analysis also shows a high level of identity and conservation for sp_0317-sp_ <dig> in other streptococci  and in bacillus subtilis. these results are reminiscent of redundancy of tf–tfb interactions as described for overlapping regulons like soxs, mara and rob of e. coli
 <cit> , and among prfa/ctsr/hrca and alternative sigma factors  of listeria monocytogenes
 <cit>  and among the ςx and ςw regulon in b. subtilis
 <cit>  in which different sites are able to recruit the same tf, while different tfs can recognize similar sites.figure  <dig>

our analysis also included the identification of genes that are commonly up-regulated by each of the  <dig> highly activated tfs in the lungs, blood or brain for the  <dig> strains. we restricted our analysis to include the genes that harbor a minimum of  <dig> tfbs in their promoter regions in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> strains. this showed that the same set of genes  are commonly up-regulated in the lungs and brain for wch <dig> and wch <dig> . however, these genes were not detected during lung infection by d <dig>  by contrast, only one gene , a putative n-acetylneuraminate lyase, was up-regulated in wch <dig> and d <dig> in the blood. these results are complementary to data presented in additional file 8: table s <dig> 

genes harboring higher numbers of regulatory elements constitute a novel index of quality-based gene selection
we developed a new quality-based selection index based on mining of the number of regulatory elements on the promoter regions of up-regulated genes controlled by the  <dig> highly activated tfs. specifically, we hypothesized that genes containing higher numbers of tfbs are likely to play key roles in pneumococcal pathogenesis because of their ability to host more tfs. of the up-regulated genes during infection of lungs and brain by wch <dig> and wch <dig>  sp_ <dig>  was predicted to contain the highest number of tfbs  in its promoter region . in the blood, wch <dig> up-regulates sp_ <dig>  with  <dig> tfbs in its promoter region. however, in d <dig>  sp_ <dig> and sp_ <dig> , sp_ <dig> and sp_ <dig> , and sp_ <dig>   were up-regulated.

go analysis of up-regulated genes containing higher number of tfbs in lungs vs nasopharynx suggests that these genes are involved in key metabolic processes such as nadph activity, fatty acid biosynthetic process, sugar phosphotransferase system, membrane development, nad binding, and proteolysis. these processes are important during colonization of the nasopharynx and translocation to lungs by s. pneumoniae. in the blood vs lungs comparisons, genes containing high number of tfbs enrich go processes of ion binding , transporter activity, metabolic process, as well as ion transmembrane transport. these processes are vital for survival of s. pneumoniae in the blood, highlighting the important roles of such up-regulated genes with high tfbs in their promoter regions in the blood. go analysis of up-regulated genes with high tfbs in the brain vs blood comparison were found to be involved in important processes such as nadph activity, sugar:hydrogen symporter activity, glutamine biosynthetic process, fatty acid biosynthetic process, sugar phosphotransferase activity, kinase activity, carbohydrate transmembrane transport, ion transmembrane transport, and nad binding. these processes facilitate the translocation, survival and adaptation of wch <dig> and wch <dig> in the brain.

domain activation profiles of different pneumococcal strains during pathogenesis
we reasoned that the study of activated domains of expressed proteins in addition to promoter activation profiles could result in a better understanding of functional genomics because of its use in vaccine design. therefore, we predicted the complete domain activation catalogue of wch <dig>  wch <dig> and d <dig> during infection of various host tissues. accordingly, wch <dig>  is predicted to have the highest amount of its domain activation in the lungs, with  <dig> predicted domains, compared to  <dig> for d <dig> and  <dig> for wch <dig> . our analysis also suggests that wch <dig> has relatively low activation in the blood, with only one predicted activated domain . in comparison, wch <dig> is predicted to activate  <dig> domains in the blood, while d <dig> is predicted to exhibit the most remarkable profile, activating  <dig> possible domains in the blood. it is also predicted that energy producing domains such as atpase family associated, atp-synt_ab_n  and abc transporters are used by d <dig> to maintain fulminant bacteremia .table  <dig>

strains during movement from the nasopharynx → lungs → blood → brain




comparison of the activated domain profiles of wch <dig> and wch <dig> in the brain revealed that the number of activated domains for both strains are essentially similar . the only slight difference is that in wch <dig> more activated domains including energy-producing , two-component regulatory system, trna, ribosomal and pts systems domains were found.

discussion
in this work, we have used a functional genomics-based approach to provide a comprehensive prediction of tf activation profiles and domain expression patterns of  <dig> different s. pneumoniae strains during pathogenesis. it has been suggested that the tf and promoter activation map of an organism can be obtained by comparison with the fully annotated map of an ortholog  given the fact that functional specificity of proteins is conserved among orthologs  <cit> . therefore, we exploited the available e. coli transcriptional regulation data to gain information on the orthologous tf and promoter activation map of 3 s. pneumoniae strains  during pathogenesis. however, it has been argued that such methods have shortcomings when applied to distantly related organisms  <cit> . we attempted to address this potential drawback by using an approach that predicts the function of genes based on the similarity/difference in the pattern of tfbs. the identified potential tfbs and their organization modules provide another way to understand gene expression and regulation during pathogenesis. taking into account these approaches, we present a strategy for selection of novel antibacterial targets and vaccine candidates.

in a recent investigation  <cit> , we introduced the concept of bacterial niche-specific virulence gene expression during pathogenesis by qualitative comparisons of transcriptomic data of one niche versus the previous niche. in the present study, we carried out an in-depth analysis of the tf-regulatory network that govern this transition in order to shed light on the virulence factors that s. pneumoniae employs to breach host tissue barriers. our analysis showed that  <dig> tfs  were highly activated in all  <dig> strains in vivo and were capable of binding to a large number of up-regulated genes. we suggest that these tfs might constitute the regulatory backbone that underpins pneumococcal pathogenesis. we also found that these tfs were used by d <dig> in blood and by wch <dig> and wch <dig> during brain infection.

a close examination of activated tfs of the  <dig> strains suggests that s. pneumoniae adapts to each host niche during infection by increasing the number of tfs deployed . as a corollary, the number of activated tfs is reduced if the bacteria are unable to adapt to a particular niche . not surprisingly, rpod was the most active tf for all  <dig> strains in all niches, consistent with its role in promoting the attachment of rna polymerase to specific initiation sites during transcription. the observed similarity between the predicted tf activation profiles and their clustering patterns between distinct niches suggests that different s. pneumoniae strains might activate the same set of tfs and regulatory elements at different sites of infection. this is further supported by discriminant function analysis of the tfs in various niches, which highlights differential regulatory backgrounds of the  <dig> strains in the blood. we also provide experimental evidence that validates the predicted discriminant function for cody between the  <dig> strains by showing distinct pathogenic profiles of their otherwise isogenic cody induced derivatives in various anatomical niches of mice. the results are consistent with our in vivo microarray and real-time rt-pcr data showing differential expression of cody-regulated virulence genes such as alia, ilvh and piua in various niches of mice  <cit> , and are also in agreement with results from other workers  <cit> . furthermore, the predicted domain activation catalogues of these strains during pathogenesis suggests that their functional domain profiles differed mainly in the blood, with only one domain  activated for wch <dig>   <dig> for wch <dig> and  <dig> domains for d <dig>  these results are consistent with gene ontology classifications for wch <dig> and wch <dig>  <cit> , and in agreement with our published observations showing that these  <dig> strains display distinct pathogenicity characteristics  <cit> .

our analyses also showed that some genes could potentially be regulated by multiple tfs. for example, sp_ <dig>  was predicted to be regulated by argr, hup, rpod and rr <dig> in the lungs of d39-infected mice. notably, this gene has recently been characterized to have a role in pneumococcal attachment and internalization in host epithelial  and endothelial  cell lines  <cit> . we also developed a new quality-based strategy for selection of genes important for pathogenesis, based on mining of the number of tfbs in their promoter regions. go analysis of such genes allowed us to propose that number of tfbs in the promoter regions of up-regulated genes is an important and novel index for selection of genes that play key roles at distinct stages of pneumococcal pathogenesis. in this context, we found, amongst other genes, a group of class iic bacteriocins that harbor the highest number of tfbs in wch <dig> and d <dig> harvested from the blood. bacteriocins have been shown to be involved in fratricide in s. pneumoniae, a phenomenon that favors natural competence and pathogenesis in this organism  <cit> . additionally, a putative n-acetylneuraminate lyase  was up-regulated by both wch <dig> and d <dig> in blood, suggesting a need for this enzyme for metabolic adaptation of these strains in this niche.

it has been suggested that regulation of pneumococcal virulence proteins is very complex and multifactorial, and likely involves overlapping regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . we found that all the highly activated tfs argr, cody, hup, rr <dig>  scrr and smrc), except rpod, clustered together in all  <dig> strains. this is a significant finding, implying redundancy in the regulatory roles of these tfs during infection, as the functions of these tfs in pathogenesis and regulation of virulence gene expression have hitherto been studied in isolation . indeed, this notion is exemplified by our recent work, which showed that a defined mutation of smrc in a wch <dig> background did not completely abrogate virulence  <cit> . in the same context, we showed in figure  <dig> that the same groups of up-regulated genes are predicted to be co-regulated by similar sets of tfs. these findings might explain a fundamental problem associated with prevention and control of pneumococcal disease, as it appears that the task of identifying the principal targets of intervention would be challenging. therefore, a thorough analysis of the important regulatory pathways employed by s. pneumoniae in different in vivo niches would likely improve our knowledge of pneumococcal pathogenesis and identify novel targets for intervention.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest a possible evolutionary strategy for the pneumococcus in which the evolution occurs in non-coding promoter regions of genes during infection. specifically, the pneumococcus changes the short binding sites in the promoter regions of genes instead of alteration of coding sequences in a niche-specific manner to generate more virulent strains. there are two important caveats of this study. firstly, we utilized the fully annotated e. coli promoter listings to pull out the orthologous tfs in s. pneumoniae, which might not represent the full array of active promoters in the pneumococcus. secondly, the microarray slides used in this study cannot detect the expression of unique wch16-specific genes that are absent in tigr <dig> and r <dig> genomes represented on the slides. nevertheless, this study is the first such investigation; it provides a framework towards a better understanding of the dynamics of pneumococcal pathogenesis, and opens new avenues into similar investigations in other pathogenic bacteria.
