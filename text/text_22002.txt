BACKGROUND
the functional unit of the liver, the lobule, is roughly cylindrical, with branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein together with bile ducts at its periphery, and a central vein branch in the middle. such a structure allows a natural distinction between upstream "periportal" and downstream "perivenous" hepatocytes, and constitutes the basis for "liver zonation". it is generally accepted that the homeostatic function of the liver depends on the functional complementation of those two zones  <cit> . different, or even opposite, metabolic functions are often found between periportal and perivenous hepatocytes  <cit> . that heterogeneity is important for understanding of various aspects of liver function and pathology  <cit> , and is widely studied  <cit> . however, little attention has been paid so far to zonation-like alterations associated with human hepatocellular carcinoma , which is one of the most frequent visceral neoplasms worldwide  <cit> .

accumulating evidence indicates that wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a central role in the multi-level regulation of zonal gene expression in the liver  <cit> . it is also implicated in several critical pathways responsible for initiating and maintaining dysregulated cell proliferation in hcc  <cit> . a key factor in the wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway is the success or failure of proteasomal degradation of the cytosol β-catenin. migration of accumulated β-catenin to the nucleus subsequently induces the synthesis of several tumor promoters. in normal physiological conditions, β-catenin activation is restricted to perivenous hepatocytes  <cit> , where it both induces "perivenous" gene expression and inhibits "periportal" gene expression  <cit> . genetic therapy of hcc faces severe challenges, since hcc involves genetic alterations of multiple genes in several regulatory pathways simultaneously  <cit> . understanding the relationships between the zonation of these pathways in the liver may deepen our views on the pathogenesis of hcc, its proliferation or maintenance.

the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a highly conserved eukaryotic system for cellular protein degradation, is important for cancer cells to block apoptosis or other normal cellular processes  <cit> . the levels of proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and in membranes, are all kept in check by the ubiquitination enzymes and the proteasome  <cit> . a variety of healthy or diseased cell functions are affected by this regulatory mechanism. the corresponding signaling cascade includes the ubiquitin-activating enzyme e <dig>  ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes e <dig> and a highly diverse class of ubiquitin ligases e <dig>  the wide variety of e <dig> ligases, mainly including the ring-, scf-, hect- and u-box-types, target a tremendous number of proteins for ubiquitination. for example, c-cbl e <dig> ligase ubiquitinates several receptor protein-tyrosine kinases  <cit> . alterations in protein ubiquitination, such as modified affinity of a signaling receptor for e <dig> enzymes after phosphorylation of its intracellular domain, lead to dysregulated signaling, promotion of cancer cells' growth and their withstanding of anti-proliferative and cell death stimuli  <cit> .

with the increasing availability of transcriptomic and proteomic data, pathway analysis has become a significant avenue to uncover the structure of functional/regulatory networks in tumoral or normal tissues. pathway-based analyses are usually based on an assessment of correlations in genes or proteins expressions. various algorithms, such as gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  and structural information based pathway analysis  <cit> , have been developed to identify biologically relevant pathways. those methods may take advantage of information previously gathered in databases such as kegg  or biocarta to improve statistical power. a pathway approach has been able, for example, to identify a coordinated decrease in the expression of functional signals in human diabetes  <cit> .

meanwhile, technological advances in liver tissue engineering and biomechanics allow in vitro studies with much tighter control of extraneous conditions. numerous in vitro hepatocyte models have been proposed  <cit> . hepatocyte cultures are one of the most successful in vitro systems, since liver-specific functions and response to stressors can be maintained with appropriate culture conditions  <cit> . the major problems can be limited viability, associated with the loss of phase i and phase ii biotransformation capacity  <cit> . "biochips" grow cells in a microfluidic network, allowing a better control of dynamic cultures by continuous feeding of nutrients to cells and waste removal  <cit> . previous transcriptomic analyses of hepatocyte function in dynamic biochips showed that phase i and phase ii enzymes were significantly up-regulated and xenobiotic metabolism maintained  <cit> .

in this study, we carried out an extensive gsea pathway analysis of gene and protein expression data from hcc cells grown in either microfluidic biochips  or petri dishes , representing dynamic and static micro-environments, respectively. on the basis of these analyses, we investigated the relationship between activated pathways, experimental rt-qpcr data, and daily hepatocytes' metabolic activities  <cit> , in the framework of hepatic zonation. finally, the distinct effects of matched protein expression data in the two groups led us to investigate the role of ubiquitination in the onset of oncogenic properties.

RESULTS
different categories of pathways are activated in μfb and pd
we performed gsea  <cit>  of gene transcription and protein expression data obtained in human hcc cell lines cultured in μfb and pd. gene expression data were used alone or in combination with matched protein expression data. the pathways definitions used were those of the kegg database. table  <dig> categorizes the gene sets differentially expressed in the μfb and pd groups with a false discovery rate  ≤  <dig>  . the number of pathways found and their specificities were quite different between the two culture conditions. a pronounced metabolism-pathways profile was found in μfb, while a signaling-pathways profile  dominated in pd . that result is supported by the observation that, compared to other kegg pathway categories, signaling and regular metabolic pathways have a general tendency to lose their gene expression coherence in tumor cells  <cit> . typical liver-function-specific pathways  and cancer-related pathways  were significantly activated in the μfb and pd groups, respectively. the result on metabolic pathways in μfb is supported by  <cit> , and indicates that μfb cultures represent a 3d culture condition yielding metabolically competent cells, closer in phenotype to primary human hepatocytes  <cit> . among the metabolic pathways activated in μfb, only one out of  <dig> concerned energy metabolism , which has been shown to be mostly periportal  <cit>  . only nitrogen energy metabolism was activated in pd . genetic information processing pathways, which are highly correlated with genomic alterations in hcc  <cit> , were the second most activated in μfb while the corresponding information was lost in pd . previous experiments in mice liver lobules suggest that the perivenous genetic program is switched off, and the periportal program switched on, by a wnt inhibitor or by lowered expression of β-catenin  <cit> . using the same gene expression data, there were  <dig> pathways with an fdr ≈  <dig> in μfb  and only one in pd: "maturity onset of diabetes of the young", a monogenic form of type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> , which is in agreement with our cell model.

a results using gene expression data only/results using gene and protein expression data.

results with and without protein data included were not very different, due to the much lower number of identified relevant proteins. however, close examination showed that the effects of protein data inclusion were quite opposite in the μfb and pd groups: in μfb, the total number of pathways was reduced, although new pathways such as rig-i-like receptor signaling were activated; in pd, an increased number of pathways were identified .

hcc-related cyps and kinases represent the cancer phenotypes in μfb and pd, respectively
we proceeded to assess whether one of the above identified pathways offered a clear separation of the hcc phenotypes in μfb and pd. that is especially useful for manually curated gene sets like kegg pathways, which may represent amalgamated processes  <cit> . gsea was used to examine, at the gene level, the leading-edge pathways identified above. table  <dig> presents the top genes participating to at least four pathways identified using both gene and protein expression data . eleven and  <dig> genes are included in the μfb and pd, respectively. overall, there is notably more gene sharing in the top  <dig> pd pathways than in the top  <dig> μfb pathways, indicating a high density of pathway cross talk in pd, consistent with the least cohesive property of signaling pathways  <cit> . yet, in both groups, many genes belong to a common gene family. in μfb cultures, four  out of  <dig> genes are the members of cytochrome p <dig> superfamily. hcc has effects on the expression of cyp1a and cyp3a genes  <cit> . in particular, cyp3a <dig> shows a notable increase in gene copies and mrna transcripts in hcc cell lines from eight ethnically diverse human populations  <cit> . in pd cultures, twelve of the genes found , out of  <dig>  are manifested in hepato-carcinogenesis  <cit> . they belong to kinases and proteins having kinase activities, growth factors and transcription factors playing critical roles in hcc, and several of them are targets of drug currently tried for hcc treatment.

periportal- and perivenous-like pathways characterize μfb and pd, respectively
although specific liver functions and hcc signals are more or less expressed in the two groups, the overall μfb and pd cellular phenotypes are quite different. previous studies indicate that the loss or gain of β-catenin signaling has important consequences; in the former case, liver cells acquire a periportal-like phenotype  <cit> . we thus postulated that the pathways patterns observed in the μfb and pd groups could be interpreted as the result of loss or over-activation of the β-catenin pathway, respectively. that was hinted at by the elevated expression levels of periportal-like and perivenous-like markers in the above gsea results, but also in previously published rt-qpcr and metabolic activity data  <cit> .

under normal conditions, the expression of cytochromes p <dig> is mostly restricted to perivenous hepatocytes and under β-catenin regulation. the hypothesis that β-catenin signaling is localized in the perivenous area has been well described  <cit> . evidence has been recently provided that, in β-catenin knockout mice, cyp1a and cyp3a expression is strongly altered  <cit> : high cyp3a mrna and protein levels are observed in periportal hepatocytes, while cyp1a induction by ahr agonists occurred uniformly in all hepatocytes. in rat liver, low doses of β-naphtoflavone lead to cyp1a <dig> induction in periportal hepatocytes  <cit> . on the other hand, cyp3a zonation is completely lost in human hcc  <cit> .

in the above gsea analyses, only the cyp1a and 3a families  were found in the top-ranking pathways for μfb cultures . similarly, rt-qpcr has shown up-regulation of cyp1a <dig>  1a <dig>  3a <dig>  3a <dig> and 3a <dig>  with a slight induction of ahr transcription  and pxr transcription  in μfb cultures, compared to pd cultures  <cit> .

to visualize β-catenin signaling expression in pd cultures, the kegg wnt signaling pathway was drawn by paintomics  <cit>  on the basis of the pd gene expression data . over-expressed genes dominate the painted wnt signaling pathway, with dense connections between wnt signaling and the pathways governing focal adhesion, mapk, tgf-β and calcium signaling pathways, all activated in pd cultures. other relevant expressions in pd cultures are the nitrogen metabolism pathway, controlled by β-catenin  <cit> , and the egfr gene, which enhances β-catenin transcriptional activity  <cit> . furthermore, five genes, each of which participates in the overlapping four pathways in pd cultures, are involved in the wnt signaling pathway  . these genes might constitute the specific induction of wnt signaling in hepg2/c3a cells  although myc is normally not induced by β-catenin signaling in the adult liver  <cit> . the absence of cyps in hepg2/c3a pd cultures is consistent with the overall repressive effect of ras-raf-mapk signaling on expression of cyp enzymes  <cit> .

differences in glutamine-related ammonia detoxification between μfb and pd cultures also maps to the spatial heterogeneity of hepatocytes in vivo. periportal glutaminase and perivenous glutamine synthetase genes are respectively negatively and positively controlled by β-catenin  <cit>  . therefore, the net glutamine balance across the liver, involving periportal consumption and perivenous glutamine synthesis, can be either positive, negative or zero, depending on experimental conditions  <cit> . glutamine consumption was found to be higher in μfb than in pd cultures, especially after  <dig> h  <cit>  . dynamic flow conditions in microfluidic bioreactors lead to increased glutamine consumption and ammonia production, compared to static bioreactor conditions or petri dishes  <cit> . glutaminase activity might therefore be more active in μfb as it is in the periportal area, while glutamine synthetase activity should dominate in pd, like in perivenous hepatocytes.

taken together, those results suggest that the periportal- and perivenous-like pathways are differentially activated in dynamic μfb and static pd, respectively .

distinct ubiquitin-mediated regulations in μfb and pd cultured cancer cells
as mentioned above, including protein expression data in the initial gsea had distinct effects on pathway inference for μfb and pd cultures . that suggests that the coordination of gene and protein expressions is somewhat different in the two culture types. post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as protein degradation, are among the possible explanations for that observation. we thus explored a possible role of ubiquitination in leading to the observed cell phenotypes  and gsea results.

in μfb cultures, there appears to be a loss of β-catenin pathway activity, which might correlate to the activated "proteasomal"  digestion of β-catenin. that degradation has been shown to be dependent on the shuttling of apc  <cit>  . the loss of β-catenin regulation might favor the activation of genetic pathways over signaling pathways. almost 50% of the top genes differentially expressed in μfb cultures   are involved in chromosomal dna replication. proteomic analysis showed an elevated protein expression of dna repair  in μfb cultures. in addition, increasing evidence links proteasome function with chaperones  <cit> . an observed over-expression of hsp90aa <dig> and ab <dig> proteins might be in response to the degradation of cyp2e <dig>  <cit> . gsea excluded cyp2e <dig> from the list of enriched genes in the "metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450" and "drug metabolism cytochrome p450" pathways . that result is in accordance with the hcc database  <cit>  which shows that almost half of the specimens of cyp2e <dig> are either up- or down-regulated in a ratio of  <dig> to  <dig>  overall, in μfb cultured hcc cells, a high degree of genetic instability seems to facilitate the inactivation of normal and tumor suppressor proteins as well as the activation of hcc-related proteins like cyp1a and cyp3a.

in pd cultures, e <dig> ubiquitin ligases rnf <dig> and rnf <dig>  cathepsins b, c and d, all of which are involved in the ubiquitination system, had significantly elevated expression . they may play a major role in directing the signaling proteins singled out by gsea to ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation . for instance, it has been clearly shown that the ring finger ligase can be recruited by egfr for subsequent routing to lysosomal degradation  <cit> . yet, in most cases, ubiquitinated egfr activates the internalization and is not targeted by the proteasome  <cit> . the altered proteolytic machinery may imply an ubiquitin modulation of egfr, which could be associated with distinct stages in the transition to the active kinase forms of egfr  <cit> . that may serve as a temporal/spatial control of egf signaling, which finely regulates pathways related to survival, proliferation and angiogenesis. similarly, the receptor tyrosine kinase pdgfra, together with its ligand, participates to these pathways and is a substrate of c-cbl e <dig> ubiquitin ligase  <cit> . the tgf-β ligand itself plays an important role in cancer progression by functioning both as an anti-proliferative factor and as a tumor promoter  <cit> , and the ubiquitin-proteasome system is known to regulate the core intracellular signaling cascade smad proteins  <cit> . therefore, in contrast to the μfb culture phenotype which may result from genetic alterations, the pd cultured hcc cell phenotype could be influenced by an altered ubiquitination of signaling proteins.

discussion
the emerging consensus on hepatic zonation is that it spatially separates pathways to avoid interference and energy wastage  <cit> . this notion is compatible with our proposed parallel between zonation profiles and culture types: upstream hepatocytes, as in biochips cultures, exhibit broad metabolic and genetic profiles; downstream hepatocytes, as in plates, display mainly signaling and disease processes.

previous studies have pointed to several limitations of hepg <dig> hepatocytes: a repression of various cyp isoforms by the egf/ras/mapk signaling transduction pathway  <cit> ; the development of a periportal genetic program, allowed by inhibition of wnt signaling  <cit> ; the absence of a urea cycle, leading to ammonia detoxification only via glutamine synthesis  <cit> . the first two limitations are clearly culture-type dependent, as shown by our analysis of μfb and pd culture conditions. as for the third limitation, our study indicates that favoring a periportal-like phenotype in μfb cultured hepatocytes might improve urea synthesis in hepg <dig> cells. we assert that the causes of these limitations are linked to the β-catenin pathway. that, however, remains to be experimentally confirmed, because other regulatory pathways might be involved as well. it would be especially interesting, for example, to study wild-type ctnnb <dig> hepatoma cells which express β-catenin and metabolic enzymes at levels even closer to the in vivo situation.

it is interesting to note that hcc-related cyps were activated in μfb cultures, where a deficit in signaling pathways was observed. on the other hand, protein kinases were activated in pd cultures, with a serious deficit in metabolic pathways. it seems reasonable to assume that both pathway categories need to be balanced, and that imbalance leads to homeostasis abnormalities. that is important because much efforts are devoted to developing kinases and signaling pathways inhibitors for therapeutic intervention. the results presented here indicate that in such conditions, cancer cells may spontaneously develop metabolism-mediated resistance. in that case, it might be worth to mitigate inhibition of the active form of kinases, or to target inactive kinase conformations . the initial stage of inactivation of a typical cancer-related kinase  has been recently described  <cit> .

protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination go hand in hand in the regulation of many cellular processes, and phosphorylation typically precedes ubiquitination  <cit> . it is commonly thought that the loss of apoptosis is required for carcinogenesis, and that cancer cells aim to develop survival and growth. however, different environmental changes, which can be related to personalized medicine, can significantly modulate the cells responses such as the genetic alteration coupled with proteasomal degradation and apoptosis in μfb cultured hcc cells, and signaling alteration in pd cultures. moreover, the fact that ubiquitinated egfr is in most cases not targeted to the proteasome may indicate that signaling pathways remain functional despite the ubiquitination of their proteins, but this remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper describes links between β-catenin controlled hepatic zonation and the phenotype of hepg <dig> cells grown in dynamic μfb cultures or static pd conditions, on the basis of gene and protein expression data. cyp1a/3a and kinases are representative of the cancer phenotypes in μfb and pd, respectively. plausible ubiquitin-mediated regulation mechanisms are proposed for β-catenin degradation in μfb, and ubiquitin alteration of signaling proteins in pd.
