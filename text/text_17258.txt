BACKGROUND
cis-natural antisense transcripts  are endogenous rna molecules that are transcribed from the opposite dna strand of the same genomic locus and overlap partly with sense rna by convergent or divergent orientation. it has been clearly demonstrated that cis-nats are an important biogenesis mechanism to generate endogenous short interfering rnas  known as ‘natural antisense sirnas’   <cit> . numerous evidence indicates that nats use diverse transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms to carry out different biological roles  <cit> , including rna interference  <cit> , gene silencing  <cit> , rna masking-induced alternative splicing  <cit>  and rna editing  <cit> .

since a large number of natural antisense transcripts were first identified to be widespread in the human genome  <cit> , computational analysis of data generated from large-scale sequencing projects has been widely used to globally identify cis-nats in various eukaryotic organisms. common techniques and databases, including in silico analyses of expressed sequence tag  databases  <cit> , genomic annotation of large transcript sets  <cit> , large-scale sequencing of full-length complementary dnas   <cit>  and tiling arrays  <cit> , have been applied to identify nats. recently, more efforts were made to characterize nat-sirnas and nats at a genome-wide level: massively parallel signature sequencing  data  <cit> , combining pyrophosphate-based high-throughput sequencing and computational analyses of genomic annotation datasets  <cit>  and asymmetric strand-specific analysis of gene expression   <cit> . it has been reported that about 5-70% in mammals and 7-9% in plants of all transcripts are overlapped as cis-nats. these studies have demonstrated four major characteristics of cis-nats.  both cis-nat pairs can encode proteins or be non-protein-coding transcripts. in the mammalian genome, a non-protein-coding antisense rna partner of a protein-coding transcript is considered the most prominent form  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ~88% of the sense-antisense transcripts  were shown to be pairs of protein-coding genes  and non-protein-coding rnas from non-agi transcriptional units  <cit> ; however, it has been reported that > 86% of rice bidirectional transcript pairs included a coding sequence in both strands  <cit> .  the distribution of antisense transcripts in mammals was found to be non-random across the genome  <cit> .  expression levels of sense and antisense transcripts can be either positively or negatively correlated  <cit> .  in arabidopsis, most of the cis-nats are arranged in convergent orientation. several genes were found to be involved in two cis-nats as a network: one pair is convergent, another is divergent  <cit> .

however, there are still some limitations to comprehensively identifying cis-nats. firstly, the percentage of cis-nats in different eukaryotic genomes, especially in plants, is estimated mainly by the alignment of full-length cdnas, ests and predicted coding sequences to the genome. the transcriptomes are still not sequenced deeply enough to provide all transcripts, including low copy number and non-coding rnas . secondly, as important evidence to determine the regulation of cis-nats by rna interference, nat-sirnas are still far from saturated, despite many efforts in plants  in recent years  <cit> . thirdly, it is also essential to accurately quantify the expression levels of sense and antisense transcripts at a global level.

the advent of second-generation sequencing technology enables deep sequencing of transcripts. the paired-end tag sequencing strategy of strand-specific cdna sequencing technology  has the potential to globally produce abundant and novel transcripts with clear polarity and to accurately assess gene activity  <cit> . moreover, each cell type has its unique transcriptome, so a single-cell-level description of gene expression and regulation can be instructive concerning cell populations  <cit> . the latest rna-seq applied to single cells gives more precise transcriptome quantifications than a pcr-based amplification method  <cit> . meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing techniques have made it feasible to obtain all small rnas species, genome-wide, as it can generate hundreds of millions reads in a single sequencing run.

here, we took advantage of ssrna-seq technology to deeply sequence cdnas with clear transcriptional orientations in the model plant species rice . all mrnas were derived from seedlings grown under normal  and abiotic stressed conditions for assessing rice cis-nats at the best possible resolution. we also deeply sequenced small rnas to investigate nat-sirnas from rice seedlings under normal and several stresses conditions. in addition, we tried to sequence transcriptome of rice leaf epidermal cells and evaluate the expression of cis-nats identified in this research. we identified  <dig> rice cis-nats with both evidence of gene expression and nat-sirnas from their overlapping regions. about  <dig> % of them were shown to be simultaneously expressed in epidermal cells. some cis-nats gave rise to nat-sirnas exclusively in the overlap regions, and some cis-nats seemed to be expressed under specific abiotic stress conditions. this study was the first attempt of applying ssrna-seq to deeply investigate novel transcripts and revealed widespread occurrence of cis-nats in rice.

RESULTS
ssrna-seq and assembly of rice transcripts
in order to comprehensively identify rice cis-nats, we applied ssrna-seq to deeply sequence rice cdnas for assessing transcripts with clear transcriptional orientations. rice seedlings grown under normal and three abiotic stress conditions  were collected for preparations of mrna and small rnas , and four strand-specific cdna libraries were then constructed according to the empirical protocol  <cit> . in general, a modified rna-seq method is used for incorporation of deoxy-utp during second-strand cdna synthesis and subsequent destruction of the uridine-containing strand in the sequencing library. this enables the identification of transcript orientation. the high-throughput sequencing of strand-specific cdnas was performed on the illumina gaiix. in total,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million paired-end reads of  <dig> ×  <dig> bp with high-quality, which were generated from the untreated and salt, cold and drought stress treatments libraries, respectively, matched unambiguously and uniquely to the rice reference genome  <cit>  . we estimated the accuracy of transcriptional orientation by comparing the sequencing reads with the annotated gene datasets  <cit> . about  <dig> - <dig> % of the mapped reads appeared to be aligned with correct transcriptional orientation, providing strong evidence for ssrna-seq data in a strand-specific manner. in contrast to ssrna-seq data, only half of the mapped reads from the previous rna-seq data were consistent with the gene models at the same transcriptional orientations. in addition, we also deeply sequenced epidermal cells of normal rice seedlings, and about  <dig>  million paired-end reads of  <dig> ×  <dig> bp were generated as high-quality data.

using the software tophat and cufflinks  <cit> , we assembled ssrna-seq data combined with the rice genome annotation  <cit>  into  <dig>  transcripts corresponding to  <dig>  unique gene loci . of them,  <dig>  were identified as novel transcripts, which were composed of  <dig> ncrna,  <dig>  cds with protein hits and  <dig> cds without any protein hits .

identification of putative cis-nats in rice
based on renewed assembled transcripts, we identified putative cis-nats which overlapped, but were opposite, from the same or adjacent gene locus. in total,  <dig> pairs of rice cis-nats  were preliminarily screened out. after excluding those in which either of the pairs encoded a transposon, rrna, trna, snrna, snorna or mirna, we obtained  <dig> putative cis-nats with mean overlapped length of  <dig> nt . according to the directions of the involved transcripts,  <dig>  cis-nats were categorized in enclosed,  <dig>  in convergent , and  <dig>  in divergent  orientations. of rice cis-nats,  <dig> %  were pairs of protein-coding genes and non-protein-coding rnas . another  <dig> %  were a pfam domain-containing transcript partner of a predicted cds without any pfam domain. in general, the majority of cis-nats  were one-to-one type, i.e. one transcript in a cis-nat pair had only one antisense partner. the remaining  <dig> cis-nats  were involved in networks of  <dig> cis-nat groups.

small rnas and nat-sirnas in rice
to investigate the complexity of small rnas in rice, we generated four small rna libraries from rice seedlings under normal conditions and three abiotic stress treatments , and deeply sequenced the libraries on the illumina gaiix. the small rna libraries were made with an rna ligation method which produces strand-specific libraries. after removing low-quality reads and those mapped to rrna, trna, sn/snorna, mitochondria and chloroplasts,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> distinct small rnas  from corresponding untreated, salt, cold and drought conditions, were identified . small rnas of 24-nt were the predominant size class . we found that the majority were located in transposon-related regions, followed by upstream, intergenic, downstream, and intron regions .

to determine the amount of nat-sirnas, we searched in the four small rna libraries that matched uniquely and perfectly to the overlapping regions of the  <dig> cis-nats. a total of  <dig>  reads corresponding to  <dig>  unique small rnas  were derived from overlapped regions . here, nat-sirnas showed wide ranges in size of 18- <dig> nt, with 21- <dig> nt the most common size . the 5′-first nucleotide of nat-sirnas was predominantly adenosine , which differed from that of the total small rnas .

cis-nats and nat-sirnas with gene expression evidence under normal or abiotic stress conditions
to gain further insight into regulation of cis-nats, we examined the expression levels of  <dig> one-to-one type cis-nats. the  <dig> cis-nat pairs were detected as expressed  with both sense and antisense transcripts under normal , cold , salt  or drought  conditions, and also with nat-sirnas in an overlapping region . we found that  <dig> pairs produced sirnas exclusively and had more than five unique small rna reads in the overlapping regions . to explore whether small rnas were more enriched in the overlapping compared to non-overlapping regions, we calculated small rna densities of cis-nats in these two regions. the sirna densities of  <dig> cis-nats were >  <dig> times that in the non-overlapping regions . we further investigated cis-nats which generated nat-sirnas with strand bias: 25-28% of cis-nat pairs exhibited strong strand bias in spawning nat-sirnas with > 5-fold change in both normal and abiotic stresses . more than 75% of cis-nats generated small rnas from different directions with > 2-fold change . interestingly, cis-nat pairs, which were composed of the protein-coding gene partner of non-protein-coding rnas, overwhelmingly produced small rnas from the strand of protein-coding transcripts .

of  <dig> cis-nats,  <dig>  cis-nats were expressed in both normal and abiotic stresses . the cis-nat pairs could be divided into five subgroups based on a scatter plot comparing transcripts expressional ratio trends of cis-nat pairs between normal and cold stressed conditions . we also investigated the functional bias among each group of cis-nat pairs through functional domain and expressional profiling analyses. we found that protein kinase domains were commonly identified in cis-nat pairs among the five subgroups. however, other functional domains and expression levels of sense/antisense transcripts were detected to be associated with different subgroups of cis-nat pairs.


subgroup- <dig> cis-nats were predominantly associated with the pentatricopeptide repeat  and protein tyrosine kinase domains. we also found that the expression levels of the cis-nat pairs of subgroup- <dig> under stress conditions were similar to that under normal conditions. subgroup- <dig> cis-nats were identified to contain domains of leucine rich repeats and glycosyltransferase. in this subgroup, the expression levels of sense-transcripts of the cis-nat pairs were significantly increased under stress conditions, while expression levels of antisense transcripts were greatly reduced. thus, expression levels were higher for sense than for antisense transcripts under stress conditions. subgroup- <dig> can be classified as the family of alpha/beta hydrolase fold. the expression levels of sense-transcripts of the subgroup- <dig> cis-nat pairs were significantly reduced under stress conditions, while expression levels of antisense transcripts significantly increased. thus, expression levels were lower for sense than for antisense transcripts under stress conditions. subgroup- <dig> cis-nats can be classified as the families of the eukaryotic aspartyl protease and sugar  transporter. subgroup- <dig> cis-nats were identified to be the families of glycosyl hydrolases and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. the remaining four cis-nat pairs were not classified into any subgroups, as the expression levels of sense transcripts were not correlated with that of anti-sense partner under normal and abiotic conditions. we identified these four cis-nat pairs as abnormal values . subgroup- <dig> was shown to be represented the major part. ratio values of  <dig> cis-nat pairs  between normal and cold stressed conditions were highly correlated, with r <dig> >  <dig> . similar results were also observed between normal and salt/drought stressed conditions with r <dig> >  <dig>  of  <dig> pairs and r <dig> >  <dig>  of  <dig> pairs, respectively . in total, of  <dig> cis-nat pairs,  <dig> %  showed positive correlations between sense and antisense transcripts. one cis-nat pair  was taken as an example to compare expression changes under normal and cold stressed conditions . northern blot analyses also demonstrated their differential expression levels under abiotic stresses . sense transcript os05t0500000- <dig> is annotated as an udp-glucoronosyl and an udp-glucosyl transferase, which is an important enzyme for catalyzing transportation of sugars. antisense transcript os05t0500101- <dig> had no hits to any protein families.


the numbers of cis-nats expressed under different conditions were quite different . the shared cis-nats expressed under normal , cold, salt and drought conditions were also identified. among them,  <dig>  cis-nats were detected preferentially under abiotic stresses compared to normal conditions. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cis-nat pairs clearly expressed under drought, salt and cold stresses, respectively. as an example, under cold treatment, sense and antisense transcripts of cis-nat pair os09t0482800- <dig> vs. cuff. <dig>  were both much more expressed than under normal or other stressed conditions . semi-quantitative rt-pcr and reverse transcription pcr  were used to validate the expression of the cis-nat pair under normal and cold conditions . functional annotation of this cis-nat pair was composed of ef-hand protein  and ncrna . moreover,  <dig> of  <dig>  cis-nats were expressed in leaf epidermal cells. of  <dig> cis-nats,  <dig> belonged to co-expressed pairs . we further performed analysis of differentially expressed genes . in total, we identified  <dig> cis-nats with degs of at least either of each pair, which belonged to different subgroups . of them, expression levels of  <dig> cis-nats  were up-regulated under abiotic stresses, while  <dig> cis-nats were down-regulated under abiotic stresses. moreover, the results showed no clear expression pattern between transcripts and nat-sirnas . the number of nat-sirnas notably increased along with higher transcriptional expression level under cold-stress conditions ; in contrast, some cis-nats generated less nat-sirnas, along with higher expression levels . in addition, some cis-nats generated nat-sirnas with more complex expression patterns .


we used an enrichment analysis of pfam protein families  <cit>  to functionally characterize three sets that could be annotated from  <dig> cis-nats. the three sets were  <dig> cis-nat pairs of protein-coding genes and non-protein-coding rnas ,  <dig> cis-nat pairs of protein-coding genes and predicted cds without any pfam domain-containing , and  <dig> cis-nats composed of both protein-coding genes , respectively. roughly,  <dig> protein families were the major enriched terms in either of three sets . of them, four proteins exhibited distinctively enriched terms with p-values <  <dig> . ppr families were enriched in set iii, leucine rich repeat and nb-arc domain were significantly reduced in set iii, and udp-glucoronosyl and udp-glucosyl transferase were significantly enriched in set ii .

networks formed by cis-nat groups
we further investigated networks formed by cis-nats in rice, named ‘many-to-many’ cis-nats, i.e. one transcript in a cis-nat had more than one antisense partner. networks formed by cis-nats reflect the complexity of their post-transcriptional regulation. it has been reported that in arabidopsis, several genes are involved in two cis-nats, one is convergent and the other divergent  <cit> . in rice, we found  <dig> cis-nats  involved in  <dig> cis-nat groups . of them,  <dig> groups belonged to one-to-two type, nine belonged to one-to-three type, four belonged to two-to-two groups, and one belonged to one-to-four group, respectively. five types were identified in one-to-two cis-nat groups . except  <dig> groups which were composed of convergent together with divergent cis-nats, it also included  <dig> enclosed together with enclosed,  <dig> enclosed together with divergent,  <dig> enclosed together with convergent, and one convergent together with convergent. interestingly, we found only  <dig> - <dig> % cis-nat groups could be detected with simultaneous expression evidence and nat-sirnas in the same sample from normal, cold, salt or drought conditions; another  <dig> - <dig> % cis-nat groups were either expressed . similar to one-to-one type cis-nats, protein kinase domain, leucine rich repeats, nb-arc domain and the ppr repeat family were the major enriched pfam protein domains.

discussion
increasing amounts of evidence indicate that antisense transcripts are frequently functional and play various biological roles using different transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . consequently, we tried to advance rice cis-nats analysis through an integrated approach of ssrna-seq of rice transcriptome and genome-wide in silico transcriptome data analysis.

there have been five previous studies using global investigation of rice cis-nats. an analysis of  <dig>  full-length rice cdna sequences showed  <dig> bidirectional transcript pairs  <cit> . comprehensive expression profiles of rice using mpss technology identified  <dig>  antisense signatures corresponding to  <dig> annotated genes with highly specific expression patterns  <cit> . a comparative analysis of cis-nats in eukaryotes identified  <dig> rice cis-nats referring to msu and kome gene datasets  <cit> . combining pyrophosphate-based high-throughput sequencing of rice small rna and computational analysis of the msu rice gene models identified  <dig> cis-nats formed by protein-coding genes  <cit> . recently,  <dig> pairs of cis-nats were identified using the rice genome annotation data   <cit> . in this study, we identified  <dig> pairs of rice cis-nats. of them,  <dig> were identified as expressed and gave rise to small rnas from their overlapping regions. the pairs of cis-nats were confirmed to be formed in laser microdissection-captured rice seedling leaf epidermal cells, which were developed from a single-cell tissue. this indicated that antisense transcripts were more widespread and of more complex occurrence than previously found in the rice genome.

moreover, qrt-pcr and northern blot analyses confirmed the presence of cis-nats and differential expression levels under normal and abiotic stresses. nearly  <dig> % of rice transcripts were involved in one-to-one or many-to-many cis-nats formation. an overwhelming majority of cis-nats  were of one-to-one type. small rnas generated from cis-nats were broadly detected under either normal developmental conditions or stresses. similar to the situation for mammals  <cit> , we found that the most prominent form of antisense transcription in rice was a non-coding rna partner of a protein-coding transcript.

we identified  <dig> novel gene loci in this study. compared with previous research, more novel transcribed activity regions with reliable transcriptional orientation were identified by ssrna-seq. this also indicated that exploration of the rice transcriptome atlas is far from finished. along with further progress of high-throughput sequencing technology and development of more efficient software for de novo transcriptome assembly, more accurate transcriptional units  could be defined in the future.

it should be pointed out that in our research about  <dig> - <dig> % of reads appeared to be aligned to antisense transcripts in error . this is higher than the  <dig> % rate reported by wang et al.  <cit> , who used a slightly modified version of this dutp method by increasing the incubation time with udg to enforce the complete degradation of dutps.

in consideration of the limited amount of rnai-related small rnas  in public databases, we proposed the following:  more micrornas and sirnas need to be identified and  more classes of small rnas that are engaged in rnai-related machinery or those that are not will be found in future.

CONCLUSIONS
by applying a strand-specific rna-seq approach, we systematically identified rice cis-natural antisense transcripts and putative nat-sirnas. our study profiled the most abundant of transcriptional active regions and revealed widespread occurrence of cis-nats in rice, suggesting that regulation through cis-nats and nat-sirnas could be a common biological phenomenon. both ssrna-seq data and small rna data obtained by high-throughput sequencing technology would supply important resources for further rice transcriptome analysis. it also indicated the feasibility of global investigations of cis-nats by ssrna-seq in eukaryotic genomes.
