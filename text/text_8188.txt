BACKGROUND
one of the remarkable characteristics of the genomic era is that the solution to the challenge of annotation posed by the rapid increase in sequences, comes in part from the data itself; i.e. the availability of a large number of fully sequenced genomes provides information that enables the development of new computational approaches including domain fusion  <cit> , chromosomal proximity  <cit>  and phylogenetic profiling  <cit> .

phylogenetic profiling, in its original form, was used to infer the function of a gene by finding another gene of known function with an identical pattern of presence and absence across a set of phylogenetically distributed genomes. such restricted profiling, requiring full profile identity, while accurate, has low coverage, assigning pathways to  <dig> of  <dig> unknown orthologous proteins from  <dig> genomes  <cit> , with an estimated accuracy in the vicinity of 90%. the restriction can be relaxed in a number of ways, using a pearson correlation, mutual information  <cit> , or mathematically exact statistical significance assignment. in a previous paper  <cit>  we examined each of these methods, and settled on the last of them as a convenient and generally valid measure.

briefly, the phylogenetic profile of a gene is a binary string recording the presence  or absence  of an ortholog across a suitable set of genomes. we use orthologs as defined in the cog database  <cit> . if the correlation between the profiles of two genes, x and y, is much greater than would be expected by chance, then they are assumed to be functionally related. let n be the number of genomes over which the profiles are defined, with gene x occurring in x genomes, y occurring in y genomes, and both occurring in z genomes. assuming the gene content of all genomes are independent of each other, then p, the probability of observing z co-occurrences purely by chance, given n, x and y is

the connection between equation  and the more readily calculated mutual information, mi, of the profile pair, is easily if tediously established. in particular for a given profile pair, define p,  as the fraction of genomes in which gene x is in state i; i.e. present , or absent , and gene y is in state j, so that p is the fraction of genomes in which both genes are present, p is the fraction in which x is present and y is absent, etc. in addition p=∑j=01p

as a rule of thumb, the difference between mi and the more general correlate, eq 3b, can safely be ignored for profiles when all variables are greater than  <dig>  in this paper we expect only inconsequential differences between eqs  <dig> and 3b since we will be looking at profiles across  <dig> microbes .

the simplest decision rule on which to base the correlate is guilt by association   <cit> , which assigns an unannotated gene to all known categories of an annotated gene if the phylogenetic profiles exceed some specific correlation threshold, c*. assessments of this procedure often look promising. for example, a threshold of c* =  <dig>  , links  <dig> of the  <dig>  unannotated orthologs to at least one pathway annotated gene, and 80%  are estimated to be correctly linked at least once. as we indicate below, however, such an assessment criterion conveys an overly optimistic picture of performance.

in contrast to sga, correlation enrichment  assigns an unannotated gene by ranking each category  with a score reflecting  the number of  genes within a category, whose profile correlation with that of the unannotated gene exceeds a pre-specified threshold, and  the magnitudes of these correlations 

one of the difficulties in comparing different methods is a lack of standardized performance measures. different authors sometimes use different measures of performance ; performance is not always fully assessed; the same measure is sometimes defined in different ways, and performance as a function of coverage is not always available. in this paper we therefore evaluate a complete set of performance measures and their response characteristics as coverage is varied, against three different ontologies. we find that ce substantially outperforms sga in allocating genes to functional categories. we were able to assign all  <dig> kegg unannotated orthologs to pathways with an estimated average precision of 49%, and all cog unannotated orthologs to cog categories, with an estimate of precision for each assignment. finally, we identify several dozen cliques or quasi-cliques, some only partially annotated, placing unannotated genes in evolutionarily conserved functional modules with very high reliability.

RESULTS
comparison of decision rules
the simplest embodiment of sga is assignment based on profile identity  <cit> . for pathway inferences based on identity, all measures of reliability are very high , but only  <dig> % of unannotated orthologs are assignable to kegg pathways relaxing the requirement for an exact match increases coverage and the expected number of correct predictions, but specificity and positive predictive value  both deteriorate markedly . for example setting correlation threshold c* =  <dig>   to achieve a coverage of 90% requires accepting a ppv of 6%. notably, although ppv is very low at c* =  <dig> , 90% of the genes are assigned correctly to at least one pathway, indicating that a <dig>  is not a useful measure of performance. when inferences are based on correlation enrichment, ppv is markedly increased at high coverage, exceeding its sga value approximately  <dig> fold, whereas the two decision rules perform similarly at coverages below 20% .

ppv estimates are conservative: assignment of a gene to a pathway in which it is currently not annotated could mean that the presence of the gene in that pathway has not yet been discovered; i.e. such assignments need not be false positives, even though they are counted as such. that many of the putative false positives are in fact functionally related to the assigned pathway is seen by searching the go ontology. in particular, of the  <dig> genes that are allocated to kegg pathways in which they are currently not annotated ,  <dig> have go annotations. of those  <dig>  more than 60% share at least one go category at a depth of  <dig> or greater, with the pathway genes. the fact that an unannotated gene shares a go category with genes in the pathways to which it is assigned suggests that these are plausible predictions rather than false positives.

a more general assessment against the gene ontology confirms the superior performance of ce. for example, at c* =  <dig>  where the sga and ce curves for positive predictive value have reached about half their maximum divergence , ce performs substantially better than sga at all go specificity levels . the use of mi  rather than the more general relation  has essentially no effect on these results .

comparison with other published methods
non-homology based functional assignments have been made using a number of different datasets, including evolutionary methods, expression profiling  <cit> , large scale protein-protein interaction  data  <cit> , microrna targeted mrna  <cit>  and pattern of annotation  <cit> . for example the function of an annotated gene is transferred to an unannotated gene if they are found to interact via the yeast two hybrid assay, or if the correlation in their expression profiles exceed a fixed, arbitrarily set threshold. for any given dataset, a number of different methods have been proposed to draw functional inferences, including "majority vote"  <cit>  and statistical models such as markov random field  <cit> . these methods can assign function based on the network-context of unannotated genes, i.e. the number of neighbors that are associated with proteins annotated to a particular category using one or another ontology.

predictive reliability can be increased by combining them using one or another statistical framework  <cit> such as support vector machines, bayesian inferences  <cit>  and markov random field  <cit> , though generally with some loss in predictive coverage. for example, y2h data, which in itself is binary and un-weighted, has been weighted with expression data, and inferences were made using markov random field  <cit> . context methods work well when properties are highly correlated with those of several other nodes, but effectiveness deteriorates rapidly as correlation stringency drops. as discussed below, ce has the desirable property of having relatively good performance even at weak correlations, thus increasing coverage.

pair-wise protein links based on phylogenetic profiling have also been accumulated in databases such as string, prolinks and phydbac etc  <cit> . the importance of these results is that they are based on a combination of methods, rather than just a single method. however, they all core pairwise links; i.e. they use sga as a decision rule for individual methods, rather than of gene-category association . although combining score is important, a combined score is also limited by the decision rule for the individual methods. here we have focused on a decision rule, which can be applied generally, and developed and evaluated it for phylogenetic profiling using three different ontologies.

finally we note that mcdermott  <cit>  showed using sga to assign genes to go categories, that the fraction of genes assigned correctly to at least one category decreases from  <dig>  to ~ <dig>  as functional specificity increases, with coverage fixed at around 40%. at a comparable coverage using ce, the fraction correctly assigned to at least one category is  <dig>  at the lowest specificity level, and remains above  <dig>  at all specificity levels.

identifying functional and evolutionary modules
several methods have been proposed to identify functional modules  <cit> . here we illustrate module identification by phylogenetic profiling where no specific clustering algorithms are needed.

inferences based on the cog ontology
cog functional categories provide only a low resolution, but fully resolved, annotation. because the ontology is a one gene to one functional category map, performance assessment is relatively direct; in particular, ac  is  <dig> or  <dig>  and therefore ppv = a <dig> , the fraction of genes assigned correctly to at least one functional category.

an all against all profiling by ce of the full set of  <dig>  genes, annotated and unannotated, at a threshold of c* =  <dig> , returns a  <dig> genes linked to at least one annotated gene . each of the  <dig> genes, including  <dig> that are unannotated, is therefore assignable to a cog category. performance is estimated by the fraction of annotated genes that are correctly assigned, which is 68% .

sets of genes assigned to the same cog functional categories  are grouped together into meta-nodes , each containing genes that are classifiable as true or false positives , or predictions . for example, of the  <dig> genes allocated to category h ,  <dig> of  <dig> are annotated in category h , and eight others are predictions. predictions based on cog functional categories can be accessed online  <cit> .

a more detailed version of the category h tp set  reveals two strikingly dense clusters – one with  <dig> orthologs, the other with  <dig>  all genes in the latter participate in the p orphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathway . the cluster is a highly interdependent functional module and it is also strikingly conserved as demonstrated by its aligned profiles . the genes in the seven member cluster are not annotated in kegg. however, four of them are annotated in go and they all share go category 0006777: molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis, at depth  <dig>  it therefore appears likely that the remaining  <dig> cogs are important components of molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis in one or more genomes. these results indicate the power of ce to uncover evolutionarily conserved highly specific functional modules, and to reliably assign previously unannotated genes to these modules.

cliques, clusters and inference quality
functional modules can be most easily identified by setting a high correlation threshold, discarding all genes that do not meet it, and displaying, as linked nodes, all pairs that exceed the threshold. at the high thresholds used in such an approach, there is no distinction between ce and sga for function prediction .

in general  we find that as the threshold decreases from its most stringent value,  the number of clusters containing more than  <dig> nodes increases, peaking at c* =  <dig>   and then declines as the nodes coalesce into increasingly larger clusters. the following remarks are relevant to the region to the right of the peak in figure  <dig> 

at c* =  <dig>  we recover a tightly correlated 9-component fully annotated subnet of the flagella assembly pathway . in contrast, the 12-node module , is not fully annotated – but eight of its members are in the kegg lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway. since it is highly connected , with all linkage strengths equal to or greater than c* =  <dig> , enrichment for lipopolysaccharide metabolism is very strong, and each of the unknown cogs is almost certainly associated with that function. a weak enrichment-based lower bound on ppv is  <dig> .

of the three cliques  –  one is fully annotated and two are mixed. the former demonstrates recovery of a tightly correlated segment of the histadine metabolism pathway. the latter two are enriched with components of, respectively, the amino sugars metabolism pathway and the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway. since they are obtained at c* =  <dig> , the unannotated genes are likely to be in the indicated pathway, a conservative estimate of accuracy of assignments  being 94%

more generally for c* =  <dig> , there are  <dig> cliques and quasi-cliques. of these,  <dig> are partially annotated. their properties, and lower bounds on the correct allocation of the unknown orthologs to the majority function of the cliques, are available online  <cit> . similar remarks hold for the six node clique, which has four genes implicated in the aminosugars metabolism pathway.

four genes in the smallest clique are part of a multi-subunit complex, which is has a descriptor na+ /h+ antiporter in the cog ontology. two of the domains have kegg annotations in the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway  and oxidative phosphorylation pathway  in a subset of the genomes in which they co-occur. in the other genomes in which they co-occur, pathway annotation is missing. the strong correlation obtained between these two annotated domains is plausible since ubiquinone is known to be involved in respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation. in addition, all links  are equally strong, suggesting that the two unannotated genes are also required for the respiratory chain in the genomes in which the other two are annotated, including pyrococcus horikoshii, pyrococcus abyssi, and rickettsia prowazekii.

our predictions not only suggest functions for unannotated genes but also add new functions for annotated genes. these plausible functions do not contradict the existing annotation but rather, amplify a pleiotropic theme i.e. proteins can have multiple functions. in fact, on average each gene is assigned to  <dig>  pathways in kegg and 2– <dig> go categories at all levels. even genes clustered at the most stringent c* threshold  are assigned to more than one pathways, e.g. fliq is not only assigned to flagella assembly pathway  but also to type iii secretion system .

CONCLUSIONS
the method serves as a general computational tool for annotating large numbers of unknown genes, uncovering evolutionary and functional modules. it appears to perform substantially better than extant stand alone high throughout methods.

finally, we note that a potentially fundamental limitation of phylogenetic profiling is the confounding influence of correlations between genomes, as opposed to correlations between genes. while we do not report a complete study of the effect of inter-genome correlations, we estimated its potential influence by collapsing those genomes that are phylogenetically close, essentially assuming that all correlations between gene pairs that are present within a group of related genomes are the result of genome correlation rather than gene correlation. we find that, for this conservative model, genome correlations have only a small effect on the performance of the method given a reasonable number of lineages. in fact, when  <dig> genomes are collapsed  to as few as  <dig> lineages based on their phylogenetic distances measured by genome content  <cit> , the corresponding change in ppv for the same coverage is always less than 1%.

we conclude that a principal source of variance between phylogenetic correlation and category assignments is in the way proteins are grouped by the ontologies. a given level of functional correlation between genes, as determined by any particular correlate, whether experimental  or computational, does not assure a particular level of category specificity , nor does co-presence at a particular category specificity level assure that a given level of correlation will be achieved. representing relations between genes in accordance with ontological categories on the one hand or in accordance with evolutionary or biochemical correlations on the other, have elements of arbitrariness and uncertainty and consequently are expected to yield, to the extent that they are valid, overlapping but not identical classifications.
