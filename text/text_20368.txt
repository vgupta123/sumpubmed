BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig>  million snps have been identified in human genes and have been deposited in the dbsnp database  and are used by the ensembl database . snp does not only mean exchange of a nucleotide but also a deletion or insertion of one base in the dbsnp database . for many snps located in genes the effects on the genes are not known. application of the new sequencing technologies  <dig> and solexa will allow the discovery of many more snps which need elucidation of their effects. it is important to know the effect as snps can be relevant for diseases e.g. a snp in the apoe gene increases the risk for developing alzheimer disease  <cit> . snps account for differences in cancer risk  and drug metabolism  <cit> . available prediction tools for snps like ls-snp  <cit>  mostly evaluate if the snp is within a coding region and changes or abolishes the protein. others contain a collection of previously evaluated snps which can be queried by snp id, disease or chromosomal region  <cit> . those snps are analysed and scored according to location of the snp  and known effects in diseases. a further list with more than ten web servers which analyze snps can be found in karchin,  <dig> <cit> . in contrast, our tool aassites looks at the potential of the snps to modify the splicing pattern of a gene and does not depend on the annotation of known snps. modified splicing is likely to have a profound effect on the phenotype with relevance to disease risk or drug metabolism. a change in splicing can be caused by modifying any of the components of the splicing machinery such as splice sites or splice enhancers or silencers. those are evaluated separately to predict a score for modulated splicing by “skippy”  <cit> . a new tool called splicescanii  <cit>  is looking at all those elements for predicting splice changes in genetic variants and has proven to work in the context of disease-linked variations. aassites uses the power of gene prediction programs which are trained to evaluate the splice relevant components in order to predict changes in splicing patterns caused by snps. additionally, esedetector  <cit>  for discovering changes in eses, and programs to detect changes in the open reading frame  are used. a handmade rule system combines the results and classifies the snp as “likely”, “probably” or “unlikely” to lead to modified splicing of the gene.

RESULTS
the analysis tool aassites
the tool was designed to analyse one snp provided within the context of a dna sequence together with the ensembl gene id  of the snp origin. if the input sequence contains more than one snp belonging to one gene, the different snps will be analysed separately. aassites uses those gene prediction programs capable of correctly predicting the wt intron/exon structure to compare the intron/exon structure of the wt sequence with that of the sequence containing the snp . additionally, a change in eses and changes in the orf or amino acid content are checked and reported. based on the distance of the snp to the splice site, the predicted changes in the intron/exon structure and the result of the orf analysis a classification of the snp into  <dig> classes is given : likely, probable and unlikely. in the output, details about the gene predictions, ese changes, orf and amino acid changes are also given . the tool is available at http://genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de/menu/biounit/open-husar. it has an average runtime of approximately  <dig> minutes.

test of aassites using known snps
we tested the pipeline aassites with known example snps to evaluate the performance. the database dbass  contains mutations and their experimentally revealed effects on splicing. as described in methods,  <dig> snps with manually checked and exactly described effects on splicing  and  <dig> randomly selected mutations from dbass <dig> ,  <dig> snps causing only an amino acid exchange, and  <dig> randomly selected snps from dbsnp were used for testing aassites. 66% of the positive snps were classified as likely or probable to cause a change in splicing, whereas 100% of all the negative snps were classified as unlikely . overall, 83% of all cases were classified correctly. looking at the positive set  <dig> with  <dig> sequences, in 43% of the cases not only the change in splicing, but also the documented exon/intron modification was predicted correctly. in the negative set, 79% of the cases were predicted as documented. because of the lack of snp data with experimentally proven splice changes at that time, the dataset was quite small and cannot be used to provide significant values for sensitivity and specificity. but the test showed that aassites appears to have a reasonable prediction rate. the comparison with splicescanii checking for modified or additional/skipped exons showed a better classification rate for aassites, mainly because it is better in the classification of negative examples.

genome-wide analysis of snps near splice sites
since some snps are known to be linked with diseases like cancer and play a role in metastasis and resistance of the tumours to drugs, we wanted to screen human genes for snps capable of causing changes in splicing of genes. in such a set there should be candidates which can cause a disease by creating a modified protein. due to the high number of all snps which would take up too much computing time we had to reduce the number of snps to screen. because snps with low frequencies in the population are not relevant for common diseases we selected snps that have a prevalence of over 10% in the population. to raise the chance for identification of splice modifying snps we limited the distance to the splice site. therefore, we selected  <dig>  snps near splice sites  with a population frequency above  <dig>  in ceu. those snps were run through our aassites pipeline and the xml output files were parsed via a perl script. the whole run took about  <dig> weeks on our linux server .  <dig>  snps  could be analysed by aassites. 89% of the analysed snps were located in an exon,  <dig> % were located in an intron. the results of the classification are shown in table  <dig>   <dig> snps  could not be analysed, either because the gene was longer than 350kb or because no gene prediction was available.

identification of snps with known splice changes
we compared the snps classified as likely or probable to impact the gene’s splicing pattern with snps found in the sssnp target database  <cit> . in this database snps at splice sites with known changes affecting splicing and of relevance for diseases are listed.  <dig> snps identified by aassites are listed in the sssnp target database with annotated and experimentally proven changes in splicing and the associated diseases in omim, gad or hgmd . in  <dig> cases out of the  <dig> the splice change predicted by one of the gene prediction programs is exactly the one annotated in the sssnp entry . the associated diseases are lung cancer  <cit> , renal cell carcinoma  <cit> , tuberous sclerosis  <cit> , hyperglyciaemia  <cit> , prostate cancer  <cit>  and cutis laxa  <cit>  .

localization of the snps modifying splicing
the positions of all the snps and those of snps which were classified as likely or probable are shown in figure  <dig> for intronic snps and in figure  <dig> for exonic snps. in the intron , it is mainly the first two positions starting from the splice site that account for splice variations. in the exon , the number of splice-modifying snps is much lower than in the intron due to the mutation restrictions of the coding sequence. the number of splice relevant snps decreases with an increase of the distance to the splice site and shows a steep decline during the first  <dig> positions in introns and exons, but even at a greater distance some splice modifying snps are found. because of the possible bias of the database towards disease-related gene sequencing, the numbers are likely to be an underestimate.

pathway distribution of the genes with snps modifying splicing
we have analyzed the genes according to their annotated pathways with the david tools . of originally  <dig> snps on  <dig> genes, the david database recognized  <dig> genes according to their ensembl identifiers. the analysis produced a table of  <dig> genes with their pathways. the over-represented pathways are shown in table  <dig>  among the top over-represented pathways ones like “focal adhesion”, “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450”, and “abc transporters general” can be found. these pathways are very often disturbed in cancer cells.

the overexpressed pathways are shown together with the number of genes involved in the pathway , the percentage of genes involved in the pathway compared to all input genes , and the p value from the fisher test calculated by the david tool.

discussion
to identify snps which modify the protein by changing the splicing pattern the pipeline aassites was developed. this pipeline is available through its web interface at http://genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de/menu/biounit/open-husar. unlike many other snp analysis tools our tool predicts the effect of snps on splicing. not only snps localized at splice sites can modify the splicing of a gene, but also snps near splice sites can have the same effect due to other regulatory sequences involved. gene prediction programs take these regulatory sequences into account by using hmm models or similar algorithms. still, we could not predict  <dig> genes because in these cases none of the five gene prediction programs worked correctly on the wt sequence. this minor problem could be solved by the implementation of one or two more prediction tools. a second problem is the prediction of snps in alternatively spliced products. most gene prediction programs do not predict alternative splice sites. the only exception is augustus  <cit>  which should be implemented. then also the different alternatively spliced wild type forms of the gene have to be considered.

we have shown with a set of snps known to affect or not to affect splicing, that the pipeline was able to correctly predict the change in splicing caused by the snp in 83% of  <dig> cases. the problem of testing and improving the rule system for combining the results lies in the small number of experimentally proven snp-derived modifications in splicing. with more experimental data available we could replace the rule system by a knowledge system based on machine learning algorithms or we could optimize the rules. the comparison with splicescanii  <cit>  shows that aassites performs better on our small test set. but the number of examples is much too small for a final evaluation.

new tools could be implemented to assist aassites by selecting the correct splice change if different changes are predicted by the different gene prediction tools. a further analysis of the predicted splice sites with tools like the “human splicing finder”  <cit>  which predicts the effect of mutations on the splice signals or “skippy”  <cit>  which analyses eses and esss and the evolutionary constraint of the region surrounding the variant could complement our approach.

another improvement could be the evaluation of different snps of the same haplotype together. at the moment, aassites treats all snps as being independent. the analysis is done for only one snp at a time, even if the input sequence contains several snps. that is the reason, that the combined effects of multiple snps are missed.

the genome-wide analysis of known snps near splice sites revealed  <dig> snps which are probably capable of modifying the protein by changed splicing. it could be shown, that not only snps directly at splice sites are likely to modify splicing. among the splice relevant snps were  <dig> cases which were experimentally verified and involved in the genesis of diseases according to the sssnp target database proving the functionality of the pipeline. other snps in genes which are related to diseases were found and could be candidates for further research.

CONCLUSIONS
to identify snps which modify the protein by changing the splicing pattern the pipeline aassites was developed. this pipeline uses gene prediction programs for this purpose and is available through its web interface at http://genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de/menu/biounit/open-husar. the genome-wide analysis of human snps near splice sites revealed  <dig> snps which are probably capable of modifying the protein by changed splicing. some already known snps were identified, but other snps in genes related to diseases could be good candidate snps for further research.
