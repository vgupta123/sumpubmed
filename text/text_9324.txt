BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides  are components of the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates, having a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa  <cit> . in general, amps are small molecules with  <dig> to  <dig> kda of molecular mass and exhibit a high content of basic amino acids, which results in an overall positive net charge. amps also usually have an amphipathic structure. thus, while the positive charges of basic amino acids facilitate interaction with the negative charges of the phospholipids of biological membranes, the hydrophobic amino acids facilitate the insertion of amps into the membrane, which will eventually lead to lysis of the microorganisms. some amps can act on internal targets, such as the inhibition of nucleic acid and/or protein synthesis  <cit> . alternatively, some amps selectively boost the host immune response through the regulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and by promoting the chemotaxis of t cells, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. they can also effect dendritic cell differentiation and stimulate angiogenesis  <cit> .

gomesin is a cationic amp isolated from haemocytes of the tarantula spider acanthoscurria gomesiana <cit> . this peptide contains  <dig> amino acids and two disulphide bridges and adopts a β-hairpin structure  <cit> . the disulphide bridges provide stability in mammalian serum and resistance to proteolysis  <cit> . gomesin exerts a strong microbicidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, filamentous fungi, yeast, parasites and tumour cells through a mechanism of pore formation or "detergent like" action  <cit> .

candidiasis is an infection caused by fungi from the genus candida and can affect the skin, eyes, oral cavity, oesophagus, gastrointestinal tract, vagina and vascular system of humans. most infections occur in patients who are immunocompromised or debilitated  <cit> . vulvovaginal candidiasis is the most common form of mucosal disease, affecting up to 75% of women . in brazil, candidiasis has become a public health problem. it is the 3rd leading cause of death from systemic mycosis in aids-negative patients. records indicate an increase in mortality from an annual average of  <dig> deaths between  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig>  taking in account the deaths of aids patients with underlying cases of candidiasis, the disease is the 2nd leading cause of death from systemic mycosis, with  <dig>  deaths in brazil from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . nosocomial candidiasis is also a public problem in brazil  <cit> . in the usa, candida species are the fourth leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections in several hospitals and the mortality from  <dig> to  <dig> was approximately  <dig>  deaths per  <dig>  population per year . the leading treatment of candida infections is done with polyenes , azoles  and echinocandins   <cit> . regardless of which antifungal drug is used, there is frequent treatment failure  <cit> . in this paper, we show the potential therapeutic use of gomesin in an experimental infection of c. albicans.

RESULTS
evaluation of the antifungal activity of gomesin in vitro
the minimum inhibitory concentration  of gomesin in the isolate  <dig> and strain atcc  <dig> was  <dig>  μm and  <dig> μm, respectively, while the mic of fluconazole in the isolate  <dig> and strain atcc  <dig> was  <dig> μm and >  <dig>  mm, respectively. in addition, we observed growth inhibition of the isolate  <dig> with the combined treatment of  <dig>  μm gomesin and  <dig>  μm fluconazole. growth inhibition of strain atcc  <dig> was observed with the combined concentration of  <dig>  μm gomesin and  <dig>  μm fluconazole . furthermore, the fractional inhibitory concentration index  of the combination of gomesin and fluconazole was  <dig>  in isolate  <dig> and  <dig>  in strain atcc  <dig> .

evaluation of the antifungal activity of gomesin in mice with disseminated and vaginal candidiasis
treatment with  <dig> mg/kg and  <dig> mg/kg of gomesin in mice with disseminated candidiasis effectively reduced the fungal burden of the kidneys, spleen and liver when compared with the control group  . treatment with  <dig> mg/kg and  <dig> mg/kg of fluconazole also effectively controlled the infection . moreover, treatment of vaginal candidiasis with  <dig> % and  <dig> % gomesin and 2% miconazole showed a significant decrease in colony forming units  when compared with vehicle treatment  . the combination of gomesin and fluconazole or miconazole did not result in a synergistic effect.

cytokine levels in kidneys of gomesin-treated mice
treatment with gomesin and fluconazole significantly increased the concentration of tnf-α, ifn-γ and il- <dig> in the kidneys compared to controls that were not infected and not treated as well as controls that were infected and treated with pbs .

evaluation of the effect of antifungal drugs in immunosuppressed mice with disseminated candidiasis
the group of infected animals that received pbs  reached 100% mortality on the fifteenth day after infection. no statistically significant difference was observed between the group treated with gomesin  and the group treated with fluconazole , although there was an increase in survival during the last treatment. nonetheless, the combined treatment of  <dig> mg/kg of gomesin and  <dig> mg/kg of fluconazole produced a survival rate of 23% within  <dig> days after infection, which was statistically significant. the control groups that were not infected or those that received pbs or  <dig> mg/kg of gomesin remained alive until the end of the experiment .

in vivo toxicity
gomesin administration did not alter the number of leukocytes in the non-infected mice. however, when specific cell populations were analysed, the number of neutrophils and eosinophils were increased, whereas the number of lymphocytes was decreased. the administration of gomesin did not alter the haemoglobin levels. nevertheless, treatment with gomesin resulted in an increase in the percentage of circulating reticulocytes. moreover, the administration of gomesin showed no change in the levels of total bilirubin, direct and indirect, as well as creatinine and gamma-gt .

biodistribution of radiolabeled gomesin
the biodistribution of gomesin labelled with technetium- <dig> m was evaluated in the kidneys, spleen and liver . the liver had the highest percentage of radiolabeled peptide detected , which persisted for up to  <dig> h post-injection, whereas the kidneys showed a radioactive peak at  <dig> min followed by a gradual decrease during the following hours. the spleen was the lowest of the organs tested  and was stable for only  <dig> min after administration of technetium- <dig> m-labelled gomesin, dropping to undetectable levels after  <dig> min.

discussion
gomesin is an antimicrobial peptide isolated from haemocytes of the spider acanthoscurria gomesiana and has a broad-spectrum of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa and tumour cells  <cit> . the antifungal activity of gomesin in vitro has previously been reported  <cit> . however, the antifungal activity against clinical isolates of candida albicans resistant to antifungal drugs has not been studied. in this paper, we analysed the antifungal activity of gomesin in vitro and in vivo against a clinical strain of c. albicans , as well as its biodistribution and toxicity in mice.

our data showed that c. albicans  is resistant to fluconazole up to  <dig>  mm, but gomesin is effective against this strain at a lower concentration . this resistance to fluconazole is a common cause of treatment failure  <cit> . a synergism between gomesin and fluconazole against two isolates of candida albicans  was demonstrated using the fici calculation method. the synergistic mechanism of gomesin and fluconazole is not completely understood, but studies with cryptococcus neoformans suggested that gomesin, through membrane permeabilisation, promotes an increased entry of fluconazole into the fungal cytoplasm, which results in a better inhibition of the ergosterol synthesis. in this way, fluconazole is effective against c. neoformans at lower doses when applied in combination with gomesin  <cit> . a similar phenomenon was observed in murine melanoma cells  treated with gomesin and the monoclonal mab a4m in vitro. the cytotoxicity of mab a4m was only detected in the presence of gomesin, after permeabilisation of the cell membrane allowed the entry and action of the monoclonal antibody  <cit> . from these studies, we hypothesised that gomesin facilitates the entry of fluconazole in candida albicans through membrane permeabilisation.

the literature on the use of antimicrobial peptides in the treatment of disseminated candidiasis is rather scarce. a study of the hlf peptide  originated from lactoferrin in immunosuppressed mice with disseminated candidiasis showed that a single dose of  <dig>  ng/kg,  <dig> h after infection, was able to significantly reduce cfu in the kidneys  <cit> . etd- <dig>  an analogue of heliomicin also has been shown to be particularly effective against systemic candidiasis in comparison with amphotericin b and several azoles  <cit> . likewise, treatment with gomesin proved to be effective against disseminated candidiasis. the peptide effectively reduced the fungal burden in the kidneys, which is the highest tropism organ for candida. a similar effect was observed with fluconazole; however, this drug has some toxic effects and has selected resistance in candida albicans  <cit> . therefore, the use of gomesin as a therapeutic may be an alternative treatment for candidiasis because our results show that it is non-toxic in mice. unlike in vitro treatment with gomesin and fluconazole, we have not detected any the synergistic effect of treatment with both drugs in vivo.

the treatment and prevention of recurrent vaginal candidiasis includes the use of imidazoles and triazoles as a first-line treatment, unless it is caused by a confirmed or suspected azole-resistant candida strain. the efficacy of both oral and local therapy is similar, but, the local treatment presents several advantages, including a reduction of adverse effects; however, local treatment is contraindicated during pregnancy and breast feeding  <cit> . in recent years, there has been a focus on both understanding drug resistance to antifungal agents and optimising therapy of candida infections  <cit> . there are no reports of topical treatment with antimicrobial peptides against vaginal candidiasis. in this paper, we are the first to describe an effective topical formulation of an antimicrobial peptide that is able to reduce cfus count in an experimental vaginal candidiasis model. we found that  <dig> % and  <dig> % gomesin cream reduced the cfu on vaginas of the animals by  <dig> fold when compared to control animals. minor changes in the treatment protocol with gomesin, either by increasing the frequency or changing the doses, may potentially produce better results. treatment with 2% miconazole cream was also effective in controlling the cfus of the vaginas of the animals. however, it was necessary to use a dose of miconazole that was at least four times higher than the dose of gomesin to produce a similar effect. no synergistic effect was observed after treatment with a combination of gomesin and miconazole.

in addition to the direct action of amps on microorganisms, either through membrane permeabilisation or internal target interference  <cit> , it has been reported that some amps may possess an immunomodulatory function  <cit> . in order to verify if gomesin has such activity, the concentrations of ifn-γ, tnf-α and il- <dig> were evaluated in the kidneys of mice that had been infected with c. albicans and treated with this peptide. these cytokines, especially il- <dig>  activate neutrophils, which play an essential role in the defence mechanism against candida <cit> . we observed that treatment with  <dig> mg/kg gomesin significantly increased the concentration of the three cytokines analysed. a similar effect was also observed with fluconazole treatment. the increase of cytokine levels in the kidneys might help to control candidiasis through the activation of the host immune system. this action appears to be similar to that observed with another amp, murine β defensin- <dig>  which acts via tlr <dig> and leads to the production of various cytokines, such as il- <dig> and il- <dig>  as well as chemokines  <cit> . however, we cannot dismiss the hypothesis that the direct action of gomesin can trigger the release of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or pamps, which would exacerbate the immune response of animals. this has been previously reported for the antimicrobial peptide human β defensin- <dig>  <cit> . the use of antimicrobial peptides as immunomodulatory agents for therapeutic application is an effervescent field in progress  <cit> .

after verifying that the gomesin treatment was effective against disseminated candidiasis in healthy mice, we decided to evaluate the activity of gomesin in immunosuppressed animals, as candidiasis is typically observed in immunocompromised hosts  <cit> . treatment with gomesin  showed no significant increase in survival compared to control animals. this suggests that the direct action of gomesin was not sufficient to control the infection and that immunomodulatory action is required to suppress the candidiasis. treatment with fluconazole  also did not result in a significant increase in the survival of treated animals as compared to control animals. however, the combined treatment of  <dig> mg/kg gomesin and  <dig> mg/kg of fluconazole resulted in 23% survival of mice  <dig> days after infection. this could be due to gomesin facilitating the entry of fluconazole into the yeast, thus leading to the survival of animals. another hypothesis is that treatment with fluconazole, being fungistatic, would allow time for gomesin to act.

to evaluate whether gomesin could be used as a therapeutic treatment for c. albicans infection, we performed blood analyses to determine the toxicity of gomesin in mice. no difference in the total number of leukocytes was observed in animals treated with gomesin. however, the number of eosinophils in mice not infected with candida albicans but treated with gomesin was higher than the control group. the eosinophilia caused by gomesin may be due to the induction of an allergic response. further experiments are needed in order to evaluate this effect. we have also noticed that gomesin treatment leads to a higher number of neutrophils. this effect might be a consequence of the induction of the pro-inflammatory response by gomesin, which would stimulate the bone marrow to recruit neutrophils. however it is not currently known if these cells are being recruited to the site of infection.

in addition, gomesin did not change the haemoglobin levels, which suggests that this peptide was not toxic to erythrocytes. however, the quantity of reticulocytes is greater in treated animals, suggesting that the peptide provokes an erythropoiesis compared to control animals . perhaps treatment with gomesin causes hypoxia in animals, thus increasing erythropoietin  <cit> . furthermore, gomesin was not nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic, as the bilirubin, creatinine, and gamma gt levels from treated animals are similar to the control group. therefore, gomesin seems to be non-toxic to mice.

in addition to the evaluation of toxicity, the biodistribution of gomesin was performed to understand its pharmacokinetics and therefore its therapeutic potential. the biodistribution data revealed that the peptide mainly accumulates in the liver, although it also accumulates in the kidneys and spleen, within the first several minutes after administration. this suggests a rapid clearance from the circulation. the presence of gomesin in the sites of infection might explain the reduction of candida albicans observed in our experiments. however, other studies are needed to monitor the excretion of the peptide.

CONCLUSIONS
gomesin was effective against candida albicans infection in vitro and in vivo. gomesin can be used as an alternative treatment for candidiasis, either alone or in combination with fluconazole. although the mechanism of action of gomesin is not fully understood, it has been suggested that it directly acts on the fungal membrane and/or stimulates the immune response against yeast infection. data presented in this study reinforces the potential of gomesin as a therapeutic antifungal agent in both humans and animals.
