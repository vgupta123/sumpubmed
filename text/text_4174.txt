BACKGROUND
opium poppy  remains our most important source for several pharmaceutical benzylisoquinoline alkaloids  including the narcotic analgesic morphine, the anti-tussive drug codeine, the vasodilator papaverine and the antimicrobial agent sanguinarine. in opium poppy plants, most bias  occur in the cytoplasm  of specialized cells, known as laticifers, that are associated with the phloem in all organs. although latex and, thus, most bias are most abundant on shoot organs of opium poppy, the antimicrobial alkaloid sanguinarine accumulates constitutively in roots possibly in association with cell types other than laticifers. although opium poppy cell cultures do not produce bias constitutively, the biosynthesis of sanguinarine is induced in response to treatment of the cells with a fungal elicitor. as such, opium poppy cell cultures provide an effective model system to investigate the inducible regulation of bia metabolism and other plant defense pathways. the induction of sanguinarine biosynthesis and supporting metabolism in elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures has been characterized using a variety of technologies including est and species-specific microarray analyses to analyze the transcriptome  <cit> , lc-ms/ms to survey the proteome  <cit> , and fourier-transform ion-cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry  to profile the metabolome  <cit> . although these studies provided valuable insights into the response of opium poppy cell cultures to fungal elicitor treatment, the technologies used to generate the various databases were limited in terms of the depth of penetration into the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the cultured cells. for example, lc-ms/ms peptide analysis of  <dig> spots isolated by two-dimensional sds-page led to the identification of  <dig> proteins using a combination of public and species-specific sequence databases. more extensive genomics resources for opium poppy would improve the downstream identification and discovery of enzymes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis. new sequencing technologies such as  <dig> pyrosequencing, and advances in lc-ms/ms-based proteomics and bioinformatics, will expand the application of genomics methodologies to a vast array of non-model plants that produce interesting and valuable metabolites.

the biosynthesis of bias in opium poppy starts with the condensation of two tyrosine derivatives, dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde , by norcoclaurine synthase  to yield -norcoclaurine   <cit> . the formation of dopamine involves the decarboxylation of tyrosine and/or dihydrophenylalanine  by tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase   <cit> . -norcoclaurine is then methylated by the norcoclaurine 6-o-methyltransferase  and coclaurine n-methyltransferase  to yield -methylcoclaurine  <cit> . the p450-dependent monooxygenase -n-methylcoclaurine-3'-hydroxylase  catalyzes the 3'-hydroxylation of -n-methylcoclaurine prior to the formation of -reticuline by the 3'-hydroxy-n-methylcoclaurine 4'-o-methyltransferase   <cit> . -reticuline is the central intermediate in the biosynthesis of most bia structural types including morphinans , benzophenanthridines  and substituted benzylisoquinolines  .

the berberine bridge enzyme  converts -reticuline to -scoulerine as the first committed step in sanguinarine biosynthesis   <cit> . two p450-dependent enzymes, cheilanthifoline synthase  and the stylopine synthase , catalyze the formation of two methylenedioxy bridges and yield -stylopine  <cit> . subsequently, tetrahydroprotoberberine cis-n-methyltransferase  converts -stylopine to -cis-n-methylstylopine  <cit> . two additional p450-dependent enzymes, n-methylstylopine 14-hydroxylase   <cit>  and protopine 6-hydroxylase  are responsible for the conversion of -cis-n-methylstylopine to 6-hydroxyprotopine, which spontaneously rearranges to yield dihydrosanguinarine  <cit> . finally, dihydrosanguinarine is oxidized to sanguinarine by the oxygen-dependent oxidoreductase dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase   <cit> . the biosynthesis of morphine involves the epimerization of -reticuline to -reticuline followed by a series of c-c phenol coupling, two reductions, o-acetylation and two o-demethylations  <cit> . reticuline 7-o-methyltransferase  converts -reticuline to -laudanine  <cit> , whereas norreticuline 7-o-methyltransferase  yields norlaudanine from norreticuline  <cit>  . cognate cdnas have been reported for all of the aforementioned enzymes with the exception of msh, p6h and dbox.

the standard approach to establish genomics resources for non-model plant species involves the random generation of expressed sequence tags  from a cdna phagemid library using dideoxy chain-termination  sequencing technology. next-generation technologies, such as  <dig> pyrosequencing, have the potential to dramatically increase the availability of sequence data  <cit> . the redundancy and depth of coverage of  <dig> pyrosequencing also provides and unbiased representation of transcript abundance, which is useful for relative gene expression analysis especially in non-model plants that lack complete genome sequence information  <cit> . however, despite the fundamental importance of transcriptome analysis in genomics-based research, the frequent incongruity between steady-state protein levels and the abundance of cognate gene transcripts  <cit>  is crucial to the interpretation of relative gene expression profiles in the context of systems biology or gene discovery applications. complementary analysis of the most abundant proteins combined with a comprehensive transcriptome database provides an important validation tool for the relative importance of gene transcripts within a given cell, tissue or organ. transcript and protein sequence databases have recently been reported for opium poppy cell cultures using sanger sequencing of randomly selected cdnas and first-generation lc-ms/ms analysis of proteins isolated by two-dimensional sds-page  <cit> . in terms of the components of sanguinarine metabolism, transcripts corresponding to all known biosynthetic genes were present in the est database, although some were represented by relatively few sequence reads. combined with a low-throughput two-dimensional sampling approach the limited availability of sequence data more severely hampered the identification of known sanguinarine biosynthetic enzymes using lc-ms/ms analysis, which yielded only 6omt  <cit> .

we report the integration of next-generation  <dig> pyrosequencing and advanced lc-ms/ms analysis to establish a deep survey of the transcriptome and proteome of opium poppy cell cultures in response to treatment with a fungal elicitor. the effectiveness of  <dig> pyrosequencing is compared to standard sanger sequencing with respect to depth of penetration into the transcriptome of elicitor-treated opium poppy cells. use of the enhanced est database for the identification of corresponding peptide sequences obtained by one-dimensional sds-page and lc-ms/ms peptide analysis facilitated the identification of more than  <dig>  peptides and polypeptides. most of the known enzymes involved in sanguinarine biosynthesis and many components of primary metabolic pathways that support alkaloid production are present in the protein database. several candidate proteins and transcripts that potentially represent novel biosynthetic enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sanguinarine and other bias are also represented.

RESULTS
induction of sanguinarine accumulation in opium poppy cell cultures
the content of reticuline, protopine and sanguinarine were determined at several time points after elicitor treatment of opium poppy cell cultures to facilitate a correlation of the occurrence of specific transcript and proteins with the abundance of intermediate and end-product alkaloids . reticuline was detected at low levels over the entire time course, but the levels of this central pathway intermediate decreased beginning  <dig> h after elicitor treatment. protopine and sanguinarine were not detected at early time points after elicitor treatment, but both accumulated later in the time course. sanguinarine levels began to increase rapidly between  <dig> and  <dig> h after the addition of elicitor, and reach a concentration of more than  <dig> Î¼g/g fresh-weight of cells by the end of the 100-h time course. at  <dig> h post-elicitation, the level of sanguinarine was 40-fold greater than that of reticuline or protopine. an inverse correlation between the levels of reticuline and protopine/sanguinarine was apparent over the duration of the time course.

properties of the transcript database generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing
a total of  <dig>  <dig> high-quality expressed sequence tags  with an average read length of  <dig> bp were generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing of half a plate using gs flx titanium system . the assembly of overlapping sequences yielded a total of  <dig>  unigenes, of which  <dig>   were composed of two or more contiguous ests , whereas  <dig>   consisted of only a single unique sequence  . blastx analysis showed that these unigenes could be classified into two groups. the first group contained  <dig>   unigenes that displayed similarity to known genes . the second group consisted of  <dig>   unigenes that showed no similarity with any gene in the public uniprot database. unigenes in the latter group could represent previously uncharacterized or unknown genes, sequences specific to opium poppy, or gene fragments that are too short to annotate.

***blastx search of the uniprot plants v <dig>  database 

the discovery rate of new unigenes reach saturation after approximately  <dig>  pyrosequencing reads suggesting that near-complete representation of the elicitor-treated opium poppy cell culture transcriptome was achieved . the majority of unigenes were between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length and although the percentage of unigenes longer than  <dig> bp was considerably lower,  <dig>  contigs showed greater than 90% coverage of predicted open reading frames among known genes identified by blastx analysis . errors in sequencing and the assembly of contigs could have resulted in the apparently low representation of full-length transcripts. the possibility that greater overall sequence coverage was present in the database is supported by the frequent occurrence of several independent unigenes encoding the same gene product. for example, opium poppy tnmt was represented by  <dig> unigenes . the most abundant of these unigenes  was assembled from  <dig> independent  <dig> pyrosequencing reads and, although it covered the entire open reading frame encoding tnmt, the predicted protein showed only 96% amino acid identity compared with the published sequence   <cit> . two other independent unigenes  displayed 100% amino acid sequence identity with respect to the published sequence, but did not show complete open reading frame coverage. the multiple contigs likely represent different tnmt isoforms of independent genes expressed in elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures. alternatively, the large number of unigenes might reflect sequencing and/or assembly errors.

an anticipated feature of the est database is the substantially greater coverage of the 3'-ends of several contigs resulting from  the proportionately larger number of partial cdnas in the library and  the relative inefficiency of shearing short cdnas prior to  <dig> pyrosequencing . in most cases and as demonstrated for tnmt , relatively few unigenes were assembled from the majority of sequence reads corresponding to the same gene product. taking this into account, the gene density of opium poppy can be estimated by only dividing the number of contigs  by the size of the opium poppy genome, estimated at  <dig>  mbp  <cit> , which yields a gene density of approximately  <dig> genes per mbp.

deep transcriptome analysis of elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures
the large number of reads generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing allows a robust comparison of the relative expression of different genes. moreover, the saturation of newly discovered unigenes after the analysis of approximately  <dig>  ests  suggests near-complete coverage of the elicitor-treated opium poppy cell culture transcriptome. however, accurate identification of each est is essential to facilitate the quantification of all reads corresponding to selected genes. the unigenes were mapped to uniprot version  <dig>   using blastx analysis with an expectation highly expressed value of e < 10- <dig> included in the high-scoring segment pair. the  <dig> most abundant unigenes represented in the transcriptome accounted for approximately 9% of the transcriptome . the single most abundant transcript was sampled  <dig>  times and annotated as a senescence-associated protein, a putative cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase, from pea. the remaining top- <dig> most highly represented transcripts were sampled between  <dig>  and  <dig> times and encode proteins involved in metabolism, defense, signaling, transport and cellular structure . transcripts encoding several enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of s-adenosylmethionine  such as sam synthetase, s-adenosylhomocyteinase, and methionine synthase were highly represented in the database. abundant transcripts encoding defense-response proteins encoded chitinase, Î²-lactamase, polyphenol oxidase, xyloglucanase inhibitor, peroxidase, and pathogenesis-related  proteins. transcripts encoding components of the proteosome and polyubiquitin, along with several housekeeping proteins including an elongation factor, ubiquitin and ribosomal proteins were also abundant. most importantly, six of the top- <dig> most abundant transcripts encoded known enzymes involved in sanguinarine biosynthesis: ncs, cnmt, bbe, stysyn and two putative tnmt isoforms .

* refers to a measure of similarity between a previously characterized protein with the listed annotation and an amino acid sequence translated from the contig. a high score indicates substantial amino acid identity between the two proteins.

local blastx analysis was performed to identify ests encoding all known bia biosynthetic enzymes . in the pathway from tyrosine to -reticuline , sequence reads corresponding to known enzymes were relatively abundant with cnmt showing the highest transcript level and the p450-dependent enzyme nmch displaying the lowest transcript abundance . several unigenes showed less than 90% amino acid sequence identity compared with 6omt and 4'omt suggesting that the corresponding transcripts encode o-methyltransferases that potentially accept bia substrates other than norcoclaurine and 3'-hydroxy-n-methylcoclaurine, respectively. in the branch pathway from -reticuline to sanguinarine, sequence reads encoding known enzymes were similarly abundant with the p450-dependent enzymes chesyn and stysyn showing the lowest transcript levels. it should be noted that the transcript levels shown in figure  <dig> reflect the total of all putative isoforms ; thus, individual ncs, cnmt, bbe, stysyn and tnmt unigenes were assembled from the largest number of sequence reads  although the total number of ests corresponding to all putative isoforms was higher for certain other enzymes . for example, no individual unigenes encoding tydc were found among the  <dig> most abundant transcripts  although the total number of reads for all unigenes encoding tydc was substantial suggesting the occurrence of several different isoforms . unigenes encoding chesyn and stysyn were identified on the basis of their similarity to characterized cdnas from eschscholzia californica <cit>  and their sequences have been deposited in genbank accession numbers gu <dig> and gu <dig> respectively.

transcripts encoding three out of six known enzymes involved in the conversion of -reticuline to morphine were not detected in the database, with ests corresponding to the other three enzymes represented at substantially lower levels than enzymes involved in sanguinarine biosynthesis . similarly, transcripts encoding two other known bia biosynthetic enzymes from opium poppy were represented at low levels  or were not found in the database . the failure of elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures to express genes encoding salsyn, salr and codm explains the absence of morphine in dedifferentiated cells. it is notable that all unigenes encoding enzymes involved in sanguinarine biosynthesis displayed full-length open reading frames, which further supports the depth of transcriptome coverage that is possible using  <dig> pyrosequencing.

deep proteome analysis of elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures
a total protein extract from elicitor-treated opium poppy cells was fractionated by one-dimensional sds-page and the gel was cut into  <dig> equal-sized fragments . proteins in each gel slice were digested with trypsin and subjected to lc-ms/ms. peptide fragment spectra were used to search both the public ncbi non-redundant green plant protein database and the opium poppy database created by  <dig> pyrosequencing. using a stringent cut-off,  <dig> peptides and polypeptides were identified using the public protein database, of which  <dig> were represented by two or more peptides. in contrast,  <dig>  peptides and polypeptides were identified using the opium poppy-specific  <dig> pyrosequencing database, of which  <dig> were represented by two or more peptides . the species-specificity and depth of coverage offered by the  <dig> pyrosequencing database added substantial identification power to the analysis.

annotated unigenes in the  <dig> pyrosequencing database and proteins identified by lc-ms/ms peptide analysis were classified into functional categories based on their putative roles in cellular processes . putative go annotations could be assigned to 72% of the peptides and polypeptides with corresponding ests, whereas the remaining 28% belong to unknown, uncategorized and no hit categories . the most abundant category  represented 23% of all identified proteins and included enzymes involved in primary metabolism, such as sam synthetase, methionine synthase and enzymes involved in central metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle . a number of peptides and polypeptides  were associated with protein synthesis and modification suggesting a substantial role for these processes in elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures . chaperones and heat shock proteins , defense proteins  and proteins involved in protein turnover  were also well represented. almost all enzymes involved in bia biosynthesis that were represented in the  <dig> pyrosequencing database were identified by lc-ms/ms peptide analysis , including ncs, 6omt, cnmt, nmch, 4'omt, bbe, stysyn, and tnmt. the morphine biosynthetic enzyme cor <dig> was also identified. interestingly, tydc and chesyn were not identified despite similar transcript levels compared with other soluble and p450-dependent enzymes, respectively .

integration of transcriptome and proteome databases
a broad survey of cellular metabolism involved in the conversion of sucrose to sanguinarine resulted in the identification of transcripts or proteins corresponding to a substantial number of metabolic enzymes . with the exception of 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, all enzymes required for the formation of tyrosine and sam were represented in the  <dig> pyrosequencing database, whereas  <dig> out of  <dig> enzymes were found in the lc-ms/ms-generated protein database . many of these enzymes were also among the top- <dig> most abundant unigenes . notably, four independent unigenes in the top  <dig> encoded enzymes involved in the metabolism of sam, the methyl donor for the various o-and n-methyltransferases in bia biosynthesis.

the remaining sanguinarine biosynthetic enzymes for which cognate cdnas have not been isolated catalyze three of the four steps involved in the formation of dopamine and 4-hpaa, and the final three conversions from -cis-n-methylstylopine to sanguinarine . some of these enzymes likely belong to known protein families including the cytochromes p <dig> msh and p6h  <cit>  and the oxidoreductase dbox  <cit> . candidate proteins with substantial identity to oxidoreductase and other enzyme categories potentially involved in bia metabolism were found in the lc-ms/ms-generated peptide and polypeptide database .

discussion
integration of  <dig> pyrosequencing and lc-ms/ms peptide analysis were used to survey the transcriptome and proteome, respectively, of elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures. the depth of each database provides new insights into the regulation of bia metabolism and plant defense responses, establishes valuable resources for the discovery of new alkaloid biosynthetic genes, and allows an assessment of next-generation-omics technologies as tools to study natural product biosynthesis in plants that currently lack genome sequence resources  <cit> .

treatment of cell cultures with the elicitor for  <dig> and  <dig> h maximized the accumulation of bia biosynthetic gene transcripts and cognate enzymes, respectively. using microarray and northern blot analyses, the maximum induction of bia biosynthetic genes was previously shown to occur  <dig> h after the elicitor treatment of opium poppy cell cultures  <cit> . corresponding western blot analysis showed that bia biosynthetic enzyme levels were highest  <dig> h after elicitor treatment  <cit> . the elicitor-induced accumulation profiles of protopine and sanguinarine  were in agreement with the temporal induction of bia products and pathway intermediates determined using ft-icr-ms  <cit> .

the est database generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing was compared with that established by random sequencing of clones from an elicitor-treated opium poppy cell culture cdna library using dideoxy chain-termination  technology  <cit> . although the average read length produced by  <dig> pyrosequencing was less than that of sanger-based sequencing , substantially more ests were generated , which led to the acquisition of a large number of additional unigenes . the most abundant transcripts in the  <dig> pyrosequencing database encoded enzymes and proteins involved in metabolism, defense, signaling, transport and cellular structure . transcripts encoding biosynthetic enzymes involved in the regeneration of -adenosylmethionine  were among the most abundant in the database, which is in agreement with their widespread occurrence in an est database generated by sanger sequencing  <cit> .

an est database was established using  <dig> pyrosequencing to investigate the flavonoid pathway in the chinese medicinal plant epimedium sagittatum <cit> . a total of  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> bp were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes consisting of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. similarly,  <dig> pyrosequencing of cdna obtained from the glandular trichomes of artemisia annua, which produces the antimalarial sesquiterpene artemisinin, yielded  <dig>  reads with and average length of  <dig> bp asembling into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons  <cit> . real time-pcr confirmed the expression of all known terpenoid biosynthetic genes and revealed several novel gene transcripts in the  <dig> pyrosequencing database including putative sesquiterpene synthase homologues. our opium poppy cell culture library is comparable or superior to these reported databases in terms of sequence coverage . the large number singletons in the opium poppy cell culture database was also reported in the other systems and might result from assembly errors due or from the occurrence of low abundance transcripts. as shown for tnmt  several unigenes were found for most bia biosynthetic enzymes , which could reflect the occurrence of multiple gene family members. separate unigenes encoding proteins with 100% amino acid identity could also result from the improper assembly of contigs . clearly, the reported  <dig>  unigenes is a substantial overestimate of the actual number of transcripts expressed in those cells. the lack of assembly potentially caused by sequencing errors could account for the high number of orphaned ests, although some could represent low-expression level genes.

our  <dig> pyrosequencing reads showed a substantial bias for the 3'-end of gene transcripts most likely due to the priming of the first-strand cdna synthesis using oligo-dt . moreover, the nebulization of relatively short, partial cdnas process was also inefficient . comparison of  <dig> pyrosequencing using california poppy  cdna libraries prepared using oligo-dt or random-primers confirmed that the 3'-end bias resulted from priming first-strand cdna synthesis with oligo-dt  <cit> . assembly of both the oligo-dt and random-primed ests generated from two full plate of gs-flx  <dig> pyrosequencing resulted in  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp which assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons  <cit> . many of the partial ests are also truncated at common points at their 5'-end . genomic  <dig> pyrosequencing of escherichia coli showed that 80% of single nucleotide polymorphisms were falsely linked to reads having the same starting point  <cit> . the high number of replicate sequences suggested that the phenomenon was not random and was associated with the emulsion pcr step and not with nebulization. similar artefacts were also reported in a metagenomics study on several species, which found systematic errors in genomes sequenced by  <dig> pyrosequencing technologies   <cit> . multiple reads from a single template were suggested to occur when amplified dna attaches to empty beads during emulsion pcr. although duplicate sequences are occasionally removed prior to assembly, clearly some are still present in our database .

since the number of  <dig> pyrosequencing reads in each contig is directly proportional to the abundance of specific cdnas in the library, quantification of the data provides an accurate measure of the relative expression level of selected transcripts. comparisons of  <dig> pyrosequencing and hybridization-based gene expression analyses  have shown reproducible correlations  <cit> . the induction of all known genes encoding bia biosynthetic enzymes involved in the formation of sanguinarine has been shown previously  <cit> . however,  <dig> pyrosequencing provides the ability to quantify the relative abundance of different gene transcripts . in the conversion of tyrosine to sanguinarine , <dig> pyrosequencing reads encoding cnmt and tnmt were most abundant and were represented among the top- <dig> most highly expressed unigenes . in contrast, reads corresponding to the p450-dependent enzymes nmch, chesyn and stysyn were the least abundant . overall, elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures show a strong commitment to sanguinarine biosynthesis as demonstrated by the cumulative abundance of  <dig> pyrosequencing reads corresponding to genes involved in sanguinarine biosynthesis in agreement with previously published reports comparing control and elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures  <cit> . the total number of reads  with greater than 90% amino acid identity to all known bia biosynthetic enzymes represent approximately  <dig> % of the transcriptome. of these,  <dig> % encoded enzymes leading to -reticuline,  <dig> % corresponded to enzymes involved in the conversion of -reticuline to sanguinarine,  <dig> % represented enzymes in the morphinan alkaloid branch pathway, and  <dig> % were relevant to the formation of other bias, such as laudanine . the absence of any  <dig> pyrosequncing reads corresponding to three  out of the six enzymes leading from -salutaridine to morphine explains the lack of codeine or morphine in elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures . interestingly, genes encoding other known biosynthetic enzymes in the morphinan alkaloid branch pathway  were expressed, albeit at low levels compared with those involved in the formation of -reticuline or sanguinarine . dna microarray and northern blot analyses have previously shown that salat mrna levels were induced in opium poppy cell cultures in response to elicitor treatment, whereas cor transcripts are constitutive  <cit> . moreover, the recently identified t6odm cdna was represented in a sanger-based opium poppy cell culture est database, whereas the codm was only found in an opium poppy stem est database  <cit> . the differential expression of genes encoding morphinan biosynthetic enzymes in elicitor-treated opium poppy cells could reflect a requirement for specific cellular or developmental conditions not present in dedifferentiated cell cultures  <cit> .

two-dimensional  sds-page is the most commonly used method to separate proteins for plant proteomics applications. however, penetration into the proteome is limited owing mostly to low abundance proteins that are difficult isolate from the 2d gel. our previous application of lc-ms/ms to analyze the proteome of elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures resulted in the identification of  <dig> proteins based on peptide fragment fingerprint searches using a combination of public and opium poppy est  databases  <cit> . a total of  <dig> spots were isolated by 2d sds-page and 6omt was the only bia biosynthetic enzyme represented among the identified proteins  <cit> . recently, the mass spectral analysis of proteins partially separated by one-dimensional sds-page was used to assemble an impressive proteome map for arabidopsis thaliana for different organs, developmental stages, and undifferentiated cultured cells  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  peptide matches yielded  <dig>  identified proteins. proteomics in many plants is typically forced to rely on cross-species identification owing to the lack of genome or transcriptome sequence information, which leads to relatively low numbers of unambiguously identified proteins and the potential for false-positive identification. for example, proteome analysis of banana, which is distantly related to most plant species with substantial dna sequence data, was used to compare various protein extraction methods and one-dimensional versus 2d sds-page techniques within the context of cross-species matching of peptide mass spectra. one-dimensional sds-page on proteins extracted in chloroform:methanol  followed by lc-ms/ms facilitated the identification of the most proteins, including several hydrophobic proteins that were underrepresented when 2d sds-page was used  <cit> .

our one-dimensional sds-page, lc-ms/ms proteomics approach coupled with the unambiguous identification of peptide spectra using an extensive opium poppy est database generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing led to the identification of five-fold more peptides and polypeptides  than our previous effort  <cit> . most identified proteins are involved in metabolism, defense, signalling, transport and cellular structure . the majority of identified transcripts  and proteins  are involved in metabolism and include enzymes of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and intermediary metabolic enzymes, such as sam synthetase and methionine synthase . almost all enzymes involved in bia biosynthesis were identified by lc-ms/ms peptide analysis . since the likelihood of identifying a certain protein is proportional to the abundance of specific peptides, the absence of tydc in the identified protein list  could be due to the large number of isoforms encoded by the approximately 15-member tydc gene family  <cit> . alternatively, the absence of tydc in the identified protein list  could result from issues related to solubility, extraction efficiency, digestion, or the nature of peptide sequences.

with one exception , transcripts encoding all enzymes required for the formation of tyrosine and sam were represented in the est database  and several were also among the  <dig> most abundant unigenes . similarly, many of these enzymes were also found in the protein database . altogether these results further demonstrate the metabolic commitment of elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures to the overall biosynthesis of sanguinarine.

based on the abundance of characterized mrnas and enzymes involved in bia metabolism, the remaining components of sanguinarine biosynthesis for which cognate cdnas have not been isolated should be represented in the transcript and protein databases at similar levels. the penultimate and third-to-last enzymes in sanguinarine biosynthesis, which catalyze the conversion of -cis-n-methylstylopine to dehydrosanguinarine , are cytochromes p <dig>  <cit> . although the transcript database contains numerous sequences that annotated as cytochromes p <dig>  a more focused number of candidate cytochromes p <dig> were represented in the protein database . cytochromes p <dig> represented in the  <dig> pyrosequencing database at levels similar to transcripts encoding nmch, chesyn and stysyn coupled with the corresponding representation of the cognate enzymes in the lc-ms/ms protein database provides a basis for the selection of genes putatively involved in bia biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the integration of state-of-the-art  <dig> gs-flx titanium pyrosequencing and lc-ms/ms-based protein profiling technologies is an effective strategy to establish deep transcriptome and proteome databases for the investigation of natural product metabolism in non-model plant systems. a near-complete transcriptome from relatively homogenous, elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures could be achieved by the assembly of fewer than one-half million  <dig> pyrosequencing reads using the gs-flx titanium technology. all known sanguinarine biosynthetic gene transcripts were represented in the database, along with a multitude of transcripts encoding primary and intermediary metabolic enzymes providing precursors and co-substrates in support of alkaloid production. the absence of several transcripts encoding morphinan alkaloid biosynthetic enzymes reveals the transcriptional basis for the lack of morphine production in dedifferentiated opium poppy cell cultures. the establishment of tandem mass spectra derived from predicted peptides represented in the deep transcript database facilitated the empirical identification of a large number of corresponding proteins fractionated by one-dimensional sds-page. the depth of proteome coverage was dramatically greater than that achieved using 2d sds-page to isolate individual proteins base on the representation of most sanguinarine biosynthetic enzymes and a substantial number of metabolic enzymes relevant to bia metabolism. the integration of a near-complete and species-specific transcript database was crucial to the successful identification of multiple peptides. profiling of the more abundant proteins in elicitor-treated opium poppy cell cultures also revealed a number of uncharacterized enzymes that potentially catalyze steps in sanguinarine biosynthesis.
