BACKGROUND
gene regulation has been the subject of intense investigation over the past decades, mainly focusing on detailed characterization of a particular gene or gene family. however, genome-wide mapping of protein-dna interactions and epigenetic marks is essential for a full understanding of transcriptional regulation. a precise map of binding sites for transcription factors , core transcriptional machinery, and other dna-binding proteins is necessary to decode the gene regulatory networks and their contribution to developmental processes and human disease  <cit> . in fact, regulation of gene expression by tfs is one of the major mechanisms for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and function.

to elucidate the mechanism operating in the establishment and maintenance of cell-specific differentiation, we used thyroid epithelial cells as a model system. these cells are the largest cell population of the thyroid gland and express different tfs called nkx <dig> , foxe <dig>  hhex and pax <dig>  which define the thyroid differentiated phenotype  <cit> . it is well known that these factors bind to the promoter regions of thyroid-specific genes, such as the genes encoding thyroglobulin , thyroperoxidase , and the sodium iodide symporter , thus regulating their expression. nevertheless, despite the key relevance of these tfs for thyroid biology, few studies have described additional loci that are transcriptionally regulated by the above mentioned tfs, nor have sequences been described to which these factors bind in enhancers, silencers, or boundary elements that could potentially regulate the transcription of genes over large distances.

among these thyroid tfs, pax <dig> is a member of the paired box-containing proteins and is expressed in the thyroid and kidney, and in the central nervous system during development  <cit> . it plays an essential role in the differentiation of thyroid cells and, according to the phenotype of pax <dig> knockout mice, it seems to be responsible for the formation of the follicles of polarized epithelial thyroid cells  <cit> . also, the association between mutations of pax <dig> and congenital hypothyroidism in humans underlines an important function of this transcription factor in thyroid pathologies  <cit> . in order to better understand its role in the maintenance of thyroid function, we explored the transcriptional profile of pax8-silenced thyroid cells, and integrated these signals with global cis-regulatory sequencing studies .

the chip-seq strategy allowed us to identify a large number of novel in vivo pax <dig> binding sites that were significantly associated with cpg islands or high gc content sequences. interestingly, immunoprecipitated peaks were mainly located along intronic regions and grouped in distal positions with respect to transcriptional start sites. consensus sequence screening of these areas suggested pax <dig> interaction with several core transcriptional elements , transcription factors belonging to the ap <dig> family, and trans-elements factors involved in high order chromatin structure  and remodeling . co-immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated both physical binding and transcriptional cooperation between ctcf/sp <dig> and pax <dig>  combining sequencing and expression array data, we ultimately provided insights into pax8-transcriptional networks in the differentiated thyroid that predict its involvement in relevant biological processes and pathways.

RESULTS
genomic features associated with pax <dig> binding sites
in order to identify the genome-wide binding patterns of pax <dig> in differentiated thyroid cells, we performed chip-seq in pccl <dig> rat thyrocytes using ip and non-ip conditions. prior to massive sequencing, both conditions were interrogated to verify pax <dig> binding site enrichment by means of semi-quantitative pcr . using this approach, we confirmed dna immunoprecipitation of pax <dig> binding regions in the rat nis and tpo promoters , as previously described  <cit> . therefore, we considered both ip and non-ip conditions as useful samples to further identify whole genome pax <dig> binding sites by means of high throughput sequencing technology. after sequencing analysis, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads for control and ip conditions, respectively. of these,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  fulfilled the ≤ <dig> mismatches quality filter.

to further localize regions of pax <dig> enrichment, we identified pax <dig> peaks genome-wide. peak detection analysis using macs defined  <dig>  pax8-enriched regions with an average length of 681 bp . visual inspection of the pax <dig> binding sites and the profiling data in a genome browser for well-known pax <dig> targets like nis, tpo,  <cit>  and wt <dig>   <cit> , showed pax <dig> binding sites close to the 5'-utrs of these genes as previously described. a detailed analysis of nis , whose transcription status is tightly regulated by pax <dig>  <cit> , showed a significant pax <dig> binding site overlapping with the nis upstream enhancer . these findings clearly validated chip-seq as an efficient and powerful technique for mapping pax <dig> binding sites in pccl <dig> cells.

association of pax <dig> enriched regions with annotated genomic features indicated that pax <dig> tends to localize within intronic regions ; only a few peaks revealed binding to coding  or 5'-utr regulatory regions  . in addition, pax <dig> binding sites showed preferential binding to regions located 10-100 kb upstream or downstream of the closest transcription start site . we also assessed the general sequence content of these peaks, including cg content and dinucleotide frequencies. we found a clearly increased correlation between pax <dig> binding sites and cpg islands  and cg simple repeat elements  in comparison with other dinucleotide combinations throughout the rat genome . all these data suggest preferential pax <dig> interaction with “orphan” cgis, cg-rich intragenic elements not associated to 5'-utr regions  <cit> .

pax <dig> immunoprecipitated regions delineate pax <dig> consensus core sequence in vivo
we considered the most significant pax <dig> peaks  to evaluate how efficiently chip immunoprecipitated the pax8-dna binding sequence. among the most significant consensus motifs obtained using the meme-chip and tomtom in silico tools, we observed a significant overrepresentation of pax-related binding sites, including sites for pax <dig> and members of its own subfamily  . the pax <dig> binding motif here defined encompasses motifs obtained by individual-gene based approaches, such as those defined for rat and human tpo <cit>  and for the rat nis upstream enhancer  <cit>  , as well as those defined by in vitro studies outlining the binding sequence for pax <dig>  <cit>  and the pax2/5/ <dig> subfamily   <cit> . of note, our study is the first to describe the in vivo pax <dig> binding sequence derived from its dna binding along the whole rat genome.

immunoprecipitation data reveals interaction of pax <dig> with various tfs
to identify possible interactions between pax <dig> and other tfs, genomatix suite screening was performed to identify the most over-represented motifs in the pax <dig> binding regions identified by macs  <cit> . overrepresented consensus motifs in pax <dig> peaks, as well as fold change and z-score values are shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  these analyses showed an overrepresentation of the pax <dig>  and pax <dig> consensus motifs  with a modest association for pax <dig> . these results may be explained by the dna binding similarities among members of the same pax subfamily .

the overrep.  column represents the fold overrepresentation of these matrices in our ip peaks compared to their presence in the rat genome, and the z-score  column indicates association value between the dna matrices and pax8-immunoprecipitated dna.

in agreement with previous reports describing interactions between members of the pax family and ap <dig> factors  <cit> , we also observed enrichment of transcription factors belonging to this latter family . intriguingly, several transcription factor matrices  and general transcriptional regulatory elements ) showed significant association with pax <dig> ip peaks . in order to rule out any nonspecific effect of the pax <dig> antibody on the recognition of these transcription factors not related to pax <dig>  we compared their amino acid sequences with the pax <dig> protein by means of the dnastar alignment program. no significant similarities were observed among the considered proteins, thus ruling out any unspecific binding of the pax <dig> antibody . as shown in their corresponding ip genomatix motifs , all these transcription factors preferentially bind to regions with high gc content, which could be related to the association of pax <dig> to cpg islands and cg repeats.

to validate the interactions between pax <dig> and the tfs described before, we performed co-immuprecipitation assays in pccl <dig> cells using specific antibodies for pax <dig>  sp <dig> and ctcf. as shown in figure 5a, both ctcf and sp <dig> coprecipitate with pax <dig>  confirming physical binding among these transcription factors in vivo and suggesting the existence of common transcriptionally regulated targets. given that the nis promoter region conferring regulation by pax <dig>  overlapped with potential sites for both transcription regulators , we performed transfection experiments in hela cells using a reporter construct containing the nis promoter  <cit> . as shown in figure 5b, sp <dig> strikingly increased nis transcriptional activity, while cotransfection of pax <dig> and sp <dig> resulted in a synergestic effect on promoter activation. on the other hand, contransfection with ctcf induced a statistically significant decrease in transcription . these data unequivocally demonstrate a functional cooperation between pax <dig> and sp <dig> and ctcf in transcriptional regulation.

expression arrays analysis identifies a wide set of loci regulated by pax8
we used whole genome expression arrays to identify pax8-regulated genes by comparing expression profiles of pax8-silenced pccl <dig> cells with both scrambled sirna-treated and wild type  pccl <dig> cells. this last condition was included to consistently integrate both expression array signals and global cis-regulatory sequencing studies into the same experimental conditions. misinterpretation of expression data due to compensatory effects via pax8-related paralogues  is ruled out, given that both transcription factors are not expressed in thyroid cells.

regarding the comparison of sipax8-pccl <dig> vs. wt pccl <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  probes were down and up-regulated in the pax8-silenced condition, respectively . a lower number of significant probes was detected for sipax8-pccl <dig> vs. siscramble-pccl <dig>  . statistically significantly differently expressed probes  for both comparisons included  <dig> down and  <dig> up-regulated targets , which represent a set of  <dig> loci.

pax <dig> is involved in controlling key cellular events
gene lists were ranked based on t-statistics for gene set enrichment analysis. the most significant go terms and adjusted p-values for both array comparisons are shown in table  <dig>  and more detailed data, including genes belonging to each significant category, are listed in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in general, the fatiscan tool revealed significant association for biological processes related to immune response, molecule transport, response to stimuli, cell motion/adhesion, cell proliferation, and translational processes. in relation to this last term, ribosome-related go classes were also observed for other fatiscan categories: molecular processes , kegg pathway , and cell component analysis  .

single functional analysis
we additionally used the fatigo in silico tool to extract gene ontology  terms overrepresented in our down- and up-regulated set of differentially expressed genes. considering down-regulated probes for each comparison, we observed an enrichment in biological processes related to a wide variety of dna, rna, and protein processes , cell response to chemical and stress stimuli, immune response, and p <dig> and insulin-related pathways  . concerning go terms enriched amongst up-regulated probes, it is worth to mention the over-representation of genes involved in biological processes such as immune response, cell response to stimuli, apoptosis and cell death, cell motion/migration/adhesion, and regulation of cell differentiation .

integrated data reveal a reduced percentage of genes transcriptionally regulated through promoter sequences
to answer the question whether independent pax <dig> binding to the genomic regions has functional consequences through changes in the expression level of target genes, the chip-seq data were integrated with the gene expression profiling data. as shown in the venn diagram ,  <dig> differentially expressed probes  representing  <dig> loci were associated with genes showing a significant peak around +/− 1 kb from a tss. this number of genes represents  <dig> %  of the significantly associated genes identified by expression arrays . this small overlap can be explained by indirect effects of pax <dig> or by the binding of pax <dig> to “orphan” cgi regulatory elements, also sites of transcriptional initiation but not related with tsss or promoter regions  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that we identified neighbouring genes showing significantly altered expression according to our expression data, which could be simultaneously regulated by a unique pax <dig> binding site; for example, the closely positioned genes padi <dig> and padi <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  and mlph  and rab <dig> on chromosome  <dig> .

independent validation confirms significant findings defined by chip-seq and expression arrays
we performed experimental validations using independent immunoprecipitated and sirna silenced pccl <dig> samples, as well as their corresponding controls. among the genes included for this validation were: brca <dig> , a well-known tumour suppressor gene involved in the maintenance of genomic stability and related to breast carcinoma development  <cit> ; cdh <dig> , a member of the cadherin protein family acting as a morphogenic factor for tissue development  <cit>  and recently described to be regulated by pax <dig>  <cit> ; rab <dig>  and myo5b , genes previously described to be involved in epithelial vesicle trafficking in highly polarized cells  <cit> ; dab2ip , a tumour and metastasis suppressor gene which encodes a ras gtpase-activating protein  <cit> ; dio <dig> , an essential gene for thyroid hormone action given that it codes for an oxidoreductase involved in thyroid hormone activation by converting the prohormone t <dig> into bioactive  <dig> ,3'-triiodothyronine   <cit>  and tmod <dig> , a gene encoding a protein which inhibits actin filament elongation and that is consequently involved in cytoskeleton structure regulation and cell morphology  <cit> . as shown in figure 7a, after pax <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by semiquantitative rt-pcr, we observed an enrichment of ip regions for all the above-mentioned validation targets in comparison with both non-ip samples and input samples.

in addition, pax <dig> silencing by means of transient transfection of sirna was significantly associated with decreased expression levels of these potential targets , thus demonstrating a direct transcriptional effect of pax <dig> on these genes. mrna expression validation was also done for several genes that were upregulated in the absence of pax <dig>  including the genes encoding: ccl <dig>  a chemokine involved in thyroid autoimmunity  <cit> ; s100a <dig>  a calcium-binding protein which plays a role in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling and tumor microenvironment, and reported to be overexpressed in metastatic papillary thyroid microcarcinomas  <cit> ; scnn1g and padi <dig>  which exert a role in na+ transport and differentiation in epithelial cells, respectively  <cit>  . in silico analysis of significant ip peaks located along promoter areas of these loci demonstrated pax <dig> potential binding sites in  <dig> out of  <dig> genes . globally, these findings underscore the efficiency and accuracy of chip-seq and expression array technologies to define a pax8-dependent gene network, which allowed us to identify biological functions of pax <dig> in thyroid cells.

discussion
despite the known relevance of the transcription factor pax <dig> for adult thyrocyte physiology, few data have been published concerning pax <dig> target genes other than key thyroid-related genes . the transcriptional output of pax <dig> during thyroid development is unknown but essential, given that thyroid follicular precursors are not formed in pax <dig> null mouse embryos, which ultimately impairs the formation of follicle structures and thyroid hormone biosynthesis  <cit> .

with regard to its link to tumour development, pax <dig> expression decreases or is lost in follicular thyroid carcinomas as well as in oncogene-transformed thyroid cells  <cit> . moreover, several well-known tumour suppressors, including tp <dig> <cit>  and wt <dig> <cit> , have been defined as pax <dig> targets, and cytoplasmic pax <dig> staining has been positively associated with tumour size, metastasis, local invasion, recurrence, or persistence in the thyroid  <cit> . taking into account all these premises, and in order to better understand the role of pax <dig> in the maintenance of thyroid function, we decided to explore the transcriptional profile of pax8-silenced thyroid pccl <dig> cells, and to integrate these signals with genome wide cis-regulatory studies. thus, our experimental design combined putative and novel pax <dig> binding sites with analysis of actual target gene expression regulation, a strategy successfully used for identifying direct targets for other transcription factors  <cit> .

our unbiased mapping of pax <dig> binding sites along the rat genome has identified a large number of dna sequences that are occupied in living thyrocytes. moreover, this is the first study addressing in vivo genome-wide mapping of pax8-dna binding sites, and the pax <dig> consensus binding motif here defined encompasses motifs described by previous reports focused either on single gene regulation  <cit>  or on paired-box dna motif characterization  <cit> . the chipseq approach also led to significant immunoprecipitation of genomic sequences containing cpg islands, as well as cpg dinucleotides. extensive literature has linked the location of cpg islands and gc-enriched regions to transcriptionally permissive chromatin  <cit> , which could lend support to a relevant role of pax <dig> in the transcriptional output of the thyrocyte. about half of all cpg islands self-evidently contain tsss, while the other half  are either within or between characterized transcription units and have unknown significance  <cit> . despite a lack of association to annotated promoters, “orphan” cpg islands have been associated to transcriptional initiation and dynamic expression during development  <cit> . in agreement with this, we found significant pax <dig> binding to orphan cpg islands in intronic regions and a preferential binding to such islands 10–100 kb upstream or downstream of a transcription start site. in fact, genomic studies indicate that almost half of the human coding genes have alternative promoters  <cit>  and that transcription factor binding sites  in classically defined promoter regions may represent a minority of genomic binding sites  <cit> . moreover, this latter report clearly demonstrated an association between tfbss and the expression of non-coding rnas, which could be modulating the expression of the gene encoded by the opposite strand. less directly, a subset of intergenic h3k4me <dig> peaks, many of which are likely to correspond to orphan cpg islands, were found to represent tsss for long non-coding rnas  <cit> . our findings suggest that pax <dig> binds orphan cpg islands that could represent alternative promoters of nearby annotated genes  <cit>  or ncrnas that regulate gene expression.

otherwise, pax8-dependent chip-seq data demonstrated an enrichment of genomic regions with overrepresentation of general transcriptional regulatory elements . mte constitutes a core promoter element  associated with rna polymerase ii-mediated transcription  <cit> . furthermore, human orphan cpg islands have been associated with rna polymerase ii binding sites  <cit> . on the other hand, inr-dpe and bre elements represent functional binding sites for tfiib and tfiid , which are main components of the basal transcription machinery  <cit> . interestingly, jin et al recently described synergistic mte-inr-bre transcriptional modules in more than  <dig>  orthologous mouse and human genes  <cit> . whereas functional experiments should be performed to demonstrate an interaction of pax <dig> with these general core elements, our data underscore the importance of synergistic interactions between core promoter elements and tissue-specific tfs to ultimately modulate gene expression.

potential pax <dig> partners in transcriptional regulation
2apart from the classical view of tfs interacting with promoter regions, tfs could activate gene expression by interacting with common lineage-specific tfs and/or binding to distal regions . synergistic effects of pax <dig> and ap <dig> proteins have been shown to occur in the regulation of nis transcription through interaction along the nue element  <cit> , and ap <dig> and pax proteins also interact to cooperate in the modulation of transcription of other genes  <cit> . accordingly, we observed an overrepresentation of binding motifs related to nrf- <dig> , and several ap <dig> members  were differentially expressed in pax8-deprived thyroid cells. however, no significant findings were obtained for other transcription factors described to act synergistically with pax <dig>  such as nkx2- <dig> and taz/wwtr <dig> proteins  <cit> , indicating that this cooperative transcriptional role could be restricted to specific loci rather than representing a global transcription phenomenon in thyroid cells.

functional studies described in the present paper confirmed physical in vivo interactions between pax <dig> and ctcf or sp <dig> in thyrocytes. these novel partners were further demonstrated to modulate the effect of pax <dig> on the transcription of the nis gene, thus confirming that these interactions are functionally relevant. evidence has been accumulating concerning the role of ctcf in the establishment of intra-chromosomal loops which ultimately mediate protein-protein contacts between distal complexes and the general transcription machinery  <cit> . on the other hand, sp <dig> is a ubiquitously expressed transactivator, which physically interacts with several components of tfiib and tfiid  and factors related to epigenetic events, such as histone deacetylases and p300/cbp histone acetyltransferase  <cit> . interestingly, several studies have described synergistic interactions between pax <dig> and p <dig> acetyltransferase for enhancing the transcriptional activity of thyroid-related genes  <cit> . taking into account this complete transcriptional scenario, our data describe potential interactions of pax <dig> with both common tfs and core elements, which could cooperate in chromatin remodeling for transcriptional regulation in thyroid cells.

identification of biological processes controlled by pax <dig> in thyroid cells
pax <dig> has been mainly associated to thyroid differentiation and development through its transcriptional role in key thyroid-related genes  <cit> . at this regard, we observed a downregulation of dio <dig> after abolishing pax <dig> , which potentially binds to a critical region for selenocystein insertion in the dio <dig> mrna. data were recently provided indicating that tsh tightly regulates dio <dig> expression in thyroid cells through pax8-dependent dio <dig> mrna stabilization . moreover, gene expression profiling in normal versus malignant thyroid tissues demonstrated a downregulation of dio <dig> and dio <dig>  <cit> , which could be linked to pax <dig> loss during cancer progression.

intriguingly, pax <dig> modulates the expression of several genes involved in carcinogenesis and thyroid malignancies  and cell cycle processes  . these findings are in accordance with previous studies in which pax <dig> expression was abolished in the differentiated thyroid cell line frtl <dig>  <cit> . our data would also explain the biological mechanism underlying the partial decrease in thyrocyte proliferation in response to both igf-i and tsh  after both nkx <dig>  and pax <dig> mrna silencing  <cit> .

dna-related biological processes involved a plethora of functional categories , highlighting the novel finding of brca1-dependence on pax <dig>  in this regard, shih et al described that brca <dig> and brca <dig> germline mutations were twice as common in individuals developing a second non-ovarian carcinoma, with follicular thyroid carcinoma being one of the most frequent secondary tumours  <cit> . this finding can be of great relevance in the development of sporadic thyroid tumors, given that, as mentioned before, pax <dig> expression is decreased or lost in thyroid tumours.

recent reports have associated the transcription factors pax <dig> and pax <dig> with increased capabilities for cell motility and adhesion in human cancer  <cit> . in parallel with these pax-related functions, we observed significant expression changes of loci involved in cell motion/adhesion, notably the pax <dig> effect on ncam <dig>  transcription. ncam <dig> and other components of adherens junctions, such as cadherins, have been described to be essential for maintaining cell polarity and epithelial integrity  <cit> . interestingly, cadherin- <dig>  was recently proposed to play a tsh-regulated role in thyroid development  <cit> , and its expression and promoter activity is controlled by pax <dig>  <cit> . we have not only confirmed transcriptional regulation of cdh <dig> by pax <dig>  but also defined additional pax8-dependent genes that could be essential for thyroid cell polarity . in this regard, germline mutations in myo5b have been associated with disruption of epithelial cell polarity in mvid   <cit> . this role is exerted via its involvement in vesicle trafficking through direct interactions with rab gtpase proteins, such as rab11a and rab8a. further functional studies should be performed to evaluate potential myo5b interactions with rab <dig>  another rab gtpase protein involved in membrane trafficking and confirmed as a pax <dig> target in the present study.

CONCLUSIONS
state-of-the-art cis-regulatory sequencing studies have been combined with mrna silencing and expression arrays to further characterize the functional relevance of tf-interacting dna regions and thus to define their transcriptional output. in our study, we describe pax <dig> as a master regulator of key cellular processes for thyrocyte biology, including cell cycle regulation, dna repair, replication and metabolism, and cell polarity, and define a large set of genes whose expression is modulated by pax <dig>  however, only a minor fraction  of the pax <dig> binding sites identified are close to tsss and correlate with altered mrna expression, in agreement with studies carried out on other tfss   <cit> . this moderate percentage may be explained by the pax <dig> binding site distribution, where most of the binding sites are related with orphan cgi regions. in this regard, our study demonstrates pax <dig> binding sites in regions distal to tsss, preferentially in intronic regions, which highlights a potential role as a distal or alternative transcriptional regulator, although this does not rule out indirect regulation. distal regulation by pax <dig> is supported by the interaction with chromatin remodeling factors such as ctcf and sp <dig> described in the present study. therefore, these findings suggest a new function of pax <dig> as a chromatin remodeling factor in thyroid follicullar cells, which should be validated and elucidated in future studies.
