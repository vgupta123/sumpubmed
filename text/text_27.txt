BACKGROUND
the spatial and temporal regulation of gene transcription is primarily determined by it's flanking promoter  through interaction with trans-acting regulatory proteins   <cit> . the start of transcription is accomplished by the formation of a pre-initiation complex on the dna, yet our knowledge of transcriptional initiation sequences in the human genome is still limited despite the availability of the complete genome sequence  <cit> . therefore one of the main remaining challenges is to locate these gene sequences, defined as the transcription start site , in order to explore core promoter and cis-regulatory elements that direct the start of every transcript. genomic structure and full length cdna sequences aligned on the genome provide opportunities to locate tsss. conventional methods for determining exact tsss, such as 5' race or primer extension are laborious and are not selective for the complete transcript. consequently, many mrna sequences stored in public databases lack information about their genuine 5' ends, mainly due to the difficulties in obtaining full-length cdna. several bioinformatic and experimental approaches have been developed to explore full-length cdnas and the human transcriptome  <cit> . computational predictions may represent a powerful tool to localize first exons and tsss on an averaged genome-wide scale  <cit> , however they may fail at the level of individual genes or in genes with complex regulatory patterns .

recently a number of experimental approaches to compile tsss on a genome-wide scale have been established including the database of human transcriptional start sites   <cit> , whole genome tilling array analysis  <cit> , and the exploration of mouse and human cage tag libraries  <cit> . to enable future progress we need to complete and revise these catalogues with an accurate annotation of the 5' and 3'end, and include splice isoforms of the transcripts. in addition to genome wide approaches, there is a need for more specific studies, which cover tissue specific genes, expressed in a restricted manner. identification of potential transcription signals that are tissue specific relies on the correct determination of transcriptional start sites.

in this work we describe an experimental approach to identify the tsss of a selected group of genes, which are predominantly expressed in retina. we focused our attention on the human retina, due to its unique and specialised function. this complex tissue, composed of multiple, highly differentiated and specific cell types , expresses a large number of specific genes. mutations in many of these genes result in blinding disorders. the subset of genes expressed in human retina has been partially elucidated  <cit> , with a number of studies defining genes that are either highly expressed in retina or which pose a crucial target of transcription factors in this tissue  <cit> . we selected a pool of retina expressed genes and employed cap selective race to ensure amplification and subsequent cloning of genuine tsss. we describe herein the results of this analysis, reporting the correct tsss within this group of retinal transcripts.

RESULTS
genes selection and in silico assembly
 <dig> annotated genes were selected for analysis. the selection was done based on the following criteria:  specific or high levels of expression in retina,  a role in retina specific physiological processes or retinal development, and  involvement in retinal disease. a compilation of all tested genes including gene symbol, definition, chromosomal location and tissue/cell type of expression is shown in additional file  <dig> 

cdna and transcript sequences available in public databases  were downloaded and new assemblies generated using seqman.

we found that 5' transcript termini represented in public datasets can be readily identified by clusters of cdna ends in the assemblies. additionally, the information about putative tsss was assessed in the eukaryotic promoter database  <cit>  and database of transcriptional start sites   <cit> . these data were compiled to create a preliminary gene model which was used to design primers for the subsequent cap-finder race experiments.

experimental examination of tsss
cap-finder race cdna fragments were cloned and a variable number of clones were sequenced for each gene, depending on the number and the sizes of the colony pcr products detected on the gel. we obtained products for  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> genes analysed. a summary of the results obtained with cap-finder race is shown in tables  <dig>  genes for which the promoter and tss were already known  served as internal positive controls. for each gene we detected at least one splice variant that agreed with one or more refseq annotated exons.

our strategy relies on the location of gene specific primers within internal exons. we obtained those cdna products that covered at least one exon-exon junction and thus ruled out the possibility of amplification of genomic contamination. this strategy has enabled us to identify alternatively spliced 5' ends that arise from tissue specific gene expression and regulation.

retinal expressed genes with new 5' exons
for  <dig> genes  we have identified a new exon composition at the 5' end of the transcript and in some cases new untranslated 5' exons that locate the tss several kilobases upstream or downstream from the annotated one.

- c1orf <dig>  this transcribed locus in chromosome  <dig> was selected for its retinal expression. for this gene, whose function is still not characterised, we retrieved two new isoforms lacking the first annotated exon found in refseq. these isoforms contain tsss in two new exons. one form displays a new first exon located  <dig> kb downstream from the previous tss. the other form presents a first exon located  <dig>  kb upstream of the former tss, generating a new first intron spanning a locus transcribed in the opposite strand, the gene mael. 

- cnga <dig>  codes for the Î±-subunits of the cone photoreceptor cgmp-gated channel, a crucial component of the cone phototransduction cascade in colour vision. mutation in this gene causes achromatopsia. the race experiment confirmed the presence of  <dig> isoforms, all containing a splicing of untranslated exon  <dig> localised  <dig>  kb upstream of exon <dig>  <cit>  .

- rdh <dig>  is an enzyme with dual-specificity retinol dehydrogenases that metabolise both all-trans- and cis-retinols, reported to be expressed in photoreceptors  <cit> . mutations within rdh <dig> cause both recessive early onset retinitis pigmentosa and leber's congenital amaurosis  <cit> . in human retinal mrna we retrieved two forms of the transcripts containing a new first exon located upstream of the refseq tss and a differentially spliced second exon. the in silico assembly and experimental pipeline allowed us report three putative tsss for this gene; the first is defined by the refseq annotation, the second was deduced from the most upstream transcript represented by ests from pooled colon and the third is a new tss displayed by retinal transcripts .

- dhrs <dig>  codes for an enzyme catalysing the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol in the presence of nadph  <cit> . the gene was included in our study for its high expression in retina. cap-finder race confirmed the previous first exon and tss. we also detected an alternative tss in a new first exon downstream from the annotated one which was predicted with firstef  <cit> . .

- elovl <dig> , family member 5). this gene was recently annotated as a retinal expressed gene  <cit>  and a target of mutation studies in retinitis pigmentosa  <cit> . we detected a new form of the transcript with a new first exon that was not previously annotated or described for retina. 

- kifc <dig>  codes for a retina specific microtubule-associated force-producing protein that may play a role in intracellular transport  <cit> . we have characterised two new isoforms of kifc <dig> retinal transcripts which lack the first  <dig> exons annotated in refseq. both transcripts include a new first exon that localizes these new tsss  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> kb downstream respectively from the tss referenced in the refseq database. the more upstream start site locates the gene in proximity to another retina specific gene . 

- rcv <dig>  inhibits rhodopsin kinase activity in retinal photoreceptors by reducing the binding of arrestin to rhodopsin. deregulation of recoverin expression in certain types of cancer demonstrates a pathological role in cancer-associated retinopathy  <cit> . although a previous study of the promoter was performed  <cit> , no clear evidence of the tss have been described. for this gene we detected three alternative transcripts; the first with the same 5' end as the previously annotated tss , the second with a more frequent isoform lacking the first exon and starting  <dig> bp upstream from the second exon of the refseq and the third form has a new first exon located downstream from the annotated one. .

- slc24a <dig>  codes for a potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger in cone photoreceptor  <cit> . although variant alleles of the cone slc24a <dig> gene have been identified, none of them are definitively associated with a specific retinal disease  <cit> . the new model we present for slc24a <dig> predicts three putative tsss located in two new additional exons that are alternatively spliced .

we also investigated whether the new exons that extend the 5' end of the transcript may introduce new potentially protein coding sequences. we didn't observe in any case an extension of the open reading frame beyond the annotated start codon. however short alternate open reading frames of at least  <dig> codons were observed for c1orf <dig> , cnga <dig> , dhrs <dig> , kifc <dig> , and slc24a <dig> . yet the translated sequences of these short orfs do not have homology with any protein in public databases.

detection of novel splicing variants and shorter transcripts
our experimental procedure described alternatively spliced isoforms for two genes impg <dig>  sag, which lack exon  <dig> of the refseq. these forms have not been annotated in the refseq database. we confirmed these alternatively spliced isoforms by regular rt-pcr . the second exon of the gene sag contains the tss and the presence of this alternative form, lacking the regular start site, may play a role in the regulation and further processing of the transcript. for  <dig> genes , we detected shorter transcripts that lack the annotated start codon. since these experiments were done with the same adapter ligated first-strand cdna we assume that these short transcripts are derived from true alternative tsss. these transcripts may be preferentially amplified in the rt-pcr and may be translated from an internal initiation codon. we report in table  <dig> the detailed results for these genes.

confirmation of results with primer extension
to provide an experimental validation of our results we undertook primer extension experiments. we performed reverse transcription of mrna with a sequence-specific fam-labelled primer for two genes . the length of the fam-labelled cdna primer extension product can be analysed on abi-dna genetic analyser using genescan software. as a result of the analyses we detected a fragment of  <dig> bp for cnga <dig>  and a fragment of  <dig> bp for rdh <dig> . the size of these fragments confirms the presence of the transcripts that we detected with race.

comparison with existing annotations and databases
to assess the quality of current annotations of the 5' end of genes expressed in human retina, the sequences obtained by 5' race were compared with the corresponding gene annotation/prediction. overall, race experiments detected  <dig> exons that were neither annotated nor predicted for retina transcripts;  <dig> exons did not have any matching experimental evidence in genbank, while the other  <dig> showed different boundaries or alternative splice sites. of these  <dig> un-annotated exons,  <dig> are first exons and can be considered the new first exon for the retinal transcripts. of the  <dig> genes successfully amplified,  <dig>  delivered 5' race sequences different from the annotation. results of a parallel project, dbtss  <cit> , supported our results concerning  <dig> of these genes  although the source of mrna was not human retina. we extended the annotated first exon of  <dig> refseq genes by an average of  <dig> transcribed bases. we compared our results with genome wide mapping of tsss using cage tags  <cit> . we found perfect correspondence for  <dig> transcript isoforms; for another  <dig> transcripts the start site retrieved in the cage database is located less than  <dig> bp away. for  <dig> transcript isoforms the tss is located in a different position . this discrepancy in the results may be due to the fact that the cage database doesn't include retina amongst the panel of analysed tissues and therefore lack specific and rare transcript isoforms present in that tissue.

shape of tsss and conservation
after analyzing the distribution of race clones we could define the shape of tsss according to the classification previously reported  <cit> . the different clones were clustered and depending on the start base position of each clone within a cluster we divided the start sites into four shapes. in the single dominant peak class  the majority of clones are concentrated to no more than four consecutive start positions with a single dominant tss. the clusters spanning a broader region are grouped in a general broad distribution , a broad distribution with a dominant peak  and a bi- or multimodal distribution :  <dig> genes showed a single dominant peak,  <dig> a broad distribution,  <dig> a bi-multi peak distribution and  <dig> a broad distribution with a dominant peak. for some transcripts we could not make a classification because the number of clones was less than  <dig>  we report the results of this analysis table  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows a graphical view of tsss identified for aoc <dig>  abca <dig>  rdh <dig>  and lrrc <dig> as an example of the different distributions observed. the classification of the shape of tsss defined by distribution of 5' end race clones within a cluster is useful for the further characterization of expression regulation. the distribution of the clones defines different elements of the core promoter and gives insights on the start of transcription. even if broad promoters are the major class in mammals  <cit> ,  <dig> of the analysed transcripts present a dominant peak highlighting the possibility that those transcripts are tightly regulated.

although tsss of orthologous genes do not necessary reside on equivalent locations because of evolution of mammalian tsss  <cit> , we analysed sequence conservation of the first new exons among a set of mammals : the range of conservation varies between  <dig> and  <dig> %. we report the pairwise alignment percentage of identity in additional file  <dig> 

sequences residing upstream and downstream from the boundaries of new defined exons are regions displaying high regulatory potential calculated by a computational algorithm  <cit>  integrated in the ucsc genome browser. the regulatory potential  scores computed for the  <dig> bp sequence upstream the tss shows that in  <dig> new first exons out of  <dig> the rp value exceeds an arbitrary threshold of  <dig>  . considering  <dig> bp downstream the splice site of the first exon the rp value is >  <dig>  at least for  <dig> first exons out of  <dig>  this observation confirms the importance of the new described exons to locate new regulatory elements that are important for transcription in retina.

a high level conservation was observed for splice donor sites of the new first exon.  <dig> genes show an average conservation of at least 75% in the region -3/+ <dig> spanning the splice donor site. for example, we report an inter-species alignment of the 3' end of exon  <dig> . the sequence conservation at the level of the splice donor site highlights the possibility of a particular role for this splicing .

discussion
now that the information pertaining to the genomes of human and other animals is available, the next challenge for genetic studies is to map the tsss and regulatory sequences of the genes. here, we carried out a study to determine the genuine tsss of a pool of retinal expressed genes. the results give correct information about the complete 5' end of transcripts and this data will be useful to locate the respective core and proximal promoter elements. we chose cap-finder race to map the tss of retinal expressed genes because this technique is selective for the complete transcript  <cit> . for  <dig> out of  <dig> successfully amplified genes, the cap-finder race experiments detected transcripts which are different from the current gene annotation in most cases the refseq was incomplete. transcripts were missing part of the first exon or even complete exons at the 5' end. this experimental determination of tsss shows that the current gene annotation was in most cases obtained from data sources that are not strictly selective for the complete transcribed form, and need to be updated. this procedure led us to discover several transcript isoforms that were un-annotated and to locate retina specific tsss. proteins encoded by these genes are essential for retina function and stability. a mutation in the cis-regulatory elements may influence the level of transcription and have a strong effect due to sensitivity of photoreceptors for high level transcription of genes involved in phototransduction. the new described cis-regulatory regions and untranslated exons are possible targets for mutation studies in retinal disorders. therefore new isoforms give a more complete picture of alternative start sites use in retina genes. the 5' untranslated region may contain important transcriptional and post transcriptional regulatory sites  <cit>  and therefore only the complete 5' utr provides the opportunity to study the potential regulatory role of these non-coding sequences. new reported tsss contribute to the identification of regulatory elements active in tissue specific gene regulation  <cit> . moreover, bioinformatics tools that identify common regulatory elements rely on the correct determination of tsss within a particular tissue  <cit> , therefore these computational approaches will only be effective after experimental validation of the 5' end of transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
we herein report the tsss for  <dig> retina expressed genes. our results define new and more precise locations of tsss for 76% of the analysed genes; moreover in 15% of the genes we found new exons in the 5' end of the transcripts. thus, this analysis of tsss in human retina was essential to define the complex pattern of transcripts present in this tissue.

our results highlight the importance of applying a tissue specific approach with a systematic program of cap-finder race using the known gene structures as a starting point and/or gene predictions to complete the existing gene annotation. the new tsss and transcribed sequences provide crucial information for further exploration of the promoter and other cis-regulatory sequences at the 5'end of the gene, and in particular for the study those elements that are functionally active in human retina.
