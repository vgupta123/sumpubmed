BACKGROUND
a bioinformatic approach to identifying cis-regulatory elements controlling transcription has become feasible with the availability of complete genome sequences and large scale expression data using high-throughput methods such as microarrays  <cit>  and sage  <cit> . the expression data provides a list of genes whose expression is significantly modified under a particular condition. however, this data does not indicate whether these genes are direct targets of a particular transcription factor or if the changes in expression are the result of an indirect effect caused by altering the expression of other transcription factors that work directly at the promoter. using information about sequence preference for binding of particular transcription factors, one can identify possible regulatory binding sites within a sequenced genome. however, this approach does not indicate if the sites are functional. we have therefore developed an algorithm that combines both of these approaches to distinguish between the direct and indirect targets that are regulated by a particular transcription factor.

we have applied this methodology to study the transcriptional regulatory system that specifies cell mating-type in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . yeast have three cell types, haploid a and α cells, and the a/α diploid, that differ in their ability to mate and in the proteins they express. cell mating-type is determined in part by α <dig> and a <dig>  which are cell-type-specific proteins that are members of the homeodomain  dna-binding family. in an a/α diploid cell, α <dig> binds with a <dig> to form a heterodimer complex that represses transcription of haploid-specific genes  <cit> . the crystal structures of the α <dig> hd binding dna alone and in complex with a <dig> have been solved, providing models for how these complexes bind dna  <cit> . biochemical and mutational analysis of each protein and their dna-binding sites have defined the requirements for dna recognition by this complex  <cit> . genome-wide expression analysis has also been performed on each of the different cell types  <cit> . the combination of these resources has allowed us to develop and test algorithms to identify target sites for the a1-α <dig> complex. previous work, using a relatively simple binding site search program identified targets for the α2-mcm <dig> complex, which represses a-cell-type specific genes in α and a/α cells  <cit> . the more advanced methods described in this paper have helped identify several novel targets of the a1-α <dig> complex that may be involved in cell-type specific processes. interestingly, we identified several genes that are repressed in diploid cells but do not appear to be direct targets of the a1-α <dig> complex, suggesting that these genes are controlled by another transcriptional regulatory factor that is directly or indirectly regulated by the a1-α <dig> complex. we have also identified a number of a1-α <dig> target sites that do not repress adjacent genes. the combination of site preference and expression data is therefore a valuable tool to identify direct functional targets of a transcription factor or complex.

RESULTS
development of a search algorithm for targets of the a1-α <dig> complex
to generate an algorithm that combines microarray expression data and mutational analysis of binding sites, we first defined a scoring method that ranks gene expression data. we utilized the microarray expression data from galitski and coworkers for gene expression in the a and α haploid and a/α diploid cells, as well as various polyploids  <cit> . since the a1-α <dig> complex should be absent in any of the homozygous a or α type polyploids  we expect the expression of haploid-specific genes in these cells to be much higher than in cells that are heterozygous for the mat locus . thus, one term in the scoring function rewards lower expression in heterozygous cell types compared to the homozygous cell types . we expect that most of the haploid-specific genes will be expressed equally in both of a and α cell types. consequently, we have introduced a second term in the scoring function that penalizes such differences in expression in the two haploid cell types. this scoring function would identify haploid-specific genes that are repressed in diploid cells, but would not indicate if these genes are direct targets of the a1-α <dig> repressor complex.

to identify genes from this ranking that are directly repressed by the a1-α <dig> complex we used the available mutational data on the a1-α2-binding site  <cit> . in these experiments, the effects of single base pair mutations of the a1-α <dig> consensus binding site were measured by assaying their ability to repress transcription of a heterologous promoter and by electrophoretic mobility shift dna-binding assays . under the assumption that the level of expression is proportional to how often that site is unoccupied, we used the effects of the single base mutations to estimate the parameters for the binding energy of sites with different bases at each position. we then used this information to search for potentially strong binding sites in the promoter regions  of every gene in the genome. this search provides us with a list of genes with putative a1-α <dig> binding sites in the promoter, irrespective of functionality.

even under ideal conditions, either of the above lists of genes would not directly indicate a haploid-specific gene directly repressed by the a1-α <dig> complex. in addition, our accuracy is limited by the noise in the microarray expression data, as well as by simplifying assumptions made to utilize single-base mutational data to score arbitrary sequences. we therefore decided to rank the genes using a scoring system that takes into account expression patterns across different mating types, as well as the likelihood of finding a good a1-α2-binding site in the promoter region of the gene. to test the significance of these composite scores, we generated permuted data, which combined random promoters with the expression data. this analysis suggested that the top 10– <dig> predictions were significant. the results of experiments on the  <dig> genes with the highest combined scores from our analysis are shown in table  <dig>

a1-α <dig> binding to the promoter regions of genes identified in the search
to evaluate the success of our computational algorithm for identifying direct targets of the a1-α <dig> repressor complex, we assayed binding by the complex to the identified promoters using chromatin-immunoprecipitation  assays with polyclonal antibody directed against the α <dig> protein. in α haploid and a/α-diploid cells the α <dig> protein combines with the mads-box transcription factor mcm <dig> to bind to elements in the promoters of a-specific genes to repress their transcription  <cit> . we therefore included in each pcr a primer set for the promoter region of the a-specific gene ste <dig> to serve as a positive control for the ability to chip α <dig> in both haploid α and diploid a/α cells. this primer set also allowed us to rule out the possibility that the predicted a1-α <dig> target genes were immunoprecipitating because of binding by the α2-mcm <dig> complex. the primer set for the ydl223c promoter, a gene not bound or repressed by the a1-α <dig> or α2-mcm <dig> complexes, was included in the reaction as a negative control for non-specific immunoprecipitation of the dna. a gel displaying the results for a few of the promoters that were assayed is shown in figure  <dig> and the data summarized for all the promoters that were predicted to be directly repressed by the a1-α <dig> complex is listed in table  <dig>  in general, there is a very good correlation between the experimental data with the predictions based on our computational algorithm. almost all of the high scoring genes were bound by the a1-α <dig> complex in vivo. genes that had a combined p-value higher than the threshold of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  do not appear to be strongly bound by the complex. this p-value corresponds to roughly a probability of one in six thousand, indicating it is possible to get such combination by chance.

in comparison to higher eukaryotes, most yeast promoters are relatively small and contain activator or repressor binding sites within several hundred base pairs of the start site of the open reading frame  of the gene. however, there are a few genes, like ho, whose regulation is controlled by a region several kb long. consequently, we did a separate search looking for additional a1-α <dig> binding sites that are within a region  <dig>  kb upstream of the orf. most of the sites identified in this search were well above the threshold value and were not bound by the a1-α <dig> complex in chip assays . however, the search identified one site upstream of the amn1/cst <dig> gene that was a potential target site. the chip analysis verified this as a functional target site for the a1-α <dig> complex in vivo .

analysis of haploid-specific genes predicted not to be bound by a1-α2
among the top  <dig> genes in the list ranked by haploid-specific expression score, more than half do not appear to contain an identifiable a1-α <dig> site by our analysis  . although there were no apparent strong affinity a1-α2-binding sites in the promoters of these genes, it is possible that there are several weak affinity sites in the promoter that were not identified in the search. if present, these sites may work cooperatively to increase binding by the a1-α <dig> complex to the promoter and therefore repress transcription. in support of this model we have found that under some conditions weak affinity a1-α <dig> sites in the ho promoter have a role in repression of the promoter . promoters with a number of weak affinity sites may therefore be directly regulated by the a1-α <dig> complex. however, it is also possible that these genes are indirectly repressed by a1-α <dig>  through its ability to repress expression of another transcription factor that is required for expression of the genes identified in the microarray. to distinguish between these possibilities we assayed for a1-α <dig> binding to these promoters by chip . as predicted from the site identification analysis, the a1-α <dig> complex did not appear to bind to most of these promoters. this result suggests that these genes are not directly repressed by the complex. the one exception to our predictions was that the a1-α <dig> complex appeared to weakly bind to the nem <dig> promoter in the chip assays . interestingly, nem <dig> is downstream of gpa <dig>  a gene that is strongly repressed by the a1-α <dig> complex . binding and repression by a1-α <dig> at gpa <dig> may help binding to weak sites in the nem <dig> promoter. alternatively, although we sheared the dna used in the chip to an average of less than  <dig> bp, it is possible that there may have been some fragments that spanned the ~ <dig> kb between the genes, thereby giving a positive result in the chip assay.

comparison with binding site identification by the weight matrix method
we compare the performance of our algorithm with that of the weight matrix method  <cit> . in our study, we derived our parameters from a set of artificial sequences. usually, the weight matrix has to be constructed from a set of known sites. we calculate the weight matrix for a1-α <dig> from regulatory elements upstream several known target genes: ho, gpa <dig>  fus <dig>  axl <dig>  ste <dig>  rme <dig> and matα <dig>  as usual, one is faced with a choice of threshold weight matrix score for selecting putative sites in the yeast genome. for a stringent threshold that corresponds to the top  <dig> targets, we recovered all the genes, other than rme <dig>  used in construction of the weight matrix. however, we did not recover most of the other genuine targets identified, and verified, in this study. if we set the threshold to be lax enough to include rme <dig>  we obtained  <dig> candidate genes, including ste <dig> and rdh <dig>  but still miss targets like ste <dig>  it is likely that most of the  <dig> putative targets are false positives, as evidenced by lack of haploid-specific regulation in the corresponding gene expression data.

overall, we find our method to be more successful than the weight matrix method. the use of mutational data as opposed to literature based data for sequence preference possibly accounts for part of the success . however, much of our success has to do with cutting down of false positive rates by using microarray data judiciously.

analysis of all potential a1-α <dig> target sites in the genome
among the genes identified in the computational analysis, there is a good correlation between the presence of strong a1-α2-binding sites in their promoter region and repression in diploid cells. this raises the question of whether all a1-α2-binding sites function as repressor sites. to address this question we searched for all potential binding sites in the yeast genome. as expected, many of the best sites are in the promoters of known or previously identified haploid-specific genes . however, we also identified a number of putative a1-α2-binding sites within orfs . to test if the a1-α <dig> complex is able to bind to these sites we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays  with purified α <dig> and a <dig> proteins and radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing these sites . the a1-α <dig> complex bound to sites from the ykl162c, cdc <dig>  prm <dig>  prm <dig>  and urb <dig> orfs with weaker affinity than to a strong binding site from the ho promoter, ho. however, these sites did have slightly better binding affinity than to the ho site, which we have shown is unable to repress transcription on its own .

d relative binding affinity in fold decrease in affinity compared to the ho binding site.

since the a1-α <dig> complex was able to bind to these sites with weak to moderate affinity in vitro, it is possible these sites may partially repress transcription on their own. to test this model, we cloned these sites into the context of the cyc <dig> promoter driving expression of a lacz gene and measured the ability of the sites to repress transcription of the reporter in diploid cells  <cit> . the sites from the cdc <dig> and urb <dig> orfs did not repress transcription of the reporter promoter in diploid cells . however, the site from prm <dig> orf, which showed the highest binding affinity among the sites found in orf regions, weakly  repressed the reporter promoter. this result indicates that this site can function as a repressor site in vivo if placed in the proper context. we next tested whether a1-α <dig> bound to these sites in the normal genomic context in vivo by chip assays. none of the sites in the orf regions were bound by the a1-α <dig> complex . this result indicates that while they are competent for weak binding and repression in a heterologous promoter, they are unable to repress transcription in their normal genomic context.

our search also identified several potential a1-α <dig> binding sites in the promoter regions of genes that do not appear to be repressed in diploid cells . only the cox <dig> site had moderate binding affinity for the a1-α <dig> complex in the emsas . however, despite the relatively weak binding affinity of these sites, they were able to partially repress transcription of the reporter in diploid cells . in particular, the sites from the cox <dig> and rex <dig> promoters showed significant levels of repression. interestingly, although these sites functioned as repressor sites in the context of the heterologous reporter, except for the cox <dig> promoter, most of these sites were not bound by the a1-α <dig> complex at their genomic locations by chip assays . these results suggest that the genomic context of most of these a1-α <dig> sites prevents binding by the complex.

discussion
genome-wide gene expression data using sage or dna microarrays has provided a wealth of information on the regulation of genes under certain conditions or by specific transcription factors. the combination of this information with sequence analysis programs has enabled researchers to identify potential regulatory sites. for example, in a pioneering paper, tavazoie et al. clustered expression data and used multiple local sequence alignment algorithms on the promoter regions of the co-clustered genes to discover regulatory motifs  <cit> . this approach has been further refined by using bayesian networks to incorporate additional constraints regarding relative positions and the orientations of the motifs  <cit> . another approach has been to break the genes into modules and perform module assignments and motif searches at the same time via an expectation maximization algorithm   <cit> . although these approaches have worked well at identifying potential targets sites one drawback is that the expression patterns have to cluster well for these methods to work. for a small number of microarray experiments, this may always not be the case. a method that does not utilize clustering is a regression model based analysis to locate "words" in the promoter that correlates with modulation of expression  <cit> . however, this approach is restricted to retrieving functional consensus binding sites in the promoter regions and for transcription factors with low sequence specificity, this approach needs to be modified. most of these approaches attack the difficult problem of what to do when relatively little is known about the regulatory system and sequence recognition by the protein. consequently they develop pattern recognition algorithms that are essentially unsupervised. our focus has been to take advantage, as much as possible, of knowledge about the biological system and use that information combined with expression analysis to identify potential target sites. the minor loss of generality of the tools resulting from such an approach is more than offset by its predictive power.

to determine if the changes in expression of a specific gene are the result of a transcription factor working at the promoter we developed an algorithm that combines expression data with information on the binding site preference for a transcription factor. as a test for this algorithm we identified genes in yeast that are direct targets for regulation by the a1-α <dig> repressor complex. we also used this method to identify genes that are repressed in diploid cells but that are not direct targets of the complex, as well as functional a1-α <dig> binding sites that do not appear to repress transcription in their genomic context. the combination of these sets of findings has provided insight into the regulatory network and mechanism of repression by the a1-α <dig> complex.

the primary goal of this study was to identify genes that are direct targets for repression by the a1-α <dig> complex. there are two major functional subsets among the a1-α <dig> target genes identified in this analysis . one, not surprisingly, involves genes that are required for various processes in mating of the two haploid cell-types. these include components of the mating pheromone signal transduction pathway, such as gpa <dig>  ste <dig>  ste <dig>  and ste <dig>  which are activated in response to the binding of pheromone from the other cell type  <cit> . this group also includes genes further down that pathway, such as far <dig> and fus <dig>  which are required for cell-cycle arrest before mating. a number of these genes have previously been shown or suspected to be under the control of a1-α <dig> repressor complex  <cit> . repression of these genes in diploid cells is biologically important because it prevents further mating by diploid cells. if diploid cells mate they would form triploids or higher ordered genomic polyploids, which are genetically unstable during meiosis and therefore detrimental to cell survival.

the second subset of genes identified in the analysis is associated with mating type switching and recombination. the ho gene is a known target of the a1-α <dig> complex and its promoter contains  <dig> binding sites of varying affinity  <cit> . repression of ho is essential in diploid cells because it prevents switching of one of the mat loci to form homozygous a/a or α/α diploid cells. although diploid in genomic content, cells homozygous for the mat loci are competent to mate and therefore would form higher order genomic polyploids that are genetically unstable. we have also shown that nej <dig>  which is involved in non-homologous end-joining , is a direct target for the a1-α <dig> complex  <cit> . it has been proposed that that repression of the nhej pathway may promote homologous recombination and crossing over in diploid cells. in addition, we found that rdh <dig>  a gene involved in double-stranded dna break repair, is a direct target for the a1-α <dig> complex  <cit> . this result is somewhat unexpected because rdh <dig> is required for meiosis and null mutants show significantly reduced spore viability. it is likely that the a1-α <dig> complex only partially reduces the level of expression of the gene and that diploid cells require a lower level of activity of the protein.

we also identified several genes that fell outside of these two subsets. one is rme <dig>  which encodes a transcriptional repressor of ime <dig>  the master regulator of meiosis  <cit> . a1-α2-mediated repression of rme <dig> is required to allow cells to enter the meiotic pathway in diploid cells. interestingly, we also found that pde <dig> and met <dig> are weakly, but reproducibly, direct targets for repression by the a1-α <dig> complex. the pde <dig> protein is a low affinity camp phosphodiesterase that appears to have a role in response to stress and cell aging  <cit> . repression of pde <dig> in diploids may partially account for the difference of starvation response between haploids and diploids. met <dig> is a zinc finger dna-binding protein that activates genes involved in sulfur metabolism  <cit> . it is unclear why this gene would be a target for the a1-α <dig> complex.

it is possible that the presence of an a1-α <dig> target site upstream of a gene that has lower expression in diploid cells was fortuitous and that these sites were not functional targets. however, if this was the case then there would be little pressure to conserve these binding sites through evolution. several closely related species of yeast have been sequenced and comparison of the corresponding promoter regions has led to the discovery of conserved regulatory motifs  <cit> . although lack of conservation does not imply non-functionality, significant conservation strongly argues for functionality of a putative regulatory element. to investigate this possibility, we performed a phylogenetic comparison to infer whether these sites are preserved among six sequenced saccharomyces species using the phylogibbs program  <cit> . the program identified the a1-α <dig> binding site among a promoter set including many known haploid-specific genes . this analysis also showed that the a1-α <dig> binding sites in the rdh <dig>  pde1and met <dig> promoters are strongly conserved among multiple species, suggesting that these sites play an important functional role.

our analysis identified a number of haploid-specific genes that do not appear to be direct targets of the a1-α <dig> repressor complex . genes in this list do not contain a recognizable a1-α2-binding site and, with the exception of nem <dig>  are not detectably bound by the a1-α <dig> complex in the chip assays. it is possible that a1-α <dig> indirectly turns off these genes by repressing an activator protein that is required for their expression. however, besides met <dig>  there were no obvious genes coding for activator proteins that were direct targets of the a1-α <dig> complex. it is possible that the haploid-specific genes without a1-α <dig> sites are indirectly repressed through more complex mechanisms that involve repression of rme <dig> 

we also identified potential a1-α2-binding sites in the genome that do not appear to repress expression of nearby genes. although sites from the prm <dig>  prm <dig>  cdc <dig>  and lsm <dig> promoters appear to be moderate binding sites for the a1-α <dig> complex in vitro, chip and heterologous reporter assays showed these sites are neither bound by the proteins nor are functional repressor sites in vivo. many of these sites lie in open reading frames of actively transcribed genes and so it is possible that transcription through the binding site or the chromatin structure of the region prevents high affinity binding by the complex. the model that the genomic context of these sites is important for their regulatory activity is further supported by our results that show that some of these sites, such as cox <dig> and rex <dig>  function as strong a1-α <dig> dependent repressor sites in the context of the heterologous promoter. although a1-α <dig> complex is bound to the cox <dig> site in vivo it does not appear to repress transcription of this gene in diploid cell. interestingly, this binding site is very close to the end of the coding region of ime <dig>  an inducer of meiosis that is expressed in diploid cells  <cit> . the ime <dig> gene is only expressed in diploid cells and it was thought that the a1-α <dig> complex may be indirectly activating its expression by repressing a repressor protein, such as rme <dig>  however, the fact that a1-α <dig> binds to the downstream region of this gene suggests that it may play a direct role in its expression.

our data shows that the algorithm we have developed is useful in sorting between direct and indirect targets of a transcription factor. although we have used mutational data to define the binding site for the a1-α <dig> complex, in principal binding site sequences derived from site selection experiments may also be used. this analysis may also complement genome-wide chip studies to identify the target sites of the transcription factor.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we show that combining microarray data with motif analysis, lets us distinguish between the genes that are direct targets of a transcription factor and those that are modulated because of secondary effects. we get excellent agreement of the computational predictions with location analysis by chip experiments. we find most of the direct targets of a1/α <dig> complex to be involved in the mating pathway, mating type switching, recombination and meiosis. we also found a few weak targets that are possibly involved in sensing and control of the metabolic state. we also see that the sites we predict solely based on single species data are often evolutionarily conserved in other species of saccharomyces.
