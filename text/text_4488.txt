BACKGROUND
natural rubber accounts for  <dig> % of the  <dig>  million tons of rubber consumed worldwide  <cit> . hevea brasiliensis is the sole commercial source of natural rubber. the increasing demand for natural rubber calls for improved productivity in rubber plantations. cis- <dig> -polyisoprene chains are synthesized in the rubber particles of latex cells. rubber particles account for up to 90% of the dry matter in latex cytoplasm, which is harvested by tapping the soft bark of rubber trees  <cit> . latex production depends on genetic, environmental and harvesting components. harvesting systems use ethephon, an ethylene  releaser applied to the tapping panel, to stimulate latex production by improving the flow and regeneration of latex. tapping and ethephon stimulation frequencies are adjusted to hevea clones according to their metabolism  <cit> . given the high pressure in the phloem tissue, latex is expelled after tapping. tapping and ethephon are likely to be sources of stress conducive to the production of secondary metabolites and consequent rubber, but over a certain stress limit they lead to tapping panel dryness   <cit> . mechanical wounding and osmotic stresses related to tapping trigger the production of endogenous ethylene and oxylipins such as jasmonic acid   <cit> . both mechanical wounding and methyl-jasmonate treatments induce the differentiation of secondary latex cells in extended young stems  <cit> . in trees, secondary latex cells are differentiated from cambium and then anastomosed to create laticifer vessels  <cit> . ethephon application also induces several biochemical processes in laticifers, such as sucrose loading, water uptake, nitrogen assimilation or synthesis of defence proteins  <cit> , involving a large number of ethylene-response genes  <cit> , whereas its direct role in rubber biosynthesis is controversial  <cit> .

given the major role of ethylene and jasmonic acid in regulating latex cells, ethylene-response factors are greatly expected to be involved in latex cell functioning. indeed, et and ja signalling pathways involve transcription factors such as ethylene-responsive element binding proteins , also called the ethylene-response factors  family  <cit> . erfs have been shown to act as activators or repressors of additional downstream ethylene responsive genes. erfs are a control point for crosstalk with other signals and they function as an integrator of the ethylene and jasmonic acid pathway  <cit> . multiple signalling pathways converge on erfs by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . ethylene and jasmonate pathways converge in the transcriptional activation of ethylene response factor <dig> , which regulates in vivo the expression of a large number of genes responsive to both ethylene and jasmonate. erf <dig> acts downstream of the intersection between the ethylene and jasmonate pathways suggesting that this transcription factor is a key element in the integration of both signals for the regulation of defence response genes  <cit> . in biotic stress, ap2/erf transcription factor ora <dig> acts as the integrator of the ja and et signalling pathways and is the key regulator of ja- and et-responsive pdf <dig>  expression  <cit> .

the erf family was first discovered in nicotiana tabaccum by ohme-takagi and shinshi  <cit> . the erf family is one of the largest families of transcription factors with  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> predicted transcription factors from  <dig> families in arabidopsis <cit> . the erf family belongs to the ap2/erf superfamily. this superfamily encodes transcriptional regulators that serve a variety of functions in plant development and responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli  <cit> . members of the ap2/erf superfamily contain at least one ap <dig> domain, which consists of about  <dig> amino acids. this domain is involved in dna binding to a conserved agccgcc sequence called the gcc-box  <cit>  or to a dehydration response element  containing the c-repeat  <cit> . the structure of the ap <dig> domain was first reviewed by riechmann and coll.  <cit> . initially, the apetala <dig>  gene was isolated by t-dna insertional mutagenesis in arabidopsis <cit> . this gene encodes a 432-amino acid protein with two copies of a 68-amino acid direct repeat called the ap <dig> domain. the ap <dig> domain consists of three anti-parallel β-sheets and one α-helix. two conserved elements, yrg and rayd, have been identified. the latter is an 18-amino acid core region that is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix  <cit> . in some ap <dig> genes, the ap <dig> domain contains a 37-amino acid serine-rich acidic domain putatively functioning as an activation domain, and a 10-amino acid domain including a putative nuclear localization sequence kksr  <cit> . while previously thought to be plant-specific transcription factors, ap <dig> domain-containing genes were recently found in bacteria and viruses, which are predicted to be hnh endonucleases  <cit> .

several ways of classifying the ap2/erf superfamily have been proposed in plants. although all of them are based on the number of ap <dig> domains, some differences exist. firstly, sakuma et al. described five subfamilies including ap <dig>  rav, dehydration responsive element binding proteins , ethylene-responsive element binding proteins , also called the ethylene-response factors  family  <cit> , and others based on a homology of the dna binding domain, and the dna sequences that bind it, namely the dre element or gcc-box separately  <cit> . the ap <dig>  erf/dreb and rav subfamilies have two ap <dig> domains, one ap <dig> domain, or one ap <dig> and one b <dig> domain, respectively. groups a <dig> to a <dig> and b <dig> to b <dig> have been assigned to the dreb and erf families  <cit> . secondly, nakano et al. classified these proteins in only three major families: ap <dig>  erf and rav  <cit> . the erf family was then divided into ten groups according to the structure of the ap <dig> domain, with groups i to iv corresponding to the dreb subfamily in sakuma’s classification. to date, nakano’s classification method has remained a reference for organizing the ap2/erf superfamily in three families  and the erf family in ten groups. in the construction of phylogenetic trees, methods for multiple sequence alignment and tree reconstruction have to be considered with caution. in the analyses by sakuma and nakano, clustalw followed by a neighbor-joining method was chosen. currently, although computationally intensive, the multiple sequence alignment software muscle followed by a maximum likelihood method  is more relevant  <cit> .

the availability of the whole genome sequence of several plant species has made it possible to confirm a relatively well-conserved organization of the ap2/erf superfamily with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in arabidopsis thaliana, vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa oryza sativa, and solanum lycopersicon, mostly represented by the erf family  <cit> . transcript sequencing is also an alternative for identifying such gene families. for instance,  <dig> ap2/erf genes consisting of  <dig> erfs,  <dig> ap2s and  <dig> ravs were identified in gossypium hirsutum from est databases  <cit> . in hevea brasiliensis, transcriptome sequencing has been carried out on latex, bark, leaf and shoot apex tissues using various methods  <cit> . a few number of erf sequences have been released in the genbank   <cit> . as preliminary experiment, we identified ap2/erf unigenes from latex and leaf tissues of the hevea clone reyan 7-33- <dig> members  <cit> . this analysis revealed  <dig> ap2/erf with partial ap <dig> domain that did not allow gene classification . given the involvement of wounding, jasmonate and ethylene in natural rubber production, we developed a reference transcriptome that covers a large number of tissues and environmental conditions to have a fully comprehensive hevea transcriptome and we examined the organization of the ap2/erf superfamily in hevea. firstly, rnas were isolated from different tissues of plants at several stages of development growing under various conditions, and transcripts were sequenced using gs-flx next-generation sequencing  technologies. secondly, contigs harbouring at least one ap <dig> domain were identified in tissue-type libraries for leaves, bark, latex, roots and embryogenic tissues and from a global library which pooled reads from all tissue-type libraries. ap <dig> domain-containing genes were aligned with the arabidopsis ap2/erf sequences and classified according to nakano’s method based on a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved ap <dig> domain, which was optimized using a maximum likelihood method   <cit> . post-transcriptional regulation was checked by predicting microrna-targeted ap2/erf genes. this study suggested that some hbap2/erf genes expressed in latex cells could be involved in specific biological processes.

RESULTS
transcript sequence libraries
transcript sequences were produced for five tissue-type libraries  from the hevea clone pb  <dig> by the pyrosequencing gs-flx  <dig> technique. total mrnas were isolated from different tissues collected from plants at different stages of development and having undergone different treatments in order to have the most complete representation of the transcriptome . a half run of  <dig> sequencing generated more than  <dig>  reads for each tissue-type library . an automatic pipeline was used to remove reads shorter than 120 bp and non-coding sequences and for clustering and assembly of contigs with tgicl . the annotation of contigs has been proceeded using mir target prediction by miranda, and protein function by similarity with several protein sequence databases by blast. for the embryogenic tissues, leaf, bark, latex and root libraries, the number of contigs was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . reads from all libraries  were re-assembled in a global library to generate  <dig>  contigs. the large coverage of the global library led to improve contig lengths, which reached 807 bp on average.

rna sequencing was carried out on a mix of rnas from the same tissues of various plant materials grown under specified treatments. mm, exp and dm media are used for callus proliferation, somatic embryogenesis induction and embryo development, respectively. all media are described in  <cit> .

identification and classification of ap2/erf superfamily genes in hevea
hevea ap2/erf transcripts were identified using tblastn to search for translated nucleotide in the global hevea transcript library using the amino acid arabidopsis thaliana ap <dig> domain sequences as the query. the  <dig> putative ap2/erf superfamily contigs identified in the global transcript sequence database contained full-length and partial transcripts. of them,  <dig> contigs had the full-length ap <dig> domain sequences of 58– <dig> amino acids. multiple alignment analysis was performed on full-length ap <dig> domain sequences from hevea, arabidopsis and populus. group classification was firstly achieved by constructing the general phylogenetic tree of ap <dig> domains in arabidopsis and hevea with the neighbour-joining method , and then the phylogenetic relationships between these genes were analysed by constructing another phylogenetic tree using the phyml method only for hevea . the nakano classification method was used to organize the hevea ap2/erf superfamily into families and groups. the alignments indicated three clusters corresponding to the ap <dig>  erf and rav families, with the erf family divided into eleven major groups including an additional vi-l group, and the three soloists rooted with the ap <dig> family. the ap <dig> family was organized in two groups including eight aintegumenta  and twelve ap <dig> genes.

the number of members of the hevea ap2/erf superfamily was compared with six other species . the ap2/erf superfamily has a similar number of genes in vitis  and arabidopsis . this number is higher for gossypium , populus  and hevea , while it is lower for solanum  and triticum . these differences were mostly induced by a change in the number of erf genes. in hevea, twenty-five genes were assigned to the ap <dig> family based on the identity of their amino acid sequences with the a. thaliana ap <dig> proteins and the presence of a double ap <dig> domain in their sequences. this number included contigs with one or two partial ap <dig> domains. ten genes containing a single complete/partial ap <dig> domain were classified in the ap <dig> family given their greater homology with the ap <dig> family. the largest family was the erf family with  <dig> genes harbouring a single ap <dig> domain, including twenty-six contigs with a partial sequence of the ap <dig> domain. four genes were classified in the rav family, which had one single ap <dig> domain and one b <dig> domain. three soloist genes were identified in hevea whereas only one has been reported for arabidopsis and populus, and no soloists have been identified in solanum and gossypium.

these ap2/erf sequences were obtained either after genome sequencing or transcriptome sequencing.

one hundred and fifteen hevea genes with a full ap <dig> domain from the erf family were organized in eleven groups according to the nakano classification, including the vi-like group . the number of genes  for the hevea erf family was comparable to that for arabidopsis, gossypium and vitis . the hevea erf groups showed several characteristics. firstly, several erf groups and subgroups found in arabidopsis, such as subgroup iic and groups ivb, xc and xb-l, were not found in hevea . secondly, gossypium  and hevea  have the largest number of erf genes for group vii and conversely they have the smallest number of genes for group iv with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively for these two species.

the alignment of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the three hevea soloists revealed that they shared  <dig>  to  <dig> % and  <dig>  to  <dig> % of identity, respectively . for the ap <dig> domain, this identity reached  <dig>  to  <dig> %. a multiple alignment analysis was carried out on ap <dig> domain sequences from hevea, arabidopsis and populus . this phylogenetic analysis revealed an evolution of the three hevea soloists after speciation phenomena with arabidopsis and more recently with populus. nakano’s classification method was compared with sakuma’s for the  <dig> hevea genes with a complete ap <dig> domain . families and groups were noted as subfamilies and subgroups previously by sakuma. erf genes were classified in two subfamilies consisting of thirty-three dreb  and eighty-two erf  genes. erf subfamily genes were twice as large as the dreb subfamily in hevea.

alignments were carried out on sequences which overlap from the full nucleotide sequences , the full deduced amino acid sequences ; and the amino acid sequences of ap <dig> domains .

in this presentation, ap2/erf genes with at least one full-length domain were kept.

structure and group-specific residues of the ap <dig> domains of erf genes
the amino acid sequences of the ap <dig> domain from fifty-five representative erf genes with full-length transcript sequences were aligned in order to identify the structure and the group-specific residues . tertiary structures of the ap <dig> domain were predicted and revealed similarity to aterf <dig> for each gene consisting of a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and one α-helix . specific amino acid residues were also identified for each group. ap <dig> domains from erf family proteins contained the wlg motif and most of them also contained the yrg and rayd elements. the positions of the ap <dig> domain were numbered according to the three-dimensional structure of aterf <dig>  ten amino acids were totally conserved in each group . most ap <dig> domain sequences had conserved amino acid residues: v <dig> and e <dig> for groups i to iv and a <dig> and d <dig> for groups v to x, which corresponded to v <dig> and e <dig> for dreb and a <dig> and d <dig> for the erf subfamilies according to sakuma’s classification, respectively . a few members that did not show any conservation at these positions  <dig> and  <dig> were categorized based on their placement in the phylogenetic tree. a conservative sequence motif of  <dig> amino acid residues  only occurred in group vi-l.

the group-specific amino acid residues observed in hevea were compared with those of arabidopsis and gossypium . at least one group-specific residue could be identified for each group, two for groups ii and viii, and three for group vii. hevea group vi-l revealed one more group-specific residue  in addition to the k <dig> found in all species. for group ix, one additional residue at position  <dig> was identified for all species leading to an ap <dig> domain of  <dig> amino acids long, as opposed to  <dig> for the other groups. in the hevea, arabidopsis and gossypium ap <dig> family, the ap <dig> domains contain a conserved amino acid, t <dig>  or a <dig> . the ap <dig> domains of the rav family have the amino acid residue v <dig> conserved at 100% in hevea, arabidopsis and gossypium.

the presented residues were the most conserved for the three compared species .  hevea-specific residue compared to the other two species.  additional amino acid residue compared to the other groups.  non-conserved residue.

distribution of reads from ap2/erf contigs in the various tissue-type libraries
the distribution of reads constituting ap2/erf contigs in each tissue-type library reflected the global level of expression of ap2/erf genes in each tissue . the number of reads was more abundant in roots with  <dig> % , bark with  <dig> % , followed by latex with  <dig> % , embryogenic tissues with  <dig> %  and then leaves with  <dig> % .

the sum of reads for the various erf groups showed that some groups were more represented in some tissues . a higher read number was observed in latex for groups ii, vii and viii, in bark for groups iii, vi-l and ix, in leaves for groups ii, viii and ix, in roots for groups i, iv, v, vi and vii, and in embryogenic tissues for group x only. the deseq statistical analysis of the read distribution for each contig did not revealed any significant differential gene expression . all ap2/erf families and all erf groups were represented. thirty-seven transcripts were detected in all five tissues. fifty-nine contigs were built from reads found in latex.

expression profile in various tissues for ten selected ap2/erf genes
ten ap2/erf genes were selected for their high number of reads per contig or their presence in some tissue-type libraries. primer were designed , and their specificity was confirmed for each gene by a unique pick of the fusion curve after real-time rt-pcr amplification . their relative transcript abundance was checked by real-time rt-pcr using hbrh2b as stable internal control between each tissue . the highest relative transcript abundance was found for hberf-viia <dig>  which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  interestingly, hberf-iib <dig> and hberf-viia <dig> showed significant higher relative transcript abundance in latex than other tissues,  <dig>  and  <dig> respectively, like it was observed for the read distribution. nevertheless, latex specificity of hberf-iib <dig> expression was not proved since transcripts of this gene were also highly accumulated in embryogenic callus. relative transcript accumulation was noted in embryogenic tissues  for hberf-iib <dig>  hberf-viia <dig>  hbap2- <dig> and hbap2- <dig>  the high read distribution counted in root was confirmed by high relative transcript abundance in the tap root of one-year-old plants. finally, no significant difference could be found in relative transcript abundance for hberf-viiia <dig> in contrast with the higher read distribution in latex and leaf compared with other tissues.

prediction of microrna-targeted ap2/erf genes
twelve micrornas  were predicted to inhibit hevea transcripts of twenty-nine hbap2/erf genes . eight microrna families  were predicted to inhibit thirteen latex-expressed transcripts . although inhibition mostly involved a transcript cleavage, the inhibition of translation was predicted for nine genes . predicted microrna sites were in the conserved ap <dig> domain , in the cds outside the ap <dig> domain for sixteen genes, and in the utr for eight genes.

target accessibility is represented as the maximum energy needed  to unpair the secondary structure around target site on target mrna. the lower the energy the greater the possibility that small rna is able to contact  target mrna. the lower the free energy the greater the possibility that small rna is able to contact target mrna. the predicted microrna was based on a free energy threshold below −20 kcal/mol.

discussion
ngs data combined with an optimized method of alignment and classification led to the identification of the hevea ap2/erf superfamily
the ap2/erf superfamily has been identified in several species from both genome and est sequences. for the first time to our knowledge, this study presented the identification of most members of the ap2/erf superfamily using the  <dig> sequencing technology for crop plants for which few data are available and especially for rubber. the one hundred and seventy-three ap2/erf members identified in hevea were clustered into three main families  and a group of  <dig> soloists using a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. the erf family was then subdivided into  <dig> major groups, which corresponded to groups i to x, and group vi-like described by nakano  <cit> . the stringency used for the read assembly led to discriminate the various allelic forms. hevea brasiliensis is highly heterozygous that should lead to have various allelic forms in the assembled contigs and consequently less genes than ap2/erf members. the number of hevea ap2/erf genes was comparable to the number observed in other species. rna sequencing of additional tissues, such as flowers, should lead to cover the whole transcriptome.

the first phylogenetic analyses came up against the low quality of contig sequences from ngs . the minimum overlap length was increased to 60 bp compared to the 40 bp used in jatropha curcas for instance, with a minimum overlap identity of 95%  <cit> . finally, the assembly strategy for hevea reads delivered robust contigs from current programs since the clustering method discriminated conserved domains from the various ap2/erf genes. sequences of ap2/erf genes were shown to be from unique transcript for  <dig> genes in this study and more recently for  <dig> genes by analysis of the fusion curve after real-time rt-pcr amplification . in addition, homopolymer correction by mapping solexa reads was not required. the neighbour-joining tree built from the protein distance matrix with manual correction proposed by nakano was widely adopted for classification of the erf family. based on ngs contigs, the classification method proposed by nakano provided inconsistent results due to errors and the accuracy rate of contig sequences. an ap <dig> domain block of  <dig> amino acids was selected for the alignment of  <dig> sequences with a full ap <dig> domain using a combination of muscle and gblock softwares. the use of gblocks reduced the need for manual editing of multiple alignments. this method facilitated the construction of a consistent phylogenetic tree with phyml software without requiring a bayesian inference method. the latter method was successfully used to classify the arabidopsis erf protein family  <cit> . these authors included groups vi-like and xb-like described by nakano et al. in their phylogenetic reconstruction, and ultimately assigned these groups as new groups xi and xii, respectively. group vi-l genes were close to group vi, with a modification in the second element suggesting that the evolution of group vi-l is more recent than that of the other groups. this independent cluster on the hevea phylogenetic tree led us to propose it as a new group .

hevea ap2/erf genes have common and several specific features compared to other species
several functionally important conserved motifs described in arabidopsis and tomato were also found in hevea ap2/erf deduced proteins suggesting that they are likely to function as transcription factors  <cit> . the putative nuclear localization signal  motif near the r <dig> domain was found in hevea ap2/erf transcription factor sequences . the residues g <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  g <dig>  e <dig>  i <dig>  g <dig> and a <dig> were completely conserved among all  <dig> erf proteins collected from three species . these observations are generally consistent with earlier reports on this topic  <cit> . the conserved ala- <dig>  in the erf domain has been suggested to play a major role in the stability of the erf domain or dna binding with the dre element or gcc box  <cit> . the erf-associated amphiphilic repression  motif was first described by ohta  <cit> . the ear motif is found in group ii and viii. dear <dig>  a dreb protein-containing ear motif, has been shown to mediate crosstalk between signalling pathways for biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . the ear motif exists in all members of erf group viii in tomato  <cit>  and in erf group viiia in arabidopsis <cit> .

soloists have been characterized by low conservation at the erf dna-binding domain in all plant genomes considered  <cit> . in hevea, we showed that this low conservation could be explained by  <dig> missing amino acid residues in their ap <dig> domain, including r <dig>  which directly contacts the gcc box  <cit> . the three hbsoloist genes only shared between 65% and 73% identity in their nucleotide sequences, which led us to consider these as three different hbsoloist genes and not as allelic forms. although the three hbsoloist genes have only a single ap <dig> domain, they formed a group and clustered together with the ap <dig> family, as has been reported in vitis vinifera <cit> . the greater conservation in amino acid sequences than in nucleotides, especially for the ap <dig> domain, revealed an evolutionary constraint suggesting a putative function for hevea soloists since there were recent duplications. however, no functional information has been published for soloist genes.

based on an analysis of  <dig> ap <dig> domain sequences of erf genes from three species, ten amino acid residues were shown to be strictly group-specific for all erf groups except for group ii and group viii. a previous study on  <dig> ap <dig> domain sequences from arabidopsis, gossypium and oryza led to the identification of  <dig> group-specific residues with a certain error rate  <cit> . the group-specific residues reported in this study could be proposed as a group marker of the erf family for several species. in addition, hevea ap2/erf genes harboured unique group-specific residues in their ap <dig> domain, such as vi-l , which are not found in other species. this difference could be explained by the distance between gossypium and arabidopsis in the eurosides ii  and hevea in the eurosides i   <cit> . we also identified that position  <dig> was conserved in hevea, arabidopsis, gossypium, populus with t <dig>  t <dig> and v <dig> for the erf, ap <dig> and rav families, respectively. position  <dig> directly contacts with dna. these interactions determine the geometry of the gcc-box binding domain  relative to dna and thereby comprise a framework for specific base recognition  <cit> .

several ap2/erf genes highly expressed in latex could be related to a specific function in hevea
ap2/erf genes are regulated by developmental processes and environmental cues  <cit> . as rubber trees are subjected to frequent mechanical wounding and osmotic stress upon tapping to collect latex, and ethephon stimulation to increase latex yield, some of these transcription factors are likely to play a unique role in hevea defence mechanisms and latex production. latex cells are differentiated in phloem tissue from cambium  <cit> . members of the ap <dig> family play an important role in angiosperm reproductive organ development  <cit> . members of the rav family were reported to be induced in ethylene response and in brassinosteroid response and to be involved in flower senescence  <cit> . consequently, the ap <dig> and rav genes present in latex are suggested to play an important role in hevea development.

several of the fifty-one erf transcripts accumulated in latex could be related to responses to stress. high read abundance was found in latex for erf groups ii, vii and viii. latex cells are differentiated in roots, leaves and bark. this might explain why genes expressed in latex could also be identified in the other tissues. in addition, thirteen other transcripts were highly accumulated in latex compared with other tissues: one for the ap <dig> family, one for the rav family and eleven for the erf family. the erf transcripts highly accumulated in latex were distributed as follows: one for group i, four for group ii, two for group vii and four for group viii. large number of genes was identified for groups vii, viii and ix with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively.

a few members of the ap2/erf superfamily have been previously reported in hevea. the hberf <dig>  hberf <dig>  hberf <dig> and hbrav <dig> genes were suggested to be induced by ja in bark during ja-induced laticifer differentiation  <cit> . according to our analysis, the hberf <dig>  hberf <dig> and hberf <dig> genes corresponded to hberf-viia <dig>  hberf-viia <dig> and hberf-viia <dig> in our classification with 99%, 98%, 99% identity, respectively. the hbcbf <dig> gene  <cit> , and the hbcbf <dig> gene  <cit>  have been reported to be regulated by cold and drought stresses, like other members of the dreb subfamily. we classified these genes in erf group iii. the hbcbf <dig> gene corresponded to the hberf-iiic <dig> gene with an identity of 100%, and the hbcbf <dig> gene to the hberf-iiib <dig> gene with 82% identity. another member of the ap2/erf superfamily is the hberebp <dig> gene recently identified by chen et al. from hevea laticifers  <cit> . this gene was down-regulated by tapping and mechanical wounding in laticifers from adult trees, and was also regulated by both exogenous ethephon or methyl jasmonate treatments. this suggests that the hberebp <dig> gene may be a negative regulator of defence mechanisms in laticifers  <cit> . the hberebp <dig> gene corresponded to the hberf-viiia <dig> gene with 100% identity in our analysis.

eleven new micrornas are predicted to inhibit hevea ap2/erf transcripts
the mode of action of mir172-regulated ap <dig> genes has been well described in reproductive and vegetative organs as well as in the transition of developmental phases  <cit> , where multiple feedback loops involve the micrornas mir156e targeting squamosa promoter binding protein-like  and mir172b targeting ap <dig>  <cit> . seven gymnosperm ap <dig> homologs were found to contain a sequence corresponding to mir <dig> with an average identity of approximately  <dig> %, suggesting that mechanisms regulating gene expression using micrornas have been conserved over the three hundred million years since the divergence of gymnosperm and flowering plant lineages  <cit> . the cleavage site of mir <dig> is conserved between plant lineages and is located between the second ap <dig> domain and the 3′ terminus  <cit> . this site is also observed in hevea. however, mir <dig> regulates flowering time by down-regulating ap2-like target genes by a translational mechanism rather than by rna cleavage  <cit> , and could explain our failure in detecting cleaved hbap2- <dig> and hbap2- <dig> transcripts . in addition to mir <dig>  eleven other micrornas were predicted to inhibit hevea transcripts of twenty-nine hbap2/erf genes. seven microrna families were only found in various tissues of plantlets  <cit> , and five others only in the latex of mature trees, including three novel microrna families  . for the first time to our knowledge, both cleavage and translation inhibition were predicted with mir binding in the cds sequence and especially for  <dig> genes in the ap <dig> domain.

CONCLUSIONS
ngs sequencing of five tissue-type libraries led to the generation of transcriptome data from the broadest coverage of tissues in hevea compared with previous work done on latex, leaf and bark  <cit> . this allowed identifying  <dig> ap <dig> domain-containing transcripts, of which  <dig> had a full-length ap <dig>  we have proposed an optimized alignment and classification method enabling the use of ngs data with repeatable outputs. analysis of read abundance led to the prediction that erf genes play a major role in laticifers. a comparison with populus and vitis did not provide any specific features for woody species as assumed earlier  <cit> , but the ap <dig> family appeared to be well represented for these species. several ap2/erf genes highly expressed in latex could be related to a specific function in hevea. further studies focusing on latex cells should provide a clearer understanding of the involvement of genes from the ap2/erf superfamily in the regulation of latex production and latex cell differentiation. finally, analysis of allelic variations between transcript sequences of several hevea clones could be useful for the development of functional molecular markers.
