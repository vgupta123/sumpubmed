BACKGROUND
vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. out of the  <dig> serogroups of v. cholerae, only two biotypes of serogroup o <dig>  and serogroup o <dig> cause severe diarrhea and epidemic cholera  <cit> , although not all strains in these two serogroups are pathogenic. toxigenic and nontoxigenic v. cholerae strains are genetically diverse. the toxigenic strains form a genetically homogenous group, while nontoxigenic strains are heterogeneous and may have diverse origins  <cit> . the nontoxigenic strains, which are usually isolated from environmental sources such as sewage, oysters, and brackish water, do not carry cholera toxin  and other major virulence genes necessary for human pathogenesis  <cit> .

v. cholerae is capable of metabolizing many types of carbohydrates. previously, we found that not only is d-sorbitol metabolized by v. cholerae, but it is also fermented at different rates by the toxigenic and nontoxigenic el tor strains. the toxigenic strains have a low sorbitol fermentation rate and are called slow-fermenting strains, whereas the nontoxigenic strains have a faster sorbitol fermentation rate and are called fast-fermenting strains  <cit> . the sorbitol fermentation test is included in the phage-biotyping scheme, which consists of phage typing and biochemical typing and is developed in 1970s in china. this scheme is used to distinguish and type the el tor strains which are pathogenic and are potential to cause epidemic or not  <cit> . it is found that the o <dig> el tor strains isolated from patients and environmental samples in epidemics are toxigenic and sorbitol slow-fermenting, whereas the strains isolated from environment in non-epidemic periods are nontoxigenic and fast-fermenting.

in some bacteria, d-sorbitol is transported into the cell via the sorbitol specific phosphotransferase system  or some non-sorbitol specific pts, and then it is transformed from sorbitol-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and enters the fructose/mannitol metabolism pathway. all genes involved in the fructose/mannitol metabolism pathway in v. cholerae have been identified and annotated on the genome  <cit> , but the genes involved in sorbitol transportation and transformation are unknown http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?vch <dig>  though a previous study identified the differential proteins expressed in the presence or absence of sorbitol, based on which only the sorbitol induced proteins could be found  <cit> .

an investigation into the mechanism behind the different fermentation rates in toxigenic versus nontoxigenic v. cholerae strains may help to further the understanding of their genetic and evolutionary differences. here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance  and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  to identify differences in metabolites and proteins involved in sorbitol fermentation between toxigenic  and nontoxigenic  v. cholerae el tor strains. proteomics is a useful high-throughout technique and has been used in v. cholerae to construct proteome reference map  <cit> , protein expression analysis in the different culture environments  <cit>  and in the human host environment  <cit> . large genetic differences exist between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic v. cholerae based on the comparative genomic hybridization  <cit> , accordingly protein components of these strains will be much more divergent. the direct comparison of protein profiles of the fast- and slow-fermenting strains cultured in sorbitol fermentation medium will lead the confusion and misunderstanding of the proteins associated with the mechanisms of fermentation difference. fructose and sorbitol metabolisms share the same pathway after the fructose-6-phosphate step, and we found no differences in fructose fermentation rates between the sorbitol fast- and slow-fermenting strains, therefore in this study we used fructose as a control when comparing protein profiles, to exclude proteins constitutively involved in sugar metabolism. this approach allowed to identify differences in protein expression associated with sorbitol metabolism difference in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic v. cholerae strains. differences of formate production, fructose-6-phosphate production and subsequent metabolism were found to be causative mechanisms in the sorbitol fermentation difference in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic v. cholerae strains.

methods
bacterial strains
two v. cholerae strains of serogroup o <dig> el tor  were used to compare protein expression profiles by 2-de analysis. n <dig> is a toxigenic strain whose complete genome was previously published  <cit> , while js <dig> is a nontoxigenic strain isolated in  <dig> in china. an additional eight toxigenic strains  and three nontoxigenic strains  isolated in china were also included in this study .

sorbitol and fructose fermentation tests
fresh colonies cultured on luria-bertani  agar were selected and inoculated statically in  <dig> ml lb broth at 37°c for  <dig> hours, to reach the od <dig> of  <dig>  or  <dig> × 107cfu/ml equivalently. then  <dig> μl cultures were transferred into  <dig> ml fermentation media  and inoculated statically at 37°c. sugar fermentation was measured as the color change in the medium  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-inoculation   <cit> . considering the high concentration of sorbitol in the fermentation medium, fructose at a similar concentration was used as a control sugar in the proteome analysis to eliminate differences in nutrient usage, osmotic pressure and ph in the media with and without sorbitol. ph of the fermentation medium was measured with cpph 59003- <dig> .

1h-nmr
one milliliter of the fermentation media cultured with the test strains was collected and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at room temperature for  <dig> min to clarify the supernatant. the1h resonance of d2o  was used to lock the field and for shimming. tetramethylsilane was used as internal standard. nmr spectra were recorded on a varian inova  <dig> spectrometer  operating at  <dig> mhz with the following parameters: pulse  <dig>  degrees, mixing  <dig>  sec, acquire time  <dig>  sec,  <dig> khz spectral width, line broadening  <dig>  hz,  <dig> repetitions, ft size  <dig> 

comparative proteome analysis
v. cholerae strains n <dig> and js <dig> were cultured in  <dig> ml sorbitol or fructose fermentation media. the v. cholerae cell precipitates were washed with precooled low salt pbs  and disrupted and solubilized using lysis solution  and sonicated for  <dig> min on ice using the sonifier  <dig> . after centrifuging at  <dig>  × g 15°c for  <dig> min, supernatant aliquots were stored at -70°c and the protein concentration was determined with the plusone 2-d quant kit .

2-de was performed using the immobiline/polyacrylamide system and  <dig> cm ipg strips  . seven hundred microgram samples were loaded, and isoelectric focusing was conducted at 20°c for  <dig>  vhrs  on ipgphor . for the second dimension, vertical slab sds-page  was used . gels were stained using colloidal coomassie blue g- <dig> . three sample preparations were made for every strain, and each sample was repeated at least twice. images were analyzed using the image-master 2d elite .

in-gel protein digestion, maldi-tof-ms and protein identification
protein spots of interest were excised from the gels. after destaining, gel pieces were digested with trypsin  for  <dig> h at 37°c. the extracts were dried and resolubilized in  <dig> μl of  <dig> % tfa. peptide mass fingerprinting  measurements were performed on a bruker reflex™ iii maldi-tof mass spectrometer  working in reflectron mode with  <dig> kv of accelerating voltage and  <dig> kv of reflecting voltage. a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid  in 50% acetonitrile and  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid  was used for the matrix. mass accuracy for pmf analysis was  <dig> – <dig>  da with external calibration; internal calibration was carried out using enzyme autolysis peaks, and the resolution was  <dig> . database searches were performed using the software mascot v <dig> . <dig>  licensed in-house http://mascot.proteomics.com.cn/search_form_pmf.html against the database of v. cholerae n <dig> . monoisotopic peptide masses were used to search the databases with a mass tolerance of  <dig> ppm and one partial cleavage. oxidation of methionine and carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine was considered. scores greater than  <dig> were significant , with more than five peptides matched and sequence coverage greater than 15%.

RESULTS
dynamic change of the fermentation medium ph
we measured the ph of the sorbitol fermentation media of the strains during the fermentation test, by extracting  <dig> ml of the media serially at each time point, from a volume of  <dig> ml culture of each strain. the ph-time curves  demonstrate that the js <dig> sorbitol fermentation medium ph dropped gradually over time, while that of n <dig> leveled off at ph  <dig>  for about  <dig> hours before dropping again. the change in ph was consistent with the sorbitol fermentation test, showing that nontoxigenic strains display positive results earlier than toxigenic strains  <cit> .

1h-nmr analysis
in order to understand the differences in ph observed for the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains, we examined changes in medium components using 1h-nmr. the majority of the components in the sorbitol fermentation media exhibited similar depletion or formation for js <dig> and n <dig> . one exception was the appearance of two volatile compounds . formate appeared in the js <dig> culture earlier than in the n <dig> culture, and the different production rates of formate between these two v. cholerae strains were consistent with their ph changes and fermentation rates. at the time of color change in the js <dig> fermentation sample, the concentrations of acetic acid and formate in the medium were  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l . in contrast, the acetic acid concentration in n <dig> fermentation media was  <dig>  mg/l , and formate was below the level of detection.

comparative proteomic analysis
at the positive time point of the sorbitol fermentation test of js <dig> , whole cell proteins from four different cultures were prepared and separated by 2-de. these protein profiles were designated fn, sn, fj and sj, indicating samples prepared from n <dig> in fructose, n <dig> in sorbitol, js <dig> in fructose, and js <dig> in sorbitol fermentation medium, respectively.

on the sn and fn proteome profiles,  <dig> and  <dig> spots were identified, respectively, but only  <dig> spots had changed in abundance, in them  <dig> were more abundant in n <dig> cultured in sorbitol fermentation medium ,  <dig> were more abundant in sample of fn  . such similarity also existed in the sj and fj profiles, with  <dig> differential spots found,  <dig> were more abundant in samples of sj and fj respectively  . all of the  <dig> differential protein spots were analyzed by maldi-ms, and  <dig> spots significantly matched known proteins  . sixty-two percent of the spots were identified as proteins involved in energy metabolism and central intermediary metabolism, and six spots were identified as transport/binding proteins.

out of  <dig> total differential spots identified in the sn/fn and sj/fj comparisons,  <dig> common signified potential proteins of these two comparison groups may be involved in the difference between the sorbitol and fructose metabolism pathway: amino acid abc transporter, perosamine synthase, malate dehydrogenase, aminotransferase nifs, heat shock protein htpg, succinyl-coa synthase, fiia, glycerol kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and oxygen-insensitive nadh nitroreductase. three of these proteins h nitroreductase, and fiia) were more abundant in sorbitol medium.

two proteins within the identified  <dig> spots, the fiia protein of pts system and mannitol-1-p dehydrogenase , may be involved in the transportation and transformation of sorbitol. fiia was a common differential protein observed in the comparisons of sn/fn and sj/fj, both of which were more abundant in the sorbitol medium than in the fructose medium . mtld was more abundant in sorbitol than in fructose fermentation medium of the sorbitol fast-fermenting strain js <dig>  but was not found difference in sn/fn comparison of the sorbitol slow-fermenting strain n <dig> , suggesting its potential role in the sorbitol metabolism difference between these two strains. two different pi forms of it were also found in sj sample . two proteins, pyruvate dehydrogenase and pfl, were also found differences in the comparison of sorbitol to fructose fermentation in js <dig> and n <dig>  pyruvate dehydrogenase was more abundant in sj of sj/fj comparison but less abundant in sn of sn/fn comparison, and pfl was more abundant in both fj and fn . these two enzymes were both involved in pyruvate transformation, and pfl catalyzes pyruvate to produce formate. their different expression may suggest their roles in formate production in the sorbitol fast- and slow-fermenting strains. in addition, the haemolysin and hcp proteins, which are related to v. cholerae pathogenicity, were also abundant spots on the sn gel, showing higher expression levels in n <dig> 

sequencing of the vca <dig> gene
due to the observed differences on the 2-de gels , the vca <dig> gene from all toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains studied were amplified and sequenced . all of the sequences contained three predicted conserved domains: the fructose specific pts eiia component, the eiia component of pts, and the hpr protein. the sequences of the nine toxigenic strains were highly similar but differed from the nontoxigenic strains, while three of four nontoxigenic strains had identical sequences. a comparison of amino acid residues of the nontoxigenic and toxigenic strains revealed changes mainly localized at the spacer region between the latter two domains. nearly all of these residues involved changes in the polarity or acid-alkalinity of the amino acid . three of the four nontoxigenic strains  lacked a  <dig> nucleotide  region  from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the pis of their proteins changed from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this data was consistent with the appearance of the fiia protein spots on the 2-de gels. the nontoxigenic strain 60– <dig> did not lack the  <dig> nt fragment, but amino acid mutations placed it in the farthest phylogenetic cluster from the other strains .

qrt-pcr of vc <dig> and vc2414
pfl  and pyruvate dehydrogenase  were identified as spots in the proteomic analysis  and are involved in the production of fermentation acids. we monitored transcription levels at four time points during the fermentation assay. the transcription levels of both vc <dig> and vc <dig> of js <dig> were higher than those of n <dig> in sorbitol fermentation medium at  <dig> hrs and reversed at  <dig> hrs . when comparing the relative transcription levels of vc <dig> to vc <dig> of js <dig> and n <dig> , we found that the relative transcription of vc <dig> of js <dig> was higher than of n <dig> at all time points. js <dig> transcription of vc <dig> reached a peak five-fold increase at  <dig> hrs, whereas n <dig> transcription was only increased two-fold. no wonder the fast-fermenting strain js <dig> showed much higher production of formate than did the slow-fermenting strain n <dig> 

discussion
nontoxigenic v. cholerae strains ferment sorbitol at a faster rate than toxigenic strains, one of phenotyping included in the phage-biotyping, which has been widely used as a typing scheme in cholera surveillance for many years in china and has been confirmed by thousands of strains  <cit> . to understand the mechanism of this difference in sorbitol fermentation rate, here we compared the expression of proteins involved in sorbitol fermentation in toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. the proteome profiles of the cells cultured in sorbitol and fructose medium were very similar with few differential spots, indicating that the status of the cells in these two conditions was similar. therefore, we could subtract the most commonly expressed constitutive proteins not related to sorbitol fermentation when comparing sn/fn and sj/fj. this approach identified two pts proteins and two proteins involved in formate production.

in general, the specificity of sugar ptss lies in their eiia component, while the hpr protein and ei enzyme are encoded by independent genes and are commonly used by different sugar pts systems. in the conservative domain analysis of the v. cholerae vca <dig> gene, we found that this eiia component was larruping and it contained three conservative domains, two of which are not sugar-specific. the sequences of the three domains were almost completely identical for all tested strains, further demonstrating their highly conserved nature. we conjectured that the low specificity of the co-expressed hpr and eiia domains endowed the vca <dig> gene product with a role in sorbitol utilization. contrary to the conservation of the domains, the entire vca <dig> gene sequences of the  <dig> tested strains showed obvious differences between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains, with the variable amino acid residues located at the spacer region between the domains. these differences may impact the steric conformation and the regulation of this protein, and further impact the efficiency of sorbitol transportation. the regulation of transcription, which maybe also affects the expression of vca <dig> in the sorbitol fast-fermenting and slow-fermenting strains, should also be considered

mtld catalyses the transformation of mannitol-1-p to fructose-6-p, the later enters the fructose metabolism pathway. mannitol and sorbitol are very similar in molecular structure. in pseudomonas fluorescens, sorbitol is transported by the mannitol pts system and transformed by polyol dehydrogenase, which has a broad substrate spectrum  <cit> . in a previous study we confirmed the transcriptions of the n <dig> vca <dig> gene in sorbitol and mannitol fermentation media  <cit> . here, our results indicate that two non-sorbitol specific ptss are involved in the v. cholerae sorbitol utilization process. this may be similar to the uptake of l-sorbose in lactobacillus casei where l-sorbose is mainly taken up via eiisor and eiiman plays a secondary role  <cit> . in bacillus subtilis, mtld is required for sorbitol assimilation in addition to the gut operon  <cit> . interestingly, both of these ptss are located on chromosome ii of v. cholerae. several studies indicate that the two chromosomes of v. cholerae are heterologous and that chromosome ii may be a megaplasmid captured by an ancestral v. cholerae  <cit> . the ability to ferment sorbitol used to differentiate v. cholerae strains may provide clues as to both the origins and genetic variation of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains.

the traditional sorbitol fermentation test is a phenotypic method using phenol red as the indicator. in our study, we showed that the observed differences in sorbitol fermentation rates were the result of changes in the production rate of formate in the fast-fermenting and slow-fermenting strains. the fact that the ratio of formate to acetic acid was not consistent between the two strains also indicated that, besides the differences early in the metabolic pathway , pyruvate catabolism could be different in sorbitol fermentation in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. both pyruvate dehydrogenase and pfl can catalyze the transformation of pyruvate to acetyl-coa, but they have different electron acceptors and outputs. their activities affect the relative proportion of the end products  <cit> . pyruvate dehydrogenase produces co <dig> in addition to acetyl-coa, while formate is the product of pfl. in the proteomic and qrt-pcr analyses of this study, the respective expression and transcription levels of these two genes were significantly different in the fast-fermenting js <dig> and slow-fermenting n <dig>  consistent with this fact was that formate was produced earlier in js <dig> than in n <dig>  in a previous study, we had confirmed that the sequences of vc <dig> including the promoter region of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains could be identical . the differential transcription or metabolism of pyruvate was not at vc <dig> gene level and there must be a regulation mechanism, which acts at the pyruvate point, differs between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains.

the most important difference between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains is the presence or absence of the cholera toxin gene ctxab. when we deleted ctxab from the toxigenic strains or complemented ctxab via plasmid into the nontoxigenic strains, we did not observe the reversion of the sorbitol fermentation rate when comparing the mutants with the wild-type strains . in the proteomic analysis, we identified two virulence-related proteins. among them, hemolysin has a predominant role in lethality and confers v. cholerae the ability to prevent clearance and establish prolonged colonization without a requirement for cholera toxin or toxin-coregulated pili  <cit> . v. cholerae hcp protein is a 28-kda secreted protein regulated coordinately with hemolysin. the expression of both proteins has been shown to promote expression of virulence determinants in vivo and increase ld <dig> in the infant mouse cholera model  <cit> . consistent with their co-regulation relationship, both hemolysin and hcp were more abundant in the n <dig> sorbitol culture profiles, suggesting that sorbitol induction and metabolism may have relationship with the regulation of the expression of virulent elements in v. cholerae.

CONCLUSIONS
we carried out a comparative analysis of the differences induced by sorbitol between toxigenic  and nontoxigenic  v. cholerae strains. our results suggest that the differential expression of the fiia protein and mtld of mannitol pts demonstrate changes in the transportation and metabolism of sorbitol, and that pyruvate dehydrogenase and pfl relate to the different production rate of the acid metabolites. the contribution and functional mechanisms of these proteins in the v. cholerae sorbitol fermentation pathway in toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains will require further study.
