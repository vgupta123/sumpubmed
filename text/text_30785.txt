BACKGROUND
a favorable genetic trend for total number of piglets born has been observed in the last decade  <cit> . therefore, selection pressure on the number of teats has been applied in order to provide enough teats for the larger litters. given the heritable nature of variation in number of teats in sheep as described by bell in  <dig>  <cit> , and cases of familial supernumerary breasts  or nipples  in humans  <cit> , genomic loci affecting teat number must exist. indeed, the use of best linear unbiased prediction  for estimating breeding values  using phenotypes of both females and males, has resulted in an increase of the number of teats  and heritability estimates are moderate with estimates between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . besides the use of quantitative genetics to select the best sows, many studies have used genetic markers - mainly microsatellites - to identify qtl . the qtl studies on number of teats  listed in the pig qtl database  <cit>  report qtl on all porcine chromosomes except ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and sscy. although many qtl were reported , they cover large regions and the functional mutations and underlying biological mechanisms have not yet been identified. interestingly, some qtl for nte seem to overlap with those for number of vertebrae  <cit> .

teats  develop each as an appendage to previously formed mammary gland rudiments  during pre-natal life  <cit> . therefore, the number of teats correlates with the number of mrs induced and maintained at least until teat formation. the number of mammary glands varies among mammalian species, but even in humans, who normally form one pair of breasts, there are at least  <dig> other positions that additional breasts can randomly occupy on either side of the body  <cit> . their positions range from armpit  to groin , thus span the same region where pigs form their mammary glands and teats. on both sides lateral to the ventral midline, one can draw imaginary fluent lines from both axillae to both inguenae, called mammary lines or milk lines. during embryonic life, these lines exist as histologically and molecularly distinct bands in the surface ectoderm, connecting all positions where mammary glands may form on either side of the body in any given mammalian species .

studies on genetically engineered mice  have revealed some insights in genetic and cellular mechanisms of mammary gland and nipple formation. whereas wild type mice normally form five pairs of mammary glands along the mammary lines  <cit> , modification of certain genes can alter this number  <cit> . for example, loss of either nrg <dig>  pax <dig>  gli <dig>  fgf <dig>  or hoxc6
 abolishes the formation of different, gene-specific, subsets of mrs  <cit> . deletion of e.g. p63
 <cit>  or tbx <dig>   <cit>  may abolish the formation of all five mrs, while reduction of wnt signaling by means of deletion of e.g. lef <dig>   <cit>  or pygo <dig>  allows mr induction but leads to mr regression prior to nipple formation  <cit> . even if the mrs are maintained, nipple formation may not occur due to e.g. a lack of pthrp  signaling  <cit> . conversely, ectodermal overexpression of the genes encoding the receptor ligands eda-a <dig>   <cit>  or nrg3
 <cit> , or suppression of the wnt-antagonists lrp <dig> or wise/sostdc <dig>  may lead to formation of one or several supernumerary mammary glands in a gene-specific pattern or region along the mammary line  <cit> . these data provide evidence for genetic determinants for the number of mammary glands, and moreover, for the positional variation in activity of, or requirement for, these genetic determinants along the mammary line  <cit> .

studies carried out in the 1960’s on rabbit and mouse embryos had revealed that mammary gland formation in the surface ectoderm is initiated by factors in the dermal mesenchyme underlying the surface ectoderm  <cit> . the dermal mesenchyme is derived from the somites, which are also the precursor structures for the vertebrae and ribs. interestingly, some of the genes mentioned above , are in wild type mice expressed in the somites and/or in the dermal mesenchyme. it is now known that induction of the third pair of mrs in mice, mr <dig>  depends on gli3-mediated fgf <dig> expression in the somites  <cit> . somitic expression of raldh <dig>  an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis, has also been associated with induction of mr <dig>  <cit> .with this relationship between somitic gene expression and the number of mrs induced in mouse embryos; and knowing that somites also give rise to the vertebrae, we may expect that some qtl and candidate genes for nte in pigs are associated with the number of vertebrae in pigs, or vertebrae development in mammalian species in general.

the availability of the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit>  allowed us to perform a genome-wide association study  for nte by genotyping  <dig> large white pigs. the better coverage of the whole pig genome by high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms  on these beadchips, combined with advanced statistical methods can improve fine mapping of specific qtl as demonstrated previously for other traits . in the current study, we based our analysis on deregressed breeding values  <cit>  to account for the dense family structure and a bayesian approach for estimation of the snp effects. a total of five highly significant qtl were identified at high resolution including new regions on sus scrofa chromosome   <dig> and ssc <dig>  interestingly, in three of these regions we identified genes regulating vertebrae development as candidate genes determining the number of teats.

RESULTS
identification of qtl for teat number
in total  <dig> pigs were originally genotyped, but  <dig> animals were removed during quality control of the data. the remaining  <dig> animals had an average call rate of  <dig> . the mean teat number was  <dig>   with a minimum of  <dig> and a maximum of  <dig> teats. a minimum of  <dig> teats is used as a breeding decision, which results in a slightly skewed distribution of the phenotype in this dataset. the  ebvs are normally distributed . the distribution of the weighting factors calculated for nte to account for heterogeneous variances are shown in figure  <dig>  the two distributions observed reflect the deviation between animals with or without offspring information. animals with a weighting factor below  <dig> have no offspring where the animals above one have on average  <dig> offspring with records on nte. the estimated heritability was  <dig> . the gwas resulted in  <dig> snps with a bf > <dig> of which  <dig> snps had a bf >  <dig> . in total  <dig> qtl regions were defined containing  <dig> snps on  <dig> chromosomes. one candidate qtl region showed an r <dig> higher than  <dig>  with another candidate qtl where the distance was over 2 mb . these regions were combined into one region .figure  <dig>

gene identification within qtl regions
within the qtl regions,  <dig> genes  were mapped . for the five highly significant qtl regions on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a bf near or larger than  <dig>  a search for candidate genes was performed. on ssc <dig> between  <dig> and 105 mb, a gene named vertnin  and encoding a potential dna binding factor, is located at  <dig>  mb. the number-increase allele  of this gene, was shown to add an additional thoracic segment to the pig compared to the wild-type   <cit> . among the  <dig> genes annotated to the qtl area on ssc <dig> explaining more than 1% of the genetic variance, is δ-ef <dig> mapping to  <dig>  mb. we consider this the most likely candidate gene, because it encodes transcriptional repressor involved in skeletal development  <cit> . on ssc <dig>  three candidate genes were identified between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. of these, mpp <dig>  is located at  <dig>  mb. it encodes a maguk  p <dig> subfamily member 7-like transcript, which is required for the establishment of cell polarity in the developing drosophila embryo  <cit> . also in cultured cells, mpp <dig> promotes epithelial cell polarity and tight junction formation  <cit> . the second candidate gene is armc <dig> at position  <dig>  mb. armc <dig> belongs to the ctnnb1-family of beta-catenins, which are well known for roles in transcriptional transduction of wnt signaling and tissue integrity via cell-cell adhesion. the third candidate gene is mkx  at  <dig>  mb, a homeobox gene which again acts as an important regulator of vertebrae development. for the two other qtl regions on ssc <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb and on ssc <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, no obvious candidate genes were identified.

discussion
strength of gwas methodology
in the present study, a bayesian variable selection approach was used to estimate snp effects. by using a relatively stringent prior  on average  <dig> snps per run are selected to have an effect on the trait. to secure that many snps have been in the π <dig> distribution, the number of cycles run was large . the advantage is that less snps are given a large variance and therefore we expect a clearer distinction between snps with a small effect and snps with a larger effect  <cit> . instead of a sliding window of n number of snps, which is often used to account for linkage disequilibrium   <cit> , regions were defined based on distances between significant snps  and ld for post-analyses. the number of snps within a region was variable between a single snp up to  <dig> snps. the defined region was used to simultaneously estimate the explained variance of the snps within the qtl region.

the use of deregressed ebv’s should also give more reliable results from the gwas resulting in a better estimation of the size of the snp effects  <cit> . use of only phenotypes in a gwas from the animals genotyped without considering the information of offspring, parents and other family members is reducing the power of the study. deregressed ebv’s are often used in dairy cattle breeding where daughter yield deviation  are used in gwas, which have similar properties to deregressed ebv’s  <cit> . deregressing breeding values is used to circumvent selecting snps which explain family relatedness rather than associated genes. this is done by removing the contribution of information from relatives.

reliability of identified qtl areas
in total  <dig> qtl regions were identified with relatively small effects, which suggest that nte is controlled by many genes. this is in agreement with earlier performed linkage studies where across different pig populations many qtl were found on almost all chromosomes. including the results from this study and published qtl, all chromosomes with the exception of ssc <dig> and the y chromosome, carry qtl for teat number. figure  <dig> also clearly shows that some qtl found in this study only have a limited contribution compared to the genetic variance explained by snps which were in the null distribution . this helps to distinguish whether the variance explained per chromosome is expected because snps have a small variance, or alternatively, whether there is a large qtl contributing to the chromosomal genetic variance. the expected variance explained per chromosome is proportional to the number of snps on the chromosome with the assumption that no qtl is located on the chromosome, for example on ssc <dig>  the difference between the total chromosomal genetic variance and the expected variance when snps are in the null distribution plus the qtl variance, can be caused by snps that were selected  but did not reach the significance level to be assigned to a qtl region. the genetic variance explained by the defined qtl region on ssc <dig> might even be an underestimation due to snps which are in ld with the qtl region, but did not reach the significance threshold of a bf > <dig>  in general, the explained variance by the identified qtl regions is small. several factors could be underlying the relatively small explained variance. the size of this study is moderate in livestock and small compared to human studies  <cit> . a larger sample size could pick up more rare variants, additionally a larger snp set  will have the snp closer to the causative mutation and will give more statistical power to the association study  <cit> . the trait nte has also been under selection for at least 10 years , which could have resulted in rapid fixation of large segregating qtl. additionally, nte is a categorical trait and not directly measuring the variation of the underlying physiological factors of the developmental signalling chain.

most of the qtl regions identified in this study reside within published qtl for nte on several chromosomes . in figure  <dig>  a detailed overview of all the published qtl compared to the results from this study are shown . overall, the regions identified in this study are much smaller, as a result of using high-density snp information in a gwas instead of microsatellites as in a linkage study.figure  <dig>

especially on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> some qtl are located relatively close to each other. we identify them as small individual qtl regions rather than one large qtl, because the ld  between the snps is less than  <dig> . besides region  <dig> on ssc <dig>  the r <dig> between the closely identified qtl was always below  <dig> , which suggests the qtl should be considered as independent genomic regions.

candidate qtl and genes
the qtl which explains the most genetic variation is located on ssc <dig> and has been identified in other studies  <cit> . while mikawa et al.  <cit>  reported an additive effect of this qtl on number of vertebrae, we observed a dominant or even overdominant effect on the number of teats in our population. this is in accordance with a previous study reporting that breeding for increased body length also resulted in increased teat number, leading to the speculation that the number of vertebrae is genetically linked to the number of teats  <cit> . within this qtl we identified a gene named vertnin  at  <dig>  mb, which likely provides such a genetic link. the likeliness of vertnin’s candidature is strongly supported by the previous demonstration that structural integrity of the somites, as well as somitic expression of genes such as gli <dig> and fgf <dig>  are required for the proper formation of the mammary line and glands at the axial level of thoracic/abdominal transition in mice  <cit> . mechanistically, the genetic linkage between numbers of vertebrae and teats can be explained by the somites being precursors for vertebrae as well as dermal mesenchyme, the latter inducing mammary gland formation in the overlying surface ectoderm  <cit> .

another candidate gene in the region is prox <dig>  a vertebrate homolog of the drosophila homeobox-containing gene prospero prox <dig> belongs to a family of transcription factors whose function has not yet been characterized in detail in mammals. in zebrafish, prox <dig> is mainly expressed in the brain and involved in eye development  <cit> . notably, both vertnin and prox <dig> have recently been proposed as candidates for the number of vertebrae in a white duroc x chinese erhualian intercross, that also carries two different haplotypes for increased teat number  <cit> .

the second largest qtl effect explaining more than 1% of the genetic variance is located on ssc <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. although many studies have found a qtl for nte on ssc <dig>  <cit> , only guo et al.  <cit>  found a large qtl interval similar to ours in an f <dig> cross between large white and chinese meishan. within this region, we find the δ-ef <dig> gene is of particular interest because its expression in the somites  <cit>  may suggest a role in vertebrae and mammary development in a mechanism similar to vertnin, as described above.

on ssc <dig>  we found a significant qtl in the same region as in other studies  <cit>  or neighbouring a region found in other studies  <cit> . between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb within this region, we identified three candidate genes, namely mpp <dig>  armc <dig>  and mkx. in drosophila and in cultured cells, mpp <dig> promotes cell polarity and tight junction formation  <cit> . while a role for mpp <dig> and tight junctions in early mammary gland development has not yet been studied, cell polarization and tissue stratification are integral part of mammary induction and early growth, as observed in mice  <cit> , supporting the candidature involvement of mpp <dig> establishment of gland/teat number. as a member of the β-catenin gene family, armc <dig> could be involved in mammary gland formation via its role in transcriptional transduction of wnt/β-catenin signaling. a role for this signaling pathway in early mammary gland formation is demonstrated by compromised mammary gland formation in the presence of pathway-inhibitory mutations, and supernumerary mammary gland formation in the context of excessive wnt signaling . alternatively, wnt signaling is implicated downstream of pthrp signaling in nipple formation, which is a process that occurs secondary to the formation of mammary rudiments  <cit> .

most convincing, the third gene mkx is in mice expressed in the condensing mesenchyme that will ultimately become the proximal ribs and vertebral bodies  <cit> .

the two other qtl regions on ssc <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb and on ssc <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb are new and have not been reported before. soma et al.  <cit>  reported a qtl for number of lumbar vertebrae on ssc <dig> around  <dig>  mb  in a duroc purebred population, but the qtl peak is located around 55 mb further distal of our qtl no.  <dig> .

elongation of the back and an increased number of vertebrae in pigs as a consequence of domestication was already observed by charles darwin  <cit> . signatures of selection have also been found for numbers of vertebrae and body length in the domestic pig  <cit>  and for number of teats  <cit> . in accordance, some qtl for number of vertebrae and number of teats in pigs overlap  <cit> . a mutation increasing number of teats in the gene nr6a <dig>  on ssc <dig> has been fixed in commercial breeds  <cit>  and therefore, this qtl is not segregating in our population either. nevertheless, selection for increased carcass length still provides variation for genetic improvement of reproductive traits such as number of teats in the sow which is in turn very relevant for the survival of piglets.

mechanistically, the link between carcass length  and number of teats can be explained by results from studies in mice, revealing a role for the somites, i.e. precursor structures for vertebrae, in the induction of mammary gland development  <cit> . although to our knowledge, a variation in number of somites  in mice has not been subject to study in mice, and certainly not in relationship to the number of mammary glands or nipples/teats, it is clear that altered somitic development or gene expression can alter the number of mammary glands  in mice  <cit> . in agreement with this biological mechanism of mammary gland development, we identified in our current study several candidate genes with a known association to vertebrae development. to date, none of these genes have a reported role in mammary gland or nipple/teat development. such studies could certainly be helpful to get closer to the causative genetic variant which can be used in breeding programs for increased nte in pigs.

CONCLUSIONS
although nte has been under selection for many generations, this study found many qtl controlling nte. we could narrow down considerably some of the earlier published qtl regions making it easier to select candidate genes. five major qtl were found at high resolution on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of which the qtl on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> are the first ones to be reported on these chromosomes. the confirmed major qtl found on ssc <dig> contains the candidate gene vertnin which has been reported to control the number of thoracic vertebrae. interestingly, also the two other regions on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> contain genes that have a suspected  or demonstrated  involvement in vertebrae development. the genetic relation between teat number and number of vertebrae can be explained by the somites being precursors for both vertebrae and dermal mesenchyme, while both the somites and dermal mesenchyme have been shown to contain inductive signals for mammary gland formation. all significant qtl together explain almost 10% of the genetic variance. nevertheless, results clearly show the polygenic nature of the trait indicating the genetic complexity of the trait. the significant snps found in this study could be used in selection to increase nte in pigs, so that the increasing number of live-born piglets can be nursed by the sow.
