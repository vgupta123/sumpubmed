BACKGROUND
oomycetes are fungal-like heterokonts that are principally known as plant pathogens  <cit> . the most extensively studied oomycete genus, phytophthora, includes the irish potato famine pathogen, p. infestans, and remains responsible for serious economic losses to crops worldwide  <cit> . although over 60 % of all described oomycetes are recognized as plant pathogens, recent evidence has suggested that oomycetes evolved from a marine animal pathogen  <cit> , and that phytopathogenicity was acquired independently as a derived, apomorphic trait in multiple oomycete clades  <cit> . the transition to plant pathogenicity has been associated with a dramatic expansion of the crinkler  gene family in the genomes of phylogenetically distant phytopathogenic oomycetes, such as the peronosporalean p. infestans and the saprolegnialean aphanomyces euteiches  <cit> . in accordance with this hypothesis, crn genes were shown to be absent from genome sequences generated from basal  oomycetes  <cit> . canonical crn effector proteins are characterized by the conserved lxlyla or lxlfla motifs at the n terminal, which have been implicated in the transport of these proteins in the host cells during plant infection. following translocation in the host cells, crn proteins accumulate in the nucleus, where they induce cell death  <cit> .

the entomopathogen lagenidium giganteum represents a unique, extant animal pathogenic oomycete that has been shown to express canonical crn oomycete effector genes  <cit> . this observation, combined with phylogenetic analyses that placed l. giganteum nested within a peronosporalean clade of plant pathogens, suggested that l. giganteum evolved from a plant pathogenic ancestor, and may have reverted back towards a plesiomorphic-like state. the presence of crn sequences in the l. giganteum transcriptome contrasted with historic observations describing this oomycete as a mosquito pathogen with a narrow range of invertebrate hosts, and little impact on plant tissues  <cit> . interestingly, the true nature of the l. giganteum host range has also been recently challenged by reports of l. giganteum infections in mammals  <cit> . these reports have diminished the potential of l. giganteum as a biocontrol agent against mosquitoes. however, they also have contributed to reinforce the original assertions that l. giganteum is defined as a mosquito pathogen, since this characteristic phenotypical feature was used to complement molecular-based phylogenetic analyses, and validate the identification of mammalian pathogenic lagenidium spp. as l. giganteum  <cit> . both historic  <cit>  and recent  <cit>  isolations of l. giganteum have demonstrated that one of the most characteristic attributes of this organism is its ability to infect and kill mosquito larvae, legitimating the hypothesis that the l. giganteum genome represents a valuable source of novel bioactive compounds with potential as bioinsecticides against mosquitoes  <cit> .

an alternative hypothesis that reconciles the presence of crn genes in the l. giganteum transcriptome and its pathogenicity to animals, proposes that crn proteins may play a role during mosquito infection  <cit> . this hypothesis is mainly supported by the fact that crn genes have been detected in the genome of the chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which is predominantly known as a devastating frog pathogen that threatens natural amphibian populations worldwide  <cit> . differential gene expression analyses indicated that bdcrn genes were up-regulated in the presence of frog skin  <cit> , suggesting that crn proteins may represent pathogenicity factors that are also active on animal cells. parallel investigations of crn proteins originating from bd and the plant pathogen oomycete aphanomyces euteiches have focused on one specific crn sequence, known as crn <dig>  <cit> , and have demonstrated that homologous proteins of different origins shared similar functions at the molecular level , concentrate to similar location in the respective host cells , and lead to similar outcomes . the l. giganteum crn proteins have yet to be included in such comparative analyses, and it remains unclear if they include a crn <dig> homolog, and if they have any role in the pathogenicity process. overall, the molecular processes mediating mosquito infections by l. giganteum remain uncharacterized. a recent study reported that l. giganteum secretes gh5_ <dig> enzymes that appear to be mostly specific to cuticle degrading entomopathogens, including not only entomopathogenic oomycetes but also fungi  <cit> . earlier reports have proposed trehalases as potential pathogenicity factors, based on the observations that trehalose is the most abundant sugar source in insects’ hemolymph, and that trehalose depletion may contribute to the l. giganteum infection process and ultimate death of the insect host  <cit> .

in this study, an on-going survey of the l. giganteum genome and transcriptome was used to characterize the l. giganteum gene sequences for crn <dig> and trehalase  orthologs. the crn <dig> and gh <dig> nucleotide sequences provided a basis to initiate differential gene expression studies, and estimate if these genes are up-regulated in the presence of aedes aegypti mosquito larvae, which are demonstrated natural hosts for l. giganteum  <cit> . the differential expression studies were performed in an effort to develop comparative analyses between bd and l. giganteum, and establish if crn <dig> proteins represent virulence factors shared by unrelated animal pathogens. the gene expression analyses presented herein also included the previously reported l. giganteum oomycete effector genes , as well as the entomopathogen-specific gh5_ <dig> gene  <cit> . finally, a novel l. giganteum glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  enzyme is reported in this study. several gh <dig> gene fragments were detected in the on-going l. giganteum transcriptome survey using a previously published screening rationale  <cit> . the fragment sequences exhibited little similarity with publicly available oomycete sequences. therefore, the complete coding region was generated and the gh <dig> gene was incorporated in the gene expression analyses. overall, this study provides insight into the gene expression profiling of an oomycete principally known as an animal pathogen. it anticipates the upcoming release and analysis of the l. giganteum genome sequence, and contributes to the development of workflows aimed at the identification and functional characterization of virulence factors with potential biological activities against mosquitoes.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of l. giganteum crn <dig> homologs
the use of the crn <dig> primers in internal and race pcrs revealed two different crn <dig> homologs for l. giganteum . the complete sequences of these two transcripts were 1341 bp and 1260 bp long, respectively, and were deposited in the genbank/embl/ddbj databases under the accession numbers kx <dig> and kx <dig>  homology searches demonstrated that the c terminals of both predicted protein sequences contained the dfa and ddc putative oomycete effector subdomains . these subdomains were recently further characterized in the oomycete aphanomyces euteiches and the chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis  <cit> . the hnh-like motif that was identified in crn <dig> proteins and associated with host dna binding properties  <cit>  was also conserved in l. giganteum, and located within the dfa subdomains. only one of the two l. giganteum sequences  displayed the canonical lxlylar/k and hvlvxxp motifs that are characteristic of the n terminal regions of oomycete crn genes. these domains have been implicated with protein transfer into the host plant cells  <cit> , and, in agreement with these observations, the crn homologs of the animal pathogen b. dendrobatidis have been mostly associated with two distinct n terminal motifs referred to as type a and type b  <cit> . homology searches aimed at characterizing the non-canonical l. giganteum protein  did not reveal any similarity between the l. giganteum and b. dendrobatidis crn <dig> n-terminals, and indicated that both l. giganteum proteins, including n terminals, showed stronger identities to crn or crn-like proteins reported from phytopththora spp. . sequence analyses demonstrated that the l. giganteum crn <dig> homologs did not contain identifiable signal peptides, mirroring previous observations reported for other l. giganteum crn homologs  <cit> . further analyses indicated that the l. giganteum crn <dig> protein sequences were not associated with non-classical secretory pathways, with nn scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>    <cit> .

characterization of the l. giganteum gh <dig> and gh <dig> transcripts
in contrast to the crn <dig> proteins, signal peptides were predicted for the l. giganteum gh <dig> and gh <dig> homologs. race pcrs produced complete transcript sequences that were 1973 bp and 1968 bp-long for gh <dig> and gh <dig>  respectively. the sequences were deposited in the genbank/embl/ddbj databases under the accession numbers kx <dig>  and kx <dig> . motif searches using interproscan demonstrated that the signal peptides preceded a single glycoside hydrolase  domain for both predicted proteins. the domains were further identified as gh family  <dig>  or gh family  <dig> , which have been associated with β-hexosaminidase  and trehalase  activities, respectively. in addition, gh <dig> enzymes have also been linked to chitinase activity, and exoskeleton degrading processes in insects and crustaceans  <cit> . homology searches and genome mining demonstrated that trehalase genes were widespread in oomycetes, as previously reported  <cit> , and indicated that the l. giganteum gh <dig> protein sequence shared 56 % identity with homologous proteins from the plant pathogens phytophthora infestans and p. nicotianae, and 49 % sequence identity with trehalase proteins from the fish pathogen saprolegnia parasitica. in contrast, gh <dig> genes appeared completely absent from plant pathogens, and have been identified only in a small sample of animal pathogenic oomycetes, including s. parasitica and the decapod parasite achlya hypogyna  <cit> . genome mining using the fungidb database confirmed that oomycete gh <dig> orthologs have only been reported in the saprolegnialeans, and revealed that these genes are virtually restricted to animal pathogens. a total of six gh <dig> protein sequences were retrieved from public databases, and these sequences originated from the fish pathogens s. parasitica , s. diclina  and aphanomyces invadans , the crayfish pathogen a. astaci , the decapod parasite ac. hypogyna  and the free living thraustotheca clavata . although all  <dig> saprolegnialean sequences shared significant similarity , preliminary sequence comparisons performed through homology searches indicated that the predicted l. giganteum gh <dig> protein sequence was more similar to plant sequences than all other oomycete sequences, and prompted more comprehensive phylogenetic analyses.

gh <dig> phylogenetic analysis
the phylogram inferred from the maximum likehood  analyses is presented in fig.  <dig>  the phylogenetic tree was rooted with bacterial gh <dig> proteins, and its topology was very consistent with the consensus tree obtained from bayesian analyses , confirming observations that ml and bayesian analyses correlate with one another, generally outperforming other methods such as maximum parsimony  <cit> . in addition, both trees were congruent with previously published eukaryotic gh <dig> protein phylogeny reconstructions inferred from ml and bayesian analyses  <cit> . especially, the trees depicted very strongly supported clades corresponding to multiple paralogous subfamilies of fungal, plant or animal gh <dig> enzymes . sequences from each of these groups are split between pairs of monophyletic, strongly supported clusters , suggesting a potential gene duplication event in the common ancestor of plants, animals and fungi  <cit> . fungal and plant clusters are respectively labeled as fungal clades  <dig> and  <dig>  and plant clades  <dig> and  <dig> , following a previously proposed nomenclature  <cit> . similarly, animal sequences are divided into two clusters that include the vertebrate gh <dig> alpha and beta chains as sister clades , and an arthropod-specific gh <dig> clade . deeper nodes, indicative of the relationships between the different clades, were characterized by weak statistical support in both current  and previous  <cit>  analyses. however, similar patterns emerging from both studies included the observations that fungal clade  <dig> and plant clade  <dig> clustered as sister clades, and that animal clade  <dig> and plant clade  <dig> appeared more closely related to each other than any other clades .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood  phylogram inferred from eukaryotic glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  amino acid sequences . the tree is consistent with previously published gh <dig> phylogeny reconstructions, and shows that oomycete gh <dig> proteins  cluster in two distinct groups. the saprolegnialean sequences appear as a strongly supported cluster nested within an arthropod-specific clade . in contrast, the l. giganteum sequence appears as a sister taxon to a plant clade . all but one sequences were retrieved from animal pathogenic oomycete genomes, as gh <dig> were shown to be absent from plant pathogenic oomycetes. numbers above the modes correspond to ml bootstrap values . numbers below the nodes correspond to bayesian posterior probabilities . asterisks indicate changes in topology between trees inferred from ml or bayesian analyses. for clarity purposes, not all values representative of the support for nodes within each major clade are shown. the bar indicates the number of substitutions per site




in all analyses, the phylogenetic trees depicted the l. giganteum gh <dig> protein as a sister taxon to the plant clade  <dig> . plant clade  <dig> includes proteins with known exochitinase  <cit>  and insecticidal activities  <cit> . in particular, corn tissues genetically modified to express the arabidopsis thaliana gh <dig> bae <dig> transcript caused mortality or reduced growth rate of pest insects  <cit> , suggesting that the l. giganteum gh <dig> proteins could have similar effects on the mosquito hosts. the l. giganteum gh <dig> sequence also appeared as a close relative to other heterokont, but non-oomycete, sequences from blastocystis hominis and phaeodactylum tricornutum . these relationships suggest that the l. giganteum homolog represents an ancestral gene sequence. although they appear as a paraphyletic assemblage, and not a monophyletic group , the position of heterokont sequences  as close relatives to plant sequences is consistent with recent reconstructions of eukaryote phylogeny  <cit> , and supports the hypothesis that the l. giganteum gh <dig> gene was acquired vertically.

the oomycete gh <dig> sequences from saprolegnialeans were not associated to any other heterokont sequences . they appeared as a strongly supported monophyletic clade, and this clade was nested within the arthropod-specific animal clade  <dig> . this topology suggests that the saprolegnialean gh <dig> gene was acquired from a lateral gene transfer event from an arthropod to the saprolegnialean ancestor. although a recent study focused on oomycete ancestral secretome identified multiple candidate genes acquired by oomycetes via horizontal gene transfer, the gh <dig> gene was not included in this report  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis presented in our study  provides a basis to initiate further phylogeny reconstructions to support the hypothesis of an animal to oomycete gene transfer. in particular, the addition of non-insect, invertebrate sequences may complement the single fenneropenaeus chinensis  sequence, and provide improved resolution for the nodes that appear only moderately supported by statistical analyses . since some of the sampled saprolegnialean oomycetes  are known pathogens of crustaceans, a testable hypothesis of refined phylogeny reconstructions may focus on a host-to-pathogen lateral gene transfer, confirming previous reports that such transfers are important events contributing to the evolution of pathogenic traits  <cit> .

even if the origin of these genes remains to be comprehensively determined, genome mining demonstrated that gh <dig> genes are shared by all animal pathogenic oomycetes  and are absent from plant pathogen genomes. the gh <dig> proteins were predicted to be secreted by all animal pathogens. in addition, phylogenetic analyses strongly suggested that the l. giganteum gh <dig> proteins may display chitinase and insecticidal activities. in order to provide further evidence that the gh <dig> proteins have a role in mosquito infection, the gene expression pattern of the l. giganteum gh <dig> gene was investigated.

differential gene expression analysis
the differential expression analyses were preceded by the identification of a l. giganteum intron in a conserved location of the 5’ end of the cellulose synthetase  <dig> gene  <cit> . this 76 bp long intron was amplified and sequenced from genomic dna preparations, and the sequence was deposited in the genbank/embl/ddbj databases under the accession number kx <dig>  importantly, the presence of a conserved intron allowed for control reactions  that confirmed the absence of gdna contamination in all the l. giganteum cdna preparations that were used to determine gene expression profiles in the absence vs. presence of mosquito hosts. the gene expression analyses are presented in fig.  <dig>  these analyses revealed that four out of the eight tested l. giganteum genes were significantly differentially expressed, and showed increased expression, in the presence of mosquito larvae . independent samples t tests indicated that, relative to a ratio of  <dig>  gene expression was significantly increased for all the glycoside hydrolases proposed as virulence factors to date, including the invertebrate specific gh5_ <dig> , t = - <dig> , p <  <dig> , the newly identified gh <dig> , t = - <dig> , p <  <dig> , and gh <dig> , t = - <dig> , p <  <dig> . unlike the gh genes, most phytopathogenic-like effectors, including elicitin and crn genes, do not show any differential expression . transcripts corresponding to the cellulose binding elicitor lectin  proteins, which have been previously associated with the l. giganteum attachment to carbohydrate residues potentially embedded in the chitin-based host cuticle  <cit> , were the only canonical oomycete effectors  <cit>  to appear significantly up regulated in the presence of host substrate , t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . importantly, the gene expression analysis  complemented the protein secretion predictions that were based on the identification of signal peptide at the n terminal of the putative l. giganteum proteins . the genomic sequence information collected in the current and previous  <cit>  studies has indicated that the l. giganteum crn proteins appear to lack signal peptide sequences, and are not overexpressed in the presence of the host. in contrast, all genes that were demonstrated to be significantly up-regulated in the presence of mosquito larvae  were also characterized by the presence of signal peptides, suggesting that they represent promising virulence factor against mosquitoes.fig.  <dig> ratios of relative expression levels of selected l. giganteum gene transcripts in presence vs. absence of mosquito larvae . canonical oomycete effectors, characteristic of plant pathogenic oomycetes, are color coded in light grey , whereas carbohydrate active enzymes, including the phylogenetically unique l. giganteum gh5_ <dig> and gh <dig>  are represented in dark grey . relative expression levels for each gene  were normalized to the control genes β-tubulin and cellulose synthase. error bars represent standard error of the mean. * indicates p <  <dig> , ** indicates p <  <dig> 




discussion
one of the main objectives of this study consisted of determining if the l. giganteum transcriptome contains crn <dig> orthologs, and if these genes are over-expressed in the presence of  host substrates. the genomic survey revealed that crn <dig> orthologs, including sequences characterized by the canonical association of the lxlyla-dfa-ddc motifs  <cit> , are present in the l. giganteum genome, and the fact that these genes can be readily amplified from rna pools suggested that the crn <dig> proteins are expressed by l. giganteum cells. the presence of crn <dig> homologs provides evidence to support the recent description of crn transcripts in the l. giganteum transcriptome  <cit> , expanding the understanding of both the l. giganteum effector repertoire, and its phylogenetic affinities. however, the characterization of l. giganteum crn putative proteins also indicated that these effector orthologs may play little role in the mosquito pathogenicity process. first, all crn protein sequences obtained to date were characterized by the absence of signal peptides, suggesting that the corresponding proteins are not secreted during host-pathogen interactions. in addition, none of the three l. giganteum crn canonical c terminal domains  appeared up regulated in the presence of host substrate . the lack of both detectable signal peptides and up-regulation during host interactions contrast with the situation reported for the frog pathogen b. dendrobatidis. in bd, at least some of the putative crn proteins were predicted to contain signal peptides  <cit> , and showed significant increased expression in the presence of frog skin  <cit> . for l. giganteum, the evidence generated to date has remained consistently insufficient to link crn proteins to the pathogenicity process. a comprehensive analysis of the l. giganteum crn effector repertoire may require not only the complete genome sequence for this oomycete, but also an improved sampling of mosquito infection time points. as noted previously, l. giganteum causes systemic infections in host insects  <cit> . the infectious process is similar to other filamentous entomopathogens, such as the fungus beauveria bassiana, and can be divided into distinct, sequential steps that may be associated with specific molecular arsenals  <cit> . these steps include the recognition and attachment of zoospores to the host cuticle, followed by zoospore germination and penetration of a germ tube through the exoskeleton, and finally evasion of the host defense system, and mycelial growth, within the host hemolymph. the gene expression analyses presented in this study were designed to initiate comparisons with bd, and mimic the addition of a basic host substrate  by supplementing the growth media with mosquito larvae. accordingly, the putative virulence factors identified through these analyses may be expected to exhibit biological activity on the insect cuticle, and predominantly play a role in the early stage of infection . this initial profiling may need to be complemented with additional gene expression studies aimed at identifying l. giganteum proteins mediating the in vivo interactions with the host defense system during later infection stages. it is possible that the complete genome sequence of l. giganteum will reveal crn proteins amended with predicted signal peptides, and that comprehensive transcriptomics and proteomics analyses of the in vivo host-pathogen interactions will indicate that crn proteins are secreted in the insect hemolymph and contribute to the pathogenicity process. however, the global current evidence indicates that crn proteins are not involved in entomopathogenic interactions, supporting the hypothesis that these effectors may represent remnant characteristics of the l. giganteum phytopathogenic ancestor  <cit> .

although the l. giganteum secretome appears devoid of crn proteins, it includes a unique combination of carbohydrate-active molecules, containing either carbohydrate-binging module  or glycoside hydrolases  domains, that have been characterized not only by the presence of predicted signal peptides, but also by high levels of gene expression in the presence of mosquito larvae . this growing l. giganteum cazome  <cit>  represents a promising catalog of virulence factors that may exhibit significant biological activity against a. aegypti, which is known as the predominant mosquito vector for numerous current public health threats, including dengue, chikungunya and zika fevers  <cit> . in particular, the strong up-regulation of the cbel gene  supports the hypothesis that these proteins mediate the l. giganteum attachment to the mosquito host cuticle  <cit> , and suggests that the cbm <dig> domains may have important biotechnological applications for the development of novel contact bioinsecticides. the cbm <dig> domains have also been detected in the genome sequences of entomopathogenic fungi, sometimes in association with gh <dig>  motifs  <cit> . since the cbm <dig> domains are predominantly linked with binding to cellulose, they have been seldom related to the pathogenicity process in entomopathogenic fungi, and instead have been tied to the endophytic abilities displayed by many fungal entomopathogens  <cit> . however, fungal cbm <dig> domains can also bind to chitin, and improved the substrate binding and activity of chimeric chitinases  <cit> , leading to increased pathogen virulence on chitin-based host substrate  <cit> . similarly, fungal gh <dig> enzymes have been implicated in the early stages of insect infection by the filamentous entomopathogen metarhizium anisopliae  <cit> . these reports contribute to validate the gene expression assays performed in this study and provide additional evidence that the up-regulated l. giganteum cazome illustrated in fig.  <dig> includes important pathogenicity determinants. they also confirm the previously proposed hypothesis that entomopathogenic filamentous pathogens  exhibit convergent evolution  <cit> . furthermore, the fact that at least some of the l. giganteum putative pathogenicity factors, such as cbel and gh <dig>  are significantly up-regulated  in the presence of mosquito larvae serves to strengthen the observation that the crn proteins may not be involved in the infectious process.

finally, the gene expression analyses revealed that two novel, and phylogenetically unique, l. giganteum genes  are differentially expressed in the presence of host substrates . the gh5_ <dig> predicted proteins were originally described in a previous transcriptome study  <cit> . they were shown to be absent from most plant pathogenic genomes, but shared by phylogenetically diverse cuticle-degrading organisms, including insect and nematode pathogens. the robust change in gene expression demonstrated in this study confirms that the gh5_ <dig> enzymes represent promising compounds that warrant being tested for insecticidal potential . analogously, genome mining and phylogenetic analyses performed in this study  established that gh <dig> enzymes are absent in phytopathogens, but are shared by animal pathogenic oomycetes. although the change in expression appeared subtler, statistical analyses showed that the gh <dig> transcripts are included in the significantly up-regulated l. giganteum secretome . the significance of the identification of the l. giganteum gh <dig> gene is two-fold. on one hand, the detection of molecules with strong similarity to known chitinases suggests that the l. giganteum gh <dig> enzymes should be included along with the gh5_ <dig> proteins in functional studies aimed at investigating the impact of these molecules on the host cuticle. the potential of the gh <dig> enzymes as mosquitocides should also be evaluated, based on combined reports describing hexosaminidases as insecticidal toxins  <cit> , and l. giganteum extracellular metabolites as larvicidal compounds  <cit> . on the other hand, the arthropod-to-oomycete lateral gene transfer proposed for saprolegnialean gh <dig> genes not only supports the hypothesis that gh <dig> enzymes are important pathogenicity factors for l. giganteum, but also indicates that a wider sampling of animal pathogenic oomycete genomes may lead to the identification of shared pathogenicity factors active on animal hosts. this shared set of genes appears to include gh <dig> enzymes, but not crn proteins, and may be contrasted to the common core of effectors that was identified from the wealth of genomic information produced for plant pathogenic oomycetes  <cit> . studies have been initiated to confirm the presence of gh <dig> genes in other, previously unsampled, animal pathogenic oomycetes, such as the mosquito pathogen leptolegnia chapmanii, or the nematode pathogen lagenidium caudatum  <cit> . the generation of additional sequences will serve to refine the phylogenetic analyses presented in fig.  <dig>  in an effort to resolve the relationships between the various fungal, animal, and plant clades, and provide support for a host-to-pathogen lateral gene transfer event  <cit>  in the saprolegnialean ancestor.

CONCLUSIONS
the gene expression analyses presented in this study contribute to the identification of several l. giganteum genes that are up-regulated in the presence of mosquito host, and complement the gene sequence annotation initiated by a l. giganteum transcriptome survey  <cit> . the most promising virulence factor candidates correspond to proteins predicted to be active on host cuticle carbohydrates, and include gh <dig> enzymes that may represent novel pathogenicity factors shared among animal pathogenic oomycetes. functional studies aimed at demonstrating the predicted activities of gh <dig>  gh5_ <dig>  gh <dig> and cbel proteins on mosquito larvae are currently being initiated by cloning the reported full-length gene sequences in expression vectors. the purification of recombinant proteins will allow for the production of antibodies that may be used in immunoblotting reactions to confirm secretion predictions, and gene expression patterns, at a proteomics level. overall, the gene profile information presented in this study provides an additional line of evidence to validate the entomopathogen l. giganteum as a source of novel biological compounds against vector mosquitoes, and as a strong model to uncover the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity in animal pathogenic oomycetes  <cit> .
