BACKGROUND
high molecular weight glutenin subunits are important component of wheat gluten proteins which are mainly responsible for dough viscosity and elasticity in wheat processing  <cit> . the hmw-gs accounts for up to about 12% of the total protein in the endosperm of common wheat , while their allelic variation explains about 45% to 70% of the variation in bread making performance within european wheat cultivars  <cit> . thus, their coding sequences are the prime candidates for molecular modification to enhance grain-processing quality  <cit> .

the genes encoding the wheat hmw-gs are located on the long arms of the homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . each locus consists of two tightly linked genes, termed x- and y-type genes according to their different molecular weights. so far, the structural characteristics of more than ten hmw-gs alleles have been revealed by dna sequencing  <cit> . all of these hmw-gs contain a central repetitive domain flanked by non-repetitive n- and c-terminal domains. the central domain of both the x- and the y-type subunits comprises hexapeptide and nonapeptide motifs, but the x-type subunits also contain tripeptide motifs. the presence of such a large repetitive central domain probably provides the basis for major and rapid structural changes via duplication and/or deletion of large segments as a result of unequal cross over  <cit> .

the hmw-gs proteins are important for wheat processing quality; however, the number of hmw-gs alleles with good quality is very limited in wheat cultivars. so, peoples turn to wheat-related grasses for new good quality hmw-gs allele for wheat quality improvement. but many hmw-gs in wheat-related grasses are smaller than those of normal wheat  <cit> , while the length of hmw-gs has been proved to be positively correlated with dough strength. thus, the simple introgression or transformation of hmw-gs from grasses is not sufficient for the wheat quality breeding.

asymmetric somatic hybridization between protoplast of common wheat  and uv-irradiated protoplast of agropyron elongatum can generate fertile introgression lines with superior agronomic traits, in particular the bread-making quality  <cit> . about 35% of the  <dig> somatic hybrids express novel high quality hmw-gs subunits not present in jinan <dig>  or both parents  <cit> . for example, line ii- <dig> has good bread-making quality, and its hmw-gs profile is h1ax2*, h1bx13+h1by <dig>  h1dx5+h1dy <dig>  <cit> . the identification of the origination of these new subunits will benefit the understanding of the process and guide us to identify and produce more new hmw-gs genes through the somatic hybridization. we speculated the possible formation process of novel genes previously by sequencing the h1bx13+h1by <dig> and h1ay genes of introgression line ii- <dig>  <cit> . in this report, we isolated and sequenced all the hmw-gs genes of both ii- <dig> and another sib introgression line, which also has a special hmw-gs profile different from jinan <dig>  and the origination of novel hmw-gs genes in hybrid wheat was discussed.

RESULTS
sds-page profile of hmw-gs
the sds-page profile of hmw-gs showed that the parent wheat jinan <dig> has the combination of "1bx <dig> +1by <dig> ; 1dx <dig> +1dy <dig> " while another parent a. elongatum contains nine hmw-gs in seeds; the hmw-gs composition of hybrid line ii- <dig> and 11-4- <dig> appeared to be "h1ax2*; h1bx13+h1by16; h1dx5+h1dy12" and "h1ax1; h1bx7+h1by8; h1dx5+h1dy12" similar to bread wheat, respectively .

hmw-gs genes from both parents and two introgression lines
the amplified product of parent wheat jinan <dig> and two introgression lines ii- <dig> and 11-4- <dig> ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb, but two smaller fragments also appeared in the 11-4-6; the amplicon of another parent a. elongatum ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb . all the amplified products of both parents and the two hybrid lines were cloned and a lot of inserts with different sizes were obtained. after sequencing the terminal region of these inserts we ascertained the identity of these inserts. we selected some inserts to represent the coding region of subunits of parents and the two hybrids, then, we obtained their full length sequences by nested deletion. through comparison of the mobility of proteins expressed in e. coli directed by some sequences with those of subunits in seeds and alignment of these sequences with those published hmw-gs alleles  of common wheat, four sequences were designated 1dx <dig>  , 1bx <dig>  , 1by <dig>   and 1dy <dig>   to represent the orfs of 1bx <dig> +1by <dig>  and 1dx <dig> +1dy <dig>  of parent jinan <dig> respectively ; h1dx <dig> , h1dy <dig>  and h1by <dig>  were designated as the coding sequences of h1dx5+h1dy <dig> of ii- <dig> and h1by <dig> of hybrid 11-4- <dig>  the character h in these names means that these sequences come from hybrid introgression lines. we also acquired two sequences from hybrid 11-4- <dig> which were different from any of the four hmw-gs alleles cloned from parent jinan <dig> and we named them h11-3- <dig>  and h11-4- <dig> . however, both of them were very similar to aey <dig>  and aex <dig>  cloned from a. elongatum respectively. the other two smaller fragments cloned in the amplicon of 11-4- <dig> were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. after sequence alignment, we found that they came from deletion of large fragments of h1by <dig>  therefore, we inferred that they were artifacts of pcr amplification and did not select them for further analyzes. there are no corresponding subunits of h11-3- <dig> and h11-4- <dig> in hybrid 11-4- <dig>  the h11-3- <dig> contains in frame stop codon and frame shift mutation in its' orf, therefore it can not express intact proteins in the seed. the reason why proteins encoded by h11-4- <dig> absent from seeds of 11-4- <dig> is unknown, we suggest that h11-4- <dig> was silenced in hybrids via dna methylation because we have found that about 12% loci of the hybrids were hypermethylated using msap platform . the other alleles cloned from a. elongatum were not shown in this paper. amino acid sequences derived from all these sequences possessed the characteristic of hmw-gs of bread wheat, with a  <dig> amino acid residues signal peptide, n- and c-terminal conserved regions and a central repetitive region. the detailed structures of subunits derived from these sequences and some representative subunits of bread wheat were shown in table  <dig> 

novel hmw-gs genes from the introgression of donor to receptor
h11-3- <dig> and h11-4- <dig> of hybrid wheat 11-4- <dig> displayed a high similarity with aey <dig> and aex <dig> of a. elongatum, but low similarity with all hmw-gs alleles of jinan <dig> , which confirmed that these two sequences might be transferred from a. elongatum to hybrid wheat genome during somatic hybridization. gish analysis of hybrid wheat genome in our lab revealed that different hybrid lines had different sites of translocation or insertion of chromatin  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  located introgression small-chromosome-segments of a. elongatum on hybrid wheat chromosomes 2al, 1bl, 5bs, 1dl, 2dl and 6ds, using gish/fish/ssr analysis combined with karyotype data. however, there is no direct evidence concerning the hybrid introgression line contains gene from donor on the molecular level. the sequence data of these two genes provided further evidence that asymmetric somatic hybridization can transfer alien gene from donor to the receptor genome, and the potential as a genetic/genomic tool for crop improvements.

novel hmw-gs gene present in hybrid via point mutation of parent gene
sequence alignment indicated that h1dx <dig> was similar to 1dx <dig>  of parent jinan <dig> with  <dig> amino acid substitutions  and we did not found any sequences similar to h1dx <dig> from a. elongtum, so we confirmed that h1dx <dig> of hybrid came from 1dx <dig>  of parent wheat via point mutation in the process of hybridization. both h1dx <dig> and 1dx <dig>  shows more similarity to 1dx <dig>  than 1dx <dig>  of bread wheat. however, they do not share the position  <dig> amino acid deletion characteristic of subunit 1dx <dig>  bacterial expression of modified orfs of h1dx <dig> and 1dx <dig>  confirmed that they are coding sequences of h1dx <dig> and 1dx <dig>  respectively . although molecular weights of deduced amino acids of h1dx <dig> and 1dx <dig>  are similar, the migration of these two subunits on sds-page is obviously different . the reason of such anomaly is not known. however, it has been reported that the migrations of allelic subunit pair 1dx2/1dx <dig> and 1dy10/1dy <dig> was anomalous, subunit 1dx <dig> has a higher mobility than the smaller allelic 1dx <dig>  and similarly, 1dy <dig> has a lower mobility than the larger allelic 1dy <dig>  <cit> . through urea sds-page and making chimeric genes, goldsbrough et al.  <cit>  found that the anomaly of migration on sds-page between 1dy <dig> and 1dy <dig> might be resulted from conformational differences induced by six amino acid substitution between the two subunits. urea sds-page of recovered h1dx <dig> and 1dx <dig>  proteins showed that the two subunits appeared nearly the same electrophoretic mobility in presence of urea where secondary structure of these proteins is broken down and the proteins are separated according to their relative molecular weight . bread making-quality analysis showed that hybrid-derived h1dx <dig> subunit was related to good grain-processing quality, while 1dx <dig>  subunit was correlated with bad ones  <cit> . therefore, we speculated that the same conformational difference was responsible for both the observed grain-processing quality differences and the anomalous electrophoretic behavior.

hybrid novel gene from allelic variation of parents via unequal crossover or slippage
sequence alignment indicated that h1by <dig>  and h1by <dig> were very similar with 1by <dig>  except the addition of repeat motifs and few snps. h1by <dig> contains an additional block of repeat than 1by <dig>  while h1by <dig> contains another repeat than h1by <dig> . although h1by <dig> shows more similarity with aey <dig>  the latter has a single base deletion which results in a frame shift mutation, so h1by <dig> might not be acquired from a. elongatum. h1by <dig> and h1by <dig> should be formed by unequal crossover or slippage of 1by <dig>  to duplicate block of repeats. this is coincident with variation of ssr loci in hybrids. there present obvious variation in band pattern of some ssr loci between hybrid and parents using  <dig> primer pairs. sequencing of some novel bands indicates that the variation of band pattern is mainly due to the addition or deletion of one or more repeat motifs . addition or deletion of repeat motifs maybe an effective mechanism of variation happened in sequences that contain many repeat motifs in them.

shuffling of parents genes to produce novel chimeric hmw-gs genes
the coding sequence of h1dy <dig> shows very high similarity with that of 1dy <dig> , with only a few snps, both of them are  <dig> bp in length. the  <dig> bp's long y-type sequence cloned from a. elongatum  makes us a little doubt about the origin of h1dy <dig> of hybrid ii- <dig>  the three highly homologous  <dig> bp sequences  contain  <dig> different snps in all. sequence alignment reveals that  <dig> of  <dig> discrepant bases before position  <dig> are the same between 1dy <dig>  and h1dy <dig>  while  <dig> of another  <dig> discrepant bases after position  <dig> are the same between h1dy <dig> and aey <dig> . therefore we conclude that the h1dy <dig> of hybrid is likely a chimeric gene generated by recombination between 1dy <dig>  and aey <dig> . this is coincident with lmw-gs genes found in another sib hybrid wheat introgression line 7-4-1- <dig> in our lab. chen et al. cloned and sequenced lmw-gs genes from the line and both parents, and found some chimeric genes . as for the  <dig> bases that were different between h1dy <dig> and corresponding parent genes, they might be the result of single base mutation during the process of uv-irradiation to the donor in the asymmetric somatic hybridization of the parent wheat and a. elongatum  <cit>  and long-term tissue culture of parents/hybrids before or after the cell fusion, just like that happened in h1dx <dig> 

comparison of new gene generation from intergeneric hybridization with natural hmw-gs gene evolution
from evolutionary view, it was suggested that the evolutionary origin of hmw-gs involved a same ancestor  <cit> . anderson and greene  <cit>  proposed a simplest mechanism about the sequence evolution of hmw-gs genes, which include:  single base changes  deletions or additions within a repeat  single repeat changes  deletions or duplications of blocks of repeats. through cloning and sequencing of hmw-gs genes of the sib hybrid lines and both parents, we found that asymmetric somatic hybridization could not only transfer donor genes to the hybrid genome, but also lead to the emergence of new genes . the formation of some novel hybrid genes was inosculated with the mechanism mentioned by anderson and greene  <cit> . moreover, we found gene shuffling in hybrid can also produce novel hmw-gs gene, just like that happened in the origination of some novel genes in drosophila  <cit> . thus, the novel hmw-gs and combinations generated in the sib asymmetric somatic hybrid lines from a same fusion cell are similar to the natural emergence of new hmw-gs but in less time.

the novel hmw-gs with wheat quality breeding
in our investigation, many hybrid-derived novel hmw-gs show correlation with good grain-processing quality, such as h1bx13+h1by <dig>  h1dx5+h1dy <dig> and h1by <dig> subunits  in ii- <dig> and other sib lines  <cit> . we are using them in gene transformation and marker-assistant quality breeding of common wheat, and a lot of germplasms and strains with high qualities have been produced from them. therefore, asymmetric somatic hybridization between common wheat and relative intergeneric grasses can be an important tool for wheat quality breading.

CONCLUSIONS
through sequencing and comparing hmw-gs genes from introgression lines of wheat/a. elongatum and both parents, we confirmed that genes of a. elongatum had been introgressed into wheat in asymmetric somatic hybridization. it is significant that some novel hmw-gs genes with good processing quality could be generated in the introgression lines via the asymmetric somatic hybridization. the formation of these novel genes showed similarity to the evolutionary mechanism of natural hmw-gs genes proposed before, except that gene shuffling was found to be a special mode to form novel chimeric genes in the hybrid lines. the result suggests that asymmetric somatic hybridization is a unique pathway to produce novel genes that can be used for wheat quality improvement.
