BACKGROUND
alfalfa  is the most widely grown forage legume across the globe and plays key roles in livestock nutrition, protecting water and soil resources, enhancing soil fertility, and sequestering soil carbon. in addition, alfalfa has many attributes that make it attractive as a biofuel feedstock including high biomass yield potential. due to biological nitrogen fixation, alfalfa usually requires no nitrogen fertilizer, and can provide all of the nitrogen required for the following grain crop. alfalfa forage can be fractionated into protein-rich leaves and cellulose-rich stems to create two product streams. the stems can be used for production of energy by fermentation to ethanol or gasification to produce electricity. developing varieties with increased cellulose would enhance the value of alfalfa as a cellulosic biomass feedstock  <cit> . all tissues in elongating stem internodes  deposit thin, cellulose-poor primary cell walls  <cit> . in contrast, thick, cellulose-rich secondary walls are deposited in phloem and xylem fiber cells in post-elongation stem internodes. one strategy for increasing cellulose is to increase the expression of enzymes involved in cellulose synthesis in vascular cells in alfalfa stems.

sucrose synthase , a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the reversible conversion of sucrose into fructose and udp-glucose, has been thought to play a major role in providing udp-glucose for cellulose synthesis . sus is encoded by a small gene family in most plant species . in m. truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa, five sus genes were identified  <cit>  and six isoforms were identified in the model legume lotus japonicus  <cit> . in alfalfa, less is known about the sus gene family. currently, only one sus gene sequence, for the mssus <dig> isoform, is present in genbank . in several plants, an increase in sus expression was correlated with an increase in cellulose  <cit> . the over-expression of an sus gene from cotton  in hybrid poplar under the control of either the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter or a xylem-specific promoter increased sus enzyme activity and cellulose in secondary xylem  <cit> .

sucrose is also hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose by invertase enzymes. invertases are classified into two major groups, the acid invertases, located primarily in the cell wall and vacuole, and the alkaline/neutral  invertases located in the cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids  <cit> . invertases were thought to have a minor role in sucrose metabolism, but recent studies have shown them to potentially have a broader role in sucrose catabolism. mutated arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking four of the six isoforms of sus  and reported to lack soluble and membrane bound sus activity, nonetheless exhibited normal growth and cellulose content. however, mutation of two neutral cytosolic invertase isoforms  resulted in severe inhibition of growth  <cit> . similarly, mutation of the predominant isoform of cytosolic invertase in l. japonicus, ljinv <dig>  resulted in a severe reduction in growth of roots and shoots, a change in cellular development, and impaired flowering  <cit> . however, mutation of the predominant sus isoforms, ljsus <dig> and ljsus <dig>  had little effect on plant growth, reproduction, or nitrogen fixation. only when the sus1-1/sus3- <dig> double mutant was grown in the absence of nitrogen was leaf number and shoot weight reduced compared to wild-type plants  <cit> .

previous work showed that an alfalfa phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene  was expressed at high levels in alfalfa root nodules  <cit> . the full-length promoter  fused to the β-glucuronidase  gene resulted in gus expression in the root nodule, root tip, and pulvinus. a shorter promoter segment designated p <dig>  directed very strong gus activity in vascular tissue throughout the plant. in stems, gus activity was localized primarily to xylem cells  <cit> .

we utilized the p <dig> promoter of pepc- <dig>  to express the mssus <dig> cdna in transgenic alfalfa to test the hypothesis that vascular-enhanced expression would increase stem cell wall cellulose. the results showed that in contrast to expectations, expressing mssus <dig> using the pepc7-p <dig> promoter resulted in strong down-regulation of mssus <dig> transcripts, and eliminated most of the sus enzyme activity in vascular tissue of alfalfa stems. down-regulation of sus had only minor effects on plant growth and cell wall sugar composition of stems. although sus activity was very low in transformants with the pepc7-p4:: mssus <dig> construct, acid invertase activity was maintained and a/n invertase activity increased. we discuss the implications of the relationship between sus and invertase, the sus isoforms, and their potential roles in cell wall biosynthesis.

RESULTS
histochemical analysis of the pepc7-p4::gus reporter
previous work demonstrated that the pepc7-p <dig> promoter was active in the vascular tissue of alfalfa nodules, roots, and stems  <cit> . we examined the gus staining pattern in nodules, roots, and stems of pepc7-p4::gus transformants with a more detailed analysis of stem tissues. our results confirm expression of gus in vascular tissues of roots and nodules containing the pepc7-p4::gus construct . in stems, we found that the pepc7-p <dig> promoter was active in both xylem and phloem tissue. gus staining in phloem was evident in both elongating stem  and post-elongation stem  internodes . gus staining in xylem was more evident in es relative to pes internodes and was primarily localized to the protoxylem and the xylem parenchyma. in apical regions of es internodes , gus staining occurred only in xylem suggesting that the pepc7-p <dig> promoter was not active in the protophloem. the transformants selected to be used as transgenic control lines  contained the pepc7-p4::gus construct but lacked gus expression as tested by histochemical staining.fig.  <dig> histochemical gus staining of alfalfa stem tissue expressing the pepc7-p4::gus construct. a, root; , nodule; , transverse section of elongating stem  internode; , transverse section of post-elongation stem  internode. scale bar represents 1 mm



relative expression of mssus <dig> in transgenic plants
primers specific to the mssus <dig> transcript were used in quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr  assays to measure mssus <dig> transcript accumulation in stems. a survey of es internodes from  <dig> independent pepc7-p4::sus <dig> transformed lines showed that the mssus <dig> transcript was reduced  <dig> to 90 % compared to the mean transcript level in es internodes of the control lines . two transformed lines  that exhibited approximately 90 % down-regulation of the mssus <dig> transcript in both es and pes internodes compared to the controls  were selected for further study.fig.  <dig> quantitative reverse transcriptase-pcr of mssus <dig> transcripts in elongating stem  and post-elongation stem  internodes.expression values in mssus <dig> transformants  were calculated relative to sus transcripts in controls. control values represent the average of two plant lines . values for m <dig> and m <dig> represent means ± standard error 



sus enzyme and in situ enzyme activity
in stems of the control  alfalfa line, sus enzyme activity was found to be  <dig> -fold higher in pes compared to es internodes . in the pepc7-p4::sus <dig> transformed lines  sus activity in es internodes was below the level of detection  and sus activity was reduced by more than 95 % in pes internodes compared to the control line m <dig> . sus activity was detected by in situ enzyme assays in the phloem and xylem tissue in the control line with greater activity in the pes internodes than es internodes . the in situ enzyme assays showed that sus activity was greatly reduced in es internodes of the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> transformant  and was below the level of detection in pes internodes .fig.  <dig> sucrose synthase activity in stem internodes. activity was measured in internodes of control  and the lines containing the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> construct . a elongating stem  internodes. b post-elongating stem  internodes. values represent means ± standard error . asterisk indicates sus activity was at the limits of detection

sus immunoblotting and mass spectrometry of sus polypeptides
immunoblotting was conducted to examine sus protein in the soluble fraction  of stem extracts from the controls  and the mssus <dig> down-regulated transformants . sus antiserum produced against maize sucrose synthase  <dig>  <cit>  was used to probe the immunoblot. the results showed that three immunoreactive polypeptides were detected in es internodes in the control lines, one major polypeptide of approximately 90 kda and two minor polypeptides of slightly higher molecular weight . in the es internodes of the sus down-regulated transformed lines the major 90 kda sus polypeptide band was absent, although the two minor bands of higher molecular weight remained. in contrast, the pes internodes of control lines showed the presence of only one major sus polypeptide band at approximately 90 kda. the pes internodes of the sus down-regulated lines showed no immunoreactive polypeptides.fig.  <dig> immunoblot of sucrose synthase proteins in elongating stem  and post-elongating stem  internodes of control lines  and the lines containing the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> construct . each lane contains 40 μg of soluble protein from es or pes internodes. numbers at the side of the blot indicate the molecular mass of the protein markers in kda



sus protein can occur as cytosolic or membrane-associated . the soluble fraction  used in the immunoblot of pes internodes  contained both the cytosolic and microsomal membrane fractions. to determine whether the sus protein in pes internodes was cytosolic or membrane-associated, we centrifuged the soluble fraction at  <dig>  x g to remove microsomal membranes and repeated the immunoblot. the results indicated that the sus isoform in pes internodes was a soluble cytosolic protein and not a membrane-associated protein . the immunoreactive band from the gel was eluted, trypsin digested, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. a total of  <dig> unique peptides were analyzed that corresponded to  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acids in sus <dig> . based on available sequences in genbank and rna-seq data , the protein in the 90 kda band was identified as mssus <dig> fig.  <dig> immunoblot of sucrose synthase proteins in the cytosolic  and membrane  fractions of post-elongation stem  internodes and nodules of control plants. each lane contains  <dig>  μg soluble protein. the protein in the membrane fraction was solubilized with 1 % triton-x  <dig>  numbers at the side of the blot indicate the molecular mass of the protein markers in kda



one major and one minor immunoreactive sus polypeptide were identified in an alfalfa root nodule extract from control plants . both sus polypeptides in nodules were in the cytosolic fraction and no sus protein was detected in the membrane-associated fraction. the immunoblot showed that the major sus polypeptide in nodules co-migrates with the cytosolic mssus <dig> from stems. mass spectrometry analysis of the major sus polypeptide from nodules was also identified as mssus <dig>  these results are consistent with the report that the sus <dig> orthologs in m. truncatula  <cit>  and l. japonicus  <cit>  are expressed in both nodules and stems.

effect of mssus <dig> down-regulation on other sus transcripts
we identified four sus isoforms from alfalfa, mssus <dig>  mssus <dig>  mssus <dig>  and mssus <dig> , using alfalfa rna-seq data . the alfalfa genes identified are orthologs of the mtsus <dig>  mtsus <dig>  mtsus <dig>  and mtsus <dig> genes  <cit>  previously identified in m. truncatula . using the sequence data for the four alfalfa sus isoforms, we designed primers for mssus <dig>  mssus <dig>  mssus <dig>  and mssus <dig>  and measured transcript abundance of these four sus isoforms in plants containing the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> construct  relative to the transgenic control line m <dig>  in both es and pes internodes, mssus <dig> transcripts had very low relative expression in the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> transformed lines  suggesting that the transgene also caused down-regulation of mssus <dig>  however, down-regulation was not observed for mssus <dig> and mssus <dig> transcripts in the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> transformed lines . expression of mssus <dig> and mssus <dig> in transformed lines is consistent with the presence of minor bands in the immunoblot of es extracts  and low levels of in situ sus activity in es in ternodes of pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> transformed lines .fig.  <dig> quantitative reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis of transcripts for mssus <dig>  mssus <dig>  mssus <dig>  and mssus <dig> isoforms. a elongating stem  and  post-elongation stem  internodes of a control line  and lines containing the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> construct . values represent means ± standard error 



sus down-regulation does not yield a mutant phenotype
although sus enzyme activity was largely absent in stem internodes of m <dig> and m <dig> , these plants did not exhibit an obvious shoot phenotype compared to the control . we compared shoot and root biomass accumulation of the control  and the mssus <dig> down-regulated lines . the results show a small  significant  reduction in shoot and total biomass of the m <dig> line compared to the control . however, no significant differences were observed between the m <dig> and m <dig> lines. we also examined the effects of mssus <dig> down-regulation on stem cell wall sugar composition . the results showed that the amount of cellulose  did not differ between the mssus <dig> down-regulated lines  and the control . small statistically significant  changes in total cell wall and galactose content occurred in m <dig> but not m <dig> . it is possible that changes in cell wall content were localized to the vascular tissues and therefore significant differences could not be detected in the whole stem analysis.table  <dig> dry weight  of shoots and roots of the control  and the mssus <dig> down-regulated lines

effect of mssus <dig> down-regulation on invertase and in situ enzyme assays of neutral invertase
we examined the possibility that the lack of a pronounced mutant phenotype in plants exhibiting significant mssus <dig> down-regulation in stems was the result of invertase activity. therefore, we measured acid, alkaline, and neutral invertase activity in es and pes internodes of the control and down-regulated lines. for acid invertase we evaluated the activity of vacuolar  and cell wall  forms in es and pes internodes. the results showed that vacuolar acid invertase activity was very high in es relative to pes internodes  in both the control  and mssus <dig> down-regulated lines . this result was expected because vacuolar acid invertase plays a role in osmoregulation and is highly expressed in regions of cell division and elongation  <cit> , which occur in es internodes. vacuolar acid invertase was slightly reduced in es internodes of m <dig> compared to the control m <dig> but was not significantly different in es internodes of m <dig> compared to the control . there were no significant differences in vacuolar acid invertase activity between control and down-regulated lines in pes internodes. insoluble acid invertase activity showed no significant differences between the es and pes samples and was expressed at a relatively low level as compared to the vacuolar acid invertase . mssus <dig> down-regulated lines showed no significant difference in insoluble acid invertase activity compared to the control. overall, the results indicated that sus <dig> down-regulation had little or no effect on acid invertase activity in either es or pes internodes.fig.  <dig> acid invertase activity in elongating stem  and post-elongation stem  internodes. a vacuolar and  cell wall activity of m <dig>  and the mssus <dig> down-regulated lines . values are means ± standard error . ** indicates a significant difference  as determined by analysis of variance compared to the control m22



in contrast to acid invertase activity, mssus <dig> down-regulation resulted in significant  increases in neutral invertase activity. neutral invertase activity increased  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold in es internodes of m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively compared to m <dig> . similarly, in pes internodes neutral invertase increased  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively compared to m <dig>  in contrast, there was no significant difference in alkaline invertase activity in es internodes between control and mssus <dig> down-regulated lines . alkaline invertase activity in pes internodes of m <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher than the control m <dig> but activity in m <dig> was similar to the control. an in situ enzyme assay of es and pes stem transverse sections was done to localize neutral invertase activity in control and mssus <dig> down-regulated lines. the results showed that neutral invertase activity was localized to the same vascular tissues  as sus . additionally, neutral invertase activity was maintained in vascular tissue of the m <dig> down-regulated transformant where sus activity was greatly reduced .fig.  <dig> comparison of invertase activity in elongating stem  and post-elongation stem  internodes. a neutral and  alkaline invertase activity of the control  and mssus <dig> down-regulated lines . values represent the mean ± standard error . ** indicates a significant difference  as determined by analysis of variance compared to the control m22

discussion
this study investigated the effects of down-regulation of mssus <dig> in es and pes internodes of alfalfa. our original objective, to over-express mssus <dig> in alfalfa stem vascular tissue in order to increase cellulose in stem vascular tissues, resulted instead in down-regulation of mssus <dig> transcripts  and sus enzyme activity . the down-regulation of sus in alfalfa stem tissue resulted in no obvious phenotype and no significant changes in cell wall sugar composition. however, a/n invertase activity was found to increase in stems of the sus down-regulated lines and acid invertase levels remained high. previous studies in a. thaliana and l. japonicus found that loss of sus activity causes little to no change in plant phenotype whereas loss of invertase activity results in severe growth retardation  <cit> . our results suggest that mssus <dig> and mssus <dig> are not necessary for normal vegetative growth in alfalfa and support a major role for invertase in sucrose catabolism. however, we cannot rule out that a/n invertase and possibly acid invertase in vascular tissue can compensate for reduced sus activity.

down-regulation of sus <dig> transcripts in stems of plants containing the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> construct may be due to transgene silencing . transgene silencing occurs when over-expression of a transgene results in down-regulation of both the transgene and endogenous homologous gene . our results show that mssus <dig> is highly expressed in vascular tissue of alfalfa stems. the pepc7-p <dig> promoter used for expression of coding sequences was shown to result in high levels of expression of gus in vascular tissue . in the transformed alfalfa plants generated in this study, expression of mssus <dig> in stem vascular tissues, where it was already highly expressed, likely resulted in silencing. results from qrt-pcr assays indicate that expression of pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> may also have silenced mssus <dig> . a previous study, in which over-expression of sus increased cellulose in hybrid poplar, utilized a heterologous sus gene from cotton and heterologous promoters  <cit> . the mechanism of co-suppression is not completely understood but is thought to occur when transcripts exceed a specific threshold  <cit> . apparently, transgene expression of mssus <dig> in vascular tissue exceeded the threshold required to trigger co-suppression. we also found mssus <dig> expression to be down-regulated in roots and nodules of plants containing the pepc7-p4::mssus <dig> construct  indicating that co-suppression occurred throughout the plants.

previous research in a. thaliana, m. truncatula, and l. japonicus identified multiple isoforms of sus that are expressed with some organ specificity  <cit> . in m. truncatula, mtsus <dig> is the predominantly expressed isoform in all organs assayed and expression is enhanced in vascular cells of the stem, root, and nodule  <cit> . the isoform mtsus <dig> is also highly expressed in stems of m. truncatula. to clarify the roles of the six sus isoforms in a. thaliana, single and double knockout mutants were constructed. elimination of specific isoforms did not result in an obvious phenotype. however, a sus1/sus <dig> mutant had reduced weight gain under hypoxic soil conditions  <cit> . additional studies with a quadruple mutant  found no change in starch and sugar content in leaves or roots, seed weight or lipid content, cellulose content, or cell wall structure compared to the wild type  <cit> . in contrast, the a. thaliana double mutant of cytoplasmic neutral invertase  had reduced root and shoot growth as well as abnormally large cells in the root expansion zone, and abnormal cell division in the stele, endoderm, and cortex indicating a critical role of invertases for normal growth  <cit> . studies in l. japonicus found that the predominant invertase isoform, ljinv <dig>  is crucial to whole plant development but is not essential for nodule formation or function  <cit> . sucrolytic activity is required in vascular tissue for energy metabolism, synthesis of structural carbon for callose and cell wall cellulose synthesis, and to maintain turgor for the proper functioning of the transport stream in the phloem  <cit> . our results indicate that invertases can supply the sucrolytic activity needed in vascular tissue. however, we cannot rule out compensation of sucrolytic activity by additional sus isoforms. the four alfalfa sus isoforms that we identified could be placed into two groups depending on their pattern of expression relative to the control . mssus <dig> and mssus <dig> had very low transcript accumulation in the down-regulated lines relative to the control. in contrast, mssus <dig> and mssus <dig> transcript levels were similar to or slightly higher in the mssus <dig> down-regulated lines relative to the control. minor bands identified in the immunoblot of stem internode extracts  may correspond to these isoforms. the minor bands are likely not mssus <dig> because those bands are lacking in the down-regulated plants. we sequenced similar minor bands from gels separating proteins extracted from roots of the same transgenic lines and identified mssus <dig> and mssus <dig> .

previous reports on the essential function of invertase in nonphotosynthetic organs  <cit>  highlights the need for additional research on the regulation and function of invertases in higher plants including their role in signaling pathways regulating carbon exchange and starch accumulation. the presence of a/n invertase in multiple cellular locations  suggests a role in coordinating metabolic processes within and between organelles. cytoplasmic invertases have been postulated to play a key role in maintaining sugar homeostasis in cells where sus activity is low by controlling cytosolic concentrations of sucrose, glucose and fructose  <cit> . our study showed that acid invertase activity was high and a/n invertases were elevated in both es and pes internodes in the mssus <dig> down-regulated plant lines relative to the controls . in pes internodes, in which secondary cell wall synthesis was occurring, a/n invertase activity was  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold higher in mssus <dig> down-regulated lines than in pes internodes of the control. this suggests that invertase was supplying the glucose required for cellulose synthesis. invertase may also be supplying the sucrolytic activity needed for maintenance of sucrose translocation in phloem. in stems there is a constant leak of sucrose from transport phloem because of the large concentration gradient between phloem and the apoplast  <cit> . it is critical that the leaked sucrose be retrieved to maintain the turgor pressure that drives the flow of sucrose from source to sink. the sucrose retrieval mechanism involves uptake via a sucrose/proton symporter that utilizes the proton motive force generated by the plasma membrane h+-atpase  <cit> . sucrose cleavage provides the carbon needed to generate atp to fuel the plasma membrane h+-atpase. if the sucrose retrieval function in phloem depended on sucrose cleavage by sus, significant reductions in sucrose translocation would be expected in the mssus <dig> down-regulated lines resulting in growth inhibition. because sus down-regulation in vascular tissue caused only a small reduction in plant biomass accumulation, it appears that invertases activity in the phloem is able to provide the energy needed for sucrose retrieval, but there may be an energetic penalty. sucrose cleavage by invertase is less energy efficient than cleavage by sus. it is also possible that alfalfa stems experience hypoxia  due to limited oxygen diffusion and high rates of metabolism. hypoxia causes a switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration, which is less efficient for atp production. in hypoxic conditions, sucrose cleavage by sus would be energetically advantageous over hydrolysis by invertase. in mssus <dig> down-regulated plants the energy penalty of sucrose cleavage by invertase might be expected to result in a slower growth rate and/or lower biomass accumulation. the small significant reduction in shoot biomass accumulation observed in down-regulated plants compared to the control suggests that alfalfa stems may experience hypoxia and the invertase activity in mssus <dig> down-regulated plants has an energetic penalty.

sus has been reported to have additional important roles in plant growth and development. in legumes, root nodules contain high levels of sus  <cit>  and it has been suggested that pericycle cells in the nodule vascular system play a key role in sucrose transport into the nitrogen-fixing region and the loading of nitrogenous compounds produced by nitrogen fixation into the xylem  <cit> . additionally, most research indicates that sus activity is enhanced while a/n invertase activity is reduced in roots exposed to anoxia or hypoxia  <cit> . the sus down-regulated alfalfa lines can be useful tools for future investigations into the relative roles of sus and invertase in sucrose transport and osmotic stress tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
we examined if expression of mssus <dig> in vascular tissue would increase cellulose content of alfalfa cell walls. in contrast to expectations, alfalfa plants transformed with an alfalfa mssus <dig> cdna using an alfalfa promoter for vascular-specific expression resulted in down-regulation of transcripts, protein, and sus enzyme activity in stem internodes. down-regulation was most likely due to transgene silencing . however, down-regulation of sus activity had only minor effects on plant dry weight or cell wall content of stems. a/n invertase activity increased in vascular cells of mssus <dig> down-regulated plants and invertase appeared to provide the sucrolytic activity required for cell wall synthesis and for maintenance of sucrose translocation in phloem.
