BACKGROUND
dendritic cells constitute a heterogeneous population of antigen presenting cells that are critical for bridging the innate and the adaptive immune responses  <cit> . in the blood, dc can be sub-divided into two major populations, cd11c+ and cd11c-. the cd11c+ population is thought to be myeloid derived, therefore called myeloid or conventional dc . the cd11c- population, also known as plasmacytoid dendritic cells  appears to be lymphoid-derived and constitutes a population of cells that can migrate from the blood directly to lymphoid tissues  <cit> . pdc comprise approximately  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the blood mononuclear cells and are the primary type  <dig> interferon , producing cells, secreting high levels of these cytokines in response to viral infections  <cit>  and stimulation with tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists  <cit> . type i ifns are clinically important cytokines and are used for anti-viral  <cit>  and anti-cancer therapy  <cit> . in addition to their direct anti-viral and anti-proliferative affects, type i interferons are important in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. type  <dig> interferons have been shown to increase the expression of mhc class i and ii, enhance co-stimulatory marker expression on dc, modulate immunoglobulin production, synergize with il- <dig> to enhance ifn-γ production, and augmente nk and ctl responses  <cit> .

pdc express a limited repertoire of toll like receptors , expressing predominantly tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit>  and can be stimulated to produce large amounts of type  <dig> ifn in response to the natural tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists guanosine- and uridine-rich ssrna and dna containing cpg motifs respectively  <cit> . synthetic imidazoquinoline-like molecules exemplified by imiquimod  and resiquimod  have been identified as tlr <dig> agonists based on their inability to induce the cytokines tnfα, il- <dig>  or ifnα in tlr7-deficient mice  <cit> . in hek <dig> cells transfected with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  imiquimod and 3m-852a have been shown to posses a much higher potency at activating nfκb through tlr <dig> compared to tlr <dig>  thus showing selectivity for tlr <dig>  <cit> . resiquimod on the other hand activated nfκb through tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> at comparable levels  <cit>  as did 3m- <dig>  <cit> . the tlr <dig> agonists imiquimod, and 3m-852a were found to activate pdc for the production of ifnα while the tlr <dig> agonist 3m- <dig> activated cdc for the production of il <dig>  and the tlr7/ <dig> agonist resiquimod activated both cdc and pdc for cytokine production  <cit> . thus, the tlr <dig> agonist 3m-852a is an ideal tool to study the molecular processes impacted through tlr <dig> in pdc.

the tlr <dig> agonist imiquimod is used for the treatment of various virally induced diseases such as genital warts  <cit>  and for the treatment of cancerous and pre-cancerous skin lesions such as basal cell carcinoma   <cit>  and actinic keratosis   <cit> . the anti-viral and anti-tumor activity of synthetic tlr <dig> agonists has been attributed to the induction of cytokines such as ifnα  <cit> . gene expression analysis of skin biopsies of patients with ak and bcc after topical treatment with imiquimod has shown that the tlr <dig> agonist induces the expression of a large number of interferon inducible genes indicating the importance of type  <dig> interferons in the mechanism of resolution of pre cancerous and cancerous skin lesions  <cit> . the tlr <dig> agonist 3m-852a is currently in phase ii clinical trials for the therapy of cancer.

to date, the molecular pathways and processes of tlr7-mediated activation of pdc, the primary target of tlr <dig> agonists have not been thoroughly characterized. therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the molecular and cellular pathways and processes impacted by stimulation of pdc with tlr <dig> agonists using global gene expression analysis in highly pure preparations of pdc. to this end, we evaluated global gene expression changes after stimulation of human pdc of greater than 99% purity with the tlr <dig> agonist 3m-852a, and the tlr7/ <dig> agonist 3m- <dig> using affymetrix u133a genechips. further analysis of the data in the context of gene ontology classification and gene regulatory network analysis enabled us to identify molecular and cellular pathways impacted by stimulation of pdc through tlr <dig> 

RESULTS
characterization of pdc purity
even though pdc are reported to express high levels of tlr <dig>  other cells in pbmcs, such as monocytes also express tlr <dig>  <cit>  and can contribute to tlr7-mediated events. therefore, in order to determine tlr7-mediated gene expression specific to pdc, high purity pdc preparations are necessary. positive cell selection using bdca <dig> antibody resulted in pdc enriched preparations with variable purity ranging from 40% to 80%. further purification using flow cytometry after staining cells with apc-labeled anti-cd <dig> antibody and fitc-labeled bdca <dig> antibody resulted in pdc preparations that were greater than 99% pure. figure 1a and 1b show representative histograms from flow cytometer analysis of pdc-enriched  preparation  and a 99% pure pdc preparation  after flow purification, as evaluated by the percentage of cd123+, bdca2+, cd11c- cells.

purity of pdc preparations were also followed by monitoring the expression of various tlrs using real time rtpcr. figure 2a and 2b show the expression of various tlrs in preparations of varying pdc purity. figure 2a shows that as the purity of the pdc preparation increased, the expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> decreased. conversely, the expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> increased up to a purity of 82% then decreased somewhat , potentially indicating loss of a cell type which may be enriched in expression of these tlrs. alternatively the variability in the expression of these tlrs for preparation > 82% pdc purity may be explained by donor-to-donor variability in expression. the expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> remained somewhat constant.

induction of type  <dig> interferons genes: confirmation by real time rtpcr
go molecular function analysis of affymetrix genechip data showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> genes classified as hematopoeitin/interferon-class  cytokines, and  <dig> type- <dig> ifn genes were increased in expression by the tlr <dig> agonists. in addition, these genes were the highest induced genes in the data set with a median log <dig> fold change in expression  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the interferon genes shown to be consistently induced in all donors were ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifnb <dig>  and ifnw <dig>  ifna <dig> and ifna <dig> expression was donor variable, ifna <dig> expression was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> donors for 3m-852a and  <dig> of  <dig> donors for 3m- <dig>  ifna <dig> expression was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> donors for 3m-852a and,  <dig> of  <dig> donors for 3m- <dig> 

in order to confirm the induction of the interferon genes, we performed real time rtpcr. analysis of the time dependence of induction of type  <dig> interferons by 3m-852a from  <dig> donor using real time rtpcr  showed that induction of ifnb, ifna <dig>  ifna <dig> and ifna <dig> was high  at  <dig> minutes post stimulation and reached peak levels at  <dig>  hr , and remained at high levels  <dig> hr post stimulation. induction of ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  ifna <dig>  and ifna <dig> were relatively low   <dig> minutes post stimulation and peak levels were achieved  <dig> hrs post stimulation. table  <dig> shows a comparison of expression data obtained by affymetrix analysis and real time rtpcr analysis at  <dig> hr post stimulation for the interferon genes as well as for other selected genes. specific primers and probes for rtpcr were not available for four of the interferon alpha subtypes  at the time of data collection. the reagents for ifna <dig> in the rtpcr study detected both ifna <dig> and ifna <dig>  of the interferon genes tested by both affymetrix and real time rtpcr, all ifna subtypes and ifnb showed increased expression by both methods indicating good concordance.

1taqman primers and probes for ifna <dig> in the real time rtpcr detect both fina <dig> and ifna <dig>  fold change in expression were calculated with respect to un-stimulated pdc. for the affymetrix data, values are averages of data sets for four donors for 3m-852a and two donors for 3m- <dig>  for the real time rtpcr data, values are averages of two data sets from two donors for each compound. na designates not analyzed.

in humans, the type  <dig> interferon family of genes consists of  <dig> ifna subtypes, ifnb, ifnw, ifne <dig> also know as ifn-tau <dig>  and ifnk  <cit> . pdc are known to produce high levels of type  <dig> interferons in response to viruses  <cit>  and various toll like-receptor ligands including tlr <dig> <cit>  and tlr <dig>  <cit> . we show that stimulation of pdc through tlr <dig> results in the induction of ifnb and the majority  ifna subtypes induced by viruses such as herpes simplex virus type  <dig> and sendai virus   <cit>  and h3n <dig> flu virus  <cit> . since the anti-viral and anti-tumor activities of the different ifna subtypes have been shown to differ  <cit>  induction of a variety of ifna subtypes by tlr <dig> agonists may be an advantage for anti-viral and anti-tumor therapy.

tlr7-mediated cytokine protein expression
in order to confirm the expression of some of the genes at the protein level, elisa and luminex multiplex protein assays were used to determine the expression of several secreted cytokines and chemokines. supernatants were collected after stimulation of pdc for  <dig> hr. of the  <dig> cytokines and chemokines tested, ifnα, tnfα, il <dig>  il <dig>  mip-1α , and mip-1β  proteins were induced at high levels >  <dig> pg/ml. this is consistent with the high level of expression of these genes observed by affymetrix and real time rtpcr analysis . figure 3a shows the induction of these cytokines for 3m-852a and 3m- <dig>  in contrast, low levels of il-1β, il12p <dig>  gm-csf, rantes , mcp- <dig> , and ip <dig>  proteins were detected . the genes for il1β, il <dig>  gm-csf, and mcp <dig>  were not increased in expression in the affymetrix or real time rtpcr data. in contrast, high levels of gene expression  were observed for cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig>  the seeming disparity may be due to the fact that data was collected at  <dig> hr post stimulation and the proteins for these genes may not have reached peak expression. consistent with the gene expression data, the proteins il-1ra, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il <dig>  ifnγ, mig , and eotaxin  were not induced by tlr <dig> agonists in pdc  <dig> hr post stimulation. however, induction of these genes and proteins at a different time than  <dig> hr post stimulation can not be ruled out.

go classification of affymetrix genechip data
in order to determine tlr7-mediated global gene expression changes, affymetrix genechip analysis was performed after stimulation of pdc with tlr <dig> selective agonists 3m-852a, and the tlr7/ <dig> agonist 3m- <dig>  stimulation of pdc for  <dig> hours resulted in changes in expression of  <dig> genes with consistent expression changes across replicates for at least one of the compounds tested . out of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were increased in expression and  <dig> genes were decreased in expression due to stimulation with at least one tlr agonist in all donors tested. figure  <dig> shows a two way hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> genes altered in expression. samples clustered primarily according to donor rather than compound indicating that the compounds exhibit an overall similar gene expression profile, consistent with gene expression changes regulated through activation of tlr <dig>  subtle differences are apparent in the response of the same donor to the different agonists, primarily in the magnitude of change in expression.

in order to explore the biological significance of tlr7-mediated gene expression changes, we analyzed their gene ontology  classification using metacore as well as the go browser in spotfire for functional genomics. the most highly represented processes include: programmed cell death, specifically negative regulation of programmed cell death and anti-apoptosis, immune response, response to virus, inflammatory response and defense response. analysis for go function classification showed that the most highly represented go function is cytokine activity, including hematopoeitin/interferon class  containing proteins and chemokines . other functional groups enriched in the data set include genes with oxidoreductase activity, protein ubiquitin ligase activity and guanine nucleotide binding activity. the role of some of these processes in pdc activation will be discussed below.

analysis of gene regulatory networks
in order to further understand the molecular processes initiated following stimulation of pdc with 3m-852a and 3m- <dig> the expression data were input into metacore and analyzed for protein regulatory networks enriched with the expression data. the  <dig> genes altered in expression were used as a list of input nodes and subjected to the analyze networks  algorithm and the analyze networks  algorithm . these algorithms generate a virtual shortest paths network between all nodes from the input list and parse them into sub-networks centered on receptors and transcription factors respectively. analysis of the data using the receptor networks algorithm resulted in  <dig> sub networks focused on various receptors leading to activation of various transcription factors. the top ten significant networks were composed of  <dig> to  <dig> genes altered in expression with p value ranging from 6e- <dig> to 4e- <dig>  these top ten networks included transcription regulation initiated through activation of the chemokine receptor ccr <dig>  insulin receptor, igf- <dig> receptor, ifnα/β receptor, and cd80-cd86/ctla <dig> system.

analysis of the gene expression data in metacore using the transcription regulation algorithm resulted in  <dig> sub networks centered on various transcription factors. the top  <dig> networks consisted of transcription factors which directly regulated the expression of  <dig> to  <dig> genes, with a total network size of  <dig> to  <dig> genes and p value for significance of network ranging from 8e- <dig> to 8e- <dig>  the top ten networks were for the transcription factors p <dig>  creb <dig>  irf <dig>  rela , hnf <dig>  irf <dig>  c-rel, irf <dig>  nfkb <dig>  and nfkb p50/p <dig>  these networks were enriched in genes with go ontology classification of regulation of physiological processes and regulation of apoptosis  and anti-bacterial/antiviral humoral responses . two other networks centered on irf <dig>  and irf <dig>  and were enriched in genes with go ontology classification of defense response and virus response. some of the interaction networks derived from the above analysis will be discussed in the following sections.

transcription regulatory network indicates utilization of various transcription factors following activation of tlr7
recent research has implicated the involvement of various transcription factors including nfkb, ap <dig>  irf <dig>  and irf <dig> in signaling through tlr <dig>  <cit>  in various immune cells as well as cells transfected with tlr <dig>  <cit> . even though the direct activation of irf <dig> through tlr <dig> has been demonstrated in pdc, the direct activation of other transcription factors has not been documented. figure  <dig> shows a transcription network which illustrates interactions between the tlr <dig> signaling pathway components and transcription factors known to be activated by the tlr <dig> pathway in other cell types including irf <dig>  nfkb, irf <dig>  and c-jun. the network includes protein-protein binding interactions, protein phosphorylation and transcription regulation. some of the tlr <dig> signaling components have been omitted for the sake of clarity. the figure shows genes that are know to be transcriptionally regulated by irf <dig>  nfkb, irf <dig>  irf <dig>  c-jun and through isgf <dig> via activation of the ifnα/β receptor. exemplified are transcriptional regulation through nfkb, e.g. ccr <dig>  gro- <dig> , gro-gamma  and cd44; through irf7: e.g. type  <dig> interferons and tap2; through nfkb and irf <dig>  e.g. il <dig> and mip-1β ; through nfkb and c-jun, e.g. tnfa, mip-β, gro-β ; through irf <dig>  h <dig> and hgk ; through nfkb, irf <dig> and isgf <dig>  e.g. ccl5; isg <dig> and bcl <dig> 

interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  irf <dig>  is a transcription factor recently identified as being important for the development of type i interferon-producing cells  in the mouse  <cit> . irf8-/- mice have also been shown to be unresponsive to cpg in induction of cytokines, thus indicating the importance of irf <dig> in tlr <dig> signaling  <cit> . in addition, interactions between irf <dig> and traf <dig> resulting in enhanced ubiquitination of traf <dig> has been reported in macrophages  <cit> . whereas the role of irf <dig> in the signaling oftlr <dig> has been established, the role of irf <dig> in signaling of tlr <dig> has not been elucidated. upon stimulation of pdc with 3m-852a the expression of irf <dig> decreased by  <dig> to  <dig> fold. the significance of the decrease is not clear but may be related to feed-back regulation.

interaction of the type  <dig> interferons with the interferon receptor results in activation of the jak-stat pathway culminating in the translocation of transcriptional complex isgf <dig> composed of stat <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig>  or stat <dig> dimers  to the nucleus  <cit> . the complexes bind to specific dna sequences called ifn-α stimulated response elements  found in the promoter regions of target genes resulting in increased expression of several hundred genes. all three components of the isgf <dig> complex, irf <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig> were increased in expression upon stimulation of pdc with tlr <dig> agonists.

a large number of genes transcriptionally regulated through isgf <dig> are increased in expression . a small number of these genes are shown in the interaction network of figure  <dig>  including, mxa, oas <dig>  tnfsf <dig>  ifi <dig>  isg <dig> and nmi. many of the genes that are inducible by type  <dig> interferons can also be transcriptionally regulated directly via other transcription factors. for example, the expression of cd <dig>  mig , ip <dig>  and ccl <dig> is known to be directly regulated via nfkb and irf <dig>  <cit>  as well as indirectly through type  <dig> interferons.

thus, the data demonstrate the complex network of transcriptional regulation initiated through activation of pdc through tlr <dig>  direct tlr7-initiated transcription regulation through irf <dig>  has been documented in pdc  <cit> . the dependence of tlr9-mediated il <dig> induction and pdc survival on nfkb <dig> and c-rel has also been documented  <cit> . tlr7-mediated transcription regulation via irf <dig>  nfkb and ap <dig> has not been demonstrated in pdc but is well documented in other immune cells. further study is required to demonstrate the direct utilization of these transcription factors in tlr <dig> mediated activation of pdc.

in addition to the genes regulated by the transcription factors illustrated in figure  <dig>  analysis in metacore showed that a large number of genes that are increased in expression are known to be regulated by the transcription factors creb <dig>  c-myc and p <dig>  four hr. post-stimulation with tlr <dig> agonists, one would expect transcriptional regulation through other secondary pathways activated by the genes induced in the primary tlr7-mediated pathways. in addition to type  <dig> interferons, a large number of other cytokine and chemokine genes were increased in expression including the chemokines, ccl <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  mip1a, mip1b, and the cytokines tnfa and tnfb. in fact, at  <dig> hr post-stimulation, significant amounts the proteins for il <dig>  il <dig>  tnfα, mip-1α and, mip-1β were produced. these cytokines can act in an autocrine fashion to activate the il <dig> receptors, ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  which are linked to g proteins that can in turn activate various transcription factors. figure  <dig> shows a protein interaction network illustrating the various chemokines induced in pdc and their respective g-protein-coupled receptors. potential activation of the transcription factors creb <dig>  c-myc and nfkb via the chemokine receptors ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and the il <dig> receptors is depicted in figure  <dig>  chemokine receptors activate various guanine nucleotide proteins  including the beta/gamma subunits which result in the activation of the phospholipase beta  and phosphatidyl inositol kinase  pathways  <cit> . these signaling pathways culminate in the activation of various transcription factors including creb, cmyc, and nfkb. in addition to the chemokines for these receptors, one of the g-proteins, gng <dig>  is also increased in expression.

the transcription factors creb <dig>  c-myc and nfkb regulate the transcription of genes important in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. whereas most of the genes regulated by nfkb and creb <dig> are increased in expression, a significant percentage of those regulated by c-myc are decreased in expression. several of the down regulated genes are involved in the regulation of cell cycle and of apoptosis and include caspase  <dig> and btg <dig>  <cit> . genes increased in expression include pro-inflammatory genes, genes with growth factor activity and or proliferative activity including gro <dig>  grog, grob, mcl- <dig>  <cit>  and anti-apoptotic activity, bcl <dig>  c-iap <dig>  cflip, serpinb <dig>  <cit> . thus, the transcription regulatory network shown in figure  <dig> suggests that  <dig> hr post stimulation with tlr <dig> agonists, pdc are programmed for cell survival. this is shown more clearly in figure 8; a protein regulatory network built using a list of genes with go classification of anti-apoptosis as the input nodes.

induction of an anti-apoptotic gene expression program
activation of pdc through tlr <dig> agonists results in the induction of tnfr-associated genes that are known to induce apoptosis. these include tnfa, tnfb and tnfsf <dig> . the protein products of these genes may be expected to induce apoptosis in pdc via autocrine regulation. however, the gene expression data shows that tlr <dig> agonists induce an anti-apoptotic and pro-survival gene expression program in pdc. figure  <dig> depicts a protein regulatory network for tnfr <dig>  tnfrsf <dig>  and tnfrsf <dig> -mediated apoptosis. tnfr ligands such as tnfa, trail and fas ligand exert their apoptotic effect through activation of the caspase cascade which results in the degradation of several proteins critical to cell survival pathways  <cit> . caspase  <dig>  and dapk <dig>  genes central to tnfr <dig>  fasr and tnfrsf <dig>  mediated apoptotic death  <cit>  are decreased in expression concomitant with the decreased expression of apoptosis mediators, several inhibitors of activation of caspases and activators of pro-survival genes are increased in expression. the anti-apoptotic gene bcl <dig> which is increased in expression, inhibits apoptosis mediated by tnfr <dig> and caspase  <dig>  <cit>  and is in turn activated by pro-survival genes such as beta-catenin. the protein products of cflar, c-flips and c-flipl inhibit the death receptor adaptor molecules fadd, daxx and caspase  <dig>  <cit> . other anti-apoptotic genes increased in expression by tlr <dig> agonists in pdc include the pro-survival gene mcl- <dig>  which is tightly regulated by pro-apoptotic genes such as caspase  <dig> and granzyme b  <cit> ; serpinb <dig> which inhibits caspase  <dig> and granzyme b  <cit> ; ciap <dig>  which promotes degradation of caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig> through its ubiquitin ligase activity  <cit> ; and bclxl  which inhibits activation of the tumor suppressor protein p <dig>  <cit> . other pro-survival genes increased in expression include pim- <dig> and tpl <dig> . pim- <dig>  inhibits the pro-apoptotic protein bad   <cit>  and activates the pro-survival gene tpl <dig>   <cit> . figure  <dig> also shows that a number of genes that are positively regulated by the transcription factor p <dig> are decreased in expression, suggesting that transcription from p <dig> may be suppressed. taken together, the gene expression data suggest that activation of pdc by tlr <dig> agonists induces an anti-apoptotic and pro-survival gene expression program, a state necessary for the migration of pdc to inflammatory sites and to lymph nodes.

interferon-inducible genes: antiviral response
interferon-inducible genes regulate cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation, cell death, and t-cell costimulation, activation, and migration. many of these genes also have direct antiviral activity, including mx <dig>   <cit>  oas <dig>  <cit> , pkr   <cit> , isg <dig> , rsad <dig> ,  <cit> , isg <dig>  <cit> , plscr <dig>  <cit> , irf <dig>  irf <dig>  gbp <dig>  ifi-6- <dig> and ifi <dig>  <cit> . genes such as ifih <dig> and ifi <dig> have been shown to regulate cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . the biological function of other interferon-inducible genes such as ifit <dig>  ifit <dig>  ifit <dig>  iftm <dig>  ifi <dig>  g1p <dig>  and isg <dig> are not well understood. however, these genes have been shown to be part of the innate anti-viral response  <cit> . a comprehensive discussion of the biological role of ifn-inducible genes is beyond the scope of this manuscript. the few genes cited here demonstrate the important role that tlr <dig> plays in antiviral, anti-tumor, and immune-regulatory functions in pdc.

protein regulatory network indicates importance of isgylation pathway in tlr7-mediated activation of pdc
one of the interferon-inducible genes increased in expression upon treatment of pdc with tlr <dig> agonists is isg <dig>  interferon stimulated protein  <dig> . isg <dig> has been shown to function as a cytokine which stimulates ifnγ production as well as proliferation of natural killer cells and their cytolytic activity  <cit> . isg <dig> contains two ubiquitin-like domains and is also know to be conjugated to various protein targets  <cit> . the protein isgylation pathway uses a similar set of enzymes to that used by the ubiquitin pathway including the ubiquitin e <dig> like enzyme ube1l  <cit> , the ubiquitin e <dig> enzyme ubch <dig>  <cit>  the hect type ubiquitin e <dig> ligase herc <dig>   <cit>  and the ubiquitin e <dig> liagase efp also known as trim <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, evidence for the importance of protein isgylation following stimulation of pdc with tlr <dig> agonists is provided by increased expression of isg <dig> and genes important in the isgylation pathway. analysis of go process classification showed that  <dig> genes involved in the ubiquitin cycle were altered in expression upon treatment of pdc with 3m-852a and 3m <dig>  figure  <dig> exhibits a protein regulatory network built from this list of genes using the shortest path algorithm, and shows the interactions between the ubiquitin pathway leading to proteasome-dependent protein degradation and the protein isgylation pathway. shown in the interaction network are enzymes common to the ubiquitin and the isgylation pathways ubch <dig>  herc <dig>  and efp and a few of the numerous proteins that are ubiquitinated for protein degradation and those that are isgylated. notable proteins marked for degradation by ubiquitination are those relevant to the immune system such as irf <dig>  irf <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig>   <cit>  among the proteins known to be isgylated are the ubiquitin enzymes ubch <dig> and herc <dig>  <cit> , the anti-viral interferon-inducible genes pkr , mx <dig>  and rig <dig>  <cit> , signaling proteins in the jak-stat pathway including jak <dig>  erk <dig> and stat <dig>  <cit>  and irf <dig>  <cit> , which plays a major role in the innate anti-viral response. evidence for cross regulation of the ubiquitin and isgylation pathways has been reported. isg <dig> has been shown to inhibit the ubiquitin/26s proteasome pathway  <cit> , thus inhibiting the degradation of proteins such as irf <dig>  <cit> . isgylation of the ubiquitin e <dig> enzyme ubc <dig>  has also been shown to disrupt modification of this enzyme by ubiquitin  <cit> .

isg <dig> as well as several of the genes which are known to be isgylated including ubch <dig>  herc <dig> and usp <dig>  and the innate anti-viral response genes rig <dig>  mx <dig>  pkr, and irf <dig> are also known to be inducible by type  <dig> interferons and viruses  <cit> . experiments in isg <dig> knockout mice have shown that ifn-induced antiviral responses of isg15-/- mice to vesicular stomatitis and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus were not significantly altered  <cit> . in contrast, similar experiments show increased susceptibility towards influenza virus, herpes virus type  <dig> , and sindbis viruses  <cit> . the difference in the antiviral activity of isg <dig> towards the different viruses is not clear. it is postulated that the antiviral effectiveness isg <dig> may depend on the effectiveness of mechanisms the particular virus may have evolved to counteract it. for example, influenza b virus produces a viral protein, ns1b which is capable of binding to isg <dig> to prevent protein isgylation  <cit> . similar mechanisms in vesicular stomatitis and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus may function to strongly counteract the antiviral effects of isg <dig> as seen the work of osiak et al  <cit> . the increased expression of enzymes important for isgylation as well as innate antiviral genes that are targets of isgylation thus underscores the importance of protein isgylation in the innate, anti-viral response of pdc stimulated with tlr <dig> agonists.

change in expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors
the gene expression analysis in this study shows that activation of pdc results in increased expression of a large number of other cytokines and chemokines in addition to type  <dig> interferons . figure  <dig> shows a protein interaction network for several cc and cxc chemokines induced by tlr <dig> agonists in pdc. the highest induced chemokines are ligands for cxcr <dig> with expression changes ranging from 20-fold to 120-fold. the cxcr <dig> ligands include ccl <dig>  which is chemotactic for memory t cells and monocytes, cxcl <dig>   and cxcl <dig>  which are chemotactic for activated t cells, and the pleotrophic chemokine cxcl <dig>  which stimulates monocytes, natural killer  cells and t cells, and modulates their migration  <cit> . in addition to cxcr <dig>  ccl <dig> also activates the chemokine receptors ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ccr <dig>  the ligands for the chemokine receptors cxcr <dig>  and cxcr <dig> ; il <dig>  cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , and cxcl <dig>  are chemotactic for a number of cell types including t cells, b cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells  <cit> . these chemokines are induced to a lower degree  than the cxcr <dig> ligands cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  thus, the data suggest that tlr7-activated pdc predominantly influence migration of activated t cells.

only two chemokine receptors are altered in expression upon activation of pdc by tlr <dig> agonists; cxcr <dig> which is deceased in expression and ccr <dig>  which is increased in expression. cxcr <dig> is the receptor for cxcl <dig> , bone marrow stromal cells and tumor stromal cells  <cit> . in contrast, the ligands for ccr7; ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> are expressed by hev as well as stromal cells within t cell-rich areas  <cit> . in addition, increased expression of ccr <dig> on dendritic cells is critical for migration to lymph nodes  <cit> . thus, the increased expression of ccr <dig> with the concomitant decrease in expression of cxcr <dig> more specifically predisposes tlr <dig> activated pdc to migrate to lymph nodes. it is interesting to note that cxcr <dig> is one of the receptors for entrance of hiv- <dig> into pdc  <cit> . the reduced expression of cxcr <dig> may thus have a dual role, in pdc migration and as an anti-viral mechanism.

activation of pdc for antigen processing and presentation and t-cell co-stimulation
activation of pdc by tlr <dig> agonists alters the expression of various genes involved in antigen processing and presentation . tap <dig> and tap <dig>  antigen peptide transporter  <dig> and  <dig> were moderately increased in expression. genes involved in antigen presentation were also increased in expression, including a low and donor dependent increase in hladqa <dig>  and a stronger increase in lamp <dig> . various genes involved in t cell costimulation were also increased in expression including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in addition, tnfrsf <dig>  and its ligand tnfsf <dig>  were increased in expression. tnfsf <dig> expressed on dendritic cells is known to interact with tnfrsf <dig> on activated t cells resulting in th <dig> polarization and, t, and nk cell survival and expansion  <cit> . it is interesting that both the receptor and ligand-pair are increased in expression upon stimulation of pdc with tlr <dig> agonists, suggesting a role for this pair of molecules in pdc signal transduction. thus, as early as  <dig> hr post-stimulation with tlr <dig> agonists, pdc are primed for antigen processing and presentation as well as co-stimulation of cells of the adaptive immune system.

activation of pdc through tlr <dig> leads to increased expression of genes in innate anti-viral pathways which respond to rna viruses
regulation of expression of type  <dig> interferons through tlr <dig> is believed to involve irf <dig> and the adaptor molecule myd <dig>  <cit> . in this study we show that stimulation of pdc with tlr <dig> agonists results in increased expression of genes known to be involved in tlr7-signaling and/or in signaling through other tlrs. the tlr <dig> adaptor molecule myd <dig>  tab <dig>  and nfκb  <cit>  are increased in expression. in addition, genes that interact with traf <dig>  the central mediator of signaling through several tlrs; such as map3k <dig> , and tnfaip <dig>  were also increased in expression. map3k <dig> has been shown to interact with traf <dig>  ikk-alpha and nfκb  <cit>  and is required for tlr-mediated erk activation and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . tnfaip <dig> is now recognized as a negative regulator of tlr signaling  <cit>  as well as signaling through the cytosolic anti-viral pathway mediated by rig <dig>  <cit> . ripk <dig>  which activates ikk-alpha  resulting in irf7-mediated induction of ifna  <cit>  and nfκb-mediated induction of chemokines  <cit>  was also increased in expression. thus, activation of tlr <dig> by tlr <dig> agonists results in increased expression of signaling components of tlr <dig> as well as other tlrs, thus potentially amplifying tlr signaling pathways. while some genes are positive drivers of the signaling pathways others are negative regulators of the pathways, indicating tight regulation of these signals.

in addition to known components of tlr <dig> signaling, genes in the signaling pathways for tlr <dig> and the cytosolic innate anti-viral pathway mediated by the rna helicases mda <dig>  and rig <dig>  are over-expressed. also over-expressed are mda <dig> and lgp <dig> , gene that is known to be a negative regulator of the rig <dig> pathway  <cit> . pkr, a double stranded rna activated protein kinase, is also increased in expression. in the tlr3-signaling pathway, ticam <dig>  the adaptor molecule for tlr3- <cit>  is increased in expression. these four pathways share a common characteristic in that the natural agonists of these pathways are rna-based, single stranded rna  for tlr <dig>  <cit> ; double stranded rna  for tlr <dig>  <cit> , pkr  <cit>  and mda5; and ssrna and dsrna for rig <dig>  <cit> . thus, the data indicate that signaling through tlr <dig> may potentially prime and amplify signaling through tlr <dig>  pkr, and the cytosolic antiviral pathway. the net effect of this may be an optimization of the anti-viral response against rna viruses. this conclusion is consistent with the synergy between various tlrs including tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> observed for the induction of cytokines and cytotoxic t cell responses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have made the first comprehensive global gene expression analysis of high purity pdc stimulated with tlr <dig> agonists. even though the induction of type  <dig> interferons by tlr <dig> agonists in pdc has been well documented, we show the first evidence that a variety of ifna subtypes as well as ifnb genes are induced. given the evidence that ifna subtypes differ in potency in their anti-viral and anti-tumor activities, the induction of a variety of ifna subtypes and ifnb by tlr <dig> agonists may be an advantage over therapies that utilize a single ifna subtype. in addition to increased expression of type  <dig> interferons, which can prime other immune and non-immune cells for anti-viral response, pdc produce a large number of chemokines and cytokines which can recruit and modulate the activity of a variety of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. the data also provides evidence for autocrine transcriptional regulation which results in increased expression of a large number of interferon-inducible genes with known anti-viral activity, thus indicating a strong antiviral role of this cell type. potential autocrine regulation by chemokines is also implicated in the large number of genes regulated by other transcription factors such as creb <dig>  in addition, the increased expression of the interferon-inducible gene isg <dig>  and several enzymes responsible for isglyation as well as genes know to be isgylated, underscores the importance of the isgylation pathway in activated pdc. the exact role protein isgylation plays in activated pdc is not clear. the fact that several substrates of isg <dig> which are also known to have anti-viral activity are increased in expression suggests a potential role for protein isgylation in the anti-viral activity of pdc. even as early as  <dig> hr post stimulation, the gene expression data provides evidence for increased capacity for antigen processing and presentation and t cell co-stimulatory capacity. a distinct anti-apoptotic gene expression finger print also shows that stimulation with tlr <dig> agonists programs pdc for increased cell survival.

finally, the data demonstrate the capacity for tlr7-mediated amplification of the innate immune response in pdc. stimulation of the tlr <dig> pathway results in increased expression of components of tlr7-signaling. in addition, signaling components of three other innate anti-viral pathways which respond to rna viruses, tlr <dig>  pkr and the cytosolic rig1/mda <dig> pathway are also increased in expression suggesting priming to maximize anti-viral response towards rna viruses. while the data demonstrates the capacity of the innate immune response to amplify itself, increased expression of negative regulators of the three pathways indicates a tight regulation so as to prevent uncontrolled inflammation.

in summary, the gene expression analysis in this study provides valuable insight into the molecular pathways and processes altered in pdc upon stimulation with tlr <dig> agonists. the study also underscores the powerful immune stimulatory capacity of synthetic tlr <dig> agonists and their potential and demonstrated use in anti-viral and anti-tumor therapies. 3m-852a is currently in phase ii clinical study for cancer therapy.
