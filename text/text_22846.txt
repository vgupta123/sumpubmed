BACKGROUND
the superfamily of major intrinsic proteins  contains channel proteins that transport water and other neutral solutes  <cit> – <cit> . these integral membrane proteins are found from bacteria to humans and are abundantly present in plants  <cit> , <cit> . aquaporin  and aquaglyceroporin  are the prototype members of the mip superfamily  <cit> , <cit> . while in mammals three major subfamilies are detected  <cit> , plant mips are found to have at least five subfamilies  <cit> – <cit> . in humans, mip members play significant role in kidney nephron, epithelial fluid secretion, maintaining brain water balance, cell migration, skin hydration, adipocyte metabolism and neuroexcitation  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . they are implicated in various human diseases such as glaucoma, epilepsy, cancer, obesity, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and neuromyelitis optica  <cit> – <cit> . in plants, multiple roles have been recognized in terms of plant development, growth and physiology  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . they have been shown to be important in stress tolerance in plants and they play vital role in their interactions with soil microorganisms, fungi and pathogens  <cit> – <cit> . in addition to water and glycerol, expression studies in xenopus oocytes showed that mips transport diverse neutral solutes and gases such as ammonia and co <dig> <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . mip members also serve as an important component in host-parasite interactions and several protozoan parasite aquaporins have been identified including those from plasmodium, trypanosoma and leishmania species  <cit> – <cit> . functional studies suggest that protozoan aquaporins are likely to transport both water and glycerol efficiently  <cit> . these parasite channel proteins could either serve as potential drug targets or vehicles for transporting cytotoxic compounds  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . we have recently identified more than  <dig> mip genes from more than  <dig> organisms and details about the genes, protein products and structural models are available in mipmoddb database  <cit> .

symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi occurs through mycorrhiza and these interactions help in translocating soil nutrients to the host plants  <cit> , <cit> . this mutualistic association also aids in the transfer of organic carbon from plants to fungal partners  <cit> . in the mycorrhized plants, movement of water and other nutrients are greatly influenced by the expression of both plant and fungal aquaporins and this plays a major role in the drought resistance of plants  <cit> , <cit> . the expression of plant aquaporins in mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized forms have been investigated in several plants under different stress conditions  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . on the contrary, very few studies have been carried out on the role of fungal aquaporins in mycorrhizal symbiosis  <cit> , <cit> . in addition to their role in root water transport in plants through symplastic pathway, fungal aquaporins present in pathogenic fungal species may act as attractive targets for antifungal drugs  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . with increasing drug resistance reported in human fungal pathogens  <cit> , <cit> , it has become even more important to identify new drug targets in fungal organisms.

fungal aquaporins have been identified in individual species such as laccaria bicolor   <cit> glomus intraradices   <cit>  and encephalitozoon cuniculi   <cit> . their transport properties, gene expression profiles and role in mycorrhizia or pathogenesis have been investigated. available literature shows that only a few fungal mips have been studied in detail. fungal species are diverse and form a large group of eukaryotic organisms and hence it is anticipated that the mip channels present in fungi also could be diverse with different transport specificities and unique regulatory mechanisms and/or physiological functions. in an earlier study, pettersson et al.  <cit>  analyzed genomes of yeast and filamentous fungi. their phylogenetic analysis with a small number of  <dig> mips revealed three different subgroups within fungal aqgps in addition to members belonging to orthodox aqp family. a new subfamily of fungal aquaporins, called x-intrinsic proteins , has been discovered in our laboratory which is found to be common between fungi and plants  <cit> . more recently, dietz et al.  <cit>  and zwiazek and coworkers  <cit>  have identified even a larger number of  <dig> and  <dig> fungal mips respectively from database searches. both their phylogenetic studies indicated at least four clusters including the orthodox aqps, xips and two to four distinct subgroups of aqgps. with the improved technologies and falling costs of sequencing, fungal genomes are rapidly sequenced and they are available in public databases. in this study, we have systematically searched completely and partially sequenced fungal genomes and identified a large number of fungal mips. with a comprehensive analysis of these mip sequences using different bioinformatics tools, we have identified a new group of fungal mips which forms a distinct cluster separately from the orthodox aqps and aqgps. members of this new family share several features with plant sip  subfamily. our analysis also revealed two new subfamilies of aquaglyceroporins which are separate from the other subgroups of aqgps. distinct features of these three new families of fungal mips, their possible evolutionary relationship with plants and lower organisms and the nature of solutes that are likely to be transported across these channels are presented in detail.

RESULTS
identification of fungal mips and their taxonomic distributions
ten mip sequences representing different subfamilies and organism groups were used as query sequences in the psi-blast and blast searches to search the non-redundant database in ncbi  and uniprot  database  <cit>  respectively. although the mip sequences are diverse, they all adopt a characteristic hour-glass helical fold consisting of six transmembrane helical segments  and two functionally important loops with half-helices  which meet in the middle of the membrane . in addition to the above sequences, we also used sequences belonging to fungal xip subfamily  <cit>  as query sequences. among the  <dig> phyla present in the kingdom of fungi  <cit> , <cit> , at the time of database search, genome sequences of  <dig> phyla were available either in completed form  or in the form of whole genome shotgun sequences . our search, as described in the methods section, yielded  <dig> fungal mip sequences. additional  <dig> sequences were taken from the studies of xu et al.  <cit>  and many are found in the database of joint genome institute . the phylogenetic analysis of all  <dig> fungal mip sequences is presented in figure 2a. it is clearly evident that there are two major clusters representing aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. the dominant aqp and aqgp clusters contain  <dig> and  <dig> members respectively. the third cluster containing the xip sequences was identified in our earlier studies  <cit> . in the present study, we report  <dig> xip sequences and this group is common to both fungi and plants. this analysis shows another cluster with  <dig> sequences distinct from the above mentioned three groups. we name this cluster as sip-like mip sequences. sips form one of the subgroups within plant mips  <cit>  and they are small and basic intrinsic proteins. the reasons for naming this fungal mip cluster as sip-like sequences are discussed in the following sections. in the case of aqgps, the subgroups identified in earlier studies  <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  are present in our analysis also. we have also identified two additional aqgp subgroups in our analysis . sequences, structural models and other associated details of all  <dig> sequences from  <dig> different fungal organisms are available in our mipmoddb database   <cit> . the accession codes of these sequences from genbank or jgi are provided in the additional file 1: table s <dig> 

taxonomical distribution of fungal mips
taxonomical distribution of different clusters and the subgroups are also indicated in figure  <dig>  the orthodox fungal aqps are present mainly in the species of ascomycota  and the rest are found in filamentous basidiomycota. only two examples are found in glomeromycota and a lone representative is from mucoromycotina. all xips are found in ascomycota filamentous fungi. among the fungal aqgps, we have identified two additional subgroups in this study apart from the known subgroups. they have different taxonomic distributions. the phylogenetic tree of all fungal aqgps is presented in figure 2b. the fps1-like aqgps are found invariably in yeast ascomycota while the yfl054-like aqgps, also known as facultative aquaporins  <cit> , are predominantly identified in yeast and filamentous ascomycota. the other major subgroups classified as α and β are mainly found in ascomycota  and basidomycota  respectively. there are two small subgroups which we have designated as γ <dig> and γ <dig>  the γ <dig> cluster has been previously recognized  <cit>  and is mainly found in the species of mucoromycotina. the second cluster γ <dig> is newly recognized in this study and is found in filamentous ascomycota. the major fungal aqgp subgroup newly identified from this analysis consists of  <dig> members and the members of this group are found in filamentous ascomycota and basidiomycota . we have named this cluster as δ. the new fungal mip group, which is distinct from orthodox aqps and aqgps, are found exclusively in microsporidia and these parasitic species are known to infect their animal hosts. in this context, it is even more important to understand and characterize this mip group. we have designated this group as “sip-like” fungal mips since they possess several characteristics of plant sip subgroup  <cit>  . from this analysis, it appears that some fungal mip subfamilies such as xips and the newly identified sip-like members are exclusive to a single fungal phylum . however, one has to keep in mind that the present analysis was carried out with limited number of available fungal genome sequences. when more fungal genome sequences are available, it is possible that mip members from these subfamilies may be found in other fungal phyla also.

characterization of new fungal mip cluster that is distinct from aqps, aqgps and xips
sixteen fungal mips form a cluster separate from aqps, aqgps and xips. average pairwise sequence identity of all these  <dig> sequences is about 54% and similarity is close to 70%. we also calculated the average pairwise sequence identity between the sequences from the newly identified cluster and all the sequences belonging to the clusters of orthodox aqps and xips. a similar exercise was carried out for all the subgroups of aqgps also. the results of pairwise sequence analysis are given in additional file 2: table s <dig>  inter-group average sequence identity varies from  <dig> to 27% and similarity varies from  <dig> to 44% indicating that this group of sequences exhibits a large degree of divergence from all other fungal mip sequences.

mip subfamilies within plants have been shown to have different biochemical properties  <cit> . to find out whether the newly identified fungal mip group exhibits differential properties, we plotted isoelectric point versus molecular weight for each fungal mip groups and subgroups. we also carried out comparative studies of fungal mip groups with plant mip subfamilies . our analysis shows that members of the newly identified fungal mip cluster are smaller in size and have molecular weight similar to that found for the plant tip and sip subfamilies. while sip members are more basic, the new fungal mip sequences have almost equal distribution of acidic and basic residues.

analysis of ar/r selectivity filter residues
to further characterize the new subfamily, we constructed homology models of all fungal mip sequences as described in the methods section. we particularly focused on the aromatic/arginine selectivity filter residues that have been shown to play significant role in determining the selectivity of the solutes to be transported  <cit> – <cit> . the four residues are contributed by tm <dig>  tm <dig> and the two loop residues from loop e, le <dig> and le <dig> . as the name suggests, usually the tm <dig> position is predominantly occupied by an aromatic residue and the le <dig> position is almost always an arginine residue. this is true for majority of other groups of fungal mip sequences except the newly identified family. it has neither aromatic nor arginine residue in its selectivity filter. both the tm <dig> and le <dig> positions are occupied by bulky hydrophobic residues and small residues  are found in the other two positions tm <dig> and le <dig> . sequence logo  <cit>  produced for loop e region also clearly highlights this fact . while all the aqgp subfamilies and aqp and xip clusters possess the highly conserved arginine which forms part of the selectivity filter, only the newly identified fungal mip cluster is devoid of this arginine residue in its selectivity filter. since no fungal mip subgroup has this feature, we looked at the selectivity filter residues of plant sip and tip subfamilies. in both cases, we found members in which aromatic or arginine residue is absent in the selectivity filter . a significant number of tips do not have arginine as part of the selectivity filter. however, there is a histidine in tm <dig> position which could provide necessary basic character in the place of arginine. analysis of  <dig> plant sips from different species reveals that none of them have the arginine residue. although in some cases an aromatic residue is found in tm2/tm5/le <dig> position, the selectivity filter of plant sip members is in general more hydrophobic as in the newly identified fungal mip group .

brachypodium distachyon, sorghum bicolor, oryza sativa, zea mays, setaria italic, triticum aestivum, arabidopsis thaliana, solanum tuberosum, solanum lycopersicum, populus trichocarpa.

substitutions in the highly conserved npa boxes
the third factor we examined is the substitution in the highly conserved npa motifs. in majority of the members belonging to the newly identified fungal mip cluster, alanine residue of npa motif from loop e has been substituted . substitution of conserved npa motif is also common in plant sip subfamily . while in almost all plant tips both npa motifs are strictly conserved, substitution in npa motif of loop b is observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> sip members. thus the newly identified fungal mip group resembles more like the plant sip subfamily in terms of the molecular weight, nature of selectivity filter residues and substitution in the highly conserved npa motifs. hence, we have classified this new fungal mip cluster as “sip-like” subfamily taking all these factors into account. in our previous studies we have demonstrated that mip sequences show high group conservation of residues at  <dig> positions which occur at the helix-helix interface of the hour-glass helical fold  <cit> , <cit> . analysis of the sip-like members in fungi reveals that  <dig> out of  <dig> positions exhibit very high group conservation confirming that the new members have characteristic features of mip superfamily . further analysis shows that the sip-like subfamily members have small n- and c-termini regions and the loop d connecting tm <dig> and tm <dig> is the longest in this family compared to all other fungal mip clusters . this loop in sip-like mips also possesses highest number of charged residues among all fungal mip subgroups.

characterization of δ subfamily of fungal aqgps
the newly identified sip-like fungal mip family is distinct from aqps, aqgps and xips within fungal mip family. within the fungal aqgp group, five different subgroups have already been identified in a recently published study  <cit> . in the current study, we have also identified two additional subgroups distinct from the previously identified fungal aqgp clusters. the biggest cluster is δ with  <dig> members . the average pairwise sequence identity and similarity within this group are about 51% and 67% respectively. this indicates that the sequences within the group are closely related. however, the same cannot be said for aqgp members from other subgroups. the inter-group average sequence identity between δ cluster and other aqgp groups varies from 24% to 30% indicating that δ subgroup members have diverged significantly and are distantly related to other fungal aqgp groups . hence, our study mainly focused on features that are unique to δ cluster aqgps and hence, we present our analysis by comparing δ subgroup with other fungal aqgp groups.

we have analyzed the molecular weight of these sequences as a function of isoelectric point and compared them with other fungal aqgp subgroups. we did not find any feature in this plot that distinguishes δ from other fungal aqgp clusters . we then analyzed the selectivity filter residues from the homology models we have generated. all the members from this subgroup contain arginine in the le <dig> position and the tm <dig> position is predominantly occupied by an aromatic residue . the other two positions from tm <dig> and le <dig> are preferred by bulky aliphatic residues ile, leu and val . this results in a relatively more hydrophobic environment in the selectivity filter region. this also distinguishes δ from α, β, and γ <dig> members in which two aromatic residues are found in tm <dig> and le <dig> positions and usually a small residue is found in tm <dig> position . in the subgroups fps1-like and facultative aquaporins, at least one position is occupied by a small residue. thus it is clear that the δ subgroup mip members have selectivity filter distinct from other fungal aqgps. we anticipate that members from this group are likely to transport relatively more hydrophobic solutes.

we have examined the conservation of the signature npa motifs in loops lb and le and compared the pattern with other aqgps. while the npa motif of loop lb is substituted in some members of δ cluster, the proline residue is invariably replaced in almost every member in the second npa motif that occurs in le . this is also observed in α cluster and fps1-like members. analysis of sequences in the loop b region reveals that the highly conserved asn in the npa motif is substituted by ser or his in some of δ aqgps indicating that side-chains of these residues are likely to play a similar role as that of asn . sequence logo of loop le region reveals strict conservation of an aspartate and an arginine residue near the npa motif of loop le in all aqgp members . these two residues are separated by four positions enabling them to form a salt-bridge interaction in the half-helix formed by the le loop . such an interaction gives additional stability to the helical region within le and the residues forming these interactions do not face the channel interior. such a stabilizing interaction seems to be unique to aqgps from fungi and other organisms . the acidic and basic residues are not conserved in orthodox aqps from fungi, xips and the newly identified sip-like mips . molecular dynamics simulations of mammalian aqp, e. coli aqgp and plasmodium aqgp reveal that while the half-helix le is stable in e.coli and plasmodium aqgps, unwinding of le half-helix is observed in mammalian aqp  <cit> . in aqgps from e. coli and plasmodium, the intra-helical salt-bridge interaction gives additional stability to the half-helix in loop le. since loop le contributes two out of four residues  for the ar/r selectivity filter, we speculate that the unwinding character may help in regulating the channel transport in orthodox aqps that lack the intra-helical salt-bridge interaction. however in the case of fungal aqgps, presence of this interaction seems to maintain the helix stable and there could be other mechanisms to regulate the channel function. in this respect, it is important to note the two highly conserved residues, glycine and proline, are present between the acidic and basic residue positions in all fungal aqgp groups except the δ cluster of aqgps . both these residues are known to be helix breakers. it appears that the helix stability of loop e half-helix is balanced by two opposing forces, one with stabilizing interaction and the other with the tendency to break helices. in the case of δ cluster, the proline residue is not conserved . hence, we can anticipate that the half-helix in loop e in δ cluster will be relatively more stable than other fungal aqgps.

γ <dig> cluster of aqgps
this small group contains only  <dig> members forming a separate cluster within the fungal aqgps  and all of them belong to filamentous ascomycota. their selectivity filter contains a tyr residue at le <dig> position which seems to be a feature shared by many members of α and β clusters . the tm <dig> position is preferred by a bulky residue  and le <dig> position is occupied by arg. there is no strikingly different feature observed in this small group. perhaps, a larger dataset would help to identify unique characteristics of small clusters like γ <dig> and γ <dig> 

discussion
fungal mips are as diverse as plant mips
the diversity of plant mips has been established in many earlier studies  <cit> – <cit> . only few studies identified and addressed the extent of diversity in fungal mips  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . in the present study, by identifying two major clusters and one minor cluster within the fungal mip superfamily, we have determined that fungal mips are as diverse as their plant counterparts. till date, the only mip subgroup common to both plant and fungal species has been found to be xips  <cit> . however, by systematically searching the genome sequences of fungal species, we have recognized another group in fungal mips which has common features with plant sip subfamily. although phylogenetic analysis cluster the newly identified “sip-like” fungal mips separately from the plant sips, several features are shared by the two mip families from the two different species group. the small size of the channel protein, the nature of selectivity filter residues and substitutions in the conserved npa boxes indicate that the new fungal mip cluster shares some characteristic features with plant sips.

unique selectivity filter suggests that sip-like mips are likely to transport larger hydrophobic solutes
very few functional studies have been carried on fungal mips  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . experimental, structural and simulation studies have emphasized the role of the aromatic/arginine selectivity filter in mip channel’s transport and selectivity  <cit> – <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . in this context, it would be interesting to at least make a speculation regarding the transport properties of sip-like fungal mips based on the selectivity filter residues. even for plant sips, not many studies have been reported regarding their function. when arabidopsis sips  were expressed in yeast, at least one of the two members displayed water channel activity  <cit> . this water transport has been reported in spite of the fact that the aromatic/arginine selectivity filter of atsips lacks the arginine residue. in a recent study  <cit> , an aquaporin aqp <dig> from the protozoan parasite trypanosoma brucei gambiense or trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense has been shown to have an unusual selectivity filter comprising of large hydrophobic residues ivll. t. brucei causes sleeping sickness in humans and with all hydrophobic residues in the selectivity filter without any aromatic and arginine residue, this aquaporin has been shown to play a vital role in increased cross resistance to the drugs melarsoprol and pentamidine  <cit> . based on their studies, baker et al.  <cit>  have suggested that t. brucei aquaporin aqp <dig> may function as a transporter of pentamidine and melarsoprol drugs. both drugs with molecular mass above 330 da are larger molecules compared to glycerol . it is suggested that the unique selectivity filter of aqp <dig> from t. brucei with bulky hydrophobic residues may facilitate the transport of large molecules.

we have also examined all non-plant mips whose selectivity filter lacks arginine residue. in mipmoddb  <cit>  which has more than  <dig> mips, we could find only  <dig> examples in which arginine is absent in the selectivity filter. among them, only  <dig> of them including mammalian aqp <dig> have features similar to that found in sip-like fungal mips . we found that in mammalian aqp <dig>  both tm <dig> and le <dig> positions are occupied by leu residues and ala is found in tm <dig> and le <dig> positions. although no direct functional studies are reported for aqp <dig>  it has been speculated that aqp <dig> may regulate proper secretion of pancreatic fluid or digestive enzymes  <cit> , <cit> . thus, plant sips, aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> of t. brucei also have selectivity filters similar to fungal sip-like mips with all four positions occupied by hydrophobic residues and arginine is absent. based on the available literature on other mips with similar features, we conclude that the sip-like fungal mips are likely to transport solutes which are novel, hydrophobic and larger in size. the same argument may hold good for the plant sips also.

loop d in sip-like members may play a role in regulating the channel function
the sip-like fungal mips exhibit some characteristic features in loop d which connects the tm <dig> and tm <dig> helices. the average length of loop d is the longest in sip-like cluster compared to all other fungal mip subgroups . moreover, large number of charged residues is found in loop d in sip-like members. this observation indicates that loop d in sip-like mips can play a special role in the function of these channels. loop d in some mammalian and plant aquaporin channels have been shown to be important in channel gating and regulation of channel function. experimental and computational studies in aqp <dig>  spinach aquaporin sopip2; <dig> and aqp <dig> have suggested a role for loop d in channel gating  <cit> , <cit>  or binding site for channel agonists  <cit>  or antagonists  <cit> . specific residues in loop d which respond to ph have been shown to be responsible for the closed state in aqp <dig> channel  <cit> . the arginine-rich loop d in aqp <dig> has also been shown to bind cgmp which seems to initiate channel opening  <cit> . loop d in aqp <dig> serves as a possible region for metal-binding activity and has also been implicated in regulating the channel activity  <cit> , <cit> . structural studies on spinach aquaporin characterized the open and closed states and exhibited two different conformations of loop d revealing that the gating mechanism at molecular level involves a large movement of this loop  <cit> . the available experimental and simulation studies provide a clue for the role of loop d in fungal sip-like mips. the charged residues in this loop could be involved in binding ions or molecules that could trigger the channel opening and closing. the longer loop in this subfamily can easily adopt different conformations that can regulate the channel transport. both possibilities can also simultaneously exist implying that the loop d in sip-like channels should be given specific attention while investigating the structure-function relationship of these subgroup members.

sip-like channels could be attractive targets for some anti-fungal diseases
it is interesting to note that all the sip-like members are from the lower fungi microsporidia. we did not find even a single example from higher fungi. although micorsporidia were earlier classified as part of the kingdom protozoa, these spore-forming unicellular parasites are now known to be fungi. they infect both humans and animals and cause microsporidiosis in humans  <cit> . as human pathogens they cause diarrhea and infections in immune-compromised individuals . hence, understanding the host-pathogen interactions and the infection mechanism is extremely important that will aid in developing anti-fungal drugs. sip-like members in microsporidia are unique in several respects. they are small in size and the channels formed by them have hydrophobic selectivity filters. the loop d in these channels is longer and is highly charged. the nature of molecules that are transported through these channels and the role of loop d in regulating the channel function have to be first experimentally investigated. although human aqp <dig> has similar selectivity filter, phylogenetic analysis clearly clusters them into separate clades. hence, sip-like mip channels in disease causing microsporidial fungi can be considered as attractive drug targets.

fungal aqgps have the largest number of subfamilies
with the identification of δ and γ <dig> aqgp subfamilies in this study, fungal aqgps can be classified into seven different subgroups . to our knowledge, the kingdom of fungi possesses the largest subfamilies within the major group of aqgps. this makes the fungal aqgps as the most diverse among all known aqgps compared to any major organism groups. in majority of fungal aqgps, trp is found to be preferred in the tm <dig> position of the selectivity filter and arg is absolutely conserved in le <dig> position of all fungal aqgps . most of the variations are seen in tm <dig> and le <dig> positions. members of γ <dig> aqgps and the newly identified δ subgroup of aqgps defy the trend observed in tm <dig> position. while trp is absent in members of both the clusters, a small polar residue  is found in γ <dig> at tm <dig> position. however in δ subgroup, bulky residues of hydrophobic nature  are found in tm <dig>  tm <dig> and le <dig> positions. as in sip-like mips, the selectivity filter of δ aqgps appears to be unique. we searched mipmoddb database with more than  <dig> mip members looking for examples with similar features in their selectivity filters. we could find only four mips in which the channel selectivity filter is formed by three bulky hydrophobic residues and the fourth position is occupied by an arginine residue.

as mentioned earlier, δ subgroup of aqgps has been found in filamentous ascomycota and yeast and filamentous basidiomycota. many examples from this species group are known to be plant pathogens  <cit>  . members belonging to this group have been identified to cause serious diseases in wide range of plants including agriculturally important cereals such as rice, wheat, rye and barley. they also affect economically important crops like cotton. these pathogens display resistance to fungicides and δ subgroup of aqgps can be considered as an important target to contain these plant pathogens.

loop e as a marker to study the evolution of mips
loop e provides two residues for the selectivity filter. it also possesses one of the two conserved npa motifs. while the other conserved npa motif resides in loop b, majority of the positions in this loop show variations . in the case of loop e, this region seems to show some distinctive features depending upon the subgroups. six out of seven aqgps exhibit a conserved motif rdxgpr next to the npa motif in loop e . a very high conservation of acidic and basic residues separated by four positions will enable the formation of salt-bridge interaction in the half-helix. however, as mentioned earlier, the presence of two helix destabilizing residues gly and pro will weaken the stability of the same helix. in δ aqgps, the motif present is rdxgxr and the pro residue next to gly is mostly substituted by other residues. hence, we can think of the half-helix in δ aqgps as relatively more stable compared to all other fungal aqgp subgroups. in xips, the acidic and basic residues are replaced by a strictly conserved cysteine and mostly bulky residues  respectively. the motif in xips is found to be rcxxx. sip-like members exhibit no such conserved motif in this region. in orthodox aqps, the acidic and basic residues are replaced by small residues and the conservation pattern in the same region is rxg. it should be noted that the absence of intra-helical salt-bridge and the conservation of gly and to some extent pro in aqps will render this half-helix relatively less stable compared to the same region in aqgps in general and δ-aqgps in particular. an extensive bioinformatics analysis of mips from microbial organisms to mammals in loop e is necessary and this may spring some surprising insights into the evolution of mips.

CONCLUSIONS
the role of different fungal proteins in the symbiotic relationship with plants needs to be clearly established. similarly, host-pathogen interactions at the time of fungi-induced infection require understanding at the molecular level. in this context, understanding the evolution, function and diversity of fungal mip channels has become very significant. experimental studies clearly reveal that mip channels are important players in plant-fungi interactions. identification of new targets for anti-fungal drugs is a major goal for several human diseases caused by fungi and mip channels could be considered as attractive anti-fungal targets. in the present study, analysis of fungal genome sequences has identified additional mip channels in different species groups within the kingdom of fungi. phylogenetic analysis of nearly  <dig> fungal mip channels has revealed the existence of a new mip cluster completely distinct from the orthodox aqp and aqgp channels. further sequence analysis and homology modeling studies indicate features that are shared between the new fungal mip cluster and the plant sip subfamily. the size of the protein, chemical nature of the residues that form the narrow aromatic/arginine selectivity filter and the substitutions found in the conserved npa motifs are the common characteristics between the new family and the plant sip channels. hence in addition to the xips, this “sip-like” fungal mip channels can possibly be another evolutionary link between the plants and fungi. since sip-like channels are observed only in microsporidia which are the unicellular parasites, they can also be considered as drug targets for developing anti-fungal drugs in human infections caused by fungi.

we have also identified one major subgroup and another minor cluster within the fungal aqgp family. the δ-subgroup with  <dig> members have unique selectivity filter very rarely found in other mip channels. with the discovery of these two new aqgp subfamilies, it appears that fungal aqgps are the most diverse among all known aqgps. many fungal species possessing δ-aqgps also are known to act as plant pathogens. the newly identified δ-group mip channels can be exploited to contain some of the serious infections affecting agriculturally and economically important crops.

with very few functional studies available in fungal mip channels, the present study has given a picture of the diverse fungal organisms evolved with two new mip subfamilies with unique selectivity filter residues. the possible solutes that are transported through these narrow regions within the channel interior, the role of loop d in sip-like channels and the importance of these channels in the fungal life cycles are some of the immediate questions that have to be addressed by researchers in this field.
