BACKGROUND
for many years, the improvement of microbial strains by non-targeted approaches, such as random mutagenesis, crossbreeding or evolutionary engineering, has been successfully used in situations where the knowledge of the biochemistry and genetics associated to the relevant pathways was limited, as well as when complex connections of multiple metabolic and regulatory pathways restricted the manipulation of the strains by targeted approaches  <cit> . however, once a superior phenotype has been obtained by a non-targeted approach, the identification of molecular mechanisms behind the improved traits becomes a challenging process. such elucidation, however, is of great importance since it enables the re-introduction of only the relevant mutations to other strains, thereby avoiding the accumulation of negative mutations or trade-off events that may have occurred during the selection process  <cit> . in addition, the identification of genetic features and mechanisms behind a phenotype of interest is expected to improve our knowledge and understanding of complex biological systems.

baker’s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important protagonist in industrial biotechnology and it is considered the biocatalyst of choice for the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass  <cit> . however, the tolerance of s. cerevisiae to stressors encountered during the ethanol production process, such as heat, lignocellulose-derived inhibitors, salts, contaminants, among others, needs to be further improved.

many aspects of the response of s. cerevisiae towards environmental stressors have already been elucidated in this model eukaryote . furthermore, different mechanisms by which this yeast responds to the different types of inhibitors that are found in lignocellulosic hydrolysate, such as furaldehydes, weak organic acids and phenolic compounds, have been also identified  <cit> . in fact, the various reports of long-term adaptation experiments oriented to improve the tolerance of s. cerevisiae to a single or to a mix of hydrolysate-derived inhibitors  have helped to reveal some of the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the superior traits in the evolved strains, notably including the up-regulation of reductases capable of the conversion of furaldehydes to less inhibitory compounds  <cit> . in contrast, the effect of high temperature on yeast physiology has mainly been studied through heat shock experiments, that is, when cells are shortly exposed to high temperatures . studies on long-term adaptation of s. cerevisiae to high temperatures are scarce  <cit> , and to our knowledge there are no reports on how s. cerevisiae evolves to survive long-term exposure to a combination of heat and inhibitors.

in the present work we further characterized an evolved industrial strain, namely iso <dig>  which can grow and ferment hexose sugars under a combination of stress factors  that led to complete loss of viability for the parental industrial strain ethanol red   <cit> . with the aim of uncovering possible cellular mechanisms behind the superior phenotype of iso <dig>  the genomic sequences of er and iso <dig> were determined and compared. in addition to this, the cell wall phenotype and lipid composition of iso <dig> and er were analysed.

methods
strains and reference sequences
the industrial saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ethanol red   and the derived evolved strain iso <dig>  <cit>  were used for the experiments. cells from - <dig> °c glycerol stocks were maintained in ypd plates . the genome of the s. cerevisiae s288c strain  <cit>  was used as a reference sequence during the analysis of the er and iso <dig> next generation sequencing data. the r64-1- <dig> release of the s288c genome was downloaded from the saccharomyces genome database   <cit>  and an alternatively formatted version of this release, saccer <dig>  was downloaded from the ucsc genome browser   <cit> .

genome sequencing, variant calling and variant analysis
dna isolation
a single colony of ethanol red or iso <dig> was used to inoculate  <dig> ml of ypd in a  <dig> ml conical tube. the overnight culture was centrifuged  for  <dig> min, washed with  <dig> ml deionized water and pelleted. the cell pellet was resuspended in  <dig>  ml lysis buffer . the suspension was transferred to a ready-to-use  <dig> ml tube containing  <dig> μm beads and  <dig>  ml phenol/chloroform  was added. a precellys  <dig>  connected to a temperature controller working with dry-ice  was used for lysis . the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged  for  <dig> min., and the aqueous phase was transferred to a  <dig>  ml microcentrifuge tube.  <dig> μl chloroform was added to the tube and was mixed and centrifuged  for  <dig> min. the upper layer was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and  <dig> volume of isopropanol was used to precipitate dna by centrifugation  for  <dig> min. the isopropanol was decanted and the pellet was washed with  <dig> ml  <dig> % ethanol, followed by centrifugation  for  <dig> min. the ethanol was decanted and the pellet was allowed to dry for 30- <dig> min. the dna pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl te/rnaase, incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min and stored at - <dig> °c.

sequencing, assembly and variant calling
the sequencing of er and iso <dig> was performed by genewiz inc.  using illumina miseq 2x250bp . the de novo assembly of er and iso <dig> and the reference mapping and variant calling of both strains relative to s288c were performed by genewiz inc. using the clc genomics server . the assemblies and raw reads were deposited online, see availability of supporting data. the variant calling was performed with the following thresholds: minimum coverage  = 10×; minimum count of a variant = 4; minimum frequency  =  <dig>  %. sequence variants that did not satisfy these criteria were discarded.

analysis of the detected variants
in order to identify the variants that were unique to either er or iso <dig>  all variants that were common to both strains were disregarded according to the reference mapping results. this filtering was provided by genewiz inc. to further predict the protein-level effects of the unique variants, the positions of the coding region snps and indels in both er and iso <dig> were reformatted from their mapped position in s288c orfs to their corresponding chromosomal coordinates with a custom perl  script. the variants were then analysed for their non-synonymous effect on s288c orfs using the variant annotation integrator tool at the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . a list of the affected orf of every detected non-synonymous variant in iso <dig> was compiled and was analysed for enrichment in gene ontology  terms by the yeastmine tool at sgd . complementary go analyses were performed with the amigo  <dig> database  <cit> .

the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate   <cit>  was calculated between the er and iso <dig> strains. every snp was extracted from the variant calling dataset by a custom perl script, and was then applied to the sequences of the corresponding s288c orfs with vcftools   <cit> . the ka/ks ratio was calculated on the modelled er and iso <dig> orfs using the ma model of the kaks_calculator   <cit> . the results were quality filtered to only regard values in the range of  <dig>  < ka/ks < <dig>  it should be stressed that the ka/ks model only accounts for polymorphisms and cannot accurately assess sequences that have changed in length during the evolutionary timeframe; therefore the indels were not considered for this analysis.

non-reference material in the de novo assembled contigs were detected with the abacas software   <cit>  coupled to the nucmer portion of mummer   <cit> . the unmapped contigs from both strains were aligned with each other with blat   <cit>  in order to detect non-reference sequences that were present in both assemblies. the contigs were blasted to the ncbi database  to find regions with similarities to non-reference s. cerevisiae strains.

copy number variation was assessed for both the reference material and non-reference material. the er and iso <dig> reads were aligned to the reference genome and to the unmapped contigs with bwa   <cit> , were compressed and sorted with samtools   <cit>  and were finally analyzed for variation in copy number with cnv-seq   <cit>  and r   <cit> . for cnv-seq, the genome size parameter was set according to the size of the reference data.

lipidomics
cell cultivations for lipid analysis
cells samples for analysis of lipids were obtained from aerobic continuous cultures. inoculum was prepared by growing the cells overnight in  <dig> ml shake flasks containing  <dig> ml defined mineral medium  <cit>  buffered with phthalate buffer . after centrifugation and a washing step with deionized water, the pellet was resuspended with  <dig> ml of defined mineral medium and used for inoculation of the bioreactor. chemostat cultivations were carried out at  <dig> °c in  <dig>  l multifors bioreactors  with a working volume of  <dig> ml. aerobic conditions were maintained with an air flow rate of  <dig> vvm and stirring at  <dig> rpm. the ph was controlled at  <dig>  by addition of 3m koh. defined mineral medium with  <dig> g. l− <dig> glucose was fed at the end of the batch phase with a dilution rate of  <dig>  h− <dig>  carbon dioxide in the exhaust gas was measured with a  <dig> fermentation monitor . steady state conditions were obtained after five volume changes . samples for biomass determination and high performance liquid chromatography  analysis were obtained from  <dig> independent steady states, four of which were independent biological replicates.

quenching of the samples was achieved by quickly adding  <dig> ml of cell culture to  <dig> ml cold methanol  in pre-cooled  <dig> ml conical tubes. after immediate mixing, the cells were cooled in a dry ice-ethanol bath for maximum  <dig> s and harvested in a pre-cooled centrifuge  for  <dig> min. the supernatant was discarded and residual medium was removed with a pipette while working over dry ice-ethanol bath. a second washing of the pellet was done with  <dig> ml cold-buffered methanol . the cells were collected as before and the samples free of residual medium were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - <dig> °c.

cell dry weight determinations were performed at each steady state by triplicate measurements. for this,  <dig> ml of the culture were filtered through pre-weighted nitrocellulose filters  washed with distilled water and dried for  <dig> min in a microwave . quantification of extracellular substrates and products was done with waters hplc system . an aminex hpx-87h ion exchange column  was used for separation and a refractive index detector  was used for detection. 5mm h2so <dig> was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml.min− <dig> and the column temperature was  <dig> °c.

samples of the continuous cultures were also used to inoculate  <dig> ml shake flasks containing  <dig> ml of spruce hydrolysate  diluted to  <dig> %  with mineral medium  <cit> , and incubated at  <dig> °c. evaluation of growth under these conditions was carried out by optical density measurements at  <dig> nm  as previously described  <cit> .

extraction and quantification of lipids
extraction and lipid quantification were carried out at metabolomic discoveries gmbh . for lipid extraction  <dig> mg of quenched cells were mixed with chilled 1: <dig> : <dig> water:methanol:chloroform. additionally, cells were mechanically disrupted in a ball mill. cellular debris was removed by centrifugation.  <dig> ml of supernatant was mixed with  <dig> μl water. after phase separation, the lower non-polar phase was evaporated and resuspended in methanol. the lc separation was performed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography with accucore hilic , operated by an agilent  <dig> uplc system . the lc mobile phase was a) acetonitrile and b)  <dig>  %  formic acid in water with the following gradient:  <dig> to  <dig> min increase of b) from  <dig> % to  <dig> %,  <dig> to  <dig> min increase to  <dig> % and flush for  <dig> min, subsequently equilibrate. the flow rate was  <dig> μl.min− <dig>  injection volume  <dig> μl. the mass spectrometry was performed using a  <dig> qtof/ms detector  with electrospray ionization. the measured metabolite concentration was normalized to internal standards.

due to the small lipid phase obtained in two of the biomass samples of er, the analysis of the lipid content for this strain was done only with four samples. in the case of iso <dig>  one of the samples was identified as an outlier and excluded from the study; therefore the analysis of the lipid content of this strain was done with five samples. significant changes of metabolites were analysed considering variance homogeneity and p-values below  <dig>  were considered as significant. the difference in the concentration of the lipid species is reported as log2-ratio of er/iso <dig> 

physiological characterisation
growth on non-fermentable carbohydrates
mitochondrial function was evaluated by growth on glycerol and ethanol as sole carbon sources  <cit> . for this, ypd-grown cells of er and iso <dig> were used to inoculate ynb medium supplemented with  <dig> %  ethanol as carbon source or were diluted with deionized water and plated on ypg plates  glycerol,  <dig> g.l− <dig> agar) and incubated at  <dig> °c for 48h. ypdg plates  glycerol,  <dig> g.l− <dig> agar) were used to determine the proportion of petite mutants that lacked or had defective mitochondrial dna . growth on ypd plates was set as control conditions.

RESULTS
characterisation of the genome-level effect of the iso12-adaptation
genome sequencing, assembly and variant calling
the genomes of the ethanol red  and iso <dig> yeast strains were sequenced using the illumina next generation sequencing  platform. this resulted in 15m and 12m reads for er and iso <dig> , both displaying a median phred score of  <dig> . the reads were mapped to the s. cerevisiae s288c reference genome  and the sequence variants relative to the reference strain were detected for both strains. furthermore, the reads were also used to de novo assemble the genomic sequences of er and iso <dig> in order to assess the effect of the adaptation in genomic material not found in the reference strain. the er assembly resulted in  <dig> contigs  consisting of a total of  <dig>  mbp . for iso <dig>   <dig> contigs were assembled  with a total size of  <dig>  mbp . a summary of the sequencing, reference mapping and de novo assembly results is found in table  <dig> table  <dig> sequencing, reference mapping and de novo assembly results 


reference mapping to the s288c reference sequence

de novo
assembly


the variant calling was set to identify two types of variations - snps  and indels  - and resulted in  <dig>   and  <dig>   variants relative to s288c , using the minimum thresholds of detection stated in the materials and methods section. this was an expected magnitude, similar to a previous study that also mapped a diploid strain to s288c  <cit> , and it reflected the marked differences between the genomes of different strains in general, and between the genomes of laboratory and industrial strains in particular  <cit> . since the adapted strain was derived from er by laboratory adaptive evolution  <cit> , a high number of the identified variants versus s288c  were found to be common to both strains. these snps and indels were disregarded, and further analyses focused on the remaining  <dig>  variants that were found only in er and  <dig>  variants that were unique to iso <dig> table  <dig> results of the variant calling and -analysis

predicted effects of the coding region variantsa

aincluding overlapping orfs



since only around  <dig> generations separated iso <dig> from its parental strain, the number of identified variants suggested a higher mutation rate per genome than previously reported  <cit> . one possible reason may be an underestimation of the number of generations for iso <dig>  since the decrease in the number of viable cells due to the cytotoxic effects of hydrolysate and temperature was not taken into consideration every time a new batch was inoculated  <cit> . also, the number of alterations reported in other evolutionary experiments using s. cerevisiae shows significant differences. for example, the number of mutations reported for s. cerevisiae cen.pk113-7d after over  <dig> generations growing at high temperature  was of only  <dig> snps distributed in  <dig> genes  <cit> , while a total of  <dig> alterations were reported for s288c after approximately  <dig> generations during serial transfers with increasing concentrations of barley hydrolysate  <cit> . these results suggest that the mutation rate will be affected by the genomic stability of the background strain as well as by the type of stress encountered during the evolutionary experiment. therefore, apart from a probable higher natural mutation rate in er compared to the aforementioned strains, it is very likely that the stressful environment - given by the combination of high temperature and toxic hydrolysate-derived compounds- significantly increased the rates of random mutagenesis; an effect referred as “stress-inducible mutability” that has been discussed in previous studies  <cit> . also, the diploid nature of these strains possibly allows for a greater accumulation of mutants than a haploid strain would  <cit>  because undesired mutations would not be selected against and could thus be inherited and add to the accumulation of mutations as long as one functional wild type allele remains in the genome. finally, an inevitable possibility when working with ngs data is that of erroneous data interpretation due to sequencing error. for illumina data, a number of technical difficulties on the sequencing-level have been proposed to increase the false snp call rate, including under-representation of gc-rich regions during the pcr-amplification step  <cit>  and strand bias  during read mapping  <cit> . in the end, we cannot rule out that phenomena like these might have affected the false positive count in the dataset. it should be mentioned that we, in addition to the reference-mapping approach, also attempted variant calling by mapping iso <dig> reads to the er de novo assembly. however, this resulted in an even higher number of variants between the two strains, which might be due to a high rate of false positive variant calls. we thus believe that the method that is presented here  was a sound choice for this study.

analysis of the distribution and the protein-level effects of the sequence variants
the snps and indels detected in er and iso <dig> were found to be distributed throughout the extent of the s288c reference genome, albeit with varying peak density . in fact, circa  <dig> % of the detected variants in both er and iso <dig> were intergenic . since only ~ <dig> % of the s. cerevisiae genome is non-coding  <cit> , this result indicated a heavy bias towards intergenic alterations during the evolution of er into iso <dig>  many investigations have shown that variations in non-coding regions have an important impact on phenotypic diversity given their influence on gene expression level  <cit> . although the differences in intergenic regions would definitely merit further investigation, for the purpose of the current study we focused the analysis on variants within coding regions.

the variant annotation integrator web-tool  <cit>  was used to identify and classify the protein-level effects of the snps and indels. the non-synonymous mutations affecting coding regions  were distributed in the following manner:  <dig> non-synonymous snps were allocated in  <dig> orfs in er  while  <dig> non-synonymous snps were distributed among  <dig> orfs in iso <dig> . forty-eight orfs presented variants in both er and iso <dig>  while  <dig> and  <dig> orfs presented snps only in er and iso <dig> respectively. altogether, er and iso <dig> presented genetic variations in a total of  <dig> different orfs . a majority of the non-synonymous variants were classified as missense variants, i.e. changing a single amino acid but not affecting protein length or read frame . furthermore there were  <dig> variants in both strains that were predicted to generate a premature stop codon or a frame shift, and could therefore result in loss of protein function .

to investigate the  <dig> genes that were predicted to have gained non-synonymous alterations, we applied a number of complementary analyses. a smaller number of candidate genes with high relevance to the novel phenotype of iso <dig> was identified by assessing functional annotation enrichment and haplotype variation , as well as by modelling of the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio  and copy number variation . these approaches are elaborated in the following sections.

enrichment in cell periphery-related proteins
the  <dig> orfs that differed between the strains were first investigated-independently from ploidy, substitution ratio and cnv-for their enrichment in gene ontology  terms using sgd  in order to infer cellular functions and structures that were overrepresented . by default, the tool at sgd assesses go enrichment in three different categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function.fig.  <dig> significantly enriched gene ontology  terms for the non-synonymous variants detected in iso <dig> compared to er . terms were sorted in three categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. the enrichment analysis was performed using the yeastmine at saccharomyces genome database . note that the same orf can figure in multiple bars; please refer to additional file  <dig> for the full list of orfs



in the biological process ontology, transposition, rna mediated  and interspecies interaction between organisms  were the most significantly enriched terms .  <dig> different orfs were represented in the  <dig> enriched terms obtained within the category biological process . of these  <dig>   <dig> were directed related with transposition-associated processes  while the remaining  <dig> orfs were associated with cellular processes such as flocculation , agglutination, conjugation and fusion .

with respect to the cellular component category, the enrichments revealed that around  <dig> % of the orfs differing between er and iso <dig> encoded proteins related with structural components of the cell such as the cell wall and the plasma membrane and with the assembly and organization of the cytoskeleton . the two most enriched terms in this category corresponded to the retrotransposon nucleocapsid  and cell periphery ; in fact, the cell periphery category was the go term that was enriched in the highest number of orfs . some of the molecular functions covered by the cell wall-associated orfs included heat shock protein , transcription factor  and components of the cell wall integrity signalling pathway . sequence variations were also found in orfs coding for various glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored cell wall proteins . moreover, er and iso <dig> differed in the genomic sequence of several orfs coding for proteins involved in cellular surface properties such as adhesion , and biofilm and flocculation  . snps related to membrane proteins included orfs coding for various type of transporters such as the abc-transporter pdr <dig>  the multidrug efflux transporter atr <dig>  the iron transporter ftr <dig> and the proton-gluthatione transporter gex <dig>  among others. notably,  <dig> of the at least  <dig> hexose transporters present in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  presented genomic differences between the strains . also, gene variations were found in orfs whose transcription products are associated with the sensing and reception of nutritional signals  and oxidative stress . finally, the genomic variations identified in sequences coding for proteins involved in the assembly and organization of the cytoskeleton included snps in abp <dig>  sla <dig>  num <dig>  bem <dig> .

it is well established that cell wall and membranes are highly dynamic structures that respond to various forms of environmental stress . heat in particular has been shown to reduce membrane potential and disrupt the membrane integrity, affecting its permeability and fluidity  <cit> . the enrichments of genes directly related with cell wall and membrane indicate therefore that such structures were important targets during the evolutionary experiment. although some genomic variations may be associated with the deleterious effect of the stressors over these cellular components, the direct relationship of some of the aforementioned proteins  with the stress tolerance response in yeasts  <cit> , suggest that variations in the regulation, structure and/or activity of these protein variants as a result of the point mutations and other genomic alterations, were necessary for the cell to adapt to the severe conditions. in fact, iso <dig> exhibited an improved viability during 48h-cultivation in undiluted spruce hydrolysate while only little or no reduction of inhibitors was observed . we hypothesise that this results from changes in membrane permeability that were induced by long-term exposure to stressors. similarly, the already reported negative effects of high temperature and furfural over cytoskeleton elements and consequently over their physiological functions - including vesicular transport- may explain the alterations in more than  <dig> orfs related with the cellular matrix . actually, according to the amigo  <dig> database  <cit> ,  <dig> orfs associated with vesicle-mediated transport presented genetic variations between the strains, e.g. sec <dig>  spo <dig> and sed <dig> . however, bearing in mind that iso <dig> is indeed capable of growing and fermenting under the combination of the stresses, the results suggest that either such alterations were phenotypically neutral or that at least some of the new variants of the actin-related proteins in iso <dig> would contribute to the adaptation response, among other, by allowing the cell to carry on with crucial intracellular traffic of proteins.

the enrichment of genes in the third go category, molecular function covers different types of proteases. of particular relevance are the orfs coding for proteasome sub-units and ubiquitin-specific proteases that are present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm  . recently it was demonstrated that a single mutation in the ubiquitin-specific protease gene upb <dig> was directly correlated with tolerance to spent sulphite liquor, a raw material for ethanol production with similar type of inhibitors as spruce hydrolysate  <cit> . similarly, other studies have established the effect of mutations in different proteases on the response of the cell to different environmental effectors  <cit> . the snps identified in iso <dig> emphasize hence the relevance of the ubiquitin-mediated protein homeostasis machinery during heat and inhibitor stresses. the most enrichment terms in this ontology corresponded to aspartic-type endopeptidase activity  and rna-dna hybrid ribonuclease activity .

the enrichment of transposition-related orfs in all the three categories of the gene ontology database suggest that changes in the dna sequences of retrotransposons are a constant feature behind the genetic differences between er and iso <dig>  on the one hand, retrotransposons  have been clearly identified as responsible entities for evolutionary genomic and phenotypic changes in s. cerevisiae strains by causing gene disruption, promoting chromosomal rearrangements or acting as regulatory agents  <cit> . on the other hand, the results obtained in the current study do not provide information about the transpositional activity of the ty elements, and therefore it is not possible to establish a direct relationship between the high numbers of go enrichments for ty elements related events with phenotypic differences between the strains. yet, considering the diversity of variants in the ty coding regions , we speculate that at least some of such snps may be responsible for a higher rate of replication of the transposon and/or for providing an adaptive advantage to iso <dig> under the stress conditions.

eleven genes were found to be under positive selection in iso12
the go analysis revealed that the dataset with the orfs with snps/indels were enriched in terms related to cell-periphery proteins. next, we investigated each gene in this dataset by looking at which orfs that were considered likely to be evolved under positive selection, i.e. a directional selection driven by change in phenotype  <cit> . the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio   <cit>  was calculated between the two strains based on the effect the snps would have on a s288c background .  <dig> genes were found to be under positive selection . although go enrichment analysis is not applicable on this small dataset, a relationship similar to that of the above go enrichment analysis was found. the proteins linked with these eleven orfs were found in different locations within the cell; mtl <dig> , hxt <dig> , cyc <dig>  and sed <dig>  code for proteins associated with membranes; flo <dig>  and flo <dig>  are linked to the cell wall and srp <dig>  with the nucleus. the four other orfs are associated with proteins of unknown/uncharacterized location and function. it can be noted that srp <dig> and the four putative orfs did not show up during the go enrichment analysis while the other orfs did . however, it should be kept in mind that the enrichment assessment only takes functional annotations and not the number of mutations into consideration, and in that sense ka/ks-modelling complements the enrichment analysis.

the implications of the stress-membrane sensor mtl1p  <cit>  as part of the cellular response to oxidative stress are physiologically coherent with the conditions of the evolutionary experiment  <cit> . mtl <dig> is a partly redundant paralog of the major cell wall integrity  sensor mid <dig> and is involved in the oxidative stress response and actin cytoskeleton repolarisation  <cit>  and has also been named a putative sensor for glucose starvation  <cit> . furfural - one of the stressors that were present during the iso <dig> adaptation - has been reported to cause accumulation of reactive oxygen species  that, among others, damages the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae the cwi pathway functions by a mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade that leads to the activation of transcription factors controlling the expression of genes responsible for adjusting cell wall structure and composition according to the environmental input, and mtl <dig> is one of the sensors that can initiate the cascade in response to cell wall stress  <cit> . the apparent positive selection of mtl <dig> is thus highly interesting, and since the identified variants in this orf were solely missense variants and not loss-of-function variants  we hypothesize that the cwi sensing in the adapted strain might have undergone functional alterations. however, when the cwi of er and iso <dig> were evaluated experimentally with an enzymatic cell wall lysis assay  no significant differences in maximal lysis rate were observed . from this it was concluded that there had been no changes in β  <dig> -glucan integrity, which however does not rule out other changes to the cwi system. in fact, it has been reported that β- <dig> -glucanase  is sensed with combined signalling of the high osmolarity/glycerol pathway and the cwi, but that upstream cwi elements such as mtl1 does not contribute to the response  <cit> . this could explain why the detected alterations in mtl <dig> were not reflected in the results of the lyticase assay.

the flo  genes also stand out as important targets during the evolution. first, mutations in the flo <dig> and flo <dig> orfs appeared to have evolved under positive selection . second, the sequence regions coding for the flocculation-related genes flo <dig> and flo <dig> showed homozygous snps in both strains , and finally around  <dig> snps between the strains were found in the genome sequence of flo <dig>  this means that  <dig> out of the  <dig> flo genes present in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  differed between strains. it is known that changes in sequence, copy number transcriptional level and other regulatory mechanisms of the flo genes affect several of the adaptive mechanisms of the cells towards detrimental environmental factors including flocculation, biofilm formation and agar invasion . in fact, previous studies have shown direct evidence of the role of flo genes on the adaptation capacity of yeast cells to overcome temperature or lignocellulosic-derived inhibitors  <cit> . the genotypic variations between iso <dig> and er in the flo genes correlated with a higher capacity in iso <dig> to form biofilms , invade agar and form novel colony morphologies under certain conditions . it seems therefore very reasonable that the acquired properties of iso <dig> cells to aggregate, mediated by at least some of the flo genes variations, are part of the cellular adaptive mechanisms to resist the combination of both stresses.

other genes predicted to have evolved under positive selective pressure were cyc <dig> and hxt <dig> . cyc <dig> is a nuclear gene that codes for cytochrome c heme lyase. cyc <dig> null mutants are respiratory deficient since they lack a functional cytochrome c, and their ros levels have been found to be lower than wild-type strains  <cit> . although the missense variant present in iso <dig>  is most probably functionally active, the effect of such amino acid change on the decreased respiratory capacity of iso <dig>  cannot be discarded  <cit> . in relation to hxt <dig>  it has been proposed that down-regulation of hexose transporters as a mechanism to reduce growth could be part of the cellular response during heat-shock  <cit> . hxt <dig> is not considered a main yeast hexose transporter  <cit>  and the impact of the changes to hxt <dig> is in itself not very evident, however, other hexose transporters did exhibit mutations in iso <dig>  including a frameshift indel in hxt <dig> .

the significance of the other six genes that appeared to have evolved under positive selection is less clear.

haplotype- and copy number variations indicate possible gene dosage effects in iso12
an increase in the relative content of heterozygous variants was observed in the datasets of both strains after subtraction of the common variants. approximately  <dig> % of the total snps/indels were classified as heterozygous in both original datasets. this changed to  <dig> % in the er dataset and to  <dig> % for iso <dig> after the shared variants were disregarded. due to the polyploid nature of the strains, the high content of heterozygous variants in the datasets implies that the possible novel effects of many of the strain-unique variants in iso <dig> might be overshadowed by parallel wild-type alleles. on the other hand, heterozygous variants can also confer haploinsufficiency in yeast  <cit>   and thus haplotype variations remain relevant to the iso <dig> case.

it was found that loss-of-function variants such as premature stop codons and frame shifts were almost exclusively heterozygous in both strains, with no homozygous calls in iso <dig> and seven in er. it is nevertheless possible that the predicted novel stops in  <dig> genes in the adapted strain  is contributing to the phenotype by gene dosage effects. an intriguing example in the present study is the premature stop in the external glucose sensor gpr <dig> . gpr1p belongs to the ras-camp-pka pathway and constitutes the means of which this pathway reacts to extracellular glucose  <cit> . down-regulation of the ras-camp-pka pathway has been associated to decreased heat sensitivity  <cit>  – a prominent phenotype in iso12- as decreased protein kinase a  levels induces transcription of a number of stress response genes with stress response elements  in their promoter regions  <cit> . the premature stop codon in gpr1p was predicted in amino acid  <dig> of  <dig> that, in addition to the deprivation of three quarters of the protein, implicates a complete loss of the cytoplasmic tail  <cit>  which is highly likely to cause a disruption in the signal transmission. however, to fully elucidate this, camp/pka levels would have to be measured and compared between the adapted and the parental strain.

gene dosage effects can furthermore affect phenotype not only by changes in haplotype but also by copy number variation . cnvs are, in addition to snps and indels, a common genomic evolutionary effect and have been observed both in laboratory adaptation experiments  <cit>  and in natural isolates and industrial yeast strains  <cit> . we used a reference mapping-based method  <cit>  to assess the changes in copy number between er and iso <dig> and detected  <dig> regions with a >2-fold higher cnv and  <dig> regions with a >2-fold decrease in iso <dig> . as  <dig> % of the cnv-regions were located either in telomere or transposon regions, they are likely to be false cnv-calls as centromeric and telomeric regions are known to be highly difficult to sequence and assemble/reference-map due to their enrichment of tandem repeats  <cit> . when a log <dig> threshold was applied,  <dig> of the cnv-regions were found to correspond to orfs , including a two-fold increase in flo <dig>  and ena <dig>  . three orfs exhibited a cnv higher than three-fold: ena <dig> had increased from er to iso <dig> , and two orfs, pho <dig>  and flo <dig> , had decreased.

sequencing of pho <dig> has been previously been proven problematic due to the presence of paralogs  <cit>  and for this reason we cannot rule out the possibility that pho <dig> is subject of a false cnv-call. but the cnvs in the flo genes matched the above results regarding positive selection pressure and bring additional evidence to support the correlation of alterations in this gene family and the phenotype of iso <dig> . as for ena <dig> and ena <dig>  they encode atpase sodium pumps  <cit> , and results presented by gilbert et al. showed that an increased copy number of ena <dig>  ena <dig> and ena <dig> genes in two different lines of mutants strains obtained after evolution under increased concentrations of acetate, was associated to improved acetate and temperature robustness  <cit> . the similarity on the cnvs in the ena genes in iso <dig>  whose adaptation was also carried out in the presence of acetic acid and at elevated temperature, supports a relationship between the function of the ena genes and these two types of stressors and suggest that such genes have a tendency to cnvs as a common stress response in yeast.

assessment of the non-reference genomic material through de novo assemblies
industrial yeast strains often contain genomic material that is not shared with the s288c reference strain due to differences in their lineage  <cit> . these variations in genome content can confer important strain-specific geno- and phenotypes and assessment of such regions will add to the larger picture of evolutionary effects. again, we focused on investigating the changes between the parental and adapted strain. by mapping the contigs from the de novo assemblies to the reference genome, we found  <dig> contigs in er and  <dig> in iso <dig> that could not be mapped to the reference . alignment of the unmapped contigs with each other revealed that there were five alignment pairs that were present in both strains; in total,  <dig> kb were successfully aligned . the top blastx-results showed  that there were regions in these contigs with high similarities to protein-coding regions from non-s288c strains, including the wine strain awri <dig>  the industrial bioethanol strain-derivative jay <dig> and the sake brewing yeast kyokai no.  <dig> 

in contrast with the cnv-analysis of the reference-material, the majority of the cnvs detected in these contigs were higher in iso <dig> than in er: in total,  <dig> regions with >2-fold cnv was detected in these five pairs, of which  <dig> were higher in iso <dig> . the largest contigs in terms of size  did also contain the highest density of cnv-regions. using blastx, we could identify that a two-fold increase for iso <dig> in a region corresponding to adh <dig> from the yjm <dig> strain , and a 2-fold decrease in iso <dig> in the loci with similarity to aad <dig> from strain awri <dig>  and uip <dig> from jay <dig> . these genes are present also in s288c, however, the results of the blast search resulted in higher identities with the non-reference strains, which suggests that the lateral sequences were different. when blasted towards sgd, er contig  <dig> displayed high identity to mitochondrial material from non-s288c s.cerevisiae strains; however, none of the cnv-regions matched any annotated orfs from the database.

the proposed increase in cnv for adh <dig> is especially intriguing in the context of the novel iso <dig> phenotype. increased adh <dig> activity has previously been positively correlated with hmf tolerance; upregulation of this gene has been observed in hmf tolerant yeast strains  <cit>  and overexpression of adh <dig> has been shown to result in a significant increase in hmf reduction capacity with nadh as cofactor and also improved cell growth recovery in hmf  <cit> . however, this is a surprising find in relation to the actual iso <dig> phenotype as the hmf-reduction capacity in this strain was found to be lower than in er  <cit> .

lipidome comparison
lipids play a key role on the biological functionality of membranes, by providing a permeable barrier and by maintaining its liquid crystalline state  <cit> . the effects of environmental stressors on cellular membranes have been extensively studied due to the essential role of these structures for proper functioning of the cell. in general, the consequences of environmental conditions on membranes are described by perturbations of the membrane fluidity, i.e. alterations on membrane composition and organization that not only affect the permeability of the barrier , but also disrupt the functionality of many membrane-associated proteins , and influence the expression of many genes   <cit> . lipids are of primary relevance for membrane functionality at high temperatures; in fact, it has been suggested that the reason why there are no known extreme eukaryotic thermophile can be attributed not only to their susceptibility to mrna degradation, but also to the susceptibility of their lipids to changes in permeability and phase-state when exposed to high temperatures  <cit> .

alterations in lipid-membrane composition are known to take place as a response to changes in temperature and chemical stressors . based on the above, and in parallel to the genomic analysis, the differences in lipid composition between er and iso <dig> were analysed by a relative quantitative approach . the lipidomes of the two strains reflected important differences in more than one lipid species . nine out of  <dig> analysed lipid species were found in relative higher concentration in iso <dig> with all lipid classes represented by at least by one metabolite . the raw data of the lipid analysis from all the samples and the differential analysis are available in additional file  <dig>  although the relevance of the particular lipids is difficult to assess, it is pertinent to note that accumulation of cerotic acid has been reported as part of a mechanism of cell resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> . considering that during the evolutionary process both heat and some of the hydrolysate-derived inhibitors were a source of reactive oxygen species   <cit> , alterations in the content of cerotic acid may account, at least in part, for the increased resistance in iso <dig>  there was no significant difference in the concentration of ergosterol between both strains, but a higher concentration of ergosta- <dig> , <dig> -tetraene-3beta-ol –the direct precursor of ergosterol– was found in iso <dig>  changes in sterol composition have been found to be associated with higher thermotolerance in yeasts  <cit> . considering that in terms of biological functionality ergosta- <dig> , <dig> -tetraene-3beta-ol and ergosterol are very similar under normal conditions  <cit> , the increase of ergosta- <dig> , <dig> -tetraene-3beta-ol in iso <dig> may be linked to the adaptive mechanisms developed by the cells to survive the high temperature. similar changes in lipid composition are also likely to confer the improved cell viability in undiluted spruce hydrolysate of iso <dig>  that was found to be unrelated to inhibitor detoxification .table  <dig> significantly enriched lipids in iso <dig> compared to er



the lipidomic results prompted us to look at the genomic differences associated with lipid metabolism. by matching the  <dig> orfs recognized under the category lipid metabolic process  with the  <dig> orfs differing between the strains,  <dig> orfs were identified . the non-synonymous variants were identified in genes related with biosynthesis, regulation and modification of the main lipid classes fatty acid , glycerophospholipid , sphingolipid  and sterol  but it was not possible to directly correlate the effect of the genetic variations and the pathways associated with the metabolism of the altered lipid species. nevertheless, both types of evidence point towards an essential readjustment in the membranes of the evolved strain. such rearrangement in the metabolism of lipids in iso <dig> would be a coherent response towards both heat and hydrolysate-derived inhibitors during the long-term adaptation process, suggesting that at least some of the alterations in lipid composition could be essential for proper membrane development and function. the distinctions in lipid-related orfs and lipid composition could also be connected with other biological functions of lipids related to stress response such as their role as signaling molecules during heat stress  <cit> , their involvement during the initiation of translation of heat shock proteins  <cit>  and exocytosis, a process that also largely depends on lipid-related reactions  <cit>  and is largely affected during cellular stress  <cit> .

physiological characterisation of iso12
growth on non-fermentable substrates and multicellularity
it has been established that in s. cerevisiae, the main targets of thermal death are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane  <cit>  and that a loss of mitochondrial genes as well as the development of a mitochondria-defective  phenotype are common effects of heat stress on yeasts  <cit> . growth evaluation of iso <dig> and its parental strain er was performed on media containing ethanol or glycerol as sole carbon sources since petite cells cannot grow in non-fermentable substrates  <cit> . in ethanol, the biomass of iso <dig> increased  <dig> times during the first  <dig> h , while the biomass of er increased around  <dig> times . growth was also observed on glycerol plates for the evolved strain . the proportion of rho− cells  could not be determined for any of the strains since there was no difference in colony size compared with the ypdg plates. therefore, although iso <dig> did not present a true petite phenotype, the reduced growth rate in ethanol and the slower growth under mild conditions previously reported  <cit>  hinted towards the presence of alteration within the respiratory chain  <cit> . the correlates to the changes in cytochrome c heme lyase , that was one of the  <dig> genes whose evolution was predicted to have occurred under positive selective pressure . as discussed above, changes to this gene have been related to respiratory deficiencies at the benefit of decreased ros levels  <cit>  which are two relevant aspects with respect to the iso <dig> phenotype.fig.  <dig> colony morphology of er ) and iso <dig>  when grown on glucose  and glycerol c and d. for growth on glucose the picture shows the bottom of the colony, while the surface is presented for growth on glycerol



additionally, the evaluation of growth on plates revealed a phenotype that has been denoted as “colony morphology response” and that is used to describe colonies with complex and organized structures  <cit> . this phenotype was observed for iso <dig> only  and the specific pattern was dependent on the carbon source. for instance, a characteristic “y” shaped agar invasion was observed on the bottom of the glucose plates . on glycerol, agar invasion was not perceived, but the surface of the colony had a regular and complex pattern . the formation of biofilm after long-term cultivations was also a phenotype observed only in iso <dig> strain . as mentioned previously, agar invasion and biofilm formation have been reported as a response to different environmental stresses . the complexity of the morphological response can be explained by the multiple and interacting signalling pathways. for instance, the filamentous growth mapk cascade and the ras-camp-pka pathway  have been shown to be the two key signalling pathways behind the colony morphology response  <cit> . however, other signalling networks such as the target of rapamycin  pathway  <cit>  and cell wall integrity  pathway take also part in the regulation  <cit> . indeed, the transcription of at least flo <dig>  is regulated by the mapk and camp signalling pathways  <cit>  and changes in the expression levels of this gene strongly affect colony morphology  <cit> . furthermore, the changes to mtl <dig> and gpr <dig> also emphasize that the mapk and ras-camp signalling in itself has been altered. based on these results we hypothesize that the presence of genetic variants in different orfs related with the aforementioned signalling pathways and possible interactions with other proteins  account for the morphological phenotypes displayed by iso <dig>  moreover, the capacity of multicellular behaviour observed in iso <dig> becomes an additional piece of evidence towards the relevance of multicellularity as an evolution strategy to improve competitiveness and tolerance to environmental stresses .

CONCLUSIONS
from the results presented in the current study, the improved tolerance to combined stresses in iso <dig> is shown to reside in multiple mechanisms requiring more than just a few mutations. the results indicate that the adaptive evolution that was used to generate iso <dig> gave rise to non-synonymous variants significantly enriched in go terms related to cell periphery-related proteins. it was also found that, besides the improved thermotolerance of iso <dig> reported in the previous study, the evolved strain has also a higher capability than er to withstand the toxic effects of high concentrations of spruce hydrolysate-derived inhibitors and that such capability is not related with furaldehyde-reduction capacity . the analysis of the lipid composition of the cells indicates that significant rearrangements in the lipidome may also account for the superior phenotype of iso <dig> under conditions of stress. membranes would be feasible and convenient targets for adaptation since the lethal effect of both types of stressors  could be counteracted by a common mechanism. thus, the iso <dig> genotype and phenotype converges to suggest that the membranes and lipidome of s. cerevisiae may play an important role during evolutionary adaptation to high temperature in the presence of hydrolysate-derived inhibitors. the key mutations, however, are difficult to pinpoint due to the high degree of strain mutability imposed by the conditions of the evolution process. based on a predictive model of genes under positive selection and on other genomic variations investigated, the genes mtl <dig>  flo1/5/9/ <dig>  cyc <dig>  gpr <dig>  adh <dig> and ena1- <dig> are strong candidates for being directly responsible for the phenotypic changes between the strains. further sequencing of different clones from the adaptation experiment displaying the improved phenotype could be done in the future to narrow the number of key mutations related with the superior phenotype. however, from an applied point of view it would seem more reasonable to attempt to replace the mutations that are responsible for negative traits accumulated in iso12: e.g. its slower growth rate and its reduced capacity for nadph-dependent reduction.
