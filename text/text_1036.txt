BACKGROUND
phosphate is needed by any living cell for structural and metabolic purposes. inorganic phosphate  has to be actively transported across the cell membrane against a chemical and electrical gradient. in mammalian cells this task is managed by the type iii sodium-dependent pi  symporters, pit <dig> and pit <dig>  which utilize the free energy provided by the na+ concentration gradient as the driving force for uphill import of pi <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> .

the mammalian type iii transporters are part of the pi transport  family , but several members were originally identified as receptors for different retroviruses belonging to the gamma-retrovirus genus  <cit> ; thus, pit <dig> and pit <dig> are proteins with dual functions. the pit family also comprises non-mammalian members, e.g., fungus pho-4+ )  <cit>  and yeast pho <dig> )  <cit>  as well as the proton -dependent pi transporters from bacteria, pita and pitb )  <cit> , and plant pht2_ <dig> )  <cit> . furthermore, there is an increasing number of entries in the national center for biotechnology information  protein database  that show similarity to the known members of the pit family and therefore are denoted putative phosphate permeases; and pit family members have been found in all kingdoms  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . altogether, this suggests that the pit proteins developed very early in evolution and that this family of proteins has important function in all kingdoms of life.

the first membrane topology model of pit proteins was based on kyte-doolittle hydropathy plots. analyses of human pit <dig> and pho-4+ protein sequences predicted  <dig> transmembrane  domains,  <dig> loops  hereof  <dig> extracellular, internal n- and c-terminal ends, and a large hydrophilic domain  intracellularly positioned between the putative 6th and 7th tm domains  <cit> . due to profound similarity  between the human pit paralogs, the same membrane topology model was proposed to also apply for human pit <dig>   <cit> . the model was, moreover, supported by the experimental assignment of the large intracellular domain of rat pit <dig> to the cytoplasmic space  <cit> . other topology models have, however, been proposed for pit <dig>  <cit>  and pit <dig>  <cit>  ; please see legend to figure  <dig> for more details. nevertheless, we have shown that exchanging as little as  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids in the fungal pit protein, pho-4+, with human pit <dig> or human pit <dig> sequences, respectively, results in proteins that support infection by human pit <dig> or pit <dig> cognate gamma-retroviruses  <cit> ; results, which suggest that these transporters are structurally highly related.

analyzing human pit <dig> and pho-4+ sequences, johann and coworkers discovered an internal sequence repeat, which they suggested had originated from an ancient gene duplication  <cit> . both regions were shown to harbor a prodom domain, pd <dig>   <cit>  , characteristic for all members of the pit family. interestingly, all amino acids in human pit <dig>  and in human pit <dig>  identified to be critical for pi transport function are located in these prodom domains   <cit> . it should be noted, that, the prodom domain pd <dig> has changed and now consists of what corresponds to human pit <dig> i53-l <dig> http://prodom.prabi.fr . in an attempt to narrow down a pit family trait, saier aligned the n-terminal protein sequences from  <dig> members representing all kingdoms  <cit> . the author noted the existence of an 11-amino-acid-long sequence in the n-terminal region containing the conserved core sequence  and proposed it to be a signature sequence for the pit family  <cit> . however, refined studies of the n- and c-termini of  <dig> protein sequences representing pit family members from all kingdoms revealed that these proteins harbor a 12-amino-acid-long pit family signature sequence - with the common core consensus sequence  - within each of the pd <dig> prodom domains proposed in  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, d <dig> and d <dig> shown to be critical for pit <dig> pi transport are placed in either of the pit family signature sequences  <cit> .

to further investigate the importance of the pit family signature sequences, we have analyzed the human pit <dig> histidine, h <dig>  located in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence, and we show that it is indeed critical for the pi transport function but dispensable for infection by pit <dig> cognate gamma-retroviruses. the human pit <dig> h <dig> is the second amino acid in this sequence to be identified as critical for pi transport function. in addition, we also show that the human pit <dig> glutamate, e <dig>  located in the pd <dig> prodom domain, is critical for the pi transport function but dispensable for infection by pit <dig> cognate gamma-retroviruses.

we have, moreover, combined studies of the gene structure of the human pit genes , alignment and tm domain prediction of protein sequences of pit family members from all kingdoms of life, and studies of the dual functions of the human pit paralogs as pi transporters and gamma-retroviral receptors, and we found that these proteins are excellent as models for studying the evolution of protein structure-function relationship. specifically based on the observation that bacterial and archaeal pit family members are substantially smaller than eukaryotic members  <cit>  and our alignment , we analyzed truncation mutants of human pit <dig>  our results clearly show that the large intracellular domain of human pit <dig> is dispensable for pi transport function, and that a fully functional pi-transporting unit can be created by the  <dig> tm domains and the small loop sequences connecting them . a further truncated human pit <dig> protein with the 5th and 6th tm domains and the large intracellular domain removed resembles the structures of as well a putative phosphate permease from archaea as of pita from bacteria  and e. coli, respectively). this mutant  was an excellent gamma-retroviral receptor  <cit> , and we here show that it can support low levels of pi transport. altogether, these results suggest that the overall structure of the pi-transporting unit of the pit family proteins has remained unchanged during evolution.

methods
sequence alignment
protein sequence alignment of nine pit family members representing all kingdoms was made using the clustalw alignment program version  <dig> . <dig> available at the european bioinformatics institute server   <cit> . the swiss-prot protein sequences were retrieved from the ncbi protein server . accession numbers are: homo sapiens  pit <dig> , h. sapiens pit <dig> , caenhorabditis elegans  putative phosphate permease , drosophila melanogaster  putative phosphate permease , n. crassa pho-4+ , trypanosoma brucei  putative phosphate permease , a. fulgidus putative phosphate permease , a. thaliana pht2_ <dig> , and e. coli pita . all sequences encompass two 12-amino-acid-long sequences, which based on comparison of  <dig> sequences, were identified in pit proteins and related proteins and suggested to be pit family signature sequences  <cit> . we, however, observed that the c-terminal pit family signature sequence of e. coli pita did not group together with the c-terminal pit family signature sequences of the eight other species in the alignment . in order to group all the c-terminal pit family signature sequences together, the alignment was adjusted manually after an alignment of h. sapiens pit <dig> amino acids s422-v <dig> , a. fulgidus putative phosphate permease , and e. coli pita . for the adjusted protein sequence alignment of the pit family members, see additional file  <dig> figure a.

prediction of tm domains in the pit family members and related proteins
putative tm domains were predicted using the tmhmm server v.  <dig>  available at the center for biological sequence analysis, technical university of denmark , and the dense alignment surface  transmembrane prediction server available at the stockholm bioinformatics center, stockholm university . tmhmm is based on a hidden markov model  that is cyclic with seven types of states for helix core, helix caps on either side, loop on the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the non-cytoplasmic side, and a globular domain state in the middle of each loop  <cit> , and das is based on low-stringency dot-plots of the query sequence against a collection of non-homologous membrane proteins using a previously derived special scoring matrix  <cit> .

in general, the predictions using both servers correspond well to each other when compared , however, the das server tends to predict shorter tm domains in agreement with the tendency for prokaryotic tm domains to be shorter in length when compared to the length of eukaryotic tm domains  <cit> . therefore, we chose to use the das server over the tmhmm server when predicting tm domains in the prokaryotic protein sequences for e. coli pita and a. fulgidus putative phosphate permease. the predicted tm domains are shown in additional file  <dig> figure a.

intron-exon border analysis of human pit genes slc20a <dig> and slc20a2
the spidey mrna-to-genome dna alignment program version  <dig>  available from the ncbi homepage   <cit>  was used to determine the location of intron-exon borders in the human pit genes. spidey takes as input an mrna sequence and the corresponding genomic sequence, and it generates an alignment that establishes the gene structure. the genbank mrna sequences were retrieved from the ncbi nucleotide server . accession numbers are: h. sapiens pit <dig> mrna  and h. sapiens pit <dig> mrna . the genomic genbank sequences were retrieved from the ncbi human genome server . accession numbers are: h. sapiens chromosome  <dig>   and h. sapiens chromosome  <dig>  . the intron-exon borders are shown in additional file  <dig> figure a on the protein sequence alignment of nine pit family members.

expression plasmids
the pcdna1artkpa-derived expression plasmids poj <dig> and poj <dig>  encoding human pit <dig> and pit <dig>  respectively, have been described  <cit> .

the plasmid encoding the human pit <dig> h502a mutant was made by using the quickchange® xl site-directed mutagenesis kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. besides the mutations creating h502a, the forward primer 5'-ttcgggtcctttgctgccggcggcaatgacgt-3' and reverse primer 5'-acgtcattgccgccggcagcaaaggacccgaa-3' also generated, by introduction of a silent mutation, an ngom iv restriction enzyme cleavage site in poj <dig>  which was used for screening. the plasmid encoding the human pit <dig> e70k mutant was made by using the altered sites ii kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. a mutation creating e70k as well as a dra i restriction enzyme cleavage site was introduced into a palter- <dig> vector  harboring the pst  <dig> - hind iii fragment of poj <dig>  using the primer 5'-gacagagcccactgttttaaagatgctagctag-3'. finally, this construct was digested with kpn i and hind iii generating a fragment, which was used to replace the corresponding fragment in poj <dig> resulting in the desired plasmid.

the plasmid encoding the human pit2Δl183-v <dig> mutant has previously been described  <cit> . the plasmid encoding the human pit2Δr254-v <dig> mutant was made using a palter- <dig> vector harboring the pst i - hind iii fragment of poj <dig>  as template in a polymerase chain reaction  with the forward primer 5'ctatagggagacccaagctttgtttatttaa3' and the reverse primer 5'gaggacctggaggaaatggaacaggaggtgtgataaagcaccttctttttg3'; the latter primer was used to create the link between the 5' sequence encoding kegals <dig> and the 3' sequence encoding h484llfh . the amplification product was digested with sse  <dig> i and hind iii and used to replace the corresponding fragment in poj <dig> resulting in the desired plasmid.

the authenticities of all the nucleotide sequences were confirmed.

the plasmids were purified using either cesium chloride  according to the protocol described by maniatis and coworkers  <cit> , or using nucleobond  or qiagen maxiprep  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

cell cultures
chinese hamster ovary k <dig> cells, cho k <dig>  and dog osteosarcoma cells, d <dig> , were cultivated as described  <cit> ; mus dunni tail fibroblasts, mdtf  were cultivated in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 100iu per ml of penicillin , and  <dig> μg of streptomycin  per ml . a-mlv , 10a <dig> mlv, and gibbon ape leukemia virus  pseudotypes of the β-galactosidase-encoding transfer vector g1bgsvn  <cit>  were obtained from the producer cell lines pa317gbn, pt67gbn, and pg13gbn, respectively  <cit> . pt67gbn was established as described  <cit> . all packaging cells were cultivated in dmem supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum  and ps . feline leukemia virus subgroup b  vector pseudotypes carrying the g1bgsvn transfer vector were made essentially as described  <cit> . vectors were harvested as supernatants from confluent producer cells, and the vector containing supernatants were filtered  and stored at -80°c.

transient transfection and infection assay
transient transfection-infection assays were performed essentially as described  <cit> . briefly, cho k <dig> cells seeded in 60-mm-diameter dishes at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per dish were transfected with  <dig> μg per dish of plasmid dna encoding human pit <dig> , human pit <dig> , human pit <dig> h502a, human pit <dig> e70k, or equimolar amounts to human pit <dig> of human pit2Δr254-v <dig> or human pit2Δl183-v <dig>  mock treated cells were transfected with empty vector dna . three independent precipitates were made per construct. forty-eight hours after transfection, approx.  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> 10a <dig> mlv or a-mlv pseudotypes carrying the g1bgsvn transfer vector were added per dish in the presence of polybrene. forty-eight hours later, the dishes were stained and evaluated. infection was analyzed by counting the number of β-galactosidase-positive  cells per dish. analyses for felv-b and galv receptor functions were performed on mdtf cells using  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells and approx.  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> vector pseudotypes per dish. numbers of vector pseudotypes used in the experiments were calculated from the number of β-galactosidase-positive colonies per ml obtained on d <dig> cells as described  <cit> .

32pi transport assay
female xenopus laevis  frogs were obtained from nasco  and kept and handled according to guidelines from the danish animal experiments inspectorate. oocytes were isolated from frogs anesthetized in a  <dig> - <dig> % ms. <dig>   solution for 10- <dig> minutes. a 1- <dig>  centimeters incision was made in the abdomen and several ovaries were removed surgically by authorized personnel. the oocytes were manually dissected and subsequently collagenase  treated and maintained in modified barth's solution  at 18°c as described  <cit> . the following day, the oocytes were used for crna injection and subsequent analyses of 32pi uptake essentially as described previously  <cit> . briefly, crnas were prepared from apa  <dig>  or bln  <dig>  linearized plasmid preparations applying the mmessage mmachine kit . stage v-vi oocytes were microinjected with  <dig>  ng of crna  and incubated at 18°c. after two to three days, the oocytes were washed in phosphate-free uptake solution , and hereafter incubated in uptake solution containing  <dig>  mm kh232po <dig>  at rt for  <dig> hour. the oocytes were washed in ice-cold uptake solution containing  <dig> mm kh2po <dig> and the 32pi uptake of each oocyte measured in a liquid scintillation counter as described previously  <cit> . it should be noted that factors coupled to the health and husbandry of the female x. laevis frogs can influence the oocyte batches. these factors include nutrition, season of the year , water temperature, salinity and hardness of the water, water contaminants or toxins, and diseases  <cit> , and the impact is that different batches of oocytes injected with crnas encoding the same proteins exhibit different average transport capacities.

statistical analysis
the null hypothesis that two mean values are identical was tested by a two-tailed student's t-test. the test compares the actual difference between two mean values in relation to the variation in the data . the null hypothesis was rejected, e.g., the mean values were considered different when p< <dig> .

RESULTS
human pit <dig> e <dig> and human pit <dig> h <dig> are critical for pi transport function but dispensable for gamma-retroviral receptor function
in a former study, we identified the putative 2nd-tm domain-positioned human pit <dig> e <dig> as being critical for pit <dig> pi transport function   <cit> . the human pit <dig> paralog, human pit <dig>  harbors a corresponding glutamate in position  <dig>  e <dig>  to investigate whether this conserved residue was important for pit <dig> pi transport function, it was mutated to a lysine generating the mutant human pit <dig> e70k. in the experiment shown in figure 3a, oocytes injected with crna encoding human pit <dig> supported a 32pi uptake of  <dig>  ± <dig>  pmol/oocyte-hour at ph  <dig>  in agreement with previous results obtained addressing the na32pi uptake function of human pit <dig> in x. laevis oocytes  <cit> . the pi transport function of human pit <dig> e70k was severely impaired when compared to that of wildtype pit <dig> ) ; see additional file  <dig> for data and statistics to figure  <dig> 

besides being pi-transporting proteins, the mammalian pit proteins also serve as gamma-retroviral receptors, and this dual-function allows for analyzing whether a mutated pit protein is properly processed, folded and translocated to the cell surface  <cit> . the human pit <dig> e70k mutant was therefore analyzed for gamma-retroviral receptor function using a transient transfection-infection assay  <cit> . for the infection assay, retroviral vectors harboring a β-galactosidase encoding transfer vector and carrying viral surface proteins responsible for receptor recognition were used; vectors carrying, e.g., 10a <dig> mlv surface proteins are referred to as 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotypes. eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding human pit <dig> and human pit <dig> e70k mutant protein were transfected into cho k <dig> cells non-permissive for infection by 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotypes   <cit> . the abilities of these proteins to support infection by 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotypes were analyzed; the infection levels were evaluated as the number of β-galactosidase positive  cells per 60-mm-diameter dish. cho k <dig> cells expressing human pit <dig> were permissive for infection by 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotypes  in agreement with pit1's well-described receptor function for 10a <dig> mlv  <cit> . moreover, the human pit <dig> e70k mutant supported wildtype pit <dig> levels of 10a <dig> mlv infection ,  <dig> ± <dig> blue cells per dish , p =  <dig> ) . besides being a receptor for 10a <dig> mlv, pit <dig> is also a receptor for galv  <cit>  and for felv-b  <cit> . the human pit <dig> e70k protein was analyzed in parallel for receptor function for vector psedotypes of these two viruses in non-permissive mus dunni tail fibroblasts and found to sustain wildtype pit <dig> infection levels of galv ,  <dig> ± <dig> blue cells per dish , p =  <dig> ) and felv-b ,  <dig> ± <dig> blue cells per dish , p =  <dig> ). the wildtype receptor functions of pit <dig> e70k confirm that the overall membrane topology is preserved and that the processing to the cell surface was unaffected by the e70k-mutation.

the glutamate e <dig> in human pit <dig> is conserved in eukaryotic pit family members as are the other two human pit <dig> residues   previously shown to be critical for pi transport function  <cit> . since the corresponding glutamate and serine residues in human pit <dig> have already been identified as being critical for pi transport function  <cit> , this demonstrate that equivalent glutamate or serine residues in the human pit paralogs both are critical for their pi transport functions. these observations illustrate that it is highly likely that the other conserved amino acids identified in human pit <dig> as being critical for pi transport function also are important for the transport function of human pit <dig> and other pit family members.

the histidine residue, human pit <dig> h <dig> is positioned in the 7th tm domain according to the johann topology model   <cit> . it is, moreover, located in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence and conserved in eukaryotic pit family members  <cit>  . moreover, analysis of  <dig> sequences of bacterial pit family members revealed only  <dig> sequences without the histidine residue illustrating that this residue is also highly preserved in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence of pit family members belonging to this kingdom  <cit>  . since the conserved aspartic acid in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence, that is human pit <dig> d <dig>  is critical for pi transport of pit <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesized that other conserved amino acids in this motif might be critically involved in pi transport function of human pit <dig> and other members of the pit family as well. mutation of human pit <dig> h <dig> to alanine created the mutant denoted pit <dig> h502a. this mutant was analyzed for 32pi transport function in x. laevis oocytes  and 10a <dig> mlv and a-mlv receptor functions in cho k <dig> cells .

in the experiment shown in figure 3b, oocytes injected with crna encoding human pit <dig> supported a 32pi uptake of  <dig>  ± <dig>  pmol/oocyte-hour at ph  <dig>  in agreement with former studies addressing the na32pi uptake function of human pit <dig> in x. laevis oocytes  <cit> . the pi transport function of human pit <dig> h502a was severely impaired when compared to that of wildtype pit <dig> ) .

to analyze whether the human pit <dig> h502a mutant is properly folded and processed to the cell surface, it was also analyzed for gamma-retroviral receptor function using the transient transfection-infection assay  <cit> . eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding human pit <dig> and human pit <dig> h502a mutant protein were transfected into cho k <dig> cells non-permissive for infection by a-mlv and 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotypes   <cit> . cho k <dig> cells expressing human pit <dig> were permissive for infection by both a-mlv and 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotypes  in agreement with pit2's well-described receptor function for a-mlv and 10a <dig> mlv  <cit> . moreover, the human pit <dig> h502a mutant supported wildtype pit <dig> levels of 10a <dig> mlv infection ,  <dig>  ± <dig> blue cells per dish , p =  <dig> )  and a-mlv infection ,  <dig>  ± <dig> blue cells per dish , p =  <dig> ) . these results demonstrate that the overall membrane topology of human pit <dig> h502a is preserved, and that the processing of human pit <dig> h502a to the membrane surface is unaffected by the mutation. thus, histidine  <dig> in the 7th tm domain is the second amino acid - besides d <dig> - in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence , which has been shown to be essential for human pit <dig> pi transport function. while the exact role of the histidine residue in the c-terminal signature sequence still needs to be revealed, its critical role for human pit <dig> pi transport function emphasizes the importance of the c-terminal pit family signature sequence in the physiological function of the pit proteins.

besides human pit <dig> e <dig> and human pit <dig> h <dig>  six conserved amino acids in human pit <dig> and two corresponding positions in human pit <dig> have previously been identified as being critical for pi transport function  <cit> . all these amino acids are located in the prodom domains  suggested in  <dig> to define members of the pit family   <cit> . therefore it is likely that sequences outside these two domains might be dispensable for the pi transport function of the pit proteins, and that a minimal pi-transporting unit of the pit proteins can be identified.

alignment of protein sequences of pit family members from all kingdoms
a previously published alignment of human pit <dig> and human pit <dig> protein sequences shows that the l <dig> loop - the large intracellular domain - is the region where these sequences diverge the most  <cit>  . moreover, alignment of human pit <dig> and n. crassa pho-4+ shows that the large intracellular domain  is smaller in pho-4+, whereas the rest of the pho-4+ protein sequence aligns well with the protein sequence of human pit <dig>  <cit>  . to further address this, we counted the number of amino acids in the large intracellular domain  of nine different pit family members and plotted the lengths according to their phylogenetic relationship in figure 4a. the figure shows that pit family members from archaea and bacteria harbor the shortest l <dig> loops whereas the pit-proteins from chordates harbor the longest l <dig> loops . note that the l <dig> loop of the c. elegans putative phosphate permease is unexpectedly short , and according to the plot we would have expected a l <dig> loop length for this protein in the interval between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids . the observed differences in the l <dig> loop lengths of pit family members from different species thus suggest that the l <dig> loop evolved from being a regular loop to become a regular domain during evolution. in order to address this issue, we counted the number of amino acids in all loops  in the nine pit family members and plotted the average loop lengths ±sem in figure 4b. the figure shows that the l <dig> loop in average is much larger than all other loops ; see additional file  <dig> for data to figure 4b. the figure also shows that the variation in the l <dig> loop lengths is substantial , see figure 4b legend for discussion. thus, with 95% confidence the longest regular loop is the l <dig> loop with a maximum length of  <dig> amino acids, see legend to figure 4b for discussion. the definition of the maximum length of a loop also has the impact that the l <dig> of e. coli pita consisting of  <dig> amino acids  has to be considered a domain. in summary, analysis of the sizes of the loop sequences l <dig> to l <dig> in nine pit family members from all kingdoms led to the determination of a limit of maximum  <dig> amino acids in a regular loop sequence - and sequences longer than  <dig> amino acids are highly likely domains. in support of our calculations of the maximum loop length for pit-proteins is a previous study of  <dig> transmembrane domain-containing sequences, with  <dig> sequences being multi-transmembrane spanning, showing that ~90% of the loops are shorter than  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . another study supporting our finding is the analysis of loops in  <dig> existing 3d structures of transmembrane proteins showing that the majority of loops connecting transmembrane domains are shorter than  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> .

the proteins in figure 4a with l <dig> loop sizes smaller than  <dig> amino acids are the archaeal putative phosphate permease and the bacterial pita protein, implying that single cell organisms without nuclei that rarely harbor membrane-bound organelles cope without the large intracellular domain, whereas single cell animals  with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles have distinct l <dig> domains as shown for the t. brucei putative phosphate permease . altogether this suggest a role for the large intracellular domain, which is not directly related to pi transport per se, and it also suggest that the large intracellular domain  may have increased in length during the evolution from archaea to chordata as a consequence of adaptation to more complex environments.

besides a difference in the lengths of l <dig>  a difference in the number of tm domains in the pit family members was observed . the illustration of tm domain conservedness  and tm domains, which are suggested by us to be present but not predicted by protein sequence analysis using the tmhmm server , shows the following conservedness of tms: tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  > tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  > tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  tm  <dig> > tm  <dig> > tm  <dig>  . the most prominent observation is that e. coli pita and a. fulgidus putative phosphate permease both lack the 5th and 6th tm domains . this in addition to the previous observation that these two proteins also lack the l <dig> domain , suggest that the 5th and 6th tm domains and the l <dig> domain are dispensable for pi transport function, and that a basic pi-transporting unit of the pit family members can be identified. this unit would consist of regions flanking the large intracellular domain  but highly likely also be devoid of the 5th and 6th tm domains. interestingly, in support of this theory, drawing of the putative topology models for human pit <dig>  e. coli pita, and a. fulgidus putative phosphate permease based on the alignment in additional file  <dig> figure a, shows that the bacterial and archaeal proteins have a predicted eight tm backbone where the n-terminal pit-family signature sequence is placed in the 1st extracellular loop  and the c-terminal pit family signature sequence is placed in the 3rd extracellular loop  . in comparison, the drawing of the putative topology model for human pit <dig> shows a backbone of  <dig> tm domains where the n-terminal and c-terminal pit-family signature sequences are placed in the 1st extracellular loop  and the 4th extracellular loop , respectively . an interpretation of these drawings could be that the intra-protein locations of the n-terminal and c-terminal pit-family signature sequences are of importance, and that tm  <dig> to tm  <dig> and tm  <dig> to tm  <dig> constitute a core sustaining the pi-transporting function whereas tm  <dig> and tm  <dig> and the large intracellular domain  constitute a regulatory unit. finally, the amino acids identified as being critical for pi transport function are located in the prodom domains suggested in  <dig>   <cit>   in agreement with the 5th and 6th tm domains and the large intracellular domain  might be dispensable for the pi transport function.

design of human pit <dig> truncation mutants
to identify the minimal pi-transporting unit, two human pit <dig> truncation mutants were analyzed. they were designed to address the pi transport function and the gamma-retroviral receptor functions of: 1) a human pit <dig> mutant protein, which consists of the  <dig> tm domains and a l <dig> loop of  <dig> amino acids  creating the mutant human pit2Δr254-v <dig>  the human pit2Δr254-v <dig> mutant does not resemble a naturally occurring homolog found in lower species, and it is merely designed to address if the large intracellular domain is dispensable for na+-dependent pi-uptake , and 2) a human pit <dig> mutant protein that resembles an archaeal and bacterial homolog with respect to protein composition, i.e., lacking the 5th and 6th tm domains and the large intracellular domain   . note that in the salaün model the 5th and 6th tm domains correspond to tmvi and tmvii .

the large intracellular domain  of human pit <dig> is dispensable for pi transport function whereas the fragment l183-v <dig> is more critical for pi transport function
the na+-dependent 32pi transport function of wildtype human pit <dig> and the human pit2-derived truncation mutants pit2Δl183-v <dig> and pit2Δr254-v <dig>  were analyzed in x. laevis oocytes .

oocytes injected with crna encoding human pit <dig> supported a 32pi uptake of  <dig>  ± <dig>  pmol/oocyte-hour  and  <dig>  ± <dig>  pmol/oocyte-hour  at ph  <dig>  in agreement with previous results  <cit> .

the 32pi transport activities of the pit <dig> mutant lacking the major part of the large intracellular domain, human pit2Δr254-v <dig>   and  <dig>  ± <dig>  pmol/oocyte-hour ) were indistinguishable from those of pit <dig>   and p =  <dig>  ); see additional file  <dig> for data and statistics to figure  <dig>  thus, the large intracellular domain of human pit <dig> but  <dig> amino acids  is dispensable for its pi transport function.

the 32pi transport activity of the human pit <dig> mutant lacking the large intracellular domain as well as the 5th and 6th tm domains, pit2Δl183-v <dig> , was severely impaired  and  <dig>  ± <dig>  pmol/oocyte-hour ) when compared to the pi transport function of wildtype pit <dig>  and p =  <dig>  ). however, interestingly the mutant did support low levels of pi uptake significantly different from h2o-injected oocytes  and  <dig>  ± <dig>  pmol/oocyte-hour )  and p =  <dig>  ).

viral receptor function of mutant pit <dig> proteins
using the transient transfection-infection assay, we analyzed whether the deletions in human pit <dig> affected their viral receptor functions for a-mlv and 10a <dig> mlv. eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding human pit <dig> and the mutant proteins were transfected into cho k <dig> cells. as expected, human pit <dig> transfected cells were permissive for infection by both 10a <dig> mlv and a-mlv vector pseudotypes . while the human pit <dig> truncation mutant lacking the large intracellular domain, human pit2Δr254-v <dig>  was a fully functional pi transporter , it only supported low levels of pit <dig> cognate gamma-retroviral infection . note that human pit2Δr254-v <dig> was tested once for a-mlv receptor function and twice for 10a <dig> mlv receptor function. the a-mlv study was done in parallel to a 10a <dig> mlv receptor function study using the same set of plasmid precipitates. interestingly, the human pit <dig> truncation mutant lacking the 5th and 6th tm domains in addition to the large intracellular domain, human pit2Δl183-v <dig> , supported substantial levels of pit <dig> cognate gamma-retroviral infection   <cit>  showing that its low levels of pi transport function were not due to incorrect processing of this mutant to the cell surface.

athe experimental setup is described in the text. a-mlv and 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotypes were tested on the same precipitates made from cscl-purified plasmids in experiment  <dig>  in experiment  <dig>  qiagen maxiprep-purified plasmids were used for preparing precipitates and only the 10a <dig> mlv vector pseudotype was tested.

breceptor and mutant receptor sequences were cloned into pcdna1artkpa.

fvalues are based on the detection limit of  <dig> blue cell per three 60-mm-diameter dishes.

pit <dig> regions directly involved in receptor function for 10a <dig> mlv and a-mlv have also been identified by expression of chimeric proteins in cho k <dig> cells and were found to be located in the putative extracellular loops  <dig>  and  <dig>    <cit> . both of the human pit <dig> mutants, pit2Δr254-v <dig> and pit2Δl183-v <dig>  harbor extracellular loops  <dig>  and  <dig>  according to the johann pit <dig> model . based on their - here identified - pi transport abilities, it is unlikely that pit2Δr254-v <dig> is less expressed at the cell surface than pit2Δl183-v <dig>  and the observation that the less truncated human pit <dig> mutant protein is a worse gamma-retroviral receptor than a more heavily truncated human pit <dig> mutant protein might instead reflect a disturbance of the folding and/or conformation of the extracellular loops  <dig>  and  <dig>  due to the sole presence of the extracellular loop  <dig>  without the large intracellular domain in pit2Δr254-v <dig> 

intron-exon borders of the human pit genes slc20a <dig> and slc20a2
the human pit proteins are encoded by genes that localize to different chromosomes. the human gene, slc20a <dig>  encoding the pit <dig> protein is located on chromosome  <dig> at position q <dig>  <cit> , and the human gene, slc20a <dig>  encoding the pit <dig> protein is located on chromosome  <dig> at position p <dig>   <cit> .

to analyze the gene structure of slc20a <dig> and slc20a <dig>  the intron-exon borders in each of the genes were determined using the spidey mrna-to-genome dna alignment as described in "methods". the intron-exon borders are marked with stars  and vertical lines in the pit <dig> and pit <dig> protein sequences in the alignment of nine pit family members in additional file  <dig> figure a.

eight out of nine intron-exon borders  in slc20a <dig> and slc20a <dig> are predicted to be homologous. one intron-exon border  and f <dig> ) are displaced giving a gap corresponding to  <dig> amino acids . these two borders are placed in the middle of the genome sequences, which encode the large intracellular domain  of the human pit proteins. as seen from additional file  <dig> figure a, the alignment between the human pit proteins in this region is poor and the gap highly likely reflects this, and not a significant difference in intron-exon structure between slc20a <dig> and slc20a <dig> 

interestingly, in support of the theory that the 5th and 6th tm domains can be dispensable for pi transport function, is the observation that these tm domains are encoded by two different exons, see additional file  <dig> figure a , and therefore the possibility exists that the sequences in these two exons have entered later in evolution.

specialized functions of the mammalian pit proteins
mammalian pit proteins are expressed in all tissues investigated and due to their broad expression profiles, they have been suggested to accommodate house-keeping functions, i.e., supplying cells with pi to maintain basic cellular functions  <cit> . however, in recent years additional specialized functions of the pit proteins have been reported. these include roles for pit <dig> in proximal tubule phosphate reabsorption  <cit> , and for pit <dig> in regulation of parathyroid gland pth production  <cit> , cell proliferation  <cit> , and in tumor necrosis factor  induced apoptosis  <cit> . recent studies also indicate that both the pit proteins function as pi sensors  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . interestingly, some of these functions, that is, pit2's suggested role in pi sensing  <cit>  and pit1's role in cell proliferation and tnf-induced apoptosis  <cit>  have been shown to be independent of the pi transport functions of the proteins.

pit <dig> has also been implicated in normal chondroblastic and osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization processes  <cit> , as well as trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells to cells with characteristics of chondro-/osteoblasts in the pathologic process of vascular calcification at hyperphosphatemia  <cit> . more rodent in vivo models have been used to study the role of pit <dig> in normal bone formation and/or embryonic development. rats with transgenic overexpression of pit <dig> showed no major bone deformity during skeletal development  <cit> . however, these rats displayed a slight but significant decrease in the bone mineral content of the whole skeleton together with a reduction albeit non-significant in the total bone area  <cit> . the role of pit <dig> during embryonic mouse development has been studied by two different groups employing early conditional excision of slc20a <dig> exons 3- <dig>  <cit>  and slc20a <dig> exon  <dig>  <cit> , which resulted in homozygous embryonic lethality. both studies find that the embryos are anemic and do not survive past e <dig> , at which stage the morphology shows reduced growth  <cit> ; the anemia was found to be due to severe defects in liver development  <cit> . comparison of wildtype mice to mice with low  expression of pit <dig> mrna showed that some of the latter mice displayed impaired bone mineralization at birth, while 15-days old mice showed no major differences in mineralization  <cit> . interestingly, in embryos  lacking

pit <dig> expression beck and coworkers found an upregulated pit <dig> expression, which however could not rescue the embryos past e <dig> , and the authors therefore suggest that the critical non-redundant role of pit <dig> in development is not pi-uptake  <cit> . altogether, the in vivo studies do not exclude a role for pit <dig> in normal bone formation, although they imply that pit <dig> is not critical for the early skeletal developmental processes.

the alignment and analyses of exon structure together with the observed pi transport functions of the pit <dig> deletion mutants presented here might suggest that the regions of the pit proteins involved in the pi-transport independent functions map to sequences in the 5th and 6th tm domains and/or in the large intracellular domain. in line with this, we are currently investigating the function of the large intracellular domain of the human pit <dig> protein and our results support the hypothesis that the large intracellular domain has other functions than pi transport.

CONCLUSIONS
investigation of the pi transport and retroviral receptor functions of the human pit proteins has allowed for identification of a histidine residue  in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence as being critically involved in pi transport function. moreover, we show that a pit <dig> glutamate residue  positioned in the 2nd tm domain is critical for pi transport function in agreement with the former identification of the equivalent glutamate in human pit <dig>  as being critical for pi transport function  <cit> .

we have shown that a human pit <dig> mutant consisting of the  <dig> tm domains and minor loops  transports pi as wildtype pit <dig>  proving that the large intracellular domain  is dispensable for pi transport function. a further truncated human pit <dig> mutant consisting of the 1st to 4th tm domains linked to the 7th to 10th tm domains and the minor loop sequences connecting the tms , and which resembles archaeal and bacterial homologs, sustained low levels of pi transport. this protein harbors the prodom domains defining the pit family members and, moreover, harbors all the amino acids so far identified as being critical for pi transport function.

the above results showing that truncated human pit <dig> mutant proteins - one of which resembles a phosphate permease from bacteria and a putative phosphate permease from archaea - support pi transport, point to the conclusion that the overall structure of the pit family proteins has remained unchanged during evolution and that a basic pi-transporting unit exists.

protein sequence alignment of nine pit family members from all kingdoms. a the  <dig> putative tm domains according to the johann topology model are shown on the human pit <dig> sequence using black boxes with white filling  <cit> ; the putative large intracellular domain  of human pit <dig>  according to this model, spans the amino acid sequence: p236-v <dig>  the n-terminal and c-terminal pit family signature sequences  <cit>  are shown on the alignment in black boxes with grey filling. human pit <dig> e <dig> in the 2nd tm domain and human pit <dig> h <dig> in the 7th tm domain are indicated with circles. the tmhmm-predicted tm domains of the eukaryotic protein sequences for pit family members and the das-predicted tm domains of the prokaryotic protein sequences for pit family members are shown in black bold. the red bold sequences represent tm-domains, which we suggest exist, however, they were not predicted by the servers: n. crassa pho-4+ tm  <dig>  is suggested to be homologous to the tm  <dig> predicted in the c. elegans putative phosphate permease protein sequence. the presence of pho-4+ tm  <dig> is also based on the assumption that the n-terminal pit-family signature sequences should be placed equivalently  in all pit family members. a. thaliana pht2_ <dig> tm  <dig>  is suggested to be homologous to the tm  <dig> predicted in the t. brucei putative phosphate permease protein sequence. the presence of pht2_ <dig> tm  <dig> is also based on experimental assignment of the l <dig> for rat pit <dig> to the cytoplasmic space  <cit> , and pht2_ <dig> therefore requires a tm  <dig> to fulfill this criteria. h. sapiens pit <dig> tm  <dig>  is suggested to be homologous to the tm  <dig> predicted in the h. sapiens pit <dig> protein sequence. investigation of a human pit1/pit <dig> chimera where the pit <dig> backbone harbors the human pit <dig> sequence g120-v <dig> showed that this sequence conferred a-mlv receptor function upon human pit <dig>  <cit> , and the g120-v <dig> sequence is therefore highly likely extracellular in both human pit paralogs and this requires the presence of tm  <dig> in human pit <dig>  tm  <dig> domains in putative phosphate permeases from c. elegans , d. melanogaster , t. brucei , and n. crassa pho-4+  are suggested to be homologous to the tm  <dig> predicted in h. sapiens pit <dig> and pit <dig> sequences. the presence of tm  <dig> in putative phosphate permeases from c. elegans, d. melanogaster, t. brucei, and n. crassa pho-4+ is also based on the assumption that the c-terminal pit-family signature sequences should be placed equivalently  in all pit family members. moreover, investigation of a pho-4+/human pit <dig> chimera where the pho-4+ backbone harbors the human pit <dig> sequences c117-i <dig>  and l512-a <dig>  showed that these sequences confer a-mlv receptor function upon pho-4+ <cit> , and these sequences are therefore highly likely extracellular and this requires the presence of a tm  <dig>  similarly, investigation of a pho-4+/human pit <dig> chimera where the pho-4+ backbone harbors the human pit <dig> sequence l545-s <dig>  showed that these sequences confer galv receptor function upon pho-4+ <cit> . h. sapiens pit <dig> tm  <dig>  and h. sapiens pit <dig> tm  <dig>  are suggested to be homologous to the tm  <dig> predicted in rpho- <dig> r. norvegicus  protein sequence g601-s <dig>  using the tmhmm server . n. crassa pho-4+ tm  <dig>  is suggested to be homologous to the tm  <dig> predicted in c. elegans putative phosphate permease protein sequence. the tm  <dig> is required to orient the tm  <dig> equivalently in all pit family members. lower case letters represent tmhmm- or das-predicted tm sequences, which we based on either too small length to comprise a tm or due to suggested extracellular position  found were non-compatible with regular tm domains; however, these sequences might instead "dip" into the membrane lipid bilayer. it should be noted that these sequences are counted as being part of the loop sequences in figure  <dig>  a star   and a vertical line indicate the position of an intron-exon border in each of the human pit genes determined by use of the spidey mrna-to-genome dna alignment as described in "methods". below the alignment, the names, species, phylas, kingdoms, swiss-prot accession numbers, and the amino acid lengths of the nine proteins are given. b the server-predicted tm domains  and the by us suggested tm domains  for each of the nine pit family members are depicted in order to illustrate the conservedness of the tm domains: tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  > tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  > tm  <dig>  tm  <dig>  tm  <dig> > tm  <dig> > tm  <dig> . the white asterisk indicates a prediction of a unique tm domain in the unusually long n-terminal sequence of a. thaliana pht2_ <dig>
