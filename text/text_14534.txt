BACKGROUND
grapes have been cultivated and fermented into wine for more than  <dig>  years. worldwide, grapes are one of the most widely cultivated fruit crops, encompassing  <dig>  million hectares of arable land in  <dig>  <cit>  and with  <dig>  million metric tons produced in  <dig>  ranks second among bananas, oranges, and apples with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million metric tons respectively, produced during this same period. however, because the majority of the grapes that are harvested are fermented into wine, the economic impact for this commodity is far greater than the value of the grapes. for example, wine sales from california alone in  <dig> was at an all-time high and growing with approximately $ <dig> billion dollar in sales  <cit> . according to  <dig> statistics, the california wine industry has a $ <dig> and $ <dig> billion economic impact on the state and u.s. economies, respectively  <cit> .

in addition to their economic importance, consumption of grapes and wine has numerous nutritional and health benefits for humans  <cit> . for example, there are more than  <dig> polyphenolic compounds in red wines that are thought to act as antioxidants. in particular, one antioxidant compound, trans-resveratrol, has been shown to play a role in the prevention of heart disease   <cit>  and cancer  <cit> . resveratrol slows the aging process in animals  <cit> , acts as a signaling molecule in the brain  <cit> , and down-regulates the expression of genes that are involved in cell cycle and cell proliferation in human prostate cells  <cit> . therefore, for a variety of reasons, there is great interest in manipulating grape berry development and quality for both economic and health reasons.

in contrast to the well studied climacteric fruits such as tomato and apple, very little is known about the development and ripening processes of non-climacteric fruits such as grape or strawberry  <cit> . in  <dig>  coombe, one of the leaders in the field, described our knowledge of grape berry development and the regulation of ripening as "embryonic  <cit> ."

grape berries, like other berry fruits, undergo a complex series of physical and biochemical changes during development, which can be divided into three major phases  <cit>  with more detailed descriptive designations, known as the modified e-l system, being used to define more precise growth stages over the entire grapevine lifecycle  <cit> . during the initial stage of berry growth  cell division is rapid and all cells are established in the developing fruit in the first two weeks after flowering followed by a subsequent sigmoidal increase in berry size over approximately  <dig> days due to cell expansion. two important organic acids, tartrate and malate, are synthesized and reach maximal concentrations by the end of phase i. biosynthesis of tannins and hydroxycinnamates, which are major precursors for phenolic volatiles, also occurs, primarily during phase i. tannins are located primarily in the skin and seeds of the berry, and are perceived as astringent compounds important for color stability and the body of red wine.

phase ii is characterized as a lag phase during which there is no increase in berry size. biosynthetic processes are not well characterized for this stage, but it is known that sugar accumulation begins during this phase just prior to véraison   <cit> . véraison marks the start of phase iii of berry growth, which is characterized by the initiation of color development  and berry softening. berry growth is sigmoidal during phase iii, as the berries double in size. at the onset of this stage, sugars  continue to accumulate, and organic acid concentrations decline. the acid:sugar balance at harvest is critical for high quality wines, as it affects important sensory attributes  <cit> . a large number of the flavor compounds and volatile aromas are synthesized at the end of stage iii. many of these aromas are derived from terpenoids. however, the availability of seed tannins declines through oxidative processes during phase iii, causing the tannins to bind to the seed coat, reducing the astringent components within the berry. skin tannins begin to interact and bind with anthocyanins and each other, increasing tannin polymer size and complexity.

two major objectives of modern viticultural practices include the ability to produce a uniformly ripe crop and to harvest at optimal grape maturity. large variations in ripening among berries within a cluster and within a vineyard make it difficult to determine when a crop is at its best possible ripeness. the start of véraison is recognized to be a critical determinant for berry harvest dates, yet little is known about what initiates this important stage. a more detailed understanding of the complex changes in gene expression that orchestrate berry developmental processes is needed.

several mrna expression-profiling studies have been completed for vitis berries. differential screening of cdna libraries from  and northern blot analysis revealed that large differences in gene expression occur during berry ripening and led to the isolation of a large number of grape ripening-induced protein  genes  <cit> . monitoring of gene expression profiles in flowers and across six time points during grape  berry skin development to  <dig> weeks post-flowering resolved four sets of genes with distinctive and similar expression patterns using spotted cdna microarrays containing  <dig>  elements  <cit> . mrna expression was also studied across nine stages of wildtype cv. shiraz berry development   <cit>  and in a fleshless berry mutant cv. ugni blanc using oligonucleotide microarrays containing  <dig>  elements  <cit> . differences in transcript expression profiles in the skin of ripening fruit  of seven different cultivars were also examined using a  <dig>  feature cdna microarray  <cit> . in this study, we conducted mrna expression profiling on one of the widely grown varieties of v. vinifera  using the vitis affymetrix genechip® oligonucleotide microarray ver.  <dig> , which contains  <dig>  unigenes, over seven temporal stages  of berry development. we also correlated specific transcript profiles with specific metabolite profiles to gain deeper insights into discrete aspects of grape berry developmental dynamics.

RESULTS
grape berry development
vitis vinifera cv. cabernet sauvignon grapes were harvested on a weekly basis over the course of berry development from the shenandoah vineyard, plymouth, california during the summer of  <dig>  samples corresponding to stages  <dig> to  <dig> of the modified e-l system  <cit>  were measured for berry diameter, °brix  and titratable acidity . berry diameter increased over time with a classical double sigmoid pattern . average berry diameter increased during the first  <dig> weeks of development , followed by a cessation of berry expansion at  <dig> to  <dig> weeks post-anthesis , and then the increase in berry diameter resumed until maturity . °brix increased  <dig> weeks post-anthesis to a peak value of  <dig> °brix at  <dig> weeks post-anthesis . in contrast, titratable acidity , which reflects acid accumulation , increased steadily up to  <dig> weeks post-anthesis and then sharply declined at the start of véraison between e-l stages  <dig> and  <dig> reaching approximately  <dig> g/l of titratable acids at harvest .

microarray analysis
the mrna expression profiles of seven time points spanning e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig> as indicated in figure  <dig> were compared using the affymetrix genechip® vitis genome array ver.  <dig> . testing was performed using biological triplicates for each time point. multiple time points within stage ii  were sampled due to the large number of biochemical changes expected to occur around véraison that affect berry ripening and fruit quality. a visual inspection of the distributions of raw perfect match  probe-level intensities for all  <dig> arrays showed that the pre-processed and normalized pm intensities using robust multi-array average   <cit>  were consistent across all arrays. digestion curves describing trends in rna degradation between the 5' end and the 3' end in each probe set were examined and all  <dig> proved very similar . correlations among biological replicates were good: spearman coefficients ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; pearson coefficients ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

from the vitis  <dig>  probesets represented on the array , an overall mean call rate of  <dig> % per array  was obtained. data from the  <dig>  probe sets that were found to be present in at least two out of the three biological triplicates were retained for further analyses. after performing an anova and a multiple testing correction   <cit> , we found that  <dig>  probesets  were differentially expressed  between two or more e-l stages of berry development . because one unigene can be related to several probesets, the number of unigenes decreased to  <dig>  unigenes . these probesets will be hereby referred to as those passing the anova filter. from this set of genes, we extracted a subset of  <dig>  probesets that displayed a two-fold or greater change in steady-state transcript abundance over the course of development   representing  <dig>  unigenes  in the dfci grape gene index database vvgi <dig>  <cit> . we refer to this subset of genes as the two-fold ratio  set .

principal component analysis , was used to simplify and define associations between different developmental stages within the global transcriptomic data . two principal components explaining  <dig> % of the overall variance of transcription profiles  allowed us to clearly differentiate e-l stages  <dig> and  <dig> from the other developmental stages analyzed . it was not possible to clearly separate e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig> or  <dig> to  <dig> indicating that the transcription patterns occurring at these stages were similar to one another. however, stage  <dig>  which corresponds to early post-véraison, could be distinguished suggesting that transcription patterns at this point in berry ripening are unique to this critical stage in berry development. further analysis using a third axis explaining  <dig> % of the overall variance, confirmed the previous results and slightly improved the resolution among stages  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> 

clustering of significant genes
we used the pavlidis template matching  algorithm  <cit> , to divide the  <dig>  tfr unigenes into twenty gene groups or clusters. specifically, twenty gene profiles of interest were selected  to reflect major transcriptional patterns of development across e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig> . the ptm algorithm then classified the gene profiles into twenty groups via measurements of pearson correlation: a correlation coefficient of greater than  <dig>  was used to determine cluster membership. six profiles showed a steady decline  or increase  in steady-state transcript abundance over time with distinctly different slopes. these six profile groups encompassed 63% of the unigenes with a majority expressed in profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  and profiles  <dig> and  <dig> . eight profiles had transient peak increases  or decreases  in transcript abundance at each of e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig>  these transient profiles accounted for 22% of the unigenes. a majority  of these transiently expressed genes  exhibited increased transcript abundance with the highest proportion within profile group  <dig> , followed closely by profile group  <dig> , and profile group  <dig>  . interestingly, genes with transient decreases early in berry development  also exhibited large increases in transcript abundance during the later stages . the last four profiles  were selected as having two peaks of expression between e-l stages  <dig> and  <dig> . approximately  <dig> % of transcripts had such "up and down" expression patterns . finally, unigenes that did not match one of these profiles were grouped into a 21st cluster , accounting for 11% of the total transcripts considered . taken together, this analysis revealed that berry development is not only a progressive process, wherein the majority of genes exhibit a steady increase or decrease in expression across all stages of development , but also a dynamic process, wherein a large number of genes exhibit large, transient changes in transcript abundance at specific times of development. most notably, the last phase of berry development  was the time when the largest number of genes  exhibited transient increases in steady-state transcript abundance.

functional categorization of unigenes across different stages of development
functional categories were assigned to unigenes with two-fold or greater changes in steady-state transcript abundance over the course of the seven developmental stages using the munich information center for protein sequences  catalog with annotations of the top arabidopsis blast hits  <cit> . because we detected some errors in the functional annotation for some unigenes, functional categorization of each unigene were verified manually and corrected if necessary. corrections were only performed for the  <dig>  unigenes that displayed a two-fold or greater change in expression . functional annotations could be assigned to approximately 64% of transcripts . an additional 23% of unigenes had matches to genes with unknown functions or unclear classifications , and 13% did not have a blast hit  in public, non-redundant  databases. the relative distribution of unigenes within each of nineteen functional categories was determined . to facilitate a functional comparison of the three major stages of berry development, unigenes from each of the profile groups were regrouped into the three major developmental phases to reflect the greatest degree of transcript abundance changes at each phase: phase i , phase ii , and phase iii . statistically significant differences in the distribution of genes within functional categories amongst these developmental stages were observed . functional categories that had a large number of transcripts in phase i followed by a decrease in phase iii included biogenesis of cellular component , transport regulation , energy , and metabolism . this is consistent with the developmental aspects of this phase, which are characterized by cell division and expansion, which require a high level of metabolic activity. the process of cell division requires large quantities of structural materials and consumes energy, while cell expansion requires large quantities of solutes and water.

the opposite trend of increasing transcript abundance from phase i to phase iii was observed for functional groups that included transcription , protein synthesis , protein fate , protein with binding function , and to a lesser extent with interaction with cellular environment . these trends served to further indicate the complexity of the transcriptional, translational, and interaction-based regulatory processes necessary for berry development.

exemplar unigenes associated with important molecular events of berry development
in order to identify genes with potentially important roles in specific stages of berry development, transcripts with a dynamic pattern were identified from within the first  <dig> ptm algorithm-defined profile groups. the transcript profiles were examined in further detail .

polyamines  are a class of compounds that have plant growth regulator activity. their roles in cell division  <cit>  and fruit set  <cit>  have been widely investigated. free, conjugated and wall-bound forms of polyamines accumulate mostly at anthesis before decreasing at fruit set in grapes  <cit> . two transcripts were detected that belong to profile  <dig>  which are strongly down-regulated at e-l stage  <dig> . both are related to ornithine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase, which are involved in polyamine metabolism  <cit> . these two genes located at the start of the pa pathway might play a role in providing precursors that would be used during phase i of berry development.

in higher plants, the catabolism of asparagine  occurs by two routes. the first pathway involves the hydrolysis of asn, releasing ammonia and aspartate by asparaginase activity. l-asparaginase is one of the enzymes for asn utilization by plants that plays an important role in the nitrogen metabolism of developing plant tissues  <cit> . one unigene encoding l-asparaginase  displayed a specific peak during e-l stages  <dig> . this last result indicates that this enzyme could play a role during the first phase of berry development as a provider of ammonia for de novo protein synthesis in grape. this result is also supported by the significant transcript abundance of unigenes encoding glutamate dehydrogenase or glutamine synthetase  during the first phase of berry development. these enzymes participate in nitrogen assimilation in plants  <cit> .

in grape berries, fruit softening occurs during phase iii and is largely affected by cell-wall loosening  <cit>  and turgor  <cit> . xyloglucans account for about 10% of the cell wall composition in berries  <cit> . in fruit, xyloglucan depolymerization is associated with fruit softening  <cit> . xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, which hydrolyze and transglycosylate xyloglucans, were encoded by multiple isogenes, the majority of which were expressed highly during phase i in berry development , but then declined . one unigene , however, which is a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase, displayed a 185-fold increase in expression during phase ii, peaking at e-l stage  <dig> . this xyloglucan endotransglucosylase unigene is closely related to a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase  that can act reversibly. it has been characterized recently as a tomato xyloglucan depolymerase in vitro in the presence of xyloglucan oligosaccharides   <cit> .

expansins play important roles in cell wall loosening via non-enzymatic mechanisms and are involved in cell expansion  <cit> . most expansin genes displayed steadily increasing or decreasing patterns during berry development . others showed peak expression around e-l stage  <dig> . an expansin gene from strawberry, faexp <dig>  displays exactly the same peak transient expression pattern as these latter two genes at a comparable ripening stage as grape berries, called the white stage in strawberry fruits, just before red fruit color development  <cit> . thus, these expansins in grape berry may be required during the phase iii of grape berry development, when the second phase of cell expansion occurs.

terpenes, which are precursors for important aroma compounds  <cit> , accumulate at véraison  <cit> . one unigene encoding a limonene cyclase , which is in the monoterpene pathway, is involved in the conversion of geranyl diphosphate into limonene  <cit> . limonene and some of its derived compounds such as menthol or  <dig>  cineol are intimately associated with the "eucalyptus fragrance" of red wine  <cit> . accumulation of  <dig> -cineole in wines is derived from precursors in grape, like limonene. the strong induction of our unigene related to limonene cyclase  correlates well with the beginning of accumulation of  <dig> -cineole in red grape samples  <cit> . one unigene  belonging to profile  <dig> and encoding alcohol dehydrogenase exhibited strong homology with an  isopiperitenol dehydrogenase, which is involved in the same monoterpene pathway  <cit> . this transcript abundance of this unigene is correlated to the expression of the limonene cyclase previously discussed above indicating a possible activation of these enzymes in the same metabolic pathway  <cit> .

phytohormone biosynthesis and responses
a number of plant growth regulators including abscisic acid , auxin , ethylene, and gibberellic acid  have been implicated in the control of berry development and ripening. therefore, steady-state transcript accumulation patterns of unigenes with functions related to hormone biosynthesis and response were tracked over the course of berry development .

abscisic acid
aba amounts in berries decrease after anthesis, but then increase significantly at véraison  <cit> . external applications of aba to ripening fruit can accelerate berry development . the transcript abundance of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , which encodes the rate limiting step in aba biosynthesis, increased during the lag phase and peaked at stage  <dig> around the start of véraison . both nced <dig>  and nced <dig>  had similar expression patterns, but differed significantly in their relative trancript abundance. a transcript  encoding abi <dig>  showed an expression pattern like that of the nced genes, but was more highly correlated with nced <dig> than nced <dig>  the rd <dig> gene , a dehydration-responsive protein, displayed a very large increase in abundance at véraison that continued to increase during berry maturation, whereas another transcript  encoding an abi3/vp <dig>  transcription factor showed highest transcript abundance during the lag phase.

ethylene
traditionally, wine grape has been considered a non-climacteric fruit, however, there are studies that indicate that ethylene plays an important role in berry development and ripening  <cit>  and is required for increased berry diameter and ripening processes, such as anthocyanin biosynthetic gene expression and accumulation  <cit> . in addition, ethylene appears to be involved in controlling the expression of an alcohol dehydrogenase gene from grape  <cit> . furthermore, some inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis can delay berry ripening  <cit> . ethylene-related transcripts displayed some very unique and intriguing patterns of expression  indicating that this signaling pathway is differentially expressed along berry development. one transcript  encoding a putative ethylene response factor  <dig> , a putative ethylene output gene, displayed a steady increase in abundance with maximal expression at ripening  indicating a potential post-véraison role for this signaling pathway. an ethylene-induced transcription factor  exhibited transcript accumulation during the lag  and early véraison  stages of development. a putative ethylene co-activator  protein displayed biphasic peak transcript abundance at e-l stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the transcript abundance of acc oxidase , the enzyme responsible for the last step in ethylene biosynthesis, was highest at e-l stage  <dig>  the start of the lag phase, and then declined throughout the remainder of berry development. interestingly, the transcript abundance of an ethylene receptor ers <dig>  and ein4/etr <dig>  were at their lowest during e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig> until véraison, but then increased at a later stage . ethylene pathway activation in grape berry appears to occur within a three week period of berry development  when the highest ethylene  content and transcript abundance of acc oxidase were detected in cabernet sauvignon  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the observation that application of exogenous ethylene  <dig> weeks after anthesis hastened the ripening of the grape berries and resulted in a decrease in average cell size. in contrast, if the same ethylene treatment was applied during earlier stages of berry development , maturation was delayed  <cit> .

according to the arabidopsis model of ethylene signaling, reduced expression of transcripts and activity of receptors increases the sensitivity to ethylene, whereas increased receptor expression and activity decreases sensitivity  <cit> . in tomato, the expression of most genes encoding ethylene receptors increases during fruit development. in parallel, high levels of ethylene are expressed to counterbalance the negative effect of increased receptor expression on the ethylene signaling pathway  <cit> . in grape berry, the slight decreases observed in ethylene receptor transcript expression occurring between e-l stages  <dig> and  <dig> and the peak of ethylene accumulation during this same period, indicate a higher sensitivity to ethylene during the early stages of berry development. this would be expected to lead to a greater activation of the ethylene signaling pathway prior to véraison.

as in grape berry, strawberry is able to produce significant levels of ethylene during fruit development, but not to the same extent as climacteric fruits. recently, three ethylene receptors have been identified in strawberry  <cit> . two of them  display the same pattern of expression during fruit development as those observed for ers <dig> ethylene receptor during grape berry development. in addition, the highest rates of ethylene production in strawberry were detected in very young green fruits. following this, the hormone decreases continuously until the white stage of fruits. following this stage, ethylene showed a slight but steady increase for the remainder of development. when considered together, the similarities of expression of ethylene receptors during fruit development for both grapes and strawberries coupled with the concomitant ethylene production during the early steps of fruit development indicate a conserved mechanism for ethylene perception between these fruits prior to ripening.

brassinosteroids
brassinosteroids  have recently been implicated in playing an important role in berry development  <cit> . castasterone concentrations are low during the early stages of berry development and then increase at véraison  <cit> . brassinosteroids have been shown to increase cell size  <cit>  indicating that berry enlargement may be affected by castasterone levels. brh <dig> ring finger protein  transcript abundance, which is known to be down-regulated by exogenous application of br, decreased during e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig>  but increased in fully mature berries . the transcript abundance of the brassinosteroid receptor  <dig> gene  peaks at the start of the lag phase  and then declines thereafter. the transcript abundance of bru <dig> , which is a br-responsive transcript encoding a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase , showed a transient increase in abundance at véraison. in the same family, transcripts for another br-responsive protein  declined with berry development. clearly, there are many significant changes in transcript abundance that are associated with brassinosteroid responses during berry development.

gibberellins
very little is known about the role of gibberellin  in grape berry development except a possible role in cell enlargement. biologically active concentrations of ga are high in flowers and in fruits just after anthesis, but then drop to lower levels over the course of berry development  <cit> . there is a second peak of active ga at the start of the lag phase and it is  <dig> times higher in the seed compared to the berry mesocarp  <cit> . the transcript abundance of two putative ga receptors, gidl <dig> and gidl <dig> , increased during berry development . interestingly, the transcript abundance of the ga signaling pathway repressor, gai <dig> , declines transiently at véraison. the transcript abundance of a putative ga β-hydroxylase  declines over the course of berry development  more or less coincident with the known accumulation pattern of ga <dig> in developing berries.

auxins
the mechanisms by which the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid  regulates berry development are complex and not fully understood. increased auxin production produced through the action of an ovule-specific auxin-synthesizing transgene enhanced fecundity in grapes  <cit> . earlier reports indicated that auxin concentrations were high during early phase i and declined following véraison  <cit>  consistent with the role of this phytohormone in promoting cell division and expansion during phase i. treatment of grape berries with synthetic auxin-like compound, benzothiazole-2-oxyacetic acid  delayed ripening  <cit> . a more recent study showed that auxin concentrations remain relatively constant over the course of berry development  <cit> .

our data indicate that there are numerous transcript responses to auxin . the transcript abundance of aux <dig> , which forms heterodimers with auxin response factors  in order to repress auxin responses, increased after véraison . transcripts for both auxin response factor  <dig>  and a small auxin up rna protein   increased after véraison, whereas transcripts for a different saur transcript  and an auxin-induced response factor, arf <dig>  both declined in a very similar pattern during berry development. a transcript  encoding iaa-amino acid hydrolase, which is involved in iaa homeostasis, was highly expressed during the later stages of berry development . the synthesis and hydrolysis of iaa conjugates, which function in both permanent inactivation and temporary storage of auxin  <cit> , may play an important role in the control of iaa concentrations as berry development progresses. iaa-amino acid hydrolase may provide for local concentrations of auxins within the berries to promote mesocarp cell enlargement. several transcripts  related to auxin transport and perception also displayed increased abundance at the onset of véraison. given the importance of auxin-mediated processes in developing berries, more research needs to be conducted to elucidate the mode of action of auxin signaling and response pathways.

methyl jasmonate and cytokinins
methyl jasmonate  is known to promote the synthesis and accumulation of terpenes and resveratrol in berry cell cultures  <cit> , however, its effects in vivo are not well understood. the transcript abundance of 12-oxophytodienoate reductase  , which is involved in jasmonate biosynthesis  <cit> , and a constitutive pathogen-response  <dig> protein , both decreased with berry development . less is known about the role of cytokinins in berry development. the transcript abundance of cytokinin oxidase , which degrades cytokinin  <cit> , decreased over berry development, whereas a known cytokinin-response regulator, a type-a response regulator , showed a steady increase in transcript abundance over berry development .

new candidates genes associated with calcium signaling, flavonoid transport and flavor
calcium has many essential roles in plant growth and development  <cit> , however, the role of calcium signaling in grape berry development is largely unexplored. recently, an aba-responsive calcium-dependent protein kinase  was described that was specifically expressed in the seed and flesh of berries with increased transcript abundance over berry development and ripening  <cit> . in the current study, a large number of genes with functions related to calcium sequestration, transport and signaling were found to display developmentally regulated expression patterns .

calcium homeostasis within the cytosol is tightly controlled by membrane spanning ca2+-atpases and h+/ca2+ exchangers, which typically maintain low concentrations of ca2+ in the cytosol and restore this concentration following signaling-related transient changes in calcium levels. transcripts encoding plasma membrane ca2+-atpase genes , which are closely related to aca <dig> and aca <dig>  respectively, in arabidopsis thaliana, showed increased transcript abundance during e-l stages  <dig> and  <dig> and in later developmental stages. interestingly, aba markedly and rapidly stimulates the expression of the aca <dig> gene in cell cultures of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . a tonoplast ca2+/h+ exchanger , which is a close homolog of cax <dig> from a. thaliana and plays a key role in cytosolic ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> , showed a transient increase in transcript abundance at e-l stages  <dig>  indicating a possible role for calcium signaling around véraison.

aba accumulates until two weeks after the beginning of véraison before decreasing later in berry development  <cit> . thus, it is likely that aba is directly or indirectly involved in the control of ca2+ signaling and homeostasis events, particularly around véraison.

the increased expression of several unigenes encoding calmodulin or calcium interacting protein kinases  supports this hypothesis  <cit> . one unigene encoding a calmodulin-related suppressor of gene silencing  displayed a pronounced pattern with two peaks of expression at e-l stage  <dig> and at e-l stage  <dig> corresponding to two transitions of berry development . this unigene displayed a 10-fold change in its transcript abundance across berry development and may be involved in the suppression of posttranscriptional gene silencing  by interacting with a proteinase known to suppress ptgs in plants  <cit> . this correlation indicates a possible role for calcium in regulating the activity of the ptgs mechanisms. to date, only one paper reported the possibility of the involvement of ptgs in the regulation of gene expression during plant development  <cit> . further investigations are necessary to evaluate the real impact of this unigene in the triggering of véraison.

phenolic compounds, derived from flavonoids , are the major wine constituents responsible for organoleptic properties such as color and astringency. twenty-one unigenes encoding biosynthetic enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways were found to exhibit differential mrna expression patterns across berry development . the vast majority of these genes are expressed predominantly in the skin  <cit> .

the mechanisms by which anthocyanins accumulate in the vacuole of grape berry skin cells during phase iii are not fully understood. these compounds must be transported from the site of synthesis in the cytosol to their final destination, the vacuole. several models have been proposed for sequestering anthocyanins in the vacuole in arabidopsis thaliana. one model  <cit>  indicates the action of a glutathione-s-transferase  in facilitating the transfer of anthocyanins into the vacuole. another model indicates that a transporter of the multidrug-resistance-associated protein family could facilitate the transport of an anthocyanin-gst complex into the vacuole  <cit> . here, the unigene transcript encoding a gst  displayed a 63-fold increase in abundance during the stages in berry development in which flavonoids accumulate . this unigene is closely related to a gst homolog known to be involved in anthocyanin sequestration  <cit> . this unigene also displays a skin-specific expression pattern  <cit> , which is consistent with the tissue localization of anthocyanins. a unigene homologous to a glutathione-s-conjugate transporting atpase  showed a peak of expression at véraison . while not yet characterized in detail, this unigene belongs to the abc transporter sub-family, members of which are known to transport anthocyanins  <cit> . the putative multi-drug transporter , which is known to be involved in the sequestration of tannins into vacuoles  <cit> , exhibited peak transcript abundance at e-l stage  <dig> followed by a decline, and is consistent with the pattern of maximal tannin accumulation that occurs a few weeks before véraison.

specific members of the myb transcription factor family play critical roles in the regulation of flavonoid metabolism during grape berry development  <cit> . we detected four transcripts encoding myb transcription factors that have been previously characterized in grape berry   <cit> . vvmybpa <dig>  regulates the proanthocyanidin  pathway in the grape berry  <cit> . in the shiraz cultivar, vvmybpa <dig> peak expression appears to occur during e-l stages  <dig> and  <dig> in the skin and seeds, whereas, in cabernet sauvignon this gene is expressed at an earlier developmental stage  . such differences are likely to be cultivar-dependent. in the same way, the myc family of transcription factors also plays a key role in regulation of the anthocyanin pathway. one myc transcription factor transcript , which shares strong amino acid sequence identity with myc genes known to be involved in the regulation of anthocyanin production  <cit> , displayed a pattern of transcript accumulation that decreased from the beginning of berry development until e-l stage  <dig> and then increased for the remainder of fruit development . furthermore, this unigene is preferentially expressed in the skin  <cit> . these expression patterns correlate well with the accumulation of anthocyanins and proanthocyanins.

in grape berries, volatile aroma compounds, such as terpenes, benzenoids, and phenylpropanoids, accumulate in exocarp and mesocarp tissues following the initiation of berry ripening  <cit> . three transcripts  encoding o-methyltransferases, which may participate in the biosynthesis of volatile compounds, were also detected  <cit> . the first unigene , which encodes a putative phloroglucinol o-methyltransferase, is involved in the biosynthesis of volatile  <dig> ,5-trimethoxybenzene, a compound not previously described in grape  <cit> , displayed a very high transcript abundance at the beginning of berry development  before decreasing after véraison until e-l stage  <dig> and then increasing again in mature berries . the second unigene  was expressed at e-l stage  <dig>  but then declined. the third unigene  displayed very low transcript abundance with a slight increase following véraison . finally, two s-adenosyl-l-methionine :salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferases were identified with developmentally-induced expression patterns. the first unigene  showed a broad peak of expression between e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas the second unigene  showed increased transcript abundance after véraison  . such genes are thought to play important roles in scent production or plant defense  <cit> . little correlation between the level of sequence similarity and the structural similarity of their substrates has been observed for most of these protein families, so that gene functions have to be assigned following detailed biochemical testing  <cit> .

organic acid and proline metabolism
the acid:sugar balance at harvest is an important factor of wine quality as it affects important sensory attributes  <cit> . two major organic acids that contribute to titratable acidity, tartrate and malate, are the most abundant organic acids in grapes and reach maximal concentrations around the end of phase i . tartrate concentrations were found to peak at e-l stage  <dig> and then declined steadily until harvest, e-l stage  <dig> . tartrate concentrations decreased in parallel with three different transcripts encoding l-idonate dehydrogenase , a key enzyme in tartrate biosynthesis  <cit> . the innermost region of the berry pulp surrounding the seed has been shown to contain the highest tartrate concentrations  <cit> . consistent with this observation, tartrate synthase transcripts have been shown to be more abundant in seeds than in outer mesocarp and skin tissues  <cit> .

like tartrate, malate concentrations peaked around e-l stage  <dig>  but then declined more rapidly than tartrate during berry ripening . in contrast to the good correlation between tartrate and l-idonate dehydrogenase transcript abundance, there is a less obvious correlation between malate concentrations and the transcript abundance of unigenes encoding malate dehydrogenases . transcript abundance for two isogenes encoding cytosolic nad-dependent malate dehydrogenases , which catalyze the interconversion of malate to oxaloacetate, increased during ripening. transcripts for mitochondrial isoforms of the enzyme  also increased over this same time period. in contrast, the transcript abundance of a nadp-dependent malic enzyme , which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, declined slightly from e-l stages  <dig> to  <dig>  but then increased by stage  <dig> . the slight increase in the expression of all of these enzymes together may contribute to the declining concentrations of malate during ripening. very little is known about the mechanisms of malate transport processes in the phloem/xylem and within developing grape berries. the regulation of malate concentrations in berries appears to be quite complex. more research is needed to elucidate this well known developmental process.

mature berries contain unusually high concentrations of free proline; proline being the most abundant amino acid in cabernet sauvignon  <cit> . proline concentrations increased significantly at véraison and remained high until berries were fully ripe . transcripts encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase , the key regulatory enzyme in proline biosynthesis, remained relatively constant with a small peak of expression occurring at e-l stage  <dig> . proline dehydrogenase transcripts , which encode the first enzymatic step in proline catabolism, increased only during the latter stages of berry development. these mrna expression patterns are consistent with earlier reports and with protein expression patterns of these enzymes  <cit> . proline accumulation correlated poorly with steady-state transcript and protein abundance changes for these two enzymes indicating that proline production is regulated by posttranslational mechanisms  <cit> . steady-state transcripts encoding a proline transport protein  also increased in conjunction with proline abundance.

sugar metabolism
sugar accumulation in grape berries has been well studied because sugar content is a key factor in producing wine. in contrast to organic acids, hexose sugars  begin to accumulate substantially in the lag phase  and continue thereafter. in grapevines, carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis are exported from the leaf as sucrose and transported in the phloem to the berry cluster  <cit> . prior to véraison, most sugars imported into the berries are metabolized with little if any storage of these compounds. following véraison, however, sugars accumulate in the vacuole to high levels in the form of glucose and fructose following the enzymatic cleavage of sucrose . monosaccharide transporters direct the transport of these sugars through different organelles  <cit> .

in the berries in this study, fructose was more abundant than glucose; in contrast sucrose concentrations remained relatively low and constant throughout berry development . transcript abundance for the unigene encoding sucrose synthase , increased gradually over berry development consistent with increased hexose accumulation in the berry. this unigene has high homology with the sucrose synthase  in citrus unshiu  <cit> . citsusa also increases with fruit development and catalyzes the reaction in the cleavage direction . komatsu et al.  <cit>  suggest that the action of this gene may be important for sink strength.

sucrose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase  , which catalyzes the last step in sucrose synthesis, showed a slight increase in transcript abundance after e-l stage  <dig> and then remained relatively constant throughout the remainder of berry development . in contrast, the transcript abundance of two vacuolar invertases, gin <dig> and gin <dig> , which catalyze the catabolism of sucrose to fructose and glucose, declined over the course of berry development , consistent with an earlier report  <cit> . the mrna expression of these two invertases is consistent with the early increases in sugar accumulation during phase ii . on the other hand, transcript abundance for a neutral invertase  and a cell wall acid invertase  remained relatively constant during the course of berry development consistent with earlier reports on the amount and activity of these enzymes in developing berries  <cit> . in grape berries, sucrose cleavage is largely catalyzed by cell wall bound invertases  <cit> . sucrose cleavage is usually associated with cell wall invertase activity at the onset of ripening, together with a shift towards apoplastic phloem unloading of sugars in berries during this same period of time  <cit> . finally, transcripts encoding fructokinase , which catalyzes the formation of fructose-6-phosphate and may regulate starch formation, declined in abundance in a similar manner as gin <dig> and gin <dig> following a peak of expression at e-l stage  <dig> 

in most sink cells, sucrose is either cleaved by invertase into glucose and fructose or degraded by sucrose synthase into uridine-5'-diphosphate  glucose and fructose for subsequent metabolism and biosynthesis  <cit> . cell wall invertases appear to play the main role in the cleavage of sucrose during phase iii of berry development  <cit> . however, the increase in sucrose synthase during phase iii of berry development indicates that this isogene may participate in the catabolism of sucrose to fructose and glucose. alternatively, this sucrose synthase isogene may play a critical role in cellulose synthesis associated with phase iii cell expansion similar to its role in cotton fiber elongation  <cit> . two cellulose synthase isogenes  displayed increased transcript abundance during phase ii and iii, consistent with this hypothesis . additional developmentally regulated transcripts related to carbohydrate metabolism and transport are summarized in table  <dig> 

hexose and triose phosphate transport
the transcript abundances of numerous hexose and triosephosphate transporters varied considerably over the course of berry development  indicating that each may fulfill different transport roles. the transcript abundance for a vvht <dig> , a previously described hexose transporter  located at the sieve cell-companion cell interface in the phloem and thought to play a major role in providing energy  for cell division and cell growth during the early stages of berry development  <cit> , was high during phase i, but then declined rapidly during ripening; this is largely consistent with an earlier report  <cit> . a second hexose transporter, vvht <dig>  exhibited a peak in transcript abundance near the start of véraison , which correlated well with hexose accumulation in the berries , indicating that this transporter may play a significant role in hexose accumulation during berry ripening. another previously described sucrose transporter   <cit> , exhibited decreased transcript abundance throughout berry development consistent with earlier observations.

a putative plastidic glucose transporter  showed increased transcript abundance up to e-l stage  <dig> and then remained constant throughout berry ripening . the transcript abundance of a putative plasma membrane sugar/polyol transporter , which resembles the atplt <dig> gene from a. thaliana  <cit>  and is also capable of hexose transport, increased gradually over the course of berry development. in addition, two transcripts encoding a plastidial phosphate translocator-like  protein  and a plastidial triosephosphate/phosphate translocator, tpt   <cit>  displayed similar expression patterns that peaked at e-l stage  <dig> and then declined with berry ripening. the observed patterns of expression of the plastidial glucose and triosephosphate transporters indicate that both glucose and triosephosphates may be mobilized as export products as a result of active starch metabolism in plastids of developing and ripening berries.

finally, a sorbitol transporter  that has high homology with a cherry sorbitol transporter   <cit> , has high transcript abundance early in fruit development as it does in cherry fruit. this transporter has high specificity for sorbitol as compared to its isomer, mannitol  <cit> . we were able to detect a sugar alcohol in our polar extracts using gc-ms, but were unable to distinguish whether it was sorbitol or mannitol. further work will be done to distinguish sorbitol from mannitol. note, however, that sorbitol has been detected in the sap of grapevines  <cit> .

starch metabolism
starch metabolism in developing and ripening grape berries is poorly understood. starch synthase i catalyzes the elongation of glucans by the addition of glucose residues from adp-glucose through the formation of α- <dig>  linkages and is a major determinant for the synthesis of transient starch reserves in plants  <cit> . our data indicate that starch metabolism is significant in berries. starch concentrations declined significantly during phase iii of berry development; e-l stage  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were equal to  <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> μg of glucose per g fresh weight of berry, respectively .

furthermore, the transcript abundance of numerous transcripts involved in starch metabolism changed during berry development. one plastidial soluble starch synthase unigene  displayed increasing transcript abundance, while a second unigene  displayed decreasing transcript abundance during berry development . a transcript for the plastidial α-glucan, water dikinase  gene , which encodes an enzyme that is a regulator of starch mobilization and is essential for starch degradation  <cit> , showed increased accumulation during berry development much like starch synthase i . a second gwd isogene , showed peak transcript expression at e-l stage  <dig>  but declined in fully ripe berries. expression of plastidial α- <dig>  glucan phosphorylase , a starch mobilization enzyme that phosphorylates amylopectin to catalyze the release of glucose-1-phosphate, was nearly coordinate with the expression of this latter gwd isogene. finally, transcripts encoding the starch degrading enzymes, α-amylase  and β-amylase , both showed increased abundance during berry development . grape berries are likely to contain intact and functional plastids at véraison and at later stages of ripeness as shown by in situ fixation of exocarp and mesocarp cells  <cit> .

photosynthesis and carbon assimilation
during berry development transcripts encoding proteins associated with photosynthesis-related functions are strongly expressed during the flowering stage and the so-called "herbaceous phase" or phase i of berry development with expression declining during the later stages of berry maturation  <cit> . in our data, around  <dig> unigenes with photosynthesis-related functions were identified with most displaying a steady or transient decline in the transcript abundance across berry development . similarly, transcripts encoding enzymes with roles in carbon assimilation also exhibited a declining pattern of expression. for instance, unigenes encoding calvin cycle enzymes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphoribulokinase , transketolase  as well as ribulose biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit  were highly expressed and then declined during phase iii of berry development consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

circadian cycles
circadian clocks are signaling networks that enhance an organism's growth, survival, and competitive advantage in rhythmic day/night environments  <cit> . the plant circadian clock modulates a wide range of physiological and biochemical events, such as stomatal and organ movements, photosynthesis and induction of flowering. a model of circadian rhythm based upon activities of several enzymes has been created involving transcription factors such as circadian clock-associated  <dig>  or pseudo-response regulators such as prr <dig>  <cit> . transcripts for unigene  encoding cca <dig> were repressed during the early stages of berry development, but increased in abundance at e-l stage  <dig>  in contrast, one unigene  related to the two-component response regulator aprr <dig> had a transient peak of expression in the early stages of berry development. this result is consistent with the position and function of these proteins in the circadian clock. indeed, aprr <dig> represses cca <dig> activity in arabidopsis thaliana. in grape, these correlations in the transcript abundance indicate the operation of the circadian clock machinery throughout berry development. in addition, those genes are thought to enhance starch mobilization, consistent with previous observations made during phase iii of berry development  <cit> .

pathogen and disease resistance related proteins
pathogen-related  proteins are the most abundant class of proteins present in wine and can negatively affect the clarity and stability of wine  <cit> . during berry development, pr genes are expressed highly throughout various stages of berry growth. around  <dig> unigenes encoding different classes of pr genes were identified with a two-fold ratio or greater expression change . interestingly, four unigenes encoding pr <dig> protein were highly expressed during early berry development, but then declined for the remainder of berry development. pr <dig> protein is regarded as one of the main down-stream responses of the salicylic acid signaling that plays an important role in systemic acquired resistance. salycylic acid is thought to accumulate just before véraison, which correlates well with the pr <dig> mrna and protein expression  <cit> . the two main pr proteins that have a significant role in the defense against invading fungal pathogens are β- <dig> -glucanase  and chitinase   <cit> . five unigenes encoding β- <dig> -glucanase were transiently expressed at different periods of berry development. unigenes encoding various chitinases were also identified that displayed similar mrna expression patterns. some chitinase genes exhibit strong homologies with a chitinase previously observed in grape berry  <cit> . another pr protein, which may play a role in grape berry defense, is thaumatin protein   <cit> . eight unigenes encoding pr <dig> proteins were identified and their respective expression patterns span all stages of berry development. taken together, the expression patterns revealed that these defense-related gene products and enzymes are expressed across all stages of berry development. such a systemic acquired resistance strategy probably minimizes pathogen invasion as previously suggested  <cit> .

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
to validate expression profiles obtained using the affymetrix genechip® vitis genome array, quantitative real-time rt-pcr was performed on  <dig> genes using gene-specific primers . transcript abundance patterns were calculated along the entire course of berry development. linear regression  analysis showed an overall correlation coefficient of  <dig>  indicating a good correlation between transcript abundance assessed by real-time rt-pcr and the expression profiles obtained with the genechip® genome arrays .

CONCLUSIONS
our large-scale transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that nearly a third  of genes expressed in berries exhibited at least two-fold or greater change in steady-state transcript abundance over the course of seven stages of grape berry development. approximately two-thirds  of these unigenes could be assigned a functional annotation with the remaining one-third having obscure or unknown functions. twenty distinct patterns of expression were resolved in order to illustrate the complex transcriptional regulatory hierarchies that exist to orchestrate the dynamic metabolic, transport, and control processes occurring in developing berries. we provided evidence that phytohormone biosynthesis and responses, particularly for aba, ethylene, brassinosteroids, and auxins, as well as calcium homeostasis, transport, and signaling processes play critical roles in this developmental process. we also demonstrate that the expression and regulation of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and expansion, as well as genes involved in the biosynthesis, transport, and regulation of the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways undergo dynamic changes throughout the course of berry development. our analysis has revealed candidate genes that may participate in the production of different classes of aroma producing compounds. we have also demonstrated coordinate regulation of transcripts and the accumulation of key metabolites including tartrate, malate, and proline during berry development. a close examination of the behavior of gene expression patterns of genes involved in sugar and starch metabolism indicate that plastidial starch reserves are mobilized to fuel the production of hexose sugars during the ripening and maturation phase  of berry development. finally, our findings provide the first functional genomic information for hundreds of genes with obscure functions that can be exploited for hypothesis testing by traditional functional assays to improve our understanding of the complex developmental processes present in grape berries and to ultimately utilize this information to improve quality traits of wine grapes.
