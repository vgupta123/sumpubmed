BACKGROUND
more than half of human cancers have a mutation in the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> or one of its target genes  <cit> . the p <dig> gene has been implicated as a master regulator of genomic stability, cell cycle, apoptosis, and dna repair  <cit> . p <dig> regulates its target genes through binding specifically to a palindromic consensus sequence, rrrcwwgyyy--rrrcwwgyyy  <cit> . since the consensus-binding site for p <dig> has been established  <cit> , many p <dig> target genes have been identified experimentally  <cit> . computational algorithms were also developed to explore the potential p53-response elements  on a genomic scale  <cit> . currently, there are >  <dig> experimentally verified p53-re sequences, with >  <dig> high-probability p <dig> loci  <cit> . one feature of p <dig>  however, confounds the discovery of novel transregulated genes; while some binding sites match the expected consensus sequence quite well, others can be consensus-poor and yet are both necessary, and sufficient, to transactivate a gene  <cit> . not surprisingly, nearly all known res are reported to contain at least one mismatch in the decamer  <cit> . a recent study noted that although the spacer region between half sites for p53-res can range from zero to  <dig> bases, smaller spacer lengths are preferred  <cit> .

computational approaches for identifying putative p53-res from the target genes are based on position weight matrices . these pwms are matrices with expectation frequency defined for each nucleotide at each position of the res. though commonly used, pwms in general have their own limitations , and two of these limitations are applicable to p53-res: i) pwms cannot define motifs of variable lengths, and ii) pwms cannot model interactions between nucleotides. in the case of p53-res, even though the two constituent half-site length is fixed , the re length itself varies because of the variable length of the spacer separating the two half-sites. additionally, the nucleotide interactions within the p53-re define its binding affinity  <cit> . building on these rudimentary profile scores, more sophisticated methods like p53mh have been developed  <cit> . however, these methods are based on res known either to bind or not bind p <dig> and not on their activity and impact on p <dig> transactivation itself. in general, the degree of responsiveness depends on various factors including the state of the p <dig> protein  <cit> , its cofactors  <cit> , and the sequence composition of the p53-re itself  <cit> . although a recent prediction method takes into account experimentally derived protein saturation levels for various p53-res mutated systematically  <cit> , it does not take into account the spacer length or composition in p53-res. instead it considers the effect of individual nucleotides on binding affinity as additive.

extending on an earlier methodology  <cit> , in the current study, we developed a two-step procedure for quantitative prediction of the p53-re transactivation capability. in the first step, we used multidimensional scaling to map all the training p53-res into a euclidean space. in the second step, we used multinomial logistic regression to regress the distance between the p53-res in the euclidean space against their known binding affinities. the training data for relative transactivation of p53-res were obtained from our recent study  <cit> , wherein, using a combination of custom bioinformatics and multispecies alignment of promoter regions, we investigated the functional evolution of p53-res in terms of responsiveness to the p <dig>  we identified res orthologous to known p <dig> targets in human and rodent cells or, alternatively, res related to the established p <dig> consensus. the orthologous res were assigned p <dig> transactivation capabilities  based on rules determined from model systems  <cit> . the underlying hypothesis for the current study is that p53-res with similar binding site composition and spacer length have similar transactivation capability. our goal is to predict the transactivation score of a novel p53-re based mostly on the dissimilarity or distance from existing known p53-res with known transactivation capability. we demonstrate the utility of our model by  ranking putative p <dig> target genes based on their predicted transactivation;  comparing the performance of our approach with a previously reported method  <cit> ;  identifying and ranking putative p53-target microrna promoters; and  predicting the implications of single nucleotide polymorphisms  within p53-res on p <dig> transactivation.

RESULTS
regression-based transactivation capability predictor for p53
we used  <dig> previously validated p53-res along with their transactivation capabilities from  <dig> different species  <cit>  for training and testing a regression-based p <dig> binding predictor. briefly, we used multidimensional scaling to map all the training p53-res into a euclidean space followed by multinomial logistic regression to regress the distance between the p53-res in the euclidean space against their known binding affinities. we used the distance between the validated p53-res and their spacer lengths as features for training a multinomial logistic regression model . our method was based on a similar affinity predictor designed for nf-kappa b  <cit> . however, contrary to nf-kappa b, p53-res are not of fixed length primarily because of the varied spacer lengths separating the two half-sites. earlier publications  <cit>  on p53-res point out that the binding affinity of the re depends on the sequence of the dimer and the length of the spacer. hence, for training purposes we ignored the sequence of the spacer and formed 20-mer sequences from the training data. overall there were  <dig> unique p53-res having spacer lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp.

we used multidimensional scaling  <cit>  to project these  <dig> sequences onto a multidimensional euclidean space such that the distance between any two sequences was approximately equal to their dissimilarity. we were able to transform these sequences into a 116-dimensional subspace. though 90% of the variance in the data could be captured by just  <dig> dimensions, we decided to retain all the  <dig> dimensions for accuracy and also because these dimensions would be automatically obtained for a novel p53-re. it is therefore reasonable to conclude that  <dig> dimensions capture the complex nucleotide interactions that are ignored by earlier additive models. figure  <dig> shows the percentage of variance captured as a function of number of dimensions . in addition to the euclidean space dimensions, we also obtained the spacer associated with each 20-mer p53-re in the training set. on the whole, we used  <dig>  +  <dig>  =  <dig> features as input to the regression analysis.

performance and usability of the model – cross validation
we used ten-fold and leave-one-out cross validations to test the performance and usability of our model. pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between observed and predicted transactivation capabilities. for ten-fold cross-validation we obtained correlations of  <dig>  and  <dig>   for models without and with spacers, respectively. in the case of leave-one-out cross-validation, we obtained correlations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for models without and with spacers, respectively. we were unable to find correlation for each fold separately as each has only one test case in leave-one-out cross-validation. surprisingly, we did not observe a significant difference between training with and without spacers. this could probably be because the training data spacer distribution is highly skewed toward the lower values. in other words, only  <dig> of the  <dig> p53-res had a spacer of length  <dig> bp or higher. nevertheless, we noted some improvement in the performance  when spacers was used as a feature, although it is not statistically significant. to test whether the correlation results are skewed toward a specific transactivation capability value, we obtained the average predicted capability for each level of true capability. figure  <dig> shows the "predicted" and "observed" transactivation capabilities for leave-one-out cross-validation. both the models – without and with spacers – performed similarly. however, toward the lower levels of observed capability, we noticed a slight increase in the average predicted capability levels, though not statistically significant. this was especially apparent for levels  <dig> and  <dig>  which correspond to "non-responsive" and "poor" transactivation capabilities, respectively. both models performed well in predicting the higher capability values.

in addition to the five different levels of binding, the model can also be used simply to test if a specific p53-re could be functional or not. for this, we considered the capability levels "non-responsive" and "poor" to be non-functional, while the categories "slight", "moderate", and "high" were classified as functional. a leave-one-out cross-validation with this assumption resulted in a sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig> .

comparison with other methods
to compare the performance of veprintsev's model  <cit>  with our approach, we ran their algorithm on the same set of  <dig> res we used for training. the correlation was only - <dig>  between the predicted and observed output. since a comparison between categorical observed transactivation capability and continuous predicted binding affinity is not really intuitive, we divided the input test set into functional and non-functional res as described in the previous sections. we also divided the predicted affinity into functional and non-functional based on a default cut-off of - <dig>  as provided by the software. we noticed that while the sensitivity of the predictor was a high  <dig> , the specificity was only  <dig> , suggesting that the predictor inaccurately overestimates a non-functional re as functional about 63% of the time. on the contrary, this estimate was only 21% using our model. to further confirm this we divided the input test set as non-functional if capability level was "non-responsive" and functional for other capability levels. using veprintsev's model, we obtained a sensitivity and specificity of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while for our model it was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. although we observed a moderately decreased specificity for our model, it is still better than the  <dig>  cut-off for a random predictor. in spite of the high false positive rate the simplistic additive basics of the veprintsev p <dig> algorithm make it a good complementary tool for affinity prediction.

transactivation capability prediction of known validated p53-res
a total of  <dig> unique known validated human p53-res of at least  <dig> bp length were obtained from four publications, namely, jegga et al.  <cit> , horvath et al.  <cit> , riley et al.  <cit> , and ma et al.  <cit> . we obtained the predicted tranasactivation capability and binding affinity from our model and the algorithm from veprintsev et al.  <cit> , respectively. figures 3a and 3b show the frequency distribution of the predictor output of veprintsev and our model, respectively. the frequency distributions highlight two important aspects. first, most of the validated p <dig> binding sites are predicted positive by both of the algorithms,  <dig> % by veprintsev and  <dig> % by our model. second, the distributions follow normality skewed toward the higher binding affinity/transactivation capability levels. these results confirm the veracity of the algorithms and their conformity with each other in terms of sensitivity.

to further analyze the relationship between predicted transactivation capability levels obtained through our method and the validated p53-re sequence features, we first separated the p53-res by their capability levels. using weblogo  <cit>  we obtained the consensus sequence logos representing the frequency of each nucleotide at each position for each of the capability levels . not surprisingly, the consensus  obtained by including res corresponding to all capability levels revealed an enrichment of nucleotides ''c'' and ''g'' in the cwwg core of the p53-re. this was in fact irrespective of all capability levels. figure 4b shows the consensus logo formed by sequences including only p53-res categorized under transactivation capability level of ''4''. we observed that several res had ''at'' in the cwwg consensus, including the lower capability categories. however, it is worth noting that the sequences with predicted transactivation level ''0'' , had a weak cwwg consensus. additionally, many purines  were observed in the "yyy" consensus of the second dimer. all these results highlight the differences between the predicted lower capability p53-res and the p <dig> consensus.

since it is well known that the transactivation capability of the p53-re depends both on the sequence composition of the dimers and the spacer length, we next analyzed the variation in the p53-re sequence from the consensus, and the variation in the spacer length with respect to the transactivation capability . both the average sequence dissimilarity and the spacer length showed a decreasing trend with respect to the transactivation capability. however, there was a slight increase in the average spacer length for capability value "2" compared to capability value " <dig> " considering that transactivation capability is affected by both dimer sequence dissimilarity from consensus and the spacer length, we fitted a curve on these variables. we noticed a distinct pattern wherein there was a decreasing pattern of the curve with increasing transactivation capability. however, we still noticed some deviation from the decreasing pattern. there could be several reasons for this: i) when measuring the p53-re sequence dissimilarity, the consensus sequence was taken to be that with the highest transactivation capability 2); ii) previous studies reported a bimodal induction of transactivation capability, especially with spacer length  <cit> ; and iii) several other features like interaction between nucleotides that are captured by our predictor could affect the transactivation capability to deviate from the expected value .

transactivation capability prediction of non-validated p53-res
after initial testing that our algorithm is capable of predicting a significant number of validated p53-res as functional, we sought to rank the known human p53-res  reported in the literature based on their putative transactivation capability predicted by our approach. to do this, we compiled  <dig> res from the literature  <cit> . these literature-compiled p53-res represent a collection of high-confidence putative p <dig> binding sites obtained using chip-chip and in-silico methods. in order to further prioritize or rank these p53-res based on their predicted transactivation capability, we used p53mh  <cit>  to obtain the p53-re scores and then applied our predictor. although several of these p53-res were predicted positive by both p53mh and our algorithm, only  <dig> of them had a p53mh score of  <dig> and a high capability score of "4" by our algorithm  and of these only  <dig> p53-res  have been experimentally validated. additional file  <dig> shows the scores for all the known p53-res .

these  <dig> top ranked res had a p53mh score of  <dig> and a transactivation capability score of "4" by our algorithm. of these, only  <dig> p53-res  have been experimentally validated in previous studies.

prediction of transactivation capability for putative p53-res in microrna promoters
we used the "high confidence" microrna promoters  from fujita and iba  <cit>  and in the first step ran the p53mh algorithm  <cit>  to obtain putative high-scoring p <dig> binding sites in these mirna promoter regions. the p53mh parameters were set to obtain only the top  <dig> high-scoring p53-re matches. in the second step, we used our transactivation scoring model to predict the transactivation capability of each of the p53-re matches. out of  <dig> putative p53-res occurring in  <dig> micrornas,  <dig> p53-res  were predicted with high scores  by p53mh. out of these  <dig> res  were predicted with a transactivation score of at least "1" by our model. we intersected our results with a list of mirnas that have been reported to be either induced or suppressed following p53-activation  <cit> . we found that  <dig> induced , and  <dig> repressed  micrornas had high-scoring putative p53-res . the fact that mir-34a, the known p53-regulated mirna, was identified by our model as a high affinity target  supports the ability of our model's potential in predicting p53-res' transactivation capability.

performance of regression model with varying spacer length
although variable p53-re spacer lengths are known to affect transactivation capacity  <cit> , to the best of our knowledge none of the current algorithms consider spacers as one of the parameters when predicting the transactivation capability of p53-re. thus, for the first time, we have incorporated spacer length as one of the features in our regression model for predicting the transactivation capability of p53-re. to test specifically the performance of our model in predicting the transactivation capability of res with different spacer lengths, we compiled literature-reported validated p53-res and artificially varied their spacer length , keeping the dimer composition constant. for simplicity, we have grouped the results into different categories based on the fold-change  in transactivation capacity with varied spacer lengths. for example, a change in transactivation score from "4" to "0" with an increase in spacer length corresponds to a 4-fold change.

weak p53-re half-sites show increased transactivation capability when spacer length is reduced
in order to test whether a lower spacer length would increase the predicted capacity of the res with weaker dimers, we tested all possible spacer lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . we selected two validated p <dig> target genes  with a 4-fold change difference when the spacer length was artificially varied for the analysis of implication of spacer length in p53-re transactivation capacity. while the functional p53-re of met not only has mismatches in the core cwwg but also has a spacer of  <dig> bp , trpm <dig> p53-re  has a spacer length of  <dig> bp. interestingly, met p53-re was predicted to have an increased transactivation capability  if the spacer length were artificially reduced to  <dig> or  <dig> bp . likewise, trpm <dig> p53-re was predicted to have a capacity of  <dig>  if the spacer lengths were lower . an alternate example is p53-re of ddr <dig>  , whose predicted transactivation score drops to zero when the spacer length is increased by  <dig> bp! in a recent systematic analysis measuring the ability of the p <dig> to transactivate 1/ <dig> site or 3/ <dig> sites  <cit> , it has been suggested that two weak half-sites may actually be a functional 3/ <dig> site.

strong p53-re half-sites retain high transactivation capability irrespective of spacer length
since p53-res that are in strong agreement with the consensus are known to have higher transactivation capability  <cit> , we selected those res that have a high similarity to the consensus  and predicted the effects of spacer length on their transactivation by varying the spacer length . for instance, the functional p53-re of rrm2b  has catg in both the dimers , and we found that increasing the spacer length does not alter the transactivation significantly. similar results were obtained for target genes ddb <dig> and sema3b . these results are in complete agreement with earlier findings that the effect of spacer is partially overcome by the presence of a strong cwwg core in the dimers  <cit> . list of p <dig> res with 1-fold and 2-fold change in transactivation scores with varying spacer lengths are included as additional files .

implication of snps on p53-re transactivation capability
although several computational approaches exist to predict the impact of coding and non-coding polymorphisms  <cit> , very few take into account the binding affinity of a transcription factor with the response element, let alone predict their impact.

effect of snps overlapping p53-re half-sites
using the p53-res as a test case, we sought to assess the impact of human non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms  on the p53-re transactivation capability. to do this, using the ucsc genome browser  <cit> , we made an intersection of  <dig> validated p53-res and human non-coding snps. there were  <dig> non-coding snps overlapping with a known validated p53-re . of these,  <dig> overlapped with dimers, out of which  <dig> snps were predicted to impact the transactivation capacity by our predictor. for instance, a g>c variation  in the tap <dig> gene , decreased the predicted transactivation score from "3" to " <dig> " the variation alters the "g" of the core motif cwwg in the first dimer to "c" which could result in reduced transactivation capability. a similar result  was obtained when we repeated the analysis using veprintsev's algorithm  <cit> . likewise, a c>g variation  occurring upstream to dcc <dig>  and overlapping a validated p53-re, is predicted to increase the transactivation capability from "2" to " <dig> " the dcc <dig> p53-re has "cag" for the "rrr" in dimer <dig> , which changes to "gag" because of a snp  and could be responsible for increasing the predicted transactivation score. thus, our algorithm is not only sensitive to predict the implications following variations in the core "cwwg" but also to those occurring in the flanking sequences. however, there were some exceptions – for instance, a snp  that overlaps the third purine in the rrr of the second dimer of a validated p53-re. although both the wild-type and minor allele are mismatches to the original p <dig> consensus, our model predicts an increase in the transactivation score from "1" to "2". this could be because of lack of sufficient training data that gives sufficient coverage throughout the entire variation space of the p <dig> consensus. also, as discussed earlier there were only  <dig> p53-res in the training set with spacer lengths greater than  <dig> 

of these,  <dig> snps overlap with dimers, out of which  <dig> snps were predicted to impact the transactivation capacity by our predictor .

effect of indels overlapping p53-re spacer region
for analyzing the effect of indels overlapping spacers on p <dig> res transactivation capability, we used galaxy  <cit>  to obtain the 17-species multiple alignments for both validated p <dig> res. we then used a custom bioinformatics program to assess the level of conservation between species in the two dimers and the spacer separately. indels occurring in the dimer and spacer were noted. we then ran the transactivation capability prediction algorithm on the p <dig> res of each species. this way the level of sequence conservation and transactivation capability between species could be obtained. the algorithm was able to successfully predict differences in transactivation capability. for example, a validated p <dig> re occurring on exon  <dig> of the eef1a <dig> is highly conserved across multiple species. however, subtle differences exist. for instance, the human p53-re has a dimer1+dimer <dig> sequence of "gggcatgctcgggtctgccc" and has a transactivation score of "1". but the corresponding frog sequence has a p <dig> re that has a 20-mer sequence of "gggcatgctcgagtttgtcc" and has a transactivation score of " <dig> " a c>t in the first "w" of the "cwwg" sequence in dimer <dig> results in the transactivation capability increasing by a unit of  <dig> 

we also analyzed those p <dig> res that have insertions or deletions in their spacers among the conserved species and predicted their transactivation capability. for example, a validated p <dig> re in the 5'utr of bcl <dig> has a spacer of length  <dig> and a predicted transactivation score of "1" in the human. when compared to other species, dog has a conserved p <dig> re with a spacer length of  <dig> and a predicted transactivation score of "2" .

CONCLUSIONS
our p53-re transactivation predictor is a useful complementary tool to current algorithms that are based on position-weight-matrices and experimental-based affinity values. through various analyses we have shown that our method performs better than an existing algorithm by veprintsev. we have done initial validation of our method by analyzing known validated p53-res. we have shown the utility of this method as a valuable aid to the existing p53mh algorithm in obtaining high quality novel p53-res. the results indicate that our model can predict the changes in the level of transactivation capability relative to changes in the spacer length. additionally, our results corroborate the current theories on variation of binding affinities relative to spacer lengths. based on our results we hypothesize that a deletion in the spacer  of a low-affinity re could increase its transactivation capability while p53-res with conserved consensus and high transactivation capability are tolerant of longer spacer lengths. we strongly believe that our method will help in prioritizing novel p53-res obtained through various methods including high-throughput chip-chip experiments. lastly, as more p53-re transactivation experimental data becomes available, we anticipate an increase in the accuracy of our model.
