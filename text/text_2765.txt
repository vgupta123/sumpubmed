BACKGROUND
signal transduction plays an essential role in cell response to environment changes. this biological process is usually characterized by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of some key proteins  and generally involves a signal cascade. the signal transduction process often starts from a membrane protein , spans a series of intercellular signaling proteins and then transfers to transcription factors in the nucleus, subsequently raising the expression of downstream genes. studies demonstrate that many important cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle control and cellular responses to nutrient limiting conditions are involved in different signaling pathways  <cit> . for example, yokoi et al  <cit>  demonstrated that hyperglycemia mediates endothelial cell senescence through the ask <dig> signaling pathway. tang et al  <cit>  showed that the receptor kinase bri <dig> and br-signaling kinases  mediate growth regulation related signal transduction in arabidopsis. the toll-like receptor  signaling cascade plays an essential role in recognizing and eliciting responses upon invasion of pathogens  <cit> . recent high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques, such as large-scale yeast two-hybrid   <cit> , co-immunoprecipitation   <cit> , tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry   <cit> , protein chip  <cit>  and microarray experiments  <cit>  have generated enormous amounts of data for uncovering signal transduction networks. this abundance of information brings increasing complexity to network analysis, which is a major obstacle to understanding the mechanisms of cell signaling.

recently, computational methods have been introduced in mining signal transduction network. steffen et al  <cit>  developed a static model, netsearch, to reconstruct the signal transduction network from ppi and gene expression data. for a given membrane protein and transcription factor, netsearch will search for all possible linear paths that link the two proteins. by employing a depth first search  algorithm  <cit> , paths of a specified length are kept, and then a statistical score is assigned to each path. top scoring pathways are then assembled into the final branched signal transduction network. liu et al  <cit>  have worked on determining the order of signal transduction network components. they calculated the correlations between each gene pair and recorded the significance using a hypergeometric test to specify the correlation threshold. a score function is constructed to determine the final signal transduction network. zhao et al  <cit>  proposed a novel computational approach aimed at finding an optimal signal transduction network using an integer linear programming  and mixed integer linear programming  model. similar approaches have also been proposed in more recent studies  <cit> . all those existing methods mainly use integrated ppi and gene expression data, which have been widely adopted in many related studies. they all aim at finding an optimal signal transduction network starting from a given membrane receptor and ending at a specific transcription factor. however, in most situations, we even do not know which membrane receptor or transcription factor is involved in a certain signaling pathway. in fact, most intermediate proteins are more easily available for their dominant position in quantity, which is neither a membrane receptor or transcription factor. these proteins could also be used in mining signal transduction networks. besides, the datasets utilized in these methods are primarily based on experiments. though the interactions are more reliable compared with computationally predicted interactions, the data is deficient. some computational methods, e.g. gene co-expression  <cit>  and semantic similarity of gene ontology  annotations  <cit> , indicate that genes with high scored interactions may be involved in the same signaling pathway  <cit> . however, this information either is limited or has not been incorporated in most databases constructed from experimental data. though these interactions may not necessarily be direct interactions, using this information may help to improve prediction of signal transduction networks. we define "direct interaction" as a direct physical association between two proteins and "indirect interaction" as no direct physical association between two proteins in the actual state. two proteins with indirect interaction must function through at least one medial protein.

here, we present a novel computational method, named cascade_scan, under linux system, to detect signal transduction networks from high-throughput data based on a customized steepest descent method   <cit> . we do not mean to find a signal transduction network starting and ending from two specific proteins, but to find a high scored network within the top largest densities that contain a series of given proteins, also referred to as seed proteins, which are the supposed known components of a specific signaling pathway. these given proteins may also include the membrane receptor and the transcription factor. in addition, by searching for additional high related proteins automatically, indirect interactions are used effectively. this pre-processing is demonstrated below to be very useful. the well studied yeast mapk signaling pathways , which have been widely used in previous studies, were also employed here to test our model. all figures were generated by cytoscape  <cit> . the results indicate that the precision and recall values are comparable with those of other existing methods, even though the dataset we used is much larger than those previously utilized.

RESULTS
since the yeast mapk pathways have been well studied and widely used as reference standards in previous studies  <cit> , we thus used those pathways  downloaded from the kegg database  <cit>  to validate the reliability of cascade_scan. in the following steps, we discuss the results of the pheromone response and the filamentous growth pathway, respectively. it is worth noting that the seed proteins we used were not restricted to membrane receptors and transcription factors, as in previous studies.

detecting the pheromone response pathway
the pheromone response pathway  mediates cell signaling in response to extracellular peptide pheromones. in the current kegg database, there are about twenty proteins present in the pheromone response pathway, as shown in figure 2a. we randomly selected four seed proteins and varied the score threshold from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an interval of  <dig> . different parameters were tested . table  <dig> shows the results of the performance evaluation mentioned above compared with other methods . we can see that cascade_scan obtains ~76% recall after  <dig> independent experiments, which is comparable with color-coding, netsearch and pathfinder, though the ~54% precision is lower . the p-values detected by both the hypergeometric test and fisher's exact test from david are less than or equal to  <dig> e- <dig> , indicating the effectiveness of our method.

the results of cascade_scan were obtained from  <dig> independent experiments using four seed proteins . note, the results of color-coding algorithm, netsearch, pathfinder and ilp were obtained from zhao's paper.

note: "nan" is beyond the computer's capability.

we note, however, that some of those proteins not in the kegg pheromone response signaling pathway were also detected by some of the other methods . for example, kss <dig>  was also presented in the pheromone response pathway by our method . in a previous study, kss <dig>  together with fus <dig>  was demonstrated to regulate the signal transduction cascade of the pheromone response and filamentous growth pathways  <cit> . kss <dig> also activates the transcription factor ste <dig> as well as phosphorylates dig <dig>  dig <dig> and ste <dig>  which are involved in both the pheromone response and filamentous growth pathways  <cit> . moreover, kss <dig> was also detected by all of the other four methods. cla <dig> is a member of the ste <dig> subfamily, which belongs to the ste ser/thr protein kinase family. cla <dig> may play a role in the phosphorylation of alpha-factor-arrested yeast  <cit> . ste <dig> was reported to interact with the mapkkk ste <dig> through the respective sam domain  <cit> , and is required in growth arrest during conjugation at an early step in yeast mating  <cit> . we, therefore, can draw the conclusion that those proteins indeed have some association with the yeast pheromone response pathway, though they are not included in the kegg pheromone response pathway.

bni <dig>  which was not detected by most of the other methods , was also not detected by cascade_scan. this may be because it has both weaker and fewer interactions with other proteins in this pathway, which may also have been the case for the other proteins ste <dig>  ste <dig>  msg <dig> and mcm <dig> 

detecting the filamentous growth pathway
the filamentous growth pathway  regulates cellular response to nutrient limiting conditions. for this pathway , there are many common proteins with other mapk pathways . so, we randomly selected three or four seed proteins only from ssu <dig>  tec <dig>  ras <dig> and kss <dig>  different parameters were also tested . after five independent experiments, we obtained an average of ~89% recall and ~36% precision . table  <dig> shows the performance of cascade_scan in detecting the filamentous growth pathway compared with that of netsearch, pathfinder and ilp. cascade_scan clearly shows both higher recall and precision than all the other methods. in addition, the p-values detected by both the hypergeometric test and fisher's exact test from david are less than or equal to  <dig> e- <dig> , indicating that our method is effective.

the results cascade_scan were obtained from four independent experiments using three seed proteins, and one experiment for four seed proteins. . note, the results of color-coding algorithm, netsearch, pathfinder and ilp were obtained from zhao's paper.

detecting the cell wall remodeling and high osmolarity pathways
we also evaluated the cell wall remodeling  and high osmolarity  mapk pathways. these two kegg pathways are shown in figure 4a and 5a. after  <dig> independent experiments by randomly selected three seed proteins each time, cascade_scan obtained ~69% recall and ~21% precision for the cell wall remodeling pathway , and ~77% recall and ~20% precision for the high osmolarity pathway , using a default network size threshold of  <dig>  though the recall values are relatively high , the precision seems to be very low. generally speaking, the more complex the organism is, the more components a signaling pathway contains. through our investigation of all the kegg signaling pathways, the number of signaling pathway components usually does not exceed  <dig> in higher organisms , and  <dig> in relatively lower organisms . therefore, we also evaluated the two pathways with a network size threshold of  <dig>  cascade_scan obtained ~64% recall and ~32% precision for the cell wall remodeling pathway , and ~82% recall and ~39% precision for the high osmolarity pathway, showing significant improvement in the precision at a relative high level. moreover, all of the p-values are less than or equal to  <dig> e- <dig>  and  <dig> e- <dig> , respectively, indicating that our method is effective.

the results cascade_scan were obtained from  <dig> independent experiments using three seed proteins. . note, the results of netsearch and ilp were obtained from zhao's paper.

figures 4b and 5b show the results of the cell wall remodeling and the high osmolarity pathways detected by cascade_scan. as we can see in the figures, most components of the two pathways are detected by cascade_scan. however, the integrated database contains many more interactions, so several other proteins were also detected. in addition, cascade_scan seems to predict fewer edges between the proteins in the predicted signal transduction networks comparing with other methods. hence, even though the membrane receptor and transcription factor are not known, we still know where the signal is from and to among those proteins, since most proteins have only one link to the preceding and succeeding element in the predicted network. in fact, if we require the order between the proteins to be more intuitive, fewer edges should be kept in the predicted network. we achieved this goal by maximizing the average weight of the network while keeping most of the reliable interactions, as described by equation .

discussion
generally, some potential proteins involved in a signaling pathway stimulated by environmental factors are easily available through various reliable means, such as manual literature curation and biological experiments. but in most situations, not all or none of these proteins are membrane receptors or transcription factors. moreover, the proteins we obtained may be more than just two proteins . therefore, cascade_scan is more suitable for actual biological application compared with existing methods such as color-coding, netsearch, pathfinder and ilp. nevertheless, although those methods utilize a more reliable dataset, the data is limited. however, using computationally predicted interactions may make up for the deficiency of experiment data, which is also one of our original aims.

in addition, we used a different but both a reasonable and effective data pre-processing scheme for cascade_scan. firstly, we used a customized dfs algorithm to search for common nodes within a certain path length. we found that, in the integrated database  and biological general repository for interaction datasets  databases), more than 90% nodes can link with any other nodes within a six-path length, and proteins in the same pathway often within a two-path length, which is different from the previously reported 6- <dig> steps. this is primarily because the integrated database stores many more indirect ppis that were primarily generated by computational methods. the indirect interaction weights are often lower than the direct interaction weights but much higher than the weights between two unrelated nodes. therefore, the path length between any two nodes would become correspondingly shorter, and we used a relatively shorter path length for the dfs algorithm here. secondly, proteins involved in the same signaling pathway usually have a similar gene expression profile, so there are usually more and stronger interactions among them than others in the integrated database. and vice versa, many computationally predicted and high scored ppis also indicate that the corresponding proteins may be involved in the same signaling pathway. our approach--searching for additional seed proteins--was based on this hypothesis. when detecting the pheromone response pathway, by providing only four seed proteins, cdc <dig>  dig <dig>  far <dig> and ste <dig>  seven other proteins were detected in the pre-processing step , including cdc <dig>  bem <dig>  ste <dig>  ste <dig>  fus <dig>  ste <dig> and ste <dig>  all of which are in the kegg pheromone response pathway. when determining the filamentous growth pathway, by only giving three seed proteins kss <dig>  ras <dig> and ssu <dig>  three other proteins including fus <dig>  ste <dig> and ste <dig> were detected in the pre-processing step , of which ste <dig> and ste <dig> are in the kegg filamentous growth pathway except for fus <dig>  in all, these pre-processing schemes were demonstrated to be effective in inferring signaling pathways when using the integrated database.

recent studies have indicated that genes involved in the same signaling pathway tend to have similar gene expression profiles, which is especially notable regarding adjacent pathway components  <cit> . moreover, signal transduction usually shows different activation under different situations  <cit> . based on those hypotheses, microarray expression data  <cit>  were employed in previous studies as a complement to ppi data. recently, studies have reported that using fold change criterions in the pre-processing schemes removes genes without significant change  <cit> . however, this process may also eliminate some important genes without significant quantity change in mrna level, but showing activity changes in protein level. therefore, fold change was not incorporated in this study. however, fold change criterion of gene expression data could be easily incorporated into the filtering process. besides, an appropriately bigger score threshold, a relatively shorter dfs path length and a more stricter ppi scoring system would be helpful for excluding most irrelevant proteins as well as most indirect interactions.

when we attempted to compare the results of color-coding, netsearch, pathfinder and ilp obtained from zhao's paper  <cit> , we found the results are actually incomparable because we used a different dataset and method. firstly, the integrated dataset we used contained  <dig>  yeast proteins and  <dig>  yeast protein interactions, much larger than the previously used dataset. moreover, most of these interactions are indirect interactions, while the previously used dataset contains mostly direct interactions. secondly, the seed proteins used in our method are not confined to membrane receptors or transcription factors, and are usually more than just two proteins. using different seed proteins may also lead to different precision and recall values. therefore, it is difficult to say which method is better. furthermore, the ppi scoring system is of the most importance, for which we combined the topological clustering semantic similarity  scoring and string scoring systems. the tcss scoring system predicts ppi from semantic similarity based on go annotations  <cit> . the string scoring system method predicts ppi from various methods, such as the neighbourhood method, fusion events, co-occurrence, co-expression, experimental methods and text-mining. the combined scoring system seems to be stricter, and may be one of the reasons for our better performance. nevertheless, we still recommend using other methods as complements for predicting signal transduction networks because no single method is perfect. more work needs to be done in this field as well as controlling for network size.

we note that the precision values are much lower for the other three pathways  compared to the pheromone response pathway. this is primarily because most proteins in each of the other three pathways also have strong interactions with other proteins that are in other pathways. therefore, more proteins are predicted than for the other three pathways. for instance, cdc <dig>  ste <dig>  ste <dig>  ste <dig>  dig <dig>  dig <dig> and ste <dig> in the filamentous growth pathway could interact with bem <dig>  pbs <dig>  fus <dig>  mcm <dig>  ste <dig>  ste <dig>  ste <dig> and cdc <dig> in the pheromone response pathway, ste <dig> could interact with pbs <dig> in the high osmolyte pathway, and ras <dig> could interact with cyr <dig> in the meiosis pathway. this is the sharing proteins phenomenon as mentioned in previous studies  <cit> . though all the methods predicted mostly true proteins, i.e., with high recall values, the other three pathways contain fewer proteins than the pheromone response pathway. thus, the precision for determining these signal transduction networks is relatively lower. another reason may be there is less sufficient ppi information available for the other three pathways compared with the well studied pheromone response pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we reported a new method, named cascade_scan, to detect signal transduction networks from high-throughput data. a new tool based on this method is freely available from the website http://www.genomescience.com.cn/cascade_scan/. different from previous methods, in cascade_scan, the sdm is employed for inferring the signal transduction network and the given proteins utilized are not confined to membrane receptors or transcription factors. we also demonstrated that indirect interactions  can be effectively used in mining signaling transduction networks. this is particularly useful because all databases will include more and more indirect interactions as the data accumulates.
