BACKGROUND
the optimization of the production of secreted proteins, such as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies , is still a challenging problem in pharmaceutical biotechnology. although biopharmaceutical products can be produced by many host cell systems, eukaryotic cells are preferred due to their ability to correctly process and modify human proteins. the primary goal is to establish the ideal combination of a rapid accumulation of productive biomass and the maintenance of cell viability for as long as possible. many different strategies have been considered for improving both cell viability and the productivity of recombinant proteins, including mabs. these strategies include physiological optimization and genetic and metabolic engineering  <cit> .

the most common problem during the optimization of protein production is an error in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum . the inhibition of protein folding activates the unfolded protein response , which is a signal transduction network. overcoming upr is one of the many strategies for optimizing protein productivity. for instance, protein production has been tested under the expression of survival proteins that play important roles in upr, including b-cell lymphoma protein  <dig> , b-cell lymphoma-extra-large protein   <cit> , caspase inhibitors  <cit>  and molecular chaperones/heat shock proteins   <cit> . the role of the spliced form of x-box binding protein )  in optimizing protein production has also been studied  <cit> . this approach to increasing the secretion capacity of mammalian cells by overexpressing the transcription factor xbp- <dig> was successful in cho cells; the production of the secreted proteins alkaline phosphatase  and alpha-amylase  was enhanced upon xbp- <dig> overexpression  <cit> , as was the production of antibody  <cit> . however, these studies have shown that using overexpression systems without regulation leads to cell apoptosis due to the accumulation of the produced proteins  <cit> .

to overcome accumulation-induced apoptosis, other strategies have been applied to regulate the protein production, such as the use of induction systems. for instance, tetracycline has been used to optimize the overexpression of glycosyltransferases under the control of the tet on/off system in cho cells, but unfortunately, a high expression of glycosyltransferases still led to growth inhibition  <cit> . furthermore, interesting work using the same expression system has been conducted to control the overexpression of human transferrin  in human embryonic kidney  cells. that study found favorable concentrations of tetracycline at which the overexpression of htf was optimal, but again, the high levels of expression limited the cell viability. such impairment might have been a consequence of the overexpression of the protein of interest, which might have altered the quality of this cell product or even been toxic to the cells  <cit> . some studies have attempted to investigate the effect of the expression of an er-resident molecular chaperone, protein disulfide isomerase , on the specific production levels of thrombopoietin  and antibody  in chinese hamster ovary cells. mohan and colleagues used the tet-off system  to regulate pdi, tpo and ab expression in cho cells under doxycycline  induction. however, only a small increase in antibody production was observed, and the production of tpo was not affected by pdi expression  <cit> .

moreover, the optimization of protein production in cho cells cultured at different temperatures has been addressed. for instance, lowering the temperature from 37°c to 33°c increased the production of erythropoietin  by approximately four-fold, but at the same time, a low cultivation temperature suppressed cell growth  <cit> . in addition, a temperature reduction from 37°c to 33°c in the culture of a cho cell line producing recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor  led to a reduced growth rate, increased cell viability, improved cellular protein production and decreased cell metabolism  <cit> . one study on the optimization of protein production at 32°c also demonstrated that the specific growth rate of cho cells producing human mab decreased by 30–63% at 32°c compared to 37°c. however, the specific antibody productivity of these cells was significantly enhanced at 32°c  <cit> . lowering the cultivation temperature even more, from 37°c to 30°c, caused growth arrest associated with a  <dig> -fold increase in the specific production of secreted alkaline phosphatase  in cho cells  <cit> .

in this context, we attempted to optimize the specific igg productivity under different culture temperatures and by regulating the overexpression of apoptotic human protein xbp- <dig> using the t-rex™ system . the applied t-rex™ system contains a regulatory plasmid , which encodes the tetracycline repressor, and an inducible expression plasmid  with a tetracycline inductor for expression of the gene of the interest ). co-transfected together, these plasmids created a network to regulate xbp- <dig> expression under dox induction. we cloned xbp- <dig> into the t-rex™ system to control its expression with dox. then, we transfected the obtained t-rex™-xbp- <dig> system into stably igg-producing cho cells and selected stable clones of this system expressing igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> to control specific igg productivity under dox induction . we determined the optimal concentration of dox and the temperature at which igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells produced the maximal amount of igg without a significant inhibition of cell growth. moreover, cells treated with dox for seven days recovered viable cell density to the level of non-treated cells after dox was washed out from the cell system, and their specific igg productivity dropped to the basal level. furthermore, we studied the dependence of specific igg productivity and viable cell density on the overexpression of xbp- <dig> and er size expansion.

RESULTS
viability and igg production under induction with dox in igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells cultivated at 37°c and 30°c
to establish a dox-regulated xbp- <dig> cell line, we first created stably igg-producing clones of cho cells by transfecting the pcomires hil anti-cd <dig> plasmid into cho-k <dig> cells. then, igg-cho clones selected with 800 μg/ml of geneticin were co-transfected with the t-rex-xbp- <dig> system and processed for second selection using  <dig>  μg/ml of blasticidin and 50 μg/ml of zeocin. from these double clones harboring both pcomires hil anti-cd <dig> and t-rex-xbp- <dig> system plasmids, we chose one out of  <dig> for dox induction at different concentrations ,  <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  μg/ml or 1 μg/ml) and grew them at 37°c or 30°c. every day, cells were collected to monitor viable cell density. we found that the viable cell density of the igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells grown at 37°c under 1 μg/ml or  <dig>  μg/ml dox was slightly lower compared to the control and to the cells with  <dig>  μg/ml dox induction . moreover, the viable cell density of igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells grown at 37°c without dox or with  <dig>  μg/ml dox was  <dig> -fold higher compared to the cells grown at 30°c . these data agree with several previous studies  <cit> . moreover, the viable cell density of igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells grown at 37°c under 1 μg/ml dox induction was increased by  <dig> % compared to cells incubated at 30°c under the same dox concentration . thus, igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells grew more slowly at 30°c with or without dox compared to those at 37°c.

the supernatants from all cells were collected after seven days of induction and tested by elisa to determine their igg yields. the specific igg productivity depended on the concentration of dox: under  <dig>  μg/ml and 1 μg/ml dox, the increase of specific igg productivity was 40% and 66%, respectively, compared to the basal level of specific igg productivity  at 37°c . these data demonstrate that igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells produced three-fold more igg compared to untreated cells, even at low viable cell density. at  <dig>  μg/ml dox, there was no improvement in specific igg productivity at 37°c. moreover, the data from elisa indicate that protein production in the cells incubated at 30°c increased four-fold and three-fold under 1 μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml dox, respectively. once more, induction at a low concentration of dox  did not increase specific igg productivity at 30°c, as above at 37°c. in contrast, the specific igg productivity by igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells at 30°c increased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % compared to induction at 37°c under 1 μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml dox concentrations, respectively . however, we did not detect any effect of low temperature on specific igg productivity per se . tigges and fussenegger  <cit>  reported the same lack of effect in cho cells expressing seap, whereas other authors reported an increase in the production of different proteins at low temperature and with no inductor  <cit> . these deviations in experimental results may be due to differences in the proteins and cell lines used in these studies. in conclusion, our data demonstrate a successful improvement of specific igg productivity using 1 μg/ml dox in igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells at 30°c.

effect of xbp- <dig> expression and er size expansion on protein production in igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells
to test the hypothesis that xbp- <dig> expression and er size expansion indirectly regulate protein production, igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells were incubated under different concentrations of dox for seven days at 30°c, and then the same cells were washed with dox-free medium and incubated for seven more days at the same temperature in fresh dox-free medium. the supernatant was collected before wash-out and after seven days of incubation in dox-free medium and processed for elisa. elisa showed that specific igg productivity by cells with dox  increased in a dox concentration-dependent manner. the specific igg productivity by cells incubated with 1 μg/ml dox and  <dig>  μg/ml dox reached four-fold and three-fold that of the untreated cells , figure 3a). in addition, elisa demonstrated that after dox removal, the specific igg productivity returned to the basal level  figure 3a). moreover, viability analysis indicated that the growth of the igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells under different concentrations of dox was slightly inhibited , figure 3b) and then restored to the same level , figure 3b) as cells that had never been exposed to dox , figure 3b). in addition, igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells were used to prepare nuclear extracts, which were analyzed by western blotting for the immune detection of xbp . human xbp- <dig>  was overexpressed in a dox concentration-dependent manner  figure 3c), but it was absent in cells that were washed and incubated in dox-free medium for seven days , figure 3c).

er expansion was also observed by flow cytometry. the fluorescence change of er-tracker™ was used as a measure of er size expansion. in this analysis, cell staining was more intense in samples treated with 1 μg/ml or  <dig>  μg/ml dox for seven days , figure 4a) than in those treated with  <dig>  μg/ml , figure 4a) or 0 μg/ml or those that were washed out , figure 4b). moreover, the signal from the washed out cells was equal among different conditions , figure 4b), which indicated that dox was responsible for a cascade of processes leading to er size expansion. in addition, measurements of the median fluorescence intensity  obtained from facs analysis showed that the mfi of the cells treated with 1 μg/ml or  <dig>  μg/ml dox was  <dig> -fold or  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than the mfi of non-treated cells or washed out cells . thus, cells under dox induction and low temperature grew more slowly but, at the same time, exhibited a greater increase in specific igg productivity. our data also demonstrate that the wash-out of dox from the cells restored their viable cell density but reduced their specific igg productivity to basal levels. taken together, our results indicate the optimal conditions for specific igg productivity under dox induction. xbp- <dig> was overexpressed under induction with dox, which led to the er size expansion, and this resulted in an increase of specific igg productivity/secretion. our findings corroborate the data obtained by tigges and fussenegger, who reported an increased production of seap and samy under the expression of xbp- <dig> and the expansion of er and golgi  <cit> .

binding activity of the recombinant proteins produced at different temperatures
to assess its binding activity, the recombinant igg produced by cells at different temperatures  was purified and tested for its ability to recognize cd <dig> at the cell surface of raji cells that were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. facs analysis indicated no significant difference in the binding activity of igg produced by igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells at different temperatures under dox induction from commercial igg  . moreover, protein samples obtained from the igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells at different temperatures under dox induction were submitted to western blotting analysis, and the results did not suggest any differences in structural integrity of igg produced at different temperatures . these data support the use of low-temperature culture conditions under induction by dox to increase protein production without eliminating the binding activity and structural integrity of the protein of interest.

establishing a stable protein-producing cell line
to establish a stable cell line, igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells were seeded and grown at 30°c under 1 μg/ml dox  for 42 days. the supernatant was collected every seventh day and submitted to elisa, which showed stable specific igg productivity around an average of  <dig>  ng/ <dig> cells/ml by cells incubated with dox compared to the basal level  . moreover, the viable cell density of igg-t-rex-xbp- <dig> cells under 1 μg/ml dox was lower than cells without dox for 42 days , which allowed cells to be kept in the same culture flask without passaging to new flasks. the described approach might be useful for the production of recombinant secreted proteins, as cells growing under the combination of dox induction and low temperature multiply more slowly but are more productive.

CONCLUSIONS
many studies have been published on improving recombinant protein production. in general, the published data suggest that the optimization of the production of specific target proteins requires specifically adjusted growth conditions and a carefully chosen cell line. in the present study, we optimized the conditions for igg  specific productivity in cho-k <dig> cells. we showed that the combination of low temperature  and xbp- <dig> overexpression regulated by dox induction significantly improved anti-cd <dig> specific productivity: under 1 μg/ml dox treatment, specific igg productivity was increased by 32% compared to the cells grown under the same concentration at 37°c and 74% compared to the cells grown without dox induction at 37°c or 30°c. moreover, the results of our study indicate the direct dependence of specific igg productivity on the concentration of dox , which allows for the precise regulation of specific igg productivity in cho-k <dig> cells. in addition to the concentration dependence, we demonstrated the possibility of returning the specific igg over productivity to the basal level of specific productivity by removing dox. this step also restored the viable cell density, which permitted the cells to overcome the problem of accumulation of the target protein. in the production of proteins, it may be possible to use the t-rex-xbp- <dig> system to turn up and down the production of protein, repeating this cycle several times to accumulate higher amounts of target protein without a loss of cell viability. we also observed a dox concentration-dependent relationship involving xbp- <dig> overexpression , er size expansion  and specific igg productivity . finally, our data demonstrate that it is possible, under dox induction at low temperature, to produce a target protein for an extended period of time. taken together, our data suggest the t-rex-xbp- <dig> system can be used in cho-k <dig> cells for human immunoglobulin production.
