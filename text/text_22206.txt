BACKGROUND
leguminous plants can establish mutually beneficial associations with soil n2-fixing bacteria, mainly belonging to the rhizobiacea family   <cit> . this remarkable biological process culminates in the formation of specialized organs, the symbiotic nodules, where the n <dig> fixation process takes place. the legume-rhizobium interaction initiates with an exchange of molecular signals, a chemical dialog that leads to mutual recognition, the attachment of the bacteria to the plant root hairs, and the formation of the nodule meristem. rhizobia invade plant roots via an infection thread made of plant material while a nodule primordium is simultaneously induced in the root cortex. bacteria are released from infection threads into the cytoplasm of primordium cells by endocytosis and become surrounded by a plant-derived membrane, the peribacteroid membrane . the pbm is a physical and dynamic barrier between rhizobia and the cell's cytoplasm. inside the hosting cell, the bacteria multiply, undergo a dramatic differentiation process including extreme cell enlargement, and finally become specialized n2-fixing bacteroids  <cit> . in fully developed bean nodules, two major tissues can be recognized: the peripheral tissue and the central tissue. whereas the central tissue is composed mainly of large infected cells intercalated with smaller, vacuolated uninfected cells, the peripheral tissue includes: from the outside to the inside, the outer cortex, the nodule endodermis, and the inner cortex , which contains the vascular bundles  <cit> .

several plant proteins involved in this symbiotic process show a specific or enhanced expression pattern in root nodules. these proteins are collectively termed nodulins and have been classified as early or late nodulins according to the timing of their expression during root nodule development  <cit> . in general, early nodulins are involved in initial signaling events, infection development, and nodule organogenesis, whereas late nodulins, which are induced just before or during the onset of the n <dig> fixation process, are involved mainly in nodule metabolism and function.

large-scale transcriptome analyses conducted in the last decade have enabled the identification of plant peptidases whose expressions are up-regulated during rhizobium infection, nodule development and/or senescence  <cit> , suggesting roles for these proteins in the symbiotic process.

peptidases cleave covalent peptide bonds of proteins or peptides  <cit> , an essential post-translational modification that alters the half-lives, subcellular trafficking and activities of a wide array of proteins  <cit> . in consequence, peptidases are potentially involved in a multitude of biological processes ranging from simple digestion of proteins to highly-regulated signaling cascades.

plant aspartic peptidases , a relatively small class of endopeptidases, are composed of either one or two chains  <cit> . their catalytic centre is formed by two asp residues that activate a water molecule, and this event mediates the nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond  <cit> . enzymes of this group are active at acidic ph and are generally inhibited by pepstatin a  <cit> . although the biological function of most plant aps remains hypothetical, these enzymes have been implicated in protein processing and/or degradation, plant senescence and programmed cell death, stress responses, and reproduction  <cit> .

aps are synthesized as inactive precursors , in which a hydrophobic n-terminal signal sequence is followed by a prosegment of about  <dig> amino acids. finally, the n- and c-terminal domains are separated by an insertion of  <dig> amino acids, a plant-specific insert  present exclusively in most plant aps  <cit> .

a small number of plant aps do not contain a psi and in consequence have been cataloged as "atypical aps": nucellin and pcs <dig>  involved in cell death regulation  <cit> , cnd <dig> and nepenthesins i and ii  involved in nitrogen remobilization  <cit> , and cdr <dig> , involved in disease resistance  <cit> . despite having low sequence identity among them, plant atypical aps contain a high number of cysteines and show specific localizations, which clearly differentiate them from the majority of plant aps  <cit> .

in this study, we report the isolation and characterization of pvnod <dig>  a novel aspartic peptidase from common bean  that can be classified as a plant atypical ap. pvnod <dig> shows peptidase activity against casein at mildly acidic ph and is only partially inhibited by pepstatin a. sequence analysis of pvnod <dig> revealed that it is closely related to cdr <dig>  an atypical arabidopsis ap involved in pathogen defense. considering its biochemical properties, as well as its restricted spatial and temporal expression pattern in uninfected cells of the symbiotic nodule, pvnod <dig> could play an important role in plant defense during nodule development.

RESULTS
purification of nodulin  <dig>  and determination of its primary structure
pvnod <dig> was first detected in an attempt to isolate root nodule proteins able to interact with a synthetic peptide derived from the amino acid sequence of nodulin  <dig>  <cit> . after several interaction assays employing different experimental conditions, we realized that pvnod <dig> was binding to denatured polypeptides. accordingly, a method to purify pvnod <dig> from common bean root nodules was developed, based on a denatured bsa-affinity chromatography column, followed by affi-gel heparin gel chromatography . 12% sds-page analysis of the purified protein fraction confirmed the presence of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda. the fraction containing pvnod <dig> , was collected and used for amino acid sequencing, interaction assays and proteolytic activity assays. the calculated purification factor from the crude extract was 250-fold.

the identity of pvnod <dig> was partially determined by edman degradation from purified trypsin-digested peptides . all of the partial amino acid sequences of pvnod <dig> were further identified in different expressed sequence tags  of common bean , a fact that allowed us to deduce a virtually complete gene sequence, depicted in detail in figure  <dig>  two primers were designed to amplify pvnod <dig> by pcr. a single ~ <dig>  kb pcr amplification product was obtained using either genomic dna or cdna of common bean as template, indicating that this gene contains no introns. the pvnod <dig> gene  encodes a  <dig> amino acid plant ap  composed of a single polypeptide chain belonging to the a1b subfamily  <cit> . the two catalytic sequence motifs in aps  are present in the primary sequence of pvnod <dig> , as is a putative signal peptide of  <dig> amino acids likely to be responsible for its translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . by comparing the deduced amino acid sequence of the pvnod <dig> genomic clone and the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the pvnod <dig> purified protein, it became evident that the  <dig> amino acid prosegment had been removed . well-known representatives of the a <dig> peptidase family are generally secreted from cells as inactive zymogens that activate autocatalytically at acidic ph to yield the active peptidase  <cit> . as we could not find any intermediate form during the purification process , the  <dig> amino acid n-terminal prosegment of pvnod <dig> is likely removed by autocatalysis  <cit> .

a phylogenetic analysis was carried out including selected plant ap sequences representing different groups within the a1b subfamily. four phytepsins belonging to the a1a subfamily, which are aps with rather different amino acid sequences, were included as an outgroup. based on this analysis, pvnod41's most closely related protein is cdr <dig> , an ap involved in resistance to pathogens in arabidopsis and rice  <cit>  , whereas the other aps were found in different clades .

preferential binding of pvnod <dig> to denatured proteins and peptidase activity
in order to determine its binding preferences, pvnod <dig> was incubated with native or denatured model substrates. as shown in figure 4a, pvnod <dig> preferentially bound to the denatured forms of bsa, lysozyme and α2-macroglobulin, whereas it bound to denatured and native casein to equivalent levels. pvnod <dig> was unable to bind to an unstructured protein such as gelatin, a mixture of peptides and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen generally used to evaluate peptidase activity. pvnod41's binding preferences for denatured or native bsa and casein were confirmed in far western blot assays .

although purified pvnod <dig> selectively bound to denatured proteins, no peptidase activity was detected on bsa or gelatin at ph  <dig>  . however, pvnod <dig> was able to degrade casein in both conformational states  . the optimal ph of pvnod <dig> catalytic activity was determined on casein, a classic protease substrate . pvnod <dig> was found to be most active at ph  <dig>  in the assays, although it maintains residual activity at a wider range of ph values . similar data were also obtained by using a chromogenic method that employs succinylated casein as a substrate . the maximum activity detected by this method was at ph  <dig>  .

n.c. not cleaved.

proteolytic activity of purified pvnod <dig> was tested against several model substrates. the assays were performed as described in "methods". efficiency of cleavage was compared to that of trypsin.

the effects of distinct class-specific inhibitors of known peptidases on pvnod <dig> activity were studied and the results are shown in table  <dig>  none of the ap inhibitors used could completely abolish the hydrolytic activity of pvnod <dig> on casein. inhibition in response to pepstatin a  was partial, as was that of 2-mercaptoethanol and fe3+. the effect of sds, known to stimulate peptidase activity, was also deleterious. as expected, edta, an inhibitor of metallopeptidase activity, had no effect on pvnod <dig> 

purified pvnod <dig> was tested for activity using casein as a substrate in  <dig> mm sodium citrate, ph  <dig>  at 37°c. the enzyme was preincubated in the presence of the indicated inhibitor for  <dig> min at 37°c before adding the substrate.

pvnod <dig> expression pattern in different bean organs and immunolocalization in root nodules
a specific antiserum raised in mouse against purified pvnod <dig> detected a single  <dig> kda band in a crude extract of root nodule proteins, but no signal was detected in similar extracts from roots, nodule-stripped roots, stems, or leaves , confirming that pvnod <dig> is indeed a nodulin. the temporal expression pattern of pvnod <dig> during root nodule development was also investigated. no signal was detected in 3-d-old uninoculated roots,  <dig> days post-inoculation  nodule-stripped roots, or  <dig> dpi root nodules . pvnod <dig> was just barely detected in  <dig> dpi root nodules, and accumulated in  <dig> to  <dig> dpi root nodules . based on the fact that pvnod <dig> shows a late developmental expression pattern during root nodule development, correlating with other late nodulins such as leghemoglobin and uricase ii  <cit> , this protein should be considered a late nodulin. additionally, pvnod <dig> transcript accumulation levels were determined by rt-qpcr. pvnod <dig> transcripts were found in  <dig> to  <dig> dpi root nodules, whereas no transcripts were detected in  <dig> d-old uninoculated roots.  <dig> dpi nodule-stripped roots contained a lower amount of transcript than did root nodules .

since the bean root nodule is formed by different tissues, each composed of particular cell types, we wanted to know if pvnod <dig> is expressed in different cells throughout the root nodule or only in a particular cell type. the anti-pvnod <dig> antiserum was used to specifically detect pvnod <dig> in root nodule sections by laser scanning confocal microscopy. the pvnod <dig> signal was restricted to the central tissue of mature nodules , specifically in uninfected cells . pvnod <dig> signal was not associated with the cell wall, plasma membrane, or vacuole . instead, this protease displayed a punctate subcellular distribution that could be indicative of the endomembrane system. interestingly, the distribution pattern of pvnod <dig> within the cell  is similar to that of pcs <dig>  an atypical ap of arabidopsis thaliana that is localized to the er  <cit> .

discussion
proteolytic enzymes are usually associated with nutrient remobilization during starvation, and senescence, stress responses, and differentiation of cell components  <cit> . however, novel findings on plant peptidase functions have revealed their involvement in a broad range of inducible cellular processes  <cit> .

a variety of up-regulated genes encoding members of the large peptidase family have been discovered during all stages of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis  <cit> , suggesting that peptidases may play an important role in the symbiotic process. indeed, rhizobium-induced peptidases have been isolated from various nodulating plants. mtmmpl <dig>  a medicago truncatula matrix metalloendoproteinase has been shown to be involved in the sinorhizobium meliloti infection process  <cit> . cg <dig>  a subtilisin-like serine peptidase gene from casuarina glauca, was shown to be specifically expressed during plant cell infections induced by sinorhizobium meliloti in transgenic medicago truncatula plants  <cit> , whereas sbts, a lotus japonicus serine peptidase of the subtilase superfamily, is transiently expressed during the first two weeks after inoculation with mesorhizobium loti and is proposed to be involved in nodule formation and maintenance  <cit> . cysteine peptidases have been implicated in molecular processes such as defense against root invasion by soil microorganisms, protein turnover to create new tissues, cellular homeostasis, and metabolism  <cit> . in addition, some of them have been identified in the cytoplasm of infected nodule cells and their activity appears to increase markedly during senescence  <cit> .

in this work we describe a novel nodulin that has aspartic peptidase  activity and is expressed exclusively in nitrogen-fixing root nodules during the symbiosis of phaseolus vulgaris with rhizobia . even though ap activity has been previously observed during nodule senescence  <cit> , to our knowledge this is the first time that a specific ap has been isolated and characterized during nodule development.

partial protein sequencing and in silico translation indicated that pvnod <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid single polypeptide containing asp-thr-gly and asp-ser-gly sequences . dtg and dsg are conserved motifs found in all plant aps and are responsible for their catalytic activity. similarity searches of pvnod <dig> indicate that this protein indeed belongs to the a1b peptidase subfamily  and shares significant sequence similarity with a plant atypical ap, cdr <dig>  a protein involved in pathogen defense in arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> .

the biochemical characterization of pvnod <dig> indicates that this enzyme displays unique enzymatic properties, as compared to other aps. although pvnod <dig> is able to bind to a variety of denatured peptidase model substrates , it only partially cleaves casein at mildly acidic ph values . similar to cdr <dig> and also pcs <dig>  another atypical ap involved in cell survival  <cit> , pvnod <dig> is most active at mildly acidic ph and is incompletely inhibited by the archetypical ap inhibitor pepstatin a .

plant atypical aps are distinguished from typical aps by the absence of the plant-specific insert . whereas the psi is not involved in the catalytic activity of plant aps, it is definitively required for vacuolar localization  <cit> . indeed, most typical aps accumulate inside protein storage vacuoles  <cit> . by contrast, characterized plant atypical aps display unexpected localizations; for example, tobacco cnd <dig> is located in chloroplast nucleoids  <cit> , aps from nepenthes are secreted to the pitchers  <cit> , and arabidopsis psc <dig> is retained in the er  <cit> . likewise, pvnod <dig> expression is induced in common bean exclusively during root nodule development  and has a specific subcellular localization .

startlingly, in spite of its sequence similarity to cdr <dig>  pvnod <dig> is not an extracellular ap. instead, this particular ap is located exclusively in uninfected cells of the root nodule central tissue , and its pattern of distribution within the cell  resembles that of arabidopsis pcs <dig>  which is localized to the er  <cit> . arabidopsis pcs <dig> and pvnod <dig> share some other characteristics: both enzymes are able to hydrolyze casein but are inactive against other peptidase model substrates, both are most active at a mildly acidic ph but retain residual activity at a wider range of ph values, and both are only partially inhibited by pepstatin a.

whereas the biological role of pvnod <dig> is still unknown, it is tempting to speculate that this protein might contribute to maintaining the integrity of uninfected root nodule cells via a mechanism analogous to that of cdr <dig>  <cit> . in the central zone of bean root nodules, interconnected rows of uninfected cells are arranged throughout the central region in such a way that they are in direct contact with virtually all infected cells  <cit> . in this scenario, the putative peptide produced by the activity of pvnod <dig> could induce a mild defense response in uninfected cells, which in turn could constrain the spread of the bacteria out of the infected cells of the root nodule. the induction of pvnod <dig> during nodulation in both effective and ineffective nodules  in addition to its absence from uninfected roots supports the hypothesis that pvnod <dig> is involved in defense.

future identification of loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants, as well as the identification of the natural substrate of pvnod <dig>  will be necessary to understand better the functional role of this enzyme during nodulation.

CONCLUSIONS
although a large number of plant ap-like proteins have been identified, so far only a few of them have been isolated and characterized. in this work we isolate and characterize a novel nodulin of phaseolus vulgaris with ap activity. pvnod <dig> is expressed exclusively during the symbiotic process in root nodules and is confined to the uninfected cells of the nodule central zone. here, we have cloned and purified pvnod <dig>  and our results indicate that this enzyme displays some unique properties and others that are shared by arabidopsis cdr <dig> and pcs <dig>  two atypical aps involved in cell defense and survival.
