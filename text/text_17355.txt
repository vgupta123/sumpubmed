BACKGROUND
many biological processes are regulated at the level of transcription. effector genes with specific roles in biological processes are activated and shut down by transcriptional activators and repressors. the strategy of using such transcription factors to amplify a signal to many target genes is conserved in evolution, and many examples for such regulation are known from yeast to human.

in many cases, specific interactions between transcription factors influence the fate of the process as a whole . thus, in order to understand a biological process, it is vital to understand the interplay between the transcription factors that govern the process. very often, transcription networks are very complex, and it becomes difficult to understand the interaction between the transcription factors. to simplify the picture, model organisms with simpler transcription networks are used, of which budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is most useful.

in budding yeast, meiosis has been extensively used as a model for complex developmental processes. the transcriptional control of meiosis in budding yeast is of special interest, since it is composed of several transcriptional waves, controlled by different transcription factors, and has therefore been studied extensively  <cit> 

in yeast, meiosis initiates in diploid cells upon exposure to medium lacking a fermentable carbon source and nitrogen. typically, meiosis is completed in the formation of a rigid ascus that contains four spores , surrounded by a spore wall.

budding yeast meiosis was shown to consist of three distinct phases, each characterized by a different set of transcripts  <cit> ,  <cit> . upon meiosis induction, early phase genes are activated within minutes. the promoter regions of many of these early genes contain a common binding site , which is closely associated with the transcription factor ime <dig>  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> . originally, ime <dig> was thought to work together with ume <dig> in early meiosis; however, recent work has shown that ume <dig> is sent to degradation at this stage and thus cannot participate in early meiotic regulation  <cit> . early phase of meiosis extends to the pachytene checkpoint, when homologous chromosomes are aligned after having recombined with each other.

middle and late genes are transcribed during the meiotic divisions and transcription continues through the formation of the rigid ascus wall  <cit> . analysis of promoters of middle meiotic genes revealed that they share several elements, which might be binding sites for transcription factors  <cit> . later, the transcriptional activator of many middle meiotic genes, ndt <dig>  was discovered, and its binding site was identified  <cit> .

several genome-wide expression studies have been performed on meiotic yeast cultures  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> . these studies have both confirmed and extended classical studies of yeast meiosis. many more genes were grouped into the previously defined temporal categories, confirming the identity and mode of action of meiosis transcriptional regulators.

middle meiosis is tightly regulated. once a cell has passed the pachytene checkpoint and entered middle meiosis it is committed to the meiotic process  <cit> ,  <cit> . moreover, at this stage the temporal variability between cells is reduced to a minimum and all cells that have started meiosis proceed in a synchronized manner  <cit> . it has been suggested that this tight regulation and the transient expression of the middle phase transcripts is achieved through the interplay between the transcriptional activator ndt <dig> and the repressor sum <dig>  <cit> . ndt <dig> was shown to be essential for entry into meiotic divisions, and in its absence cells arrest at the pachytene stage  <cit> . ndt <dig> is induced in early meiosis by the ime <dig> transcriptional activator  <cit>  and its activation is facilitated by phosphorylation by ime <dig>   <cit> ,  <cit> . ndt <dig> binds and activates promoters of genes containing the mse  sequence  <cit> . sum <dig> is a repressor that is associated with the hst <dig> histone deacetylase and represses the transcription of many middle phase genes during vegetative growth  <cit>  and during early meiosis phase  <cit> . sum <dig> protein levels fluctuate during meiosis, decreasing prior to entry into meiosis i and increasing after meiosis ii  <cit> . the expression of several sum <dig> target genes  is deregulated in sum1Δ cells, and their expression levels remain high both in early and late meiosis phases  <cit> ,  <cit> . however, no meiotic phenotype has been observed in this sum1Δ deleted strain. sum <dig> binds a dna binding site which resembles, and partly overlaps, the binding site of ndt <dig>  <cit> ,  <cit> . in vitro experiments have suggested that both transcription factors compete for binding on target promoters  <cit> . taken together, it has been suggested that the tight transcriptional regulation during middle meiosis is achieved through competition between ndt <dig> and sum <dig> 

although this model is possible, it has not been shown to operate in vivo. additionally, it is not known which genes are regulated by both factors, and to what extent sum <dig> is active and necessary in late meiosis.

here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with hybridization to genomic dna microarrays , together with expression profiling, to determine the complete set of targets of ndt <dig> and sum <dig> in middle/late meiosis. these data, together with genetic experiments, challenge the generality of the competition model and suggest that sum1's role in late meiosis may be achieved, in a great part, through its down-regulation of ndt <dig>  our data also help to decipher the transcriptional network during middle/late meiosis. we show that a feed-forward loop governs this network and we analyze the network structure in different transcriptional scenarios. the study may thus be used as a model study for more complex transcriptional networks.

RESULTS
re-establishment of repression of middle phase genes at late meiosis depends on sum1
in yeast meiosis, the middle phase genes are induced upon activation of the ndt <dig> transcriptional activator. many of the ndt <dig> induced genes are consequently repressed at the late meiosis phase  <cit> . this late phase repression was attributed to a competition between ndt <dig> and the transcriptional repressor sum <dig>  which is upregulated at late meiosis  <cit> . according to this view, sum <dig> is essential for the repression of the middle genes. however, deletion of sum <dig> in the sk <dig> background does not cause a significant increase in the levels of ndt <dig> and other middle meiosis genes at late stages of meiosis  <cit> , suggesting that other factors beside sum <dig> may be involved in the repression of middle genes in sk <dig> background. on the other hand, in w <dig> background, sum <dig> seems to play an important role in late meiosis repression. deleting sum <dig> in w <dig>  causes accumulation of ndt <dig> protein  in late meiosis phase in a sharp contrast to the transient middle meiosis expression pattern characterizing ndt <dig> in wt w <dig> cells . this aberrantly expressed ndt <dig> maintains its dna binding activity and in the sum1Δ strain its binding to its own promoter  can be detected even at  <dig> hours after switching to sporulation medium .

subtle defects in meiosis in the absence of sum1
the important role of sum <dig> in late meiosis in the w <dig> background is further emphasized through an analysis of the phenotypes of the sum1Δ strain. in contrast to the sk <dig> background in which no phenotype was detected in the sum1Δ strain  <cit> , in w <dig> background we observed meiotic defects. analysis of the sensitivity of spores to heat and to zymolyase digestion, revealed clear differences between wt and sum1Δ spores. we found that the germination of spores resulting from the sum1Δ meiosis  is heat sensitive . we also found that after  <dig> hours in zymolyase, an enzyme with lytic activity against yeast cell walls , the sum1Δ spores did not germinate at all, whereas wild-type spores germinated efficiently . these findings suggest that the spore wall of spores arising from sum1Δ meiosis might be defective.

yeast cells undergoing meiosis react to restricted energy  by producing fewer spores per ascus, 1- <dig> instead of  <dig>  <cit> . when we monitored the energy management in sum1Δ meiosis by counting the number of spores per ascus at different concentrations of acetate in the sporulation medium , we found that sum1Δ sporulation did not respond to acetate restriction as well as the wild-type strain did. sum1Δ cells undergoing sporulation produced a lower frequency of asci with 1- <dig> spores than wild-type cells . this result hints to a further defect in spore wall synthesis control, or to a more general energetic defect in these cells, that fail to react to environmental cues in the prescribed optimal manner.

we conclude that in w <dig> strains, sum <dig> is an important repressor, which is responsible for the re-establishment of repression of middle phase genes towards the late phase of meiosis. in the absence of sum <dig>  defects occur in spore formation, which lead to defects in spore germination.

analysis of expression profiling
to gain better insight into middle and late phase meiotic gene expression in yeast of w <dig> genetic background and its relation to ndt <dig> and sum <dig> activity, we performed an expression profile experiment extended to include the late meiosis phase . the expression profile experiment was designed to pay special attention to the asynchronous nature of meiotic cultures . to do so, we used an algorithm for the de-convolution of gene expression data  <cit> ,  <cit>  by using dapi staining information for estimation of the stage of meiosis achieved at every time point . the raw expression data was therefore corrected to reflect the gene expression of a synchronous population of cells. the results of the expression analysis are detailed in additional file  <dig>  clustering  of the expression data reveals ten clusters of genes with different temporal expression patterns . two of the clusters  show a distinct induction during middle meiosis, and were enriched for sporulation and spore wall synthesis go categories. these two clusters together contain  <dig> genes, of which 78%  were identified as middle meiosis genes by at least one of the previous methods , and the existence of ndt <dig> binding sites  <cit> ). among the  <dig> middle meiosis genes that were not identified before by genomic methods, we found genes encoding important meiotic cell cycle regulators such as clb <dig>  and hos <dig> , and other cell cycle regulators such as apc <dig> and cdc <dig>  our analysis reveals for the first time a cluster of  <dig> genes  that shows distinct repression during middle meiosis. this cluster is highly enriched for genes involved in metabolism, suggesting a possible role for repression of respiration and metabolism towards the advanced stages of yeast meiosis.

binding profiles of ndt <dig> and sum <dig> during meiosis middle and late phase
to understand the control of middle meiotic genes by ndt <dig> and sum <dig>  we performed chip-chip experiments with these factors in meiosis. according to our western-blot analysis , and previous studies  <cit> , ndt <dig> is expressed exclusively at middle meiotic time points. to understand which genes it regulates, chip-chip was performed on samples collected  <dig> hours after transfer to sporulation medium . using a stringent threshold  =  <dig> ; see methods) we found  <dig> ndt <dig> target genes . three lines of evidence suggest that these genes are indeed ndt <dig> targets -first, the list of ndt <dig> targets is highly enriched for several main meiotic go categories - spore wall assembly  and sporulation , and is also enriched for the cell division go category , a mitotic related category, intimately associated with meiotic divisions as well. second, using de novo motif search algorithms , we found that the promoters of these genes are highly enriched for the presence of the middle sporulation element  , the known binding site of ndt <dig>  <cit> ,  <cit> . finally, we detected binding of ndt <dig> to about half of its previously suggested targets .

moreover, analysis of published meiotic expression profiles revealed that our chip-on-chip data captured roughly a fifth  of the genes that belong to previously identified middle phase clusters , and almost half  of the genes in one of these clusters , strongly supporting the role of ndt <dig> binding in middle meiotic gene expression. in our meiotic expression profile, ndt <dig> was found to bind the promoters of 45/ <dig>  genes belonging to the middle meiotic clusters  <dig> and  <dig> 

to find out which promoters sum <dig> binds in the late phase, we performed a chip-chip experiment on sum <dig> at  <dig> hours after transfer to sporulation medium. using a threshold similar to the one used for ndt <dig> , we detected  <dig> sum <dig> targets . the list of targets is similar but not identical to chip-chip on sum <dig> in mitotic cells previously performed  <cit> . most, but not all mitotic targets were found to be bound in meiosis , and many specific late meiotic targets have been found . this list of genes is significantly enriched for the main meiotic go categories - spore wall assembly , and sporulation  and for the cell division category , the same categories enriched for in the ndt <dig> binding data. motif analysis found enrichment for the mse* motif  which is the known binding site of sum <dig>  <cit> ,  <cit> . here also our experimental data found direct evidence for the interaction of sum <dig> with the promoter regions of most of its putative target genes .

further analysis revealed three groups of target genes : i) ndt80-only targets, ii) common targets of both regulators, and iii) sum1-only targets . these assignments were confirmed by performing chip-pcr on several representative genes . binding site analysis further confirmed the categorization. scanning the target promoters, using a threshold that recognizes binding sites in 5% of the promoters  revealed a  <dig>  fold enrichment for the mse motif  in the ndt80-only targets and a  <dig>  fold enrichment for the mse* motif  in the sum1-only targets. on the other hand only the common targets were enriched for both motifs . further support for the distinction between these groups came from the sum <dig> binding data in mitotic cells  <cit> . while 25%  of the common targets were also identified by harbison et al  <cit>  as sum <dig> targets , only  <dig> %  of the ndt80-only targets group were identified as sum <dig> targets. furthermore, pierce et al  <cit>  have identified the genes that are derepressed  in rich medium upon sum <dig> deletion. in the common targets group  <dig> %  were derepressed compared to only  <dig> %  in the ndt80-only group. it should be noted that a similar percentage of the genes in both groups was affected  upon over-expression of ndt <dig> in rich medium  of the ndt80-only targets  <cit> ).

to further characterize the three groups we performed go annotation analysis. this analysis revealed that only the common targets group is significantly enriched for the major meiotic categories - sporulation  and spore wall assembly , and for the cell division category , whereas the other groups are populated by genes involved in multiple functions related to meiosis such as rna metabolism and transport but are not significantly enriched for any specific go category . it thus seems that ndt <dig> and sum <dig> bind to a common set of targets, which is functionally important for middle meiosis, and has a middle meiotic expression pattern. in addition, these two factors each bind to a unique set of targets as well.

in spite of the apparent differences in the regulation of the common targets and the ndt80-only groups, they show a surprisingly similar middle-meiotic expression pattern, being induced in middle phase, and re-establishing repression at the late phase .

in order to decipher the source of late meiosis repression of the ndt <dig> only target genes, we performed a genomic expression profile on sum1Δ cells in early, middle and late meiosis . this profile clearly shows , that the rna of both the common and the ndt80-only targets accumulates without repression in sum1Δ cells, suggesting an involvement of sum <dig> also in the down regulation of ndt80-only targets. this explanation of the results is preferable over the assumption that most of the cells in the sum1Δ strain are stuck in a middle meiosis stage, since this strain can complete sporulation and form normal looking asci. moreover, analysis of the expression profile data revealed that most late meiotic genes, which are not targets of ndt <dig> or sum <dig>  are expressed also in the sum1Δ strain  and are not bound by ndt <dig> or sum <dig>  64% of them are expressed in late meiosis also in the sum1Δ strain). it is noteworthy that the level of expression of all targets is relatively low in the sum1Δ strain compared to wild type. this might hint to a positive role mediated indirectly by sum <dig> on the expression of meiotic genes, possibly through interaction with the meiotic early phase transcription regulators.

control of the ndt <dig> promoter by sum1
how is the repression of ndt80-only targets in the late phase established without binding of sum1? one of the possibilities is that the binding of sum <dig> to the ndt <dig> promoter  <cit>  is responsible for the repression of ndt <dig> in late meiosis, allowing for the repression of the ndt80-only targets in an indirect manner. we wanted to check if sum <dig> binds the ndt <dig> promoter in meiosis late phase. to this end we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and determined ndt <dig> and sum <dig> binding to the ndt <dig> promoter in two time points by pcr. we found a shift in the transcription factor binding along meiosis. while ndt <dig> occupation decreases between  <dig> and  <dig> hours in sporulation medium, sum <dig> increases its occupancy on the ndt <dig> promoter . these results suggest that the regulation of the ndt <dig> gene is accomplished through the binding of ndt <dig> to its promoter during middle phase, which is later replaced by sum <dig>  thus ensuring the down-regulation of ndt <dig> in late meiosis.

ndt80-only targets are repressed indirectly while common targets are also affected by sum <dig> direct binding
our finding of sum1-dependent down regulation of ndt80-only targets suggests that sum <dig> affects the transcription of those genes indirectly through its regulation of the ndt <dig> promoter  <cit> . on the other hand, regulation of the common target genes can occur both directly, through the binding of sum <dig>  and indirectly, through its regulation of ndt <dig>  to check which of the modes of control is the predominant one, we interfered with the binding of sum <dig> to the ndt <dig> promoter. to this end we used a yeast strain in which the ndt <dig> promoter was replaced by an inducible promoter  that can be turned on by administration of estradiol to the medium . in this strain, ndt <dig> transcripts accumulate in late meiosis since sum <dig> no longer represses it . comparison of the repression of different target genes in late meiosis stages in wild-type  and in the mk-er-ndt <dig> strains should allow us to separate between the effects of sum <dig> on gene expression through its regulation of ndt <dig> and other effects of sum <dig>  this strain enters meiosis after the addition of estradiol in a similar efficiency as a wt w <dig> strain  but rarely  completes sporulation. nevertheless, expression profiling of this strain at three time points following the induction of ndt <dig> by estradiol , revealed that these cells do enter the late meiotic stages since most  of the ndt <dig> and sum <dig> independent late meiosis genes , are expressed also in this strain.

to assess the effect of sum <dig> on the repression of ndt <dig> target genes, we analyzed the changes in the expression pattern of  <dig> ndt <dig> targets that show late phase repression . for each of those genes we calculated the fold change between the middle and the late time points in the wt, mk-er-ndt <dig> and sum1Δ strains . as expected, the repression of ndt80-only target genes was compromised in the mk-er-ndt <dig> strain , suggesting that ndt <dig> down regulation by sum <dig> plays a significant role in the regulation of those genes. on the other hand, the average repression of the common genes was the same in both strains , suggesting that in those genes the repression is probably not gained through the down regulation of ndt <dig> but through the direct interaction of sum <dig> with their promoter. both groups  were similarly affected in the sum1Δ strain .

taken together, our results decipher two regulatory mechanisms for middle meiotic gene repression at late meiosis. the repression is achieved either directly, through sum <dig> binding to the promoters of the target genes, or indirectly, through sum <dig> regulation of the expression of the ndt <dig> gene. both regulatory mechanisms can act together in the repression of the common genes, forming a feed forward loop regulatory motif . our detailed genetic analysis allows us to assess the relative contribution of the direct and indirect effects of sum <dig> for each of the common genes. by comparing the repression levels in both strains we have calculated a metric , which captures the relative contribution of ndt <dig> regulation to the repression pattern of each gene . we found that approximately 50% of the genes were repressed to the same extent in both strains, suggesting that most of the repression of those genes is achieved independently of ndt <dig>  the remaining genes were repressed to different levels in the two strains suggesting a different weight for the direct and indirect repressing mechanisms for each gene.

discussion
many biological processes are regulated at the transcriptional level. this mode of regulation gives an evolutionary advantage, as a change in a small number of transcription activators and repressors, investing relatively little energy, can be amplified to affect large-scale biological events. transcription regulation is frequently achieved through the interplay between activators and repressors.

meiosis is an example to such a cellular differentiation process. common to most eukaryotes, meiosis forms haploid gametes from diploid non-differentiated cells. in budding yeast, meiosis has been studied in detail, and several transcriptional regulators of the process have been identified  <cit> . whole-genome expression during meiosis was performed by several groups , confirming previous classical studies of gene transcription during meiosis  <cit> , and revealing an interesting repertoire of regulation patterns of hundreds of genes that are either induced or repressed during meiosis. of the genes induced during the middle phase of meiosis many show a distinct middle meiosis expression pattern in which transcription is induced and then repressed few hours later . the transient regulation of these genes has been suggested to occur through competition between an activator  and a repressor . indeed, bioinformatic analysis revealed that the promoters of many of the middle meiosis genes contain binding sites of both transcription factors  <cit> . the implication of this regulatory model is that the promoters of the middle genes are occupied first by the activator in middle meiosis and then are replaced by the repressor, which shuts down transcription in the late phase. we were able to confirm in vivo for the first time, that this is indeed what happens on the promoter of ndt <dig> itself, on which ndt <dig> is bound at middle meiosis  and is replaced by sum <dig> at later stages  . furthermore, we have found by chip-on-chip  a large set of genes commonly bound by ndt <dig> and by sum <dig>  although we cannot rule out the possibility that both factors are bound simultaneously to these promoters, analysis of ndt <dig> and sum <dig> protein levels  suggests that at  <dig> hours mainly ndt <dig> binds whereas at  <dig> hours mainly sum <dig> is bound to the promoters.

the competition model suggests that sum <dig> binding to the promoters is needed for the down regulation of the target genes. surprisingly, we have observed a similar repression at late meiosis of genes bound only by ndt <dig> . analysis of gene expression of a yeast strain deleted for sum <dig> revealed that sum <dig> is crucial for the down regulation of all kinds of target genes, including ndt <dig> target genes that are not bound by sum <dig> . this down regulation is probably linked to the fact that ndt <dig> itself is down regulated by sum <dig> and thus at late meiotic stages its levels decrease in a sum <dig> dependent manner . indeed, releasing ndt <dig> from the control of sum <dig> by using a yeast strain containing an inducible ndt <dig>  results in losing most of the late meiosis repression in some of the ndt <dig> targets . we were able to show that while in the ndt80-only targets, most of the repression pattern, although sum <dig> dependent, is a result of an indirect effect of sum <dig>  in the common targets both pathways- some genes are repressed mainly directly by sum <dig>  whereas in other genes the indirect repression by sum <dig> is also important. using the mk-er-ndt <dig> strain, we were able to quantify the effects of sum1's binding to ndt <dig> on the repression pattern in late meiosis phase. we conclude that the interplay between an activator and a repressor in a given process may be complex and may depend on the specific context of the targets bound by both factors. individual targets may vary therefore in the degree affected by each factor. genetic manipulation may help to quantify this effect.

promoters of genes from the common targets group are bound by both ndt <dig> and its repressor sum <dig>  this type of regulatory pattern is abundant in yeast , and was termed a "feed-forward loop"  <cit> ,  <cit>  or more specifically a "coherent feed-forward loop" type  <dig>  <cit> . this type of interaction was suggested to be suitable for cases in which a biological process is driven in a single direction, a definition that suits middle meiosis stages in which the yeast cells are already committed to meiosis. studying feed forward loops as a group of network motifs  assumes that the contribution of the direct and indirect effects of the upstream factor are equal and similar for all genes. however, our results with the mk-er-ndt <dig> strain reveal that this assumption may not always be true. we find that different genes are repressed to different extents in the mutant strain, suggesting that the relative contribution of the direct and the indirect effects of the upstream factor may be different for different target genes. moreover, our finding that in some genes most of the repression is carried out through the down-regulation of ndt <dig>  and that the contribution of the direct binding of sum <dig> to the target genes is relatively small, demonstrates the importance of measuring the actual contribution of different edges in order to precisely analyze network motifs. in order to quantify the differences between the two regulatory modes of sum <dig> , we calculated a metric capturing the relative contribution of the regulation of the target genes through ndt <dig>  we suggest that introducing such metrics into other transcriptional regulatory networks might prove to be very important for understanding the true nature of the genetic interaction.

the sum <dig> dependent down regulation of genes in late meiosis seems to be important for spore endurance, since the spores of a sum1Δ deletion strain are more susceptible to heat shock, zymolase treatment and sporulation in a limiting carbon source medium . in contrast to our results in w <dig> genetic background, previous analysis of sum1Δ sporulation in sk <dig> background did not reveal any severe meiotic phenotype  <cit> . in spite of the lack of an obvious meiotic phenotype upon sum <dig> deletion, a severe meiotic phenotype was observed when the sum <dig> deletion was combined with deletion of components of the pachytene checkpoint  <cit> . this observation supports our assumption that additional players are involved in late phase repression in sk <dig>  different qtls contributing to the different sporulation efficiency of sk <dig> and s288c  have already been found in a previous study from our lab  <cit> . further experiments are needed to determine if there is a connection between these qtls and the involvement of different repressors in late phase transcriptional repression.

CONCLUSIONS
by a combination of genetics and genomics experiments, we show an active interplay between two transcription factors on a subset of common targets during the middle and late phases of yeast meiosis. this interplay is responsible for the expression patterns of many genes during those stages, and thus is responsible for the biological outcome of these meiotic stages. we show that the absence of one of the factors from the meiotic cells has deleterious phenotypic consequences, and changes the expression patterns of these transcription factors' targets. we show that in middle-late meiosis the expression pattern is regulated primarily through the regulation of the ndt <dig> transcript levels. this reminds one of the regulation of the early phase in meiosis of s. cerevisiae, much of which is regulated by the ime <dig> transcript levels  <cit> . having two master regulators for the two major parts of meiosis is of great regulatory importance, as the first master regulator is in charge of the uncommitted phase of meiosis, and the second for the committed phase of meiosis  <cit> . a separation between two regulatory phases in meiosis, one before the meiotic divisions and the second one starting at the meiotic divisions might be conserved in evolution. for example mei <dig>  a transcriptional regulator from schizosaccharomyces pombe, regulates the second phase in meiosis that starts at the meiotic divisions  <cit> ,  <cit> , similar to ndt <dig>
