BACKGROUND
membrane-membrane interactions play key roles in animal physiology and development, and one protein family that has been implicated in these interactions is the ferlins. in mammals, there are four ferlin genes: dysferlin , myoferlin , otoferlin , and ferlin-1-like  <dig>   <cit> . in caenorhabditis elegans, there are two: fertilization defective- <dig>  and fertilization defective like- <dig>   <cit> . d. melanogaster has one ferlin gene, misfire   <cit> . thus far, ferlins have been characterized by multiple c <dig> domains  and a transmembrane  domain near the c-terminus  <cit> . c <dig> domains are independently folded units of ~ <dig> amino acids that form parallel β-sheets connected by surface loops. they are present in many proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking, such as protein kinase c, phospholipase, and synaptotagmin, and have the capacity to bind substrates that include ca2+, phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and phosphotyrosines  <cit> .

the specific roles and binding partners of the ferlin c <dig> domains, which are denoted c2a-c2f, are largely unknown. at least a subset are proposed to bind ca2+ since the activities of mammalian and c. elegans ferlins are ca2+-mediated  <cit> . a study using an in vitro assay to measure changes in fluorescence emission spectrum after ca2+ binding, suggested that the c2d domain of mouse otof has ca2+ binding capacity  <cit> . in addition, in vitro assays have been used to document differences among the c <dig> domains in human dysf and myof. of the six c <dig> domains in these proteins, only c2a, which resides closest to the n-terminus, was found to bind phospholipid vesicles in a ca2+ dependent manner  <cit> .

the functional roles of ferlins are revealed by the detrimental effects of gene disruptions. an important example occurs in the skeletal muscles of mice and humans with mutations in the dysf gene  <cit> . current data suggest that dysf, which is localized to intracellular vesicles, acts to repair skeletal muscle membrane tears by permitting vesicle fusion and creating a plasma membrane patch  <cit> . in humans lacking normal dysf, muscle membrane tears are inefficiently repaired, and, consequently, two forms of muscular dystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2b and miyoshi myopathy, can develop  <cit> .

other members of the ferlin protein family have also been implicated in membrane-membrane interactions. mutations in mammalian otof cause a form of autosomal recessive deafness known as dfnb <dig> due to problems with synaptic vesicle exocytosis in inner ear hair cells  <cit> . although myof has not yet been associated with a disease phenotype, it is localized to closely apposed membranes in a cell-culture model of muscle differentiation and myoblasts from myof null mice do not fuse efficiently  <cit> . mutations in c. elegans fer- <dig> affect the fusion of golgi-derived membranous organelles with spermatid plasma membrane  <cit> . as a result, the spermatids fail to mature into motile sperm, causing male sterility. the functions of mammalian fer1l <dig> and c. elegans ferl- <dig> are not yet known  <cit> .

ohsako et al.  <cit>  previously reported that the d. melanogaster mfr gene is specifically required for male fertility and fertilization. this conclusion was based on a phenotypic analysis of only a single mutant allele. here we characterized the mfr gene and showed that it has a complex transcriptional profile, with testis- and ovary-specific promoters and alternatively spliced transcripts that predict multiple isoforms. through studies of  <dig> mfr mutations, we confirmed a role for mfr in sperm function and discovered roles in egg patterning and early embryogenesis. together, the molecular and genetic studies permitted a correlation of ferlin structure with function and provided evidence that mfr carries out its multiple developmental roles using different protein isoforms.

RESULTS
mutations in the mfr gene have been recovered in two independent screens for male sterile mutations  <cit> . here, we describe  <dig> alleles that were recovered from the screen of wakimoto et al.,  <cit>  as strong male sterile mutations. we classified these mutations as arresting sperm activation based on similarity to the phenotype induced by mutations in the snky gene  <cit> . genetic mapping and complementation tests with mfr <dig>  <cit>  confirmed these mutant alleles are new mfr alleles. to understand effects on ferlin function, we molecularly characterized the mfr gene and the mutant alleles.

the mfr gene exhibits complex transcriptional regulation
as reported by yamamoto and ohsako  <cit> , mfr corresponds to cg <dig>  whose structure was predicted by the drosophila genome project  <cit> . the lack of mfr ests recovered from various cdna screens  <cit>  and failure to detect mfr transcripts on northern blots containing poly a+ rna from  <dig>  testes,  <dig> ovaries, and male and female carcasses , indicates that mfr transcripts may be rare. consequently, we used rt-pcr to search for mfr transcripts and detected transcripts in the testes and ovaries, but not in the carcasses of adult flies that lacked gonads .

to determine the mfr transcript structure, we performed 5' and 3' race using poly a+ rna isolated from testes and ovaries. sequence analysis of  <dig> testicular and  <dig> ovarian 5' race products revealed multiple transcriptional start sites . all six of the identified testis transcription start sites mapped within a  <dig> bp region. this pattern of multiple nearby start sites is characteristic of a slippery promoter, which has previously been described by yasuhara et al.,  <cit>  for other drosophila genes. in contrast, the three identified ovarian transcription start sites mapped over a wider span of  <dig> bp, with each site distinct from those identified in the testis.

the mfr promoters lack the motifs identified by ohler et al.  <cit>  as common to drosophila promoters. however, we note two regions of interest as putative regulatory sequences that are highly conserved among drosophila species . a  <dig> bp sequence, located just downstream of the 5' most testes transcription start site is also found in the homologous mfr region in d. simulans, d. yakuba, d. ananassae, and shows 86% identity in d. pseudoobscura. a  <dig> bp sequence which is located  <dig> bp upstream of the most 5' ovarian start site shows complete conservation in d. simulans, d. yakuba, d. ananassae, d. pseudoobscura, and 76% identity in the more distantly related d. mojavensis, and d. virilis. the location of this sequence is also within the 5' utr of tsp66e, which is transcribed from the opposite strand of mfr orthologs in all of these species. therefore, it may be an important regulatory sequence for either gene.

sequence of  <dig> testicular and  <dig> ovarian 3' race products indicated that mfr has a single site for polyadenylation, which is located  <dig> nt downstream of a predicted stop codon. together, the 5' and 3' race studies defined a minimal gene size of  <dig>  kb, extending from the most upstream ovarian start site to the polyadenylation site. an estimate of maximum gene size was provided by testing a transgene containing a  <dig>  kb genomic fragment for its ability to rescue mfr mutant phenotypes. two independent insertions of the transgene fully rescued the mfr male sterility in a single copy  and also rescued a defect in egg patterning, which is described in more detail below, in two copies . compared to the  <dig>  kb region, this transgene includes an additional  <dig> bp of upstream sequence and ~ <dig>  kb downstream of the polyadenylation site.

differential splicing of mfr transcripts predicts tissue-specific protein isoforms
we used the race results to design primer sets to recover near full-length mfr cdnas from polya+ selected testis and ovary rna. analysis of six testicular and nine ovarian cdnas revised the cg <dig> predicted gene structure  <cit>  and identified differently spliced mrnas with the potential to yield seven different mfr protein isoforms .

the longest cdna , which was recovered from testis rna, contains  <dig> exons and an open reading frame  with three in-frame met codons located in exon  <dig> . atg# <dig> may be the initiating methionine codon for the mrna corresponding to cdna t <dig> because the sequences between atg# <dig> and atg# <dig> in d. melanogaster and its sister species are largely conserved , suggesting a selective pressure to maintain the region as coding. the longest orf predicts a protein with  <dig>  amino acids, a tm domain near the c-terminus, and five c <dig> domains . the c <dig> domains are denoted c2b-c2f based on their homology to c <dig> domains in mammalian ferlin proteins  <cit> . three additional testis cdnas  reflect alternative splicing events that increase the length of the 5' utr and shorten the length of the orf . corresponding protein isoforms are predicted to have two or three c <dig> domains, with the shortest isoform  lacking the tm domain .

analysis of nine ovarian cdnas revealed three different splicing variants, and all were different from those seen in testis cdnas . the ovarian transcripts vary in coding capacity and the length of the 5' utr. corresponding protein isoforms are predicted to have between one and three c <dig> domains, and only isoform o <dig> is predicted to have a tm domain .

mfr mutations indicate that male fertility requires the longest predicted mfr isoform
for each of the  <dig> mfr mutations, we assayed the fertility of males that were homozygous or hemizygous in combination with deficiencies dfh-i <dig> or dfed <dig>  we also tested the fertility of males with several mfr heteroallelic combinations . the result in all cases was strong recessive male sterility, with no progeny produced from any of the crosses between mfr males and wild-type females.

to understand how mfr mutation might affect ferlin function, we identified the molecular lesions in each of the  <dig> mutations. the mutations are distributed throughout the gene and provide information about the functional significance of predicted isoforms and specific residues . in particular, they implicate isoform t <dig> as essential for male fertility as it is the only isoform expected to be disrupted by all of the mutations. the missense mutation mfrz <dig>  which changes a methionine to an isoleucine, provides additional evidence that atg# <dig>  encodes the initiating methionine. also, mfrz <dig>  which, like mfrz <dig>  is expected to affect only isoform t <dig>  changes a valine that is conserved in d. simulans, d. sechellia, d. yakuba, and d. erecta to aspartic acid in the region of the protein that is predicted to form the c2c domain. because valine is a hydrophobic nonpolar amino acid and aspartic acid is a negatively charged amino acid, the mfrz <dig> mutation likely disrupts c2c structure. in addition, mfrz <dig> replaces a glycine, which is located between c2e and c2f, to a serine. this glycine is conserved in all known and predicted ferlin proteins in other species, indicating a key functional role in ferlins.

mapping of the mutations also revealed a disproportionately high number of nonsense mutations. eight mutations are predicted to truncate isoform t <dig>  either by mutating a splice junction  or in seven cases, by changing an amino acid to a stop codon . three of the nonsense mutations, mfrz <dig>  mfrz <dig>  and mfrz <dig> are the best candidates for mfr null mutations since they map to the c2e-c2f region that is shared by all of the predicted testis isoforms.

mfr mutations consistently affect sperm function during fertilization
to characterize the cause of mfr male sterility, we introduced a transgene that expresses the don-juan gfp  sperm tail marker into five different mfr mutant backgrounds, then monitored efficiency of sperm entry into the egg. studies with a control strain show that the dj-gfp assay detects 87% of the sperm entry events in eggs for up to  <dig> min after egg deposition . during normal fertilization, sperm entry is followed by events of sperm activation, including sperm plasma membrane breakdown , nuclear decondensation, and formation of male pronucleus, in rapid succession. we found that in 85–100% eggs laid by wild type females mated to mfr males, sperm entered the egg . however, nearly all retained a highly condensed nucleus . three mfr alleles, including two nonsense alleles, occasionally allowed sperm to undergo nuclear decondensation and reach the pronuclear apposition stage, but not beyond .

previous studies indicated that the mfr <dig> allele  <cit> , like snky mutations  <cit> , affects pmbd. to monitor pmbd in eggs fertilized by sperm produced by mfrz <dig> males, we used the method of wilson et al.  <cit> . specifically, the membrane protein cd <dig> was introduced into the sperm plasma membrane through expression of a cd <dig> transgene during spermatogenesis and its presence was monitored by immunolocalization before and after sperm entry into the egg. we found that the cd <dig> epitope was retained around the head and tail of mfrz <dig> mutant sperm for at least  <dig> min after egg deposition in 83% of the eggs we monitored , supporting an effect of mfr on pmbd.

because snky is also important for sperm pmbd  <cit> , mfr could affect this event by controlling the localization of snky. to test this idea, we introduced snky-gfp into sperm produced by mfrz <dig> males and assayed gfp expression. as shown in figure  <dig>  this mfr nonsense mutation does not alter the localization of snky-gfp to the acrosomal membrane  <cit> .

a subset of mfr mutations affects egg patterning
expression of mfr transcripts in ovaries suggested a possible function during oogenesis. this role was confirmed by the discovery a recessive egg patterning phenotype induced by a subset of mfr mutations when expressed in females. the defect is visible in late stage eggs as abnormally short and closely apposed dorsal appendages , a feature of the eggshell that signifies a ventralized egg chamber  <cit> .

penetrance of the egg patterning defect varied among the alleles , with females hemizygous for the mfrz <dig>  mfrz <dig>  or mfrz <dig> allele producing 14–22% abnormal eggs. the fact that these three nonsense alleles induced defects, but four nonsense mutations located upstream of the c2d encoding region do not , suggests that normal egg patterning requires a short mfr isoform. interestingly, two additional mutations that map downstream of c2d do not induce egg patterning defects. these mutations are mfrz <dig>  which changes a glycine to a serine, and mfrz <dig>  which mutates a splice junction to create a premature stop codon in some transcripts. based on the locations of the nonsense mutations, the ovarian transcript that is important for egg patterning likely encodes the c2e and c2f domains, but does not use the splice junction affected by the mfrz <dig> mutation. this structure is not represented among the three identified ovarian cdnas.

we note that penetrance of the mutant phenotype in eggs produced by hemizygous females does not exceed 22% in any case, indicating that mfr likely has a redundant function in ovaries. surprisingly, we found that the percentage of egg patterning defects significantly increases to as high as 41% when the mfrz <dig>  mfrz <dig>  and mfrz <dig> are placed in heteroallelic combinations . this observation verifies that mfr proteins are expressed during oogenesis and suggests that the truncated mfr proteins induce a dose-sensitive disruptive effect on egg patterning.

this χ <dig> analysis shows that the percentage of egg patterning defects is significantly different when the eggs produced by mfrz <dig>  mfrz <dig>  and mfrz <dig> over df ed4415) females are compared to females with these three alleles in heteroallelic combination.

next, we investigated whether the defect might be accounted for by disruption of gurken, a key ligand in the egg patterning pathway. in normal stage  <dig> egg chambers, gurken shows a characteristic distribution in the anterior dorsal corner of the oocyte. this distribution permits proper signaling to overlying follicle cells  <cit> . follicle cells that receive the gurken ligand activate a downstream pathway that is responsible for the formation and proper spacing of the dorsal appendages  <cit> . immunolocalization of gurken revealed that in the majority of stage  <dig> egg chambers produced by control bw;st or mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> females, gurken is properly localized . however, in 15% of the bw;st egg chambers  and 43% of the mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> egg chambers , gurken does not extend as far posteriorly . a χ <dig> likelihood ratio test reveals that this difference is statistically significant .

mfr mutations affect female fertility and the progression of embryogenesis
mutations in mfr also affect embryonic development. notably, only 43% of the total eggs laid by mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> mutant females mated to wild-type males hatch . this hatch rate is similar for eggs with wild-type eggshell morphology and those with defective dorsal appendages; therefore, mfr's role in embryogenesis may be separate from its role in egg patterning. furthermore, the hatch rate of embryos of mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> mothers is significantly lower than the 84% hatch rate of embryos produced by the mfrz <dig> or mfrz1386/tm <dig> control strain  and the 52% hatch rate observed for the bw;st parent strain .

to determine if the lower hatch rates are caused by visible defects during early embryonic development, mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> and control  females were mated to wild-type males and a minimum of  <dig> eggs were collected from each mating at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes after egg deposition. the embryos were fixed and stained with dapi to visualize nuclei, and then classified according to mitotic cycle . this analysis revealed that the development of embryos produced from mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> mothers is delayed compared to embryos produced from mothers of the two control strains . furthermore, an ordinal logistic regression analysis confirms that the effect of maternal strain on the stage of the embryonic development is statistically significant . this effect remains statistically significant when pairwise comparisons between the three strains are made.

compared to mfrz <dig> or mfrz1386/tm <dig>  embryos produced by bw;st females have low hatch rates. however, if the embryos arrested before a the end of cycle  <dig> are removed from the data set and a subsequent ordinal logistic analysis is performed, the effect of strain on mitotic stage is no longer significant between the bw;st parent strain and the mfrz <dig> or mfrz1386/tm <dig> control strain . this results suggests that embryos from bw;st mothers show defects in completing cycle  <dig>  but if the embryos complete cycle  <dig>  then the distribution of mitotic stages is similar to embryos from the mfrz <dig> or mfrz1386/tm <dig> mothers through cycle  <dig>  conversely, after the cycle  <dig> data is removed, maternal strain retains a significant effect on mitotic stage when embryos from mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> mothers are compared to embryos from both bw;st  and mfrz <dig> or mfrz1386/tm <dig>  mothers. this result indicates that mitotic defects in embryos from mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> mothers are not limited to the completion of cycle  <dig>  but instead extend into later cycles.

discussion
we found that the d. melanogaster ferlin gene misfire is expressed in the testis and ovaries of adult flies, and has tissue-specific transcription initiation sites, alternatively spliced mrnas, and multiple developmental functions. our analysis of cdnas, while not exhaustive, has provided a framework for predicting potential mfr isoforms and for interpreting the differential effects of mutations on male and female fertility.

thus far, ferlins have been described as having multiple c <dig> domains, typically four to six, and a tm domain at the c-terminus. our cdna study confirmed this ferlin structure for the predicted protein isoform t <dig>  which we suggest from genetic data is the mfr protein required for male fertility. however, we also isolated cdnas that predict shorter testis and ovary isoforms. alternative splicing appears to be common in the ferlin gene family  <cit> . for human otof, northern blot analysis shows that both short and long transcripts are produced  <cit> . the functional significance of the short transcript is unknown, but its structure is strikingly similar to that predicted for mfr isoforms t <dig> and t <dig>  also, a subset of mfr cdnas  predicts isoforms that contain one to three c <dig> domains, but lack the tm domain. cdnas that predict ferlin isoforms lacking tm domains have also been reported for human myof and c. elegans fer- <dig>  <cit> . further biochemical studies are needed to determine which ferlin isoforms are produced and whether variation in c <dig> domains or presence of soluble versus membrane forms contributes to function.

ferlin proteins are known to have a role in ca2+-dependent membrane-membrane interactions in mammalian muscle cells, myoblasts, and inner ear hair cells  <cit> , and c. elegans spermatids  <cit> . therefore, mfr may also mediate ca2+-dependent interactions between membranes. in males, mfr's time of action may be during spermatogenesis to affect sperm function during fertilization. however, its multiple effects on pmbd and later stages of sperm activation suggest activity of the protein during fertilization. after insemination, mfr could facilitate interactions between the acrosome and sperm plasma membrane to elicit pmbd. these interactions may also involve snky, an acrosomal membrane protein that like mfr, we propose is acting as a signaling protein for pmbd  <cit> . previously it was proposed that pmbd might occasionally occur spontaneously, allowing sperm produced by snky mutant males to effectively bypass the requirement for snky and produce a few progeny  <cit> . here, we show that a subset of sperm lacking mfr function progress past pmbd to achieve nuclear decondensation and pronuclear apposition, but produce no progeny. later events of sperm function, perhaps those associated with nuclear envelope dynamics or pronuclear apposition, may also require one or more mfr isoforms. possible ca2+ cues for mfr activation may come from an intracellular source such as the acrosome, which is a ca2+-storage vesicle in sperm of some species  <cit> , or from cytoplasmic sources in the activated d. melanogaster egg  <cit> .

only three of the male sterile mutations, which are all located downstream of the c2d encoding region, induce detectable effects on female fertility. the locations of these mutations are consistent with the idea that a short ovarian isoform, which includes the c2e and c2f domains, is important for gurken localization and consequently egg patterning. however, the incomplete penetrance of the mfr phenotype even with presumed null alleles mfrz <dig>  mfrz <dig>  and mfrz <dig> suggests that other proteins can at least partially compensate for loss of mfr. in addition, embryos produced by mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> mothers show developmental delay and/or arrest during the earliest mitotic divisions. during these early mitotic divisions, d. melanogaster embryos are rapidly dividing in a syncytium and do not undergo transcription. consequently, the early mitotic cycles are under maternal genetic control. the defects observed in embryos produced from mfrz4070/mfrz <dig> mothers before cycle  <dig> suggest that mfr mrna and/or proteins are maternally deposited into the embryo and used during the early mitotic divisions. microdomains of ca2+ have been identified in d. melanogaster syncytial embryos undergoing mitosis  <cit>  and mfr may associate with these transient ca2+ signals that are critical for cell division.

for ferlin proteins, the contribution of individual c <dig> domains to ferlin function remains largely an unanswered question. in addition to biochemical analyses to address this question  <cit> , these studies and those of washington et al. using c. elegans  <cit>  show that genetic analysis provides a complimentary approach. for the c. elegans fer- <dig> gene, a predominance  of missense mutations were recovered. the location of these mutations within the c2c-, c2e-, and c2f-encoding domains suggested that each of these domains is important for fer- <dig> function, and that there is little functional redundancy among the c <dig> domains. in contrast, we recovered an unusually high proportion of mfr nonsense mutations , which may reflect functional redundancy among c <dig> domains within the mfr protein. alternatively, there may be functional redundancy among protein isoforms expressed in the same tissue, with the introduction of premature stop codons expected to have more general effects on isoform production. however, one critical difference between the c. elegans and d. melanogaster studies is that the majority of the c. elegans mutations were selected as temperature sensitive male sterile alleles, which precludes the recovery of nonsense mutations. for both organisms, now that the mutant phenotypes and gene structures are known, the function of c <dig> and other ferlin domains can be systematically tested. for instance, the effects of targeted disruptions of individual domains on phenotypes or the ability of individual isoforms to rescue mutant phenotypes can be evaluated.

finally, we note that while ferlin genes are expressed in the gonads and required for fertility in both d. melanogaster and c. elegans  <cit> , this gene family has not yet been implicated in fertility in mammals. to date, studies of mammalian ferlins have focused largely on tissues that show a disease phenotype caused by ferlin mutations and a role in the gonad has not been explored. however, ferlin transcripts have been detected in the testis and male germline of colts  <cit>  and mice  <cit> , and an antibody that recognizes mouse otof shows that this protein is located in the testis  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine if one or more of the mammalian ferlin proteins, like those in d. melanogaster and c. elegans, play a role in fertility. alternatively, ferlins whose original function in animal evolution may have been specific for the gonad, may have been co-opted for entirely new uses in mammals.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that a d. melanogaster ferlin gene is important for male and female fertility and carries out its functions using multiple testis and ovary promoters, alternatively spliced mrnas, and protein isoforms. genetic analysis of a spectrum of mfr mutations shows that expression in males is required for efficient breakdown of the sperm plasma membrane and completion of sperm activation during fertilization. in females, a subset of mfr mutations perturbs egg patterning by limiting the localization of gurken, a key ligand in this pathway, and delays the progression of maternally controlled stages of embryogenesis. these findings provide the first evidence for diverse roles of ferlins in both male and female reproduction and help establish d. melanogaster as model system to study the complex regulation and function of ferlins.
