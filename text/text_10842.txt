BACKGROUND
aromatic compounds, one of the most abundant classes of natural carbon compounds, accumulate primarily due to the degradation of plant-derived molecules . these structurally diverse compounds are independently converted to a small number of structurally simpler common intermediates, such as catechol and protocatechuate, which are subsequently metabolized to tricarboxylic acid intermediates via the β-ketoadipate pathway  <cit> . therefore, many soil bacteria are characterized by considerable metabolic flexibility and physiological adaptability with a minimum number of functional proteins.

the β-ketoadipate pathway for degradation of aromatic compounds is widely distributed among bacteria. in addition, the microbial degradation of aromatic compounds has tremendous environmental significance. therefore, the metabolic and genomic characteristics of the aromatic catabolic pathways from acinetobacter, pseudomonas, geobacterter and dechloromonas have been studied extensively  <cit> . for example, a. baylyi adp <dig>  and p. putida kt <dig> have long been used as a model for studying aromatic compound biodegradation and have contributed greatly to the elucidation of gene regulation of the β-ketoadipate pathway. in a. baylyi adp <dig>  the β-ketoadipate pathway consists of two parallel branches for the conversion of catechol and protocatechuate, which are derived from benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate, respectively  <cit> . at least  <dig> genes involved in the peripheral pathways for the catabolism of benzoate  and 4-hydroxybenzoate  and in the catechol  and protocatechuate  branches of the β-ketoadipate pathway have been identified in a. baylyi adp <dig>  <cit> . p. putida kt <dig> is another well-characterized bacterium capable of utilizing benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate  <cit> . genome sequence analysis of strain kt <dig> predicts the existence of the protocatechuate  and catechol  branches of the β-ketoadipate pathway  <cit> . further enzymatic studies and amino acid sequence data revealed that the pob, pca, ben and cat gene products are highly conserved in acinetobacter and pseudomonas strains. these products are usually synthesized in the presence of their respective substrates. two different regulatory proteins, an xyls-type benr in p. putida  <cit>  and a lysr-type benm in a. baylyi  <cit> , are known to be involved in activating the ben gene expression in response to benzoate. in most cases, benr/benm is necessary for the ben expression but not for the expression of the cat genes, which can be regulated by catr/catm  <cit> . for example, benr and catr jointly activate more than a dozen chromosomal ben and cat genes responsible for benzoate catabolism in p. putida  <cit> . thus, benr-catr or benm-catm regulation may serve as a practical model for complex regulatory circuits involved in the biodegradation of benzoate.

aromatic compounds are not preferred as growth substrates. in most cases, synthesis of the catabolic enzymes is reduced when certain rapidly metabolizable carbon sources are simultaneously present  <cit> . one such control mechanism is called catabolite repression, which can integrate different signals, thus increasing the complexity of the system  <cit> . although the molecular mechanism responsible for global control is not yet well understood, available data suggest that catabolite repression control  is a component of a signal transduction pathway that modulates carbon metabolism in some soil bacteria. in addition, crc has also been observed in several pseudomonas species  <cit> . very recently, a. baylyi crc was proposed to be involved in determining the transcript stability of the pca-qui operon, thereby mediating catabolite repression  <cit> .

the β-ketoadipate pathway is found almost exclusively in soil microorganisms, especially in pseudomonas species, emphasizing the importance of aromatic compound catabolism in this family  <cit> . establishment of the complete genome sequence of pseudomonas strains enabled mapping of the entire catabolic gene cluster in their chromosomes  <cit> . despite the current extensive knowledge about the aerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds in pseudomonas strains, there remains much more to understand. for instance, the large information gap between sequence information and function for genes responsible for aromatic catabolism is a major challenge to the field of functional genomics. in particular, the evolutionary and regulatory mechanisms of aromatic catabolic pathways in the nitrogen-fixing and root-associated bacteria have been poorly documented. p. stutzeri a <dig> was isolated from paddy soil in south china in the early 1980s for its ability to fix nitrogen under microaerobic conditions in the free-living state and to colonize rice endophytically  <cit> . as previously mentioned, aromatic compounds are highly abundant in the soil, so they can serve as a normal carbon source for a <dig> when this bacterium colonizes on root surfaces of host plants. in this study, genomic analysis showed that a <dig> contains sets of genes encoding enzymes and regulators involved in the biodegradation of benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate. herein, we present evidence that benzoate degradation is subject to catabolite repression control. we also describe, for the first time, that low concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzoate significantly enhance the ability of a <dig> to degrade benzoate.

RESULTS
genome-wide analysis of the aromatic catabolism pathways
p. stutzeri has recently received particular attention for its metabolic properties, including denitrification, degradation of aromatic compounds, and nitrogen fixation. since p. stutzeri a <dig> was originally isolated from paddy soil and because it contains sets of genes for the β-ketoadipate pathway, it should be able to utilize aromatic compounds. in our study, we observed that this strain can aerobically degrade benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate. as the complete genome of p. stutzeri a <dig> was sequenced recently  <cit> , we mapped the genes encoding the peripheral pathways for the catabolism of 4-hydroxybenzoate  and benzoate  in the a <dig> chromosome . in many soil bacteria, these peripheral pathway enzymes channel the individual substrates into one of the two branches of the β-ketoadipate pathway, namely the catechol and protocatechuate branches. sequence comparison indicated that a <dig> has genes encoding all of the enzymes involved in the two branches of the β-ketoadipate pathway. the catechol  and the protocatechuate branches  converge at β-ketoadipate enol-lactone. one set of enzymes, which are encoded by pcadijf, completes the conversion of β-ketoadipate enol-lactone to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates .

in the a <dig> genome, the cat genes are chromosomally linked with the ben genes and form an  <dig>  kb supercluster . the deduced amino acid sequence of benr in a <dig> shows high similarity  to the p. fluorescens pf- <dig> benr protein. however, the catr gene, which positively regulates the catbc and cata operons in other strains  <cit> , is absent in a <dig> . additionally, the pca genes in p. stutzeri a <dig> are contiguous, whereas the pca genes are scattered over several portions of the genome in other pseudomonas species, such as p. entomophila  <cit> , p. aeruginosa  <cit> , p. fluorescens  <cit> and p. putida  <cit>  . pcar is an icl family protein and has been reported to regulate most of the pca genes in the protocatechuate branch of the β-ketoadipate pathway in p. putida  <cit> . in contrast to other pseudomonas strains, pcar is located immediately upstream of pcai in a <dig> . the deduced amino acid sequence of a <dig> pcar shows 85% identity to that of p. putida kt <dig>  notably, the pcak gene, which encodes a 4-hydroxybenzoate permease responsible for 4-hydroxybenzoate transport  <cit> , is absent in a <dig> . the catabolic gene organization in a <dig> lacks the catr and pcak genes, a feature that is not observed in other pseudomonas strains.

functional characterization of the β-ketoadipate pathway
a <dig> grew well on  <dig> mm benzoate and reached an od <dig> of  <dig>  after  <dig> h of incubation, whereas no growth was observed in the presence of  <dig> mm benzoate. a <dig> grow poorly on  <dig>  mm 4-hydroxybenzoate, while 4-hydroxybenzoate at concentrations above  <dig>  mm completely inhibited bacterial growth . further investigation of the β-ketoadipate pathway was made by constructing and characterizing three mutants: benr mutant a <dig>  pcar mutant a <dig> and pcad mutant a <dig> . when the wild type and mutants were cultured in media containing lactate, their growth rates were not affected . as expected, the benr mutant failed to grow on benzoate, and the pcar and pcad mutants failed to grow on 4-hydroxybenzoate as the sole carbon source. furthermore, both the pcar and pcad mutants lost their ability to utilize benzoate as a carbon source. we constructed three complementary plasmids containing the entire pcad, pcar and benr genes for further growth complementation assays. complementation of the three mutants with the corresponding complementary plasmids restored the catabolic activity, and the three corresponding complementary strains grew on benzoate as the sole carbon source . results from gene disruption analyses and genetic complementation tests demonstrate that the three genes are required for the growth of a <dig> on benzoate.

high-performance liquid chromatography  was used to measure the concentrations of catechol and muconate in the culture supernatants of the wild type a <dig> and pcad mutant a <dig> grown on benzoate as the sole carbon source . during the initial phase of benzoate catabolism by a <dig>  small amounts of catechol  and cis, cis-muconate  were detected. after  <dig> h, benzoate was completely removed from the culture supernatants, and no metabolites could be detected . the inability of the pcad mutant a <dig> to grow on benzoate was further confirmed by hplc analysis of culture supernatants. after  <dig> h, the concentration of benzoate remained almost unchanged in the culture supernatant of the mutant, while accumulation of catechol and cis, cis-muconate was detected by hplc . as shown in figure 1b, inactivation of pcad completely blocked the conversion of β-ketoadipate enol-lactone to β-ketoadipate, resulting in accumulation of the intermediates catechol and cis, cis-muconate derived from benzoate. these results provide experimental evidence that the two branches of the β-ketoadipate pathway converge at β-ketoadipate enol-lactone and that the products of pcadijf complete the conversion of the latter to tca cycle intermediates in p. stutzeri a <dig>  as documented in other pseudomonas strains  <cit> .

a ben++, good growth on benzoate; cat++, good growth on catechol; 4hba+, weak growth on 4-hydroxybenzoate; ben-, no growth on benzoate; cat-, no growth on catechol; 4hba-, no growth on 4-hydroxybenzoate; kmr, kanamycin resistant; tcr, tetracycline resistant.

as mentioned above, a <dig> can grow well on benzoate, but not on 4-hydroxybenzoate, as the sole carbon and energy source. therefore, we focused on the genetic organization of the a <dig> ben-cat region. as shown in figure 5a, nine ben and cat genes are in the same transcriptional orientation and the lengths of the intergenic regions vary. gene expression was further studied by amplifying intergenic regions between adjacent genes. eight pairs of oligonucleotide primers were designed . as shown in figure 5b, in the presence of benzoate, four products of their expected sizes were amplified with the pf/pr primer pairs spanning the borders of bena-benb , benb-benc , benc-bend , and catb-catc . no pcr products were observed with the pf/pr primer pairs spanning the borders of benr-bena , bend-benk , benk-catb , and catc-cata  in the presence or absence of benzoate. these results suggest that nine benzoate metabolic genes are organized in five transcriptional units. in particular, the catbc genes are co-transcribed in the presence of benzoate.

apcr reactions were carried out with the sets of primers indicated to the left.

benr activates expression of the benabcd operon in responseto benzoate
in pseudomonads, benzoate catabolism is initiated by the benabcd operon encoding benzoate dioxygenase  and 2-hydro- <dig> -dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase , whose expression is positively regulated by benr  <cit> . in this study, we found that disruption of the benr gene resulted in a simultaneous loss of the ability to utilize benzoate, but this mutant could grow on catechol, suggesting that benr might be the sole activator of expression of benabc in a <dig>  to confirm this, we searched the promoter sequence of bena using in silico analysis. the nucleotide sequence upstream of the benabcd operon has the following sequence features: a putative -10/-35-type promoter, a putative benr-binding region, and a predicted translational start site . comparison with the experimentally well-characterized benr-binding sequences in p. putida  <cit>  indicated a highly conserved benr site in the promoter region of the a <dig> bena gene . to determine whether benr is required for activation of the pbena promoter, the expression level of the benabcd operon was tested in the benr mutant a <dig>  quantitative real-time pcr results demonstrated that a significant increase in transcription from the pbenapromoter was seen in wild-type a <dig> when benzoate was included in the growth medium, whereas the addition of catechol or cis,cis-muconate had a very weak effect . when benr was absent, transcription from the pbena promoter was highly repressed, irrespective of the presence or absence of the inducer . as reported in p. putida  <cit> , these results led us to conclude that the benabcd operon is under the control of benr in response to benzoate in a <dig> 

benzoate-mediated induction of the catbc operon in a1501
in p. putida, the catbc operon encodes cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme i  and muconolactone isomerase , which catalyze the second and third steps of the catechol branch of the β-ketoadipate pathway, respectively  <cit> . the transcription of this operon requires catr and cis,cis-muconate  <cit> . additionally, the translational starts of catr and catbc are separated by  <dig> bp of intervening dna containing -35/-10-type promoters and the catr-binding sites in p. putida  <cit> . however, we found that only  <dig> nucleotides are present in the noncoding regions between benk and catb in a <dig>  suggesting that the promoter region of the catbc operon overlaps with the coding region of the benk gene. the promoter region of the catbc operon from a <dig> shows very low similarity to those of the three other pseudomonas strains, notably the lack of the typical binding site for catr present in the catb promoter region of other pseudomonas strains . although a catr orthologue could not be identified in a <dig>  quantitative real-time pcr experiments indicated that benzoate has the strongest induction effect on expression of the catbc operon . since benzoate induces expression of catb in the benr mutant background and this mutant is unable to metabolize benzoate, we proposed that induction of the catbc expression is not due to the production of benzoate metabolites, such as cis,cis-muconate. as reported in p. putida, induction of the catbc operon requires cis,cis-muconate, an intermediate of benzoate degradation, and catr, a well-studied activator in the β-ketoadipate pathway  <cit> . however, benzoate itself has a significant induction effect on expression of the catbc operon in a <dig>  strongly suggesting the existence of an uncharacterized regulatory mechanism.

benzoate degradation in a <dig> is subject to carbon catabolite repression
in pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains, the crc global regulator controls the expression of genes involved in benzoate degradation when other preferred carbon sources are present in the culture medium  <cit> . based on sequence comparison, we found a crc-like protein in the a <dig> genome . the a <dig> crc-like protein shows highest amino acid identity with p. aeruginosa crc , whereas relatively low amino acid identity  is observed between a <dig> and a. baylyi crc proteins.

benzoate degradation by a <dig> involves the oxidation of benzoate into catechol in a two-step process catalyzed by benabc and bend, two peripheral pathway enzymes of the catechol pathway. the catechol aromatic ring is converted by the action of cata, catb and catc to cis,cis-muconate, and then to β-ketoadipate-enol-lactone, which is transformed into acetyl-coa and succinyl-coa by pcad, pcaij, and pcaf from the β-ketoadipate pathway. therefore, the bena, catb, and pcad genes were selected for further analysis. in the presence of the inducer benzoate, highly significant differences in expression were observed, depending on the nature of the non-inducing carbon source . the expression of the three selected genes was most efficiently induced by benzoate when cells were grown on lactate and succinate alone, but was decreased significantly when the carbon source was glucose or acetate . when cells grew on lactate, the expression of bena and catb was efficiently induced by benzoate, respectively; when glucose plus succinate was used as the carbon source, induction was significantly lower . the bena and catb genes showed a similar repression pattern to the pcad gene, with the slight difference being that acetate was an intermediate-repressing carbon source. using glucose or succinate as individual carbon sources led to a strong decreasing or increasing effect on expression of the pcad gene, respectively, whereas growth on a combination of glucose plus succinate and inducer resulted in high induction . these results suggest that benzoate degradation in a <dig> is subject to carbon catabolite repression. our experimental evidence, combined with the identification of the crc-like protein in a <dig>  may be indicative of distinct activities of crc at different genes or in various bacteria, as previously shown in a. baylyi and p. putida  <cit> . further experiments are required to construct an a <dig> mutant lacking the crc-like protein and to investigate role of this protein in carbon catabolite repression.

4-hydroxybenzoate enhances the ability of a <dig> to degrade benzoate
a study reported that high concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons are harmful to cells because they disrupt membrane components  <cit> . in the plate assay, a <dig> grew extremely poorly on 4-hydroxybenzoate as the sole carbon source with colonies of less than  <dig>  mm in diameter after  <dig> days, whereas it produced normal-sized colonies  on benzoate alone in the same period. these results indicate that 4-hydroxybenzoate itself directly inhibits a <dig> growth, which is likely caused by the toxicity of 4-hydroxybenzoate. it is unclear whether the lack of pcak results in the loss of 4-hydroxybenzoate transport, leaving a <dig> unable to metabolize 4-hydroxybenzoate efficiently. in subsequent experiments, growth of a <dig> was examined in a mixture of  <dig> mm benzoate and  <dig>  mm 4-hydroxybenzoate. a <dig> showed a shorter lag phase and a higher growth rate when cells were grown on the mixture than when benzoate was supplied alone . furthermore, under the latter growth conditions, the culture gradually became dark brown in color because of autoxidation of the accumulated catechol . however, when the 4-hydroxybenzoate concentration increased to  <dig>  mm, growth of a <dig> was completely inhibited . these results indicate that 4-hydroxybenzoate at low concentrations can enhance the ability of a <dig> to grow on benzoate.

we then evaluated the effect of 4-hydroxybenzoate on the metabolism of benzoate using hplc. when  <dig> mm benzoate alone was provided to the culture, it was completely consumed within  <dig> h, and metabolic intermediates were present. when  <dig> mm benzoate and  <dig>  mm 4-hydroxybenzoate were provided together as growth substrates, benzoate was completely consumed within  <dig> h, while no discernible loss of 4-hydroxybenzoate was detected . additionally, analysis of the intracellular metabolites by hplc revealed accumulation of catechol derived from benzoate both in the presence and absence of 4-hydroxybenzoate in the growth medium. the concentration of catechol reached  <dig>  mm when a <dig> grew on benzoate alone, whereas the concentration of catechol reached approximately  <dig>  mm when both benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate were in the growth medium . collectively, these results suggest that 4-hydroxybenzoate can significantly enhance the ability of a <dig> not only to degrade benzoate, but also to remove the catechol accumulated from benzoate.

discussion
the data presented here reveal that the sequence and organization of the ben, pob, cat, and pca genes in a <dig> are very similar to those within other well-studied pseudomonas strains, raising the question of whether these genes have common origins. increasing evidence indicates that horizontal gene transfer is an efficient mechanism for introducing catabolic pathways into different bacterial genomes  <cit> . in general, recently acquired transferable genomic regions are associated with insertion sequence elements and mobility-related genes, whereas anciently acquired genomic regions may lose these genetic elements  <cit> . furthermore, horizontally acquired dna regions are usually chromosomally inserted in the vicinity of trna or rrna genes  <cit> . we also discovered that an rrna operon is located directly downstream of the ben gene cluster and that a trna-gly gene is located downstream of the pca gene cluster. although insertion sequence elements and mobility-related genes are absent, the packing of the catabolic pathway genes as well as the difference in the g+c % content from the rest of the genome favor the hypothesis that the β-ketoadipate pathway in a <dig> is acquired from horizontal gene transfer, which contributes to an increased adaptability in the soil environment.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the gene arrangement of the ben, cat, and pca clusters differs between different bacteria. apparently, various dna rearrangements have occurred during its evolution in each particular host. furthermore, we observed the lack of the catr and pcak genes, a distinguishing feature of the catabolic gene organization in a <dig>  suggesting that gene deletion events responsible for the loss of the two genes have occurred over a long period of evolution. in most cases, the complex regulatory circuits involving the two sets of transcriptional regulators, benr/benm and catr/catm, have evolved to allow optimal expression of catabolic genes  <cit> . unlike p. putida in which the transcription of the catbc operon requires catr and cis,cis-muconate  <cit> , we could not identify a catr orthologue or a consensus sequence typical of catr-dependent promoters in a <dig>  in particular, benzoate, but not cis,cis-muconate, has a significant induction effect on the expression of the catbc operon in a <dig>  therefore, we propose that an uncharacterized regulatory mechanism might be involved in the regulation of the β-ketoadipate pathway in a <dig>  but this hypothesis requires further investigation.

a <dig> contains all of the enzymes involved in the 4-hydroxybenzoate degradation pathway. however, this strain shows extremely poor growth on 4-hydroxybenzoate as the sole carbon source. a plausible explanation for this observation is due to the lack of pcak, a 4-hydroxybenzoate transporter, thereby leaving a <dig> unable to metabolize 4-hydroxybenzoate efficiently. in most cases, the pcak mutation had a negative effect on bacterial 4-hydroxybenzoate uptake and growth. for example, mutants blocked in 4-hydroxybenzoate transport have been identified in two biovars of rhizobium leguminosarum  <cit> . growth of these mutants was completely blocked when cultured on 4-hydroxybenzoate. by contrast, growth of the p. putida pcak mutant was not significantly impaired on 4-hydroxybenzoate at neutral ph  <cit> . furthermore, repression of 4-hydroxybenzoate transport and degradation by benzoate has been reported in p. putida  <cit> . unexpectedly, our results indicate that low concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzoate significantly enhance the ability of a <dig> to degrade benzoate, potentially due to 4-hydroxybenzoate-mediated induction of enzymes, such as pcad, required for dissimilation of benzoate by the β-ketoadipate pathway. pesticides and industrial wastes often contain aromatic constituents, including many that are toxic to living organisms. the degradation of aromatic compound mixtures has recently received a great deal of attention. to our knowledge, this is the first report of enhanced benzoate degradation by 4-hydroxybenzoate, highlighting its potential physiological significance. the metabolic capacity for utilizing different aromatic compounds as carbon or energy sources confers a selective advantage, notably for exposure to a mixture of aromatic compounds. the findings obtained from this study will help to investigate novel regulatory mechanisms and catabolic activities that can be of great biotechnological interest for improving the microbial degradation of aromatic environmental pollutants.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that a <dig> contains sets of genes encoding enzymes and regulators responsible for the entire benzoate or 4-hydroxybenzoate-degrading pathways. the unique features found in the a <dig> catabolic pathway are not just rearrangements of structural genes but represent the existence of an uncharacterized regulatory mechanism and the lack of catr, a well-studied activator in other benzoate-degrading bacteria. we also described for the first time that low concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzoate significantly enhance the ability of a <dig> to degrade benzoate. more extensive studies are needed to fully understand mechanisms involved in the regulation of cat genes and to further improve the ability of a <dig> to degrade aromatic environmental pollutants.
