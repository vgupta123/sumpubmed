BACKGROUND
during the last decade, molecular phylogenetics based on the comparative analysis of markers from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes allowed for the revision of mammalian systematics  <cit> . sequencing efforts initially focused on mitochondrial dna  due to the availability of conserved primers, the presence of rapidly evolving sites, and a reduced effective population size inducing the rapid fixation of variants between subsequent speciation events. some protein-coding genes such as cytochrome b  have emerged as central tools in investigating intraspecific  to ordinal-level  evolutionary relationships. to date , ca.  <dig>  complete cyb entries are available for mammals in public data bases, and furthermore, another mitochondrial gene – the cytochrome c oxidase i – has been proposed as the marker for animal dna barcoding  <cit> . however, the strong nucleotide saturation encountered at third codon positions as well as a high sensitivity to taxon sampling soon caused the questioning of the utility of mitochondrial protein-coding genes in general, and cyb in particular for resolving deep phylogenies  <cit> . owing to their different evolutionary patterns – a less biased base composition and lower saturation than mitochondrial genes  <cit>  – nuclear genes have represented a reasonable alternative to mtdna for reconstructing deep-level mammalian phylogenies . by providing complementary information, mitochondrial and nuclear genes are thus generally employed at different levels, low-level phylogeny and taxonomy for the former, and deeper-level for the latter.

several mtdna-based studies of mammalian systematics have shed light on the difficulties experienced in using cyb to resolve phylogenies at lower taxonomic levels. several works at the family level recovered multifurcations among genera or even species, which led to the conclusion of rapid, near-simultaneous divergences of multiple lineages , without any time left for synapomorphies to accumulate in mtdna. this interpretation has been put forward for some speciose clades of rodents, such as ctenomyidae  <cit> , echimyidae  <cit> , or sigmodontinae  <cit> . the star-phylogeny hypothesis was also supported by the lack of resolution for relationships among genera, contrasting with well-defined nodes above and below multifurcations  <cit> . however, an alternative hypothesis suggests that cyb sequences have undergone substitution saturation throughout the course of speciation events, leading to a loss of the original phylogenetic signal, and producing a soft-polytomy  <cit> . in this case, the use of slower-evolving nuclear dna  might represent a better choice for resolving such recent radiations. supporting this hypothesis, sequences from such markers, either exons or introns, have recently improved among-families  <cit> , or even among-genera  <cit>  phylogenetics of spiny rats, squirrels, whales, weasels, and spiral-horn antelopes.

in the present study, we focused on the evolutionary history of voles, lemmings, and muskrats. these animals belong to the arvicolinae, one of the six cricetidae subfamilies of the highly-diverse muroidea, which encompasses one third of all rodent species. the arvicolinae represent themselves one of the most impressive placental radiations in the northern hemisphere, consisting of  <dig> species and  <dig> genera  <cit> . as stated by  <cit> , the explosiveness and recency of arvicoline evolution can be dramatically highlighted by the more than  <dig> species of microtus and the inconsistency of their systematic treatment. phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial sequences  provided unresolved topologies at two different levels:  among arvicoline genera, and  among species of microtus  <cit> . these results reinforced observations previously made by paleontologists  <cit>  who concluded that two successive pulses of speciation occurred during the evolutionary course of arvicoline rodents over the last  <dig> million years .

following the encouraging results from recent studies  <cit> , we thus compared the relative contribution of a nuclear marker – exon  <dig> of the growth hormone receptor  gene – to one of the mitochondrial cyb for inferring phylogenetic relationships among major arvicolinae lineages. we performed analyses in a probability framework because  maximum likelihood  and bayesian methods are indeed based upon explicit models of sequence evolution,  they allow the definition of independent models to reflect the contrasting substitution patterns among the three codon positions of ghr and cyb, and  they have proven to be robust to a number of systematic biases during phylogenetic reconstruction  <cit> . in addition to such inter-sites comparisons, we evaluated the amount of saturation at each codon position. using the variable-length bootstrap method, we also estimated the amount of sites required by mitochondrial, cyb-like, and nuclear, ghr-like data to resolve recent and deeper nodes of the evolution of voles and lemmings.

RESULTS
 <dig>  mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies of the arvicolinae
 contribution of cyb
both bayesian and ml dna analyses provide poorly resolved phylogenies, with most of arvicoline genera and most of microtus species arising from a polytomy . only three nodes benefit from strong support , four are moderately supported , whereas the  <dig> remaining nodes do not receive significant support. the three clades unambiguously identified  involve:  both myodes species included in our analysis: m. glareolus and m. andersoni;  neodon irene + phaiomys leucurus; and  microtus  arvalis + m.  guentheri. at the amino acids level, only  <dig> % of the cyb sites are parsimony informative among arvicolines, and, as already observed by  <cit> , the corresponding topology is not resolved .

 contribution of ghr exon 10
branching patterns recovered with ml and bayesian methods are identical. ghr sequences provide much more resolved topologies  than those based upon cyb sequences, with eight strongly and four moderately supported nodes. all clades previously identified in the cyb tree are recovered with higher support, excepted for the sister-clade relationship between microtus arvalis and m. guentheri not found in ghr trees. a better resolution involves all taxonomic levels from internal suprageneric relationships to intra-microtus nodes . new, well-supported clades include:  the monophyly of the subgenus alexandromys ;  the monophyly of a microtus sensu lato clade  but excluding chionomys;  the grouping of arvicola + chionomys + microtus s.l.;  the association of eothenomys with myodes ; and  a sister-clade relationship between myodini and arvicolini. at the amino acids level,  <dig> % of the ghr sites are parsimony informative among arvicolines, and the corresponding topology is poorly resolved .

we also scanned the ghr alignment for potential indel signatures. a 3-bp deletion at position  <dig>  of the ghr sequence of rattus norvegicus  is diagnostic for the monophyly of arvicolinae. a 3-bp in-frame insertion – a direct agc repeat – at position  <dig>  of rattus norvegicus  is shared by neodon + phaiomys, and independently by blanfordimys + lasiopodomys.

independent paleontological and molecular studies respectively estimated that divergence times among some arvicoline genera occurred 3– <dig> myr ago   <cit>  to 5– <dig> mya  <cit> . the adaptive radiation of microtus has been dated to approximately  <dig> myr by most paleontologists  <cit>  but there is molecular evidence for splits between  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya  <cit> . the ghr topology is here more resolved than the cyb one for intergeneric speciation events, corresponding to mean uncorrected pairwise divergences of  <dig>  % ±  <dig>   versus  <dig>  % ±  <dig>  . for the 2– <dig> myr old microtus radiation, corresponding to divergences of  <dig> % ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  % ±  <dig>  , the ghr topology is at least as resolved as the cyb one. these results emphasize previous conclusions  <cit>  that highlighted the superiority of nuclear genes over mitochondrial genes even for divergences spanning the last 5– <dig> myr.

 combination of cyb and ghr genes
bayesian and ml analyses of the concatenation of mitochondrial and nuclear data sets provide highly congruent and globally well-resolved topologies, very similar to the ones based upon ghr alone. nevertheless, increased support values are generally recorded. thus, nine nodes are strongly supported and six are moderately supported. the newly recovered associations involve nodes labeled h, b, c, p, and q :  chionomys sister-group of microtus s.l. with arvicola placed at the base of arvicolini;  prometheomys emerging first within arvicolinae;  dicrostonyx + phenacomys;  a clade, only supported in the bayesian analysis , and uniting five microtus species: m.  ochrogaster, m.  richardsoni, m. chrotorrhinus, m.  pennsylvanicus, and m. longicaudus;  microtus  pennsylvanicus sister-group of microtus longicaudus.

clades moderately to strongly supported in the ghr tree data benefit from similar support values after the combination of ghr and cyb sequences. actually, a substantial increase of support is found for nodes defining the basal position of prometheomys, and the monophyly of microtus s.l. is reinforced. on the opposite, the sister-clade relationship recovered between myodini and arvicolini is less supported in the combined tree than in the ghr one. expectedly, the m. arvalis + m. guentheri clade, recovered by cyb data, is similarly supported in the combination.

to summarize, the combination of cyb and ghr sequences provides a phylogeny where two-third of the nodes benefit from a medium to high support . the addition of nuclear sequences also allows the division of a single, multi-taxa polytomy into two noticeably smaller multifurcations. the first includes arvicolini, ondatra, lemmus, dicrostonyx, and phenacomys, although the latter two genera are consistently found as sister-group across the different reconstructions performed. the second multifurcation includes phylogenetic relationships among microtus s.l. subclades with evidence for a deeper divergence of the neodon + phaiomys lineage.

 <dig>  systematics of voles, lemmings, and muskrats
 interrelationships of major genera
for the first time, and contrary to phylogenies based on mitochondrial data alone  <cit> , the use of a nuclear dna exon sheds light on the systematics of arvicoline rodents. the validation of the arvicolini tribe is one of the most striking results. the molecular evidence for a clade including arvicola, chionomys, and microtus s.l.  – with the water vole emerging at first – agrees with paleontology. actually, the genera microtus and chionomys are supposed to be linked to allophaiomys which represents an early split from the lineage mimomys that led to arvicola  <cit> . our results concur with other research  <cit>  that red-backed voles form a complex of closely related species as suggested by the strong support recovered for the grouping of myodes,  with eothenomys.

in addition, a first molecular evidence is here provided for the phylogenetic position of enigmatic genera suspected to have differentiated early within the arvicoline radiation. the long-clawed mole-vole, prometheomys, currently localised in the caucasus mountains, was considered as a relic of an archaic lineage formerly widespread throughout most of eurasia  <cit> . this view is corroborated by its first emergence in the ghr and combined phylogenetic trees . the collared lemming, dicrostonyx as well as the heather vole, phenacomys, exhibit plesiomorphic morphological traits which have compromised their systematic affiliation to other arvicolines. dicrostonyx was initially grouped with true lemmings whereas phenacomys was included in either arvicolini or myodini  <cit> . by obtaining a moderately supported sister-taxa relationship between dicrostonyx and phenacomys, our study is in accordance with previous result from the analysis of highly repetitive dna  elements  <cit> . although unexpected, this clade might find a biogeographical explanation as these two taxa are primarily known – from a palaeontological viewpoint – in the arctic region of eurasia and north america  <cit> .

to summarize our results from a taxonomic standpoint, the phylogenetic relationships discussed above agree with the tribal recognition of lemmini , ondatrini , dicrostonychini , phenacomyini , prometheomyini , myodini  and arvicolini   <cit> .

 systematics of microtus
thanks to the sampling of new taxa and nuclear dna data, our phylograms helped to test the accuracy of systematic treatment of microtus taxa and close genera. some taxa – blanfordimys, chionomys, lasiopodomys, neodon, phaiomys – have indeed been split from microtus because they retain distinctive and plesiomorphic morphological/caryological traits  <cit> . however, except for chionomys , other taxa are interspersed among "true" microtus lineages in our nuclear or combined topologies, giving no support to their generic recognition.

actually, three lineages are clearly identified within microtus. firstly, strong evidence is provided for a neodon + phaiomys subgenera clade, contradicting former studies  <cit>  which, using molar and other external and cranial contrasts, rejected any close phylogenetic affinity between them. secondly, microtus kikuchii, m. oeconomus, and m. middendorffi form a well-supported association. independent source of phylogenetic data – here nuclear ghr sequences – thus confirm the "asian lineage" recently identified on the basis of mitochondrial phylogenies and chromosomal data  <cit> , as well as the monophyly of the subgenus alexandromys, as redefined in  <cit> . the five nearctic species included in our analysis and representatives of various subgenera  are associated with some support in the combined analysis. the recognition of an american clade within microtus strengthens previous results from biochemical analyses  <cit>  and mitochondrial phylogenies  <cit> . third, some support for a terricola + microtus clade is recovered, suggesting close phylogenetic affinities among western palaearctic taxa, and reinforcing the conclusions of  <cit> .

 <dig>  compared molecular evolution of cyb and ghr in arvicolines
 characteristics of substitution patterns
nucleotide substitutions appear to accumulate in cyb and ghr according to contrasted patterns. cyb evolves at a high rate,  <dig>  times faster than ghr does as indicated by the total branch length of ml phylograms. moreover, as expected for a mitochondrial protein-coding gene  <cit> , table  <dig> indicates that cyb:  has a base composition that greatly deviates from uniformity due to an important deficit of g  and an excess of c and a  ;  is characterized by strong biases in relative substitution rates, with an excess of transitions over transversions, notably due to a higher frequency of c-t changes ;  shows a stronger rate heterogeneity among sites, with a Γ shape parameter  lower than the one of ghr . these patterns reflect the fact that most of cyb substitutions occur on third codon positions and are generally synonymous.

number of sites, base composition , relative gtr substitution rate parameters , and gamma shape parameter  are given, with mean values on first sublines, and 95% credibility intervals, italicized on second sublines. parameter estimates are also measured for each codon position, and are recapitulated in columns  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

 contrasted substitution patterns among codon positions
as generally pointed out for nuclear genes relative to mitochondrial ones, ghr exhibited a less contrasted substitution pattern during its evolutionary course. for instance, more heterogeneity among codon partitions is observed for cyb relative to ghr for two parameter sets.  evolutionary rates – as measured by total branch lengths  on ml phylograms – are highly heterogeneous among cyb codon positions, with cyb <dig>  evolving respectively about  <dig> and  <dig> times faster than cyb <dig> , and cyb <dig> . on the contrary, evolutionary rates are moderately contrasted among ghr codon positions, with ghr <dig>  evolving three times faster than ghr <dig>  and ghr <dig> .  base composition also appears more heterogeneous among cyb codon positions , with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of g for cyb <dig> and cyb <dig> respectively. by contrast, only ghr <dig> shows such a low value of g . an excess of t in cyb <dig>  and a in cyb <dig>  is also noticed. moreover, all ghr codon positions pass the 1% chi-square test that compares the nucleotide composition of each sequence to the frequency distribution assumed in the ml model, whereas microtus oeconomus and m.middendorffi cyb third codon positions violate it.

 partitioned likelihood analyses
the marked differences of base composition and evolutionary dynamics observed among cyb and ghr codon positions led us to apply the partitioned likelihood approach  <cit>  in order to evaluate their impact on model fit . for both cyb and ghr, the aics for partitioned models are the lowest, confirming a gain in log-likelihood when an independent set of parameters is attributed to each codon position. actually, aics indicate that all sets of parameters for cyb are contrasted enough among codon positions to have an impact on model fit . more precisely, the greater increase of log-likelihood values is due, in decreasing order of impact, to variable rates between sites , to variable evolutionary rates along branches , to variable base compositions , and to variable gtr substitution rates . by contrast, for ghr sequences, aics indicate that only bc and Γ have a significant impact on model fit, whereas the incorporation of free gtr and bl parameters for each of the three codon positions induces the over-parametrization of such models . these analyses confirm that there is more heterogeneity among cyb codon partitions than among ghr partitions.

in the simplest model – without codon partition–, a single set of base composition , substitution rate , among-sites rate heterogeneity , and branch length  parameters is used, irrespective of the cyb and ghr codon positions. in the most complex model, one independent set of bc, gtr, Γ, and bl parameters is attributed to each codon position of either cyb or ghr. for intermediate models, the effect of giving a set of either bc, gtr, Γ, or bl parameters to each codon partition is measured through the aic . the best, i.e., lowest, aic are in bold for each gene.

 <dig>  identification of promising nucleotide sites for arvicoline phylogenetics
although some studies have elucidated the limited phylogenetic utility of individual nuclear genes at low taxonomic level because of their low variability  <cit> , we provide here a well-resolved ghr tree among arvicolinae. we will now explore why ghr performs better than cyb for deeper nodes – the inter-generic arvicoline radiation –, and also provides increased support to more recent nodes – the microtus sublineages.

 localization of the phylogenetic signal among codon positions
the analysis of the contribution of each codon partition to node resolution reveals that ghr <dig> holds the most informative sites . ghr <dig> sites recover most of the nodes with strong support, especially within the intergeneric radiation. although its phylogenetic signal generally appears slightly lower for the last  <dig> myr divergences , globally, ghr <dig> remains the most informative partition. ghr <dig> and cyb <dig> contribute much less than ghr <dig> to overall resolution but hold some support  for ca. one-third of the nodes. on the contrary, other partitions – cyb <dig> and, especially, cyb <dig> and ghr <dig> – are not informative for intra-arvicolinae relationships as reflected by exceedingly low bootstrap scores . with respect to nodes that are revealed or are more strongly supported by the combination of cyb and ghr , we notice that no partition is superior in resolution ability with a weak signal being shared by all codon positions.

node lettering refers to figure  <dig>  stars correspond to bootstrap scores inferior to 5% for the corresponding node under the codon partition analyzed.

 substitution saturation through time
the lack of phylogenetic signal at high taxon level often recorded by mitochondrial sequences has been considered as a direct consequence of substitution saturation . we thus evaluated the saturation level of each codon partition by plotting the pairwise observed substitutions between the  <dig> sequences as a function of the pairwise number of substitutions inferred on the ml tree . under this graphical representation, cyb <dig> appears extremely saturated , suggesting that high levels of nucleotidic saturation may be reached for speciation events more recent than 5– <dig> ma. this trend is perhaps here exaggerated by the fast evolutionary rate of muroid rodent sequences  <cit> . multiple substitutions also occur at cyb <dig>  whereas analyses for cyb <dig>  and all ghr codon positions  do not reveal significant saturation as detected by ml. codon partitions can thus be categorized into three classes corresponding to  highly saturated and weakly informative sites ;  less saturated and weakly informative sites ;  less saturated and strongly informative sites .

 the efficiency of ghr third codon positions
by comparing contribution to node resolution, saturation level, and evolutionary patterns inherent to each codon partition, it becomes possible to determine the characteristics of informative versus uninformative molecular sites. we thus realize that ghr <dig> differed from uninformative cyb <dig>  ghr <dig>  and ghr <dig> partitions by a faster evolution rate . in contrast, cyb <dig> and cyb <dig> partitions are much less informative than ghr <dig> despite higher evolutionary rates that would have allowed the accumulation of a larger number of synapomorphies. a high substitution rate thus appears detrimental too, having been more likely to have led to saturation . moreover, strong biases in base composition and gtr substitutions could also favour substitutional saturation. for instance, although cyb <dig> and ghr <dig> share similar evolutionary properties  – cyb <dig> is more affected by multiple substitutions because of either a slightly higher evolutionary rate or an excess of c-t over a-g transitions. our study therefore suggests that third codon positions of ghr are the most suitable sites for resolving the recent evolutionary radiation of arvicoline rodents. the higher efficiency of ghr <dig> is a result of the trade-off in evolutionary rate, rapid enough to accumulate synapomorphies, yet slow enough to remain unaffected by saturation.

 <dig>  perspectives: which markers to be used for resolving the arvicoline radiation?

the resolved ghr tree is perhaps a first step in challenging the hypothesis of a hard-polytomy for arvicolinae genera. as shown for other placental taxa – spiral-horn antelopes  <cit> , hares  <cit> , or bears  <cit>  – our results suggest that phylogenetic signal has been progressively obliterated by higher mtdna rates whereas it has persisted in at least one slower-evolving nuclear gene. however, the ghr gene tree is based on a single nuclear locus , and it does not necessarily reflect the organismal history of arvicoline rodents. actually, the resolution of the polytomy is further complicated by the eventual incongruence of individual gene trees with species trees due to incomplete lineage sorting  <cit> . consequently, the comparison of multiple gene trees is the only way to get a central tendency which could be interpreted as the species tree  <cit> . if multiple gene trees agree on a phylogenetic structure, we could then definitively dismiss the star-phylogeny hypothesis for the arvicolinae. in addition to allowing us to make predictions on the amount of cyb/ghr data required to decipher the phylogeny of the arvicolinae, variable length bootstrap analyses help us to identify which kind of markers should be considered for further sequencing.

 the not-so-evil mitochondrial dna
four examples of vlb curves are provided on figure 4: two represent deeper  nodes, moderately  to strongly  supported in the ghr + cyb tree, and two others correspond to more recent  nodes, moderately  to strongly  supported in the combined topology. for most nodes , the resampling of more cyb sites does not induce an increase of bootstrap support. despite using a ml model for vlb analyses which better accommodates base composition bias and among-site rate heterogeneity, cyb sequences do not appear more efficient than in other studies focusing on comparable taxonomic levels  <cit> . thus, the analysis of more data holding the same evolutionary properties as cyb might not bring more overall resolution.

the lack of phylogenetic signal as well as strong saturation and large among-sites heterogeneity questions the utility of cyb sequences for investigating phylogenetic relationships among taxa, like voles and lemmings, which have experienced relatively recent and rapid radiations. actually, we concur with others  <cit>  on the usefulness of cyb sequences – including third codon positions – when they are combined with less saturated sequences. firstly, we have shown that cyb sometimes holds phylogenetic signal for specific nodes where ghr is non-informative . although our study mainly focuses on intergeneric phylogenetic relationships, we could expect that cyb contribution would increase with nodes younger than  <dig> myr. secondly, vlb curves clearly indicate that data combination  provides slightly higher bootstrap support than does ghr alone, especially when the number of resampled sites is higher than  <dig>  . results of vlb analysis and comparisons of ghr and combined topologies show that the cyb signal does not contradict the ghr one. moreover, the incorporation of cyb data to nuclear data does not lead to the degradation of phylogenetic signal but slightly improves it, revealing the existence of weak and initially hidden information within cyb. because complete mitochondrial genomes include sequences undergoing various evolutionary pressures , and are available for an increasing number of taxa, particularly among mammals, we suggest the evaluation of their ability to resolve rapid radiations at low taxonomic level  <cit> , and a comparison of their efficiency to that of nuclear loci.

 the virtues of nuclear dna
as exemplified in figure  <dig>  ghr performs better than cyb for most nodes, irrespective of the age of the node. more generally, vlb curves indicate a higher efficiency of ghr relative to cyb sequences for nearly all nodes, i.e., they recover nodes with higher bootstrap support with a lower number of resampled sites. even for weakly supported nodes in our initial analyses of ca.  <dig> ghr sites, only  <dig>  to  <dig>  ghr additional sites are needed to increase bp values up to 70% or more. we may thus expect a significant improvement in nodal support through the sequencing of nuclear data in an order of magnitude three to five times greater than the size of ghr exon  <dig>  as vlb applies the resampling of sites holding the same phylogenetic signal as ghr, this method may provide conservative predictions on the impact of further sequencing on the overall resolution of the arvicoline phylogenetic tree. by adding nuclear data sampled from different loci, we could expect an improvement in node resolution  <cit> , in particular for nodes not well-supported by ghr data alone . since genetically independent loci have undergone different substitutional pressures, they may provide complementary resolution of the species tree, and increase the chance of finding molecular synapomorphies that resolve every node  <cit> . furthermore, we predict that introns might be equally as efficient for retracing the phylogeny of voles and lemmings – as recently shown for similar recent evolutionary radiations  <cit>  – because of their relaxed substitution constraints and their potentially greater number of informative sites.

CONCLUSIONS
the nuclear exon  <dig> of the ghr performs better than the mitochondrial cyb for resolving arvicolinae phylogenetic relationships. support is found for a sister-group relationship between red-backed voles  and a clade including water , snow , and meadow voles . lemmings  are found polyphyletic while the caucasian long-clawed vole  is among the basalmost arvicoline genera. contrary to recent taxonomic suggestions, we do not obtain support for splitting blanfordimys, lasiopodomys, neodon, and phaiomys from microtus. we concur with others  <cit>  that the higher quality of nuclear genes resides in higher values of gamma parameter, uniform and stationary base compositions, and more uniform nucleotide substitution probabilities. the usefulness of nuclear exons for investigating 2– <dig> myr old evolutionary histories is probably due to highly informative third codon positions, which keep a good compromise in their evolutionary rate: rapid enough to accumulate synapomorphies, yet slow enough to be not affected by substitutional saturation. the sequencing of nuclear dna data in an order of magnitude three to five times greater than the size of ghr exon  <dig> might resolve most nodes of the arvicolinae phylogeny provided that multiple genetically independent gene trees agree on the phylogenetic structure.
