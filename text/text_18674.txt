BACKGROUND
currently the criteria as defined by nugent et al.  <cit>  are considered as the standard procedure to score vaginal smears by gram stain  <cit> . this method scores the smears in a standardized manner by quantification of some of the cell types present – designated as lactobacillus, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides and mobiluncus 'morphotypes'. however, the nugent scoring system conflates women with potentially very different vaginal microflora in a single category  <cit> . since the method requires considerable time and skill, simpler versions have been described which assess the categories in a more qualitative manner  <cit> . recent developments in our knowledge of the vaginal microflora – including the observation of different lactobacillus species producing different amounts of hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  with a potential effect on pregnancy outcome  <cit>  urge to refine the gram stain criteria in an effort to increase the agreement between gram stain and the true composition of the vaginal microflora. in addition, a strong association of the metronidazole resistant fastidious anaerobic coccobacillus atopobium vaginae with bacterial vaginosis  <cit>  might have important implications in the pathophysiology of bacterial vaginosis related preterm labour and birth. the more accurate allocation of subjects according to vaginal microflora status, as assessed by gram stain, may enhance the validity of studies on the etiology of bacterial vaginosis, and help to better understand response to treatment and recurrence in some women, as well as its relation to preterm birth.

here we report our findings obtained by studying a total of  <dig> vaginal samples by gram stain, by dna-based techniques – like cloning and sequencing of amplified 16s rrna-genes  <cit>  and species specific pcr  <cit>  – which make it possible to detect fastidious bacteria like a. vaginae  <cit>  and by culture in combination with tdna-pcr  <cit> , which allows the rapid identification of large numbers of cultured isolates, including isolates from different lactobacillus species  <cit> . based on these findings, we propose refined criteria to categorize the status of the microflora of vaginal smears.

RESULTS
we studied the composition of the vaginal microflora of  <dig> vaginal swabs from a prospective cohort of  <dig> unselected pregnant women at three time points during pregnancy using i) gram stain based grading according to modified ison & hay criteria  <cit>  – which will be further denoted here as the criteria of claeys, ii) culture in combination with molecular identification of cultured organisms by tdna-pcr and iii) species specific pcr for g. vaginalis and a. vaginae.

detailed observation of the gram stained vaginal smears in combination with specific pcr and tdna-pcr based identification of cultured isolates led to subdivision of grade i samples and the recognition of a separate category, designated grade i-like: grade i specimens were characterized as grade ia when only lactobacillus crispatus cell types  were present , as grade ib when only other lactobacillus cell types were present  and as grade iab when both l. crispatus and other lactobacilli were present . furthermore a number of samples were designated as grade i-like because of the presence of gram positive rods, either quite small and short or otherwise irregularly shaped with clubbing, curved edges and irregular staining and often arranged like chinese letters  . to corroborate that grade i-like samples indeed represent a separate class, cloning was carried out for two samples that had been categorized as grade i-like. for completeness, figures 1i – 1j represent grade ii vaginal smears and figures 1k – 1l represent grade iii vaginal smears.

comparison between gram stain and culture
using the criteria of claeys,  <dig> vaginal smears were scored as grade ia,  <dig> as grade ib,  <dig> as grade iab,  <dig> as grade i-like,  <dig> as grade ii,  <dig> as grade iii and eight as grade iv .

we cultured  <dig> isolates anaerobically out of the  <dig> vaginal swabs and identified these with tdna-pcr. a total of  <dig> isolates remained unidentified, since no corresponding tdna-pcr fingerprint could be found in the database or because no amplification was obtained. a total of  <dig> species were identified, of which  <dig> belonged to the genus lactobacillus and six to the genus bifidobacterium . the most common species recovered from grade ia, ib and iab specimens were lactobacilli. l. crispatus  and l. jensenii  were the most abundant bacteria in grade ia samples, whereas l. gasseri  and l. iners  were the most frequently present species in grade ib specimens. grade i-like specimens were found to contain mostly bifidobacteria  and l. gasseri , while l. crispatus was almost absent . in  <dig> % of grade i-like specimens bifidobacteria were present while lactobacilli were absent. bifidobacteria were more frequent in grade i-like samples than in other samples .

l. crispatus was present in  <dig> % of grade ia,  <dig> % of grade iab and  <dig> % of grade iv samples but in less than  <dig> % in all other grades. l. crispatus was the only lactobacillus species that was linked to a single grade, namely grade ia , while the other lactobacilli were more evenly distributed over all samples . l. jensenii was the second most abundant species in grade ia , but was also frequent in most other grades, for example in  <dig> % of grade ii. l. vaginalis, the third most abundant species in grade ia  was absent from grade iii and present in less than 20% of all other grades. l. gasseri and l. iners were more abundant in grade ib , grade i-like , grade ii  and grade iii  than in grade ia .

the most characteristic cultured organisms in grade ii and grade iii specimens were g. vaginalis  , actinomyces neuii , aerococcus christensenii , a. vaginae , finegoldia magna  and varibaculum cambriense . these were virtually absent from grade i and grade iv, although g. vaginalis was present in approximately  <dig> % of grade i samples. l. jensenii  and l. gasseri  were the most common lactobacilli in grade ii specimens. furthermore, whereas l. crispatus and l. vaginalis were never cultured from grade iii specimens, l. iners  was the lactobacillus mostly present in grade iii. mobiluncus curtisii and peptostreptococcus sp. were cultured from grade iii specimens only . dialister sp.  and prevotella spp.  were frequently cultured from grade iii specimens and only sporadically from other specimens.

the average number of species cultured per sample ranged from  <dig>  for grade ia specimens to  <dig>  for grade iii specimens . overall, the species diversity of the grade i-like category was higher  than that of the grade i subcategories  and comparable to that of the grade ii category . the grade iii category had the highest species diversity  .

comparison between gram stain and species specific pcr for gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae
the series of  <dig> vaginal samples were analyzed by pcr with 16s rrna gene based primers specific for a. vaginae and 16s–3s spacer primers specific for g. vaginalis.

after amplification with the ato167f a. vaginae primer set, respectively  <dig> % of grade i,  <dig> % of grade i-like,  <dig> % of grade ii,  <dig> % of grade iii and  <dig> % of grade iv samples showed an amplicon. the percentage of positive samples for g. vaginalis specific pcr was respectively  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %.

the simultaneous presence of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis in a vaginal swab specimen had an accuracy of 90% , a sensitivity of 82% , a specificity of 90% , a positive predictive value of 26%  and a negative predictive value of 99%  in assessing bacterial vaginosis .

comparison between culture and cloning of grade i-like samples
cloning of two grade i-like samples from trimesters  <dig> and  <dig> of the same patient, revealed the presence of bifidobacterium breve , lactobacillus delbrueckii  and l. gasseri  clones. this was in agreement with the culture results which revealed the presence of b. breve in both trimesters, l. delbrueckii only in the first and l. gasseri only in the second.

in general, grade i-like samples were found by culture to contain more frequently bifidobacterium  and more different bifidobacterium species  than samples from all other categories. of the bifidobacterium species, b. breve was most clearly associated with grade i-like, grade ii and grade iii.

discussion
the importance of correct diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and of more detailed characterization of the vaginal microflora
although not causing a vaginal inflammatory response, bacterial vaginosis is considered to be the most common cause of vaginitis in pregnant and non-pregnant women and prevalences between  <dig> % and  <dig> % have been reported from european and american studies  <cit> . several studies suggest the possibility that bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of acquiring hiv  <cit>  and that the bacterial flora associated with bacterial vaginosis increases genital-tract hiv shedding  <cit> . a recent meta-analysis by leitich et al.  <cit>  established an odds ratio of  <dig> for preterm birth in association with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy. spontaneous preterm birth occurs in 7–11% of pregnancies but accounts for three quarters of perinatal morbidity and mortality and for half of long term neurological impairment in children  <cit> .

bacterial vaginosis is characterized by the replacement of the normal vaginal microflora of lactobacilli by gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic organisms. recently, different groups showed that the strict anaerobe atopobium vaginae is another organism that is strongly associated with bacterial vaginosis  <cit> . the association between a. vaginae and bacterial vaginosis might help explain why some women suffer from recurrent bacterial vaginosis. for example, a recent study pointed to great in vitro efficacy of metronidazole, since this antibiotic inhibited growth of 99% of the vaginal isolates from bacterial vaginosis samples  <cit> , but most likely overlooked the fastidious metronidazole resistant a. vaginae, shown in this study to be present in  <dig> % of bacterial vaginosis samples when detected with species specific pcr.

given the possibility that certain not yet characterized subgroups within the presumably heterogenic clinical entity of women with bacterial vaginosis could identify a group at higher risk for preterm birth than women with bacterial vaginosis as a whole and that adequate treatment of women from this higher risk group may allow for more targeted preterm birth prevention, better understanding of the composition and dynamics of the vaginal microflora and accurate diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis are warranted. also, our data indicate that refined characterization of vaginal microflora may be necessary for more accurate interpretation of the results of clinical studies. for example, thus far atopobium vaginae has been overlooked in clinical studies and furthermore, the fact that different lactobacillus species may confer different strengths of colonisation resistance  <cit>  has not been taken into account, partly because most laboratories lack the access to rapid and accurate methods for the identification of lactobacilli to the species level. in other words, several studies concerning the relation between the status of the vaginal microflora and different gynecologic and obstetric diseases and their treatments thus far may have reached biased conclusions due to insufficiently precise characterization of the microflora.

criteria for microbiological categorization of vaginal microflora status
spiegel et al.  <cit>  defined a scoring system based on some of the bacterial cell types that can be seen in gram stained smears of vaginal secretion. this was later refined by nugent et al.  <cit> , who provided a scoring system that evaluates the changes in vaginal microflora, from the normal condition to bacterial vaginosis status, as a continuum. although the nugent criteria have gained wide acceptance for the evaluation of the condition of the vaginal microflora  <cit> , further refinement is warranted for several reasons. first, no definite criteria have been described to distinguish the lactobacillus cell types from the gardnerella and bacteroides-prevotella cell types. in practice and in our experience, 'morphotypes' are often difficult to assign to one of these groups. also, some genera and species that are clearly associated with bacterial vaginosis, like peptostreptococcus spp.  <cit>  and a. vaginae  <cit>  are not included in the nugent score. furthermore, forsum et al.  <cit>  found major discrepancies in scoring when the lactobacillary cell types were few in number and larsson et al.  <cit>  reported several problems in the interpretation of smears. for example, using the nugent criteria, the presence of different lactobacillus cell types in smears from patients with bacterial vaginosis can lead to assignation to grade ii, whereas patients without bacterial vaginosis but with smears with more than 300– <dig> pleomorphic lactobacillus cells may be regarded as containing g. vaginalis, also because some of these cells are very small. additionally, the nugent scoring system conflates women with potentially very different vaginal microflora in a single category  <cit> .

in this study, the clinical microbiologist  could not grade some of the smears due to the presence of cell types not scored in the system developed by nugent  <cit>  and classified these samples as grade i-like. further detailed observation lead to the splitting up of grade i samples into subcategories designated grade ia, grade ib and grade iab. after blind grading of the vaginal smears into grades ia, ib, iab, i-like, ii, iii and iv, this classification was compared with the culture results and with species specific pcrs.

grade ia and iab: agreement with the presence of l. crispatus
from this comparison it became obvious that it is possible to recognize the presence of l. crispatus by means of gram stain, since this species was cultured in  <dig> % of the grade ia samples and  <dig> % of the grade iab samples. nevertheless, l. crispatus was not cultured from  <dig> of the  <dig> grade ia samples. this may be explained by the fact that l. crispatus is not as easily cultured as other lactobacilli. indeed, l. crispatus colonies were quite often observed as satellites of other bacteria and in some cases no growth at all was observed in samples with numerous l. crispatus-like lactobacilli on gram stain. using non culture dependent t-rflp-analysis  the ia samples negative for l. crispatus culture were tested and  <dig> were positive for l. crispatus, bringing the agreement between gram stain grading as grade ia and the presence of l. crispatus to  <dig> %. similarly, when taking into account t-rflp-analysis results, the agreement between categorization as grade iab and t-rflp-analysis positive for l. crispatus was  <dig> % whereas l. crispatus was detected by t-rflp-analysis only in  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 0% for grades ib, i-like, ii and iii, respectively. these results indicate that – for a trained microbiologist – it is possible to recognize l. crispatus bacteria upon cell morphology, a finding that is of importance since this species is clearly associated with healthy microflora, and possibly better ensures stable healthy microflora than other lactobacilli  <cit> . samples were scored as grade ib when no l. crispatus cell types were observed, but other lactobacillus cell types were predominant. the agreement with culture results was high: only  <dig> % contained l. crispatus upon culture, whereas l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were present in respectively  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the grade ib samples. these were clearly grade i samples since bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms were mostly absent.

the colonisation resistance conferred differs between lactobacillus species
overall the frequency of isolation of all lactobacillus species together was comparable for the different grades in our population, since lactobacilli were cultured from  <dig> % of grade ia,  <dig> % of grade ib,  <dig> % of grade iab,  <dig> % of grade i-like,  <dig> % of grade ii,  <dig> % of grade iii and  <dig> % of grade iv samples. this is in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . however, we observed a clear difference with regard to the lactobacillus species frequency distribution for the different grades. while l. crispatus, known as a strongly h2o2-producing species  <cit> , was cultured from  <dig> % of grade ia specimens, it was absent in grade iii specimens and only present in  <dig> % of grade i-like specimens. in contrast, l. iners, reported as a weakly h2o2-producing species  <cit> , was present in only  <dig> % of ia specimens but in  <dig> % of grade ib and  <dig> % of grade iii specimens. whether it is the hydrogen peroxide production by l. crispatus that confers colonisation resistance remains a matter of debate, since a correlation between the presence of hydrogen peroxide production and the type of vaginal microflora was found by some  <cit> , though not by others  <cit> . possibly other species specific characteristics, present in l. crispatus, but absent in species like l. gasseri and l. iners, confer colonisation resistance. it has also been hypothesized that the onset of perturbation leading to bacterial vaginosis may be due to competition between lactobacillus species  <cit> , a situation possibly reflected by grade iab specimens.

grade i-likes: a separate category of vaginal microflora status
a number of samples were initially difficult to score because the predominant cell types could not be categorized as lactobacillus, gardnerella, bacteroides-prevotella or mobiluncus cell types. these samples were considered as belonging to a separate category because of the presence of gram positive rods, either quite small and short or otherwise irregularly shaped with clubbing, curved edges and irregular staining and often arranged like chinese letters . since it is likely that most microbiologists would score this cell type as 'lactobacillus-like' and that therefore it would be scored in most cases as grade i, we designated it as 'grade i-like'. culture and species specific pcr confirmed that indeed these samples represent a separate kind of vaginal microflora. this is reflected by the increased species diversity of  <dig> , which is much higher than that for grades ia, ib and iab  and which is comparable to that of grade ii , but even more so by the virtual absence of l. crispatus  as well as of g. vaginalis and a. vaginae  and the presence of bifidobacterium spp. in  <dig> of  <dig> samples, a much higher prevalence than in samples from all other grades. this was confirmed by cloning of two grade i-like samples, which contained only l. delbrueckii, l. gasseri and b. breve.

rosenstein et al.  <cit>  mentioned a category of vaginal smears with aberrant morphology, which they designated as grade i revertants. at first sight, their category shows resemblance with the category we describe here as i-like, because of low numbers of g. vaginalis and increased numbers of bifidobacteria, but on the other hand they reported even more bifidobacteria in their grade ii and grade iii samples and they designated this category as grade i revertants because the vaginal microflora of all  <dig> women with such smears reverted to grade i, which was not the case in our study .

importantly, since gram stain based categorizing can result in the interpretation of grade i-like samples as genuine grade i samples , this class of samples may jeopardize – and probably has done so in the past – the interpretation of the results of clinical studies.

grade ii: a microbiologically intermediate stage between healthy microflora and bacterial vaginosis
our results confirm that grade ii samples represent a microbiologically clearly intermediate status between grade i and iii. l. crispatus is still present in  <dig> % of the samples , whereas the number of samples with l. gasseri  is increased compared to grade i  and grade iii . species diversity of grade ii is intermediate between that for grade i and grade iii and species typically associated with bacterial vaginosis, like a. neuii, a. christensenii, a. vaginae, b. ureolyticus, f. magna, g. vaginalis, peptoniphilus sp. and v. cambriense, are present, but again in a lower number of samples than in grade iii specimens.

grade iii: characterization of bacterial vaginosis -related organisms
the following species are generally considered as bacterial vaginosis related anaerobe organisms: anaerococcus  tetradius, a.  vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, bacteroides ureolyticus, finegoldia  magna, g. vaginalis, gemella  morbillorum, mobiluncus curtisii, mycoplasma hominis, peptoniphilus sp., peptostreptococcus sp., prevotella bivia, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella sp.  <cit> . using tdna-pcr we were able to identify  <dig> % of the cultured isolates to the species level and found our results to be largely in agreement, but in addition we cultured actinomyces neuii, aerococcus christensenii, dialister sp. and varibaculum cambriense, whereas mobiluncus spp., mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum were not or only sporadically cultured from grade ii and grade iii specimens. the absence of the latter species in our study can be explained by the fact that we did not use the specific culture methods for these fastidious organisms.

in this study we confirmed the strong association, as established previously  <cit> , between a. vaginae and bacterial vaginosis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our characterization of the vaginal microflora by means of detailed gram stain interpretation and by culture in combination with genotypic identification helps to refine our understanding of normal and disturbed vaginal microflora. we showed that l. crispatus can be recognized as such on gram stain, we established the existence of a separate additional category, characterized by the absence of l. crispatus and the abundance of bifidobacteria and we confirmed the association of atopobium vaginae with bacterial vaginosis.

these data have implications for the basic understanding of the vaginal microflora and bacterial vaginosis; in addition, they may add to the value of gram smear based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis because of better defined gram stain criteria.
