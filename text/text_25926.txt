BACKGROUND
there is increasing evidence that nucleoli play important roles in the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, telomerase production, rna processing, monitoring and response to cellular stress  <cit> . these multiple functions can be achieved by the transient localization of several hundred proteins within the nucleolar structure  <cit> . in addition, several well known nucleolar proteins seem to have multiple functions. amongst them, the abundant nucleolar proteins nucleophosmin  and nucleolin  have been the subject of numerous studies.

although nucleophosmin and nucleolin do not share any structural homology, they seem to have numerous functions in common. the predominant location of these proteins in the nucleolus strongly suggested that they could be involved in ribosome biogenesis. both proteins interact with nucleic acids  <cit> , and could be viewed as ribosome assembly factors. despite the fact that endoribonuclease and molecular chaperone activities have been reported for nucleophosmin  <cit> , its contribution to ribosome biogenesis is still unclear. the function of nucleolin in ribosome biogenesis has been well documented  <cit> . its interaction with ribosomal proteins  <cit>  and with specific pre-rrna sequences  <cit> , and its implication in the first step of pre-rrna maturation  <cit> , also suggest that nucleolin could be an important ribosome assembly factor. in addition, nucleolin seems to be involved in the control of pre-rrna accumulation  <cit> .

several observations suggest that nucleolin is also a major actor in promoting cell proliferation. nucleolin levels are higher in tumours and actively dividing cells  <cit> , and are widely used as a marker of cell proliferation. furthermore, overexpression of nucleolin cooperates with oncogenic mutant ras in a rat embryonic fibroblast transformation assay  <cit> .

nucleolin seems to be able to affect ribosomal rna gene expression in different ways. a strong link between nucleolin phosphorylation, proteolysis and the production of ribosomal rna has been observed  <cit> . the inhibition of nucleolin proteolysis leads to lower rrna transcription in an in vitro transcription system  <cit> , while the injection of nucleolin antiserum leads to 2– <dig>  fold stimulation of pre-rrna synthesis in chironomus tentans salivary glands  <cit> . injection of a 2– <dig> fold excess of nucleolin in xenopus laevis stage iv oocytes also leads to a significant reduction in the accumulation of  <dig> s pre-rna  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that nucleolin phosphorylation can be triggered by a variety of stimuli such as androgens and growth factors  <cit> , and that this phosphorylation is invariably accompanied by increased rrna transcription and cell proliferation.

in addition to nucleolar functions, nucleophosmin and nucleolin seems to share additional functions. both proteins are histone chaperones  <cit> , and appear to be involved in different aspects of dna metabolism and chromatin regulation  <cit> .

nucleophosmin is also directly implicated in cancer pathogenesis, as the npm <dig> gene is found mutated and rearranged in a number of haematological disorders  <cit> . nucleophosmin is essential for mouse embryonic development, as the inactivation of the npm <dig> gene leads to unrestricted centrosome duplication and genomic instability  <cit> . it has been proposed that during mitosis, nucleophosmin associates with duplicated centrosomes and prevents their reduplication until the g1/s phase, when it dissociates from them after phosphorylation by cdk2/e  <cit> . wang et al. further showed that the centrosomal association of nucleophosmin relies on the ran-crm <dig> complex  <cit> . although nucleolin has not previously been shown to be involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication, it is interesting to note that nucleophosmin interacts directly with nucleolin  <cit> , and that a nucleolin-like protein, together with other nucleolar proteins, has been found associated with centrosomal structure  <cit> .

to determine the function of nucleolin in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation we used sirna to knock down nucleolin expression. we found that nucleolin is not only required for cell proliferation, but that its down regulation also leads to unrestricted centrosome duplication, as described for the inactivation of nucleophosmin.

RESULTS
nucleolin is required for nucleolar structure formation
nucleolin is highly expressed in proliferating cells, and is believed to be important for cell growth. in order to study the role of nucleolin in cell proliferation, we tested different sirna for their ability to significantly decrease the amount of nucleolin in human cells. preliminary experiments with  <dig> different sirna sequences directed against distinct domains of nucleolin and  <dig> sirna controls  were performed and allowed us to select the best sirna duplexes able to induce a significant decrease of nucleolin expression. of these  <dig> sirna, two significantly reduced nucleolin protein levels . neither one of the  <dig> control sirna was able to significantly reduce the level of nucleolin protein. a mixture of sirna # <dig> and # <dig> were transfected in hela cells or in a primary culture of human fibroblast, followed by time course kinetics of nucleolin expression inhibition . in both hela cells and human primary fibroblasts, the level of nucleolin protein started to decrease  <dig> days after sirna transfection to reach a minimum after 4– <dig> days, corresponding to a decrease of about 80% . interestingly, the level of b <dig>  and fibrillarin , other abundant nucleolar proteins, was not affected by the decreased nucleolin expression. this lower level of protein expression was perfectly correlated with a decrease in nucleolin coding mrna . nucleolin mrna levels remained low for at least  <dig> days. the decrease in nucleolin protein levels was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of hela cells transfected with nucleolin sirna   compared to control cells transfected with the scrambled sirna . in addition, these microscopic observations also indicated an important morphological modification of nuclei that expressed low levels of nucleolin. these nuclei appeared bigger and more rounded with a single large nucleolar body  compared to cells transfected with the sirna control # <dig> .

since nucleolin is a major protein of the nucleolus, one might expect that depletion of nucleolin would affect nucleolar structure. as seen by electron microcopy, the nucleolus consists of three main components, designated fibrillar centers , dense fibrillar components , and granular components . ribosomal rna genes are localized in the fc, pre-rrna resides in the dfc, while late processing steps of ribosome biogenesis are found in gc. in untransfected control and in scrambled sirna transfected cells, fc is found in the center of the nucleolar structure, surrounded by the dfc. the dfc is in turn surrounded by gc, which fills out the peripheral parts of the nucleolus . nucleolin is usually found in the dfc and gc of nucleoli, ubf  in the fc, and fibrillarin in the dfc. electron microscopy analysis of control and sirna transfected cells revealed a profound modification of the different nucleolar compartments in absence of nucleolin , associated with an apparent increase of the nucleolar volume. fibrillar centers and dense fibrillar centers were observed at the periphery of the granular component, and a complete segregation of these compartments could even be observed at later time points following transfection . this reorganization of the nucleolar compartment was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of nucleolin, ubf and fibrillarin in cells transfected with a control scrambled sirna, and in nucleolin depleted cells . in interphase control cells, ubf was mainly present in foci that probably correspond to the internally localized fc, whereas nucleolin labeled nucleolar peripheric structures corresponding to dfc and gc. interestingly, in nucleolin depleted cells, ubf no longer appeared as foci, but as ring-like structures surrounding the dapi depleted regions . this staining could correspond to the delocalized fc observed by electron microscopy . in contrast, the localization of fibrillarin does not seem to be affected in nucleolin depleted hela cells . this segregation of nucleolar compartments was also found when cells were treated with low amounts of actinomycin d, an inhibitor of polymerase i transcription  <cit> . to determine if the lower expression of nucleolin led to a lower accumulation of pre-ribosomal rna, cells were collected at different times after sirna transfection, and the 45s pre-rrna analyzed by northern blot  or quantitative rt-pcr . using these two techniques, we found that nucleolin depletion leads to a 5– <dig> fold reduction of 45s accumulation, as expected  <cit> .

nucleolin has been implicated in vitro in the first processing step of pre-rrna  <cit> . it was therefore interesting to determine if down-regulation of nucleolin was able to modify the efficiency of this processing step in vivo. analysis of the efficacy of this first processing step in hela cells did not allow us to detect significant changes in the level of cleavage within the 5'ets upon nucleolin depletion . in addition, the general pattern of pre-rrna processing did not seem to be altered. the low level of remaining nucleolin might be sufficient to allow for correct processing. furthermore, since this primary processing step within the 5'ets cleavage is not complete in these cells, and it is not known how it is regulated when polymerase i transcription is inhibited, it might be difficult in this experimental system, to detect the effect of nucleolin depletion on this cleavage.

nucleolin regulates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression
to determine if nucleolin depletion affects cell proliferation, the growth rate of these cells was measured and compared to that of cells transfected with scrambled sirna and untransfected control cells. this was achieved by counting cells at different time points after transfection of sirna # <dig> and # <dig> . as soon as the level of nucleolin protein decreased , the number of cells increased more slowly and was almost steady compared to untransfected cells or to cells transfected with a scrambled sirna, suggesting that cell growth was affected by low nucleolin amount. to determine if cell growth was blocked at a specific phase of the cell cycle, flow cytometry analysis  was performed on sirna transfected and control hela cells . transfection of control sirna did not change the cell cycle profile of hela cells , whereas transfection of the mix of sirna # <dig> and # <dig> significantly altered the cell cycle . during nucleolin time-course depletion, cell cycle analysis showed a progressive and significant decrease in the cell population with a 2n dna content , whereas a progressive and significant increase was observed in the population with a 4n dna content . based on this cell cycle analysis, the number of cells in s phase was approximately unchanged . the stability of the s-phase population upon nucleolin depletion was confirmed by manually counting cells exhibiting a positive brdu staining under the microscope . similar trends were observed when cell cycle progression was analyzed on primary fibroblast cultures transfected with control sirna or with a mix of sirna # <dig> and  <dig> directed against nucleolin . sirna duplexes that have no effect on nucleolin protein levels  also have no effect on cell cycle progression , further showing that the observed cell cycle effects are the consequence of the specific depletion of nucleolin.

to determine if the absence of nucleolin was able to affect mitotic progression, we measured the effect of nucleolin depletion on the number of cells in mitosis . hela and fibroblast cells were transfected with control or anti-nucleolin sirna, and cultured for  <dig> days before fixation and staining with dapi, and immuno-detection of either phosphorylated serine  <dig> of histone h <dig> , or cyclin b <dig>  to identify mitotic cells. ph3-s <dig> labeling and dapi staining showed a significant decrease in mitotic cells . the decrease in the mitotic index upon nucleolin depletion was further confirmed by an increase in cyclin b <dig> staining of chromatin, observed concomitantly with nuclear envelope break down at the beginning of mitosis . altogether these results are indicative of a mitotic index reduction . therefore, the overall increase in the g2/m population observed by flow cytometry upon nucleolin depletion is not due to an increase in the mitotic population, but is likely to represent an increase in the g <dig> population. to confirm this hypothesis, immunofluorescence with an antibody against phosphorylated serine  <dig> of histone h <dig> , a g <dig> marker  <cit> , was performed . the data show an about 2-fold increase in cells labeled with ph3-s <dig> upon nucleolin depletion. therefore, the net gain in cells exhibiting a g <dig> marker contributes largely to the increased population exhibiting the g2/m dna content observed upon nucleolin depletion.

as a small number of cells showed polyploidy upon nucleolin depletion , we wanted to ask whether tetraploid cells with a 2n dna content contribute to the increase in the population size exhibiting a the g2/m dna content. in situ hybridization performed with a probe specific to the centromere of chromosome  <dig> on cells transfected with sirna against nucleolin revealed only very few nuclei with twice the number of hybridization signals observed in control cells . this result suggests that tetraploid cells do not significantly contribute to the observed increase in the population exhibiting a g2/m dna content observed upon nucleolin depletion. therefore the increase in g2/m population upon nucleolin depletion can be mainly explained by an increase in diploid g <dig> cells.

five days after transfection, about 20% of hela cells had a sub-2n dna content  compared to  <dig> % in untransfected control cells . consistent with that, tunnel assays  revealed about 22% of apoptotic cells  <dig> days after transfection. thus, depletion of nucleolin in hela cells triggers apoptosis. nucleolar disruption in response to cellular stress has been found to stabilize p <dig>  <cit> . indeed, we observed a marked increase in p <dig> protein levels after depletion of nucleolin . this increase may be the consequence of p <dig> protein stabilization. however, a 2-fold increase of p <dig> mrna could also be observed in both hela and fibroblast transfected cells . to determine if apoptosis was responsible for the large reduction in cell growth, observed upon nucleolin depletion  we performed a simulation to remove the contribution of cell death by apoptosis on measured growth curves . the growth curve obtained for cells transfected with control sirna was used as a starting point to calculate the estimated curve . the percentage of apoptotic cells measured during a  <dig> day time course  was subtracted from the total cell population at each time point to remove the apoptotic population from the growing cell population. the reevaluating growth curve was, as expected, below the growth curve obtained for cells transfected with control sirna, but significantly much higher than the growth curve measured for cells transfected with sirna against nucleolin . our result indicates that in addition to apoptosis induction, nucleolin depletion reduces cell proliferation. therefore, apoptosis and cell proliferation reduction both act synergistically and ultimately lead to cell growth arrest.

inhibition of nucleolin expression induces multiple nuclear alterations and centrosome amplification
observation of nucleolin depleted cells also revealed a large increase in nuclear alterations . in particular, the presence of cells with micronuclei or multiple nuclei was drastically increased in transfected cells. compared to hela cells, this increase was even more pronounced in human primary fibroblasts, which exhibit almost no micronuclei or multinuclei in the population of cells transfected with scrambled sirna. the presence of these defects could be the consequence of abnormal mitosis caused by amplified centrosomes  <cit> . to test the hypothesis that the depletion of nucleolin could lead to abnormalities in centrosome duplication, cells transfected with sirna against nucleolin or control sirna were stained with an anti-γ-tubulin antibody to detect the centrosomal structures, an anti-α-tubulin antibody to detect microtubules, a crest serum  for the centromeres, and dapi for dna. as observed on 3d reconstructions of mitotic cells , more than  <dig> signals were consistently observed for γ-tubulin in sirna transfected hela cells compared to  <dig> signals in control cells. centrosome amplification in sirna depleted mitotic cells was associated with the presence of a multipolar spindle as detected by α-tubulin staining .

discussion
many reports suggest that nucleolin plays important roles in ribosome biogenesis, ranging from rdna transcription to the assembly of the pre-ribosomal particles  <cit> , and that this multifunctional protein may have a more general role in gene regulation through its involvement in chromatin structure and dynamics  <cit> . nucleolin is highly expressed in tumors and actively dividing cells  <cit> , and is often used as a marker for cell proliferation. its ability to cooperate with ras in a rat embryonic transformation assay  <cit> , to repress translation of p <dig> mrna  <cit> , and to act as the target of the anti-proliferative gros   <cit> , suggests that nucleolin could directly affect cell proliferation independently of its action in ribosome biogenesis.

to explore the role of nucleolin in cell proliferation, we used sirna to repress the expression of nucleolin protein in hela cells and in cultured human primary fibroblasts. as soon as a significant decrease in the levels of nucleolin protein could be observed , cells stopped proliferating , and a significant number of cells entered apoptosis . the slower growth of cells depleted in nucleolin is probably not the consequence of widespread alteration in gene expression. we performed protein labelling experiments in nucleolin depleted cells and did not observed major alterations in protein synthesis in these cells . in addition, we have performed transcriptome analysis of hela and human fibroblast cells depleted in nucleolin. surprisingly, only a limited number of genes  seem significantly affected , suggesting that the slow growth of nucleolin depleted cells is not the result of a global effect of nucleolin on gene expression. instead, changes in the expression of specific genes, such as p <dig>  might be responsible for slow growth and apoptosis. future experiments will explore the different pathways that are activated upon nucleolin depletion.

one of the most drastic modifications of the ultra structure of the cell was the rearrangement of the nucleolar compartment . fibrillar centers and dense fibrillar centers were delocalized to the periphery of the granular component, and a complete segregation of these compartments was also observed at later time points after sirna transfection. this nucleolar reorganization had some resemblance to that obtained after the inhibition of rdna transcription with low amount of actinomycin d  <cit> , with injection of anti-ubf antibodies  <cit> , or tif-ia inactivation  <cit> . indeed, we also observed that in nucleolin depleted cells, rdna transcription was lower than in control cells . however, unlike these earlier studies, we failed to observe a release of the major nucleolar proteins fibrillarin, ubf  or b <dig>  in the nucleoplasm. instead, ubf remained associated with the reorganized fibrillar component in interphase cells.

as previously described  <cit>  this nucleolar disruption is accompanied by elevated levels of p <dig> protein . the increase in p <dig> levels was likely the consequence of the increased translation of p <dig> mrna  <cit>  and/or stabilization of p <dig> mrna . as we have not directly tested if the interaction of hdm <dig>  with p <dig> was altered in nucleolin deficient cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that the elevated level of p <dig> was also due to inhibition of hdm <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> .

one of the most remarkable consequences of nucleolin inactivation is the apparent blockage of cells in the g <dig> phase , and the significant increase in multinuclear cells and cells with micronuclei . by contrast, the number of cells in mitosis was drastically reduced in nucleolin depleted cells . furthermore, in situ hybridization with a probe specific to the pericentromeres of chromosome  <dig> did not detect any significant increase in tetraploid cells, suggesting that cells are probably arrested in g <dig>  this phenotype is quite different from that obtained upon inactivation of tif-ia  <cit> , but similar to that obtained upon inactivation of b <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, as with the inactivation of b <dig>  we also observed an alteration in the control of centrosome number in cells expressing low levels of nucleolin . interestingly, it was also recently reported that nucleolin was required for chromosome congression and the maintenance of mitotic spindle integrity  <cit> , suggesting that nucleolin may have a more general role during mitosis.

it is also striking that nucleolin and b <dig> share numerous homologous functions, despite the fact that they have different structures. both interact with nucleic acids  <cit> , shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> , and are involved in different aspects of ribosome biogenesis  <cit>  and in chromatin regulation  <cit> . this report highlights other possible common properties of nucleolin and b <dig> in cell proliferation control and centrosome duplication.

it has been proposed that during mitosis, when the nuclear envelope breaks down, some b <dig> is delocalized from the nucleolus to centrosomes where it remains bound until it is phosphorylated by cdk2/cyclin e at mid-late g <dig>  <cit> . some b <dig> phosphorylated on thr <dig> remained at the centrosome and seemed to be important for the interaction of the rock ii kinase that also regulated centrosome duplication  <cit> . the regulated localization of b <dig> at the centrosomes could represent one of the licensing systems for centrosome duplication ensuring only one duplication per cell cycle  <cit> . although nucleolin has been found associated with centrosomal structures in the proteomic analysis of human centrosomes  <cit> , we have not been able to detect nucleolin in these structures by immunofluorescence using different antibodies. however, localization of b <dig> protein at the centrosomes is not easily detectable. only a few b <dig> antibodies were able to detect b <dig> protein at the centrosomal structure  <cit> , while conflicting data were obtained with gfp-b <dig>  <cit> . this may reflect an inaccessibility of the antibody to the protein, post-translational modifications or an alteration of the b <dig> structure when it was present at the centrosomes. interestingly, nucleolin interacts with b <dig>  <cit> , and several nucleolar proteins have been found associated with centrosomal structures in the proteomic characterization of the human centrosome  <cit> . this could suggest that a nucleolar protein complex could participate in the regulation of centrosome duplication. future experiments should further explore this link between nucleolin and the regulation of centrosome duplication.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we uncovered a new role for nucleolin in cell proliferation and cell division. unexpectedly we found that expression of nucleolin was required for a correct mitosis and controlled centrosome duplication. we expect that these findings will be useful to better understand not only the complex function of nucleolin in the cell but also the function of the nucleolar structure in other processes that ribosome biogenesis.
