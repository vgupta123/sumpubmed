BACKGROUND
copy number variation is an important component of genetic diversity in both caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  and humans  <cit>  and has been associated with complex traits including autism spectrum disorder  <cit> , mental retardation  <cit> , and schizophrenia  <cit> . genes involved in sensory perception, innate immunity and cell adhesion are overrepresented in copy number variants   <cit> .

we have previously described extensive copy number variation relative to the bristol n <dig> strain  <cit>  in the genomes of two highly divergent isolates of c. elegans, cb <dig>  and ju <dig>   <cit> . these observations were a by-product of our application of array comparative genomic hybridization  to discover deletions in mutants of this nematode species. as our laboratory is part of the c. elegans gene knockout consortium we are interested in methods that can help us identify gene deletions more efficiently. our previous results for cb <dig> and ju <dig> were encouraging, so we examined additional natural isolates to measure the extent of copy number variation in the genomes of less divergent strains. it is important to realize that the c. elegans gene knockout consortium can deprioritize genes affected by deletions in natural isolates in our attempt to generate novel deletions in all genes. as many of the deletions we identify in this study are members of multigene families  the knockout consortium can focus on obtaining deletions in members of these families that do not vary among wild type strains.

we also recognized that a large number of indel loci spread throughout the genome might allow us to more thoroughly characterize the relationships among strains, which have been difficult to ascertain due to the limited number of markers used in previous studies. although c. elegans reproduces primarily through selfing of hermaphrodites, males allow rare outcrossing in the wild at an estimated rate of 1-2%  <cit> . the frequency of outcrossing varies among populations and has been estimated between  <dig> % based on linkage disequilibrium measurements  <cit>  to as high as 20% based on heterozygote frequencies  <cit> . previous studies utilizing nuclear markers have identified some recombinant strains, but have been limited in their ability to precisely identify which regions of the genome have been exchanged due to the relatively small number of loci at hand  <cit> . more recently, snp genotyping identified  <dig> haplotypes among  <dig> wild isolates  <cit> , indicating that recombination has occurred more frequently than previously appreciated  <cit> .

in this study we have used acgh to detect copy number variation in  <dig> natural isolates of c. elegans in addition to the  <dig> isolates from our previous work  <cit> . we have chosen to use the term indel to refer to the deletions and duplications that we have detected, since many of them are <  <dig> kb in length and are thus not considered cnvs by some  <cit> . we use the term cnv only for larger aberrations. we use "deletion" to refer to a sequence absent in a natural isolate but present in n <dig>  and "amplification" to refer to an increase in copy number relative to n <dig>  an "amplification" detected in a natural isolate might alternatively represent the deletion of a duplicate copy in the n <dig> lineage. only genes that are present in a single copy in the n <dig> genome are represented on our microarrays, therefore the presence of a gene  cannot be reconstituted in an isolate by mutation or conversion from an ancestor carrying a deletion allele. nevertheless, it is possible for a gene to reappear in a lineage as the result of outcrossing, recombining the intact gene into the lineage. also, it is possible that extreme sequence divergence could be misinterpreted as a deletion in some cases .

we discovered  <dig> different deletions among  <dig> natural isolates, affecting over 5% of the genes in the canonical n <dig> genome. we found that recombination due to outcrossing in the natural history of the species has caused different portions of the genome to possess different genealogies, such that the relationships among strains are not well represented by a traditional bifurcating phylogenetic tree.

RESULTS
acgh reveals a bias favoring coding sequence deletions over coding sequence amplifications in c. elegans
we performed  <dig> new acgh experiments utilizing our exon-centric whole genome microarray  <cit> , which includes probes to 94% of the exons and 98% of the genes in the n <dig> reference genome. each acgh experiment compared a different natural isolate to n <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the number and lengths of indels that were detected in each strain, including cb <dig> and ju <dig> from our previous study  <cit> , as well as the number of genes and pseudogenes that were deleted in each strain. it is important to note that nearly all of the indels detected in this study affect coding sequences. one "amplification" initially detected in all of the strains was subsequently identified by pcr and dna sequencing as a 1788-bp deletion in our n <dig> strain , affecting exons  <dig> and  <dig> of alh- <dig>  so that false amplification was ignored in all strains.

a the number of deleted genes and pseudogenes includes those either wholly or partially deleted. b the overall number of deletions and amplifications is the sum of those found in all strains, so indels found in more than one strain were counted multiple times. c the overall number of deleted genes and pseudogenes is the number deleted in at least one of the  <dig> strains .

we detected  <dig> deletions  and  <dig> amplifications in the twelve natural isolates. indel alleles were considered the same if they overlapped and both the leftmost and rightmost affected probes were within  <dig> probes of each other . amplifications were less robustly detected than deletions due in part to the conservative criteria that we used , but this alone does not account for the large preponderance of deletions in the strains. for example, relaxing the log <dig> fluorescence ratio of mutant:wild-type  cutoff for amplifications from  <dig>  to  <dig>  or even  <dig>  captured only a modest number of additional amplifications and did not affect the strong bias towards deletions in the strains . the bias towards deletions is clearly evident in plots of log <dig> ratios on each chromosome .

indel lengths
an anova indicated that indel length varied significantly among the strains in our study , but not if rw <dig> was excluded from the analysis . with just  <dig> deletions and  <dig> amplifications, the mean length of indels in rw <dig>  is greater than in the other strains, due largely to an 86-kb deletion on chromosome iv and a 117-kb duplication on chromosome v. to our knowledge, rw <dig> is the only strain in our study with a high tc <dig> transposon count  <cit> , so transposon activity may have been more important in generating cnvs in this strain than in the others. the median indel length among all strains was  <dig>  kb, with a mean of  <dig> bp. our ability to detect very small aberrations was restrained by the probe density on the arrays . indel length also varied significantly among chromosomes , with larger indels on chromosomes v, iv and ii. the mean size of indels on each chromosome ranged from  <dig>  kb on chromosome v to just  <dig> kb on chromosome x. furthermore, a welch's two-sample t-test revealed a significant difference  between the mean indel lengths on the autosome arms  versus the autosome centers or the x chromosome . this difference is not simply due to the small difference in the density of probes targeting the arms and the centers .

pcr validation of indel candidates
we performed pcr and gel electrophoresis to estimate the false positive and false negative rates of our acgh indel predictions . pcr primers were made to amplify  <dig> deletion loci and  <dig> amplification loci with predicted indel lengths between  <dig> -  <dig> bp. this size range includes 40% of the indels that we predicted, and only 9% of predicted indels were smaller than  <dig> bp. most indels detected in this study were larger than  <dig> bp and are thus likely to have lower false positive and false negative rates than the loci that were tested. among  <dig> deletion candidates tested at the  <dig> deletion loci, we observed  <dig> failed pcr reactions,  <dig> confirmed deletions and  <dig> apparent false positive , yielding a false positive rate of only 1% among the successful pcrs . for each deletion locus we also tested one isolate in which acgh did not detect a deletion, and observed  <dig> failed pcr reactions,  <dig> confirmed negatives and  <dig> false negatives, giving a false positive rate of 9%, although it is possible that some of these false negatives affect non-coding sequences that are not probed by our microarrays and were thus undetectable by cgh.  <dig> of the  <dig> amplification candidates that we tested gave wild-type pcr fragments, suggesting that tandem copies of the amplified sequences are not found between the primer sequences that we used, perhaps because the additional copies exist elsewhere in the genome or because the amplifications extended beyond the primer sequences such that wild-type pcr products are still produced despite the amplifications. interestingly, pcr indicated a deletion at a high-confidence amplification locus  in cb <dig>  suggesting that copies of the amplified sequence are found elsewhere in the genome and not between the pcr primer sites as in n <dig> 

extensive copy number variation in the c. elegans genome allows even very closely related strains to be distinguished by acgh
a single deletion was detected in cb <dig> and subsequently confirmed by pcr and dna sequencing. the deletion completely encompasses math- <dig> . this illustrates the power of acgh experiments to distinguish among strains, since cb <dig> had previously appeared identical to n <dig> based on nearly complete mtdna sequencing  <cit>  and multilocus microsatellite genotyping  <cit> . still, with only one deletion, cb <dig> appears as similar to the canonical n <dig> genome as our laboratory n <dig> strain , at least in terms of the coding sequences targeted by our probes. this suggests the possibility that cb <dig> is a laboratory contaminant or escapee . in effect, the acgh experiment comparing cb <dig> to n <dig> served as a self-versus-self negative control and demonstrated that our whole genome array design, in itself, does not produce false positives.

cb <dig> and ju <dig> were the most divergent strains relative to n <dig>  with more indels and more genes deleted than any of the other strains. kr <dig> was the most divergent among the other strains and had more deletions on chromosome ii than any other strain, including cb <dig> and ju <dig>  but curiously had no deletions at all on the left half of chromosome v  where  <dig> deletions were present in cb <dig> and  <dig> in ju <dig>  the absence of deletions on v-l suggests the possibility that kr <dig> reacquired an n2-like v-l through recombination. interestingly, rw <dig> was the least divergent strain other than the n2-like cb <dig>  this result contrasts with an earlier study stating that rw <dig> appeared to be more divergent than  <dig> of our strains based on the number of alleles in  <dig> chemoreceptor genes  <cit> .

the distribution of indels in the genome and the overrepresentation of indels in particular gene families
additional file 3: table s <dig> lists all of the genes affected by the indels we detected.  <dig> different genes were either wholly or partially deleted in at least one strain. the same gene families that we found to be overrepresented in indels in cb <dig> and ju <dig> are also clearly overrepresented amongst indels in the new strains in this study, most notably the math-btb, f-box, lectin and serpentine chemoreceptor gene families. all of these gene families cluster on the autosome arms  <cit> .

relatedness inferences based on deletions shared by multiple natural isolates
many of the indels we detected were found in multiple strains . figure  <dig> shows the number of deletions found in each strain, and the number of other strains that carry the same deletions. the strains with the most deletions also have the highest proportion of unique deletions in our data set, excluding cb <dig> and rw <dig>  which carry only unique deletions. by this measure, cb <dig> was the most divergent strain, with 66%  of its deletions being unique among the  <dig> strains. this agrees closely with a study reporting that 70% of cb <dig> snps were not present in nine other natural isolates  <cit> . unique deletions comprise 64%  of the deletions in ju <dig>  42%  of the deletions in my <dig>  and 39%  of the deletions in kr <dig>  in addition to carrying the most indels relative to n <dig> among the strains in our study, cb <dig>  ju <dig>  my <dig> and kr <dig> are also the least n2-like according to snp genotypes  <cit> .

a the number listed for all comparisons between a strain and itself is simply the total number of deletions detected in that strain.

different relationships are predicted by different regions of the genome due to the presence of recombination in the lineage, and this is reflected in the low bootstrap confidence at many of the nodes on the consensus tree. an example of a possible recombination event is indicated in figure  <dig>  ab <dig> was previously identified as a recombinant strain based on discrepancies between the phylogenies inferred by mitochondrial and nuclear marker data sets  <cit> , and the bootstrap support at the node leading to the ab <dig> on our consensus tree is particularly low. while ju <dig> was most similar to ju <dig> on i-r, it shared more deletions with kr <dig> on ii-l, iii-l and v-r. ju <dig> and kr <dig> were identified as each other's closest relative on 27% of cs  trees inferred from all bootstrap replicates, and the group of ju258/kr314/ju <dig> was also fairly common . kr <dig> was more similar to cb <dig> and cb <dig> on chromosome ii. other groups with appreciable bootstrap support but not appearing on the consensus tree included ab1/cb <dig> , cb4853/cb4858/cb4854/ju <dig> , my2/ju <dig>  and my2/ju258/ju <dig> .

discussion
a bias favoring deletions affecting gene families involved in environmental responses and innate immunity
genes thought to be involved in sensory perception and innate immunity are enriched in indels in both c. elegans  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . these gene families include the c. elegans f-box and serpentine receptor chemoreceptor families, as well as genes involved in ubiquitination and secreted proteins possibly involved in innate immunity  <cit> . chemoreceptor gene families have undergone significant expansion in c. elegans since its common ancestor with caenorhabditis briggsae  <cit> , including multiple rounds of tandem duplication in the sra and srab families  <cit> , and appear prone to gene gains and losses. we found that indel lengths were larger on the autosome arms where homologous gene clusters of these same gene families are the most common  <cit> . higher recombination rates  <cit>  and the presence of homologous gene clusters probably predisposes autosome arms to non-allelic homologous recombination  events, which tend to generate larger cnvs, whereas smaller indels are more likely created by non-homology based mechanisms  <cit> . conversely, the increased frequency of snps in the autosome arms of natural isolates is probably not due to the increased rate of recombination, but rather to increased genetic hitchhiking and/or background selection in the autosome centers  <cit> .

we chose to include pseudogenes in additional file 3: table s <dig> because many genes annotated as pseudogenes in the n <dig> strain probably have functional copies in other natural isolates, especially genes with a single defect in n <dig> . the large number of deleted genes we detected suggests that n <dig> itself carries deletion alleles for many genes that are present in other natural isolates. these events remain undetected since only probes to n <dig> sequences are included on our microarrays.

a bias favoring deletions over insertions has previously been observed in patterns of pseudogene variation in c. elegans  <cit> . it has also been suggested that there may be a high rate of spontaneous deletion in the c. elegans genome  <cit> , and perhaps even selection for small genome size  <cit> . we detected far more coding sequence deletions than amplifications in all of the natural isolates. this is the opposite of what is found in drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and humans  <cit> , and may at first seem puzzling since selection should tend to favor coding sequence amplifications over deletions. non-allelic homologous recombination  is one mechanism for creating copy number variation and it generates a mutational bias favoring deletions  <cit> . it is possible that the c. elegans mating system, consisting mainly of selfing, coupled with recurring population bottlenecks due to a demography including frequent extinction and recolonization events  <cit>  producing founder effects, reduces the effective population size  of c. elegans to a point where selection against deletions cannot overcome stochastic events and the force of genetic drift, which in turn leads to the fixation of more deletions than amplifications as a result of the mutational bias of nahr. the worldwide ne of c. elegans has been estimated between  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> , which is orders of magnitude less than the ne of drosophila  <cit>  and possibly also less than the current human ne  and the historic human ne of not more than perhaps  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . it is also possible that loss of gene function could be adaptive in some cases  <cit> , such as for certain chemoreceptors in specific environments.

new insights into complex strain relationships resulting from recombination and outcrossing in the c. elegans lineage
different portions of the genome will possess different genealogies due to recombination. trees are therefore inherently flawed in their generalized depiction of strain relationships when recombination has occurred between lineages, and should not be interpreted as phylogenies. nevertheless, our results largely agree with other trees inferred from nuclear markers  <cit> . strains that are close together on these trees generally share more deletions than do strains that are further apart, with a few bu but notable exceptions probably resulting from the limited number of loci available in earlier studies. for example, our results differ from the haber et al. study  <cit>  in which cb <dig> and cb <dig> appeared most closely related to one another, identical at 10/ <dig> microsatellite loci. we found that cb <dig> was much more closely related to cb <dig>  sharing 52/ <dig> of its deletions with cb <dig>  but sharing just 21/ <dig> deletions with cb <dig>  cb <dig> and cb <dig> appeared identical on ii-l and throughout chromosomes iii and v . only  <dig> cb <dig> deletions not found in cb <dig> were present in any other strains, including  <dig> deletions on the x chromosome that were found in my <dig>  and  <dig> deletions on ii-r that were present in cb <dig>  four of the  <dig> deletions found in cb <dig>  but not in cb <dig>  were present in ju <dig> . cb <dig> and cb <dig> did share deletions in the regions of some of the haber et al. microsatellites but not in all cases. for instance, cb <dig> shared a deletion with cb <dig> and cb <dig>  that is not found in cb <dig>  which is just  <dig> kb away from the microsatellite allele shared by cb <dig> and cb <dig> on ii-l. this highlights the importance of using a large number of loci spread throughout the genome when estimating strain relatedness.

another discrepancy between the relationships inferred in our study and those estimated by haber et al.  <cit>  involves ju <dig>  microsatellites did not reveal close relatedness between ju <dig> and ju <dig>  but ju <dig> shared more deletions with ju <dig>  than with any other strain in our study. results of snp studies also suggest a closer relationship between these two strains  <cit> . ju <dig> was most similar to kr <dig> and cb <dig> on v-r, and shared 26/ <dig> deletions with kr <dig> overall. although it does not appear on the consensus tree, a ju263/ju258/kr <dig> group appeared on 28% of w trees inferred from all bootstrap replicates. chromosome iii told yet another story, where ju <dig> shared 4/ <dig> deletions on iii-l with ju <dig>  and none of these with any other strain.

overall, cb <dig> did not appear particularly closely related to any of the other strains. cb <dig> shared the most deletions with kr <dig>  ju <dig>  ju <dig>  ju <dig> and my <dig> , and slightly fewer with the remaining strains . however, specific regions of the cb <dig> genome more closely resembled particular strains. for example, cb <dig> and ju <dig> shared  <dig> deletions in common over a  <dig>  mb interval on chromosome v, but each shared only one deletion over the same interval with any other strain . cb <dig>  ju <dig>  also share many cb <dig> snp alleles in this portion of the genome  <cit> . still, cb <dig> and ju <dig> were significantly diverged from one another in this region, which included  <dig> deletions unique to cb <dig> and  <dig> deletions unique to ju <dig>  many other regions of similarity among different groups of strains are evident in additional file 2: figure s <dig> and additional file 3: table s <dig>  illustrating that the relationships among strains are complicated due to recombination and outcrossing, probably to a greater extent than previously appreciated in studies utilizing fewer genetic markers  <cit> . our study sheds further light on the extent of recombination in the natural history of the species because unlike the study by rockman et al.  <cit> , our study includes a great number of alleles not found in cb <dig> .

very common indels, mutation hotspots, and the possibility of extreme sequence divergence masquerading as deletions
remarkably, we found  <dig> -kb deletions  and duplications  that affected exactly the same  <dig> probes on chromosome iii. these indels target the retrotransposon retr- <dig>  the log <dig> ratios for these amplifications  indicated a roughly four-fold amplification, suggesting the presence of multiple copies of the retrotransposon.

some deletions and amplifications were more common among the strains in our study than the allele observed in n <dig> . for example, a 10-kb deletion on chromosome iii was found in all strains except cb <dig> and rw <dig>  this deletion affected  <dig> uncharacterized genes, y75b8a. <dig>  y75b8a. <dig> and y75b8a. <dig>  and could possibly be of ancient origin. it is possible that some common indels have arisen by independent mutations, particularly if there are hotspots susceptible to mutation by nahr  <cit>  and/or subject to positive selection. however another study has shown that all of the strains in our study except cb <dig> and rw <dig> also share hawaiian snp alleles in precisely this region of chromosome iii , suggesting that the common deletion we detected is shared by descent. we also found several very common deletions on v-r , which is a region rich in copy number variation.

regions with very high sequence divergence could potentially produce log <dig> ratios negative enough to appear as deletions in acgh data, but are unlikely to account for a sizeable proportion of the deletions that we detected. the false positive rate in our pcr validation of small deletion candidates was only 1%. on average, roughly 10% or more of the nucleotides in each of several adjacent 50-mer probes would need to be mutated in order to approach our log <dig> ratio cutoff for deletions  <cit> . this level of sequence variability in our probe sequences is particularly unlikely because our probes target coding sequences. on average, single nucleotide polymorphisms relative to n <dig> exist at 1/ <dig> nucleotides in cb <dig>  <cit>  and 1/ <dig> nucleotides in cb <dig>  <cit> , but recent whole genome sequencing of the cb <dig> genome has identified several regions of much higher sequence diversity  that sometimes coincide with deletions identified in our acgh data . nevertheless, one cb <dig> deletion that we detected and an overlapping region of high sequence diversity have both been independently identified and confirmed, and are associated with the genetic incompatibility between cb <dig> and n <dig>  <cit> . reproductive isolation has allowed for the accumulation of sequence diversity in this region. still, we cannot rule out that some of the deletions we report could be false positives resulting from regions of extreme sequence divergence. this is probably more likely in the most divergent strains. genes in some of the gene families that are overrepresented amongst the deletions we report are known to be subject to positive selection for changes in amino acid sequence  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that there is substantial copy number variation in coding sequences in the c. elegans genome. indels are most common on the autosome arms, especially on chromosomes ii and v. deletions relative to n <dig> are much more common than amplifications. over 5% of the annotated genes in the n <dig> genome overlap with indels in at least one of the  <dig> strains that we examined. this underestimates the copy number variation in the c. elegans genome because we examined only  <dig> natural isolates, our ability to detect very small indels is limited by the probe density on our microarrays, and we did not attempt to detect indels that do not affect exons. approximately 26% of the c. elegans genome is intronic and 47% is intergenic sequence  <cit> . the indels that were detected should be useful in explaining natural phenotypic variation, particularly in chemosensation  <cit>  and innate immunity  <cit> . acgh is a powerful method to quickly obtain a large number of genetic markers throughout the genome, and has revealed complex relationships among wild c. elegans isolates resulting from recombination and outcrossing events throughout the natural history of the species. the naturally occurring deletions we have detected contribute significantly to the number of deletion alleles available to the c. elegans research community, and genes affected by these deletions can be deprioritized in efforts to generate novel mutations.
