BACKGROUND
aquaporins are protein channels, which are assembled as tetramers in biological membranes to facilitate the rapid, yet selective conductance of water and other small solutes and gasses down their concentration gradients  <cit> . each protomer is comprised of a conserved tertiary structure consisting of  <dig> transmembrane domains with two hemihelices that typically project opposing asn-pro-ala  motifs as part of a central proton-excluding selectivity filter  <cit> . in some channels, the npa motifs may be modified for other functions  <cit> . an additional selectivity filter located in the outer channel vestibule typically consists of aromatic amino acids and an arg residue , which determines the molecular substrate specificity of the pore  <cit> . previous research has shown that aquaporins are encoded in the genomes of nearly all organisms studied to date, with diverse subfamilies expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . although high gene copy numbers are found in plants and deuterostome animals, the superfamily has been categorised into four major grades consisting of classical water-selective type aquaporins , aqp8-type aquaamoniaporins , aquaglyceroporins  and unorthodox aquaporins  .

recent research in the biomedical field has begun to focus on the roles of aquaporin water channels in drug-resistant parasites as potential therapeutic targets  <cit> . this includes aquaporins expressed in protozoan parasites causing malaria, toxoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, and metazoan parasites causing fascioliasis and schistosomiasis in mammals . experiments have shown that double allelic disruption of the major glycerol-transporting channel  in mouse erythrocytes inhibits the virulence of the malaria causing plasmodium species of parasite by attenuating its growth and lipogenesis  <cit> . other studies have investigated aquaporins in the hexapod mosquitoes  and arachnid ticks  that act as vectors for such parasites or other bacterial and viral pathogens . unlike the protozoan parasites, which infect endogenous tissues, however, mosquitoes and ticks are ectoparasites, which gorge on the blood of mammals as part of their reproductive cycle  <cit> . this hematophagous behaviour induces osmoregulatory stress due to the manifold quantities of fluid imbibed  <cit> , and a number of aquaporins have been identified that are considered to be involved in the fluid homeostasis of ingestion, excretion and chemoreception. for dipteran mosquitoes, chironomids and tsetse flies, this includes up to six aquaporins variously labelled as aeaaqp or aqp <dig> to − <dig> , which may be confused with the mammalian aquaporins  encompassing both water-selective channels and glps. for other insects, an alternative nomenclature has been partially applied  <cit> , based upon their phylogeny and function, including water-selective channels similar to the drosophila intrinsic protein  , a water and urea-transporting channel similar to pyrocoelia rufa integral protein   <cit> , and a cell-adhesive, cation-permeating neurogenic protein termed big brain   <cit> . the aquaporin nomenclature for ticks is also confusingly annotated as aqp <dig> or − <dig>  <cit> , which are glps rather than the water-selective channels found in mammalian genomes. as for the mouse aqp <dig> trial, it is one of the tick glps that has been targeted for vaccine development. in this instance, recombinant regions of the glp  were intramuscularly injected into cattle, and provided sufficient antigenic capacity to reduce tick infection by up to 75 %  <cit> .

an equally problematic blood-feeding ectoparasite with broad resistance to available drugs is the saltwater salmon louse , which is a caligid crustacean copepod  causing severe infections of salmonids across the atlantic and pacific regions  <cit> . it has been established that in contrast to its salmonid host, which is an osmoregulator, the ionic concentration of the louse’s hemolymph conforms to full strength seawater and remains significantly hyperosmotic in dilute seawater, however, cell volume regulation breaks down in fresh and brackish waters  <cit> . these features suggest that aquaporins likely play important physiological roles in the louse’s fluid homeostasis, which, given the divergent osmoregulatory capabilities to its salmonid host, could represent eminent therapeutic targets. to date, however, almost nothing is known of the genomic diversity of these channels in crustaceans, which are represented by tens of thousands of species  <cit> . to redress this lack of knowledge we screened the available genome of the salmon louse, and identified the full complement of water channel genes and cloned the corresponding cdnas. we then used maximum likelihood and bayesian inference of the louse nucleotides and deduced proteins to classify the genomic repertoires of aquaporins in the four extant lineages of arthropoda, the chelicerata , myriapoda , crustacea  and hexapoda . we subsequently functionally characterised the permeability properties and stage specific-expression patterns of each channel, and used the integrated results to propose a uniform aquaporin nomenclature for arthropods and vertebrates.

RESULTS
the aquaporin superfamily of the salmon louse
the screening of the salmon louse genome identified nine putative sequences with homologies to the aquaporin family of proteins. each putative mrna sequence was isolated and cloned using gene-specific primers and rapid amplification of cdna ends  analyses. this resulted in  <dig> cdnas with open reading frames ranging in length from 777– <dig> bp, encoding proteins of 258– <dig> amino acids, which, following phylogenetic analyses , we termed bib, prip-like , glp1- <dig>  aqp12-like <dig>  and aqp12-like  <dig>  . we found no evidence for the existence of a putative lsal-evj-541- <dig> aqp  deposited in genbank, either experimentally using pcr with gene specific primers or in silico via searches of the salmon louse genome.fig.  <dig> molecular structures of salmon lice aquaporins. a multiple sequence alignment of the full-length proteins showing secondary structural features including the n-terminal regions , α-helices , transmembrane domains , loops a-e and c-termini . unique  and common  putative phosphorylation sites are shown for the n- and c-teminal regions. the two asn-pro-ala  motifs are highlighted in green and yellow on hemihelices  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. aromatic-arginine  residues associated with the selectivity filter in the outer channel vestibule are highlighted in magenta, organge, red and blue, respectively. the position of ser <dig>  which normally corresponds to the ar/r residue on h <dig> is highlighted in gray for bib. residues predicted to confer glycerol selectivity  are highlighted in gray  <cit> . b, c and d extracelluar views of cartoon renders of bib, pripl and glp1_v <dig> with ar/r residues  coloured according to highlighted residues in . helices and extracellular loops are annotated



alignment and in silico analyses of the secondary and tertiary structures showed that each louse protein consists of six transmembrane domains, two asn-pro-ala -like motifs at the termini of two hemihelices, and five loops a – e typically found in mammalian aquaporins  <cit> . the largest protein, which has a deduced length of  <dig> amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of  <dig> kd is bib, and harbours a long n-terminus  and an exceptionally long c-terminus , similar to the subdomain structure of the drosphila bib molecule  <cit> . the n-terminus of the louse bib is thus equivalent in length to the membrane-spanning domains , while the c-terminus is twice the size. three dimensional reconstruction of the louse bib revealed that in contrast to the majority of aquaporins displaying an ar/r residue on transmembrane domain  <dig> , the putative constriction residue is phe <dig> on tmd <dig>  rather than ser <dig> on tmd <dig> . conversely, pripl, which represents the smallest aquaporin in the louse superfamily with  <dig> amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kd, displays the more canonical ar/r constriction and functional  residues associated with the water-selective branch of aquaporins   <cit> . the tertiary structures of the glps, which range in length from 266– <dig> amino acids with predicted molecular masses from  <dig> – <dig>  kd, appear less constricted in the central pore due to a generally more relaxed fold conformation and an uncharged thr on tmd <dig> of glp1_v <dig> and −1_v <dig> . interestingly, although glp <dig>  −3_v <dig> and −3_v <dig> harbour a his on tmd <dig> that is typical of water-selective channels  <cit> , the in silico models indicate that the tmd <dig> his does not strongly protrude into the central channel as in pripl and thus may not present a hindrance to glycerol conductance . the remaining sequences, aqp12l <dig> and -12l <dig>  were more divergent  with lengths of 262– <dig> amino acids and predicted molecular masses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd, respectively. these latter channels have an ungapped alignment identity of  <dig>  % and encode non-canonical cpy and npv motifs associated with unorthodox members of the aquaporin superfamily  <cit> . three-dimensional models based upon the structure mask of aqpz  indicate that aqp12l <dig> is highly constricted due to a phe on tmd <dig>  while aqp12l <dig> has a more open conformation due to the substitution of the phe for an ile in this position .

molecular phylogeny of salmon louse aquaporins uncovers the genomic repertoires in arthropoda
to understand the evolutionary history of the salmon louse aquaporins, each paralog was subjected to phylogenetic analyses in relation to  <dig> orthologs retrieved from chelicerata, myriapoda, crustacea and hexapoda using maximum likelihood and bayesian protocols. in addition,  <dig> prokaryotic aqpz, glpf and aqpm orthologs were included to ensure that none of the isolated louse aquaporins were derived from prokaryotic endosymbionts. two main arthropod data sets were constructed consisting of  <dig> non-redundant orthodox aquaporins  and  <dig> non-redundant unorthodox aquaporins . these analyses revealed that two of the louse paralogs, bib and pripl are members of the classical water-selective branch of aquaporins as judged by their derivative clustering above bacterial aqpz. although the salmon louse bib clustered as an arthropod bib, it did not cluster together with the other malacostracan  or branchiopod  crustaceans. this is primarily due to the derived nature of the louse sequence, which has a membrane-spanning identity of 27–28 % compared to the  <dig> other arthropod bibs analysed. in contrast the water flea  bib is less derived with 32–38 % identity to the membrane-spanning regions of other arthropod bib-like proteins, and clusters as a sister branch to hexapoda consistent with the pancrustacean model of arthropod evolution  <cit> . the present phylogenetic data thus reveal that neurogenic bib channels are not only found in dipteran or hemipteran insects , but are encoded in the genomes of all extant lineages of arthropoda.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of the genomic repertoires of arthropod aquaporins compared to the tetraploid complement in atlantic salmon. a maximum likelihood of arthropod orthodox aquaporins. the tree is rooted with aqpm and was inferred from  <dig> million mcmc generations on  <dig>  nucleotide sites from a codon alignment of  <dig> non-redundant aquaporins. posterior probabilities of the codon/amino acid analyses are shown at each node, with “-“ representing a polytomy . the numbers of taxa are indicated in the collapsed branch triangles. scale bars indicate the rate of nucleotide substitution per site. b bayesian majority-rule phylogeny of arthropod unorthodox aquaporins. the tree is mid-point rooted and was inferred from  <dig> million mcmc generations on  <dig>  nucleotide sites in a codon alignment of  <dig> non-redundant aquaporins. annotations as in . c genomic organisation of the salmon louse aquaporins. colored and gray boxes indicate coding and non-coding exons, respectively. long introns are annotated in kb, and gray backgrounds linking paralogs highlight conserved exons. exon numbers are annotated with roman numerals, with the first proximal and distal exons of splice variants labelled a and b, respectively. d gene copy numbers and orthology of salmon louse and atlantic salmon aquaporins



the second water-selective type classical aquaporin isolated from the louse clustered together with other maxillipod and crustacean water channels that are closely related to insect prips. previously prip-like channels, variously named as prip, aqp, aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp4a, aqp4b have only been identified in hexapoda , however the present findings reveal that prip-like water channels exist throughout the arthropoda. for most species, including the salmon louse, single copy genes were identified, although spiders  have at least two, and the centipede species studied has specifically expanded this class of aquaporins with  <dig> divergent paralogs . very recently we have also identified multiple prip-like genes in the oldest hexapod lineages, including archeognatha, diplura, collembola and protura  <cit> . in addition to the prip genes, the phylogenetic analyses show that two insect-specific classes of aquaporin exist as drip and the recently identified glycerol transporters termed entomoglyceroporins . we therefore conclude that arthropods have two ubiquitous classes of classical aquaporin proteins termed bib and pripl, while while hexapods have four, bib, prip, drip and the glycerol-transporting eglp group.

the remaining orthodox aquaporins isolated from the salmon louse clustered as canonical glps, as opposed to orthologs in bacterial symbionts . interestingly the phylogenetic signal revealed that glp evolution in arthropods appears to be polyphyletic, with multiple gene copies existing in the different lineages. for the louse, two subclusters are observed, with the first including glp <dig> co-clustering with other crustacean glps, while the second, which includes glp <dig> and − <dig>  clusters with chelicerate glps. these data suggest that glp1-type genes share a common ancestor in crustacea, while glp2- and −3-type genes have a different origin. in contrast to the polyphyletic evolution of maxillipod and chelicerate glps, however, the data for branchiopoda indicate that the glp repertoires specifically expanded within this lineage with  <dig> gene products on the same branch.

the present data reveal that aqp12-related genes are encoded in the genomes of each of the major lineages of arthropod . this latter finding is therefore consistent with previous studies that identified aqp12-like orthologs in diptera  <cit> , tardigrada  and cnidaria , the latter of which represent basal members of the panarthropoda and metazoa, respectively  <cit> . unlike the other arthropod species studied here, however, we show that the salmon louse encodes two unorthodox aquaporins , which co-cluster with other maxillipod aqp12-like sequences as a sister branch to hexapods. consequently, despite the relatively low amino acid conservation between the aqp12l <dig> and -12l <dig> paralogs , the phylogenetic data imply that the genes may have diverged within parasitic caligid copepods.

genomic structure and n-terminal splice variants
to decipher the genomic organization of the salmon louse aquaporins, we mapped each mrna sequence, including the 5′ and 3′untranslated regions , to the genomic dna. this revealed that although the bib transcript includes a second exon for the 3′utr, the bib protein is encoded within a single exon, while the coding regions of all other paralogs are located within 3– <dig> exons . the single coding exon structure of the bib protein is unusual compared to other arthropod orthologs, which are encoded by five exons in drosophila, up to nine exons in the assassin bug , and based upon the tblastn searches of whole genome shotgun sequences at least three exons in the common house spider  and at least five exons in the coastal european centipede . the intronless structure of the coding region of the louse bib gene thus appears to be specific to the salmon louse, and may have evolved via reverse transcription and replacement of an older split gene as suggested for human g-protein-coupled receptors  <cit> .

the pripl gene is by far the longest spanning > <dig> kb with four coding exons and three non-coding exons in the 5′ utr. unlike the prip of the malaria mosquito , which differentially expresses two splice variants in the ovary and gut  <cit> , no splice variants were detected for the louse pripl. by contrast two of the louse glps , which are encoded by 2– <dig> exons are transcribed as splice variants. in both cases the variation occurs at the n-terminus whereby either a proximal exon  or a distal exon  is spliced. we therefore named these isoforms glp1_v <dig>  glp1_v <dig> and glp3_v <dig>  glp3_v <dig>  respectively . interestingly, a glp1_v1-like transcript described here for the salmon louse has recently been identified through high-throughput transcriptome sequencing as a sex-specific variant termed aqp <dig> in a different parasitic copepod, caligus rogercresseyi  <cit> . to determine whether related splice variants exist in other copepods, we analyzed the available transcriptomes of five species, including the salmon louse, and found that n-terminal splice variation of both glp <dig> and −3-type genes appears to be a conserved feature within the maxillopod class of copepoda .

genomic analysis of the glp <dig> gene revealed that it is closely related to glp <dig> with 77 % nucleotide identity for the overlapping regions of exons ii and iii. since this gene has not previously been reported for any organism, and glp3-type genes are found in the transcriptome shotgun assemblies of other species of copepod, it seems likely that glp <dig> may have recently evolved as a duplicate of glp <dig> in the salmon louse. by contrast both of the louse aqp12-like genes are expressed in the transcriptomes of other caligid parasitic copepods, such as caligus rogercresseyi, but apparently not in other members of the crustacea. the genomic organisation of the louse aqp12l <dig> and -12l <dig> paralogs is conserved with  <dig> exons with an extended first intron in the aqp12l <dig> gene . although the drosphila aqp12-like gene is also split into  <dig> exons, this is not a conserved feature of unorthodox aquaporins in arthropoda as the number of exons varies between species with up to  <dig> exons in butterflies .

aquaporin orthology between parasite and host
to identify potential therapeutic targets, we compared the seven paralogs isolated from the louse to the  <dig> orthologs recently identified in its tetraploid host, the atlantic salmon , we aligned the two superfamilies and examined their phylogenetic distributions using bayesian inference. these results provided robust statistical evidence that the louse bib and pripl gene products are closely related to the salmon aqp <dig> paralogs, and thus members of the classical grade of aquaporins . similarly the louse glp and aqp12-like gene products are related to the salmon aquaglyceroporins and unorthodox aquaporins, respectively, revealing that the salmon louse superfamily consists of  <dig> major grades of aquaporins, while that of the atlantic salmon consists of four. consequently due to serial rounds of whole genome duplication in tetraploid salmonidae  <cit> , there is a 6-fold redundancy of aquaporins encoded in the genome of atlantic salmon compared to the salmon louse. a summary of these findings is given in fig. 2d which illustrates the absence of vertebrate aqp8-type aquaammoniaporins in the louse. based upon the broader molecular phylogenetic analysis , the present data further indicate that this is also true for each of the major lineages of arthropod.

channel permeation properties of the salmon louse aquaporins
to corroborate the phylogenetic and structural analyses, the functional permeation properties of the salmon louse aquaporins were examined by heterologous expression in xenopus laevis oocytes followed by measurement of the oocyte osmotic water permeability  in hypotonic media or uptake of radioactive solutes . the subcellular localization of the aquaporins in the injected oocytes was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting using specific affinity-purified antibodies raised in rabbits against synthetic c-terminal peptides . injection of 5– <dig> ng of crna and subsequent expression of pripl, glp3_v <dig> and glp3_v <dig> targeted the proteins to the oocyte plasma membrane  and induced a  <dig> – <dig> -fold increase in the oocyte water permeability compared to water injected controls . although antibody development for the glp <dig> paralog was not successful, the heterologous expression experiments showed that it functions as a water transporter. by contrast, oocytes expressing high crna titres  of the glp1_v <dig> splice variant were not permeable to water due to the retention of the channel just below the oocyte plasma membrane . addition of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate  in the bathing media was necessary to traffic the channel to the plasma membrane  and induce the increase in water permeability . this suggested that a camp-dependent phosphorylation mechanism may be involved in the trafficking of the glp_v <dig> channel to the plasma membrane as reported for some vertebrate  and plant aquaporins . an in silico analysis of the putative phosphorylation sites indicates that five residues in the n-terminus of glp1_v <dig>  differ in phosphorylation potential compared to the glp1_v <dig> isoform , implying that a casein type kinase, a protein kinase type c or a receptor tyrosine kinase  <cit>  may be involved in the trafficking of this splice variant to the oocyte plasma membrane. by contrast, the  <dig> amino acid shorter glp1_v <dig> isoform, which retains only one unique putative phosphorylation site, was not permeable to water in xenopus oocytes, even with camp added to the media. the immunolocalization and western blot experiments revealed that glp1_v <dig> was retained intracellularly  and was quickly degraded in the oocytes .fig.  <dig> immunolocalisation of salmon louse aquaporins expressed in x. laevis oocytes. a immunofluorescence photomicrographs of paraffin sections of water-  and salmon louse crna-injected oocytes probed with paralog-specific antisera followed by cy3-labeled anti-rabbit igg. arrows point to the plasma membrane. sections shown are representative of five different sections per treatment showing identical staining. b representative immunoblots of total oocyte membranes  with molecular markers shown to the left. arrows point to bands that match the predicted molecular mass of each aquaporin paralog, while lower bands likely repesent misfolded and degraded proteins. for aqp12l <dig> a cross-reaction is seen against a ~ <dig> kd x. laevis protein

while camp-dependent membrane trafficking involving the phosphorylation of c-terminal aquaporin residues is well established , the role of the n-terminus in this pathway is less common. nevertheless, the n-terminus has been associated with trafficking of some mammalian channels, including aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  <cit> . in the present context our data suggest that only the n-terminus of the glp <dig> isoforms retains putative phosphorylation sites which may be the targets of kinases in the camp-dependent trafficking mechanism. further research will be necessary to decipher the precise mechanism involved.

addition of  <dig>  mm hgcl <dig> abolished the water transport function of the pripl, glp1_v <dig> and − <dig> channels and significantly  inhibited the water permeability of oocytes expressing glp3_v <dig> and −3_v <dig> . this inhibition was reversed by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol  to glp1_v <dig>  − <dig> and −3_v <dig>  but not to pripl or glp3_v <dig>  studies of mammalian aqp <dig> channels have established that the mercury-induced inhibition is associated with the binding of hg2+ to a cys <dig> residue upstream of the second npa motif resulting in a collapse in the orientation of several residues at the ar/r region . consequently, the irreversible mercury sensitivity of the louse pripl channel may therefore be associated with three cys residues  located upstream upstream of the two npa motifs . however, as for certain piscine  <cit> , mammalian  <cit>  and plant  aquaporins, the mercury sensitivity of the other louse paralogs was independent of any cys residue upstream of either npa motif. this observation reaffirms that the mechanism of mercurial inhibition is complex and likely paralog-specific due to the position of the cys residues in the primary structures  <cit> .

heterologous expression of the bib, aqp12l <dig> and -12l <dig> channels in x. laevis oocytes did not induce any significant swelling compared to the water injected controls . the immunolocalization and western blot experiments revealed that despite being translated and expressed as 27– <dig> kd proteins, both of the unorthodox aquaporins were retained intracellularly . interestingly, although a cross reaction was noted for the aqp12l <dig> antibody in the western blot, it was not observed in the control immunohistochemical analysis, indicating that it is the aqp12l <dig> protein located in the yolk vesicles of the crna-injected oocytes. in contrast to these observations, the affinity-purified antibody developed against a c-terminal peptide of bib revealed that it is expressed as a  <dig> kd protein and trafficked to the oocyte plasma membrane . consequently the absence of water transport through the louse bib paralog is potentially due to the unusual constriction residue  on tmd <dig> , and may support its role as an ion channel and/or a cell adhesion molecule rather than a water transporter as reported for the drosophila ortholog  <cit> . further research will be necessary to identify the molecular and cell physiological function of the louse bib.

the uptake assays for urea and glycerol revealed that pripl transports a significant amount of urea compared to the controls, but not glycerol, while all of the glps expressed in the plasma membrane transport both urea and glycerol . these findings are consistent with the open pore configurations of the glps , and a recent report demonstrating that a prip ortholog isolated from the german cockroach  transports water and urea, but not glycerol  <cit> .

expression analysis of salmon louse aquaporins
to gain insight into the developmental importance of the louse aquaporins, the stage-specific expression patterns were evaluated in whole individuals in relation to elongation factor 1α  by rt-pcr. with the exception of glp1_v <dig>  each paralog was detected in all developmental stages from egg to adult . the most striking expression pattern was observed for the glp1_v <dig> isoform, which is expressed in pre-adult ii and adult males, while the glp1_v <dig> isoform is expressed in the pre-adult and adult stages of both sexes. this finding thus supports the recent observation of the differential expression of an aqp3-annotated gene in the parasitic copepod c. rogercresseyi  <cit> . it is not clear, however, whether c. rogercresseyi also expresses a shorter splice variant of this gene. to date, very few arthropod aquaporins have been identified as splice variants, and sex-specific splicing has until now only been reported in the malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae  <cit> . the present study reveals that the functional repertoire of crustacean aquaporins is increased through splice-variation, which can contribute to the sex-specific fluid homeostasis of crustaceans. further studies will be necessary to understand how the aquaporin genes are regulated and what are the subcellular sites of expression, in order to better understand the differential roles of the parasite channels compared those in the host.fig.  <dig> developmental expression of salmon louse aquaporins. rt-pcr data are shown against expression of elongation factor 1α for egg, nauplius , the infective copepodite  stage and the obligate chalimus  pre-adult  were included to exclude the possibility of non-specific amplification due to primer-dimer formation or contamination



CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we identified seven aquaporin genes in the salmon louse compared to  <dig> in its host, the atlantic salmon. however, in contrast to the salmon repertoire, which is phylogenetically divided into four major grades of classical-type water channels, aqp8-type aquaamoniaporins, aquaglyceroporins and unorthodox aquaporins, bayesian inference revealed that the salmon louse and other members of the arthropoda have lost the aqp8-type orthologs. the remaining classes of louse and non-hexapod aquaporins are classified as bib, prip-like, glps and aqp12-like channels, while hexapod insects have an additional drip channel and a specific group of eglps, which supplanted the ancestral glps as the major vehicles of glycerol conductance. heterologous expression of the cloned louse aquaporins in x. laevis oocytes showed that the prip-like channel is a water and urea transporter, while bib is not, and all but one of the glps transports water, glycerol and urea. expression data showed that each aquaporin is expressed throughout the life cycle of the salmon louse, with one exception where an n-terminal splice variant of glp1_v <dig> is specific to pre-adult and adult males. taken together, these data are the first to reveal the substrate permeability properties of aquaporins in a crustacean organism and uncover the broader genomic diversity of the superfamily in the four extant lineages of arthropoda.
