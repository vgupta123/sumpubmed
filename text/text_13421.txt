BACKGROUND
genomic tools allow investigators to devise therapies targeting specific molecular abnormalities in tumors. one such alteration is the loss of neurofibromin  <dig> , an important tumor suppressor that regulates the activity of ras gtpases  <cit> . heterozygous mutation or deletion of nf <dig> causes neurofibromatosis type  <dig> , one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders  <cit> . nf patients often develop plexiform neurofibromas , benign nerve tumors for which the only therapy is surgery. however, resection is often impossible due to the tumor’s intimate association with peripheral and cranial nerves  <cit> . pns can transform to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors , which are chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% 5-year survival  <cit> . in addition, patients with nf are susceptible to a broad spectrum of other tumors including low-grade/pilocytic astrocytomas, pheochromocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemias  <cit> . many aggressive non-nf associated  tumors have recently been shown to harbor nf <dig> mutations, including glioblastoma , neuroblastoma, melanoma, thyroid, ovarian, breast, and lung cancers  <cit> . therefore, somatic and inherited loss of nf <dig> function is emerging as a driver of tumors from different organ sites.

several groups including our own have been working to develop therapeutic approaches to target tumors with loss of nf <dig>  previously, our lab developed a high throughput approach using yeast and mammalian screening platforms to identify tool compounds and drug targets for cancer cells in which nf <dig> loss drives tumor formation. our pipeline identified small molecules that selectively kill or stop the growth of mpnst cells carrying a mutation in nf <dig> or yeast lacking the nf <dig> homolog ira <dig>  <cit> . we also developed an assay in yeast to identify the targets of our lead tool compounds and found that one of these compounds  shares a mechanism  with experimental drugs in clinical trials  <cit> . uc- <dig> impacts ctd phosphorylation, which is regulated by the ctd kinase ctk <dig>  the yeast homolog of human cdk <dig>  we showed that deletion of ctk <dig> was synthetic lethal with loss of the yeast nf <dig> homolog ira <dig>  furthermore, we have found that inhibitors of this process  can inhibit other types of ras-dysregulated tumor cells  <cit> .

however, relying on genetic data alone to identify tumors that may be susceptible to therapies targeting nf <dig> loss may leave a proportion of potentially actionable tumors unrecognized. nf <dig> tumor suppressor activity can be lost via mutation of the genomic locus, proteasome-mediated degradation, inhibition by mirna, de novo insertion of an alu element, and c → u editing of the nf <dig> mrna . this complexity presents challenges when trying to identify tumors that will benefit from molecules that exert synthetic lethality with dysregulation of nf1/ras pathways.

the cancer genome atlas  has released a large volume of data on several cancer tissues measured on a variety of genomic platforms. in the present study, we leverage tcga gbm rnaseq expression data with matched mutation calls to construct a classifier capable of identifying an nf <dig> inactivation signature. this strategy sidesteps the problem of functional characterization of mutations by evaluating a regulator’s downstream gene expression activity. we applied this signature to predict nf <dig> inactivation in a cohort of biobanked gbms. in general, this approach can be translatable to any gene producing measurable downstream transcriptome-wide effects.

methods
the cancer genome atlas data used for building the classifier
we downloaded rnaseq and mutation data from tcga pan cancer project from the ucsc xena data portal  <cit>  and subset each dataset to only the gbms  <cit> . the data consists of  <dig> gbms; of which  <dig> have mutation calls,  <dig> have rnaseq measurements, and  <dig> have both rnaseq and mutation calls. of these  <dig> samples,  <dig> have inactivating nf <dig> mutations  and were used as gold standard positives in building the classifier . additionally, to reduce dimensionality while avoiding unexpressed and invariant genes, we subset to the top  <dig>  most variably expressed genes by median absolute deviation. we z-scored all gene expression measurements. this resulted in the final input matrix with dimension  <dig> samples by  <dig>  genes. for use in platform independent predictions, we used training distribution matching  to transform the tcga rnaseq data to match a microarray expression distribution  <cit> .

since we are also aware of the nf <dig> mutation status for each of the samples, we form a supervised learning task – predicting when a sample has loss of nf <dig> activity. our “x” matrix is formed by the rnaseq measurements for all  <dig> samples measured by  <dig>  genes, which are the features in the model. our “y” vector consist of { <dig>  1} elements where a  <dig> corresponds to a sample with an inactivating nf <dig> mutation and a  <dig> is an nf <dig> wildtype sample. the machine learning task is to find the feature weights, or gene coefficients, that best minimize our objective function. along with these feature weights corresponding to the genes’ importance in the learning task, we also output a probability estimate for each sample that they have loss of nf <dig> activity.

hyperparameter optimization of the logistic regression classifier
using the gbm rnaseq data, we trained logistic regression classifiers with an elastic net penalty using stochastic gradient descent to detect tumors with nf <dig> inactivation. we chose a penalized regression model because it is simple to train and has easily interpretable outputs including importance scores for each gene  associated with the downstream consequences of nf <dig> loss of function and a probability for each sample that nf <dig> is lost. an elastic net logistic regression model has also been successfully implemented in similar studies .

we identified high-performing alpha and l <dig> mixing parameters using 5-fold cross validation ensuring balanced membership of nf <dig> mutations in each fold. briefly, alpha controls how weight penalty and the l <dig> mixing parameter tunes the amount of test set regularization by controlling the sparsity of the features. an l <dig> mixing parameter value of zero corresponds to the l <dig> penalty and a value of one corresponds to the l <dig> penalty, with l <dig> bringing a sparser solution. we used python  <dig> . <dig> and sci-kit learn for machine learning implementations  <cit> .

ensemble classifier construction and application to the validation set
after selecting optimal hyperparameters, we constructed  <dig> classifiers that would compose our ensemble model. specifically, across  <dig> different random initializations, we subset the full tcga gbm data into five folds and trained a single classifier for each training fold.

we borrowed terminology from the epidemiology field to describe data partitioning. we trained our models on a “training” partition and assessed model performance on a “test” partition, which refers to the held out cross-validation fold. the independent “validation set” refers to the gbm dataset generated in a different lab .fig.  <dig> logistic regression classifier with elastic net penalty training and testing errors over  <dig> iterations for training distribution matching  transformation of the cancer genome atlas glioblastoma rnaseq data. a schematic describing the terms used for training, testing, and validating our model. we applied 5-fold cross validation to the full dataset which consists of training and testing splits in each fold. the model is then applied as an ensemble classifier on a set of in-house samples   receiver operating characteristic  curves for all  <dig> classifiers that make up the ensemble model applied to both training and testing set. also shown is the aggregate performance of the ensemble classifier. c the cumulative density of area under the roc curve  for training and testing partitions




because of the small number of gold standard positive training examples, we were concerned about the stability of our model solutions. therefore, we constructed an ensemble classifier from the  <dig> models. specifically, we assigned each classifier a weight using the specific randomization’s “test set” cross-validation auroc. lastly, for the final nf <dig> inactivation prediction, we used the mean of the weighted predictions across all iterations as the nf <dig> inactivation prediction. we applied this ensemble classifier to the validation set in which nf <dig> protein levels were directly measured.

effect sizes and power analysis
we calculated the decision function of each ensemble classifier applied to all samples in the training and testing 5-fold cross validation folds to calculate cohen’s d effect size between predicted nf <dig> wildtype and nf <dig> inactive samples  <cit> . the cohen’s d metric quantifies the difference between nf <dig> wildtype and nf <dig> inactive samples according to the mean classifier score and directly demonstrates how different the ensemble model predicts the two groups to be.

moreover, we were also concerned that our relatively small validation set would not provide us with enough power to observe a detectable effect in the ensemble model’s final prediction. we performed a one-tailed welch’s two-sample t-test comparing the nf <dig> protein concentration of our validation samples that were predicted to be either nf <dig> wildtype or nf <dig> deficient. using the given sample size, cohen’s d effect size, and a significance threshold of α =  <dig> , we calculated the power of the prediction scores on the validation set. the power analysis was two-sample, one-tailed and incorporated unequal sample sizes in each group.

validation sample acquisition
thirteen flash-frozen, de-identified gbm samples were obtained from the maine medical center biobank. samples were received on dry ice and stored at −80 °c until isolation of dna/rna/protein. to isolate dna, tumor fragments of approximately 20 mg in mass were harvested on an aluminum block pre-chilled on dry ice. samples were then immediately transferred to a mortar and pestle containing a small volume of liquid nitrogen. the fragments were pulverized in the mortar and pestle, and the liquid nitrogen was allowed to evaporate. next, samples were immediately processed with a dna/rna/protein purification plus kit  following the standard operating protocol for animal tissue. dna concentration and quality were assessed using an nd- <dig> , a qubit fluorometer , and a fragment analyzer . to isolate rna, − <dig> c tumor fragments were placed in 5– <dig> volumes of rnalater-ice frozen tissue transition solution  and placed at −20 °c until rna extraction with a mirvana mirna isolation kit, without phenol, following the standard operating protocol . samples were homogenized using a manual homogenizer in the presence of mirvana lysis buffer. rna concentration and quality were determined using a qubit fluorometer  and a fragment analyzer . to isolate protein, small tumor fragments were pulverized and lysed in approximately three volumes of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay  buffer  containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail . samples were passed through a  <dig> 5/8 g needle and subsequently sonicated on ice to promote efficient lysis and dna shearing. after a 30 min incubation on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifuging at  <dig> × g for 20 min. hek293t, u87-mg, and u87-mg cells treated for two hours with one micromolar bortezomib  and ten micromolar mg <dig>  were also prepared in ripa buffer. protein samples were stored at −80 °c until analysis.

cell culture
u87-mg and hek293t cells were purchased from atcc. cell lines were regularly passaged and were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium  with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum  at 37 °c in 5% co <dig> 

recent data regarding the u87mg cell line published by allen et al. suggest that the u87mg cell line distributed by atcc is not from the same tumor as the cell line that was originally isolated in uppsala. transcriptome analysis comparing atcc u87mg cell line to known tumor transcriptomes indicate that the atcc u87mg cell line is a central nervous system tumor and is likely a glioblastoma cell line  <cit> .

in the present study, we employ this cell line as a control representing an nf1-deficient tumor cell line. previous studies have shown that the u87mg cell line has elevated proteasome-mediated degradation of nf <dig> and that this cell line required the loss of nf <dig> protein to promote tumorigenesis in xenograft tumor models  <cit> . given that the atcc u87mg cell line is a well-characterized and broadly-used model of nf <dig> deficient tumor cells , we propose that the use of the atcc u87mg cell line is an appropriate control for fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> performance of our classifier on a validation set. a two distinct western blots for each of our twelve samples. the controls are u87-mg, an nf <dig> wt glioblastoma cell line that exhibits proteasomal degradation of the nf <dig> protein. u87 + pi are u87-mg cells are treated with the proteasome inhibitors  mg- <dig> and bortezomib to block proteasome-mediated degradation of nf <dig>  we used the nf1/tubulin ratio normalized to u87 + pi as our nf <dig> protein level estimate. b prediction scores for each of the  <dig> classifiers weighted by cross validation test set auroc where a negative number indicates nf <dig> wildtype and a positive number is indicates nf <dig> inactivation. darker shades of blue indicate higher observed nf <dig> protein concentrations. c we quantify protein against u87 + pi and provide the mean of the weighted predictions. d based on weighted predictions, we show the abundance of nf <dig> protein compared to u87 + pi




rna microarray
after rna isolation and qc, samples were labeled for the genechip human transcriptome array  <dig>  . labeling was performed with affymetrix proprietary dna label  using a wt plus kit  provided with the hta  <dig> , following the standard operating protocol for hta  <dig> , including polya controls. hybridization, washing, and staining were performed with the wt plus kit, following the standard operating protocol for hta  <dig> . washing and staining were performed using a genechip fluidics  <dig>  scanning was performed with a genechip scanner  <dig>  these data were deposited in the gene expression omnibus under accession gse <dig> 

validation sample processing
we applied a quality control pipeline  <cit>  to all cel files generated by the hta  <dig> . all validation samples passed processing quality control, which included an inspection of spatial artifacts, ma plots, probe distributions, and sample comparison boxplots. we summarized transcript intensities using robust multi-array analysis   <cit> . we determined batch normalization was unnecessary after a guided principal components analysis  using sample processing date and array plate id as potential batch effect confounders  <cit> . lastly, we collapsed hta <dig>  transcripts into gene level measurements using the ‘collapserows()’ function with the “maxmean” method from the r package wgcna  <cit> . we used the pd.hta. <dig>  platform design file  and the bioconductor package “hta20sttranscriptcluster.db”  to map manufacturer transcript ids to genes. we performed all preprocessing steps using r version  <dig> . <dig> 

western blotting
prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein sample concentration was determined using a pierce bca protein assay kit . protein samples were prepared with 1x laemmli sample buffer  and 50 μg of tumor protein. volumes were normalized with ripa buffer including the protease/phosphatase inhibitors described above. sds-page was performed using a 4-15% mini-protean tgx gel  for 1 h at 120 v. the samples were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h and 45 min at 400 ma in cold transfer buffer  for 25 min. immunoblotting was performed with the following antibodies and conditions : anti-nf <dig> d7r7d # <dig> , anti-tubulin b-1-2- <dig> , anti-egfr d38b <dig> # <dig> , p-erk ½  # <dig> , suz <dig> d39f <dig> # <dig> . anti-nf <dig> d7r7d was a kind gift from cell signaling technologies, inc.

the binding of the primary antibodies was detected by incubation with secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit hrp 1: <dig> or goat anti-mouse hrp 1: <dig>  at room temperature in 2% milk in tbst and detection of hrp activity using pierce ecl western blotting substrate , or in the case of nf <dig>  supersignal west femto maximum sensitivity substrate . the chemiluminescent signal was captured with med-b medical x-ray film . between primary antibodies, the membrane was stripped twice for 10 min at room temperature using a mild stripping buffer containing  <dig> % w/v glycine,  <dig> % w/v sds, 1% v/v tween  <dig> at ph  <dig>  . one sample was eliminated due to low yield, and apparent degradation as determined by western blotting . densitometry was performed using li-cor image studio lite  <dig> . briefly, intensity measurements for nf <dig> and tubulin were taken using equally-sized regions for all bands. the background was subtracted using the local median intensity from the left and right borders  of each measurement region. nf <dig> values were divided by tubulin intensity to adjust for protein loading. all measurement ratios were then normalized by dividing values by the “u87 + pi” measurement for each blot, respectively.

reproducibility of computational analyses
we provide software with a permissive open source license to reproduce all computational analyses  <cit> . ensuring a stable compute environment, we performed all analyses in a docker image  <cit> . this image and source code can be used to freely confirm, modify, and build upon this work.

RESULTS
classifier performance
using 5-fold cross validation across a parameter sweep, we identified optimal hyperparameters at alpha =  <dig>  and l <dig> mixing =  <dig>  . to assess model performance, we performed  <dig> random initializations of five-fold cross-validation. these models had mean test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  of  <dig>   and a mean train auroc of  <dig>   . we repeated this procedure after tdm transformation  and achieved comparable results with alpha =  <dig>  and l <dig> mixing =  <dig>   . because the validation set was measured by microarray, we used the classifier trained on tdm transformed data to construct our ensemble classifier. we also determined the cohen’s d effect size estimate for all training and testing partitions across all 5-fold cross validation iterations of the tdm transformed model . the classifier consistently and robustly separated nf <dig> wildtype and nf <dig> inactivated gbm samples with high effect sizes .

identification and characterization of nf <dig> deficient glioblastoma tumor samples
we characterized nf <dig> protein concentrations as well as other molecules involved in ras signaling in the  <dig> gbm samples . two samples  had no apparent nf <dig> protein. eight other samples had similar or less nf <dig> signal than the u87-mg nf1-low control . two samples  had equal or greater nf <dig> than the positive control, u87-mg + proteasome inhibitors . we also observed variable egfr content in these samples, with non-existent to low levels , or medium to large egfr signal . all gbm samples had high concentrations of phospho-erk1/ <dig> signal relative to cell line controls. samples with increased phospho-erk1/ <dig> may have greater ras pathway activation. this can be attributed to multiple factors, including increased egfr expression and/or nf <dig> inactivation.

our ensemble classifier predicted four samples to have nf <dig> inactivation  and eight samples to be nf <dig> wildtype  . because two samples,  were measured on both western blots , we used the mean of their nf <dig> protein level across both experiments.

we performed a one-tailed welch’s t-test to determine if nf <dig> protein concentrations were significantly higher in nf <dig> wildtype versus nf <dig> deficient samples based on our classifier predictions . we did not observe a significant difference across groups . additionally, while the effect size was fairly large, a power analysis indicated that  <dig> samples per group would be required to achieve a power =  <dig>  at that effect size. with a lack of glioblastoma samples with quantified nf <dig> protein available, the trend of less protein present in samples scored as nf <dig> inactivated by the classifier nevertheless remains promising.

one of the samples predicted to be nf <dig> inactive contains detectable nf <dig> protein , suggesting that this sample may have nf <dig> inactivation not detectable by assaying protein, have a different alteration that phenocopies nf <dig> loss, or is incorrectly predicted by the classifier. conversely, there are three samples predicted to be nf <dig> wildtype that have low or undetectable protein , which either indicates unknown elements that confound the detection of some nf <dig> dysregulated tumors or a classification error.

highly contributing genes
we observed several genes that consistently contributed to the ensemble classifier performance . since we applied several classifiers to the validation set as an ensemble, we took the sum of all classifier’s gene weights across all  <dig> iterations to define these consistently contributing genes. while the data indicate that these genes have an impact on classifier performance, the data do not indicate whether changes in the expression of these genes are a direct consequence in changes in nf <dig> signaling. expression of genes such as txnip, arrdc <dig>  ispd, c10orf <dig>  and dusp <dig> appear to be predictive of intact nf <dig> signaling. among the list of genes that appear to be expressed in tumors with loss of nf <dig> function are qprt, atf <dig>  hus1b, peg <dig>  hmga <dig>  rsl1d <dig>  and nrg <dig>  a full list of positive and negative weight genes that were two standard deviations beyond the gene weight distribution is provided in additional file 6: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> genes that contribute to the classifier performance. genes are shown ranked by their weighted contribution to the ensemble classifier. weights are scaled to unit norm. the top ten positive and top ten negative contributing high weight genes are given on the right




we also performed over-representation analysis of the most influential genes in the classifier to identify gene ontology  sets and pathways that may be predictive of nf <dig> status . for high-weight genes predictive of intact nf <dig> signaling, we observed go sets involved in plasma membrane-localized proteins  and homeostasis , among others. annotated pathways associated with genes from this dataset include hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, thyroid cancer, voltage-gated potassium channels, and rho gtpase functional pathways.

for high-weight genes predictive of nf <dig> loss of function, we observed go sets related to cellular adhesion , negative regulation of signaling , and nervous system development , among others. these genes were also enriched for elements of the phototransduction cascade and thyroxine production pathways.

discussion
a machine learning classifier, based on gene expression data, can capture signal associated with the inactivation of a tumor suppressor. our classifier is able to detect subtle downstream changes in gene expression as a result of the tumor responding to nf <dig> loss of function. this finding supports using mrna as a summary measurement capable of capturing system-wide responses to molecular events beyond transcription factor alterations. machine learning has been applied to gene expression in a variety of studies with various goals . in a similar study, guinney et al. trained a classifier to model ras activity in colorectal cancer and demonstrated its clinical utility by predicting response to mek inhibitors and anti-egfr based treatments  <cit> . with a wealth of signal embedded in gene expression and a rapidly growing library of datasets, the performance of machine learning models is likely to rapidly improve. an increase in performance leads to more reliable clinical applications that would potentially predict the effectiveness of pathway-specific targeted therapies.

while our classifier was able to predict nf <dig> inactivation status to an extent, its performance is far from being clinically actionable. a major difficulty in developing a reliable classifier in this case is contamination in gold standard positives and negatives. while we aim to detect nf <dig> inactivation events, our gold standard positives can only include samples with known nf <dig> mutation status. conversely, we expect that negative samples  are also contaminated with nf <dig> inactivated samples due to protein loss and other mechanisms. we cannot determine scenarios where nf <dig> is inactivated beyond mutation at scale in the tcga data. another challenge with the construction of classifiers from such data is overfitting. even after hyperparameter optimization we observed substantial overfitting , which has also been observed in competitions . finally with a small number of positive examples the model performance is unstable, which demonstrates high variability in gold standard samples used to train the model  <cit> . we employed ensemble classification to mitigate this issue as averaging over heterogeneous models would result in a relatively stable classifier . in summary, our results are promising but these challenges are substantial and significant work remains to reach a robust classifier with clinical utility.

the performance of the classifier appears to be impacted by many cancer related genes. for example, genes such as txnip and arrdc <dig>  which are both indicative of lactic acidosis, correlate with better clinical outcomes, and contribute to predicting tumors with intact nf <dig> signaling  <cit> . we also observed transcripts that are more highly expressed in brain tissue than either other normal tissue , or more highly expressed in normal brain tissue than glioma  . dusp <dig> contributes to the prediction of nf <dig> wildtype status and is a negative regulator of erk phosphorylation, possibly by regulating shp <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . it is unclear whether the expression of these genes is a direct result of nf <dig> expression, the result of signaling downstream of nf <dig>  or a consequence of other phenomena . future studies could elucidate the potential connections between nf <dig> and the genes identified as important for the performance of this classifier.

over-representation analysis of these data highlighted changes in potassium channel expression. it was previously demonstrated that nf <dig> wild-type schwann cells have altered k+ channel activity as compared to nf1
−/− schwann cells suggesting that this may be one factor by which nf <dig> mutant and wild-type cells can be distinguished  <cit> .

regarding prediction of nf <dig> inactivated tumors, we observed several genes that have been linked to cancer such as qprt, which is highly expressed in malignant pheochromocytomas as compared to benign; rsl1d <dig> , which stabilizes c-myc in hepatocellular carcinoma; ppef, which is highly expressed in astrocytic gliomas as compared to normal brain tissue ; and peg <dig>  a poor prognostic marker and regulator of proliferation, migration, and invasion in several tumor types . we also observed atf <dig>  a gene for which expression in malignant glioma is correlated with poor survival  <cit> . knockdown of atf <dig> in gbm cells causes cell death in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . analysis of genes that contribute to the prediction of nf <dig> inactivation yielded several go terms related to neural development. it is well established that loss of nf <dig> can result in abnormal neural development and/or tumorigenesis  <cit> . we also observed genes associated with the mesodermal commitment pathway, components of which are linked to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human cancer cells . analysis of this pathway may be informative in identifying tumors with nf <dig> loss because mesenchymal gbms are enriched for tumors with nf <dig> loss  <cit> .

our ensemble classifier was able to robustly detect the samples with the highest and lowest nf <dig> protein concentrations, but it struggled with samples of intermediate nf <dig> concentrations. this could be a result of an enrichment of mechanisms causing nf <dig> inactivation beyond protein abundance, an overrepresentation of mesenchymal tumors in nf <dig> inactivated samples contaminating dataset splits  <cit> , poor classifier generalizability, or incomplete data transformation between rnaseq and microarray data. because training and testing performance were similar between transformed and non-transformed data  we don’t anticipate performance to be impacted much by platform differences or classifier generalizability. nevertheless, we demonstrated the ability of system-wide gene expression measurements to capture downstream consequences of a complex biological mechanism that would otherwise require several different types of data acquisition to capture.

CONCLUSIONS
a machine learning classifier for transcriptomic data was able to detect signal associated with the inactivation of nf <dig>  a tumor suppressor gene. the gene is an important regulator of the oncogene ras and is inactivated frequently in gbm and in other tumors. the measurement of nf <dig> inactivity cannot be comprehensively captured by any single genomic characterization such as targeted sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization. this difficulty arises from diverse and complex biological mechanisms that inactivate the tumor suppressor in a variety of ways. however, we demonstrated that measuring system-wide rna can capture subtle downstream changes that occur in response to nf <dig> inactivation. improving classification performance is required before transitioning such a model into clinical use, but our method could be used to characterize cell lines or patient-derived xenograft  models with inactive nf <dig>  eventually, with more data and improved classification, we expect machine-learning models constructed on system-wide transcriptomics will translate into clinically relevant predictions that will guide targeted therapy.
