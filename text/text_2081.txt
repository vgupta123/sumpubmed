BACKGROUND
macaques  represent one of the most successful extant primate radiations. they colonized a large geographic range, from continents to islands, making them unique among non-human primates  <cit> . fossils indicate that they arose in northern africa around  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . during their expansion into asia in the late miocene, the genus diversified into various species groups and species that have been defined by morphological, behavioral and molecular characters, and by their geographic distribution  <cit> .

taxonomic and phylogenetic affiliations of the various macaque species have been matter of debate for several decades  <cit> . according to current classifications the genus comprises  <dig> species, which are divided into seven species groups  <cit> ; among them three monotypic species groups,  the m. sylvanus group,  the m. arctoides group and  the m. fascicularis group, and four polytypic groups,  the sulawesi macaques group with six species,  the m. mulatta group with three species,  the m. sinica group with five species and  the m. silenus group with five species. as with the other species groups, the species composition of the m. fascicularis group has changed over time. delson  <cit>  and fooden  <cit>  included four species , but groves  <cit>  moved m. mulatta, m. cyclopis and m. fuscata in their own species group, the m. mulatta group, and integrated m. arctoides in the m. fascicularis group. zinner et al.  <cit>  likewise recognized the members of the m. mulatta group as a distinct species group and additionally excluded m. arctoides proposing a monotypic m. fascicularis group.

the long-tailed macaque  has the most discontinuous, and beside rhesus macaques, the largest distribution of all macaque species. its range covers the southern part of the southeast asian mainland  as well as most of sundaland  and beyond  . on the basis of differences in pelage coloration and tail length ten subspecies are currently recognized  <cit> . three of them  have relatively large distributions, while all others  are restricted to small islands . however, genetic data are not yet available for a comparative assessment of this classification; so far, genetic studies have included only samples from m. f. fascicularis and m. f. philippinensis. given the large and discontinuous range of m. f. fascicularis, it is not surprising that  variation within this subspecies is high  <cit> . in fact, there is a deep genetic differentiation between m. f. fascicularis from the asian mainland and from sundaland  <cit> . interestingly, on sumatra, y-chromosomal lineages from both, mainland and sundaland are found  <cit> . besides the genetic variation among local long-tailed macaque populations, molecular studies have also revealed significant gene flow from rhesus macaques  into indochinese m. f. fascicularis  <cit> . recent genome data indicate that around 30% of the asian mainland m. fascicularis genome is of rhesus macaque origin  <cit> . this ancient hybridization  most likely occurred unidirectional , from rhesus into long-tailed macaques and not vice versa, i.e. analyses of maternally inherited markers such as mitochondria will not resolve the question of hybridization  <cit> . even today, hybridization between both species occurs in a wide hybrid zone running from vietnam, through laos, thailand, and probably into myanmar  <cit> . since the long-tailed macaque is an important model organism in biomedical research, reliable knowledge about its evolutionary history and genetic composition is essential for biomedical inferences, particularly since local populations show extreme genetic, physiological and behavioral variation .figure  <dig>

the geographic origin of m. fascicularis and dispersal scenarios that led to its current distribution are still a matter of debate. delson  <cit>  suggested that macaques entered sundaland, probably in the pliocene, during periods of low sea level and ancestral m. fascicularis became isolated there when rising sea levels and geological activity fragmented sundaland. during the pleistocene, m. fascicularis extended its range again  <cit> . this largely corresponds to the observed higher level of nucleotide diversity found in long-tailed macaque populations from sundaland compared to the populations from the asian mainland and malay peninsula  <cit> . this scenario is also in agreement with the fact that the earliest fossils of m. fascicularis, or at least those of a close relative, were found on java  <cit> . currently, the species is also found on islands that were never connected to the asian mainland or sundaland, including islands beyond the wallace line  and the philippines. accordingly, it was assumed that humans introduced m. fascicularis to the islands east of the wallace line ca.  <dig>  year ago  <cit> , while the philippines were most likely naturally colonized during two independent immigration events  <cit> . the species’ survival in areas, where it has been introduced by humans , indicates its significant ecological plasticity. long-tailed macaques are naturally adapted to riverine and coastal environments such as mangrove and gallery forests  <cit> . they primarily feed on fruits and seeds  <cit> , but as indicated by one of its common names, crab-eating macaque, they also include crabs, shrimps, clams and fish in their diet  <cit> . they are able to swim and even to dive  <cit> . hence, it is likely that long-tailed macaques were able to cross short distances between islands actively.

the objective of this study is to shed more light on the phylogeny of m. f. fascicularis, the most widespread subspecies of the long-tailed macaques, occurring on the southeast asian mainland and sundaland islands, including parts of the philippines and east as far as timor. therefore, we generated complete mitochondrial  genomes from  <dig> long-tailed macaque individuals either by traditional polymerase chain reaction  amplification followed by sanger sequencing or by dna-capture and high-throughput sequencing. we expect that the analysis of complete mtdna genomes provides a better resolution of phylogenetic relationships among lineages than only short mtdna fragments.

RESULTS
we generated  <dig> complete mtdna genome sequences from 40 m. fascicularis individuals, either by classical pcr followed by sanger sequencing  or by dna-capture and high-throughput sequencing . for two museum samples  both methods were applied which yielded sequences with 100% identity, thus indicating similarly high accuracy of both methods. for mtdna genomes that were captured and sequenced on the ion pgm sequencing platform we obtained an average of  <dig>   trimmed reads with an average read length of 96 bp, resulting in an average 285-fold coverage. sequences in the overlapping parts were identical and all protein-coding genes were correctly translated without any premature stop codons, indicating that no nuclear mitochondrial-like sequences  are present in our dataset. all newly generated mtdna genomes had a length of  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, and consisted of  <dig> transfer rna genes,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes,  <dig> protein coding genes and the control region.

for phylogenetic analysis, we generated an alignment including the  <dig> newly generated and  <dig> additional mtdna genomes downloaded from genbank. the resulting alignment had a length of  <dig>  bp, but was reduced to  <dig>  bp after indels and poorly aligned positions were removed. some m. f. fascicularis individuals shared the same haplotype . these were excluded resulting in a final alignment of  <dig> unique primate mtdna genome haplotypes. both alignments are available for download . phylogenetic trees as obtained from maximum-likelihood  and bayesian analyses are nearly identical and most nodes are strongly supported . according to estimated divergence ages, hominidae and cercopithecidae separated  <dig>   million years ago  . among hominids, pongo diverged from the homo + pan clade  <dig>   ma, while the latter split  <dig>   ma. among cercopithecids, colobus diverged first,  <dig>   ma, and chlorocebus separated from papionins  <dig>   ma. in the papionini clade, theropithecus and papio diverged from macaques  <dig>   ma, while the former two genera split  <dig>   ma. within macaques, the african m. sylvanus branched off first,  <dig>   ma. the remaining, solely asian macaque species, diverged into two clades  <dig>   ma, one comprising m. silenus and m. tonkeana, and the other m. thibetana, m. arctoides, m. mulatta and m. fascicularis. in the former clade, m. silenus and m. tonkeana separated  <dig>   ma, while in the latter clade m. thibetana split off first,  <dig>   ma, followed by m. fascicularis  <dig>   ma, before finally m. mulatta and m. arctoides diverged  <dig>   ma. within m. fascicularis, an initial split occurred  <dig>   ma, separating haplotypes from mainland southeast asia, peninsula malaysia and north sumatra , and haplotypes from borneo, java, bangka, timor, the philippines and mauritius . in clade a, individuals from mainland southeast asia, peninsula malaysia and north sumatra do not form reciprocally monophyletic clades. splitting events in clade a started  <dig>   ma. in clade b, individuals from different geographic regions form monophyletic clades or represent distinct lineages. the only exception is the borneo clade, which also includes the individual from the philippines . in clade b, the branching pattern among main clades/lineages remains unresolved  indicating a diversification within a short time period. in fact, this radiation was estimated to have occurred between  <dig>  ma  and  <dig>   ma, thus in less than  <dig>  years. individuals from bangka , an island east of sumatra , form a monophyletic clade and separated from the borneo/philippines clade  <dig>   ma. the philippine individual is nested within the borneo clade and specifically clusters with an individual from sabah ; they diverged from each other  <dig>   ma.figure  <dig>

discussion
by applying different methods, classical pcr amplification followed by sanger sequencing and dna-capture with subsequent high-throughput sequencing, we successfully obtained complete mtdna genome data from 40 m. fascicularis individuals. both methods have proven to be useful to gain such data with similarly high accuracy, but the dna-capture and high-throughput sequencing approach is less costly and time consuming  <cit> . moreover, dna extracted from museum material and fecal material is normally highly degraded. fortunately, some of our museum and fecal samples contained dna in sufficient quality so that the complete mtdna genome could be amplified via  <dig> overlapping pcrs. usually, due to the high degree of dna degradation, generating complete mtdna genomes would require a much larger number of pcr amplifications. in contrast, dna-capture does not need a certain dna fragment size, because any size of dna fragment can be captured and subsequently sequenced. however, degraded dna should be solely investigated in special laboratories and with various precautions to prevent contamination.

our results concerning the phylogenetic relationships among macaque and non-macaque taxa and estimated divergence ages are largely in line with previous molecular studies  <cit> . for the phylogenetic relationships among m. fascicularis haplotypes, we obtained higher statistical support for most nodes in our tree, as compared to earlier mtdna studies which used only fragments of the mtdna genome  <cit> . nevertheless, some nodes in our study are still missing significant statistical support, thus leaving some phylogenetic relationships, in particular those between populations from timor, java, mauritius and bangka/borneo/philippines, unresolved. such results are common when clades or lineages diverged within a short time period  <cit> .

in contrast to tosi and coke  <cit>  who found sumatran individuals to be part of the sundaland clade , the sumatran individuals, which we analyzed, are nested within the asian mainland clade . a possible explanation for this contradiction is the different geographic origin of studied individuals, with the south sumatran samples of tosi and coke  <cit>  clustering with sundaland sequences and our north sumatran samples clustering with mainland sequences. thus, both major m. f. fascicularis mtdna clades are likely to be present on sumatra similar to the presence of both y chromosomal haplogroups on the island  <cit> .

since mtdna is only inherited via the maternal line and macaques live mainly in female philopatric societies  <cit> , mtdna data can be utilized to reveal insights into genetic differences among regional populations and to trace their phylogeographic history  <cit> . according to our phylogenetic reconstruction and estimated divergence ages, m. f. fascicularis initially split into two clades  <dig>   ma, with representatives of both lineages being found today on sumatra . possible explanations therefore are  sumatra is the place of origin of m. f. fascicularis,  sumatra is the place of origin of only sundaland m. f. fascicularis, while long-tailed macaques from the mainland invaded the island later, or  long-tailed macaques on sumatra became extinct and the island was later re-colonized from the mainland and other sundaland islands. the hypothesis that sumatra is the place of m. f. fascicularis origin is supported by the observed high mtdna diversity found on the island compared to other regions where the subspecies occurs . however, not in support of this hypothesis is the paraphyly of haplotypes from the mainland and malay peninsula, and the respective branching pattern among them and the sumatra haplotypes, which suggests that the northern sumatra population came in from the mainland. to test whether sumatra or any other island, e.g., java  <cit>  is the place of origin of sundaland or all m. f. fascicularis populations, needs further investigations and, particularly, should include data of m. f. fascicularis from southern sumatra.

as in previous studies  <cit> , we found long-tailed macaques from the philippines clustering within the borneo clade. since the bornean individual, which is most closely related to the philippine specimens, is from the furthest east of borneo , this branching pattern fosters the previously proposed hypothesis of a colonization of the philippines via borneo  <cit> . within the last million years, the philippines have never been connected to the southeast asian mainland or borneo via a continuous land bridge  <cit> . one possible exception is the island of palawan, which has been considered to have had a land connection to borneo during sea level low-stands in the late pleistocene  <cit> . the previously proposed philippine colonization hypothesis  <cit>  via palawan and appending islets seems plausible . a recent study suggests that there may have been at least two dispersal events from borneo into the philippines, first one via palawan resulting in m. f. philippinensis found in the north of the philippine archipelago , and a later one via the sulu archipelago that resulted in m. f. fascicularis in the south  <cit> . our philippine sample most likely belongs to this southern taxon.

one noteworthy outcome from our study is the early divergence of a monophyletic timor clade within the sundaland clade . it appears that this clade diverged some  <dig>   ma from the other sundaland lineages. this finding is supported by an analysis of blood protein polymorphisms from samples across the indonesian and timor island arc, indicating that populations east of the wallace line  have greatly differentiated from those to the west  <cit> . our mtdna-based estimate, however, significantly predates the earliest finds of macaques in timor’s archaeological record, which appear at the same time, i.e. as the first evidence of pottery and domesticated pig in one site a few thousand years ago, indicating human translocations  <cit> . similarly, on flores, an island further west, but still east of the wallace line, long-tailed macaques only appear in the archaeological record around  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . it is unclear what underlies the apparent major discrepancy between the present phylogenetic analysis and the zooarchaeological record, but an introduction by humans as proposed by fooden  <cit>  seems unlikely, although the possibility remains that the detected timor haplotypes originated from somewhere else in sundaland, a place that was not sampled in our study.

CONCLUSIONS
both applied laboratory methods have proven to be powerful to generate complete mtdna genome data with similarly high accuracy, with the dna-capture and high-throughput sequencing approach as the most promising and only practical option to obtain such data from highly degraded dna, fast and relatively cheap. our study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of m. f. fascicularis, most prominent we obtained first evidence for the presence of haplotypes in north sumatra that are related to asian mainland haplotypes and the clearly distinct and phylogenetically old timor clade. however, to fully resolve the phylogeny of long-tailed macaques, to identify their origin and the dispersal routes leading to their current distribution, to assess their full genetic diversity and to explore to which extent secondary gene flow occurred between local populations, it is fundamental to include further m. f. fascicularis populations from throughout their range into future studies. in these studies both, mitochondrial and a large number of nuclear loci, should be analyzed. moreover, to fully understand the evolutionary history of the species, the other subspecies of m. fascicularis should be incorporated in such studies as well. since long-tailed macaques are an important model species in biomedical research and considering intra-specific variation in genetics, physiology and behavior, more attention should be paid to the selection of study specimens.
