BACKGROUND
rna once is considered as the fundamental information medium in central dogma of molecular biology. a number of studies have indicated that rnas play a more active role and carry diverse functionalities in nature, including mediating the synthesis of proteins, regulating cellular activities, and exhibiting enzyme-like catalysis and post-transcriptional activities. furthermore, many recent discoveries have shown that the number and biological significance of functional rnas has been underestimated. in living cells, rnas do not remain in a linear form, which folds its secondary structure through base pairs including canonical bonds of a-u and g-c and wobble pair of g-u. for understanding rna's functionality, the alignment and similarity of rna should consider not only the primary structure  but also the secondary structure .

numerous approaches were proposed to measure the similarity between rna secondary structures, which can be broadly categorized into two classes: alignment based string or tree representation of rna secondary structure, and comparison based some numerical representation without alignment.

most studies usually adopt dynamic programming algorithms and tree models. some are usually based on the alignment of a string representation of the secondary structures such as the dot-bracket representation, in which a score function or a distance function to represent insertion, deletion and substitution of letters in the compared structures  <cit> . sequences considered in alignment of rna secondary structures are not only string sequences but also secondary structure. different weights or different score functions are designed for unpaired nucleotides and paired nucleotides.

others are almost based on alignment of a tree representation of the rna secondary structure elements or the base pairing probability matrices  <cit> . shapiro  <cit>  proposed various tree models used for representing rna secondary structures without pseudoknots.

each tree model offers a more or less detailed views of an rna structure. given the tree representations of two rna secondary structure, one comparison way is based on the computation of the edit distance between the trees while the other focus on the alignment of the trees using the score of the alignment as a measure of the distance between the trees. popular tools for optimal alignment of rna secondary structures include rnadistance  <cit>  and rnaforester  <cit>  etc. rnadistance compares rna secondary structures based on tree edit distance measure, while rnaforester computes the pairwise or multiple alignment of structures based on tree alignment measure. hofacker  <cit>  measured rna secondary structures in terms of the base pairing probability matrices computed by mccaskill's partition function algorithm  <cit> . the popular tool based matrix of base pairing probabilities is rnapdist, which was implemented as part of the vienna rna package.

because the above methods rely on dynamic programming algorithms, they are computation-intensive even if the pseudoknots are ignored. for example, the sankoff's algorithm  <cit>  simultaneously allows the structure prediction and alignment problem with o in memory and o in time for two rna sequences of lengthn. so these algorithms are still impractical for long rna sequences. recently some comparison algorithms without aligning them are proposed. kin  <cit>  gave a kernel method based on stochastic context free grammar .

the graphical representations of biosequences  could be out of the mainstream but a new research view and tool to understand and analyze such biosequences. m.randic  <cit>  reviewed the sufficient materials on related topics of graphical representations of protein, dna and the secondary structure of rna. inspired by several graphical representations of dna sequences  <cit> , some researchers have proposed 2d, 3d or 4d graphical approaches for the representations of rna secondary structure and then derive some numerical invariants and different graphical measures from graphs to compare rna secondary structures  <cit> .

in  <cit> , eight symbols of the unpaired bases a, c, g, u and paired bases a′, c′, g′, u′ were used to code rna secondary structures as graphical representations. in  <cit> , the representations of eight letters have been demonstrated to be approximate and have some loss of information. in  <cit> ,  <dig> symbols have been used to represent rna secondary structure without loss of information, in which the key is to discriminate between the first and the second base of a hydrogen bond for the paired bases.

in this paper, motivated by dv curve representation of dna sequences  <cit> , we propose a novel triple vector curve representation of rna secondary structure. with this novel representation, a new rna secondary structure similarity measure based on wavelet analysis is designed, which can simultaneously focus on the local structure and global structure. to evaluate our algorithms, we take the classification of non-coding rna and rna mutation as examples to compare to the two popular tools of rnadistance and rnapdist.

RESULTS
similarities/dissimilarities among non-coding rna from different families
we performed the experiments on  <dig> rna sequences to test the ability to distinguish non-coding rna families. we randomly chose  <dig> sequences from each of the four rna classes  in rfam database.

firstly, the secondary structures of the  <dig> rna sequences are predicted by the vienna rna folding prediction package. secondly, their characteristic representations are constructed according to the primary sequence and the predicted secondary structure. thirdly, the tv-curves can be obtained based on their characteristic representations. then we computed the similarity between any two rna among these  <dig> rna sequences by the proposed multi-scale similarity measure algorithm based on tv-curve. furthermore, all the similarity values are arranged into a similarity matrix. for validation of our algorithm, we computed the distance matrixes using rnapdist and rnadistance tools respectively.

for the comparison of our multi-scale similarity measure with the popular rna comparison tools, the validation index used here is hubert’s statistic  <cit> . let x and y be n×n matrices, where x indicates the observed similarity coefficient between the rna i and j, and y represents the ground information defined as follows:

 yi,j={ <dig> ifrnaiandjareinthesamefamily <dig> otherwise 

if x indicates the observed distance between rna i and j, then y is defined as

 yi,j={ <dig> if  rnaiandjare in the same family <dig> otherwise 

the hubert's statistic represents the correlation between the matrices x and y , which is defined as follows:

 h=2nn−1∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nxi,j−x―σxyi,j−y―σy=∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nxi,j−x―yi,j−y―∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nxi,j−x―2∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nyi,j−y― <dig> 

where x― and y― denote the means of the matrices of x and y. the larger absolute value of h indicates the better coherence between the similarity matrix x and the ground matrix y. the value of h can be used to estimate the quality of the similarity measure.

the hubert's statistic for different similarity matrixes are shown in table  <dig>  the hubert statistic of rnapdist and rnadistance are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

however, the hubert's statistic of our proposed multi-scale similarity measure based on our algorithm is  <dig> . obviously, our similarity measure is more closer to the real data compared with rnapdist and rnadistance.

in addition, to further compare the performance of our method with the rnapdist and rnadistance, we reconstructed three phylogenetic trees  using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean   <cit>  according to the pairwise similarities of the rna sequences obtained by multi-scale similarity measure algorithm based on tv-curve, rnapdist and rnadistance, respectively.

obviously, compared additional file 1: figure s <dig> and figure s <dig> with figure  <dig>  the phylogenetic tree based on our proposed measure presents clearly four branches. the four branches of figure  <dig> can be regarded as the classification of the  <dig> rna sequences, where branch  <dig> with  <dig> rnasep_archs, branch  <dig> with  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rnasep_archs, branch  <dig> with  <dig> mirna and  <dig> trna, and branch  <dig> with  <dig> 5s_rrnas and  <dig> trnas. it is easy to obtain the false percentage is 5%. moreover, the  <dig> rnasep_archs in branch  <dig> and  <dig> trna in branch  <dig> are both isolated from the  <dig> trnas and  <dig> mirna respectively. the distinguished performance of our proposed method is better than the popular rna comparison rnapdist and rnadistance tools.

similarities/dissimilarities among the rna secondary structures of nine virus
to further illustrate the utility of our approach for the subtle structure comparison, we examine similarities /dissimilarities of a set of relatively similar rna secondary structures at the 3’-terminus of nine different viruses. the nine virus include alfalfa mosaic virus , citrus leaf rugose virus , tobacco streak virus , citrus variegation virus , apple mosaic virus , prune dwarf ilarvirus , lilac ring mottle virus , elm mottle virus  and asparagus virus ii . the predicted corresponding secondary structures and corresponding tv-curves are given in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  their similarity matrix obtained by multi-scale similarity measure is shown in table  <dig> 

the maximal similarity is  <dig> .

to further present our result, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with upga algorithm for the nine virus using the multi-scale similarity measure based on tv-curves shown in figure  <dig> 

observing table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  we find the most similar species pairs are  and , and the next similar species pairs are ,,  and . the results are analogous to the difference of the secondary structures in figure  <dig>  which show that our approach also present the better performance for similar secondary structure comparison.

rna mutation analysis
mutations in rna structure may lead to impair functions resulting in diseases, but rna structure mutations could be beneficial in some situation. consequently, it is very important to search the most significant point mutation. our proposed method is very efficient to find the significant point mutation compared with the popular rna mutation analysis tool: rdmas  <cit> . rdmas is a web server for evaluating structural deleteriousness of single nucleotide mutation in rna genes. we evaluate single nucleotide structure mutation microrna mir- <dig> precursor based on tv-curve representation and compared to rdmas tool. meanwhile compared to rnadistance and rnapdist, we predict the most significant point mutation shown in figure  <dig>  in rdmas, the maximum difference in structures between the wild-type and the possible mutation at each position are extracted into a structural deleteriousness profile. we compare the deleteriousness profiles and their histograms between our method, rnadistance and rnapdist . as shown in figure 6b, it is obviously to see that our method can find more significant structural mutations compared with rnadistance and rnapdist.

additionally, in order to further validate the efficiency of our method, we test the  <dig> rrna fragments of the thermus thermophilus from ribosomal data-set in  <cit>  compared with rnadistance and rnapdist. the labels and sequences are listed in table s <dig> . in table s <dig> , the most significant mutation position and type are listed for rnamsctv-curve , rnadistance and rnapdist. out of the  <dig> rna sequences in the data set,  <dig> fragments ,a_,a_, a_) produced the same most significant mutation as rnadistance and rnapdist. our proposed structure for the rest fragments are more different than the structure with the largest rnadistance and rnapdist but it is non-obvious to determine which one of them is more significant. both of the mutations alter the structure with respect to the original structure. the results in figure s <dig>  provide further evidence that our method can capture more significant and subtle structure mutation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we provide a better visualization and analysis tool tv-curve for rna to indicate the information of sequence and secondary structure especially for long rna. additionally, based on tv-curves representation of rna, a multi-scale similarity measure for rna comparison is proposed, which can capture the local and global difference between the information of sequence and structure of rna. compared with the popular rna comparison approaches, the proposed method is evaluated to be outstanding and effective. but as we know, the native secondary structure of a rna is often a suboptimal structure not the predicted structure with minimum free energy  due to limitations of thermodynamic models. the structural similarity measurement using multiple predicted suboptimal structures is still a challenge. in the further research, we will focus on how to measure the structural similarity to integrate multiple structures with different energy levels.
