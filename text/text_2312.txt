BACKGROUND
in addition to clearing neurotransmitters and maintaining ionic balance, astrocytes can mediate neurovascular coupling, modulate neuronal excitability, and promote synaptic formation and remodeling . these functions are likely to be modulated by the sleep/wake cycle, but as yet little is known about the effects of sleep/wake on astrocyte functions. several experiments focused on glycogen, which in the brain is mainly present in astrocytes, testing the hypotheses that sleep serves to restore glycogen deposits or that glycogen levels during wake affect sleep need. however, it was found that the overall effect of wake is to increase glycogen turnover rather than to cause its depletion, providing little support to the original hypotheses  <cit> . on the other hand, astrocytes can affect sleep. intracellular recordings of neurons and glia under slow-wave anesthesia show that by buffering k+ and ca++ fluxes, astrocytes modulate the timing of the on and off phases of the slow oscillation  <cit> , the fundamental cellular phenomenon that underlies non-rapid eye movement  sleep  <cit> . moreover, dnsnare mice, in which gliotransmission is blocked, show a blunted homeostatic increase in sleep slow waves after sleep deprivation  <cit> , although new evidence shows that the dnsnare transgene is also expressed in cortical neurons  <cit> . finally, extracellular cortical levels of lactate and glutamate increase with wake and decrease with nrem sleep in a manner that reflects sleep depth  <cit> , suggesting that glycolytic activity in astrocytes, likely through its link with glutamatergic transmission, reflects sleep homeostasis.

here we first employed translating ribosome affinity purification  technology combined with microarray analysis to obtain a genome-wide sleep/wake profiling of astrocytic transcripts in the mouse forebrain. the expression of an egfp-l10a ribosomal transgene was targeted to cells expressing 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase , with the goal of tagging polysomes and immunoaffinity purify mrnas  <cit> . although there is no comprehensive and entirely specific molecular marker for astrocytes  <cit> , aldh1l <dig> is more inclusive than glial fibrillary acidic protein , and its expression is not limited to specific cortical areas or layers  <cit> . as a result, we isolated astrocytic mrnas attached to ribosomes, and thus presumably poised to become proteins. we then used serial block face scanning electron microscopy   <cit>  to test whether sleep, acute sleep deprivation and chronic sleep restriction affect the ultrastructure of astrocytic processes contacting cortical spines. both sleep and astrocytes affect synaptic plasticity, and sleep need increases not only with the duration of wake, but also with the extent of the plastic changes that occur during wake  <cit> . we focused on layer ii of the prefrontal cortex, because supragranular layers are highly plastic  <cit>  and the slow-wave activity  of nrem sleep, which reflects the need for sleep and its depth, is highest in frontal areas  <cit> .

RESULTS
molecular studies
the brains of three adult heterozygous aldh1l <dig> – egfp-l10a bacterial artificial chromosome  transgenic mice were processed for immunocytochemistry using antibodies against enhanced green fluorescent protein , an astrocytic marker , an oligodendrocytic marker , and a neuronal marker . gfp immunofluorescence was restricted to non-neuronal, non-oligodendrocytic cells , consistent with previous evidence  <cit> . some gfp-labeled cells did not express gfap, also in line with published data  <cit> . thus, these results confirm that aldh1l <dig> is a more inclusive astrocytic marker than gfap.fig.  <dig> aldh1l1-egfp expression is specific for astrocytes. top panels: double-labeling studies showing colocalization of aldh1l1-egfp  and the astrocytic marker gfap . aldh1l <dig> is expressed also in gfap– astrocytes. middle and bottom panels: double-labeling studies showing the absence of colocalization between aldh1l1-egfp  and the oligodendrocyte marker cnp  or the neuronal marker neun . scale bar = 15 μm



sleep/wake pattern and response to sleep deprivation are normal in aldh1l <dig> – egfp-l10a mice
we first tested whether aldh1l <dig> – egfp-l10a mice showed a normal sleep/wake cycle by making chronic electroencephalographic  recordings that lasted for several days, including during and after sleep deprivation. mice  showed robust entrainment to the light–dark cycle, sleeping mainly during the day and staying awake most of the night, as expected for nocturnal animals. during baseline, nrem sleep accounted for  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the 24-hr cycle, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the light period, while the corresponding values for rapid eye movement  sleep were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % . as expected, nrem sleep was predominant in the first part of the light phase relative to the second part . the mean duration of nrem and rem episodes, number of brief arousals, and several other sleep parameters were all within the range reported for most mouse lines .fig.  <dig> sleep/wake pattern and response to sleep deprivation in aldh1l <dig> – egfp-l10a mice. a twenty-four hour sleep/wake patterns. b, c twenty-four hour time course of nrem duration and swa for baseline  and sleep deprivation . *p <  <dig> , significant increase during the first 2 hr of recovery sleep after sd relative to the first 2 hr of bsl . for a-c, values are mean ± standard error of the mean. white and black bars indicate the light and dark periods, respectively



in mammals, swa – the eeg power between  <dig>  and  <dig>  hz – reflects both the need for sleep and its depth  <cit> . indeed, swa levels increase as a function of prior wake duration and decline in the course of sleep. moreover, arousal thresholds are higher when swa is higher. changes in swa were studied after aldh1l <dig> – egfp-l10a mice were deprived of sleep during the first 4 hr of the light period. during sleep deprivation, they spent less than 2 % of their time in nrem sleep, and rem sleep was completely abolished. in the first 2 hr of recovery sleep, nrem sleep duration was significantly increased relative to baseline , while rem sleep and total sleep amounts did not change . swa during the first hour of recovery sleep was increased relative to baseline levels in both the frontal  and parietal cortices . thus, we conclude that sleep patterns and mechanisms of sleep regulation in aldh1l <dig> – egfp-l10a mice are normal.

trap enriches for astrocytic-specific genes
three groups of mice were used in the trap study : awake mice  were collected during the dark phase  at the end of a long period of wake , and after spending at least 70 % of the previous 6–7 hr awake. sleeping mice  were collected during the light period , at the end of a long period of sleep , and after spending at least 75 % of the previous 6–7 hr asleep. sleep-deprived mice  were spontaneously awake during most of the dark phase and then kept awake during the first 4 hr of the light period by exposure to novel objects and by tapping on the cage when slow waves appeared on the eeg.

we checked whether trap accurately enriched for astrocytic-specific genes using two approaches. first, we randomly selected six astrocytic immunoprecipitated samples  and six unbound samples  from the s, w and sd groups  and performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction  for the genes coding for the astrocytic marker gfap, the neuronal marker syt <dig> and the oligodendrocyte marker mbp. in all mice, gfap expression was markedly higher in the ip sample relative to the ub sample, while the opposite was true for mbp and syt <dig> . we then used the trap microarray data to calculate the ip/ub ratio for genes previously identified as enriched in astrocytes, neurons, mature oligodendrocytes , oligodendrocyte precursor cells , microglia, endothelial cells or pericytes  <cit> . astrocytic-specific genes were highly expressed in all ip samples, whereas the large majority of genes specific for neurons, mos, opcs, microglia, endothelial cells or pericytes were enriched in all ub samples . thus, we can confirm that trap consistently enriched for astrocytic-specific genes in all experimental groups. in addition, in the ip samples we measured the expression of several genes involved in pathways known to be important for astrocytic functions  <cit> . expression levels of several of these genes were affected by behavioral state . this was the case for gjb <dig>  ppp1r3c, and adcy <dig>  which were upregulated in both w and sd relative to s. other genes, such as slc1a <dig> and p2ry <dig>  increased their expression only in sd, while p2ry <dig> showed higher expression in s than sd. to test whether changes observed at the transcription level were followed by changes at the protein level, we considered the list of all astrocytic-specific genes that were differentially expressed across behavioral states, and whose corresponding protein was reported to be exclusively expressed in astrocytes. from this list, we selected gjb <dig> and slc1a <dig>  which code, respectively, for the gap-junction subunit connexin <dig>  and for the glutamate transporter glast, two well-characterized astrocytic proteins. both genes showed increased mrna levels in sd relative to s . western blotting experiments using cerebral cortex homogenates of s  and sd  mice found that the expression of both cx- <dig> and glast was also increased in sd relative to s .fig.  <dig> enrichment analysis of aldh1l <dig> – egfp-l10a ip samples. a qpcr expression  of the cell-specific marker for astrocytes  is consistently enriched in the ip rna across all groups , whereas the negative controls  are consistently enriched in the ub samples. b histograms showing ip/ub ratios expressed in log <dig> fold change for s, w and sd samples. in all three experimental groups, the genes identified by  <cit>  as specific for astrocytes  are enriched in ip samples, whereas the genes specific for neurons , mature oligodendrocytes , oligodendrocyte precursor cells , microglia , endothelial cells  and pericytes  are enriched in s, w and sd ub samples. c heat diagram  showing the expression intensities of several common astrocytic genes in each individual s, w and sd mouse. arrows indicate gjb <dig> and slc1a <dig>  the two astrocytic genes selected for western blot analysis : cx- <dig> , p =  <dig> ), glast  in sd  relative to s . representative bands from s and sd pools  are depicted above each bar for cx- <dig> and glast



astrocytic genes are affected by sleep and wake independent of time of day
we compared astrocytic ip samples  from s, w and sd mice  to identify the specific effects of sleep and wake on astrocytic gene expression. to be included in the analysis, probesets needed to be called “present” in at least one sample, which was the case for ~74 % of all probesets . all these  <dig>  probesets were analyzed, whether or not they were enriched in ip samples relative to ub samples. this is because our primary goal was to identify sleep/wake-dependent genes expressed in astrocytes, independent of whether they were overrepresented in this cell type relative to neurons or oligodendrocytes.

first, we compared ip samples collected at 3 am  with ip samples collected at 3 pm  and found that  <dig> probesets, representing  <dig> unique genes, were differentially expressed . thus, the expression levels of ~ <dig>  % of astrocytic genes changed due to time of day, independently of behavioral state . next, we compared ip samples collected after sleep with ip samples collected after spontaneous wake and sleep deprivation, and found that  <dig> probesets, representing  <dig> unique genes , changed their expression because of behavioral state independently of time of day . as in previous work  <cit> , we considered “sleep” genes to be only those that were upregulated in the sleep group  relative to both the spontaneous wake group , and the forced wake group , whereas “wake” genes were those with higher expression in both spontaneous wake and sleep deprivation groups than in the sleep group. since spontaneous wake occurred at night and sleep deprivation during the day, sleep and wake genes as defined here reflect changes due to behavioral state rather than circadian factors or exposure to light.

the vast majority of genes  that changed their expression because of behavioral state were wake genes, while only  <dig> genes  were sleep genes. a statistical approach using gene annotation enrichment analysis  was carried out, together with an extensive analysis of the literature, to elucidate the biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components associated with sleep and wake in astrocytes . despite the short list of sleep genes, we found enrichment of genes involved in cell development and proliferation  and biosynthesis . other sleep genes included slc16a <dig>  which codes for the mct <dig> transporter involved in the astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle  <cit>  and whose activity in the hippocampus is essential for long-term memory formation  <cit> . by contrast, the functional categories enriched during wake included cell metabolism , nucleotide binding , anatomical structure development , endocytosis , and ion binding . overall, a large category of astrocytic genes modulated by behavioral state was related to the extracellular matrix and/or the cytoskeleton, including sleep genes arap <dig> , collagen type iv alpha  <dig> , ceacam <dig>  the actinin-associated lim protein pdlim <dig>  and actin gamma . wake genes included trio, gem and synj <dig>  all of which have been involved in cytoskeleton modifications and the elongation of astrocytic processes, as well as genes coding for integrins  and other extracellular matrix proteins , the mannose receptor c <dig> that binds and internalizes collagen , the proteoglycan syndecan  <dig> , the endoglycosidase heparanase , and others .fig.  <dig> functional characterization of genes differentially expressed in sleep  and wake . top: heat diagrams show the probeset intensity for each individual animal in the three experimental conditions. bottom: functional annotation analysis  for s  and w + sd  genes. the top eight functional annotation clusters in order of enrichment score are shown for s  and w + sd 



as discussed before, we applied a conservative criterion to define wake genes, considering only those upregulated in both spontaneous wake and forced wake. when the two wake conditions were compared to each other, we found  <dig> differentially expressed unique genes, including  <dig> upregulated in w and  <dig> upregulated in sd . the number of differentially expressed genes was two- to threefold higher when s was compared to either w or sd:  <dig> genes in s vs w  and  <dig> in s vs sd . this suggests that w and sd are more similar to each other than either wake condition to sleep. the biological processes most enriched in w and sd were cell adhesion and metabolism, respectively , but the interpretation of these differences is not straightforward, because w and sd differ by many factors, including “quality” of wake , duration of wake , presence or absence of light, and time of day . of note, most genes differentially expressed between w and sd also differed between s and sd , indicating that their expression reflects the duration of wake and/or the specific presence of forced wake. only a minority  of genes instead differed between w and sd but not in other comparisons , including  <dig> genes known to be upregulated in sd and  <dig> upregulated in w. these could be “light” genes, responding to the presence or absence of light, respectively .

ultrastructural studies
astrocytic coverage of cortical dendritic spines increases after extended wake
astrocytes are plastic cells. they are capable of expanding their fine peripheral astrocytic processes  in close proximity to synapses in response to increased synaptic activity  <cit> . in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that these plastic events can take place in a few hours and have functional consequences for synapses  <cit> . our microarray results suggested that astrocytic pathways involved in cytoskeleton modification and elongation of paps were modulated by sleep and wake. to test this hypothesis directly, we used sbf-sem to study pap dynamics in relation to changes in behavioral state. specifically, we focused on the interaction between paps and dendritic spines in layer ii of the prefrontal cortex, because supragranular layers are highly plastic  <cit>  and the swa of nrem sleep, which reflects the need for sleep and its depth, is largest in frontal areas  <cit> . the great majority  of cortical spines are associated with excitatory synapses  <cit> . we focused on dendritic branches of similar size  and within each segmented portion of the dendrite all spines were analyzed . the dataset included  <dig> spines from a sleep group ,  <dig> spines from an acute sleep deprivation group , and  <dig> spines from a chronic sleep restriction group . for each spine, the spine head, the axon–spine interface , i.e. the interfacing surface between the axonal bouton and the spine head, and the paps were manually segmented and reconstructed in 3d .fig.  <dig> astrocytic coverage of cortical synapses increases after csr. a–d examples of electron microscope images showing pap−  and pap+  spines, with their relative 3d reconstructions . in  and , paps are depicted in light blue and spine heads  are in yellow. b = presynaptic bouton; a = axon; d = dendrite. the asi is traced in red and the apposed astrocytic surface on the spine head is in green. scale bar = 250 nm. in , the pap embracing the spine  has been made transparent to allow a view of the spine head underneath. note that the apposed astrocytic surface  contacts the asi  on one side. e percentage of pap− and pap+ spines per dendrite in layer ii cortical fields for s , sd  and csr . pap−, kruskal–wallis, p =  <dig> ; pap+, kruskal–wallis, p =  <dig> . f correlation between area of the apposed astrocytic surface and spine head volume in s , sd  and csr . g apposed astrocytic surface area in s , sd  and csr . sd vs csr, mann-whitney , *p <  <dig> ; s vs csr, mw, *p <  <dig> . h apposed astrocytic surface area to spine head surface area ratio in s , sd  and csr . sd vs csr, mw, *p =  <dig> , s vs csr, mw, *p =  <dig> . i apposed astrocytic surface area to spine head surface area ratio for spines with small , medium  and large  spine head volume in s , sd  and csr . note that csr showed higher ratios than s and sd for medium  and large spines . j example of spine head including the spine apparatus . pap indicates the astrocytic process, s the spine head and b the presynaptic bouton. scale bar = 300 nm. k apposed astrocytic surface area to spine head surface area ratio for spines with and without the spine apparatus in s , sd  and csr . note that csr showed higher ratios than s and sd for spines with spine apparatus . all values are mean ± standard deviation



first, we classified spines depending on whether or not they were reached by paps. pap positive  spines were defined as those contacted by paps in any location of the spine head, independent of the presence of paps contacting the spine neck and/or the axonal bouton. across all animals, ~81 % of spines were pap+ and ~19 % were pap negative  , consistent with findings in layer iv of the mouse barrel cortex, where only ~10 % of spines lack astrocytic contact  <cit> . compared to pap+ spines, pap− spines had smaller mean head volume  and smaller mean asi . between-group analysis showed that the number of pap+ and pap– spines did not differ across groups .

next, for pap+ spines, we calculated the astrocytic coverage, i.e. the extent of the astrocytic surface apposed to the spine head. in all three groups, we found a positive correlation between spine head volume and apposed astrocytic surface . thus, not only larger spines are more likely to be contacted by astrocytes, but the extent of this contact also increases with spine size. crucially, we also found that the apposed astrocytic surface differed across groups , being higher in csr relative to both s  and sd . we also calculated the ratio between apposed astrocytic surface and the whole spine head surface, and found that this parameter differed across the three groups , again with csr having higher values than both s  and sd .

we further assessed whether the increased astrocytic coverage observed in csr was limited to spines with a specific size by subdividing spine heads into three subgroups: small , medium  and large spines . the increase in apposed astrocytic surface in csr was significant in medium  and large spines . finally, previous work has shown that large mature spines usually contain the spine apparatus, an organelle composed of stacked smooth endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . we tested whether the increased coverage observed in csr mice applied specifically to spines with the spine apparatus, and found that this was the case .

wake brings astrocytic processes closer to the synaptic cleft
astrocytes can contact spine heads in two different ways, depending on whether or not the contact includes the area around the synaptic cleft . thus, we subdivided pap+ spines in two subgroups, pap+asi– and pap+asi+, which accounted for ~25 % and ~75 % of all pap+ spines, respectively, and tested whether their number was affected by sleep and wake. we found that this was the case . specifically, the proportion of pap+asi+ spines was higher in sd  and csr  than in s, while the opposite was true for pap+asi– . of note, in all groups large spines were approached by paps at the asi level more frequently than small spines . to rule out that the observed pap changes were unique to conditions of forced wake, such as sd and csr, we also studied mice sacrificed after at least 6 hr of spontaneous wake . the proportion of pap+asi+ spines in w was significantly higher than s , and comparable to sd  and csr , indicating that the movement of paps toward the synaptic cleft is not caused by the stress of sleep deprivation.fig.  <dig> wake brings astrocytic processes closer to the synaptic cleft. a–d examples of electron microscope images showing pap+asi–  and pap+asi+  spines, with their relative tridimensional reconstructions . paps are depicted in light blue and spine heads  are in yellow. b = presynaptic bouton, a = axon, d = dendrite. the asi is traced in red and the apposed astrocytic surface on the spine head is in green. scale bar = 250 nm. in , the pap embracing the spine  has been made transparent to allow a view of the spine head underneath. note that the apposed astrocytic surface  does not reach the asi . in , the orientation of the structure shows the contact between the apposed astrocytic surface  and the asi. the line drawing on the right shows the asi perimeter  and the astrocytic perimeter  in 3d. e percentage of pap+asi– and pap+asi+ spines per dendrite in layer ii cortical fields for s , sd  and csr . pap+asi–, s vs sd, mw, * p =  <dig> ; s vs csr, mw, *p =  <dig> ; pap+asi+, s vs sd, mw, * p =  <dig> ; s vs csr, mw, *p =  <dig> . f astrocytic perimeter in s , sd  and csr . sd vs csr, mw, *p =  <dig> ; s vs csr, mw, *p <  <dig> . g astrocytic perimeter to asi perimeter ratio in s , sd  and csr . sd vs csr, mw, *p =  <dig> ; s vs csr, mw, *p =  <dig> . h, i example of portion of neuropil occupied by pap  and its relative 3d reconstruction. scale bar = 300 nm. j pap surface-to-volume ratio in s , sd  and csr . all values are mean ± standard deviation



next, we measured whether the extent of the astrocytic coverage at the level of the synaptic cleft also increased with wake. we calculated the portion of asi perimeter that was contacted by pap  and the ratio between the astrocytic perimeter and the whole asi perimeter . both parameters increased in csr relative to both s  and sd . furthermore, since in all groups we found a positive correlation between astrocytic perimeter and asi , and the size of the asi is positively correlated with the spine head volume , we subdivided the spines depending on head size or presence of a spine apparatus, as done before. the ratio between astrocytic perimeter and asi perimeter increased significantly in csr compared to s in spines of the largest size , as well as in spines with a spine apparatus , although csr showed a trend to be higher relative to both s and sd also in spines without spine apparatus . the ratio between astrocytic perimeter and asi perimeter also increased in csr relative to sd in small spines . overall, the csr changes at the synaptic interface are consistent with those seen at the level of the entire spine head, with the most significant increases in astrocytic coverage occurring in large spines with the spine apparatus.

finally, we tested whether the increased extension of the astrocytic coverage in csr may result from an overall enlargement of the astrocytic profiles in the neuropil. we measured the pap volume in a portion of neuropil surrounding every spine considered in the previous analysis . the volume occupied by paps did not change across experimental groups, although an increasing trend in csr was noticeable . however, the pap surface-to-volume ratio was significantly higher in csr than s  and sd . since the pap volume is slightly increased in csr relative to s and sd, an increase of the pap surface-to-volume ratio can be explained only by an increase of the astrocytic surface. thus, extended periods of wake have little effect on pap volume, but increase the pap surface in the neuropil.

discussion
we recently found that  <dig>  % of the genes expressed in oligodendrocytes are modulated by behavioral state, with similar numbers of wake and sleep genes being modulated   <cit> . the number of state-dependent genes is smaller in astrocytes , and more than sevenfold higher in wake than in sleep . the  <dig> mice used in the current study were processed in two independent experiments, and in both cases, the results showed a strong bias towards wake genes. thus, the imbalance in the number of sleep and wake genes is likely not dependent on technical issues, and may reflect the fact that wake is a highly active state for astrocytes, as suggested also by the enrichment of wake genes related to energy metabolism. a case in point is adcy <dig>  the gene coding for soluble adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that stimulates glycogen breakdown and the release of lactate in response to neuronal depolarization  <cit> . the expression of the gene for protein targeting to glycogen  also increased with wake, consistent with previous studies that used cell sorting followed by qpcr to measure a few astrocytic genes in a subset of cortical astrocytes   <cit> . these studies also found a small wake-related upregulation of slc2a <dig>  which codes for the glucose transporter glut- <dig>  and slc1a <dig>  which encodes the major glutamate transporter . these genes were not upregulated during wake in our study, most likely because microarrays are not as sensitive as qpcr, although we observed a significant increase of slc1a <dig>  which codes for the second glial glutamate transporter , in sleep deprivation relative to sleep.

among the sleep genes, we found significant enrichment for a few functional categories including development and cell proliferation. the same categories are enriched during sleep in oligodendrocytes, and the rate of proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursors doubles in sleep relative to wake  <cit> . cirp, coding for cold inducible rna binding protein, is also upregulated by sleep in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes  <cit> , and was identified as a sleep gene in previous studies that pooled transcripts from all brain cells . cirp is required for high-amplitude circadian gene expression in fibroblasts, but daily oscillations in cirp mrna levels are driven by changes in temperature, not by the circadian clock  <cit> . cirp binds to the untranslated regions of hundreds of transcripts, including many that promote protein synthesis and cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis  <cit> . thus, cirp induction may be one of the mechanisms by which sleep favors cell proliferation and biosynthetic processes. another sleep gene codes for the ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme  <dig> . in human cells, uba <dig> mediates the repair of dna double-strand breaks  caused by metabolic stress or other insults  <cit> . we recently found that the number of dsbs increases in cortical neurons after a few hours of exploration, confirming previous evidence  <cit> . we also found that once induced, dsbs decline when exploratory behavior is followed by sleep but not when it is followed by forced wake . however, we currently do not know whether wake-related dsbs also occur in astrocytes, and whether their repair depends on astrocytic uba <dig> induction.

many genes coding for components of the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, including integrins, collagen and syndecan, were modulated by sleep or wake. these genes included trio, synj <dig> and gem, whose upregulation during wake suggested that astrocytic pathways involved in pap elongation are promoted by wake. trio codes for a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor involved in the activation of the rac pathway  <cit> , and activation of rac <dig>  a ras-related gtp-binding protein, is essential for promoting pap elongation via actin reorganization  <cit> . synj <dig> codes for synaptojanin  <dig>  a phosphoinositide phosphatase that mediates rac1-regulated functions and promotes the formation of astrocytic lamellipodia  <cit> . finally, gem codes for a gtp-binding protein that interacts with ezrin, a cytoskeleton linker that has an actin-binding site and contributes to the formation of specialized structures of the plasma membranes  <cit> . ezrin is specifically expressed in astrocytes and it is essential for the structural plasticity of paps  <cit> .

using sbf-sem, we found that independent of behavioral state, a stable number of spines in layer ii of the mouse prefrontal cortex lack astrocytic coverage. these “bald” spines represent a minority of all cortical spines  and are of small size, and thus may not require perisynaptic astrocytes because they are presumably newly formed and/or less active. on the other hand, the head of most spines is contacted by astrocytes. these spines are of medium or large size and thus presumably more active and in need of active mechanisms for the clearance of glutamate and k+ ions. indeed, previous work showed that paps preferentially target large synapses  <cit>  and astrocytic coverage of the spine head correlates with spine size  <cit> . even short periods of wake are sufficient to bring astrocytic processes closer to the synaptic cleft, possibly because wake active synapses are in greater need of the housekeeping functions mediated by astrocytes. in line with this hypothesis, overall firing rates in the cortex are higher in wake than in sleep  <cit> , and extracellular levels of glutamate increase during wake and decline during sleep  <cit> . on the other hand, pap retraction from the synaptic cleft during sleep might favor glutamate spillover and cross-talk with neighboring synapses  <cit> , thereby contributing to the synchronization of neuronal activity typical of nrem sleep.

csr not only moves astrocytic processes towards the synaptic cleft but also increases overall astrocytic coverage, including the asi. in the visual cortex, astrocytic coverage in direct apposition to pre- and postsynaptic elements increases with chronic exposure to a complex environment  <cit> . in the barrel cortex, whisker stimulation for 24 hr leads to an increase in the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on spines, in the number of cortical spines contacted by astrocytes and in the astrocytic coverage at the asi  <cit> . an increase in perisynaptic coverage also occurs in the hippocampus after induction of long-term potentiation  <cit>  and after kindling  <cit> . of note, in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that sensory stimulation and ltp-inducing stimuli  may first displace astrocytic processes away from spines, and then lead to an increase in astrocytic coverage and spine stability 24 hr later  <cit> . ongoing experiments are testing whether the expansion of perisynaptic astrocytes after sustained wake results from sustained neuronal activity, and/or is secondary to an overall increase in the number and/or size of synapses. interestingly, acrobatic training increases both the number of synapses and glial volume in the cerebellum, while forced exercise induces angiogenesis but not additional glia  <cit> . this suggests that glial hypertrophy, presumably mainly of astrocytes, may reflect learning-related synaptogenesis and not simply increases in synaptic activity  <cit> .

in addition to increased synaptic coverage, csr is associated with an augmented astrocytic surface in the neuropil. given their lamellar morphology, astrocytic processes account for most of the cell surface area, even if they contain a small portion of the cytoplasmatic volume. this remarkably large surface-to-volume ratio  <cit>  provides astrocytes with ample space for positioning a large number of ion channels, ligand receptors and uptake transporters that are necessary to sustain glia–neuron interactions  <cit> . therefore, the increase in astrocytic surface after csr may represent the astrocytic reaction to the sustained neuronal activity characterizing extended periods of wake.

it was recently found that the extracellular space enlarges significantly, by ~60 %, in conditions of synchronized cortical activity such as slow-wave sleep and anesthesia  <cit> . this effect was to a large extent dependent on the locus coeruleus  <cit>  and could be mediated, at least in part, by astrocytes  <cit> . our findings are compatible with this hypothesis, because we found that astrocytic processes are closer to synapses in wake than in sleep. however, it is difficult to relate the two studies directly, because the extracellular space is significantly reduced in electron microscopy samples that underwent chemical fixation and dehydration, such as ours. on the other hand, our finding that behavioral states affect the pap surface-to-volume ratio suggests that during sleep, astrocytic processes may assume a more rounded and less complicated shape, which may promote the exchange of molecules in the extracellular space and their washout through the glymphatic pathway  <cit> .

the mechanisms underlying the sleep/wake effects on astrocytic processes are likely to be complex, because the activity of cortical glutamatergic neurons, as well as that of arousal systems, including the noradrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and orexinergic systems, are higher in wake than in sleep  <cit> . astrocytes from different brain regions may respond to different combinations of neurotransmitters  <cit> . in vivo calcium imaging experiments show that locomotion, sensory stimulation and the startle response trigger widespread coordinated increases in astrocytic activity in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and that the locus coeruleus, but not the cholinergic system, plays a major role in these responses via activation of α <dig> adrenoceptors . the locus coeruleus may therefore provide a major activating signal to astrocytes during wake in the cortex, while the cholinergic system may have a prominent role in the hippocampus  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we show that sleep upregulates select genes, like cirp and uba <dig>  whereas wake upregulates many genes related to metabolism, the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton. using sbf-sem, we find that short wake brings astrocytic processes closer to the synaptic cleft, while csr also extends the overall astrocytic coverage of the synapse and increases the available astrocytic surface in the neuropil. wake-related changes likely reflect an increased need for glutamate clearance, and are consistent with an overall increase in synaptic strength when sleep is prevented. the reduced astrocytic coverage during sleep, instead, may favor glutamate spillover, thus promoting neuronal synchronization during nrem sleep.
