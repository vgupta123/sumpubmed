BACKGROUND
demographic instability influences the distribution of genetic diversity within and among discrete colonies of a widely distributed species  <cit> . local extinction and colonization events are expected to reduce the overall effective size of a metapopulation thereby limiting its capacity to retain genetic variation  <cit> . furthermore, genetic drift contributes significantly less to geographical differentiation if the average persistence time of colonies is less than the time it takes to fix neutral alleles  <cit> . the number of colonists, their sources , and ongoing rates of gene flow all affect the degree to which demographic instability affects geographical differentiation  <cit> . yet, these parameters are rarely known; instead they are commonly inferred from statistical analyses of genealogical variation that is assumed to be selectively neutral  <cit> . for a variety of practical reasons, recent studies have relied mostly on information from mitochondrial dna variation, although the assumption of selective neutrality has been debated  <cit> . independent genealogies involving nuclear genes are needed to distinguish the effects of idiosyncratic processes such as mitochondrial selective sweeps from demographic processes that leave genome-wide signatures  <cit> .

the communities of marine animals that occupy deep-sea hydrothermal vents provide unusual opportunities to study dynamic metapopulation processes  <cit> . vent communities are supported by chemosynthetic bacteria that oxidize volcanic gases  concentrated in the hydrothermal effluents. adults of the iconic tubeworm riftia pachyptila , for example, are nourished entirely by sulfur-oxidizing endosymbiotic bacteria, linking their lives to the tempo of disturbances that create and destroy their habitats . eastern pacific vents  that host r. pachyptila are particularly ephemeral, persisting for a few years to several decades before fluid conduits are blocked, magma supplies shift, or lava flows extirpate local communities  <cit> . earthquakes can open fluid conduits, re-activating old vents, and magmatic eruptions spawn new vents  <cit> . studies of vent community succession  <cit>  revealed that r. pachyptila is among the first species to colonize a new vent once suitable conditions are established. within two years its numbers can grow to several thousand adult individuals, but changes in vent flow, or overgrowth by mytilids can lead to its replacement as the dominant species -- a process that can take months to years depending on the location. the frequency of habitat turnover varies with tectonic spreading rates  <cit> . tectonic spreading at eastern pacific vents  varies from moderate rates  along the galápagos rift  to fast rates  along the northern east pacific rise  and superfast rates  along the southern epr . cycles of habitat disturbance associated with these events are expected to favor organisms with rapid individual growth rates, early reproduction, and effective dispersal capabilities  <cit> .

active vents along the epr and gar are restricted to axial grabens  that are expected to function as dispersal corridors for the larvae of species like r. pachyptila  <cit> . the distances between active vents vary from a few kilometers along a ridge segment to 100s of kilometers between contiguous segments . a one-dimensional stepping-stone model  <cit>  provides a reasonable starting hypothesis for connectivity among linear habitats such as these, but population genetic studies provide limited support for this configuration, partly due to under-sampling of populations and insufficiently polymorphic genetic markers  <cit> . however, r. pachyptila was first among the few species that exhibited evidence for stepping-stone dispersal  <cit> . estimates of gene flow , inferred from pairwise fst's for allozyme differentiation, declined with geographical distances among nepr and gar populations. based on larval durations and predominant currents along the nepr, r. pachyptila is expected to have mean larval dispersal distances of  <dig> to  <dig> km  <cit> . a subsequent phylogeographic survey examined additional samples from the sepr axis, but found no evidence for stepping-stone dispersal due to a near absence of sequence variation in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i,   <cit> . a number of co-distributed species of annelids and mollusks have been similarly examined, and they all exhibit substantial coi variation  <cit> . their mitochondrial haplotype diversities range from a minimum of  <dig>  in r. pachyptila to a maximum of  <dig>  in another annelid, with a mean of  <dig>  across  <dig> species . examinations of nuclear allozymes, aflps and dna microsatellites from limited portions of r. pachyptila's range  <cit>  suggests that its low coi variation may be anomalous, resulting perhaps from a mitochondrial selective sweep. nevertheless, allozymes, aflps and microsatellites exhibit mutation rates that do not compare to mitochondrial dna sequences, and they might experience different selective constraints. a study including nuclear dna sequences with sufficient numbers of individuals sampled from r. pachyptila's known geographic range has yet to be performed.

testing selective sweep versus population bottleneck hypotheses requires an examination of multiple independent genetic markers  <cit> . to that end, we examined dna sequences from three independent nuclear loci and another mitochondrial locus, cytochrome b , from r. pachyptila. samples were collected from known vents along the gar, nepr and sepr axes . first, we tested the selective sweep hypothesis by assessing whether mitochondrial diversity within and among populations is idiosyncratically low. second, we examined whether population structure is consistent with a linear stepping stone model, or if more complex models of subdivision are justified. finally, we assessed whether demographic instability associated with tectonic spreading is correlated with reduced levels of genetic diversity.

methods
samples
expeditions conducted between  <dig> and  <dig> explored and sampled hydrothermal vents at  <dig> locations along the nepr, sepr and gar axes . the samples examined in this study were obtained from nine locations . worms were harvested with robotic manipulators on the human occupied vehicle  alvin  or the remotely operated vehicle  tiburon . samples were placed in an insulated container with ambient seawater. upon recovery at the surface, whole worms were stored in 2°c filtered seawater prior to tissue sampling. a small sample of vestimentum, a tissue that is normally devoid of endosymbiotic bacteria, was frozen at -70°c or preserved in 95% etoh.

dna purification, pcr conditions and dna sequencing
genomic dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy kit, following manufacturer's protocols . the primers, optimal annealing temperatures, and pcr conditions are available in additional file  <dig>  we used two pcr programs:  initial denaturation temperature of 94°c for  <dig> min followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> min, 55°c for  <dig> min and 72°c for  <dig> min with a single final extension of 72°c for  <dig> min; and  initial denaturation temperature of 94°c for  <dig> min followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> min, 48°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig>  min, and final extension of 72°c for  <dig> min. pcr products from all loci were purified by gel excision and cleaned with montage filter units  or diluted in  <dig> μl sterile water and purified with multiscreen hts pcr  <dig> vacuum manifold system . unless noted , dna sequencing employed the same pcr primers. purified pcr products were sequenced bidirectionally on an abi  <dig> capillary sequencer using bigdye terminator chemistry . protein-coding sequences were checked for stop codons.

mitochondrial sequences
pcr mixtures for cytb included  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig> μm of each dntp,  <dig>  units of taq polymerase , 1x pcr buffer , and  <dig> μl of dna template in a final volume of  <dig> μl. cytb sequences were amplified with previously published primer pairs  <cit>  and pcr program-i . the  <dig> bp amplified portion of cytb corresponds to positions 10732- <dig> in the r. pachyptila mitochondrial genome .

single-copy nuclear  dnas
one of us  previously generated a series of anonymous scndna sequences from r. pachyptila . we designed primers from these sequences following karl et al. . briefly, purified total dna from a single r. pachyptila individual from the gar was digested with the restriction enzyme sau3a. fragments were sorted by size, cloned, and screened to determine genomic copy number. to design primers, we sequenced each end of the low copy clone-inserts. nine clone-inserts were tested for their potential utility in population screening. seven inserts generated products that could not be used because they included length variation  that confounded our scoring of individual genotypes, or they lacked sufficient polymorphism. the rpt <dig>  primers amplified predictable products, but internal primers were required for rpt <dig>  to improve its sequence quality . pcr program-i was used for both loci. amplification with the rpt <dig>  primers generated two products; the larger band was used as template for sequencing. after preliminary sequencing, many genotypes contained two polymorphic sites. to resolve the ambiguous haplotypes, we cloned the pcr products from heterozygous individuals using the standard manufacturer's protocol .

nuclear intron
of seven primer pairs developed by jarman et al.  <cit> , only the atpsα primers amplified a polymorphic product that could be scored in r. pachyptila. to improve its reliability, we designed non-degenerate internal primers . the intron amplified using the same pcr recipe as above and pcr program-ii. initial screening of the  <dig> bp product from ten individuals from nine populations revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism  at position  <dig> of the amplicon. because the snp could be recognized by the restriction enzyme nspi, population screening was based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms . ten μl of the amplicons were suspended in a cocktail containing  <dig> × ne buffer- <dig>   <dig> μg/μl bovine serum albumen,  <dig> units of nspi  and sterile water to a final volume of  <dig> μl, and the mix was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> - <dig> hours. products were separated on 3% agarose gels at room temperature for  <dig> - <dig> hrs at 65- <dig> volts. positive controls of known genotypes  were included with rflp digestions and all gel analyses.

statistical analyses
we used the program phase v.  <dig>   <cit>  to reconstruct allelic haplotypes for nuclear loci using the cloned haplotypes from the double heterozygotes as a baseline. we also used the software to estimate background recombination rates per gene segment. recombination rates were low enough to assume no effective recombination within each segment. tcs v.  <dig>   <cit>  was used to construct statistical parsimony networks for each locus. arlequin  <dig>   <cit>  was also used to estimate molecular diversity, θs  <cit> , from the number of segregating sites, and fu's fs  <cit> , and to estimate gene diversity , adjusted for sample size according to eq.  <dig>  of nei  <cit> . allelic richness  estimates were obtained by the rarefaction methods implemented in hp-rare v.  <dig>   <cit> . estimates of fis and tests for hardy weinberg equilibrium  and linkage disequilibrium  were conducted with genepop v.  <dig>   <cit> .

the multi-locus genotypic assignment method employed in structure v.  <dig>   <cit>  was used to estimate the probable number of discrete population clusters  represented by the data. we assumed correlated allele frequencies between population samples and admixed ancestries of populations. parameter estimates for correlated allele frequencies and admixture were estimated by averaging values from preliminary simulations that varied k from  <dig> to  <dig>  simulations were repeated at least five times for each value of k  and for two disparate values of λ , a shape distribution parameter for allele frequencies, based on initial simulations. assuming a uniform prior on k, we estimated a bayes factor for each value of k after averaging the ln pr values between simulations. all simulations employed a burn-in value of  <dig> with  <dig> subsequent steps in the markov chain monte carlo  sampling process.

to assess evidence for isolation-by distance  we used arlequin  <dig>  to obtain pairwise estimates of fst, and the geodistances procedure in le progiciel r  <cit>  to estimate great arc distances from geographical coordinates for the sample locations . the mantel test module implemented in arlequin  <dig>  was used to assess correlations between the genetic  and geographical  distance matrices. to assess possible affects of subdivision, we generated an assignment matrix  with values that equaled zero  if populations belonged to a cluster identified by structure and one  if populations belonged to different clusters. the partial correlation  of a and b after accounting for c was obtained according to the methods of smouse et al.  <cit>  as implemented in arlequin  <dig> .

the fst-outlier method  <cit>  implemented in the program lositan  <cit>  was used to test for evidence of selection. the program uses empirical estimates of genic heterozygosity to simulate neutral expectations for fst under an island model of migration. an iterative bisection algorithm is used to simulate data with a mean fst that matches the empirical data, even when the data do not strictly adhere to island model assumptions  for neutral genes  <cit> . initial simulations were conducted with  <dig>  replications, assuming an infinite allele mutation model. we then conducted simulations with  <dig>  replications and used the neutral mean for fst to estimate its 95% confidence intervals . empirical values were compared to this distribution and those significantly above or below the 95% cis might be influenced by selection. we attempted to use the program sweep_bott  <cit>  to distinguish population bottlenecks from a selective sweeps, but the simple star phylogenies obtained for the present genes prevented its execution.

geographical and geophysical methods
seafloor spreading rates  were estimated by the nuvel-1a model implemented in the web-based calculator <http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~menke/plates <dig> html>. this kinematic plate-motion model uses tables of euler vectors previously estimated from geomagnetic reversals  <cit> . space-based geodetic methods were used to improve accuracy of the model  <cit> . the nuvel-1a estimates of spreading rates are highly correlated  with empirical measurements based on near-bottom surveys and space geodesy methods  <cit> .

RESULTS
distribution and abundance
we explored  <dig> active vent fields between 27°n and 38°s latitude and obtained adequate samples of r. pachyptila from eight localities . robust populations were observed and sampled from the nepr localities. northern sepr localities s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> also host robust r. pachyptila populations, but only one specimen was observed and sampled from s <dig> on the nw flank of the easter microplate. nine worms were observed and sampled from s <dig> during four dives in  <dig>  and none were found when we returned there in  <dig>  we conducted five submersible dives at s <dig> and found a single individual living deeply within a recess on the vertical wall of an active chimney, but it could not be sampled before deteriorating weather conditions forced us to abandon this location.

polymorphism
twenty-five alleles were identified across four polymorphic loci . sequences associated with these alleles were deposited with genbank . for each locus, parsimony analyses produced very simple star-like genealogies with mostly one-step mutational differences from a primary  allele . widely distributed secondary  alleles occurred at three loci. the assignments of haplotype phases in double heterozygotes were resolved with 97% probability for rpt <dig>   and 89-96% probability for rpt <dig>   depending on the sample location. haplotypes inferred with the program phase were used in all subsequent analyses. sequence diversity was very low in the samples for all four loci, with π values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and θs values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  .

genotypic frequencies at the nuclear loci revealed no evidence for deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium . multi-locus tests obtained by summing p-values for each locus  provided no indication of significant heterozygote deficiencies within population samples . furthermore, the grand total of these values obtained by summing across all loci and samples was not significant . tests for linkage disequilibrium between pairs of polymorphic nuclear loci provided no evidence for associations within populations . furthermore no associations existed when p-values from the pairwise comparisons were summed across populations . similarly, tests for cytonuclear disequilibrium involving cytb and the three nuclear genes were non-significant within populations  and globally across populations .

test of selection
because overall differentiation, as estimated by fst, varied among the four loci , we used lositan to test for evidence of natural selection. first, we determined the neutral expectation, fst =  <dig> , for the nuclear loci alone. though all the observed fst values were higher than the neutral mean, none fell outside of the 95% cis. assuming an even sex ratio and strictly maternal cytoplasmic inheritance, the neutral expectation for a mitochondrial gene is fst = 4fst/)  <cit> . the fst =  <dig>  for cytb was only slightly greater than its neutral expectation ; thus, no evidence existed for directional or balancing selection having shaped geographical differentiation for these genetic markers.

geographical structure
we used structure to estimate the number of population clusters  represented among  <dig> multilocus genotypes. for each combination of priors, k =  <dig> provided the greatest mean value for ln pr. bayes factors were  <dig>  for k =  <dig> and zero for k =  <dig> and k =  <dig>  we estimated q, the probability of assignment of genotypes to the northern cluster , and represented the mean of q for each sample in figure 1e. the means exhibited a clinal pattern between n <dig> and gar, and are effectively homogeneous along the sepr axis. a single individual sampled from s <dig> clustered with its neighboring samples. hierarchical amova of the eight population samples partitioned  <dig> % of gene diversity between the northern and southern clusters,  <dig> % within clusters, and  <dig> % within samples.

evidence also existed for isolation-by-distance, ibd . pairwise fst's  increased significantly with geographical distances ; however, the comparisons between northern and southern clusters greatly influenced this relationship . an ibd relationship remained after exclusion of sepr samples from the analysis , but the correlation was not significant. to better assess how associations with the northern and southern clusters  affected the relationship between fst  and distance , we estimated the partial correlation of a on b after accounting for c. a marginally significant relationship remained . it should be noted that the trans-equatorial fst between n <dig> and s <dig>  is smaller than the fst's between adjacent pairs of nepr populations . this trans-equatorial fst also is smaller than fst's between other population pairs that are about ~ <dig> km apart  .

bold values are statistically significant at the α =  <dig> .

environmental correlates of gene diversity
heterozygosity declined strongly with tectonic spreading rate , whether or not the off-axis gar sample was included in the analysis . spreading rates are negatively correlated with latitude  and the relationship is stronger with removal of the off-axis gar sample . depth is relatively monotonous along the epr axis and uncorrelated with the gene diversity indices. these correlations are clearly reflected in differences in the gene diversities between northern  and southern  populations, treated individually or as population clusters .

 <dig> nd: not determined because data were obtained from rflps.

demographic tests were initially conducted separately for each locus at each locality, but limited polymorphism in each sample provided essentially no power to reject null hypotheses. subsequent tests were conducted for the northern and southern population clusters . five out of six values for fu's fs were negative, though only one was statistically significant. mismatch distributions were all unimodal, suggesting an expanding population size, but the tests of demographic stability had very limited power due to low polymorphism.

discussion
riftia pachyptila exhibits the lowest mitochondrial coi diversity observed to date among  <dig> species of invertebrates sampled from eastern pacific hydrothermal vents . yet, the present data were not consistent with the hypothesis that a selective sweep eliminated mitochondrial diversity alone. levels of sequence diversity were similarly low for three nuclear genes and another mitochondrial gene, cytb. the shallow star-like haplotype networks exhibited by all four loci suggest that demographic factors affecting the entire genome were responsible for the reduced variation. gene diversity indices  for eight population samples were inversely correlated with tectonic spreading rates , which can be taken as surrogates for rates of habitat turnover. the lowest gene diversities occurred at southern  localities, which are subjected to superfast spreading rates of 142- <dig> mm/yr. active vents are closely spaced along the southern sepr axis , but r. pachyptila colonies were spotty there and individuals were scarce. in contrast, higher gene diversities occurred among the northern  localities, where spreading rates are slower, 65- <dig> mm/yr. active vents are more distantly spaced along the nepr axis, but dense r. pachyptila colonies occupied nearly all the active vents that we have explored along the nepr during the past  <dig> years. these observations are consistent with evidence from other vent species that gene diversity is correlated with vent "occupancy"  <cit> . species that occupy most of the active vent habitats in a region have high gene diversities compared to species with spottier distributions. here we have found the same relationship within a species. northern r. pachyptila have higher vent occupancy and gene diversity, whereas southern populations have low occupancy and low diversity. frequent cycles of extinction and colonization relative to time it takes to fix new mutations are expected to produce spotty distributions and correspondingly low gene diversity  <cit> . apparently, high rates of population turnover along the southern sepr axis has led to rapid coalescence on a small number of founders, but the origin of these founders remains a mystery.

population structure
overall, differentiation among r. pachyptila populations meets expectations for a linear stepping-stone model. pairwise estimates of differentiation, fst/, increased with geographical distances among the vent localities , particularly among the nepr/gar populations as previously reported for allozymes  <cit> . large distances  between the northern  and southern  population clusters greatly influenced the overall pattern, however. hierarchical amova attributed  <dig> % of total gene diversity to differences between the northern and southern clusters, but this evidence for subdivision may be an artifact of sampling gaps between the two regions. computer simulations have revealed that sampling gaps in a linear stepping-stone model can generate inflated pairwise fst's that may lead to incorrect inferences about population subdivision  <cit> . here, the trans-equatorial fst =  <dig>  between n <dig> and s <dig>  is smaller than the fst =  <dig>  between the n <dig> and n <dig> along the nepr , or between n <dig> and gar . even the fst's between closer pairs of nepr samples  were greater than the trans-equatorial pair. estimates of pairwise migration rates  between adjacent epr samples were similar, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  after excluding the three southern sepr samples for which fst ≈  <dig>  nonetheless, the existence of regional alleles  suggests that dispersal across the equator might not have achieved equilibrium with genetic drift .

the nepr, sepr and gar axes meet at the galápagos triple junction , which plunges to  <dig> m in the 50-km wide hess deep. active vents are not known from the hess deep proper, but video surveys of the adjacent hess deep rift valley have identified vents that host r. pachyptila, though they were not sampled . further exploration of the equatorial region is warranted because we do not know why it creates a variable dispersal filter for several vent taxa . hurtado et al.  <cit>  first noted that several annelid species exhibit variable impedance to dispersal across the equator, and plouviez et al.  <cit>  reported that one or more historical vicariance events might have separated nepr and sepr populations. the palm worm, alvinella pompejana, and limpets of the lepetodrilus elevatus species complex exhibit evidence for isolation across the equator, but the elevated φst's reported by plouviez et al. for other species may not be greater than expected from the sampling gaps between these axes  <cit> . variable impedance across such regions results from interactions between taxon-specific dispersal modes and physical factors  <cit> . for example, strong deep-ocean currents sweep eastward across the epr axis near the equator  <cit> . the removal of dispersing larvae from axial troughs by these currents and the apparent scarcity of vent habitats may together impede the dispersal of some species.

non-equilibrium processes
inferences about isolation-by-distance or stepping-stone models assume the constituent populations have achieved equilibrium between gene flow and genetic drift, but non-equilibrium scenarios can generate similar patterns of population structure  <cit> . if the equatorial region is a contact zone between partially isolated nepr and sepr populations, this too could produce differentiation that resembles the product of stepping-stone dispersal, but this hypothesis fails to explain the low gene diversity in sepr populations of r. pachyptila . magma supplies and associated tectonic and hydrothermal activities shift along ridge axes; thus, populations may be variably interconnected and disconnected by such shifts  <cit> . numerous closely spaced vents occur between 14°and 21°s latitude , and they are very young as evidenced by recent lava flows  <cit> . many of these vents host colonies of polychaetes, gastropods and bivalve mollusks  <cit> , but r. pachyptila was rare during the expeditions we mounted between  <dig> and  <dig> to vents between 14°and 21°s along the sepr. genetic homogeneity among sepr samples spanning  <dig> km suggests that genetic drift contributes very little to differentiation among these colonies, as expected if their average persistence time is shorter than the time it takes to fix neutral alleles  <cit> . these ephemeral vents may offer no more than a demographic sink for r. pachyptila. perhaps this region has been repeatedly colonized from more stable r. pachyptila sources that remain undiscovered. we searched for this species as far as 38°s latitude along a contiguous extension of the pacific-antarctic ridge . this latitude near the "roaring 40's" is the farthest south anyone has conducted operations with a human occupied research submersible. during five dives, we observed only a single r. pachyptila individual that could not be sampled before foul weather drove us from the location. if stable source populations exist elsewhere in this southern region, they would be expected to seed ephemeral sepr vents with genetically diverse propagules, reversing the observed cline in genic diversity. alternatively, the existence of many small  source populations seems unlikely given the high probability of local extinctions. although r. pachyptila might exist elsewhere along the pacific antarctic ridge, the present genetic evidence is consistent with colonization of the sepr from the nepr or gar axes.

CONCLUSIONS
other studies of mitochondrial variation in vent species have reported star-like genealogies that suggest recent range expansions or demographic instability . yet, the nuclear and mitochondrial gene networks from r. pachyptila are simpler and shallower than those found in all other vent annelids and mollusks examined to date . estimates of nucleotide diversity  for mitochondrial coi sequences are smaller by an order of magnitude than the nearest estimates from the other vent taxa. comparable estimates do not exist for the present nuclear markers, but the π values were of the same order of magnitude as mitochondrial cytb . although our attempts to examine indicators of demographic expansion with mismatch distributions were frustrated by the limited polymorphism, the overall lack of nuclear and mitochondrial variation itself suggests that r. pachyptila may be extraordinarily prone to population turnover that leads to rapid coalescence. high rates of local extinction coupled with relatively high rates of dispersal  from a limited number of source populations  are expected to produce the observed pattern of reduced diversity within and among disjunct colonies of a metapopulation  <cit> . which demographic factors have helped to retain genetic diversity in the co-distributed vent species, however, remain mysteries.
