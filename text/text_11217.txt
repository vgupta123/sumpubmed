BACKGROUND
entamoeba species comprise a group of unicellular eukaryotes that include parasitic organisms that infect humans. in particular, e. histolytica is the etiological agent responsible for amoebic dysentery and liver abscess leading to the death of hundreds of thousands of people annually. e. dispar, a closely related non-pathogenic species, is morphologically identical to e. histolytica but with very different pathogenic properties  <cit> . both species are able to colonize humans but only e. histolytica is able to cause invasive disease. behavior such as tissue damage and erythrophagocytosis is not seen with e. dispar in vivo. e. invadens is a reptilian parasite used as a model of encystation for e. histolytica, as e. invadens will form cysts in axenic cultures. e. invadens affects several reptile taxons, causing disease in squamates , and also causing significant morbidity and mortality in chelonians .

recently, new efforts have been made to improve the current e. histolytica genome assembly and annotation, and to complete the genome sequences for e. dispar and e. invadens. for this purpose, and in order to generate accurate gene predictions and annotation, a detail identification of repeat elements in the genome is fundamental. several families of transposable elements  have been described for the nuclear genome of these parasites  <cit> . it is well established that transposable elements play an important role in nuclear architecture, genome stability, gene amplification, and altered gene regulation  <cit> . in addition, as mentioned above, identification of repeat elements is essential for correct gene set generation, since unidentified tes can affect the quality of gene annotation and annotation-dependent analyses such as microarray-based gene expression studies  <cit> . for this reason, our initial goal was to identify and map all the tes that populate these three entamoeba genomes.

tes are conventionally classified into two broad classes, i and ii. class i includes two distinct types of tes, long terminal repeats  and non-ltr retroelements, both requiring reverse transcription from an rna intermediate. ltr retroelements include retroviruses and ty1/ty3-like retrotransposons, and are reverse transcribed from rna intermediates, duplicated, and then transposed as double-stranded dna. non-ltr retroelements consist of short or long interspersed nuclear elements, respectively sines or lines  <cit> , and are transposed by reverse transcription of mrna directly into the site of integration. on the other hand, class ii tes comprise elements that transpose dna .

even though tes can represent a large fraction of the nuclear genome of multicellular organisms  <cit> , it is only recently that we have a wealth of finished genome information from unicellular eukaryotes to expand the knowledge about the presence of tes in protozoan parasites such as entamoeba spp. recent reports have identified three different subfamilies of line and sine elements and a mutator-related dna transposon in e. histolytica; a single family of lines, sines, and mutator transposons in e. dispar; and a single line family and four types of class ii tes related to transposon superfamilies ty1/mariner, mutator, piggybac, and hat in e. invadens  <cit> .

the reassembly and reannotation of the e. histolytica nuclear genome and the completion  of the e. dispar and e. invadens genome sequences provided us with the necessary framework to perform a survey of the currently known entamoeba transposable elements, and gave us the opportunity to discover previously uncharacterized novel repetitive sequences. we have mapped all known class i and class ii transposons in these genomes, revealing that the collection of shared tes and the abundance of repetitive sequences are much larger than what was previously reported  <cit> . in addition, we report the identification and characterization of two novel tes, one of which is specific for e. histolytica. the present study provides insights into the evolution and diversity of transposable elements in these parasites and the role they could have played during genomic variation and speciation.

methods
repeat sequences accessions
examples of the transposable element sequences from e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. invadens described here have been submitted to genbank and can be searched under the following accession numbers: ed_line <dig>  eu099436; ed_sine <dig>  eu099437; ed_line <dig>  eu099438; ed_ere <dig>  eu099439; ed_sine <dig>  eu099440; ed_hydargos , eu099441; eh_ere <dig>  eu099442; eh_hydargos , eu099443; ehere <dig>  eu099444; ei_ere <dig>  eu099445; ei_line, eu <dig>  consensus sequences for eh_ere <dig>  ed_ere <dig>  ei_ere <dig>  eh_ere <dig>  ed_line <dig> and ed_sine <dig> elements were also submitted to repbase together with two representative sequences for ed_sine <dig> and ed_line <dig> 

genome sequence 
the genome sequencing for the three entamoeba species were performed in collaboration between the j. craig venter institute, jcvi ) and the sanger institute. the draft genome for e. histolytica was initially published by loftus et al  <cit> , and was re-assembled and re-annotated at jcvi . the genomes of e. dispar and e. invadens have been assembled and annotated at jcvi. the new assemblies for e. histolytica , e. dispar  and e. invadens  have been deposited in genbank and can be searched through the national center for biotechnology information  web site .

repeat finders analysis
several elements have been already characterized in these organisms . to survey the genomes, we created a comprehensive custom database containing all reported entamoeba elements from genbank and repbase  <cit>  and ran repeatmasker  to map and quantify the elements. to identify novel repeats we followed two different strategies. the first was to generate a library of highly repetitive sequences for each genome using repeatscout  <cit> . output sequences encoding known proteins or pfam domains were filtered out. the remaining repeats were surveyed for class i and class ii transposable elements with transposonpsi , a program that performs psi-blast searches using a set of position specific scoring matrices generated from different collections of te families. the second strategy was to perform all-versus-all genome sequence alignments using nucmer  followed by sequence clustering based on similarity. clusters containing most repetitive sequences were subsequently selected for further analysis.

, present; , absent. repeat subfamilies are denoted within parenthesis.

a tes identified in previous reports.

finally, consensus dna sequences for each repetitive element identified with either methodology were built from multiple sequence alignments with clustalx  <cit> . extensive manual examination of repeat structures and insertion sites was required for novel elements. putative orfs identified with orf finder  were conceptually translated.

non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate 
for a group of repeats containing conserved but non-coding sequences, it is expected no selection at the codon level. to verify the coding capacity of orfs identified in ere <dig> and ere <dig> we computed the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions   <cit>  on the dna sequence containing the orf of interest. for proteins under purifying selection it is expected a ω <<  <dig> while for proteins under strong positive selection the value should be ω >>  <dig>  a ω value close to  <dig> is an indication that sequences are under no selective pressure and therefore are unlikely to encode proteins  <cit> . to calculate ω, sequences were first aligned using muscle  <cit>  and the program codeml from paml  <cit>  was run using model m <dig> to calculate the overall  ω value for the orf of interest.

phylogenetic analysis
multiple sequence alignments for the different te families were constructed using clustalx followed by manual curation when necessary. next, phylogenetic trees were built by the neighbor-joining method using a bootstrap value of  <dig>  finally, trees were plotted with treeview .

genome coverage, repeat density and distribution
genome coverage and copy number estimations for each element were calculated by alignment of each repeat to the assembled genomes using repeatmasker. partial contiguous repeatmasker hits derived from the same te were counted as a single repeat if they were ordered with respect to the element and mapped less than  <dig> bp apart from each other. repeat coverage was estimated with respect to the total length of the respective genomes. distribution of repeats was analyzed using an in-house perl script to estimate the frequency and composition of different repeat clusters along the genomes. repeat densities were estimated per scaffold using the following equation:

 δrepeats=n×10000length 

where δ represents repeat density expressed as number of repeats every  <dig> kb, n is the number of repeats per scaffold and length is the scaffold length in base pairs.

identity- and dot-plots
construction of identity plots for syntenic regions between e. histolytica and e. dispar were generated using the pipmaker web resource  <cit> . dot-plots analyses were performed with dotter  <cit>  using a cutoff value of  <dig> identical nucleotides every  <dig> bp.

RESULTS
identification of entamoeba repetitive element  <dig> , a novel repetitive element of entamoeba sp
to identify all the repetitive elements present in the e. histolytica genome,  <dig> scaffolds from the current genomic sequence data were surveyed using repeatscout or an all-versus-all comparison approach as described in methods. in a preliminary screening, all known elements and new repetitive sequences above  <dig> bp were selected for further analysis. among this collection of repetitive sequences we identified several truncated copies of an at-rich  repeat that was named ere <dig> . to reconstruct the structure of an intact eh_ere <dig> we performed multiple sequence alignments of fragmented copies of the element using clustalx. the resulting consensus sequence showed that eh_ere <dig> is a  <dig>  bp te composed of an inner  <dig>  bp core region flanked by two  <dig>  bp terminal inverted repeats  . the core region contained a single open reading frame  potentially coding for a  <dig> amino acids protein with an average percent of identity of 72% at the protein level among all eh_ere <dig> tes. no homologue to this protein was found in the genbank non-redundant protein database. however, sequence comparisons to the ncbi clusters of orthologous groups of proteins , a database that clusters proteins based on their phylogenetic relationship, showed a weak but consistent similarity  to proteins belonging to two different groups of genes associated to dna metabolism: chromosome segregation atpases  and atpases involved in dna repair .

genome distribution analysis showed that eh_ere <dig> is primarily inserted in at-rich intergenic regions frequently nearby other repetitive elements ; no instances were found where its integration disrupted a protein-coding gene. estimation of eh_ere <dig> copy number with repeatmasker showed that there are  <dig> fragmented copies of eh_ere <dig> scattered along the e. histolytica genome spanning a total of  <dig> mb bp of genomic sequence. this estimation includes  <dig> putative complete elements where truncations coincide with the end of scaffolds .

a repeats were considered complete when their length was at least 90% of the consensus sequence.

b expressed as percentage of the corresponding genome length.

blast searches against the genomes of e. dispar and e. invadens revealed that ere <dig> is also present in these two species, although the overall structural organization of the elements differs from that in e. histolytica. in e. dispar, ere <dig>  is a  <dig>  bp element composed of a central  <dig> bp region containing a putative orf and flanked by two inverted ed_sine <dig> sequences. the orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein 81% identical at the amino acid level to the one from the consensus eh_ere <dig> . it is interesting to note that although in e. histolytica eh_ere <dig> is flanked by a different type of tir, the single copy of ed_sine <dig> identified so far in e. histolytica   <cit>  is inserted next to a truncated eh_ere <dig> element that carries the whole coding sequence of the element, resembling the organization of ed_ere <dig> in e. dispar . both, the central region of ed_ere <dig> and ed_sine <dig>  were found inserted alone throughout the e. dispar genome, suggesting that at some point during evolution, these two elements were able to transpose independently from each other. because the previous observation implies that these two elements might be independent, ed_ere <dig> coverage and copy number were estimated independently from ed_sine <dig>  we identified  <dig> copies of ed_ere <dig> including  <dig> complete elements, spanning a total of  <dig> kb of genomic sequence .

similar analysis in e. invadens showed that ere <dig>  contains a single putative orf coding for a  <dig> aa protein with 30% identity  to the putative eh_ere <dig> peptide , but we could not find any large tir flanking the coding region. due to the low degree of conservation among ei_ere <dig> tes, it was not possible to accurately define the boundaries of the element. for this reason, genomic distribution was estimated using the most conserved portion of ei_ere <dig> represented by a  <dig>  bp dna fragment spanning a single orf. this approach revealed that the genome of e. invadens contains  <dig> copies of ei_ere <dig>   <dig> of which are complete elements , spanning  <dig> kb  of genomic sequence .

to discard that the single gene found in ere <dig> is not a spurious orf caused by the at-rich composition of this element we computed the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions  for this gene in each species. if the orfs were not functional or spurious it would be expected to find a similar number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions and therefore, the dn/ds ratio  should be close to  <dig>  in the three cases the omega value was significantly lower than  <dig> , indicating that the gene coded by ere <dig> is under purifying selection.

comparative sequence analysis between these genomes revealed several syntenic regions between e. histolytica and e. dispar where ere <dig> was inserted in one genome but not the other  supporting the hypothesis that at some point in the evolution of these species ere <dig> was able to transpose, although it is not clear whether it is still active.

identification of entamoeba repetitive element  <dig> , a transposon-like element specific to e. histolytica
further analysis of the e. histolytica genome led us to the identification of a second  <dig>  bp repetitive element named ere <dig> . its consensus sequence consists of a  <dig>  bp sequence flanked by two  <dig> bp imperfect tirs that are 82% identical . the internal fragment contains a putative orf coding for a  <dig> aa polypeptide with no homology to any known protein. however, estimation of the dn/ds ratio indicated that this orfs is under purifying selection  strongly suggesting that it is a real protein coding gene. interspecies comparative sequence analysis exposed many copies of eh_ere <dig> that are absent in the corresponding syntenic regions from e. dispar supporting the hypothesis that eh_ere <dig> is a transposable element . hoha closer examination of the ere <dig> integration site indicated that the element inserts preferentially into at-rich intergenic regions . during transposition ere <dig> generates 3– <dig> bp target site duplications , but it does not seem to recognize any specific targeting genomic sequence. we quantified approximately  <dig> copies of ere <dig> in the e. histolytica genome, including  <dig> complete elements , representing a total genomic coverage of  <dig> kb . contrary to eh_ere <dig>  we could not find any copy of ere <dig> in the genomes of either e. dispar or e. invadens, suggesting that e. histolytica acquired this te independently after diverging from e. dispar, its closest relative.

identification of mariner transposons in the genomes of e. histolytica and e. dispar
pritham et. al  <cit>  reported the existence of five different families of transposons belonging to the tc1/mariner superfamily in the genomes of e. invadens and e. moshkovskii , suggesting that these tes were already present in the common ancestor of the three entamoeba species in this study. however, no such transposons have been identified in e. histolytica and e. dispar, raising the question whether e. invadens and e. moshkovskii acquired these mariner transposons by horizontal transfer or vertically from the common ancestor. to address this issue we used transposon-psi, an analysis tool developed in-house to identify sequences homologous to large and diverse families of transposable elements  to look for mariner-related sequences in the genomes of e. histolytica and e. dispar. the program identified two genomic regions, one from each organism, that gave a highly significant hit  against a mariner transposase from drosophila melanogaster . both regions contained an orf coding for a  <dig> aa and a  <dig> aa protein in e. histolytica  and e. dispar  respectively. these putative proteins shared 95% identity throughout their entire sequence suggesting that they could correspond to the same locus in both genomes. further comparative analyses of a  <dig> kb genomic region encompassing these orfs confirmed that eh_mariner and ed_mariner were syntenic . unfortunately, it was not possible to determine the precise boundary of the elements due to the short nature of the mariner tirs   <cit> .

blastp searches revealed that eh_mariner and ed_mariner were closely related to hydargos , an e. invadens transposon that belongs to the tc1/mariner superfamily  <cit> . this was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method . as expected, eh_mariner and ed_mariner coding proteins contained a d,d33d motif, typical of this type of transposase .

evolutionary study of line elements in e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. invadens
previous studies have demonstrated the existence of several families of non-ltr retrotransposons related to the r <dig> group of line elements in the genomes of e. histolytica  <cit> , e. dispar  <cit>  and e. invadens  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, there is no current analysis of how these entamoeba tes are related to each other. to better understand the evolutionary history of these retrotransposons we mapped all the line elements in the three genomes and studied their relationship based on phylogenetic analysis . this approach led to the identification of two additional line subfamilies in the genome of e. dispar. the first element, named ed_line <dig>  shares 86% nucleotide similarity with eh_line <dig> of e. histolytica. ed_line <dig> integrates into at-rich intergenic regions generating tsds at both ends of the element. the consensus ed_line <dig> is a  <dig>  bp te that contains a putative 5' orf coding for a  <dig> aa protein of unknown function and a second orf that encodes a  <dig> aa reverse transcriptase protein with a c-terminal domain containing a nucleic acid binding site and a nuclease motif  <cit> . all the elements identified to date contain multiple stop codons interrupting at least one of the two orfs suggesting there are no functional copies of ed_line <dig> in e. dispar. the second element, ed_line <dig>  is a  <dig>  bp sequence that shares more than 70% identity at the nucleotide level with eh_line <dig>  contrary to ed_line <dig>  ed_line <dig> termini are poorly conserved and therefore no flanking tsd could be identified. these results suggest that line <dig> and line <dig> subfamilies were already present in the common ancestor to e. histolytica and e. dispar.

characterization of the single line element previously identified in e. invadens  <cit>  indicated that ei_line is a  <dig>  bp sequence flanked by tsds . only two complete copies of ei_line were found in e. invadens and neither of them had a complete orf coding for a reverse transcriptase protein.

phylogenetic analysis based on manual reconstruction of the reverse transcriptase consensus sequence indicated that all lines found in the three entamoeba species were derived from a single ancestral sequence that was already present before they diverged from each other . at a later point in evolution, in the ancestral line that led to e. histolytica and e. dispar, line tes split into two separate lineages giving rise to the eh/ed_line <dig> and eh/ed_line <dig> subfamilies. subsequently, in this same ancestor, a third line subfamily diverged from line <dig> giving origin to eh_line <dig> in e. histolytica and ed_line <dig> in e. dispar .

identification of an e. histolytica eh_sine2-like element in the genome of e. dispar
the genomes of e. histolytica and e. dispar share most of their line and sine families as indicated above  <cit> . indeed, e. histolytica line1- <dig> have their counterparts in e. dispar: ed_line <dig> <cit> , and ed_line2- and ed_line3-like sequences ; while e. dispar ed_sine <dig> is equivalent to e. histolytica eh_sine <dig> and closely related to eh_sine <dig>  however, to date there is no evidence pointing to the existence of an element equivalent to eh_sine <dig> in e. dispar. to verify this observation, we performed blastn searches of the e. dispar genome with eh_sine <dig> identifying a  <dig> bp element  68% identical at the nucleotide level to eh_sine <dig>  a multiple sequence alignment of these two elements showed a high degree of conservation at the 5' and 3' ends while the central regions were more divergent. we mapped a total of  <dig> copies of ed_sine <dig> in e. dispar including  <dig> complete elements . these results indicate that all the non-autonomous sine elements together with the three line subfamilies already existed in the common ancestor before the speciation process that gave rise to e. histolytica and e. dispar.

origin of ed_sine1/eh_sine <dig> in the genomes of e. dispar and e. histolytica
shire et al  <cit>  identified ed_sine <dig> in the genome of e. dispar, a sine element homologous to the single copy of eh_sine <dig> found in e. histolytica  <cit> . nevertheless, the origin of ed_sine1/eh_sine <dig> is not clear. to elucidate this issue, we performed dot-plot alignments of ed_sine1/eh_sine <dig> against eh_sine <dig> and eh_sine <dig>  this analysis showed that the 5' end of ed_sine1/eh_sine <dig> is more similar to eh_sine <dig> whereas it's 3' end resembles eh_sine <dig> . this result was subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using either the first  or last   <dig> bp of these elements together with similar fragments from eh_line <dig> and eh_line <dig>  this study suggests that in the common ancestor of e. histolytica and e. dispar, ed_sine1/eh_sine <dig> originated as a chimeric element; its 5' end derived from the precursor sequence of eh_sine2/ed_sine <dig>  and its 3' end originated from an ancestral eh_sine1-like element  . if this is the case, then there should be some evidence in e. dispar indicating that such ancestral eh_sine1-like elements existed in the common ancestor of these two parasites. a survey of the e. dispar genome with the sequence from eh_sine <dig> revealed the existence of a  <dig> bp element with more than 83% identity to eh_sine <dig> . this element was interrupted by the insertion of an ed_sine <dig>  <dig> bp from its 5' end generating  <dig> bp duplications of part of the eh_sine1-like sequence at either side of the integration site. manual reconstruction of the original element, followed by phylogenetic analysis, confirmed that this sequence was closely related to eh_sine <dig>  and was named ed_sine <dig>  the fact that we found only two full-length copies of ed_sine <dig> in e. dispar suggests that this element is no longer functional and the remaining copies are just "fossil" sequences derived from a previously active element in the e. histolytica and e. dispar ancestral genome.

our repeat survey identified several additional copies of eh_sine <dig> scattered along the e. histolytica genome . comparative sequence analysis of regions containing eh_sine <dig> elements in e. histolytica showed many cases where their syntenic counterparts in e. dispar lacked an ed_sine <dig> inserted in an equivalent position, demonstrating that eh_sine <dig> was able to transpose in e. histolytica after its separation from e. dispar. moreover, we found one case where two eh_sine <dig> elements were 99% identical suggesting that the element could be still active.

altogether, the analysis described above suggests that the pair ed_sine1/eh_sine <dig> originated as a chimeric element in the common ancestor of e. histolytica and e. dispar and was subsequently amplified in e. histolytica and, more successfully, in e. dispar associated with ed_ere <dig> and ed_line <dig> or as an independent repeat.

representation of transposable elements in entamoeba sp
in a recent comparative analysis of the distribution of line and sine elements in e. histolytica, bakre et al.  <cit>  reported that tes account for just 6% of this genome. however, that estimation was based on a previous draft of the e. histolytica assembly and did not include other tes identified in this paper. similarly, pritham et al  <cit>  reported a quantification of tes for e. histolytica, e. dispar, and e. invadens based solely on blast hits to unassembled reads from the sanger database. to estimate the abundance of tes in the current e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. invadens genome assemblies we map all tes identified to date in these three genomes using repeatmasker. this analysis revealed that tes span  <dig>  mb  of the e. histolytica genome with line and sine retrotransposons representing a total of  <dig> % . eh_line <dig> constitutes the largest family of tes in e. histolytica with a total of  <dig> elements, including  <dig> complete copies and  <dig> putative complete elements, truncated due to their location at the end of assemblies. similarly, ed_line <dig> is the most frequent line in e. dispar having  <dig> copies with  <dig> complete and  <dig> putative complete elements that map at the end of assemblies .

consistent with previous reports  <cit> , we identified a lower representation of line and sine elements in the genomes of e. dispar  and e. invadens . all the lines identified in the three genomes have one or more in-frame stop codons or frame-shifts interrupting at least one of their putative protein coding genes. however, since sequence coverage for e. dispar and e. invadens is 5x, we cannot rule out that some of these mutations are artifacts caused by sequencing errors.

a similar cross-species distribution was found for ere <dig>  which is more abundant in e. histolytica  followed by e. dispar  and e. invadens . on the other hand, estimation of transposon coverage showed the opposite situation. indeed, dna transposons spanned a total of  <dig>  mb of the e. invadens genome, while just a few copies of class ii elements were found in e. histolytica and e. dispar . this distributional bias observed across the three entamoeba species analyzed in this study confirmed previous quantification results performed on unassembled genomic sequences  <cit> .

distribution of transposable elements in entamoeba sp
to investigate the distribution of tes in the three species we plotted the frequency of all inter-repeat distances for each genome using  <dig> bp bins . this analysis showed that inter-repeat distances follow a right-skewed distribution with a median value significantly lower than the mean distance indicating that, in the three entamoebas, tes tend to be clustered instead of evenly distributed along the genomes. e. histolytica has the most compactly clustered repeats with 50% of the tes separated by less than  <dig> bp while median distance values for e. dispar and e. invadens are  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively . to determine the composition of repeat-clusters we quantified the number of times all possible pairs of repeats belonged to the same repeat-cluster, defining as repeat-cluster a series of repeats separated by up to  <dig> bp . this quantification showed that in e. histolytica eh_ere <dig> is the element most frequently found in the clusters  followed by eh_line <dig>  and eh_ere <dig> . most repeat-repeat co-occurrences exist among long tes with the exception of eh_ere <dig> that also clusters with eh_sine <dig> and eh_sine <dig> at high frequency. there is an evident linkage between ed_ere <dig>  ed_line <dig> and ed_sine <dig> in e. dipar, while in e. invadens transposons from the dde and mariner families show the maximum number of interactions with other repeats .

further investigation of the numerous interactions between ed_ere <dig>  ed_line <dig> and ed_sine <dig> showed that in e. dispar the genomic region syntenic to the e. histolytica locus containing the single reported copy of eh_sine <dig>  <cit>  displays a similar repeat organization containing an ed_sine <dig> in-between an ed_line <dig> and an ed_ere <dig> elements . this three-component structure is found amplified  <dig> times in the genome of e. dispar and seen even more frequently is a two-component unit composed of an ed_sine <dig> linked to either ed_ere <dig> or ed_line <dig> .

an analysis of te dispersion along the scaffolds revealed that 90% of the genomic sequence in e. histolytica has a repeat density of less than  <dig> repeats every  <dig> kb, the mean value for this genome . a similar uneven repeat density was observed for e. dispar and e. invadens, where 75% or more of the genomic sequence has a te content below the average . these results demonstrate that repeats and repeat-clusters are not uniformly distributed along these genomes but they are enriched in relatively small genomic regions, while most of the three genomes have a te content below their average density.

discussion
in this work we report the first complete whole genome survey of transposable elements for the newly generated assemblies of e. histolytica, e. dispar, and e. invadens. this analysis led to the identification of two novel entamoeba-specific repetitive elements, ere <dig> and ere <dig>  two line and two sine subfamilies in e. dispar, and a mariner-related sequence in the genomes of e. histolytica and e. dispar. we also found that te representation in e. histolytica is much higher than previously thought . a comparison between repeat coverage in the old and new e. histolytica assemblies revealed that both genbank releases have similar repeat contents . therefore, the higher repeat coverage reported herein is likely due to two main factors: the use of a more sensitive algorithm to identify repetitive regions  and the discovery of two novel te families  based on intra- and inter-species sequence comparison.

our analysis also confirms previous results showing that the population of tes in e. histolytica and e. dispar is enriched in non-ltr retroelements while e. invadens contains mostly class ii transposons  <cit> . despite this bias, lines, ere1s, and transposons from mariner and mutator superfamilies were found in the three genomes indicating they were already present in the common ancestor rather than acquired horizontally after the three species diverged from each other.

among all the tes reported in this work, ere <dig> and ere <dig> are the most intriguing. both elements have features in common such as a high at content, the presence of a single orf, two tirs delimiting their termini , and their integration into intergenic regions . although their putative encoded proteins have no significant hits against any known transposase, their structure resembles that of dna transposons. in particular, ere <dig> is flanked by two  <dig> bp imperfect tirs and generates tsds similar to other known dna transposons such as mutyl  <cit> , pat  <cit>  and gulliver  <cit> . the ω values calculated for the orfs found in ere <dig> and ere <dig> suggest that both genes are under purifying selection and might still be functional. moreover, we have found e. histolytica est evidence that suggests that both eh_ere <dig> and eh_ere <dig> are transcribed in this parasite. in addition, comparative sequence analysis between the genomes of e. histolytica and e. dispar shows many cases where both tes are found inserted in genomic loci from one entamoeba genome but not in their syntenic counterparts from the other species, strongly supporting the idea that these two elements were able to transpose at some point in evolution. due to its absence in other entamoeba species studied in this report, eh_ere <dig> seems to be the only te in e. histolytica that has been acquired by horizontal transfer.

given the high degree of conservation between the genomes of e. histolytica and its closely related non-pathogenic species e. dispar, it is important to ask how e. histolytica causes disease. it is well established in prokaryotic organisms that dna repeats can mediate genomic rearrangements that can alter the expression of disease-associated genes  <cit> . for example, in pathogenic bacteria such as neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis, repeat-mediated rearrangements promote positioning of cell surface genes next to "on switches", causing otherwise silent genes to be expressed  <cit> . therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the acquisition and posterior amplification of elements such as eh_ere <dig> in the genome of e. histolytica has played a role in speciation and acquisition of pathogenicity traits promoting genome rearrangements or altering the function or number of genes involved in processes such as cell attachment, evasion of the host immune response, etc. for example, it has been described that the leucine-rich/bspa-like gene family, that codes for proteins that seem to localize to the parasite plasma membrane and might interact with the host fibronectin  <cit> , is frequently associated to tes  <cit> . we have determined that  <dig> out of  <dig> of these genes are at less than  <dig> kb of a repetitive sequence . currently, we are carrying out studies looking for additional gene families associated to tes in e. histolytica.

contrary to eh_ere <dig>  ere <dig> is present in the genomes of the three entamoeba species analyzed in this study and its single orf encodes a putative protein similar to members from two ncbi cogs composed of proteins associated with dna repair and recombination. considering both the structural features of this repetitive element and the fact that the ere1-encoded polypeptide is similar to proteins involved in dna metabolism, our data suggest that ere <dig> is likely a class ii te. interestingly, the coding region of ere <dig> is associated with different types of terminal repeats depending on the organism. while in e. histolytica the ere <dig> coding region is generally flanked by the same  <dig>  bp tir, in e. dispar ere <dig> is often associated to other tes, mainly ed_sine <dig>  and to a lesser extent ed_line <dig> and ed_sine <dig>  therefore, it is not clear whether ed_ere <dig> is able to transpose independently or if it requires the presence of a nearby repeat. moreover, 47% of the eh_ere <dig> elements found in e. histolytica map within repeat-clusters linked to other tes  and hence, it is possible that the significant expansion of repeats in this parasite had also contributed to the observed 34% increase in the number of eh_ere <dig> repeats compared to the frequency of ed_ere <dig> in the e. dispar genome. lastly, in e. invadens ei_ere <dig> is poorly conserved and we were unable to identify any copy associated to other repeats. both the low copy number and degree of conservation among ei_ere1s suggest that this element is not longer functional in e. invadens.

our study also revealed that eh_sine3/ed_sine <dig> is a chimeric element where the 5' end was derived from eh_sine2/ed_sine <dig> and the 3' end from eh_sine1/ed_sine <dig>  in addition to the single eh_sine <dig> previously reported for e. histolytica  <cit> , we could identify at least  <dig> intact and  <dig> truncated copies of the element in this genome . the identification of eh_sine <dig> elements integrated into e. histolytica loci without the presence of a ed_sine <dig> in the corresponding syntenic regions from e. dispar  indicates that eh_sine <dig> remained active in e. histolytica after its separation from e. dispar.

our analysis of the distribution of line and sine retrotransposons in the three entamoeba genomes demonstrates that all line elements derived from a common ancestral te related to the r <dig> group of lines . line elements remained silent in the lineage that led to e. invadens, but were very active in the ancestor of e. histolytica and e. dispar, where gave rise to three different line and sine subfamilies. it is not clear whether these non-ltr retroelements are currently active.

although we identified no lines having an intact orf <dig> and orf <dig>  there were some line <dig> and line <dig> elements in e. histolytica and e. dispar with either a complete orf <dig> or orf <dig> coding for a putative protein with a reverse transcriptase domain. it has been reported that line elements with a non-functional mutation of its reverse transcriptase gene are still able to transpose using the proteins coded by a functional line element  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that these elements are still able to transpose using the required replication machinery in trans. mapping of assembled ests onto the e. histolytica genome using pasa   <cit> , revealed that some copies of eh_sine <dig> and eh_sine <dig> are actually transcribed, but we found no evidence of expressed line genes. however, blast searches against unassembled e. histolytica ests identified several ests that are at least 98% identical to eh_line <dig>  eh_line <dig> or eh_line <dig> supporting the idea that lines might still be active in e. histolytica.

a striking difference between e. invadens and the genomes of e. histolytica and e. dispar is the compositional bias in their respective te populations. our results confirmed previous studies  <cit>  showing that in e. invadens most of the collection of repetitive elements is composed of class ii transposons while the other two species are rich in class i repeats. since e. moshkovskii and e. invadens have a similar set of dna transposons, pritham et al  <cit>  proposed that most of these repeats should have been present in the common ancestor and not incorporated horizontally. thus, there should be some evidence for the previous existence of such elements in the genomes of e. histolytica and e. dispar. the results presented herein indicate that at least a mariner family, related to the transposon hydargos from e. invadens, was present in the ancestral entamoeba genome that gave origin to the three species studied in this work. the fact that e. histolytica and e. dispar only have a single identifiable copy of a hydargos-related element and the low degree of conservation of the residues surrounding the three catalytic aspartic acids of its putative transposase  suggests that this te is not active.

the repeat survey of e. histolytica, e. dispar, and e. invadens reveals a much higher representation of repetitive elements than previously reported  <cit> . although it is not clear whether tes are playing a role in amoeba fitness, it seems likely that the high coverage of repetitive elements in e. histolytica  could play a part in the high frequency of genomic variation among the parasite population. this could explain, in part, why less than 25% of the e. histolytica infections cause disease  <cit> . moreover, this study demonstrates that in these genomes transposable elements have a clustered distribution with more than 75% of the genome containing a repeat density below the average, and a small portion of the genome  containing a high repeat density. repeats and repeat-clusters might work as hot spots for recombination promoting rearrangement between chromosomes and contributing to genome plasticity. mukherjee et al.  <cit>  have shown that e. histolytica is able to change its dna content and size when switching between xenic and axenic conditions. although these changes seem to be mainly caused by variations in the number of copies of the entire genome, the authors propose that some specific regions could be differentially amplified or deleted  <cit> . if that is the case, then it seems plausible that repeats and repeat-clusters may be playing a role in these processes.

during our comparative sequence analysis between e. histolytica and e. dispar we identified many syntenic break points rich in repetitive elements  where similarity disappears within tes  suggesting that recombination occurred within repetitive regions. therefore, it is likely that the striking enrichment of tes in e. histolytica had contributed to its divergence from e. dispar.

the combined approach using intra- and inter-species comparative sequence analysis and transposonpsi searches based on position-specific scoring matrices specific for different families of repetitive elements led to the identification of several novel tes that had not been detected in previous studies  <cit>  and showed that e. histolytica and e. dispar share most of their te repertoire with the exception of eh_ere <dig>  whether the acquisition of eh_ere <dig> and/or the remarkable amplification of tes contributed to e. histolytica pathogenicity remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides the first insight into the composition and genomic organization of transposable elements for the newly generated assemblies of e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. invadens. our analysis shows that the e. histolytica genome has three times more transposable elements than previously reported , and twice as much as its closest relative, e. dispar. transposable elements are not uniformly distributed but have a tendency of being aggregated forming clusters. repeat-clusters are frequently found at syntenic break points between e. histolytica and e. dispar, vouching for the contribution of transposable elements to genome instability and speciation. the expansion of line and sine retroelements in the common ancestor to e. histolytica and e. dispar gave origin to three different families of line and sine elements. we also describe two novel transposable elements, ere <dig> and ere <dig>  ere <dig> was present in the common ancestor of the three entamoebas but it was expanded in the linage that led to e. histolytica and e. dispar, while ere <dig> was acquired by e. histolytica after its divergence from e. dispar. all together the results presented in this study contribute to a better understanding about the genome architecture of these organisms and will help to clarify the processes that might have contributed to genome variation and speciation in these parasites, particularly between pathogenic e. histolytica and non-pathogenic e. dispar.
