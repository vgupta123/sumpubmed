BACKGROUND
pentatrico peptide repeat  proteins are present in yeasts, mammals, plants, protists and are thought to be present in most eukaryotes  <cit> . all of these organisms have p class ppr proteins that are characterized by tandem repeats of a degenerate  <dig> amino acid motif. the ppr family of proteins has greatly expanded in land plants  <cit> . in addition to the p class of ppr proteins, roughly half of land plant ppr proteins have a repeating tripartite sequence of p, l, and s type ppr repeats  <cit> . pls type proteins typically have additional c-terminal domains known as the e, e + and dyw domains  <cit> . the dyw domain may be the catalytic deaminase domain based on the conserved residues that are similar to cytidine deaminases, evolutionary co-incidence with rna editing, and structural models that suggest a deaminase-like conformation  <cit> . ppr proteins are known to be required for rna editing, splicing, stabilization, and cleavage in plant organelles  <cit> .

cytidines are edited to uridines in many mitochondrial and chloroplasts transcripts  <cit> . rna editing typically leads to the maintenance of an evolutionary conserved codon at the rna level, and is thought to repair errors that were allowed to accumulate in the genome  <cit> . in the plant a. thaliana, fifteen ppr proteins have been identified that are necessary for editing  <dig> of the  <dig> known chloroplast rna editing sites  <cit> . the genes that have been shown to be required for chloroplast editing are pls type ppr proteins and include at least the c-terminal e domain, while the presence of the e + and dyw domains varies. disruption of some ppr genes that are required for editing results in photosynthetic defects  <cit> , while disruption of other ppr genes lead to weak phenotypes in spite of the elimination of editing at one or more editing sites  <cit> . although detailed mechanisms for rna binding are not known, amino acid changes in ppr proteins have been associated with changes in editing efficiency  <cit> , and this observation suggests that there is significant co-evolution between nuclear-encoded editing factors and organellar rna cis-elements. editing activity for an exogenous site was observed in a plant that lacked an endogenous target, suggesting that the conservation of the editing activity occurred independently from an editing target  <cit> .

loss of cognate editing sites for a ppr has been shown to result in pseudogene formation that was apparently the result of the loss of evolutionary selection in the absence of the target editing site  <cit> . in this study, we show that multiple independent losses of an editing site target correlates with truncation of a pls type ppr gene and elimination of the editing-associated e/e + domains in the c-terminus. unexpectedly, even in the absence of the known editing site target, the truncated ppr genes are maintained under strong negative selection. the maintenance of strong negative selection suggests that these orphan ppr genes might have an additional unrecognized function that is independent of the known chloroplast rna editing function.

RESULTS
the evolution of editing sites associated with four brassicaceae ppr genes
four ppr genes  were selected for this study based on the number of editing site targets and their distribution in brassicaceae species . crr <dig> and crr <dig> are each required for editing a single site in a. thaliana chloroplasts. crr <dig> is required for editing ndhd c <dig> which is present in all species of brassicaceae that were examined, and this condition is referred to as “homogenous” . in contrast, the crr <dig> editing site target has been replaced by a genomic t and is absent in some crucifer species, and the editing site is “heterogeneous” in these taxa . clb <dig> and otp <dig> each have two editing site targets in a. thaliana . for the clb <dig> editing site targets, both editing sites are present in all species examined, while each of the otp <dig> sites is heterogeneous within the surveyed taxa .

the extent of editing site conversion of the six editing sites associated with crr <dig>  crr <dig>  clb <dig>  and otp <dig> was determined in  <dig> species using bulk sequencing of cdna . the organisms included the  <dig> crucifer species with known plastid genomes plus species of agronomic importance  and representatives from diverse branches of the family . targets of crr <dig>  and clb <dig>  were determined to be edited in all species examined . the percentage of edited transcripts for the crr <dig> target, ndhd c <dig>  varied dramatically from 10-80% . the clb <dig> target, clpp c <dig>  was nearly fully edited in all species; however, the conversion of the second editing site target, rpoa c <dig>  varied from 40-90% edited transcripts . thus, several species tolerate reduced editing of rpoa c <dig> in contrast to clpp c <dig> 

data are expressed as percent of cs converted to u. a “t” indicates that the plastid genome encodes a t at this position.

several brassicaceae species lack editing sites targeted by crr <dig>  and otp <dig>  . the crr <dig> editing site target  was either fully edited or the editing site was lost through substitution with a genomic t. this result is consistent with strong selection for complete rna editing driven by a requirement for efficient chlororespiration  <cit> . a cladogram was constructed from ndhbndhdndhg, and clpp sequences to illustrate the evolutionary relationships of the  <dig> species . the tree topology is consistent with a larger cladogram generated using its sequences for a larger pool of brassicaceae sequences  <cit> . the four losses of ndhd c <dig> are observed at different leaves on a cladogram , demonstrating that multiple, independent losses of editing sites occurred during the evolution of the brassicaceae. these results expand on an earlier report of multiple independent losses of matk editing sites during plant evolution  <cit> .

the evolution of otp <dig> editing site targets was the most complex of the four examples. two independent losses of the ndhb c <dig> editing site were observed . in one example, the ndhb c <dig> editing site was lost through a c to t genomic mutation in a node impacting many brassicaceae species , while the second example occurred in the final branch leading to m. incana. for the ndhg c <dig> editing site, three species have either a genomic t that eliminates an editing site or retention of a c and loss of rna editing . l. maritima retains the c at ndhg c <dig>  but the transcripts exhibit less than 10% conversion to a t in the green leaf tissue examined . in the branch leading to a. hirsuta and d. nemorosa, ndhg c <dig> was replaced by a genomic t in d. nemorosa, but remains as an unedited c in a. hirsuta . rna editing of ndhg c <dig> creates an f or l codon from an s codon in brassicaceae; therefore, loss of editing would lead to radical amino acid substitutions in a. hirsuta and l maritima.

cis-elements for chloroplast editing sites are generally considered to be within nucleotides − <dig> to + <dig> relative to the edited c  <cit> . the region comprising the cis-elements for the six editing sites examine in this study are nearly identical in the species examined . in the lineages where an editing site is absent for crr <dig> , the cis-elements for ndhd c <dig> show no unique substitutions compared with species that edit this site . in the case of otp <dig>  nucleotide differences are present in the a. hirsuta cis-element for ndhg c <dig> and might interfere with editing site recognition. however, the cis-elements are unchanged in l. maritima and in i. amara, yet the ndhg c <dig> editing site exhibits a highly reduced level of conversion in these species . editing is not required at the other otp <dig> editing site  as a result of a genomic t in that position. thus, the inability to edit ndhb c <dig> in these species is probably the result of a loss of editing activity rather than a change in the recognition of the cis-element.

the evolution of ppr genes in plants lacking an editing target
sequences for putative orthologs to crr <dig>  crr <dig>  clb <dig>  and otp <dig> were obtained for representative brassicaceae species through pcr and bulk sequencing . each putative ppr gene shares the same basic architecture in terms of number and order of ppr repeats . an unrooted nj phylogenetic tree built using the sequences indicates that each of the four ppr genes forms its own clade, and these genes are apparently orthologous .

several species in the brassicaceae have lost editing targets for crr <dig> or otp <dig> . putative orthologs for crr <dig> were detected in brassicaceae species that lack the known target for this gene . the a. thaliana crr <dig> gene contains  <dig> ppr repeats and e and e + domains. truncated crr <dig> genes were detected in three species: b. verna was truncated in ppr repeat 17; and both l. maritima and t. arvense were truncated in the middle of the e domain . these truncated genes are known to be expressed as mrnas since they were amplified as cdnas by 3’-race. since plants have frequently undergone genome or gene duplication, it is possible that additional full length copies of the crr <dig> gene might be present in these species. based on pcr and 3’-race, the truncated forms of crr <dig> represent the only intact crr <dig> orthologs that could be detected in these species .

since these taxa are separated on distinct branches , these results indicate that multiple independent truncation of the crr <dig> gene has occurred in species that have lost the editing site target. remnants of the full e domain are easily detectable in t. arvense; however, the sequences derived from the e domain are not evident in 3’ utr sequences from b. verna and l. maritima . thus, the truncation in t. arvense is probably a more recent event. recent loss of an editing target is also likely for three matthiola species that have full length crr <dig> putative orthologs . a fourth matthiola species examined, matthiola longipetala, is capable of editing ndhd c <dig>  suggesting that the loss of editing target has occurred recently in the genus .

the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, dn/ds, is a fundamental measure of the type and strength of selection that a protein coding gene has experienced  <cit> . genes under strong negative selection exhibit small dn/ds values ; this results from very few nucleotide substitutions that are expressed as amino acid substitutions. a dn/ds value of  <dig> indicates neutral selection, and dn/ds values greater than  <dig> indicate positive selection. the dn/ds values for the putative orthologs of crr <dig> in species that have lost editing targets are much less than  <dig>  and are shown in table  <dig>  orphaned crr <dig> genes, including both the truncated and the full length examples, are maintained under strong negative selection.

sequences from a wider taxon sampling were examined to identify whether truncation of crr <dig> genes is a common feature or restricted to the brassicaceae. additional crr <dig> and otp <dig> genes were identified through phytozome  <dig>  in the sequenced genomes of m. esculenta, r. communis, p. trichocarpa, m. truncatula, g. max, c. sativus, p. persica, a. lyrata, c. papaya, c. sinensis, c. clementine, e. grandis, v. vinifera, m. guttatus, and a. coerulea. genes were considered to be putative orthologs if they had greater than 50% sequence identity, were reciprocal best hits to arabidopsis ppr proteins by tblastn, and formed a distinct clade on a nj tree with the brassicaceae members . truncated forms of crr <dig> were detected in three species of the malpighiales , and no full length crr <dig> genes were found in any of these species . all three species have lost the ndhg c <dig> editing site by substitution with a genomic t , and loss of the editing site may have occurred in a common ancestor. m. esculenta and r. communis are both in the large euphorbiaceae family, and the pairwise dn/ds value between m. esculenta and r. communis crr <dig> genes is  <dig> , indicating strong negative selection of truncated genes. thus, both truncation of crr <dig> and loss of the ndhd c <dig> editing site target have occurred in additional examples in angiosperm evolution, and these truncated crr <dig> genes appear to be maintained under strong negative selection.

selective constraints for ppr domains varies based on differential selection in helix a and helix b motifs
individual ppr domains are proposed to fold into two antiparallel helices  connected by a coil to create a structure with two faces  <cit> . in order to determine variation of selective pressure across the ppr genes, dn/ds was scanned across the gene sequences with a sliding window analysis of  <dig> codons with  <dig> codon increments for crr <dig> and otp <dig>  as well as crr <dig> and the mammalian ppr gene ptcd <dig> . these analyses show that very slowly evolving regions are most frequently located in specific ppr repeats, in the c-terminal region of the e domain, and in most of the dyw domain .

the rates of evolution of each repeat and the c-terminal domains were determined for otp <dig> . repeats r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> were found to have dn/ds values that differed significantly from the entire gene . the dyw domain had the lowest dn/ds value of all domains examined with a value of  <dig>  compared with the gene average of  <dig>  . all pprs had dn/ds values less than  <dig> and are under strong negative selection .

since ppr proteins are thought to be composed of pairs of antiparallel helices  <cit> , dn/ds values were determined for the a helices and b helices of the individual repeats for otp <dig> . the a helices generally exhibit significantly smaller dn/ds values than the gene as a whole, and this is especially notable in helix a of ppr repeats p <dig>  s <dig>  p <dig>  l <dig>  and s <dig> . the third helix of the e domain also had a significantly lower dn/ds value than the mean for the gene . helices that have significantly higher dn/ds values than the entire gene include helix a of l <dig> as well as helix b of s <dig> and helix  <dig> of the e domain .

in order to determine if the difference in selective pressure on helix a and helix b is a general feature of ppr genes, the evolution of a and b helices was compared in the four brassicaceae ppr genes  and three well studied mammalian ppr genes . for each ppr gene, sequences encoding helix a were selected and concatenated into a single sequence alignment file containing only helix a sequences. helix b sequences from the second helix of each ppr repeat were treated similarly. the dn/ds ratio was determined for helix a and helix b sequences for each of the genes surveyed . for six of seven ppr genes examined, helix a is under greater negative selective pressure than helix b .

discussion
ppr gene and target co-evolution
our analyses demonstrate that rna editing constrains both the evolution of a ppr gene responsible for editing as well as the cis-element recognized by the ppr protein. earlier work established that cis-elements in angiosperm chloroplasts recognized by ppr proteins are constrained, and that the loss of an editing requirement by substitution of an edited c with a genomic t relaxed the constraints on cis-element evolution  <cit> . the results of this study extend these observations through comparison of the evolutionary changes in ppr genes when editing sites are maintained or are lost in evolution. ppr genes such as crr <dig> and clb <dig> that have evolved in the context of a homogenous requirement for editing are maintained under strong negative selection and gene architecture is stable.

by contrast, ppr genes such as crr <dig> and otp <dig> have evolved in an environment where the requirement to edit has changed. loss of an editing target has previously been shown to correlate with conversion of crr <dig> into a pseudogene in medicago truncatula <cit> . as a contrasting example, this study has shown that the crr <dig> gene has been maintained intact after a recent editing site loss, as observed in matthiola species. additional examples of editing site loss are observed for the otp <dig> gene, which is required for the conversion of two editing site targets. the otp <dig> gene is maintained under strong negative selection after loss of the ndhb c <dig> editing site by substitution with a genomic t in t. arvensei. tinctoriar. sativusb. oleracea, and b. rapa , presumably because otp <dig> is still required for a second editing activity at ndhg c <dig> in all of these species.

a third consequence of editing site loss is the observation of gene truncation with crr <dig>  the ndhd c <dig> editing site has been lost by substitution with a genomic t in t. arvenseb. vernal. maritima, p. trichocarpar. communis, and m. esculenta. orthologs of crr <dig> are present in all six species, but have truncated c-terminal domains in or near repeat  <dig> or in the middle of the e domain . all known chloroplast ppr proteins that are required for editing site conversion have an intact e domain, and the c-terminal domains of crr <dig> have been shown to be critical for editing functions in a. thaliana <cit> ; thus, there is strong evidence that the e domain is required for a functional editing ppr protein.

we observed at least three independent c-terminal truncations of crr <dig> genes in the brassicaceae, yet these orphaned crr <dig> genes are maintained under strong negative selection. several observations suggest that these truncated crr <dig> genes are not a first step in pseudogene formation. first, the dn/ds values are very small within the coding sequences of the truncated ppr genes, and range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . second, examination of the c-terminal regions beyond the truncation site indicates that these sequences that now comprise the 3’utr have experienced very high levels indels and nucleotide substitutions . this is consistent with a loss of selection in the 3’ utr that was previously maintained as coding sequence. only the 3’utr of the truncated crr <dig> in t. arvense bears recognizable similarity to the c-terminal coding sequences of a. thaliana, and this may reflect a recent truncation event. finally, analysis of crr <dig> genes in sequenced genomes that have a genomic t at ndhd c <dig> demonstrates that crr <dig> truncation is observed in three additional species of the malpighiales, and that these genes are maintained under strong negative selection for what appears to be an extended period of evolution.

the maintenance of ppr genes responsible for editing and the cis-elements of an editing site appear to involve mutual selective pressure on both components. loss of an editing site by c-to-t mutation frequently correlates with pseudogene formation or structural changes in the ppr gene. loss of ppr gene function may result in an unedited c at an editing site.

molecular evolution of ppr motifs reveals differential selective pressure on helix a and helix b motifs
ppr proteins bind rna in a sequence specific manner, and recent molecular phylogenetic and modeling analyses have proposed that residues in and near the a helices may be directly involved in rna binding  <cit> . our analyses demonstrate that selective pressure varies across the gene sequences in four plant ppr genes and two mammalian ppr genes, such that helix a sequences are highly restricted in evolution and that helix b sequences are less constrained. since both the ppr genes and the corresponding cis-elements are under strong negative selection, these results suggest that amino acid residues in the a helices are critical for ppr function. ppr proteins have sequence and predicted secondary structural similarities to the tetratricopeptide repeat  proteins, and individual ppr domains are proposed to fold into a pair of antiparallel helices  connected by a coil to create a structure with two faces   <cit> . thus, helix a amino acid residues may be involved in rna binding or substrate recognition.

recent molecular phylogenetic analyses and protein modeling of ppr genes in a subclass of genes known as restorer of fertility genes  provide an interesting perspective and contrast to these results  <cit> . rf type ppr genes restore fertility to plants that would otherwise exhibit cytoplasmic male sterility   <cit> . the rf type ppr genes function by recognizing novel mitochondrial transcripts that interfere with pollen formation, and the rf genes and mitochondrial transcripts co-evolve in a nuclear-organellar arms race of diversifying selection  <cit> . some amino acid residues in or near helix a sequences in these rf genes are under diversifying  selection, apparently in response to changes in the target rna sequences that may be driven by mutation and recombination. thus, these residues may be directly involved in rna binding.

by contrast, the editing-related ppr genes examined in this study have largely evolved in the presence of stable cis-elements and the corresponding ppr genes are under purifying  selection. in this work, helix a sequences have been shown to be highly constrained, and these results taken together with the molecular phylogenetic analysis of the rf type ppr genes strongly suggest that helix a residues may be involved in rna binding and substrate recognition.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that loss of chloroplast editing sites has several potential outcomes for ppr genes. first, the cognate ppr gene can become a pseudogene. second, no change in the ppr gene may be observed and the ppr gene architecture is under negative selection for an alternate function. third, truncations that remove c-terminal domains occurred independently and in similar regions of the crr <dig> gene in different lineages. the truncated crr <dig> genes are maintained under strong negative selection, and this suggests that they may be maintained for an unrecognized function that is potentially distinct from rna editing.

selective pressure differs between individual ppr repeats and within helix a and helix b regions of the ppr repeats. the a helices are under exceptionally strong negative selection compared to b helices. the increased selection strongly suggests that there is a critical role for residues that comprise the helix a, possibly in binding rna.
