BACKGROUND
genomic alterations of the chromosome 15q11-q <dig> region are associated with two distinct genomic imprinting disorders, prader-willi syndrome  and angelman syndrome   <cit> . pws is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, childhood obesity, hypogonadism, moderate mental retardation, and behavioral problems. the most common molecular defect found in pws patients is a ~6-mb chromosomal deletion of the 15q11-q <dig> region on the paternal chromosome. maternal uniparental disomy  of chromosome  <dig>  microdeletions in a regulatory region known as the imprinting center , and rare chromosome translocations have also been reported for pws patients. it is clear from molecular studies that pws is primarily caused by deficiency of a paternally expressed gene or genes from the 15q11-q <dig> region. however, it remains uncertain as to whether the major phenotypic features are caused by deficiency of one or more than one gene and whether such genes might be protein coding  or noncoding small nucleolar rnas   <cit> . a 2-mb region extending from the centromeric breakpoint  <dig>  to d15s <dig> was initially defined as the pws candidate region  <cit> . attempts to narrow the candidate region by characterizing several rare patients with cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported by several investigators  <cit> . however, a consensus concerning a narrowed critical region has not yet been reached. the controversy may arise from the complex regulation of a large imprinted domain as evidenced by ic mutations that have been reported to disrupt the imprinting process both in humans and in mice  <cit> . alternatively, if pws is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, the individual genes may only contribute to part of the phenotype  <cit> . numerous protein coding genes and non-coding transcripts have been isolated from the pws candidate region. these include snurf-snrpn, ndn, mkrn <dig>  magel <dig>  pwrn <dig>  pwrn <dig>  ipw, par- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig>  c15orf <dig>  and multiple copies of different families of snorna genes  <cit> . all these transcripts except pwrn <dig> are expressed from the paternal chromosome with brain tissue-specific imprinting of pwrn <dig> and c15orf <dig> and therefore were considered as legitimate pws candidate genes. functional studies in mutant mice have suggested that ndn, magel <dig>  or the snorna genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of pws  <cit> . lee et al. also determined the imprinting status of  <dig> transcripts located centromeric/proximal to the ic within the pws candidate region based on an early version of the expressed sequence tag  map and limited human genomic sequence. seven of these transcripts were found to be paternally expressed but lacked protein coding potential  <cit> . chai et al. identified four protein coding genes cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  nipa <dig>  and gcp <dig> in the proximal breakpoint region and established the genomic organization of the region between the two proximal breakpoints   <cit> .

there have been multiple reports over the last decade describing a subset of fragile x syndrome patients who shared overlapping clinical features with pws. these patients were often described as prader-willi-like fragile x syndrome  <cit> . the shared traits include extreme obesity, dysmorphic features, mental retardation and behavior problems. these patients have typical full mutations in the fmr <dig> gene indicating that the primary defect for the pws-like phenotype was dysregulation of fmr <dig>  the specificity of the pws-like clinical features in fragile x syndrome patients has been debated  <cit> .

chromosome  <dig> is one of the seven human chromosomes with a high rate of segmental duplication  <cit> . zody et al. carried out a detailed analysis of the duplication structure and history of chromosome  <dig> and reported that low copy repeats , also termed segmental duplications , in chromosome  <dig> are largely clustered in proximal and distal 15q  <cit> . there are two breakpoints  in the centromeric region and a single common breakpoint  in the telomeric region  <cit> . the remarkable consistency of the breakpoints strongly indicates the presence of a hot spot for recombination. indeed, large genomic lcrs derived from the duplication of the actively transcribed herc <dig> gene and its pseudogenes were identified in the bp <dig> and bp <dig> regions and are believed to contribute to a certain percentage of chromosomal rearrangements between 15q <dig> and 15q <dig>  <cit> . recent reports suggest that herc2-associated lcrs also are present within the bp <dig> region  <cit> . in addition, pujana et al. have described a second cluster of lcrs  with golgin-like protein  genomic sequence in the 15q11-q <dig>  15q <dig>  and 15q <dig> regions  <cit> . locke et al. also characterized the genomic structure and lcrs in the pericentromeric region of chromosome  <dig> proximal to bp <dig>  <cit> .

here we report an updated version of a sequence-based bac contig covering the pws candidate region based on the analysis of the finished version of the human genome sequence , and we question whether the orientation of the bp <dig> to bp <dig> region may be polymorphic in the population. we provide further characterization of four protein coding genes, cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig>  located at the proximal breakpoint of the pws candidate region. golga8e and whdc1l <dig> are two protein coding genes from this region that are represented in genome databases but not previously discussed in the published literature. cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> have been described  <cit>  but we have undertaken further molecular characterization and reported new data regarding their gene structure and complex alternative splicing pattern. in addition, pulsed field gel electrophoresis  analysis of the 15q11-q <dig> region has revealed a highly polymorphic region between bp <dig> and bp <dig> that is consistent with the presence of an abundance of copy number variants  in the region as detected by genome-wide array cgh analysis  <cit> .

RESULTS
sequence-based bac contig covering the chromosome 15q11-q <dig> pws candidate region
in an effort to annotate the 15q11-q <dig> region in detail and identify novel transcripts from the pws candidate region, we first constructed a sequence-based bac contig covering the pws candidate region and then identified numerous overlapping ests and cdna sequences primarily using bioinformatics tools. in the ucsc genome browser   <cit> , there are four super genomic contigs covering the 15q11-q <dig> common deletion interval as diagramed in fig. 1a . there are four sequence gaps between these contigs as diagramed in fig. 1a. the exact size of these gaps is unknown but they are likely to be small based on the previously published data using yac contigs  <cit> . the genomic size of 15q11-q <dig> deduced from the sequence contigs is around  <dig> mb and is larger than the  <dig> mb-extent frequently cited in the literature based on cytogenetic analysis and physical maps generated prior to the availability of the human genome sequence  <cit> . to construct a bac contig covering the region, we first identified individual bac clones using known genes and sequence tag site  markers  <cit> , as well as newly identified sts markers which were integrated into the ucsc genome browser; these were used as bait to search the ncbi high throughput genomic sequence  database  <cit> . the sts map reported by christian et al. provided a scaffold for construction of the bac contig  <cit> . a total of  <dig> minimal overlapping bac clones were identified from a region between bp <dig> and the 5'-end of ube3a, and the accession numbers of overlapping bac clones are listed in additional file  <dig>  the blast  <dig> program  <cit>  was then used to confirm the sequence overlap, and sequence identity > <dig> % was considered to be significant. although this limit was arbitrarily set, it was based on the estimation of the overall error rate of sequence from the human genome sequence project  <cit> . lcrs might have sequences that would fall within this degree of identity. in most regions, the contig shown in fig. 1c is consistent with the genome assembly displayed in multiple databases and other reports  <cit> . however, the orientation of the bac contig around bp <dig> is opposite to that of the contig displayed in the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . the exact orientation of this region remains uncertain and may even be polymorphic in the population. there are still two sequence gaps around the bp <dig> region as diagramed in fig.  <dig> which illustrate the difficulties involved in both experimental manipulation and computational analysis due to the existence of highly identical lcrs within the region.

to further confirm the map position for the individual bac clones assembled using bioinformatics tools, we performed fish  experiments using dna derived from selected individual bac clones from the region as probes. as listed in additional file  <dig>  the localization of  <dig> bac clones to chromosome 15q was confirmed by fish studies . a simplified version of the bac contig with only one bac clone for each position is diagramed in fig. 1c. the order of genes displayed in ucsc/ensembl/ncbi human genome browsers is diagramed in fig. 1b for reference and comparison  <cit> . a much more detailed description of the region including the bac contig, sts markers, cpg islands, and the map positions of novel transcripts is summarized in additional file  <dig> 

characterization of four protein-coding genes from the proximal breakpoint of 15q11-q <dig> pws candidate region
there are numerous ests mapped to this region, but most of them are intronless and/or lack major open reading frames , and their significance cannot be easily addressed because they may function as noncoding rnas or contain potential artifacts from cdna production. in order to identify protein-coding genes, only transcripts with intron-exon structure and greater than 99% sequence identity between the est and the matched genomic sequence were considered significant and are listed in additional file  <dig>  towards this goal, we have analyzed each individual est from this region for coding potential by orf analysis. most of the ests were overlapping and did not have significant coding potential, with the exception of clones  that displayed orfs greater than  <dig> amino acids in length. there were no additional protein-coding genes identified in the region between ndn and snurf-snrpn despite the presence of numerous ests with clear intron-exon structure. in contrast, the region around the proximal breakpoints appears to have a high density of protein-coding genes based on our analysis using bioinformatics tools. to rule out the possibility of artifacts in these est clones, we first performed expression analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  using rna templates isolated from human lymphoblasts and brain tissue. six representative cdna clones  were particularly interesting because of their clear protein-coding potential and readily detectable expression in lymphoblasts and brain tissues by rt-pcr. clones d <dig>  af <dig>  bc <dig>  and bx <dig> were identical to four genes reported by chai et al. which correspond to cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  nipa <dig>  and gcp <dig>  respectively, while bc <dig> and bc <dig> are two protein-coding genes from this region that are predicted genes in the ucsc genome browser, but have not yet been characterized in the published literature. computational analyses of est clones ak <dig>  ak <dig>  and ak <dig> predict significant orfs, but we were not able to detect expression in either lymphoblasts or brain tissues by rt-pcr despite multiple attempts. we were also not able to detect any significant conservation when the sequences were compared to those available for multiple species, which raised a question concerning the functional significance of these est transcripts. there are numerous additional ests within the region which show clear intron-exon structure and perfect sequence identity with the genomic sequence but do not contain significant orfs, and their biological relevance remains to be defined. this analysis also confirmed the transcripts previously reported  <cit> , but numerous additional ests without protein coding potential have since been deposited in the databases and mapped within the interval.

we have performed further analysis for two protein coding genes cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> that have been previously reported by chai et al. there were numerous est and cdna sequences identified by database searching using the cdna clone d <dig> encoding cyfip <dig> that either overlapped, or increased the extent of the sequence at both the 5'- and 3'-ends and additional exons and an elongated 3'-untranslated region  were found. alternatively spliced forms were identified by sequence alignment between the cdna sequence and the genomic sequences. further sequence analysis revealed five variant mrna isoforms resulting from alternative 5'-splicing of the cfyip <dig> gene that appeared to encode four different protein isoforms by orf analysis . isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> potentially encode the same protein with a length of  <dig> amino acids. isoform  <dig> has  <dig> amino acids which is initiated from the most upstream atg codon but skips exon  <dig>  isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> appear to be initiated from two different promoters within introns  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these two isoforms also encode two shorter orfs with a length of  <dig> amino acids for isoform  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids for isoform  <dig>  the mrna transcript for isoform  <dig> has the longest 3'-utr containing five polyadenylation signals . it is not clear how the 5'-utr is connected to the 3'-utr for the different mrna isoforms. isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> appeared to have much longer 3'-utrs when compared to isoforms  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> based on the cdna sequence currently deposited in the databases. therefore, the total length of these cdnas appeared to be similar to the other three isoforms despite lacking numerous 5'-exons. this may explain why there is a single signal from northern blot analysis as shown in fig. 3a. the expression of isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> was confirmed by rt-pcr experiments using isoform-specific primers . interestingly, similar alternative splicing for isoform  <dig> is also found in mice  suggesting a functional significance for the alternative splicing. sequence alignment between the cdna sequence and genomic sequence indicated that cyfip <dig> was comprised of  <dig> exons, and the pattern of alternative splicing and intron-exon junctions is diagramed in fig. 2c and additional file  <dig>  cyfip <dig> spans about  <dig> kb of genomic dna. the cdna sequence and protein isoforms were deposited in genbank . the majority of the 5'-exons mapped within bac 289d <dig>  and a small number of 3'-exons mapped to bac 26f <dig>  to examine the tissue-specific expression pattern of the cyfip <dig> gene, northern blot analyses were performed using a 700-bp cdna fragment generated by rt-pcr that corresponded to the 5'-end of the d <dig> sequence. there was a strongly hybridizing  <dig> -kb transcript seen in all tissues examined indicating that the cdna sequence that we assembled most likely represented the full length of the cyfip <dig> mrna. the single band from northern analysis may represent many different transcripts with very similar size as revealed from computational analysis. cyfip <dig> was expressed ubiquitously in numerous tissues examined . similarly, we have also found five different splicing forms by in silico analysis that result from alternative splicing of the 5'-utr of the nipa <dig> gene but appear to encode the same protein based on orf analysis. the variant nipa <dig> mrna sequences were also deposited in genbank  . an orf with  <dig> amino acids was deduced from the available  <dig> -kb cdna sequence, and nipa <dig> and cyfip <dig> are transcribed towards each other but the transcriptional orientation to the centerome could not be determined definitely because these two genes are mapped within a very polymorphic region discussed in detail below. the intron-exon structures were determined and tabulated in additional file  <dig>  nipa <dig> extends over about  <dig> kb of genomic dna. the physical distance between the stop codons of cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> is only  <dig>  kb and interestingly, the 3'-utr of cyfip <dig> isoform  <dig>  and nipa <dig> overlap .

for est clone bc <dig>  a  <dig>  kb-cdna sequence was assembled after analysis of sequence homology with numerous overlapping est clones. the expression of the transcript was confirmed by performing rt-pcr and sequencing the resulting product . there are  <dig> exons based on the sequence alignment between the cdna and genomic dna and the intron-exon structure is summarized in table  <dig>  orf analysis indicated that the cdna bc <dig> putatively encodes a protein  <dig> amino acids in length. the amino acid sequence is identical to the sequence of golgi autoantigen, golgin subfamily a, 8e  deposited in the database . the golga8e gene spans about  <dig> kb of genomic dna and the transcriptional direction could not be determined definitely because of association with lcrs in the region. expression of this gene is readily detectable in lymphoblasts and brain tissues by both rt-pcr  and northern blot analysis with a predominant 6-kb transcript and a weaker 4-kb transcript as shown in fig. 3i and 3j. computational analysis also revealed two alternatively spliced forms for golga8e as diagramed in fig. 2e. isoform  <dig> has an orf of  <dig> amino acids and isoform  <dig> has an orf of  <dig> amino acids. we have sequenced and confirmed part of the rt-pcr products and the annotated sequence for both isoforms has been deposited in the database. protein database searching identified five other golgin subfamily genes within the 15q11-q <dig> and 15q24-q <dig> regions with identity of amino acid sequence ranging between 48–97% . however, protein searching for a conserved domain did not identify a coiled-coil domain that is believed to be characteristic for members of the golgin subfamily despite overall strong similarity to other golgin subfamily members.

* indicates multiple isoforms for this protein but only one is shown in table, # the nucleotide position is referred to ucsc browser human genome build  <dig>  and mouse genome build  <dig>  aa, amino acid. iden% of aa is the percentage of identity of amino acids for each gene deduced from blast  <dig> program when against to golga8e. the 'n' indicates no significant sequence identity. ¶af <dig> is referred as golgi autoantigen, golgin subfamily a2-like protein.

using an approach similar to that described above, we also assembled a novel  <dig> -kb cdna sequence from cdna clones  and numerous overlapping est sequences. the cdna of bc <dig> is located  <dig> kb distal to golga8e and has multiple alternative mrna forms. these different mrna isoforms are associated with numerous orfs, ranging in size from  <dig> amino acids to  <dig> amino acids based on computational analysis. the longest orf has high similarity  to a portion of the mouse whdc <dig> protein  and thus was named whdc1l <dig> . comparison of the cdna and genomic dna sequences indicate that there are  <dig> exons, and two alternatively spliced forms with orfs >  <dig> amino acids were identified and characterized in detail by sequence alignment between the cdna and genomic sequences. we have confirmed the expression of this transcript in lympoblasts by rt-pcr  and northern blot analysis . the intron-exon junctions and gene structure are summarized in table  <dig> and alternative isoforms are diagramed in fig. 2f. isoform  <dig> has an orf of  <dig> amino acids and isoform  <dig> has an orf of  <dig> amino acids. we have resequenced some of the rt-pcr products and the annotated sequences for both isoforms were deposited in the database . a protein database search revealed high identity  to the middle part of hypothetical proteins  encoded by two human cdna clones . the kiaa <dig> protein encoded by ak <dig> is weakly similar to human jmy , a p <dig> cofactor involved in the regulation of the p <dig> response  <cit>  and its mouse homolog named whdc <dig> . interestingly, ak <dig> has been mapped to the 15q <dig> region while whdc <dig> is located in a region homologous to human chromosome 15q <dig> in the central part of mouse chromosome  <dig>  the possibility that the bc048987/bc <dig> sequences found in the 15q <dig> region are part of a processed ak <dig> pseudogene was ruled out by rt-pcr experiments using primers unique to the bc <dig> sequence .

golga8e associated lcr in 15q and other chromosomal regions
blastn searching of human genome sequence databases using the golga8e cdna as bait revealed numerous sequences with significant similarity across the 15q11-q <dig> and 15q24-q <dig> regions and sequence identities range from 91–97% at the nucleotide level as summarized in additional file  <dig>  there are also additional copies of sequence with sequence identity ranging from 50–89% that may represent different golgin subfamily genes in the 15q region . blast searching also identified  <dig> bac clones from chromosome  <dig> , one bac clone from chromosome  <dig> , and one bac clone from chromosome  <dig>  with sequence identity ranging from 90–97% compared to golga8e. careful sequence analysis revealed that the copy at genomic location chr15q11:20986537– <dig> bp  proximal to the cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> genes showed the highest identity to the genomic golga8e dna sequence providing evidence that the copy at this genomic position is actively transcribed. the rest of the copies distributed within the 15q11-q <dig>  15q24-q <dig>  and other chromosomal regions are likely to be part of lcrs but the possibility of additional transcribed copies in other regions or an error in map position cannot be completely ruled out. there are five additional golgin subfamily genes mapped within the 15q13-q <dig> and 15q24-q <dig> regions. they are golga, golga <dig>  golga8a, golga8b, and golga8g. the map position and genomic location of these golgin subfamily genes in ncbi build  <dig>  are shown in table  <dig>  these results further support the initial characterization of lcr <dig> by pujana et al. suggesting the presence of a new cluster of golgin like protein  sequence-associated lcrs in this region  <cit> . we have provided further evidence that multiple actively transcribed golgin subfamily genes are associated with lcrs in the 15q region. the distribution of golgin subfamily genes associated with lcrs in the 15q11-q <dig> region suggests that these lcrs may contribute to the frequent long-range chromosomal rearrangements between the 15q <dig> region and the 15q24-q <dig> region reported in the literature  <cit> .

mapping of cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig> to the proximal deletion breakpoint of the pws/as common deletion interval
christian et al. reported that the order of several known sts markers relative to the centromere from microsatellite marker analysis was as follows: centromere-bp1-ac02b45-d15s912-d15s18-d15s541-d15s542-bp2-telomere  <cit> . it was suggested that the class i breakpoint mapped centromeric to d15s541/d15s <dig> and the class ii deletion breakpoint was telomeric to d15s541/d15s <dig> based on the analysis of microsatellite markers in a large series of pws/as patients  <cit> . sequence alignment between sts markers and the genomic sequence of bac clones covering the region revealed that bac 289d <dig>  contained d15s <dig>  d15s <dig>  and d15s <dig>  while d <dig> and a002b <dig> mapped within bac 26f <dig> . in addition, d15s <dig> and d15s <dig> were found to map within cyfip <dig> intron  <dig>  the overlap between bac 26f <dig> and bac 289d <dig> revealed by sequence analysis was confirmed by southern blot analysis using the insert of d <dig> as a probe to hybridize to genomic dna isolated from both bac clones and digested with the restriction enzyme ecori . to determine whether cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> were deleted in pws/as patients known to have large deletions of chromosome 15q11-q <dig>  we performed fish experiments on two pws  and three as patients  using the bac clones  where cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> were identified  and three as patients  are shown). these patients were known to have large chromosomal deletions of 15q11-q <dig> based on previous studies. both bac 26f <dig> and bac 289d <dig> were detected as red signals on chromosome  <dig> when a centromere-specific probe from a commercial source was detected as a green signal. as shown in fig.  <dig>  only one red signal from the bac 289d <dig> probe was detected in patient pws- <dig>  and two as patients  indicating a deletion of bac 289d <dig> in these three patients who are likely to have a class i deletion. two signals for the bac 289d <dig> probe were present in patients as- <dig>  and pws- <dig>  indicating that this bac was not deleted. this is in agreement with a previous report that these patients have class ii deletions  <cit> . for the bac 26f <dig> probe, no signal or an extremely weak signal was visualized for patient pws- <dig>  and two as patients  ; all three patients were also deleted for bac 289d <dig> by fish. however, a very dim red signal from bac 26f <dig> was apparent when images of red and green signals were analyzed separately . this result suggests a possibility of partial deletion of 26f <dig> but the inherent limitations of fish as a method for quantitation should also be considered. this result suggests that bac 26f <dig> was likely to map centromeric to bac 289d <dig> and bac 26f <dig> was partially deleted in the as/pws patients analyzed. this observation is in agreement with the results reported by pujana et al. using the same probes for fish experiments, by others using array cgh, as well as the most recent data reported by markoff and flomen  <cit> . because it was known from microsatellite analysis that these pws/as patients  had class i deletions, we used the d <dig> and nipa <dig> inserts as probes to hybridize to dna from these patients for southern blot analysis. the dosage effect due to the deletion was revealed from genomic dna southern analysis but no abnormal junction fragments were detected  indicating that the breakpoint is less likely to be within the cyfip <dig> gene. the difficulty in identifying unique genomic probes from the breakpoint region precluded additional analysis such as multiple color interphase fish to delineate the order of bac clones within the bp <dig> region.

imprinting analysis for cyfip <dig> and nipa2
to examine whether imprinted expression is associated with cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig>  rna from cultured lymphoblasts derived from pws patients with class i and class ii deletions was used as a template for rt-pcr analysis. the expression of golga8e and whdc1l <dig> was also included in the analysis, but we were aware that it is probably impossible to determine the imprinting status for golga8e and whdc1li in humans because of the presence of highly similar copies of these two genes within the region of 15q. the expression of cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig> was readily detectable in cultured lymphoblasts from pws class i and ii patients by rt-pcr analysis . to further examine the possibility of quantitative or leaky imprinted expression for cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig>  we also used total rna derived from lymphoblasts from pws patients with class i or class ii deletions, and from normal control individuals for northern blot analysis. as shown in fig. 5a and 5h, there was no significant difference in expression between patients with paternal deletions and normal controls for cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig>  the decreased expression of cyfip <dig> in class i deletion patients when compared to class ii deletion patients is consistent with the conclusion that expression is not subject to imprinting. we then attempted to examine whether cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig> display a tissue-specific imprinting pattern particularly in brain as reported for other genes in the 15q11-q <dig> region including ube3a and atp10a  <cit> . we have obtained two brain tissues  from the university of maryland brain bank from individuals for whom a pws diagnosis was initially made based on the clinical description. molecular studies on these two cases were performed in the lab after we obtained the tissues. both cases have abnormal dna methylation at the noti site within the snrpn cpg island by genomic dna southern blot analysis  which supports the clinical diagnosis of pws  <cit> . in addition, array cgh analysis revealed a class ii deletion in the case of pws- <dig> but no apparent deletion of 15q11-q <dig> was detected in the case of pws- <dig> which supports the possibility of maternal upd of chromosome  <dig> or a rare imprinting mutation in the case of pws- <dig> . a similar conclusion was also reported by others  <cit> . we first examined the expression of snrpn in these two patients as shown in fig. 5k. the results of these experiments indicated that the snrpn transcript was not detectable by rt-pcr which is consistent with the abnormal dna methylation found at the snrpn cpg island and again supports the diagnosis of pws. we then examined the expression of cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig> in these two patients and transcripts from these four genes were detected by rt-pcr as shown in fig. 5i, j, m, and 5n. the reduced intensity of the cyfip <dig> pcr products in case pws- <dig> may reflect the quality of the rnas isolated from archival tissues. analysis of gene expression by northern blot analysis in brain tissues was attempted but was not successful due to the poor quality of the rna isolated from autopsy brain tissues. we have also examined the expression of cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig> using rnas derived from lymphoblast cell lines from as patients with a class i deletion and no evidence of allele-specific expression was found . these data together with the results from deletion analysis support the conclusion that cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> are not subject to imprinting in cultured lymphoblasts and brain tissues. these results are in agreement with those reported by chai et al.  <cit>  but a more complicated imprinting pattern such as cell type- or developmental stage-specific imprinting cannot be completely ruled out. because of the presence of highly homologous sequences for golga8e and whdc1l <dig> in the 15q region, we were not able to determine whether golga8e and whdc1l <dig> have imprinted or biallelic expression.

dna methylation of cpg islands of cyfip <dig> and nipa2
allele-specific differential methylation has been found consistently for multiple loci within the 15q11-q <dig> region where the paternal allele was usually unmethylated while the maternal allele was methylated. as described in the previous section, cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> are localized within the common deletion interval described for pws/as patients but most likely lie at the most centromeric end of an imprinted domain within 15q11-q <dig>  we have identified typical cpg islands in the 5'-region of the cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig> genes by computational analysis, and a detailed map of methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sites was deduced . to examine whether allele-specific differential dna methylation was associated with the cyf1p <dig> cpg island, a dna probe generated by pcr amplification of genomic dna was used for southern blot analysis after digestion with bsshii in combination with hindiii. no allele-specific methylation was found after digestion of genomic dna derived from any tissues examined, including several sub-regions of the brain and various cell lines, and both alleles appear to be completely unmethylated . a similar result was also obtained for the nipa <dig> cpg island where both alleles are also unmethylated . however, we were not able to generate unique probes for genomic dna southern analysis for the golga8e and whdc1l <dig> cpg islands because of associated lcrs in the region.

pulse field gel electrophoresis  analysis of 15q11-q <dig> region
the difficulty of generating unique probes for fish analysis in the bp <dig> region prompted us to perform pfge analysis to delineate the genomic structure for the bp <dig> region. a total of  <dig> noti sites were identified between the bp <dig> and bp <dig> regions by computational analysis. the distribution of these noti sites, the known genes associated with the noti sites, and the bac clones containing these noti sites are diagramed in fig. 6a. we then performed pfge analysis using noti and  <dig> different genomic probes generated from the 15q11-q <dig> region. the map position of  <dig> genomic probes is diagramed in fig. 6a. these genomic probes except p <dig> were generated by pcr amplification from genomic dnas and are located close to the cpg island of cyfip <dig> , the 3'-end of the ube3a gene , the cpg island of atp10a , and the cpg island of the p locus for albinism. the p <dig> probe is a previously reported cdna clone named dn <dig> which represents part of the mkrn <dig> cdna sequence . the noti sites associated with the snurf-snrpn and mkrn <dig> cpg islands are known to be differentially methylated with the paternal allele unmethylated and the maternal allele methylated  <cit> . the noti site associated with c15orf  <dig>  was reported to be methylated on both alleles with a possibility of tissue-specific differences  <cit> . in contrast, the noti sites associated with the ube3a cpg island have been previously reported to be unmethylated for both alleles  <cit> . the results of the pfge analysis using these probes are shown in fig. 6b and 6c. the patterns revealed by using probes from the mkrn <dig>  and 3'-ube3a  regions to analyze dna derived from pws and as patients with large deletions are consistent with the results reported in the literature indicating differential methylation of noti sites  in these regions  in which the paternal allele is unmethylated and the maternal allele is methylated  <cit> . the lower band shown in fig. 6b <dig> represents the genomic fragment  from the paternal chromosome between the snrpn cpg island and the ube3a cpg island. the appearance of two closely migrating bands in the pws sample when hybridized with the p <dig> probe suggests the presence of a genomic copy number variant proximal to mkrn <dig> and probably within the bp <dig> region . a faint band in one of the as samples may suggest a similar copy number variant or the possibility of incomplete restriction enzyme digestion. we have analyzed dna from more than  <dig> anonymous normal individuals collected as part of the polymorphism project at baylor, and representative data are shown in fig. 6c1– <dig>  there is no significant variation revealed using the p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> probes in these individuals examined. however, extensive variation was revealed by using probes p <dig> and p <dig> among normal individuals. the pattern revealed by the p <dig> probe is somewhat surprising because of the known herc2-associated lcr in the region. we were not able to discern the pattern and identity of each band by pfge analysis because of the inability to generate a detailed physical map for the region due to the sequence gaps and the presence of the extensive lcrs in the region. further analysis using different restriction enzymes and additional probes may help to delineate the genomic structure of the region but will still be challenging due to the presence of lcrs.

cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  and golga8e are members of different protein families
the functions of cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  golga8e, and whdc1l <dig> in mammals are unknown. to determine whether the cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> proteins contain any functionally relevant or conserved protein motifs or domains, we carried out protein database searching  and protein motif and structural analysis   <cit> . no conserved domain or motif was identified from this analysis. however, the protein structural analysis did reveal the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> transmembrane domains, respectively, for cyf1p <dig> and nipa <dig>  to examine the cross-species conservation for the cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> proteins, the cdna sequences and their predicted amino acid sequences were compared to multiple nucleotide and protein databases using the blastn and blastp programs  <cit> . multiple significant sequence matches from other spcies including mouse, drosophila, c. elegans, pig, fugu, arabidopsis, and anopheles gambiae were identified and are diagramed in additional file  <dig> for cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig>  respectively. a human protein pir <dig> was also identified that shows high similarity to cyfip <dig> and was named cyfip <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a variety of hypothetical proteins from c. elegans, drosophila, and many other species were also identified for cyfip <dig>  golga8e has significant similarity to many golgin subfamilies at the nucleotide and amino acid levels . however, the protein structural analysis did not reveal a characteristic coiled-coil domain for golga8e. there are total of  <dig> golgin subfamily genes found in the human genome and  <dig> of them are mapped to the proximal 15q region . golga8e has much higher similarity to the subfamily mapped in the 15q region than other subfamily genes in other chromosomal loci. in addition, there is no immediate evidence of evolutionary conservation in the mouse and other species for golga8e despite the fact that several of its other family members appear to be highly conserved in mice .

discussion
in an attempt to identify novel transcripts from the pws candidate region, we have constructed a sequence-based bac contig covering the ~2-mb pws candidate region. when compared to the previously published bac/yac contig covering the region of interest  <cit> , we believe that this version of the bac contig contributes significantly to the understanding of the physical map of the 15q11-q <dig> pws candidate region. the current version of the map reported here is largely consistent with the maps reported by several other groups using the array cgh technique  <cit> . there are two sequence gaps remaining in the region around the proximal common pws/as deletion breakpoints  in the sequence assembly available in the public domain. there are still three sequence gaps within the 6-mb region, and closing these gaps has been challenging because of the extremely high sequence identity between different copies of lcrs. makoff and flomen recently reported closure of these gaps by an extensive bioinformatic approach  <cit> . the orientation of the contig drawn from this analysis differs from the contig displayed in the ucsc genome browser   <cit>  in which bac 289d <dig> was positioned centromeric to bac 26f <dig> but is consistent with multiple reports  <cit> . the apparent discrepancy between the two genomic contigs may reflect an artifact introduced by using computational methodology because of the high sequence identity among the different lcrs or other aspects of the complex genome organization in the region. the structure depicted in the genome browsers is an attempt to select one unique order and copy number from data derived from two different chromosomes from multiple individuals, while the chromosomes may have a polymorphic gene order and copy number. this hypothesis is supported by a report that 9% of individuals in the general population have an inversion of the 15q11-q <dig> region  <cit> , by the results from pfge analysis reported in this study, as well as by the array cgh technique reported in the database of genomic variants  <cit> . our experience in utilizing the human genome sequence also emphasizes the importance of evaluating human genome sequence data in detail for a particular genomic region of interest before making any conclusion.

we have characterized transcripts for the first time for two protein-coding genes golga8e and whdc1l <dig> in addition to four other genes cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  nipa <dig>  and gcp <dig> previously described  <cit>  from a region close to the proximal breakpoint  of the pws candidate region. our results for cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> are largely in agreement with the previous report  <cit> . however, we have provided additional information regarding the genomic structure, alternative splicing, and expression pattern for both genes. these findings would be very important for understanding the function of cyfip <dig> and its interaction with fmrp and rac <dig> because isoforms  <dig> and  <dig> apparently lack the n-terminal fmrp and rac <dig> interacting domain  <cit> . golga8e and whdc1l <dig> are associated with a large number of lcrs within the 15q11-q <dig> and 15q24-q <dig> regions. the function of golga8e and whdc1l <dig> is unknown. golga8e belongs to the golgin subfamily which was originally identified as a group of golgi-localized autoantigens recognized by sera from patients with a variety of autoimmune conditions  <cit> . there are l <dig> putative golgin subfamily genes in the human genome, but some of them have not yet been confirmed experimentally. these golgin subfamily members are differentiated mostly on the basis of molecular weight  <cit> . the function of most of golgin subfamily genes remains unclear, but a role for golgins in association with a gtpase protein complex in the organization and regulation of golgi membrane trafficking has been suggested  <cit> . the presence of  <dig> out  <dig> golgin subfamily genes in the 15q11-q <dig> and 15q24-q <dig> regions is of interest relative to the possibility of actively transcribed genes with lcrs and the occurrence of lcr-mediated chromosomal rearrangements in the region. the golgin subfamily genes in 15q share higher similarity to golga8e than other subfamily members on other chromosomes. thus, golgin subfamily genes in 15q may have a common ancestry, and the sds in the region may have played a role in the formation of new gene family members through evolution.

although it is possible that cyfip1and nipa <dig> as well as golga8e and whdc1l <dig> may all be deleted in class i pws patients, these four genes do not appear to be strong candidates for a primary role in the pws phenotype. our expression analysis using rna isolated from the cultured lymphoblasts of pws patients carrying class i deletions and brain tissues from patients with maternal upd  <dig> suggest that cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> are not subject to genomic imprinting. the possibility of cell type or developmental stage-specific imprinting cannot be completely ruled out but is less likely. in addition, a possibility that the paternal allele is more active was suggested by a recent study of the expression profile of cyfip <dig>  nipa <dig>  nipa <dig>  and gcp <dig> in class i and class ii deletion patients using real time rt-pcr methods, but more study is needed to make a definitive conclusion  <cit> . it is impossible to analyze genomic imprinting for golga8e and whdc1l <dig> with high confidence because of multiple copies, some of which are distant from the bp1-bp <dig> region. several recent reports comparing patients with class i and class ii deletions have suggested that there are phenotypic differences between the two groups  <cit> , while another investigator did not observe such distinctions  <cit> . butler et al. recently found that pws patients with class i deletions have a more severe phenotype than those with either a class ii deletion or maternal upd using a variety of psychological and behavioral tests  <cit> . similarly, as patients with class i deletions showed complete absence of vocalization while some as patients with class ii deletions were able to pronounce syllabic sounds  <cit> . these studies suggest that the deletion of biallelically expressed genes located between bp <dig> and bp <dig> such as cyfip <dig> may have an impact on the degree of impairment particularly in communication and behavior observed for both pws and as patients.

mapping of the cyfip <dig> gene encoding an fmrp interacting protein within the pws candidate region is of particular relevance for the analysis of the prader-willi-like phenotype observed in fragile x patients with full mutations in fmr <dig>  the significance of the overlapping clinical features between pws and fragile x syndrome remains uncertain, and it is very difficult to determine whether there is any intrinsic link underlying these overlapping clinical features solely from a clinical standpoint. several recent studies report that autistic spectrum disorder is more prevalent in pws patients than was previously thought  <cit> . the identification of cyfip <dig> in the pws candidate region may provide a molecular framework for further investigation, particularly in the area of shared autistic behavior between fragile x and prader-willi syndromes. indeed, alteration of cyfip <dig> in pws-like fragile x syndrome patients was recently reported which provides a molecular basis for the clinical observation  <cit> . altered expression of cyfip <dig> has also been reported both in autism patients with maternal duplication of 15q11-q <dig> and in fragile x syndrome patients with autistic features  <cit> .

characterization of additional golga8e lcrs around the bp <dig>  bp <dig>  and bp <dig> regions has added another layer of complexity in an already complicated region. the presence of an additional lcr  other than herc2-associated lcrs was first suggested by pujana et al.  <cit>  with the suggestion that golgin-like sequences are associated with lcr <dig>  with the finished version of the human genome sequence, we were able to characterize the genomic organization and copy number of these lcrs in substantial detail. like the herc2-associated lcrs, this new class of lcr is associated with an actively transcribed copy of golga8e. the golga8e-associated lcrs have wider genomic distribution and are found in the 15q <dig>  q <dig>  q <dig>  and q <dig>  and other chromosomal regions while herc2-associated lcrs are found in 15q <dig> and q <dig> and other chromosomes  <cit> . the finding of golga8e-associated lcrs in the 15q <dig>  q <dig>  and q24-q <dig> regions suggests that these lcrs could be responsible for longer chromosomal rearrangements observed between the 15q <dig> and q24-q <dig> regions  <cit> . the degree of polymorphism in the bp <dig> and bp <dig> regions revealed by pfge analysis is consistent with the data from multiple genome-wide analyses of cnvs by array cgh displayed in the database of genomic variants or in other recent reports  <cit> . there are  <dig> different genomic variants listed in the region proximal to bp <dig> and most of these variants are sds, but there are two inversion variants between bp <dig> and bp <dig>  and one inversion variant between bp <dig> and bp <dig> was previously reported  <cit> . murthy et al. recently reported a 250-kb heterozygous microdeletion covering the cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> genes in the region between bp <dig> and bp <dig> in a male patient with mental retardation  <cit> . the interpretation of the finding is complicated because the same deletion was also present in the patient's father who may have had some mild phenotypic abnormalities. butler et al. reported a pws case with a typical class ii deletion who also had a small duplication between bp <dig> and bp <dig>  and the duplication was present in the healthy father and his brother  <cit> . we have observed that bac 289d <dig> in the bp <dig> region detects a very frequent cnv in the cases referred for clinical array cgh analysis at baylor college of medicine . in most of the cases, similar duplications were also found in one of the healthy parents and/or normal siblings. clearly this is a highly polymorphic region. very extensive investigations in normal individuals and in extended family members of patients with copy number gains or losses will be needed to determine if variations in this region sometimes cause abnormal phenotypes. serious genotype/phenotype analysis for this region will require intensive copy number analysis at high resolution such as pfge or fiber fish to determine not only copy number but also orientation , and perhaps even expression and epigenetic analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed and characterized a sequence-based bac contig covering the pws candidate region using human genome sequence databases. we have characterized transcripts for the first time for two protein-coding genes, golga8e  and whdc1l <dig>  and have further characterized two previously reported genes, cyf1p <dig> and nipa2; all four genes are in the region close to the proximal/centromeric deletion breakpoint . golga8e belongs to the golgin subfamily of coiled-coil domain proteins associated with the golgi apparatus. whdc1l <dig> is a novel gene with similarity to mouse whdc <dig>  and human jmy protein . biallelic expression of cyfip <dig> and nipa <dig> in cultured lymphoblasts and brain tissues analyzed suggests that they are unlikely to be major contributors to the pathogenesis of pws, but haploinsufficiency may contribute to a more prominent behavioral phenotype seen in pws and angelman syndrome  patients with class i deletions as compared to those with class ii deletions. we have also characterized a new class of golga8e-asssociated lcr in the 15q11-q <dig> and q24-q <dig> region. this class of lcr together with herc2-assocaited lcrs may contribute to the frequent chromosomal rearrangements of 15q11-q <dig> and q24-q <dig> reported in the literature. this is one of the most polymorphic regions of the human genome in terms of copy number variation and gene organization, and perhaps the single most polymorphic region of this type.
