BACKGROUND
equine sarcoids are locally invasive, fibroblastic benign skin tumors and represent the most common skin tumor in equidae worldwide  <cit> . they can occur as single lesion, or, more commonly, as multiple lesions, frequently at sites of previous injury and scarring; although they can develop anywhere on the integument sites of predilection are in particular the paragenital region, the thorax–abdomen and the head  <cit> . equine sarcoids rarely regress, are notoriously difficult to treat and are associated with a high recurrence rate following surgical intervention ; these features are likely due to the invasiveness of sarcoid fibroblasts   <cit> . bpv- <dig> and less commonly bpv- <dig> are widely recognized as the causative agents of the disease. although the viral etiology, the biology, the morphology and the epidemiology of equine sarcoids are known  <cit> , the pathogenic events leading to the development of tumour and the mechanisms used by bpv to induce the tumour are less understood. sarcoid formation is known as one of the main long-term complications in the wound healing of horses  <cit> . we hypothesized that in healthy genetically predisposed horses, bpv-1/bpv <dig> may be responsible for abnormal fibroblast proliferation on one hand, and on the other for alterations in dynamics of the extracellular matrix  and its main components . these changes could induce an alteration of the wound healing process and may therefore be an important factor in the pathogenesis of equine sarcoids. the hypothesis that cancer may be “a wound that won’t heal” has been supported by numerous studies  suggesting that wound healing and tumorigenesis share consistently similarities in terms of histological features and signaling molecules; those are among others matrix metalloproteinases , a family of at least  <dig> zinc-dependent endopeptidases, and their inhibitors  all essentially capable of degrading extracellular matrix , including collagen. besides participating in normal connective tissue homeostasis and remodeling, mmps activity is involved in remodeling of ecm and the migration of numerous cell types during various pathological conditions, such as wound healing, keloid formation, chronic inflammatory diseases, and as well as in tumour invasion . in this study, we speculate that changes of the expression levels and of the enzymatic activity of mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and timp- <dig> may play an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoids, being responsible for ecm turnover. of the growing family of mmps, mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>  are unique for their fibronectin-like collagen binding domains and are responsible of degradation of type iv collagen in the basement membranes and in fibrillar collagens, which are essential features of tissue repair and remodeling processes. their activity is controlled by a group of protein inhibitors, the timps. mmp- <dig> is a trans-membrane protease, capable of degrading different ecm components such as collagen types i, ii, and iii, as well as fibronectin and laminin  <cit> . the main interest in this enzyme is due to its ability to activate different proteases, particularly mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  <cit> . recently, yuan et al.   <cit>  have shown that bpv- <dig> induce overexpression of mmps contributing to invasiveness of sfs in vitro. our in vivo study aimed at gaining new insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms of equine sarcoids, by employing immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to investigate their histological features, as well as the expression of type i and type iii collagen, mmp- <dig>  mmmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and their inhibitors, such as timp- <dig>  moreover, the enzymatic activities of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were quantified by gelatin-zymography of the same homogenized tumour tissues.

RESULTS
histological features
examined sarcoids showed the typical histological changes in their epidermal  and dermal component such as hyperkeratosis and epidermal hyperplasia often accompanied by rete pegs extending deep into the proliferating dermal connective tissue. dermal proliferation consisted of tightly whirling plump spindle cells, proliferating in an ecm which appeared more developed than normal. the superficial dermal fibroblasts were usually oriented perpendicular to the basilar epidermal layer in a ‘picket fence’ pattern . ulceration as well as inflammation  were commonly seen. van gieson’s stain of sarcoids confirmed an increase in the amount of deep red color collagen fibers in the dermis, identified as mature collagen , compared with pink color collagen fibers, identified as immature collagen  , as compared to normal skin.fig.  <dig>

normal skin
all normal skin samples showed positive immunostaing for type i and iii collagen, which was light brown stained with a widely distributed staining pattern within the dermal layer. moreover, a weak and finely granular cytoplasmic mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> reactivity was observed in the epidermis. timp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> immunoexpression was present in the epidermis but also in vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cells and fibroblastic cells.

sarcoid samples
type i and type iii collagen appeared as fine discontinuous individual fibers in a loose network, and showed a moderate immunosignal in 36 % of sarcoid samples . type i collagen staining was stronger than type iii collagen in the remaining samples . in 80 % of sarcoids, sfs were strongly positive for vimentin and negative for α-sma; in the remaining samples , 70–80 % of sfs were labeled for vimentin  and approximately 20–30 % were strongly labeled for α-sma . furthermore, sarcoid specimens showed a variable  and finely granular staining pattern for mmp- <dig> in 30–50 % of sfs, as well as in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells . sarcoids featured a weak  to moderate  staining for mmp- <dig>  which appeared highly and finely granular in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells and rarely  in the rete peg epithelium. a moderate to strong cytoplasmic staining for mmp- <dig> was observed in 30–70 % of sfs, inflammatory cells and vascular endothelial cells . timp- <dig> showed extensive and strong cytoplasmic positivity in epidermal cells and in 50–70 % of sfs in almost every sample  . in all tumors, mmp- <dig> expression was observed in epidermis and in 50–70 % of sfs, with variable  cytoplasmic immunolabelling .fig.  <dig>

biochemical analysis
to further confirm our findings, six sarcoid samples, which were available for biochemical analysis and two skin samples from healthy horses were subjected to western blot analysis. hela cell line was also analyzed as positive control for the antibodies used . the anti-collagen i and anti-collagen iii antibodies yielded a band of the expected molecular weight in the neoplastic tissues and normal skin. an increase in the amount of both collagen type protein levels in all tumour samples compared with normal skin was observed, albeit in different amounts among the samples . the analysis of mmp- <dig> showed that 50 % of sarcoid samples  had a high level of protein, above all in its active  form . in addition, an increase in the expression level of mmp <dig> in all tumour samples versus healthy skin samples was observed. the sarcoids showed the overexpression of the cleaved form of mmp <dig>  the  <dig> kda active species which was an autocatalytic product of the 82kda pre-form. we analyzed the expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig>  in order to evaluate their involvement in mmp <dig> activity. there was no significant up-regulation of mmp <dig> protein in the sarcoids compared to normal skin samples, even if in one sarcoid sample  it was present at a very high level. timp <dig> was overexpressed in sarcoids when compared to normal skin. actin was shown as control for ensuring the equal loading of protein extracts . finally, we examined gelatinase mmp’s activity in sarcoid tumors using zymography, which has been extensively used to detect both latent and active form of mmps. gelatine zymography was employed to specifically detect mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> protease activity. as shown in fig.  <dig>  all the examined sarcoids expressed the pro- and active form of mmp <dig>  however, sarcoids showed higher expression levels than normal skin samples. in addition, the mmp <dig> was present in the activated form in all the analyzed sarcoids. interestingly, four out of six the sarcoid samples  overexpressed a cleaved form of 35 kda mmp <dig>  thus demonstrating the strong activity of mmp <dig> during sarcoids tumorigenesis.fig.  <dig> collagen type i and type iii protein expression in equine sarcoids  and normal skin . collagen type iii are expressed in higher amount in sarcoids  when compared to normal skin samples . actin protein levels confirm the amount of protein loading in each lane

discussion
sarcoids are the most common equine skin tumours, characterized by neoplastic fibroblasts intermingled in a collagenous stroma, frequently associated to epidermal hyperplasia  <cit> . bpv-1/bpv- <dig> are believed to be the causative agent of equine sarcoid. this is based on the fact that: 1) bpv-1/- <dig> dna is detected in the majority of sarcoid tumors ; 2) bpv genes are expressed in sarcoids ; 3) experimental inoculation of equine skin with bpv induces sarcoid-like lesions in horses  <cit> ; 4) bpv-  <dig> dna can transform primary equine fibroblasts in vitro  <cit> . interestingly, bpv dna presence has also been reported in normal skin and the virus has been found to be transcriptionally active in some cases of equine inflammatory skin lesions  <cit> . it is noteworthy that very recently bpv has been found also in exuberant granulation tissue  <cit> . it is widely accepted that equine sarcoids may develop subsequently to injury and scarring in genetically predisposed equines  <cit> . for this reason we hypotized that latent bpv infection may be reactivated by chronic physical trauma, leading to development of a form of pathologic wound healing ; thus, the scar producing process may be altered during the maturation phase of wound healing allowing transformation of scar tissue  into sarcoids.

in fact, our immunohistochemical results showed that, in most sarcoids , fibroblasts represented the principal cellular population, the remainder was composed of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.

furthermore, in our sample tissues collagen content was elevated and disorganized when compared to normal skin and, in contrast to what williams et al. reported  <cit> , the ratio of type i  to type iii collagen  seemed to be slightly higher, which was as also demonstrated by van gieson stain. also, and in line with the immunohistochemical results, western blotting analysis confirmed that collagen i and iii were present in higher amounts in tumour samples when compared to normal skin samples. it is known tissue of normal wound repair contains primarily type iii collagen with abundant myofibroblasts. in contrast, abnormal wound repair tissue, , consists of type i and iii bundles with few myofibroblasts  <cit> . combining these data strongly suggests that these sarcoid tumours actually originate in abnormal wound repair tissue  <cit> .

we hypothesized that the basic mechanism for the development of equine sarcoids could be an imbalance of ecm deposition and degradation as seen also during pathologic wound healing.

this process is mediated by ecm degrading enzymes, such as mmps, and we believe that these changes are likely the result of altered expression levels between these enzymes and their inhibitors . the mmps are usually not detectable or at very low levels in healthy resting tissue and are instead induced in wound repair and in keloid formation in response to cytokines, growth factors and/or cell contact with ecm . it has been shown that the over-expression and activation of mmps is induced by bpv oncoproteins in equine sarcoid fibroblasts and, recently, mmps expression has been confirmed also in vivo  <cit> . these previous observations are in line with the results of our study in which we also found that both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were consistently expressed by epidermal and dermal cells and with different intensity.

mmp- <dig> is secreted as pro-mmp- <dig>  and is activated into the functional form .

in equine sarcoids our data show for the first time, the overexpression of a  <dig> kda super-active form of mmp- <dig>  an auto-catalytic product of the 82kda proform, which possesses highly efficient proteolytic activity for different ecm proteins   <cit> . in our sarcoid samples, mmp- <dig> was expressed by sfs and keratinocytes, strongly suggesting its role in the formation of long rete pegs  <cit> ; this in turn promotes keratinocyte detachment from the basement zone through controlled digestion of type iv collagen.

thus, sarcoid development could be the result of fibroblast stimulated proliferation of overlying epithelial cells , which in turn stimulate the fibroblasts in the underlying dermis to proliferate and to produce more collagen.

in our study, mmp- <dig> showed a variable and finely granular staining pattern in 30–50 % of sfs, confirming that fibrillar collagens, rather that collagen iv, are its specific substrate.

normally, mmp- <dig> is secreted as pro-mmp- <dig>  and is activated into the functional form . biochemical analysis showed that mmp- <dig> was overexpressed and hyper-activated in 50 % of sarcoid samples, when compared to normal skin. moreover, in sarcoids mmp- <dig> expression was associated with a weak to moderate expression of mmp- <dig>  which is considered its main activator; this, with a strong expression of timp- <dig>  which is considered its main inhibitor  <cit> . although mmp- <dig> expression seems increased, the higher level of timp- <dig>  could lead to a decrease in mmp <dig> collagenolytic activity, which in turn causes insufficient degradation of collagen produced in excess by sfs. in fact, in our sarcoid samples a high content of collagen was observed, suggesting that ecm deposition continues with insufficient degradation.

therefore, we postulate that excessive and progressive deposition of connective tissue  in sarcoids, as well as in keloids  <cit> , might not only be the result of elevated synthesis by sfs, but also caused by a deficiency in matrix degradation due to an alterated expression of mmps and timps. this imbalance between production and degradation of collagen could play an important role in the pathogenesis of the equine sarcoid. therefore, it may be suggested that, in genetically predisposed equines with latent bvp infection, an altered wound healing process creates a microenvironment that activates the latent infection, leading to neoplastic transformation and sarcoid formation.

CONCLUSIONS
currently, there is no efficient curative therapy for equine sarcoids. the commonly employed treatments include cryotherapy, surgical excision and local immune modulation  <cit> . the present findings include the identification of the main cellular effectors of sarcoid growth, that is, the key cytokines regulating the scar formation process, and the regulators of ecm turnover; these findings therefore open the avenue for a number of potential therapeutic approaches that are likely to be developed in the near future.
