BACKGROUND
in the post genomic era one of the most challenging tasks is to reveal modular structures in biological networks, in order to comprehend the function and the dynamics of a living cell  <cit> . the vast amount of genes and proteins that participate in biological networks imposes the need for determination of functional modules within the network in order to reduce the complexity, while these modules will be the first step in deciphering the composite genetic or cellular interactions of the overall network.

the functional module is defined  <cit>  as a group of genes or their products, whose function is separable from those of other modules. the members of the group share genetic or cellular interactions e.g. co-expression, members of the same protein complex, or of the same metabolic or signalling pathway, or of the same cellular aggregate. a very important property of the module is that its members share more interactions among themselves than with the members of other modules, which is obvious in the network topology  <cit> .

the determination of small-scale functional modules, in the form of protein complexes  <cit>  included in them, from large-scale interaction networks is therefore crucial in understanding the relation between the function and organization of a network. towards this goal, several algorithms, ranging from hierarchical clustering  <cit>  to methods considering local topology-based concepts  <cit>  and graph alignment for determining probabilistic motifs  <cit> , have recently been applied for detecting modules in protein interaction networks. in these approaches the protein network is considered as an unweighted graph, where nodes correspond to proteins and edges to interactions among them. algorithms based solely on topological aspects manage to capture several features of complex networks. nevertheless they might prove to be insufficient when applied at protein interaction networks that include special characteristics like inter-module crosstalk.

in this direction recent studies perform clustering after transforming the graph to its weighted correspondent. various methods have been applied for weighting a graph. pereira et al.  <cit>  weighted an interaction based on the number of experiments that support it. rives and galitski  <cit>  and arnau et al.  <cit>  weighted the distance between two proteins with the minimum shortest path between them. even though these approaches assign some kind of confidence score in a certain interaction, still they fail to allocate a possible functional association in a pair of proteins.

the development of high throughput techniques, such as yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> , protein complex identification by mass spectrometry  <cit>  and microarray gene expression profiles  <cit> , have generated a vast amount of data concerning gene/protein function but the challenging task is to integrate different data sources, in order to find more reliable functional modules in the network topology. clustering in gene expression, showed that similarity in biological role often corresponds to expression similarity  <cit>  but there are cases where functionally related genes show dissimilar expression profiles or are inversely co-regulated  <cit> .

on the other side protein-protein interaction data reflects the collaboration of proteins to achieve a common goal. several initial studies  <cit>  attempted to investigate possible relation among mrna and protein expression level. these works resulted in the fact that expression levels and protein abundance are correlated to some degree. these first concepts were furthered investigated by works like jansen et al.  <cit>  and tornow and mewes  <cit>  that revealed a relation between ppi and gene expression, by associating both data sources. specifically it was shown that the subunits of a permanent complex are co-expressed whereas protein interactions that descend from transient complexes or from yeast two-hybrid experiments have weak relationship with gene expression. in addition, recent studies concentrated on inferring gene function based on both data sources  <cit> .

in our study we introduce a new method for integrating gene expression data and protein-protein interactions  in order to determine functional modules. specifically, given a graph describing a set of proteins and the experimentally determined interactions among them, we assign a non-negative weight to each one of these interactions. this weight descends from clustering the gene expression profiles of the corresponding proteins, an approach that to the best of our knowledge has not been used before in the literature. our goal is to discover biologically relevant ppi subnetworks, out of a larger network, whose proteins interact significantly. therefore, after the creation of the weighted graph we suggest a new algorithm for the determination of functional modules within the original ppi graph starting from a kernel protein group that originates from a 'seed' protein.

we prove based on data of saccharomyces cerevisiae that the integrated approach we present manages to adequately and solely identify coherent modules and at the same time outperforms other methods in the literature.

RESULTS
in our approach, we have reinforced the simple graph structure by integrating gene expression profiles and protein interactions of saccharomyces cerevisiae, in order to detect valid functional modules, in terms of protein complexes they contain. we created a weighted ppi graph, in which the weight of the interactions originates from clustering the gene expression profiles of the corresponding proteins. specifically the weight of a ppi derives from a metric that takes into account the distance of the corresponding gene expression profiles from the centroids of their clusters, as well as the distance between the two cluster centroids themselves. next we applied at the enriched ppi graph a new algorithm called dmsp , whose role was to construct functional modules starting from a 'seed' protein that belongs to our dataset. all the steps of this procedure are described in detail at the methods section.

the derived modules are evaluated in terms of functional enrichment in go terms, structural coherency and coverage in protein complexes. additionally we compare the modules of our integrated method with the modules descending from ppi data only , after the application of the algorithm described in the study of wu and hu  <cit>   to our ppi dataset.

case study evaluation
to our knowledge there are no studies similar to ours, except one presented in  <cit> , whose algorithm builds likewise modules from seed proteins based however only on ppi data. of course in literature there many available algorithms for partitioning the ppi graph  <cit> , nevertheless they have different theoretical concept and implement an overall clustering of the graph, whereas dmsp as well as other similar methods like the w&h algorithm focus on certain parts of the ppi network. specifically these algorithms concentrate on specific fractions of the graph structure in the sense that the determination of the functional modules is directed by the initial protein seed given as input to the algorithm. thus, in order to avoid the probable false superiority of our algorithm against an overall clustering approach, we will compare the performance of our integrated method against a method restricted to protein-protein interaction data only  <cit> .

in this work we constructed several functional modules starting from a randomly selected 'seed' protein. this protein is part of a known protein complex that we want to examine. our approach manages to prevail over the method of wu and hu  <cit>  in all the cases examined in this work. an example is the module of the srb-srb10p complexes  that was built with srb <dig> as seed protein. srb10p is a cyclin dependent kinase complex  that phosphorylates rna polymerase ii and participates in transcription  <cit> . srb is a mediator complex that transmits regulatory signals from dna-binding transcription factors to rna polymerase ii  <cit> . our method succeeded to find 4/ <dig> proteins of srb10p complex and 18/ <dig> proteins of srb complex, in a module of  <dig> members . in comparison to the similar study  <cit> , which found 14/ <dig> proteins of srb in a module of  <dig> members along with other complexes, our results are better and the method captured the srb10p complex that is associated to srb in transcriptional level.

the sub-columns of 'functional modules' contain statistical data for various modules of different size, while in the two last sub-columns we display the mips description of the basic complexes of each module and their corresponding p-values.  dmsp manages to find the entire complex.

a second example is the module of dna polymerase alpha  primase-not-ccr <dig> complexes, identified with cdc <dig> as seed protein . the dna polymerase alpha  – primase complex contains  <dig> proteins, all involved in dna replication  <cit> . its structural and biochemical properties are conserved across a wide range of species. not complex contains  <dig> proteins and ccr <dig> complex contains  <dig> proteins. both complexes are gene expression regulators and participate in transcription and in dna damage response. our method succeeded to find 5/ <dig> proteins of not complex, 4/ <dig> proteins of dna polymerase alpha  – primase complex and 7/ <dig> proteins of ccr <dig> complex in a module of  <dig> members. again in comparison to the study of wu and hu  <cit>  our method gave better results since the module they determined had  <dig> members. another interesting module is the arp2p/arp3p complex  that was constructed with arc <dig> as 'seed' protein. this complex involves  <dig> proteins, which take part in actin-filament organization and influence the maintenance of actin-based structures  <cit> . our method succeeded to find 5/ <dig> proteins of this complex in a module of  <dig> members . again in comparison to the associated study  <cit> , our method gave better results, since their module consisted of  <dig> members.

finally, we present the module of ada-saga-tfiid complexes  that was built with taf <dig> as seed protein. ada complex is part of a larger complex named ada complexes, which contains proteins that play an essential role in organization of chromosome structure  <cit>  and in transcription. saga complex is a multifunctional co-activator that regulates transcription by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . tfiid contains proteins mostly involved in initiation of rna polymerase ii transcription and in transcriptional control  <cit> . saga and tfiid are closely related since both participate in the expression of rna polymerase ii transcribed genes  <cit> . our method succeeded to find over 95% of the ada and saga complexes, and 13/ <dig> of tfiid complex in a module of  <dig> members . in comparison to the study of wu and hu  <cit> , our method again presents better results since they identified in a module of  <dig> members, parts of the saga and tfiid complexes.

the defect of the algorithm used in the cross-checked study, is that it tends to build large modules in order to capture certain complexes, whereas dmsp builds small-sized modules where almost all members are part of a complex. in this way the condition proposed by spirin and mirny  <cit> , that the size of a module should range within 5– <dig> members, is satisfied.

nevertheless, if we want to examine thoroughly our approach, we have to extend the conducted experiments beyond isolated and individual examples. in a task like this the eloquent question is how we choose the 'seed' proteins. the answer lies in the concept of protein complexes that have the leading role in the overall evaluation of our method. specifically we chose to examine complexes with more than  <dig> members and 80% coverage in terms of proteins included in our data set. the first limitation is based on the fact that it is very probable for small protein complexes to be contained in large functional modules by chance. the second limitation deals with the way we gathered data for this study . so there are cases where the method fails to give good results for certain complexes. in other words while the information we have included in the study is adequate, for certain cases can be insufficient. most of the studies, that exploit ppi data, avoid weeding out the false positive and false negative interactions, thus this 'burden' can result in misleading functional modules. however, the limitations of our dataset offer the advantage of predicting highly confident functional modules leaving though some space for interactions that are not yet established but have high probability to be correct. one example displaying this characteristic is the module of h+-transporting atpase vacuolar that was built from vma <dig> as seed protein. the role of v-atpase complex in eukaryotic cells  is to couple the energy of atp hydrolysis into proton transport across intracellular and plasma membranes  <cit> . our ppi network contains 9/ <dig> of the members of this complex and the rest  <dig> proteins are not included. this case shows that our information is insufficient in this case. our method succeeded to capture 8/ <dig> proteins of this complex in a module of  <dig> members. in order to find 9/ <dig> members the module must have  <dig> members. this abrupt enlargement of the subnetwork results from the  <dig> proteins that we lack, but at the same time underlines the efficiency of the proposed integrated method.

we return now to the issue of deciding a set of proteins that will be used as 'seeds' for the construction of functional modules throughout the whole data set, in order to evaluate better our method. towards this goal we have followed a methodology where we sorted the members of a certain complex, that fulfils the two limitation discussed above . specifically we sorted its members starting with the one that had the largest number of neighbours  down to the member with the smallest number of neighbours. subsequently we created a set with the top 20% of the sorted members. these protein sets were used as 'seed' proteins in our method. our results show that a large amount of members in the initially selected protein set can be used as 'seed' resulting always in the same module. an example is the module of 20s proteasome complex  which is identified using one of the scl <dig>  pre <dig>  pre <dig>  pre <dig>  pre <dig>  pre <dig> proteins as seed. this complex  is involved in protein degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway  <cit> . our method found 15/ <dig> proteins of this complex in a module of  <dig> proteins . this remark elucidates the flexibility of our algorithm that manages to capture the 'correct' modules independently of the 'seed' protein. in other words the vital need is not the determination of only one protein but of a candidate population of proteins that all will end up in the same result. once the candidate population is determined the final choice of the 'seed' protein can be random.

validation of functional modules
in order to test the validity of the functional modules determined by our integrated approach we will employ three criteria. the first one includes the gene ontology annotation scheme to gain insights in the common underlying biological processes of the modules. the second one utilizes the metric of connectivity density to show how well connected the determined modules are, while the last one uses a metric we call complex coverage for checking their biological relevance. at this point it is worth mentioning that in order to show that our integrated approach is superior to a method restricted to ppi data only, we applied the w&h to our ppi dataset and examined the resulted modules with all  <dig> validation criteria mentioned above. however the forthcoming comparisons have different interpretation from the case study evaluation where we cross-checked our modules with the modules of the associated study as mentioned in the literature.

additionally and in order to have a more coherent evaluation we compared the results of our approach in terms of functional enrichment analysis with a method using gene expression data only. specifically following the methodology described in  <cit>  we have created a co-expression network, where every gene expression profile corresponds to a node. under this scheme a co-expression network is based on the absolute value of correlation coefficient among genes and is represented by an adjacency matrix. after creating the network we applied an average linked hierarchical clustering algorithm using diss =  <dig> - aij = 1-|cor | <dig>  as a dissimilarity measure where xi represents the expression profile of the i-th gene.

returning to the issue concerning the validation check of the dmsp extracted functional modules, we firstly substantiated the biological significance of our modules by estimating the go biological process term co-occurrence with the use of the sgd go term finder  <cit> . this tool calculates a p-value that represents the probability of observing the co-occurrence of certain proteins with a specific go annotation in a module by chance based on binomial distribution. the statistical significance of a module in a go term is increased as the p-value gets lower. we scanned all modules resulted by dmsp as well as the modules descended from the w&h algorithm in order to examine their functional enrichment in biological process go terms. in figure  <dig> it is obvious that the majority of dmsp modules  has p-value bins larger than  <dig>  whereas the p-value bins of 80% of the w&h modules and 83% of the modules determined by clustering the co-expression network range between  <dig> and  <dig>  this comparison establishes the superiority of our integrated method versus approaches using only one of the two kinds of genomic data, since the objective of a module-detecting study is to identify modules whose members participate up to a great degree in the same biological processes and thus fulfill the biological interpretation of the term 'functional module'. also further in our validation process we examined the modules through the protein complexes they assess. protein complexes are too strong indicatives that the members they contain take part in the same biological process, since the definition of protein complex requires its members to accomplish a distinct task at the same time and place  <cit> . specifically one module detected by our integrated approach is characterized by apc , an ubiquitin-protein ligase, which is responsible for the degradation of mitotic cyclins. specifically it destroys anaphase inhibitory proteins and triggers the separation of sister chromatids  <cit> . in this way it creates the low cdk state essential for cytokinesis and for reforming the pre-rcs complexes needed for another round of genome replication. our algorithm managed to include all its  <dig> proteins in a module of  <dig> members. the go term finder showed that this module is statistically enriched in two go terms, cyclin catabolic process  and mitotic spindle elongation , with the p-value < e- <dig> in both cases.

the verification of how well connected are the members of a module will be resolved by employing the connectivity density. connectivity density is the ratio of the total in-module degrees of the vertices to the total number of their connections. this metric has been used in many other similar studies  <cit> . the connectivity density has a value between  <dig> and  <dig>  but its value should fluctuate between  <dig>  and  <dig> if we want to have well established results. the higher the value of connectivity density the more probable the determination of a functional module is correct.

based on the concept of connectivity density we tested the capabilities of our algorithm by tuning the parameters from the zenith  up to their nadir  and we checked how connectivity density varies accordingly. as we see in figure 3a the selection of looser criteria  leads to an increased number of modules but the densities range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . on the other hand when we apply gradually stricter parameters  connectivity density also increases gradually. it is obvious though that we assess a smaller number of modules but the density of the majority of those ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . we have already mentioned that it is essential for the modules to have density above  <dig> , so the strictest parameters were the chosen ones in our study.

another worth mentioning aspect of our integrated method is the adaptability of our algorithm concerning the size of the module versus the size of the kernel protein set. in figure 3b we display various cases dealing with the size of the kernel and of the module. it is obvious that the size of the module rises not analogically with the size of the kernel but rather in an 'adaptive' manner. this property of the dmsp algorithm pinpoints its ability to expand the kernel independently of its size and this procedure continues until the algorithm can no more add proteins to the expanding kernel. this property is demonstrated through replication factor c complex . this complex  functions as a dna-dependent atpase and takes part in dna replication  <cit>  and dna repair  <cit> . our method succeeded to find all  <dig> proteins in a module of  <dig> proteins , with the size of initial kernel equal to  <dig> members. in comparison to the study of wu and hu  <cit>  our results are better, since their study identified all  <dig> members in a module of  <dig> members. our method managed to control the growing procedure to such a number of proteins in the final module which is very close to the size of the kernel.

the extracted functional modules were evaluated from the biological point of view by a metric that takes into consideration the number of protein complexes that have been successfully encapsulated in a module. before describing it, we are inserting a new term named basic complex. basic complex is a complex within a module where the p-value is less than a certain limit which in this work is set to be 10- <dig>  p-value is a measure concerning the degree up to which a module manages to capture a particular complex. this metric is mathematically described by:

 r=1−12∑t=1l|nct|+|mi|−∑t=1l|mi|)

where mi is the members of the i-th functional module, nct is the size of a real basic complex, and nft the size of the corresponding determined complex. l determines the number of basic complexes within the module. value of r ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  with  <dig> being the ideal case where our method manages to find all the proteins of the all basic complexes and  <dig> as the extreme case where no member of any basic complex has been found . in our study we focused on a certain number of modules that we denominate confident and reliable. thus, after running the algorithm with strict criteria for all selected seed proteins we ended up with  <dig> modules. however,  <dig> of those had connectivity density over  <dig>  and fulfilled the two constraints discussed above. subsequently, this set of  <dig> modules is supported by our integrated method as reliable and accurate.

next step was to create artificial modules so as to make feasible the comparison, in terms of both connectivity density as well as complex coverage, with the derived modules. specifically we have implemented a randomization procedure, where we replaced 30% of the proteins of the modules with others that connect to the members of the module but do not belong to it. this randomized replacement was realized iteratively  <dig> times for each one of the  <dig> modules and the average connectivity density was measured . each one of the artificial modules is the average of these  <dig> random replacements. also the protein complex coverage r was estimated before and after the randomization  for all  <dig> modules following the concept realized in connectivity density. it is evident in figure 4a that all artificial modules have smaller connectivity density than the derived ones, indicating that our algorithm unveils functional modules with self-reliance. as it is obvious  the determined modules have always better coverage in protein complexes than the artificial ones. in other words the functional modules identified by our integrated method are dominated by known protein complexes, many of which are sometimes identified in their entirety. this remark elucidates the biggest accomplishment of our study i.e. to unravel from the 'spider-like' protein web subnetworks that have a unique and distinct biological role.

lastly in our analysis we compare the modules of our integrated method with the modules of the ppi method by checking their connectivity density as well as the complex coverage . in figure 5a it is apparent that the connectivity density in 75% of the w&h modules ranges between  <dig> and  <dig> , whereas 83% of the dmsp modules have connectivity density varying between  <dig>  and  <dig>  this visible difference is explained by the way the two algorithms constitute neighbourhoods around the seed protein. on one hand dmsp algorithm embraces only proteins that are strongly supported both by ppi as well as by gene expression data. in this way the resulting modules are by far more densely connected because the respective proteins were allowed to enter the modules after complying with the constraints raised by both types of data. on the other hand w&h algorithm based only on the topological properties of the ppi network constructs modules whose size is in many cases bigger, since it includes proteins that are not so well connected to the other members, thus the connectivity density decreases enormously. the same scene is repeated when it comes to the metric r. in figure 5b it is evident that r in 75% of the w&h modules ranges between 0– <dig> , whereas 90% of the dmsp modules have r varying between  <dig> – <dig>  again this difference emphasizes the superiority of our integrated method and the reason is easily understood. the metric r, as defined, is affected not only by the number of protein complex members encapsulated in the module but also by the size of the respective module. based on this the w&h algorithm loses against dmsp because we observed that its modules are in most cases bigger in size, with the majority of the members sharing same functional annotation but with poor protein complex coverage. the two bar plots of figure  <dig> as well as the diagram of figure  <dig> constitute the proofs that our integrated approach prevails over the ppi method both from biological as well as by topological point of view.

CONCLUSIONS
the post genomic era poses two closely connected challenges. the first challenge is the consolidation of all kinds of high-throughput data, which in fact all describe the same complex dynamics of the living cell but through different perspectives. the second challenge is to unlock the hidden biologically meaningful structures  that lie in these integrated constructions. our method is based on the integration of protein interaction and gene expression profile data, whose association has already been validated by other studies. we overlaid the information descending from gene expression clustering as weights onto a ppi yeast graph, with quite highly confident interactions. this accomplishment fulfils the need for consolidation.

subsequently, we propose a new algorithm , which constitutes subnetworks that originate from a kernel protein set built up from a 'seed' protein. in order for us to characterize these subnetworks as functional modules we checked their biological relevance. this was achieved through some criteria such as the functional enrichment of the resulting modules in go terms, their connectivity density, their coverage in known complexes and the degree of resemblance between the modules of our integrated approach and the modules of an associated work. our results show that the majority of our modules have both connectivity density as well as r, over  <dig> . additionally the modules of our integrated method outperform the corresponding modules of the ppi method in all validation criteria. thus, we succeeded to fulfil the second expectation mentioned above.

it is obvious that the concept of our method can be extended to any set of cellular and genetic data. in future work we plan to use this integrated approach and the concept of dmsp as a basic component for an algorithm that will perform graph clustering in the overall ppi network, again having as goal the identification of functional modules as well as the functional dependencies between modules.
