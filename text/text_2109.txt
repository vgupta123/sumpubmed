BACKGROUND
transcription factors  bind to dna and regulate mrna synthesis in response to different stimuli via multiple protein domains endowing separate functions such as the binding to small ligands, the recognition of specific dna sequences and the ability to activate or repress transcription. for the latter function it is frequently observed that more than one activation or repression domain can be present in a single tf  <cit> . in addition, it is well known that transcription factors can be regulated by post-translational modifications, chiefly phosphorylation <cit> . however, the function of the diverse activation domains included in a single transcription factor or the role of post-translational modification has been assessed largely in cultured cells. this approach has obvious limitations since many tfs play important roles in diverse cell types and at different stages of development. thus, whether the diverse functions of a tf could be assigned to separate protein domains or to post-translational modifications is a question that has been rarely addressed and it requires to carry out structure-function relationships studies in whole organisms expressing modified transcription factors lacking only one of its domains and/or mutated in its phosphorylation sites in order to block such post-translational modification. the homeodomain containing transcription factor nkx2- <dig>  <cit>  is well suited for this type of studies since it plays important roles in organogenesis and differentiation of several organs such as lung, brain, thyroid and pituitary <cit> . in addition, it has been suggested that nkx2- <dig> plays diverse roles at different stages in thyroid organogenesis, implying that it may change function, and, hence, target genes, during this process <cit> . in keeping with this notion, thyroid specific ablation of the gene encoding nkx2- <dig>  carried out late in organogenesis, results in altered follicular organization of the thyroid gland <cit> , while knock-out of the same gene results in complete absence of the gland <cit> .

nkx2- <dig> contains two well defined transcription activation domain that appear to be redundant for function in co-transfection assays <cit> . furthermore, nkx2- <dig> is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation but both in dna binding or in co-transfection assays no role could be assigned to this modification <cit> . however, that phosphorylation might be important for nkx2- <dig> transcriptional activity has been suggested in studies indicating that erk-mediated phosphorylation of this transcription factor might play a role in ras-induced loss of its transcriptional activity in an in vitro model of thyroid tumoral transformation <cit> . furthermore, studies in transgenic mice have demonstrated that mice homozygous for a nkx2- <dig> allele encoding a phosphorylation-resistent protein are defective for lung cell differentiation, but no data are available on the role of nkx2- <dig> phosphorylation in other organs <cit> . in this study we tested whether the two activation domains of nkx2- <dig> have separate functions in vivo and demonstrate that these domains plays differential roles in thyroid and pitutary. furthermore, we demonstrate that a nkx2- <dig> mutant, encoding a phosphorylation defective protein, brings about critical defects in organization of thyroid follicles, without affecting earlier stages of development that are known to be dependent on the presence of the nkx2- <dig> protein.

taken together these data show that at least some of the multiple functions of nkx2- <dig> are endowed into separate domains of the protein and that other functions depend on specific protein modifications. we believe that these data supporting evidence for mechanisms capable of generating novel functions in evolution.

RESULTS
generation of knock-in mice expressing nkx2- <dig> mutants
we previously demonstrated, by co-transfection assays carried out in non-thyroid cells in culture, that three nkx2- <dig> mutants  encoding proteins in which either transactivation domain  <dig> or  <dig> was deleted  or phosphorylable serine residues have been mutagenized , all retained their transcriptional activities in vitro <cit> . in order to assess the function of these mutants in the mouse, we generate three novel mouse strains, each homozygous for alleles encoding either Δnh <dig>  Δcooh, or pm nkx2- <dig> protein. a knock-in approach was designed to rearrange the nkx2- <dig> locus  in such a way to exclude the synthesis of the wild type gene product and to direct the expression of the mutant allele under the regulatory regions of the endogenous gene. appropriate homologous recombination was achieved with all constructs and the heterozygous mice produced were backcrossed for seven generation with c57bl/6j wt mice to obtain all mutant mice in the same genetic background. heterozygous mice were then intercrossed to generate homozygous mice .

the expression of Δnh <dig> or Δcooh mutant proteins in thyroid tissue was evaluated in a mobility shift assay carried out using an oligonucleotide containing a high affinity nkx2- <dig> binding site . protein extracts from either +/Δnh <dig> or +/Δcooh heterozygous thyroids show two dna binding activities consistent with the presence of both wild type  and mutant proteins . the levels of expression of the nkx2- <dig> mutants are comparable to those of wild type.

to verify that the rearranged pm allele was not producing any phosphorylated protein, western blot analysis was carried out on lung tissues dissected from e <dig> pm/pm embryos. lambda phosphatase treatment of protein extract from wt lung results in an increase in the relative mobility of nkx2- <dig> on sds-page . the pm protein has a mobility identical of the phosphatase treated nkx2- <dig>  and shows no further increase in mobility after phosphatase treatment . these data strongly suggest that pm nkx2- <dig> is not phosphorylated in vivo, as already demonstrated in cell lines  <cit> .

both activation domains and phosphorylation in the nkx2- <dig> protein are essential for life
mice heterozygous for mutant alleles encoding either Δnh <dig>  Δcooh or pm are born and develop normally, without apparent abnormalities in growth or reproduction. on the contrary, no live pups were obtained from mice homozygous for any of the three mutant alleles. these mice die at birth, presumably of respiratory failure. necropsy of both Δnh <dig> and Δcooh homozygous reveals severe lung abnormalities comparable with those described in nkx2- <dig> null mice ; lungs do develop in pm/pm mice but they show severe functional anomalies, as already reported  <cit> . these results indicate that both transactivation domains of nkx2- <dig> as well as its phosphorylation are required for normal development and differentiation of lungs.

previous studies also demonstrated that at least one copy of a functional nkx2- <dig> allele is required for the organogenesis of both pituitary and thyroid <cit> . in order to address whether different domains of nkx2- <dig> or its phosphorylation have specific roles in the development of these two structures, we decided to analyze in better detail the phenotype of both developing pituitary and thyroid in mutant embryos.

pituitary organogenesis in wild type and mutant embryos
in rodent embryos nkx2- <dig> is expressed in the developing neurohypophysis but it is not present in the ratke's pouch, the precursor of the adenohypophysis <cit> . however, in the absence of nkx2- <dig> both structures are absent, demonstrating that the presence of this transcription factor is required, either directly or via the generation of inductive signals, in the organogenesis of the entire pituitary <cit> . consistent with this model, at e <dig> , in wt embryos , the neuroepithelial cells of the infundibulum are in close association to the anterior wall of the ratke's pouch. at e <dig>  the pituitary appears as a compact structure localized on the cartilaginous primordium of the basisphenoid bone . in both Δcooh  and pm homozygous  the pituitary is present and appears to be comparable in size with that of the wt embryo. on the contrary, in Δnh <dig> homozygous embryos , pituitary morphogenesis is severely impaired and it is indistinguishable from what observed in nkx2- <dig> null embryos with only a small rudimentary rathke's pouch and no evidence of any infundibular recess . in both mutants, at e <dig> , the pituitary is absent .

these data show that for complete pituitary development only activation domain  <dig> of nkx2- <dig> is essential, while both activation domain  <dig> and phosphorylation are dispensable. no information was collected on the functional differentiation of the pituitary.

thyroid development in wild type and mutant embryos
at e <dig>  in wt embryo the thyroid primordium has lost its connection with the floor of the pharynx, has invaded the underlying mesenchyme and is closely attached to the arcus aortae  <cit> . at this stage, in nkx2- <dig> null embryos the thyroid bud is undetectable. the same phenotype is seen in both Δnh <dig> and Δcooh homozygous embryos . in contrast, pm/pm embryos show the thyroid bud present, albeit smaller, and correctly located close to the arcus aortae.

at e <dig>  thyroid gland has reached its final localization, dorsal to the cricoid cartilage and ventral the trachea . at this stage, the thyroid is absent in both null, Δnh <dig> and Δcooh homozygous embryos , while in pm homozygous embryos the thyroid is correctly localized but it is clearly smaller than the gland of age-matched wt embryos. thus, at variance from pituitary, both nkx2- <dig> transactivation domains are necessary for thyroid development. the pm mutant does not seem to affect early morphogenesis of the gland but it does influence the size of the gland. thus we decided to investigate in better detail the thyroid differentiation in these mutants.

thyroid differentiation in pm/pm embryos
at e <dig> , the functional differentiation of thyroid has initiated; follicular cells, in addition to nkx2- <dig> and pax <dig>  express tg and faintly nis. immunostaining experiments show that in pm embryos nkx2- <dig> protein is correctly localized in the nuclei of follicular cells and the intensity of staining is similar between wt and pm/pm embryos . pax <dig>  tg and nis are detected in pm/pm thyroid cells, although a decreased number of cells express these proteins . notably, the expression of nis appears more robust in pm thyroid that in normal gland .

in embryos two days older  thyroid cells of pm embryos still express nkx2- <dig>  pax <dig>  tg and nis  and maintain the ability to synthesize thyroid hormones . however, in pm embryos the thyroid mass is visibly reduced and folliculogenesis appears to be impaired since only few and empty follicles are present .

nkx2- <dig> phosphorylation is required for folliculogenesis
to better characterize defects in the follicular organization of the gland, thyroids from wt and pm/pm embryos, at e <dig>   and e <dig>  , were examined by confocal laser microscopy, after immunofluorescence staining, to determine the presence and distribution of the cell-cell adhesion molecules e-cadherin and ksp-cadherin and of the tight junction component zo- <dig>  thyrocytes were identified by the nuclear staining of nkx2- <dig> . e-cadherin was present on the thyrocytes plasma membrane of all embryos, at cell-cell contact sites . in the pm/pm embryos more intracellular staining was present  with respect to wt embryos . ksp-cadherin was expressed in wt embryos and was distributed as the e-cadherin . in mutant mice, a less intense and more diffuse staining was observed and a membrane localization could be barely appreciated . zo- <dig> staining was mostly diffuse over the thyrocytes in all embryos . in wt embryos there were few areas where zo- <dig> staining appeared as intense dots arranged to sorround small roundish areas  which were suggestive of newly formed lumina.

at e <dig>  tg was well expressed in both wt  and mutant  thyroids. however, while in wt thyroids it was most often concentrated in lumina which were clearly defined by the dotty zo- <dig> staining , in mutant mice no lumina were defined by the presence of zo- <dig>  and tg, although present in significant amount, was not accumulated in the few irregular empty spaces that were observed . e-cadherin was similarly located on the plasma membrane of wt  and pm/pm  thyroids, but only in the former lumina were observed and e-cadherin was confined to the basolateral cell domain. ksp-cadherin was expressed at much higher levels in wt thyroids  where it appeared to be confined to the lateral cell domain of most cells.

overall these data indicate that the organization of follicular structures with lumina is missing in pm/pm mice as indicated by the lack of areas delimited by zo- <dig> staining in which thyroglobulin accumulates, like in control thyroids. lack of follicles correlates with a dramatic reduction in the thyroid/kidney specific ksp-cadherin. only in wt thyroids, where follicles form, the e- and ksp- cadherins segregate to the lateral thyroid epithelial cell domain.

identification of genes influenced by phosphorylation
the morphology of thyroid gland in pm/pm mice indicates that the first steps of organogenesis  as well as the onset of functional differentiation of thyroid follicular cells is unaffected in these mutant mice, whereas events leading to the follicular organization of the gland are impaired. these data suggest a critical role for phosphorylated nkx2- <dig> in this latter process. to identify genes whose expression is responsive to phosphorylation of nkx2- <dig>  rnas from e <dig> pm/pm thyroids and their wild type littermates were compared using the affymetrix mouse expression set u74av <dig> 

for each genotype,  <dig> independent rna samples were used, each representing rna pooled from  <dig> embryonic thyroids. statistically significant differences in the level of gene expression between pm/pm and respective control mice were identified with p-values ≤  <dig>  and fold change ≥  <dig> . using these parameters, of the  <dig>  transcripts with detectable expression in thyroid, the expression levels of  <dig> genes were different, with a fold change > <dig>  hierarchical clustering of these differentially regulated genes is shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> mrnas were decreased  and  <dig> increased  in the thyroids from pm/pm fetuses. three genes, napsa, sal <dig> and scgb1a <dig> have been selected for validation by in situ hybridization. figure  <dig> shows that in pm/pm fetal thyroid the expression of these genes is strongly down-regulated, in agreement with affymetrix analysis.

gene
 <dig> genes are downregulated in pm/pm thyroid at e <dig> when compared to wild type. genes were identified using affymetrix mouse expression set u74av <dig>  statistical significance of p-values ≤  <dig>  and fold change ≥  <dig>  were used as cutoffs for determining expression changes. genes were categorized based on function determined by gene ontology  term associations.

gene
 <dig> genes were dupregulated in pm/pm thyroid at e <dig> when compared to wild type. genes were identified using affymetrix mouse expression set u74av <dig>  statistical significance of p-values ≤  <dig>  and fold change ≥  <dig>  were used as cutoffs for determining expression changes. genes were categorized based on function determined by gene ontology  term associations.

classification of the  <dig> genes whose expression changes in the pm/pm background did not show an enrichment with any specific gene onthology category. however, the smalll number of genes affected by nkx2- <dig> phosphorylation does indicate a specific and restricted pathway controlled by a specific post-translational modification.

discussion
we show in this paper that the pleiotropic functions of the transcription factor nkx2- <dig> are not a property of the protein as a whole but can be, at least for some of the functions, assigned to specific protein domains or to post-translational modifications. in particular, we focused our attention to the effects of nkx2- <dig> in the development of thyroid and pituitary gland using three mutants: a) Δnh <dig>  a mutant deleted of the transcriptional activation domain  <dig>  located at the amino-terminus; b) Δcooh, a mutant deleted of the transcriptional activation domain  <dig>  located at the carboxyl-terminus and c) pm, a mutant where serine residues shown to be target for phosphorylation have been mutated in alanines, thus abolishing phosphorylation of the protein. it should be stressed that all these mutants show similar dna binding and transcriptional activation potential in co-transfection experiments <cit> . in contrast, we show in this study that each mutant shows a distinct phenotype, revealing a level of complexity that could not be predicted by experiments carried out in cultured cells and stressing the relevance of testing the functions, mostly of proteins with pleiotropic functions, in the context of the whole organism. knock-out experiments have demonstrated that the absence of nkx2- <dig> results in impaired thyroid, lung, brain and pituitary development <cit> . in the case of lung, thyroid and pituitary, absence of nkx2- <dig> shows absence of the structures where nkx2- <dig> is expressed, indicating an essential role of this protein in very early steps of organogenesis. while these experiments showed very clearly the important role of nkx2- <dig> in the cell types where it is expressed, the very early disappearance of the cognate structures, in particular of lung, thyroid and pituitary, did not allow any further analysis on the function of the protein later in development. the data provided here demonstrate that one of the functional domain of nkx2- <dig>  indicated as activation domain  <dig>  is dispensable for pituitary organogenesis. in contrast, both activation domains are required for thyroid development. this observation is relevant in two main aspects. the first is that the search for co-factors interacting with nkx2- <dig> for pituitary development could be restricted only to one of the two activation domains. the second is concerned with the debate of whether mutations in either transcription factors or in regulatory region are involved in evolutions of organisms. one argument against a putative role of mutations in tfs in evolution is the pleiotropy shown by most, if not all, this type of regulatory molecules. however, we demonstrate here that the pleiotropic action of nkx2- <dig> is due to the combination of diverse functions endowed in different domains of the protein. hence, mutations in one of these domains would not result in changes in all of its activity, thus making easier to envisage their positive role in organismal evolution  <cit> 

along these same lines are the data reported here on the role of phosphorylation in nkx2- <dig> function in thyroid differentiation. we show that mice expressing the pm mutant do develop lungs, pituitary and thyroid gland, at variance from the nkx2- <dig> knock-out mouse. the consequences of the pm mutation in lung functions have already been described <cit> . we did not address in this study the effect of this mutation in pituitary differentiation, or in specification of diencephalic neurons where nkx2- <dig> plays important roles  <cit> . in the thyroid, pm mutants show a near-normal expression of the genes involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis. the most relevant phenotype consists in a radically altered follicular architecture, as demonstrated by the deranged localization of e- and ksp-cadherin <cit>  and of the tight junction marker z0- <dig> <cit> , even though nkx2- <dig> protein is expressed at normal levels and it is properly located in the nuclei. interestingly, these results are comparable with those obtained with conditional nkx2- <dig> ko in thyroid, where also the main defect is the impaired folliculogenesis <cit> , suggesting that the dephosphorylated nkx2- <dig> is a loss of function mutant. thus, it can also be concluded from these data that the essential functions that nkx2- <dig> plays early in development, as shown by the disappearance of thyroid cell precursors in the nkx2- <dig> null mouse, do not require phosphorylation of the protein. in contrast, at later stages, when follicular cells reorganize themselves into follicles, nkx2- <dig> is capable of supporting proper organization of thyroid follicular cells only if phosphorylated. thus, it appears that nkx2- <dig> phosphorylation triggers a switch in the function of this transcription factor at later stages in development. such a notion is plausible since the the cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and hence the adhesiveness, must be different between the early and migrating thyroid cell precursor and the later, not moving and differentiated, thyroid follicular cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we show in this study that some of the pleiotropic function of the transcription factor nkx2- <dig> can be mapped to distinct portions of the protein or to its phosphorylation. this study shows that many functions can be encoded in diverse portions of the same polypeptide chain and provide an example of how to increase the functional potential of a genome without increasing the gene number.
