BACKGROUND
the main challenge of quantitative gene expression studies is to extract sufficient usable messenger ribonucleic acid , to avoid degradation and permit analysis for calculation of exact numbers of transcript. the processes of sample collection, transport, processing and storage may result in significant degradation of mrna  <cit> . because of the lability of mrna in clinical samples, it is essential that the integrity of the mrna is assessed before proceeding with downstream applications such as reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  and micro-array analyses. both techniques are highly sensitive and rely on meticulous and consistent sample processing  <cit> . the correct interpretation of transcript abundance requires stabilisation of the transcriptome at the point of sample collection, through storage and transport, in order for gene expression to be detected in a reproducible manner  <cit> .

the paxgene™ blood rna system , includes a stabilizing additive in an evacuated blood collection tube called the paxgene™ blood rna tube, and also sample processing reagents in the paxgene™ blood rna kit. the additive in the paxgene™ tube reduces rna degradation of  <dig>  ml of blood in the evacuated tube, and furthermore, the rna in whole blood has been shown to be stable at room temperature for  <dig> days, following storage for up to  <dig> months at -20°c and -80°c, and also after repeated freeze-thaw cycles  <cit> .

recent studies have shown that rna can be detected and quantified in peripheral blood collected into paxgene™ collection tubes, and has allowed comparison of rna levels between patients with diabetic retinopathy  <cit> , thyroid cancer  <cit>  and healthy controls.

the paxgene™ tube reagents have been used to assess inflammatory responses in vivo using  <dig>  ml of whole blood and in vitro using  <dig> μl of heparinised blood  <cit> . an assay using branched dna has been described to quantitatively measure mrna expression from small blood volumes, but this method did not utilise the paxgene™ blood rna system  <cit> .

children with pneumococcal disease in developing countries such as malawi often present late, and are critically ill by the time they reach hospital. it is difficult to collect  <dig>  mls of blood from such children in the evacuated paxgene™ blood rna tube using the suggested protocol, and therefore we sought to optimise the protocol for use in small, sick children by employing smaller blood volumes in paediatric microtubes, and to subsequently use the rna for the quantification of cytokine and mediator responses to invasive pneumococcal disease.

intracellular adhesion molecules , vascular cell adhesion molecules , β <dig> integrins , p-selectin and e-selectin are involved in the adhesion of circulating leucocytes to endothelial cells. p-selectin and icam- <dig>  are up-regulated in experimental pneumococcal meningitis  <cit> . pneumolysin, a major virulence factor for streptococcus pneumoniae increases icam- <dig> mrna  <cit> . fucoidin, an l-selectin blocker profoundly reduces leucocyte rolling , pleocytosis and increased csf protein levels in experimental pneumococcal meningitis, thereby reducing leucocyte dependent damage in bacterial meningitis  <cit> . interleukin- <dig>  production is a marker of sepsis-related mortality and poor outcome in models of pneumococcal disease  <cit>  and increased il- <dig> production has been shown in the lungs of pneumococcal-infected mice  <cit> . on the basis of existing knowledge of the biological function of the icam and il- <dig> genes in the host response to pneumococcal infection, we conducted a pilot study to quantify icam and il- <dig> gene expression in malawian children presenting with invasive pneumococcal disease. before proceeding with rt qpcr analysis, we validated the scaled-down method by assessing mrna integrity using an in-house assay that measures three regions of the gapdh transcript.

RESULTS
whole blood extraction from healthy volunteers
whole venous blood was collected from healthy volunteers and either  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  ml added to the paxgene blood rna reagent in the same ratio as the manufacturers guidelines. the total rna yield from  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ml of whole blood was  <dig>  –  <dig>  μg,  <dig>  –  <dig>  μg and  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg respectively. with optical density ratios  of  <dig> – <dig> . figure  <dig> shows agilent  <dig> bioanalyser traces for the total rna extracted from the different volumes of whole blood. panel a shows the full scale  blood rna extraction, panels b and c show total rna from the low volume extractions, for comparison panel d shows the trace for stratagene universal rna. the 18s and 28s rna peaks can be seen at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> seconds respectively. both the  <dig>  ml and  <dig>  ml extractions were loaded on to eukaryote total rna nano chips whereas the  <dig>  ml extractions were loaded on to eukaryote total rna pico chips. the bioanalyser software generates rna integrity numbers  for each sample giving an estimate of the rna integrity. total rna extracted from  <dig>  –  <dig>  ml had a rin of between  <dig>  and  <dig> . rna was reverse transcribed and assayed for a panel of reference genes to ensure expression profiles were maintained across all volumes extracted.

whole blood extraction from patients with invasive pneumococcal disease and controls
whole venous blood samples were collected from  <dig> children with confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease. a total of  <dig> children  were male, and the age range was  <dig>  to  <dig> years, median age  <dig>  years. there were  <dig>  non-survivors. of the children with ipd,  <dig> had meningitis and  <dig> had pneumonia .

total rna yield from  <dig>  ml of whole blood varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg with 260/ <dig> ratios of  <dig>  –  <dig> . eight small volume blood samples were processed using the method described below and amplified for the  <dig> gapdh assays. figure 2a shows that in all cases a good signal is detected across the whole gapdh gene, thereby indicating that full length mrna has been isolated. figure 2b shows the raw ct values obtained for the  <dig> samples with a panel of  <dig> additional housekeeper genes. the samples show excellent consistency in the expression levels for all the housekeeper assays further indicating that all the rna samples have good mrna integrity. the rt qpcr assays were shown to be a more sensitive method of rna qc analysis for samples and could be used in place of the bioanalyser.

the rna yields were low but sufficient cdna was produced to perform rt qpcr experiments to quantify icam and il- <dig> gene expression. relative gene expression  was significantly higher in survivors compared to non-survivors and controls . relative gene expression was significantly lower than in non-survivors than survivors; icam: median ;  <dig>   versus  <dig>  , and il-6: median ;  <dig>   versus  <dig>  . relative gene expression was significantly lower in controls than cases icam:  <dig>   versus  <dig>  and il-6:  <dig>   versus  <dig>   .

discussion
in this study using  <dig>  ml of whole blood we have modified the paxgene™ blood rna system for use in small sick children. our results show that in all cases a near equivalent signal is detected across the tested regions of the gapdh gene, thereby indicating that full length mrna has been isolated. in turn, this result in combination with the similar levels of expression seen for  <dig> reference genes suggests that other transcripts are useable for rt qpcr analyses. we believe that this approach to assessing transcript integrity will be of general utility in transcriptional analysis. the rna was then successfully applied for downstream quantitative gene expression of the icam- <dig> and il- <dig> genes, using rt qpcr.

our data show that icam- <dig> and il- <dig> expression are increased in cases compared to healthy controls, and that expression is also increased in survivors compared to non-survivors with invasive pneumococcal disease. this is consistent with a study by rieckmann et al. where elevated soluble icam- <dig>  levels were seen in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis  <cit> . increased il- <dig> expression has been shown in a rat model of pneumocococal infection  <cit> , and il- <dig> gg homozygous patients  were less likely to develop extrapulmonary pneumococcal infection   <cit> . icam- <dig> plays an important role in tight binding of leucocytes to the endothelium, and il- <dig> is required for the clearance of bacteria. our data would suggest that under-expression of both these mediators may be detrimental to the host.

the paxgene™ blood rna system allows stabilisation of the transcriptome at the point of collection, at the bedside, and thus facilitates the ready access of gene expression studies to the clinical research scientist. the samples do not need to be processed immediately, and can be stored at room temperature for up to  <dig> hours before freezing or extraction, although different handling conditions have been shown to contribute minimally  to differences in gene expression levels  <cit> .

previous researchers have found that the paxgene™ blood rna system produced reliable gene expression profiles using the affymetrix genechip® system, and showed small but significant differences in gene expression between two sample handling methods. samples which were freshly extracted had higher dna contamination, and lower total rna yield than those which were frozen at -20°c before extraction, but the authors do not explain this finding  <cit> . in this study we have chosen a consistent method of sample processing  to reduce variability. another study showed that a longer incubation time of  <dig> hours in paxgene™ tubes before extraction produced a higher total rna yield than incubation times of  <dig> hours. this might be another useful strategy for application to small volume samples such as those drawn from children  <cit> .

the method described in this study produced sufficient mrna for successful downstream quantitative gene expression analysis, but did not consistently produce sufficient rna for application on a micro-array using affymetrix genechips®.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary the results presented here show a robust efficient system for the collection and processing of blood samples to allow accurate expression profiling. we have demonstrated that  <dig>  ml of whole blood can be routinely used as the basis for transcriptional profiling studies thereby making this approach available to neonatal and paediatric studies, but may have other clinical applications where availability of blood is limited, such as small animal veterinary science.
