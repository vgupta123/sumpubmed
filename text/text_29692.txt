BACKGROUND
the detection of an unusual, highly conserved sequence motif "his-phi-his-phi-his-phi-phi"  in a variety of organisms of all kingdoms led to the definition of a new family of proteins named hit   <cit> . this family has three main branches: the fragile histidine triad -related proteins found in animals and fungi, which act as di-adenosine polyphosphate hydrolases and function as tumor suppressors in humans and mice  <cit>  , the galt  homologues, which have a modified "his-phi-his-phi-gln" motif, which transfers nucleoside monophosphates to phosphorylated secondary substrates rather than hydrolyzing them  <cit> , and the histidine-triad nucleotide binding  homologues, which in eukaryotes are intracellular receptors and hydrolases of purine mononucleotides  <cit> . although hint homologues are found in all kingdoms and this family is the most ancient and widespread branch of the hit proteins, the cellular function, the substrates and the interaction partners of hint proteins are largely unknown. in prokaryotes, knowledge of hint proteins is generally restricted to sequence analyses. in the cell wall-less prokaryote mycoplasma hominis, the cytoplasmic hint protein interacts with a surface localized membrane complex by binding to the p <dig> moiety. interestingly, the genes encoding p <dig> and p <dig>  the domains of the membrane complex, form an operon with the hint gene  <cit> . the identification of a homologous hit locus in m. pulmonis and access to several sequenced prokaryotic genomes enabled us, in this study, to hypothetically identify interaction partners and thus propose a functional role for hint in bacteria with small genomes.

RESULTS
to find out more about the function of prokaryotic hint proteins we first analyzed the hit loci of bacteria with a restricted genome, with the view that they might represent a model for organisms possessing the minimal genetic make-up essential for life as a free-living organism. as polycistronically organized genes often encode proteins that are functionally related  we ran a search of known genome sequences for genes closely neighbouring or overlapping the hit gene. species from the mollicutes and the chlamydiaceae fulfill these requirements and were thus analyzed.

mollicutes are phenotypically distinguished from other bacteria by their minute size and total lack of a cell wall. they have evolved as a branch of gram-positive bacteria by a process of reductive evolution. the significant genome "condensation"  was made possible by adopting a parasitic behavior. the primary habitats of human and animal mycoplasmas are the mucous surfaces which they colonize during infection  <cit> . while the intracellular localization of mollicutes in insect tissues is well established, cell entry of human or animal mycoplasmas seems to be rare and possibly mediated by a site-directed, receptor-mediated event found in chlamydia  <cit> . however, chlamydiaceae have a number of features in common with mycoplasmas: their small genomes predict a limited metabolic capability, their major target tissue are mucous membranes and they also cause ocular and sexually transmitted diseases. in contrast, the chlamydia are obligate-intracellular bacteria that undergo a unique developmental cycle in which is an alteration in size between the small metabolically inactive infectious elementar body and the relatively large, metabolically active reticular body which is adapted for intracellular growth  <cit> . bearing in mind, that in m. hominis the hint-interacting protein is a secreted antigen and thus predicted to play a role in the pathogenicity of mycoplasmas we expand this analysis to include a family of obligate-intracellular organisms known to secrete antigens in the inclusion body in the infected cell.

organization of the hit-locus in mollicutes
hit loci with a genomic organization comparable to that of m. hominis  <cit> , with the hitab genes encoding two membrane proteins and hitl encoding the cytoplasmic hint, were detected in nearly half of the mollicute genomes analyzed . the highest similarity was found with the hit locus of m. pulmonis. the mypu_ <dig> encoded protein had  <dig>  % identity to the m. hominis hint protein, and the predicted mypu_ <dig> and mypu_ <dig> proteins were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % identical to the membrane proteins p <dig> and p <dig> of m. hominis, which were encoded by hitab. mypu_ <dig> had structural features similar to those of p <dig>  with an amino-terminal signal sequence with a predicted signal peptidase i  cleavage site and a predominantly alpha-helical structure  <cit> . mypu_ <dig> began with an amino-terminal signal sequence of transmembrane helix  and a signal peptidase ii recognition site with a lipoprotein attachment site at position  <dig>  thus, mypu_ <dig> of m. pulmonis appears to encode a p <dig> homologue, a cysteine-anchored lipoprotein. the order of genes within the hit loci of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc , mesoplasma florum  and m. mobile  was similar with two genes predicted to encode membrane proteins and a downstream hitl gene. the similarities between the predicted sequences of msc_ <dig>  mf_ <dig> and mmob_ <dig>  and p <dig> of m. hominis were quite low and the proteins would be significantly larger than p <dig>  while mmob_ <dig> contained a signal peptidase i recognition site, like p <dig>  msc_ <dig> and mf_ <dig> were pro-lipoproteins with an amino-terminal spase ii recognition sequence. only msc_ <dig> was predicted to have a predominantly alpha-helical structure, mf_ <dig> being predicted to have a secondary structure of alternate alpha helical and beta sheet regions and mmob_ <dig> to consist mainly of beta sheets . the proteins encoded by the gene next to hitl had little similarity with p <dig> of m. hominis when the whole sequence was compared. however, when the p <dig> protein region from aa  <dig> to aa  <dig>  was used, identities of  <dig> %  to 57%  were detected and scrutiny of the sequence from aa  <dig> to aa  <dig>  revealed  <dig> %  to  <dig> % identity . the corresponding proteins of mesoplasma florum and m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc did not contain these conserved sequences. the different hint homologues had the highest identity with the hint protein of m. hominis, ranging from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  % .

hit loci with a different genomic organization were identified in the mollicutes ureaplasma parvum,m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium . while uu <dig> of u. parvum, the gene immediately upstream of hitl encoded a putative p <dig> homologue possessing the p <dig> consensus sequences cs <dig>  and cs <dig> , it differed from all other p <dig> homologues in possessing a spase i recognition sequence and two other transmembrane helices . the uu <dig> gene, immediately downstream of hitl, encoded a protein with two transmembrane spanning helices, but with no significant similarity to other known proteins. the deduced protein sequence of uu <dig> did not have any sequence similarity with p <dig>  with six transmembrane segments, it appeared more likely to form a pore than to be surface exposed. the organization of the hit locus of u. parvum appeared intermediate between the hit loci described above and those of m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium. the sequence identity between the ureaplasma hint and the hint proteins of m. pneumoniae  and m. genitalium  was higher than that between hint of u. parvum and m. hominis , and the genes immediately upstream of hitl encoded proteins with seven  or five  transmembrane domains . mpn_ <dig> is predicted to encode a permease of an abc transporter  <cit>  suggesting a comparable function in m. genitalium and probably also in u. parvum. thus, these hit loci of mollicutes analyzed appear to have a hitl gene flanked by genes that are predicted to encode membrane-anchored proteins.

as in m. gallisepticum, the hitl gene is not flanked by other genes on the same strand, also exceptions of a polycistronic organization of the hitl gene seem to exist within the mollicutes.

organization of the hit loci in chlamydiaceae
in the obligately intra cellular chlamydiaceae the order of genes within the hit loci and the function of the encoded proteins appeared to be highly conserved, but distinctly different from that of the mollicutes . in all chlamydial species analyzed, the gene upstream of hitl encoded a putative cytoplasmic protein with the signature sequence of a metal-dependent protein hydrolase and a large number of metal binding residues , probably indicative of a phosphoesterase function, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding ob fold . the deduced protein sequence of the gene located downstream of hitl contained a 37– <dig> aa long tandemly repeated arm repeat fold , which forms a right-handed superhelix and has been implicated in the mediation of protein-protein interactions  <cit> . cp <dig> contained an rgd motif, which plays a role in cell adhesion  <cit> . however, the presence of rgd in a sequence alone is not sufficient to suggest a biological function for this motif  <cit> . the presence of two transmembrane helices  suggested that it is more likely that cp <dig> may interact with the bacterial cell membrane. in all other chlamydial species analyzed, the cp <dig> homologues did not contain domains suggestive of membrane attachment.

are the hit loci genes co-expressed?
in bacteria, overlapping genes on the same coding strand may indicate the polycistronic organization of these genes, and co-expressed proteins are often related in function.

as the hit locus of m. hominis is an operon containing three genes  <cit>  the next step was to analyze whether the polycistronic organization of hit genes was conserved within the mollicutes and whether this also occurred in chlamydiaceae. initially, we chose m. pulmonis, the species with the greatest similarity to m. hominis, for reverse transcription  pcr analysis. to identify the likely boundaries of an mrna containing mypu_ <dig>  mypu_ <dig> and mypu_ <dig>  two different primers upstream of the mypu_0060/hita gene and three primers downstream of the hitl gene were used . amplification occurred with primers binding just upstream of the predicted promoter regions  <dig> or  <dig> and just downstream of the taa stop codon of the hitl gene  indicating a polycistronic mrna. amplification was not seen with a primer hybridizing to the sequence downstream of a predicted hairpin loop structure after the taa stop codon of hitl  suggesting that the mrna terminates at the predicted hairpin structure.

next, we examined the genes flanking hitl in u. parvum. amplicons which spanned the intergenic regions were obtained with primers hybridizing to the center of uu <dig> and to the 3'-end of uu <dig> , and with primers hybridizing to the 5'-end of uu <dig> and to the 3'-end of uu <dig> . no amplification occurred with a primer hybridizing to the 5'-end of uu <dig> and the 3'-end of hitl . these data suggest that hint is expressed with the flanking genes uu <dig> and uu <dig>  these findings are in accordance with the predicted termination of transcription by a hairpin loop with a stem energy of - <dig>  kcal mole- <dig> located  <dig> nt downstream of the uu <dig> gene  <cit> . of the organisms analyzed so far u. parvum was the most demanding organism of the mollicutes in terms of dna-free, full-length total rna preparation. thus the detection of a common rna from the center of uu <dig> up to uu <dig>  may be due to an unstable rna or indicatory for uu <dig> not taking part in the operon structure.

to characterize the organization of hit loci genes within the chlamydiaceae we analyzed the locus in chlamydophila pneumoniae. the genes cp <dig> , cp <dig> and cp <dig>  which is predicted to encode a solute symporter family protein  <cit> , were predicted to comprise an operon. no amplification occurred when a primer pair that hybridized upstream of cp <dig> and downstream of cp <dig> was used . amplification was detected using primers binding within each gene  and with primers binding within cp <dig> and cp <dig>  and within cp <dig> and cp <dig> . the predicted co-expression of cp <dig> and cp <dig> downstream of which several putative transcription terminators were detected, was not supported by rt-pcr analysis , with amplification being obtained when using genomic dna as a template but not with cdna.

interactions between the proteins encoded by the hit locus of c. pneumoniae
as the stability of an rna is increased in regions with pronounced secondary structures, such as transcriptional terminators, and is often decreased in regions lacking such protective structures  <cit> , partial degradation of the chlamydial mrna may have occurred. the results from rt-pcr analysis of the mrna of cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> suggest an operon producing a transient mrna thus suggesting a physical interaction between the products of these genes. therefore we analyzed the interactions between cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> using the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> . the system is based on the modular organization of the transcription factor gal <dig>  which has a dna-binding domain  and an activation domain . when gal <dig> binds  to its cognate binding site, the activation domain ad is brought close to the promoter and activates transcription of the reporter genes lacz and his <dig>  in the yeast two-hybrid system these two domains, which alone are not able to activate transcription, are separately cloned into pgadt <dig>  and pgbkt <dig>  and expressed in fusion with the proteins under investigation. growth of a histidine dependent yeast strain on histidine deficient media will only occur after transformation with both plasmids if the ad and db domains are apposed by an interaction between the fusion proteins, which will result in transcription of the reporter genes. the plasmids pgadt7-t and pgbkt7- <dig>  which encode the sv <dig> large t-antigen and the murine p <dig> protein, respectively served as a positive control .

hint is known to dimerize  <cit> . we introduced the coding region of m. hominis hint into both pgadt <dig> and pgbkt <dig> and transformed the histidine dependent yeast strain ah <dig> with them. quantification of transcriptional activation of the reporter gene was achieved using a liquid β-galactosidase assay measuring the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β, d-galactopyranoside , yielding the fluorescent molecule 4-methylumbelliferone . as expected, dimerization of the fused hint peptides led to apposition of the ad and db domains generating a functional transcription factor. the transcription of the reporter genes resulted in growth of the yeast on histidine-deficient agar plates  and production of β-galactosidase . next we analyzed whether the proteins encoded by the hit locus of c. pneumoniae interacted. the coding regions of cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> were introduced into pgadt <dig> and pgbkt <dig> and expressed in yeast in all possible combinations. as shown in figure  <dig>  large colonies, comparable in size to those of the positive control, were produced by yeast that expressed cp <dig> fused to both the binding and the activation domain. this suggested a strong interaction between the molecules of the cp <dig> protein. all other combinations of plasmids encoding cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> only led to the growth of small colonies, a finding that was difficult to interpret. to differentiate between strong and weak interactions, the β-galactosidase assay was used. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the measurement of β-galactoside activity indicated an interaction between cp <dig> and cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> itself, independent of the fusion partner . surprisingly, dimerization of cp <dig>  was not detected, although cp <dig> interacted strongly with itself. cp <dig> did not activate transcription by itself  nor did it interact with the unrelated protein sv <dig> large t antigen  or murine tumor suppressor p <dig>  to activate transcription, as in all these cases the β-galactosidase activity was at background levels .

immune co-precipitation of cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp267
to confirm the findings derived from the two-hybrid analyses we performed protein-binding assays in vitro. protein c-tagged cp <dig>  cp <dig> and cp <dig> were expressed in e. coli and purified by affinity chromatography . each protein was then incubated with equal amounts of -labeled cp <dig>  cp <dig> or cp <dig> in vitro and precipitated with anti-protein c antibodies. as shown in fig. 7b, the supernatants of the different samples contained comparable amounts of the respective isotope labeled proteins. as expected the  labeled cp proteins alone were neither precipitated by unrelated membrane proteins, such as protein c-tagged oppa of m. hominis nor by the anti-protein c-sepharose itself . in contrast, an interaction of cp <dig> with cp <dig> was suggested by co-precipitation of significant amounts of cp <dig>  with cp267c, and cp <dig>  with cp266c . the other findings from the two-hybrid analyses were also confirmed as both cp <dig> and cp <dig> were found to dimerize and there was no interaction between cp <dig> and cp <dig>  interestingly dimerization of cp <dig>  which was not detected by the two-hybrid system, was demonstrated in this co-precipitation assay.

thus, we can conclude that the chlamydial proteins cp <dig>  cp <dig>  and cp <dig> have a tendency to dimerize and cp <dig> interacts with both cp <dig> and cp <dig> 

discussion
a remarkable feature of hint proteins is their ubiquity. they are found in all kingdoms ranging from mycoplasma genitalium, the smallest prokaryote, to one of the most complex eukaryotes, the human  <cit> . however the function of this homo-dimer in the cytoplasm of these different organisms has only been closely examined in eukaryotes, where it has been characterized as an intracellular receptor for purine ribonucleotides  <cit> , especially for hydrolases of 5'-monophosphoramide substrates such as amp-lysine  <cit> , with the histidine triad motif forming the α-phosphate binding site  <cit> . hint has been shown to associate with the protein microphthalmia, an important transcription factor that controls growth and function in mast cells and melanocytes  <cit> , to interact with the human cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , a subunit of the rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain kinase cdk7/kin <dig>  <cit> , and to act as a positive regulator of the yeast cdk <dig> homologue kin <dig>  <cit> . that it may not be the key regulator of cdk <dig> activity was recently suggested by analysis of hint-/- knock-out mice  <cit> . this led to the hypothesis that eukaryotic hint homologues are involved in the regulation of transcriptional processes by hydrolyzing related adenylyl-modified proteins  <cit> .

the observation that hint homologues are ubiquitous and that they are even encoded by the smallest bacterial genomes, suggests that hint was present at the cellular root of the tree of life and that its preservation is advantageous for the survival of cells  <cit> . however the function of bacterial hint homologues seems to be quite different from those of eukaryotes. in m. hominis hint had been demonstrated to interact both physically and genetically with a surface-localized membrane complex by binding to the p <dig> domain  <cit> . the data presented here suggest that the co-expression of hint with membrane proteins is prevalent within the mollicutes. comparable organization of the hit-loci was found in mycoplasma hominis, m. pulmonis, m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc, m. mobile and mesoplasma florum. analysis of further genomes will most likely lengthen this list. a genomic dna fragment of m. bovis encoding the amino-terminal end of a p <dig> homologue has been sequenced and this homologue is predicted to possess an spase i cleavage site. in m. hyorhinis, a nearly complete hit locus, encoding p <dig>  p <dig> and hint homologues has been found adjacent to a genomic region encoding the high affinity transport system   <cit> . the organization of the hitabl genes in an operon, as recently demonstrated for m. hominis  <cit>  and shown here for m. pulmonis, suggests polycistronic expression of the hit loci genes. however, it remains to be elucidated whether the encoded proteins have comparable functions to those already shown in m. hominis. p <dig> of m. hominis was recently shown to reside in the membrane as a precursor protein and to be secreted into the extra cellular milieu as a  <dig> kda smaller antigen. processing of p <dig> was suggested to be initiated by spase i cleavage  <cit> . while the p <dig> homologues in m. mobile and m. bovis also contained signal sequences for spase i cleavage, those in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc and mesoplasma florum were putative pro-lipoproteins. secretion of lipoproteins has been observed in m. hominis  <cit>  and other bacteria  <cit> , indicating that similar function may be still possible.

m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium each had only one gene adjacent to hitl encoding a pore-forming protein with homologies to abc permeases, suggesting they are part of a distinct phylogenetic branch. interestingly, in m. penetrans the gene upstream of hitl also encodes a protein of an abc transporter, an atpase  <cit> . the hit locus of u. parvum, which contained a p <dig> homologue and a gene encoding a permease, may have functions that are a hybrid of those of m. hominis and the m. pneumoniae groups. rt-pcr analyses infer the presence of a mrna encoding hint and uu <dig>  a p60-homologue, and a membrane protein of unknown function. thus, the interaction of hint with membrane proteins seems to be a common phenomenon in mollicutes.

a quite different situation was detected in the chlamydiaceae. although we were not able to establish definitely the presence of a polycistronic mrna derived from the three genes comprising hit locus, the overlap of the hitl gene with the upstream gene, as well as the conserved order of the three genes within the hit loci of chlamydiaceae, suggested a relationship between the gene products. analysis of cp <dig>  cp <dig>  and cp <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system and immune co-precipitation assays confirmed our hypothesis that these proteins interacted and demonstrated that they form homo-dimers. cp <dig>  a protein with large areas of arm repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> , was shown to interact with hint, a protein known in eukaryotes to influence transcriptional activation, as well as with cp <dig>  a putative metal-dependent hydrolase with a binding fold for short, single stranded nucleic acids. these findings suggest that in chlamydiaceae, the function of hint may be more closely related to intracellular processes than to interactions with the extracellular milieu, as suggested by the findings on mollicutes.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here demonstrate that hint proteins of the chlamydiaceae associate with probable cytosolic proteins likely to function in the regulation of cellular processes, such as nucleotide metabolism. this function would be similar to that of homologues in eukaryotes, where hint has been shown to influence transcription. the finding that hint proteins of the mollicutes interact both physically and genetically with membrane proteins may reflect a phylogenic shift towards a different function in this group, or may indicate an additional function of bacterial hint proteins. our future work will focus on decoding the intra- and extra-cellular processes that bacterial hint proteins are involved in.
