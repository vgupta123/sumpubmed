BACKGROUND
chromosome abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cancer cells. recurrent chromosome rearrangements, like translocations, are often found in various tumour types, and there is overwhelming evidence that they are key drivers of tumorigenesis  <cit> . balanced chromosome translocations produce gene fusions, frequently leading to activation and overexpression of a gene due to the translocation. the nature of gene fusions strongly correlates with the tumour type, making them very attractive targets for cancer diagnostic or therapeutic intervention  <cit> .

the first ever identified chromosome translocation in cancer was the philadelphia chromosome originating from a balanced translocation between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the philadelphia chromosome is a characteristic feature of chronic myelogenous leukemia and was found in most of patients with this disease  <cit> . at the molecular level this translocation gives rise to the bcr-abl <dig> fusion, thereby deregulating abl <dig> tyrosine kinase activity. as a consequence, downstream signalling pathways are activated and malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells is induced  <cit> . the bcr-abl <dig> gene fusion serves as a clinical biomarker for diagnostic and a therapeutic target for several drugs like imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and others  <cit> .

chromosome rearrangements involving ros <dig> gene have been found in 1–2 % of patients with non-small cell lung cancers. several fusion partners are known for ros <dig>  among which cd <dig> is the most common  <cit> . the cd74-ros <dig> gene fusion is formed as result of a balanced translocation between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in a way that preserves the tyrosine kinase domain of ros <dig>  <cit> . as a result of this rearrangements, ros <dig> kinase is constitutively active, rendering the cd74-ros <dig> gene fusion a potent oncogenic driver  <cit> .

chromosomal translocations are triggered in vivo by the simultaneous occurrence of double strand breaks. to generate such translocations in defined cellular models, we used crispr/cas technology  <cit> . cas <dig> is bacterial endonuclease derived from streptococcus pyogenes that can be reprogrammed by short rnas  to induce a dna double-strand break at any position that is followed by a protospacer adjacent motif  . repair of the double-stand break can either occur by non-homologous end joining or by homology-directed repair, depending on whether a homology template is present or not. the crispr/cas system has been used for genome engineering in a large number of species and for a wide variety of purposes . the technology has also been used to engineer translocations in cells  <cit>  or in mice  <cit> , but the overall efficiency by which clones were retrieved was not always apparent and the resulting cell lines were poorly characterized.

here, we employed the haploid human cell line referred to as ehap  <cit>  as a model system to engineer or revert chromosomal translocations. we generated the cd74-ros <dig> fusion de novo or reverted the bcr-abl <dig> fusion that is naturally present in ehap cells back to the wild-type state. genotyping of hundreds of clones provides a measure for the overall efficiency of the process. individual clones were characterized in great detail to assess the precision and robustness of the approach we devised.

RESULTS
to test the feasibility of engineering chromosomal translocations we attempted to generate the cd74-ros <dig> gene fusion de novo . in parallel, we aimed to revert the existing bcr-abl <dig> translocation back to wild-type state .fig.  <dig> strategy to induce translocations using crispr-cas <dig>   the cd74-ros <dig> rearrangement was generated by inducing a translocation between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  grna <dig> and grna <dig> were used to target wtcas <dig> nuclease to chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. primers used for screening clones are shown.  bcr-abl <dig> rearrangement was reverted by inducing translocation between chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig>  grna <dig> and grna <dig> were used to target wtcas <dig> nuclease to chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively



in both cases, we used a similar approach. we applied cas <dig> together with two guide rnas, targeting the two breakpoints that we wished to create . following enrichment of transfected cells using transient blasticidin selection, we isolated single cells by limiting dilution and genotyped clones for the presence/absence of the desired translocation. we screened a total number of  <dig> clones for cd74-ros <dig> and  <dig> clones for bcr-abl <dig> using pcr with primers spanning the newly generated junctions to identify clones harbouring translocation . for cd74-ros <dig>  we recovered  <dig> clones  that were positive for both the cd74-ros <dig> and the reciprocal junction . for the reversion of bcr-abl <dig>  we identified  <dig> clones  displaying the wild-type bcr and abl <dig> junctions . we also show feasibility of this method in diploid cell line hek293t .fig.  <dig> chromosomal translocations are generated at high efficiency.  schematic representation of dna breakpoints and primers used for pcr amplification.  overall efficiency of chromosomal translocations in ehap cells. clones were genotyped by pcr as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>   agarose gel analysis of pcr amplified products. individual clones bearing the cd74-ros <dig> fusion  or the bcr-abl <dig> reversion  were characterized by pcr from genomic dna. primer sequences are specified in additional file 3: figure s3



mutant clones 1g <dig>  and 4 l <dig>  were selected for further analysis at the genomic dna level. pcr analysis indicated that the mutant clones contained the desired translocation and that this translocation was absent in parental ehap cells . conversely, the original sequences  were only detectable in the parental cells, but not in the mutants. this indicates that the translocation occurred as expected and that each mutation/ translocation is present at a 100 % allele frequency in the resulting mutant ehap cells.

we also assessed whether the cd74-ros <dig> translocation and bcr and abl <dig> were detectable at the mrna level. clearly, the fusion of cd <dig> exon  <dig> to ros <dig> exon  <dig> was detected by rt-pcr in the clone 1g <dig>  likewise, both bcr and abl <dig> expression were restored in the clone 4 l <dig> . sanger sequencing of the rt-pcr products indicated that exons were fused as predicted without additional insertions or deletion . given the fact that the dna double strand breaks/translocations occurred in intronic sequences, this was expected.fig.  <dig> gene fusions are detectable at the mrna level.  left panel: total rna was extracted from clones 1g <dig>  or 4 l <dig>  and analysed for the presence of cd74-ros <dig> fusion or the presence of the bcr and abl <dig> by non-quantitative rt-pcr. right panel: schematic representation of generated cdnas and primers used for pcr amplification.  sanger sequencing of rearranged cdna in clones 1g <dig>  or 4 l <dig> 



we used spectral karyotyping  <cit>  and g-band karyotyping to visualize the engineered translocations at the chromosomal level and to also assess whether additional undesired gross rearrangements had occurred. spectral karyotyping and g-band staining revealed that the parental cell line ehap contained intact chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> that give rise to the philadelphia chromosome . clone 1g <dig>  which contains the cd74-ros <dig> fusion, acquired a balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> . clone 4 l <dig>  in which we reverted the bcr-abl <dig> fusion, displayed intact chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  confirming the reversion of bcr-abl <dig> translocation at the chromosomal level . importantly, spectral karyotyping showed that engineered clones did not acquire additional chromosomal rearrangements due to potential crispr/cas <dig> off-target activity. taken together, these results show that cripsr/cas <dig> system can be used to efficiently generate gross chromosomal rearrangements in human cells.fig.  <dig> clonal cell lines bear no additional genomic alterations. ehap parental cells  or clones bearing the cd74-ros <dig> fusion  or the bcr-abl <dig> reversion  were analysed by spectral karyotyping



discussion
chromosomal translocations underlie a variety of malignancies, yet definitive experimental models are missing. here, we use the haploid human cell line ehap to generate or revert such translocations. the method we use is efficient and works with surgical precision both in haploid and diploid backgrounds. by combining two guide rnas, we introduce two simultaneous double strand breaks that get spontaneously joined by the endogenous dna damage repair machinery. we speculate that cas <dig> may serve as a bridging function as it is needed to generate both breaks. consequently, the spontaneous fusion rate may be enhanced by using a cas <dig> that can be dimerized, e.g. using the fk <dig> binding protein  <dig>  and fkbp rapamycin binding  domain system  <cit> . alternatively, the two ends may be bridged using an oligonucleotide that can hybridize to both ends of the junction that one wishes to establish  <cit> .

while the high efficiency we observed is desired when engineering chromosomal translocations, it may be undesired in other instances, e.g. when engineering double knockouts. we suspect that at least in some instances, the simultaneous delivery of two guide rnas will cause translocations and other genomic rearrangements as unwanted side effects. while these can easily be assessed in clonal cell lines that proliferate almost indefinitely, they may be more difficult to detect in scenarios where cell populations are more heterogeneous.

we used the haploid human cell line ehap for the experiments presented here. in our view, this choice offers three major advantages, all of which are based on the fact that the cell carries a single genome copy:  genotyping is a lot more straightforward than in diploid cells,  reversion back to wild-type configuration is hampered because a suitable homology template is missing and  cell lines derived contain 100 % allele burden with regard to the chromosomal translocation. however, we believe that this approach would be equally feasible in diploid cells. to exemplify this, we transduced diploid 293 t cells with two grnas for cd <dig> and ros <dig> and detected both the cd74-ros <dig> fusion and the reciprocal ros1-cd <dig> fusion by pcr . whereas most people so far use the crispr technology for research applications, the technology also offers the potential to develop new therapies. as many translocations represent driver events of tumorigenesis , it is conceivable that crispr-mediated reversion of an oncogenic fusion event may become a therapeutic strategy in the distant future.

CONCLUSIONS
the diagnosis of cancer is increasingly based on the characterization of the underlying genomic events. for these diagnostic procedures, robust reference materials that allow the standardization across laboratories are largely missing. we envisage that cell lines generated here and in future will be useful as a source of genomic dna or mrna that can be utilized for this purpose, alongside with dna from an isogenic wild-type cell line. implementation of such reference standards is likely to increase the quality of diagnostic output and will thus represent an important advancement in the era of personalized medicine.
