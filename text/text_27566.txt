BACKGROUND
bacteria sense and respond to environmental stimuli primarily through signal transduction pathways, in which the canonical mechanism employs a sensor histidine kinase that interacts with a dna-binding response regulator to activate or repress specific gene transcription  <cit> . some cellular processes have been shown to be controlled by orphan response regulators or one-component signalling systems, in which a cognate sensor kinase has not been elucidated  <cit> . orphan response regulators have been shown to be involved in the regulation of motility and chemotaxis  <cit> , growth-phase-dependent responses  <cit> , virulence  <cit> , iron transport  <cit>  and oxidative stress responses  <cit> . for instance, one well-characterized regulon that appears to be controlled by an orphan response regulator in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> is the arca regulon, which regulates the cellular response to aerobic and anaerobic respiratory conditions  <cit> . the distinguishing feature of arca in comparison to the analogous system in escherichia coli is that there does not seem to be a cognate sensor kinase, arcb, in s. oneidensis  <cit> , suggesting that s. oneidensis arca may be an orphan response regulator.

our previous work suggested that a putative orphan response regulator, so <dig>  in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> may be an integral member of a metal-responsive regulon governing the up-regulation of genes involved in iron uptake and homeostasis in response to metal stress. the ferric iron uptake regulator  is the predominant mechanism by which bacteria regulate iron homeostasis  <cit> . evidence suggests an additional iron responsive network regulated by so <dig> in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  up-regulation of so <dig> at both the protein and transcript levels in response to iron and acid stress has been observed in a Δfur mutant strain of mr- <dig>  <cit> . our previous studies investigating the transcriptomic and proteomic response of s. oneidensis to chromate challenge further revealed enhanced expression of so <dig> under chromate stress  <cit> . in a so <dig> deletion mutant, genes involved in iron acquisition and homeostasis such as the so3030-3031- <dig> operon, which encodes siderophore biosynthesis genes, were consistently down-regulated at high levels in the deletion mutant. iron acquisition and storage systems are commonly up-regulated when bacteria are subjected to conditions of metal stress , and a link between iron transport and heavy metal sensitivity has been suggested  <cit> . it is possible that sequestration of iron prevents redox cycling between ferrous iron and chromate, which can lead to reactive intermediates and oxidative stress  <cit> . a consequence of this may be deficient intracellular iron concentrations that could inhibit growth. a cyclical response would ensue, resulting in up-regulation of iron uptake genes such as those involved in siderophore biosynthesis, which is similar to what has been demonstrated for s. oneidensis in response to chromate stress  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to examine the function of the uncharacterized so <dig> response regulator within the context of siderophore biosynthesis. we used a bioinformatics approach to map putative so2426-binding domains and biochemical assays to demonstrate the binding of so <dig> to predicted recognition sites. electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that a recombinant so <dig> protein binds to a putative so <dig> motif that exists within the operator region of the so3030-3031- <dig> operon. siderophore detection assays further showed a diminished capacity of the Δso <dig> mutant strain to produce siderophores, particularly in the presence of the iron chelator  <dig> '-dipyridyl. based on the identification of a fur-binding motif upstream of the predicted so2426-binding site within the operator region of the so3030-3031- <dig> operon, we postulate that there are likely multiple levels of regulation operating in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> to precisely adjust intracellular iron levels in response to cellular needs. these intricate control mechanisms appear to involve fur-mediated repression and derepression as well as so2426-mediated activation of siderophore biosynthesis genes.

RESULTS
conservation of so <dig> amino acid sequence among shewanellae
previously, we reported that the so <dig> gene of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> shares  <dig> to 36% sequence identity at the amino acid level to cpxr and ompr orthologs from vibrio cholerae and escherichia coli  <cit> . orthologs of so <dig> were also identified in a number of shewanella species. multiple sequence alignment of all available shewanella so <dig> orthologs revealed a high degree of conservation at key residues . the predicted phosphorylation residues  associated with the n-terminal chey-like response regulator domain of so <dig>  <cit>  are highly conserved among shewanella orthologs. another striking feature is the high degree of sequence conservation among the c-terminal or output domains of the so <dig> orthologs. this region contains several features of ompr winged-helix transcriptional regulators such as the output domain, encompassed by residues t <dig>  g <dig>  and y <dig>  <cit> . residues 204- <dig>  resemble the predicted α3-helical region of e. coli cpxr, which comprises the crucial recognition sequence of ompr-like response regulators  <cit> . moreover, it is noteworthy that the annotated 5' terminus of the majority of sequenced shewanella so <dig> orthologs occurs at m <dig> relative to the mr- <dig> sequence . previous 5' race analysis of the transcription start site of mr- <dig> so <dig> demonstrated that m <dig>  is likely the correct start residue  <cit> .

a phylogenetic tree constructed from the multiple sequence alignment in figure  <dig> shows that so <dig> clusters tightly with sequences from shewanella spp. mr- <dig>  mr- <dig>  and ana- <dig> . in a system-wide comparison of shewanella species, it was recently shown that mr- <dig>  mr- <dig>  mr- <dig>  and ana- <dig> tend to be more closely related to each other than to other shewanellae when comparing genomes, proteomes, gene content, and 16s rrna sequences  <cit> . these four species exhibit physiological characteristics consistent with their ability to adapt to harsh environments, which is a hallmark characteristic of shewanella  <cit> . strain ana- <dig> is most recognized for its ability to respire arsenate  <cit>  but has also been shown to harbor a chromate efflux operon  <cit> , and like mr- <dig>  mr- <dig> is a known chromate reducer  <cit> . synteny of other gene clusters among strains mr- <dig>  mr- <dig>  mr- <dig>  and ana- <dig> has been noted for other metabolic processes  <cit>  and cytochrome operons associated with metal reduction  <cit> . given the shared genetic and proteomic arrangements among these strains, it is likely that sequence-level relatedness will translate to shared phenotypic traits.

in silico prediction of the so <dig> recognition site
three complementary computer-based motif search tools--meme  <cit> , motifsampler  <cit> , and gibbs recursive sampler  <cit> --were applied to microarray data generated for a Δso <dig> mr- <dig> mutant strain  <cit>  in order to predict a consensus recognition site potentially bound by the so <dig> response regulator . the computational analyses identified a single 14-bp consensus motif in the input dataset . this recognition weight matrix consisted of two conserved pentamers  in tandem , separated by the 4-bp linker sequence 5'-ncag-3'. the linker sequence composition is not random in that positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the motif contain a well-conserved c and a residue, respectively . other two-component response regulators that also recognize a tandem repeat sequence include phosphorylated cpxr  and ompr-p. the closest known homolog of s. oneidensis so <dig> is cpxr  <cit> . intriguingly, the predicted so <dig> recognition sequence resembles the proposed cpxr binding box   <cit> . the mr- <dig> cpxr gene was down-regulated three-fold in Δso <dig> mutant cells challenged with chromate  <cit>  compared to a three-fold induction that was observed for wild-type mr- <dig> cells under similar conditions  <cit> . the cpxar two-component system functions in responding to cell envelope stress and external environmental stimuli, leading to the activation of genes involved in repairing misfolded proteins  <cit> . the cpx system has been implicated in a number of cellular responses including the activation of outer membrane porins  <cit> , stationary phase-induced survival mechanisms  <cit> , and ph stress  <cit> . given the activation of cpxr orthologs such as so <dig> during periods of chromate stress in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit>  and copper stress in e. coli  <cit> , it is suspected that cpx and analogous systems operate to overcome oxidative membrane and protein damage induced by exposure to toxic metal ions.

for the present study, we used an input dataset for so <dig> recognition site prediction consisting of  <dig> genes showing similar down-regulated temporal expression patterns in the Δso <dig> mutant  <cit> . as computational analysis showed, a number of these co-regulated genes were preceded by a conserved tandem repeat  and included genes so <dig> , so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  ftn, so <dig>  so  <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  viua, and so <dig> . the majority of these putative so2426-binding sites were located in upstream regulatory regions, while one site was identified in the so <dig> coding region near the annotated 5' terminus at position + <dig>  suggesting that expression of the so1188-1189- <dig> operon might be controlled by internal secondary cis-regulatory elements. in addition, two tandem 5'-caaaa-3' motifs were identified upstream of the so <dig> locus at position - <dig> relative to the annotated translation start codon , pointing to the possible involvement of an autoregulatory mechanism. interestingly, a subset of the genes repressed in the Δso <dig> mutant, namely genes with functions in iron acquisition and storage, also possessed a predicted ferric uptake regulator  box in their upstream regulatory regions. a potential fur recognition motif, 5'-aaatgatattgattctcgttt-3', was identified in the upstream region flanking so <dig> and overlapped the transcriptional start sites for this gene  <cit> .

adistance in base pairs of the start of the potential so <dig> binding site from the first nucleotide of the predicted translation start codon of the corresponding gene listed in the first column. bthe e-value of the motif is an estimate of the number of motifs with the same width and number of occurrences that would have equal or higher log likelihood ratio if the training set sequences had been generated randomly according to the background model  <cit> .

several lines of evidence further support the role of so <dig> in the regulation of iron acquisition in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  a recent study applying gene network reconstruction to mr- <dig> indicated that so <dig> clusters with iron acquisition genes in a distinct iron-responsive network system  <cit> . within this iron acquisition gene network were a number of members of the so <dig> regulon proposed here, namely, so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  so3030-3031- <dig>  so <dig>  and so <dig>  <cit> . all of these genes, including so <dig>  were up-regulated under iron-depleted growth conditions compared to iron-replete conditions. additionally, so <dig> was up-regulated almost 14-fold in a fur mutant, while genes so3031-so <dig> were up-regulated  <dig> to 11-fold  <cit> . a separate transcriptomic study with a fur deletion mutant revealed that the gene with the greatest expression change in the fur mutant compared to the mr- <dig> wild-type strain was so <dig>  which showed a 30- and 26-fold increase in expression at the transcript level under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions, respectively  <cit> . in addition to the enhanced expression of so <dig> in a fur mutant, this gene has been shown to be up-regulated under chromate  <cit>  and strontium  <cit>  stress.

the presence of a putative fur-binding sequence in the promoter region of so <dig> suggests that expression of this response regulator may be subject to multiple levels of regulatory control. identification of a fur box immediately downstream of the - <dig> promoter element and up-regulation of so <dig> expression in a fur deletion mutant are both consistent with repression of this gene by fur under iron-sufficient conditions. similarly, of those genes encoding transport and binding proteins, ftn, so <dig>  the so3030-3031- <dig> operon, so <dig>  and so <dig> are probable members of the fur regulon based on their derepressed expression patterns in a s. oneidensis Δfur mutant and the presence of a putative fur box in their respective upstream regions  <cit> . collectively, these observations suggest cross-regulation of iron-responsive and other metal-responsive gene networks in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 

so <dig> binds in region of predicted recognition site upstream of alca
given the potential overlap in the response of s. oneidensis to iron and other metals, we chose to focus on the s. oneidensis siderophore biosynthesis operon in testing the interaction of two recombinant versions of the so <dig> protein with its predicted binding motif. the direct involvement of so3030-3031- <dig> in the production of hydroxamate-type siderophores was recently demonstrated with deletion mutants within this gene cluster  <cit> . induction of the so3030-3031- <dig> operon in mr- <dig> cells under chromate challenge compared to unperturbed cells has been demonstrated using both transcriptomic and proteomic approaches  <cit> . in further studies with a so <dig> deletion mutant under chromate challenge, the so3030-3031- <dig> operon was significantly down-regulated  <cit> . these data, together with the predicted so2426-binding motif upstream of so <dig>  suggest that so <dig> directly regulates siderophore production in strain mr- <dig> under conditions of chromate stress. we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assay  to determine if the so <dig> protein was able to interact with the predicted binding sequence upstream of the so3030-3031- <dig> operon.

our previous 5' race studies demonstrated that the likely 5' terminus of so <dig> occurs at a methionine located at position  <dig> downstream from the originally annotated translation start  <cit> . comparative sequence analysis of so <dig> with the cpxr and ompr amino acid sequences from v. cholerae and e. coli showed that sequence homology between conserved receiver domains for these other well-characterized response regulators and so <dig> begins  <dig> amino acids downstream of the annotated start site for so <dig>  <cit> . this conservation is further observed for the shewanella so <dig> orthologs . in order to test the functionality of the shorter version of so <dig>  both the full-length annotated form  and the "short" form beginning with m <dig> , were expressed using the ptrchis expression vector system, which incorporates an n-terminal six-histidine tag for affinity purification. the his-tagged proteins were expressed in e. coli and partially purified from crude cell extracts by ni-affinity column purification . expression of the recombinant so <dig> protein was determined by sds-page  and western blotting , which confirmed the presence of this protein within the expected size range of 26- <dig>  kda. similar sds-page and immunoblotting results were obtained for the verification of recombinant so2426sh expression .

a digoxigenin-labeled dna probe spanning the predicted so2426-binding site motif upstream of the so3030-3031- <dig> operon , but excluding the putative fur box, was generated by pcr amplification and used as the dna probe in measuring the dna-binding activity of the partially purified recombinant so <dig> and so2426sh proteins. figure 6a shows that the dna probe shifted upward in the presence of recombinant so <dig>  with the shift becoming incrementally more enhanced as the protein concentration in the emsa reaction mixture was increased. no shift was observed with protein extracts prepared from ptrchis vector-only e. coli control strains, ruling out the possibility that the probe shift was due to non-specific binding of contaminating proteins. a comparable shift was observed for recombinant so2426sh , thus supporting our proposition that the actual 5' terminus of the so <dig> occurs at residue m <dig>  gel shift assays performed with additional dna probes upstream of the so3030-3031- <dig> operon as well as so <dig>  which also contains a putative so <dig> recognition sequence, showed a band-shift in the presence of recombinant so <dig> . although the primary focus in this study is the functional role of so <dig> in siderophore production, future studies will be necessary to analyze the interaction of so <dig> with additional recognition sites to further define its regulon.

siderophore production is deficient in a Δso <dig> mutant strain
earlier physiological evidence for the role of so <dig> in siderophore production was obtained using liquid cas assays in which relative siderophore production levels for the Δso <dig> mutant were compared to those for the wild-type mr- <dig> strain  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that the deletion mutant was markedly deficient in siderophore synthesis compared to the wild-type strain in lb medium supplemented with chromate  <cit> . lb medium constitutes a sufficient source of iron   <cit> . additionally, under iron-replete conditions, in which  <dig> μm fecl <dig> was added to the medium, there was no change in siderophore levels in the Δso <dig> mutant. conversely, siderophore production in the wild-type mr- <dig> strain returned to background levels in the presence of added iron  <cit> .

we expanded upon our previous physiological work by examining siderophore production under artificially imposed conditions of iron depletion. to achieve this, wild-type mr- <dig> and Δso <dig> mutant strains were allowed to grow in lb medium supplemented with  <dig> μm of the fe chelator  <dig> '-dipyridyl to simulate iron-limiting conditions. other studies demonstrated that a  <dig> '-dipyridyl concentration of ≤  <dig> μm had a negligible effect, if any, on the growth rate of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> and certain mutant strains under aerobic conditions  <cit> . similarly, we observed that mr- <dig> and the Δso <dig> mutant could grow aerobically at relatively normal rates in lb supplemented with  <dig> μm of  <dig> '-dipyridyl , indicating that environmental fe was not scavenged below a critical fe threshold necessary for growth. as shown in figure 7b, the Δso <dig> mutant was unable to produce cas-reactive siderophores at wild-type rates under aerobic growth conditions in the absence of  <dig> '-dipyridyl. this deficiency was enhanced in the presence of iron chelator . relative siderophore production by wild-type mr- <dig> increased sharply, attaining a maximum level at the 6-h time point following exposure to  <dig> '-dipyridyl . at this time interval, we detected an 11-fold increase in the synthesis of cas-reactive siderophores for mr- <dig> under iron depletion compared to mr- <dig> under iron-sufficient conditions . in the same 6-h time period, there was only a marginal elevation in siderophore production by the Δso <dig> mutant, which exhibited substantially reduced levels of siderophore production compared to mr- <dig> under iron depletion conditions .

the impaired ability of the Δso <dig> mutant to produce siderophores during aerobic growth suggests that so <dig> is a positive regulator of siderophore production in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  as noted earlier, several of the genes predicted to belong to the so <dig> regulon also have fur-binding motifs in their upstream regions. the likely molecular mechanism controlling iron homeostasis in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> involves fur-mediated transcriptional repression, which includes down-regulation of so <dig> expression under iron-replete conditions and derepression followed by so2426-mediated transcriptional activation under iron-limited conditions. this may explain the residual siderophore production in the Δso <dig> mutant. it is also possible that an as-yet uncharacterized secondary mechanism for siderophore production exists in strain mr- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
so <dig> is annotated as a dna-binding response regulator, but its specific function in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> was previously undefined. using combined in silico motif prediction and in vitro binding assays along with physiological characterization, this report provides an important empirical step toward describing the so <dig> regulon. we initially identified a putative so2426-binding consensus motif that consists of two conserved pentamers  in tandem. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that recombinant so <dig> exhibits binding specificity with its predicted motif within the 5' regulatory region flanking a siderophore biosynthesis operon. a Δso <dig> mutant was unable to synthesize cas-reactive siderophores at wild-type rates under iron limitation. collectively, these data support a function for so <dig> as a positive regulator of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 

in addition to exhibiting iron-responsive expression, the so <dig> gene has been previously shown to be up-regulated in response to chromate stress  <cit> . the up-regulation of iron acquisition and iron storage systems in response to metal stress is not unique to s. oneidensis. in arthrobacter sp. fb <dig>  a number of proteins with putative functions in iron sequestration, such as ferritin-dps family proteins, as well as reiske  domain proteins, showed increased abundance as a result of chromate stress  <cit> . copper has been shown to disrupt fe-s clusters in important enzymes in e. coli  <cit> . an e. coli strain defective in iron transport was also found to be more sensitive to chromium  <cit> . exposure to manganese in b. subtilis resulted in altered intracellular iron pools with subsequent expression of fur-regulated genes  <cit> . the reason for the up-regulation of iron-responsive genes is unclear. it has been speculated that metal ions such as chromate result in oxidative stress mediated through fenton-type reactions with ferrous iron  <cit> . up-regulation of iron storage proteins may help alleviate metal-induced oxidative damage by binding excess fe and preventing its interaction with other metal ions. it is also apparent that proteins with fe-s prosthetic groups as part of their active centers are primary targets of metal-induced damage. these processes undoubtedly disrupt intracellular iron homeostasis, leading to the up-regulation of iron acquisition and sequestration systems. the evidence provided here and in our previous work strongly points to an integral role of so <dig> in such iron control systems.
