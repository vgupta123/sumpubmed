BACKGROUND
when voltage-gated potassium channels are activated, the s <dig> voltage sensor helices translocate and rotate a short distance within a gating-pore  <cit> . this restricted conformational change moves a number of charges across the membrane electrical potential field. movement of s <dig> segments may be as little as  <dig> Å, and is augmented by the electric field being focused and swept across some of the n-terminal charges on each s <dig> segment as the voltage sensor moves  <cit> . the gating pore includes an aqueous canal, contiguous with the intracellular solution located at the interface of the pore and voltage-sensing domains  <cit> , that acts to focus the local electric field within the membrane across a small portion of the s <dig> voltage sensor  <cit> . a small, ~3Å, hydrophobic septum that acts as a barrier to ion current through the gating pore is maintained by interactions between s <dig> and the rest of the voltage sensing domain  <cit> .

the n-terminal arginine  in the s <dig> segment of the d. melanogaster shaker channel sterically hinders ion passage through the gating-pore  <cit> . substitution of the first arginine  in the voltage sensor with histidine, r362h, allows a h+ current to flow at hyperpolarized, subthreshold potentials  <cit> , while anr371h mutant allows a proton flux at depolarized potentials  <cit> . mutations of the r <dig>  position in shaker to alanine, cysteine, serine, and valine allow influx of a non-selective cation current, the "omega current", through the gating pore  <cit> . recently a gating-pore mutation in the sodium channel nav <dig> , has been implicated as the molecular basis of hypokaelemic periodic paralysis  <cit> . in this channel, mutation of residues r <dig> or r <dig> in one of the four s <dig> helices allows an influx of cations through the aqueous gating-pore along the length of s <dig>  the omega current in both cases is present only when the channel is in a hyperpolarized conformation. when the channel is in a depolarized conformation, the omega pore closes and the canonical ion-selective pore opens.

the flatworm channel n.at-kv <dig>  is a weak inward-rectifier that is open at hyperpolarized potentials, but exhibits mild rectification, limiting the efflux of potassium, at more depolarized potentials  <cit> . the amino acid sequence of n.at-kv <dig>  resembles other shaker superfamily channels, in particular the shaw  family  <cit> . however, the voltage sensor in n.at-kv <dig>  differs from other kv channels in that the first  and third  basic residue positions are not arginine or lysine, but histidine  and glycine  respectively . despite the highly conserved canonical pore domain, n.at-kv <dig>  is permeable to a number of cations including potassium, caesium, lithium, guanidinium and, to a limited extent, barium and sodium. this channel's low ion selectivity raised the possibility that the current mediated by n.at-kv <dig>  might be passing through a permeability pathway other than the canonical selectivity filter, and the presence of two unusual amino acids in s <dig> suggested that this pathway could be a naturally occurring equivalent of the modified gating-pore that gives rise to the omega current in drosophila shaker channel mutants.

RESULTS
ions are conducted through n.at-kv <dig>  by a modified gating channel
to elucidate the contributions of the h <dig> and g <dig> residues to the alternate ion permeation pathway of n.at-kv <dig> , we created a series of mutants, based in part on the shaker mutants created by tombola and colleagues  <cit> , that included a mutation to arginine, the probable ancestral residue, and constructed pair-wise combinations of all the mutations at h <dig> and g <dig> .

channels were expressed in x. laevis oocytes and their electrophysiological properties were evaluated. v <dig> and boltzmann slope factor were obtained by fitting to the delayed rectifier components of the current-voltage data.

four different single mutations of the histidine at position r <dig>  created a delayed-rectifier phenotype typical of kv <dig> voltage-gated potassium channels . two mutations of the glycine residue in s <dig>  also created delayed-rectifier channels. the fact that several mutations in the s <dig> helix caused a change from weak inward rectification to kv <dig> delayed rectification supports the idea that the wild-type n.at-kv <dig>  conductance is mediated by four modified gating pores, rather than the single canonical permeability pore. this hypothesis is illustrated by a homology model of the n.at-kv <dig>  sequence  on a recently developed model of the closed state of the rat kv <dig>  channel  <cit> . his- <dig> is one of four residues that are positioned at a location homologous to the gating pore . compared to the rat kv <dig>  structure, the smaller size of his- <dig> compared to arg- <dig> contributes to a potential conduction pathway at the positions of the gating pores .

each of the mutations that convert n.at-kv <dig>  to a delayed rectifier could contribute to occlusion of a gating pore conductance pathway by a different combination of several mechanisms, a) sterically blocking the pathway with a larger side chain , b) repelling cations by virtue of a positive charge on the side chain  and c) straightening a bend in the s <dig> helix caused by the presence of glycine at position  <dig> . neither of the mutated sites is close enough to the canonical pore for any of these mechanisms to directly affect ion conduction through that pathway.

based on the amino acid sequence at the canonical pore's external vestibule  we expected that ion permeation through the canonical pathway would be blocked by tea  <cit> . conversely, permeation through an alternative ionic pathway should be unaffected by tea. figure 4a shows that the wild-type n.at-kv <dig>  was insensitive to tea treatment up to a concentration of  <dig> mm. on the other hand the g331k mutant, which manifests delayed rectifier behaviour, was inhibited by  <dig> mm tea, as would be predicted by the amino acid sequence of the canonical pore. however, the inhibition occurs in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that the substantial difference in amino acid sequence between the n.at-kv <dig>  pore vestibule and the pore vestibules of other channels may be interfering with tea binding. these results are consistent with the shaker omega current mutants, where the omega current is insensitive to tea while the canonical pore is blocked by application of the drug  <cit> .

in contrast, the n.at-kv <dig>  wild-type channel was inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, by 4-ap , while the g331k delayed rectifier was insensitive to 4-ap . this indicates that the g331k mutant, which can be considered to be a back-mutation to a functional ancestral delayed-rectifier channel, passed potassium through the canonical pore, which was blocked by tea but not by 4-ap, whereas, the wild-type channel passed current through a different pore, which was blocked by 4-ap but not tea. we propose that in the n.at-kv <dig>  channel the gating pores are binding sites for 4-ap, in contrast to most other delayed rectifier channels, in which 4-ap targets the canonical ion selective pore  <cit> . although 4-ap has been shown to bind to the intracellular vestibule of the open canonical pore in the shaker channel  <cit> , in other channels it has been reported to bind to the closed state  <cit> , and in one case to two different sites in a snail potassium channel  <cit> . the wild-type channel failed to manifest a tea sensitive current even under large  depolarizations .

these results indicate that the wild-type n.at-kv <dig>  channel utilizes the gating-pores as permeation pathways. in this interpretation the single mutations that convert the n.at-kv <dig>  channel to a delayed-rectifier both block the gating-pore, thus preventing an omega current, and either permitting the interaction between s <dig> and the canonical pore gate that is necessary for depolarization-dependent gating or, possibly, shifting the voltage sensitivity of gating leftward, into the physiological range, by establishing electrostatic interactions within the voltage-sensing domain that tend to differentially stabilize the open state relative to the closed state.

the conductance-voltage curves of the delayed rectifying mutants are strongly right-shifted compared with other vkcs
since the modified gating pore appears to have evolved as the ion-conducting pathway in n.at-kv <dig>  it would seem reasonable that permeation through the canonical pore would have been simultaneously selected against. the most depolarization sensitive of the single mutant delayed rectifier channels was g331k, with a half activation voltage  of + <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, compared with g331r, with a v <dig> of + <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv ; v <dig> values for the other pure delayed rectifiers range from + <dig>  to + <dig>  mv. thus, it appears that the evolutionary changes that have created the gating pore conductance pathway may have also shifted the voltage sensitivity of the voltage sensor domain into a range that is so positive relative to normal membrane potential that the canonical pore has become irrelevant to channel function under normal cellular conditions.

conversion of the gating pore to an ion conducting pathway, and the consequent rightward shift of voltage-gated opening of the canonical pore, appears to be due to changes in both the packing of the amino acids in the voltage-sensing module of the channel and the charge content of the s <dig> helix. for example, both g331k and g331r mutations add a single positive charge to the voltage sensor, but the two have a difference in v <dig> value of ~ <dig> mv. this means that the channel with the smaller added side-chain, lysine, is significantly more stable in the open state than the channel with the larger side-chain, arginine. the straightforward explanation for this result is that the sterically bulkier arginine sidechain requires more energy to pack it into the open state conformation, and thus has a more right-shifted v <dig> value. in addition to the unusual residues at position  <dig> and position  <dig>  n.at-kv <dig>  also has unexpected acidic residues in the s <dig> and s <dig> helices. residues  <dig> and  <dig> are both aspartate, compared with the almost universal presence of glutamate at the homologous positions in vkcs. also, residue  <dig> is glutamate in n.at-kv <dig>  as compared to aspartate in the majority of other channels of this family . these acidic residues are central determinants of voltage sensitivity in shaker; they differentially form salt bridges with the basic residues of s <dig> in the open and closed states  <cit> . thus, it appears likely the n.at-kv <dig>  channel has undergone a number of evolutionary sequence changes that have created ion-conducting pores from the gating pore and moved the sensitivity of the voltage sensor into a range of voltages that are not likely to occur in most electrically excitable cells.

some double mutations of n.at-kv <dig>  manifest dual inward rectifier and delayed rectifier properties
the electrophysiological properties of the single r <dig> mutants in n.at-kv <dig>  are notably different from the drosophila shaker gating-pore mutants, in which ionic access to the gating-pore is permitted by r1s/c/v/a mutants while the canonical permeability pore also opens at supra-threshold potentials  <cit> . to further investigate the differences between the synthetically created omega current in shaker and the naturally occurring omega current in n.at-kv <dig>  we created pair-wise combinations of the single mutations. of the  <dig> pairwise mutants,  <dig> were weak inward rectifiers, one did not express, five had a combination of inward and delayed rectification  and one was a pure delayed rectifier.

interestingly, the only double mutant that produced a purely delayed-rectifier in n.at-kv <dig>  was h325r+g331k. the combination of basic residues at r <dig> and r <dig> in the voltage sensor shifted the voltage sensitivity of the resulting delayed rectifier leftward by  <dig> mv compared to the g331k mutation alone . in our interpretation, the addition of arginine at r <dig> and lysine at r <dig> re-establishes ancestral salt-bridge interactions with acidic residues in s <dig> and s <dig>  that together stabilize the open gating conformation of the channel and at the same time influence localized protein packing so as to block the gating pore pathway, thereby preventing the influx of omega current. since arginine in the r <dig> position of the h325r+g331r double mutant produced an inward rectifying channel, and the g331r single mutation produced a delayed rectifier with an extremely positive v <dig>  it is apparent that the larger arginine side-chain causes steric crowding within the voltage-sensing domain. in this model crowding could 1) selectively destabilize the open state relative to the closed state, thus requiring a very positive transmembrane potential to provide sufficient energy for transition to the open state and 2) contribute to a conformation that has a sufficiently large opening in the gating pore to be non-selective for cations.

double mutants with combined inward rectification and delayed rectification manifest ion permeation through two pores, with different voltage dependencies and drug sensitivities
g331k-containing double mutants  displayed a combination of the two permeation pathways . h325e+g331k and h325c+g331k inward non-selective cation current measured at - <dig> mv was unaffected by application of  <dig> mm tea, while the delayed rectifier currents measured at + <dig> mv were suppressed by ~30% in the presence of the drug . this duality in function is observed in drosophila shaker, nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  mutant channels, where a small omega current is observed at hyperpolarized potentials, while activation of the canonical pore at depolarized potentials produces a large alpha current  <cit> .

the delayed-rectifier component of the g331k-containing double mutants had left-shifted v <dig> values compared to the g331k mutant alone. the h325a+g331k mutant had a v <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, while the h325c+g331k, h325v+g331k, h325s+g331k and h325e+g331k mutants were shifted to the left by an additional  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mv respectively compared to h325a+g331k . the phenotypes of these channels were the most similar to the shaker gating-pore mutants where r1a/c/s/v/e permits current flow through the gating pore at hyperpolarized potentials, while the canonical pore opens at depolarized potentials  <cit> . however, unlike the shaker mutants, where modification at the r <dig> position has limited effect on voltage-sensitivity, the localized protein packing differences of the n.at-kv <dig>  g331k-containing double mutants had great impact on the voltage-sensing behaviour of the channel, suggesting that the wild-type n.at-kv <dig>  channel has evolved away from using the canonical pore. it is significant that all other combinations of double mutants produced only inwardly rectifying channels. these include combinations of mutations that singly produced delayed-rectifier channels , indicating that most single mutations were not simple back mutations to the delayed rectifier phenotype. the fact that no single mutation in n.at-kv <dig>  produced a delayed rectifier with a v <dig> that would function in a physiological range of membrane potential suggests that this channel has undergone several mutational changes since it diverged from the ancestral delayed rectifier. many mutations that produced a delayed rectifier individually, in combination, produced an inward rectifier with properties very similar to the wild-type channel. this suggests that n.at-kv <dig>  has undergone extensive evolutionary change that has selected for robust ion permeation through the gating pore-derived permeability pathway.

as in other vkcs, the voltage sensor in n.at-kv <dig>  has a number of basic residues that presumably move in response to changes in transmembrane voltage. as shown by tombola and colleagues  <cit> , as the voltage sensor moves in response to membrane depolarizations, the current through the gating pore diminishes. in our model of the weak inward-rectifier mutants, we propose that voltage-dependent movements of the voltage sensor that are insufficient to open the canonical, potassium-selective pore are able to re-conform the gating-pore pathway so as to restrict ion permeation through the gating-pore without blocking it, resulting in weak rectification.

mutations that engender only weak inward rectification cause quantitative changes in ion selectivity
the majority of double mutant n.at-kv <dig>  channels were weak inward rectifiers , although there is substantial variation in the amount of inward current relative to outward current . n.at-kv <dig>  is capable of passing a number of monovalent and divalent cations, including caesium and barium , which block the canonical conductance pore. guanidinium ions also pass through the alternative pathway in this channel, suggesting a large aqueous canal through the gating pore. mutation of the histidine residue at position r <dig> changed the accessibility of the gating-pore to extracellular ions. the addition of an acidic residue at the entrance to the gating-pore  yielded an inward-rectifier with the least cation selectivity of all mutant channels, with both caesium and guanadinium having approximately 90% of the permeability of potassium at hyperpolarized potentials . we hypothesize that side-chain repulsion between the negatively charged carboxyl groups of h325e and d <dig>  opens the aperture at the gating-pore and attracts cations.

the shape of the gating-pore pathway was drastically changed by the replacement of g <dig> with a proline  in the s <dig> helix. in g331p, all monovalent cation species were highly permeant relative to potassium, including na+. conversely, the hypothetically straight helix of the g331a mutant provided increased potassium selectivity, with an average permeability that was ~ <dig> times greater for potassium than for the other cations, with the exception of caesium . the selectivity of the gating pore pathway is related to ionic size and chemical properties as well as localized protein packing and side-chain interactions

when the conformation of the voltage sensor helix of the h325r mutant is constrained by the replacement of g <dig> with alanine, arginine, or proline, the permeability profiles of the gating-pore pathway were all qualitatively similar to each other . the three s <dig> double mutants, h325r+g331p, h325r+g331a and h325r+g331r all had high potassium permeability at hyperpolarized potentials and the relatively high permeability for other cations that is characteristic of the gating pore pathway. thus, it appears that the pair-wise mutations within the s <dig> voltage sensor disrupt the secondary structure of the voltage-sensing domain that blocks the alternative permeation pathway present in the h325r mutation.

CONCLUSIONS
the inwardly rectifying 6tm kv channel, n.at-kv <dig>  has evolved to utilize an ion permeation pathway other than the canonical pore, which is also present. we provide evidence that the alternate pathway is derived from the gating pore.

we show that 4-ap does not block k+ current in the delayed rectifier mutants that are sensitive to tea , and conversely, that tea does not block k+ current in the wild-type, weakly inward rectifying channel . we show that in channels that manifest a combination of the two types of permeability, only the outward current, at + <dig> mv, is affected by tea, not the inward current, at - <dig> mv. thus, it is clear that we are looking at two distinct ionic conduction pathways in this study, and that 4-ap is blocking the non-canonical pathway. the alternative interpretation, that the various mutations are acting by changing the canonical pore, would require fully reciprocal switching between 4-ap sensitivity and tea sensitivity of the channel that is also correlated with an unprecedented loss of ion selectivity by the highly conserved canonical k+ channel pore.

this unique permeation mechanism has evolved through changes to the basic residue content of the s <dig> helix, thus modifying the electrostatic interactions between the s <dig> voltage sensor and surrounding helices. the proteinaceous septum formed by the s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> helices, at the interface of the extracellular and intracellular aqueous vestibules of the gating-pore, is not present in n.at-kv <dig> . we have demonstrated that the accessibility, shape and function of the gating-pore can be modified, and that the selectivity of the gating-pore pathway is related to ionic size and chemical properties of the permeant ion as well as localized protein packing and side chain interactions.

these results raise a novel possibility for functional evolution of ion channels. the omega current pathway has evolved in n.at-kv <dig>  to produce a non-selective cation channel that is open at hyperpolarizing potentials. this is an example of a distinctive molecular functionality arising, not by quantitative variation of an existing molecular property, but rather by creation of a new molecular property. it may be that other hyperpolarization-activated, non-selective cation channels have evolved in other organisms by similar changes in one of the more typical voltage-activated ion channels.
