BACKGROUND
natural hybridization and introgression can play an important role in evolution, e.g. by formation of new species or increasing genetic variation within species  <cit> . hybridization is a quite common phenomenon in many organismal groups, particularly in plants  <cit> . however, the occurrence of natural hybridization is not universal, but concentrated in a small fraction of plant families and genera  <cit> . a well-known example is the genus quercus , in which many species are known to hybridize  <cit> . because of their propensity to hybridize the biological species concept based largely on effective genetic isolation can not be applied to quercus  <cit> . to overcome the problems with the reproductive species concept, another concept that relies on ecology was proposed with reference to oaks  <cit> .

the occurrence of rare natural forms with intermediate morphologies was often interpreted as the result of a hybridization event. however, within oak species, morphology alone does not allow to detect putative hybrids, since the parental species are not sufficiently distinct and possess a wide variability  <cit> . for instance, no single morphological feature can unambiguously distinguish q. robur from q. petraea. however, it is possible to differentiate two distinct groups and thus to identify intermediate forms by using various multivariate analyses . furthermore, defining the limits between the 'typical' and 'intermediate' individuals is often more or less arbitrary  <cit> . morphologically intermediate forms which are suspected to be hybrids are regularly observed in natural mixed populations .

various types of genetic markers have been applied in studies on hybridization of oaks. chloroplast dna studies revealed that the most frequent chloroplast dna variants are shared among related oak species which was interpreted as evidence for hybridization and introgression between taxa . hybridization as a mechanism of invasion by one species  into the range occupied by another species  through pollen swamping was proposed to account for the lack of differentiation between these two species  <cit> . however, a relatively low level of hybridization between q. robur and q. petraea was detected by paternity analysis in a mixed stand  <cit> . studies of hybrid zones using morphology and molecular markers reported moderate levels of gene flow between different oak species . recently, another study  <cit>  suggested that low differentiation between q. robur and q. petraea results from shared ancestral variation rather than high rates of gene flow.

so far, most of the studies dealing with hybridization in oaks were carried out in mixed stands consisting of two species . however, the higher number of sympatric oak species that coexist naturally at different sites in the eastern part of the european continent  provides new opportunities to investigate processes driving speciation, such as hybridization and introgression. here, we examine a natural community of four closely related oak species. in a companion paper  <cit>  the genetic variation and differentiation among the species present at this site is described in detail. the present paper will address the following questions:  does morphological grouping reflect the underlying genetic structure inferred from individual multilocus genotypes?  is there any evidence of hybridization and introgression between species?  is the level of introgression between species related to the non-random spatial distribution of oak species at this site?

RESULTS
morphological analysis
based on the assessment of six characters we were able to identify  <dig> types of pubescence in the data set . the most frequent types , with a total frequency of  <dig> %, correspond to those previously described in central europe . these types are taxa-specific and were used to discriminate between species. according to  <cit>  a 'typical' q. robur has neither stellate nor fasciculate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaf – type  <dig> in our study; the most common type of q. petraea has stellate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaf and fasciculate hairs solely along the mid-rib – type 2; the 'typical' q. pubescens has fasciculate hairs on the leaf, mid-rib, petiole and twig, whereas stellate hairs are missing – type  <dig> . q. frainetto can not be distinguished from q. pubescens on the basis of pubescence alone. the individual trees that exhibit type  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were classified in this study as q. robur sensu stricto , q. petraea s.s. and q. pubescens-q frainetto s.s., respectively.

sh – stellate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaf; fh – fasciculate hairs on the abaxial surface of the leaf; amr – fasciculate hairs along the mid-rib; omr – fasciculate hairs on the mid-rib; pet – fasciculate hairs on the petiole; tw – fasciculate hairs on the twig;  <dig> – present,  <dig> – absent; s.s. – sensu stricto; s.l. – sensu lato.

a total of  <dig> individuals failed to exhibit all character states of the most common types, and were assigned to the species that they mostly resemble – species in a broader sense . within the q. pubescens-q. frainetto group, the species were further discriminated following flora europaea descriptions  <cit> .

each individual tree was classified to one of the four species based on the above mentioned procedure. then we continued applying a multivariate approach  based on  <dig> leaf characters to test the first grouping of individuals to species. the discriminant analysis revealed three distinct groups . the first group consisted of all q. robur s.s. individuals, two q. robur s.l. individuals , three q. pubescens s.l. individuals  and one q. petraea s.s. individual . the second group included q. petraea and q. pubescens individuals, but also two q. frainetto individuals whereas the third group consisted of only q. frainetto trees. the first and the second discriminant function accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the variation, respectively. petiole ratio and basal shape of the lamina were the most important characters in distinguishing between species. as expected, only two species, q. petraea and q. pubescens, could not be discriminated on the basis of the leaf morphology alone. moreover, there was no unambiguous separation between q. pubescens and q. frainetto, and consequently the assignment of trees showing intermediate discriminant scores may be subject to errors. in contrast, the separation between q. robur and q. frainetto was complete .

in total, only six individuals were classified to other groups  by applying the discriminant analysis as compared to the grouping based on pubescence. three out of these six individuals were categorized as 'sensu lato' in the pubescence analysis. according to the assessment of pubescence and/or leaf morphology a total of  <dig> individuals  revealed intermediate or contrasting character states between two species and were considered as a separate group in the further genetic analysis . the number of unambiguously assigned  individuals to q. robur, q. pubescens, q. petraea and q. frainetto, was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, most of the morphologically intermediate individuals were located in the contact zones between species rather than in pure stands of one species or another .

the morphological classification was based on pubescence and leaf morphology, respectively. the genetic assignment used a bayesian method implemented in the program structure. individual's probability of belonging to each 'species' cluster is shown. s.s. – sensu stricto; s.l. – sensu lato.

additionally, we applied the discriminant function proposed by  <cit>  for distinguishing q. robur from q. petraea. this function relies on only two leaf characters: petiole length and number of intercalary veins. the species status was confirmed for all individuals from our q. robur and q. petraea sample, respectively. moreover, as expected  <cit> , most of the q. pubescens trees  were classified as q. petraea.

genetic analysis
a total of four chloroplast dna haplotypes were found in the white oak complex. the most frequent haplotypes, 5a and  <dig>  were identified in all species, although they were not evenly distributed among oak species . haplotype  <dig> was predominant in q. petraea and haplotype 5a in q. pubescens and q. frainetto, respectively. interestingly,  <dig>  q. robur individuals showed haplotype 5c, which was not found in the three other species. a very rare haplotype  was confined to q. petraea.

at microsatellite loci, among a total of  <dig> tests for linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci only  <dig> were significant . for isozymes, among  <dig> tests only in  <dig> cases the linkage disequilibrium was significant. markers in significant linkage disequilibrium were only partly located on the same linkage group. only  <dig> out of  <dig> tests for microsatellites  and  <dig> out of  <dig> tests for isozymes  showed significant deviations from genotypic frequencies expected under hardy-weinberg equilibrium  <cit> . thus both categories of nuclear markers were considered to meet the assumptions for applying the bayesian method implemented in the program structure to assign individuals to species.

assignment of individuals without any a priori information on morphology
for the first modelling approach in the structure program all individuals, morphologically pure species and intermediates were combined into one data set, without any a priori species assignment. given x, the observed genotypes, the values of log likelihood of the multilocus genotype data, ln pr, as a function of the number of clusters, k, were as follows: ln pr = - <dig> for k =  <dig>  ln pr = - <dig> for k =  <dig>  ln pr = - <dig> for k =  <dig>  ln pr = - <dig> for k =  <dig>  ln pr = - <dig> for k =  <dig> and ln pr = - <dig> for k =  <dig>  the corresponding values for pr reach a maximum for k =  <dig>  consequently, the structure program determined that four genetic clusters best fit the data in the species complex, which agrees with the existence of four morphological groups. there was a clear correspondence between the inferred genetic cluster and the species designation .

within each phenotypically pure species an individual was considered to be assigned to the corresponding species cluster when it has an equal to or greater than  <dig>  probability of belonging to that cluster. introgressed forms are defined here as those showing less than  <dig>  probability of belonging to their own species cluster and more than  <dig>  probability of belonging to other species clusters. however, because our oak complex consists of four species and the amount of genetic information may be limited for some individuals, there were another two cases:  <dig> individuals, evenly distributed across species, showed less than  <dig>  probability of belonging to their own species cluster and also less than  <dig>  probability of belonging to other species clusters ;  <dig> individuals showed less than  <dig>  probability of belonging to their own species cluster and more than  <dig>  probability of belonging to two other clusters . these individuals were considered neither assigned nor introgressed forms.

following the above-mentioned classification scheme, the fraction of individuals assigned correctly to their species cluster varied among species, ranging from 80% for q. petraea to 64% for q. frainetto. the amount of introgression varied markedly between pairs of species, however, ranging from  <dig> %  between q. robur and q. frainetto to  <dig> %  between q. pubescens and q. frainetto . the differences in the proportions of introgressive forms among species combinations are only partly explained by the mean geographic distance between individuals from different species. noteworthy, the proportion of introgressed trees between q. frainetto and q. pubescens is not predictable from the mean geographic distance between the individuals of the two species.

evidence of apparently asymmetrical gene flow was found between q. petraea and q. robur  but also between q. pubescens and q. robur .

furthermore, there seems to be no relationship between the chloroplast haplotype and the degree of admixture for each individual within each species . only within q. robur, the sub-group consisting of individuals with the chloroplast haplotype 5c, that is restricted to q. robur at this site , showed a higher proportion of membership in the 'robur' cluster  relative to the other sub-groups: q. robur – h <dig>  and q. robur – h5a . this observation may support the hypothesis that q. robur individuals containing the haplotype 5c are the last 'immigrants' in the area and that there was less opportunity for them to hybridize with other species.

the results of the genetic assignment for individuals that belong to the morphologically intermediate class are shown in table  <dig>  the species designation based on leaf morphology as compared to pubescence showed a higher correlation with the genetic cluster indicated by structure. however, there were only three instances of incongruent morphological and genetic marker discrimination.

incorporating additional information in the assignment procedure
next, we tested in structure whether any individual in each species sample is misassigned, i.e. incongruence between morphology and molecular markers, or is a first-generation hybrid between species. for this purpose, we incorporated species information into the inference procedure. each of the morphologically intermediate individuals was included into the species that it mostly resembled. according to this second approach the vast majority of individuals  were assigned correctly,  <dig> individuals  showed > <dig>  probability of being first-generation hybrids and only  <dig> individuals  were misassigned . the probabilities of being f <dig> hybrids were highly consistent across different ν values in two instances . however, the other individuals still have moderate to high probabilities of being first generation hybrids at ν =  <dig> . q. pubescens was identified as parental species in  <dig> out of  <dig> putative first generation hybrids. interestingly, only  <dig> out of  <dig> putative f <dig> hybrids exhibited intermediate morphologies . accordingly, results from controlled crosses suggested that physical appearance of hybrid individuals often resembles the morphology of the female parent . thus, nearly all putative f <dig> hybrids are located in areas of contact between the parental species and share the chloroplast haplotype with the neighbouring trees .

values represent probabilities. only the individuals showing a probability of being misassigned or first generation hybrid > <dig>  at ν =  <dig>  are shown.

the number of misassigned individuals was very small relative to the total sample size . however, for individual no.  <dig> the probability of being misassigned to q. pubescens is very sensitive to the choice of ν, which indicates that the amount of information in the genetic data is not sufficient to draw strong conclusions. the phenotype of this tree is typical for q. robur  ruling out any possibility of wrong morphological assignment. individual no.  <dig> is the only member of the q. robur population that does not possess any copy of the 'diagnostic' allele  <dig> bp at locus ssrqpzag <dig>  <cit>  which may also affect its genetic assignment. for the two other misassigned individuals , the probability of belonging to q. petraea and q. frainetto, respectively, was highly consistent irrespective of the ν value  showing a discrepancy between morphological and genetic assignment. indeed, it seems that the criterion used for classifying individual  <dig> as q. pubescens, fasciculate trichomes on the abaxial surface of the leaf, is not always specific for q. pubescens as suggested by aas  <cit> . individual  <dig> showed a marginal position in the q. pubescens group and was very close to q. frainetto according to the results of the discriminant analysis .

discussion
by using pubescence and leaf morphological characters we were able to distinguish between four closely related oak species in an area of sympatry. only a small portion of individuals  could not be assigned unambiguously to one species or another and was categorized as morphologically intermediate. many studies report a small number of individuals showing intermediate morphologies between q. robur and q. petraea . by contrast the morphological variation between q. pubescens and q. petraea was seldom studied and the results were contradictory. for example, a large proportion of morphologically intermediate forms between q. pubescens and q. petraea was detected in north-eastern france on the basis of thirty-four morphological traits  <cit>  and in switzerland based on observations of trichomes on leaves and twigs  <cit> . other studies using pubescence and/or micromorphological characters differentiated very well q. petraea from q. pubescens in central europe and italy  <cit> . our results concerning the morphological differences between q. pubescens and q. petraea are consistent with the later studies. reports of intermediate forms between q. robur and q. pubescens are very rare and rely on morphological observations  <cit> . we found several individuals that were morphologically intermediate between q. robur and q. pubescens and, indeed, some of them  were putative genetic hybrids . however, our observations suggest that apparently intermediate phenotypes between two species are not necessarily hybrids. therefore, the inference of hybridization based on morphological characters, especially in oaks which possess a wide intraspecific variability, remains limited and can lead to wrong conclusions.

the presence of four differentiated morphological species was strongly supported by the genetic analysis that also identified the same number of genetic clusters. in addition, the majority of the individuals were assigned to the species cluster they were classified based on morphology . our study provides no evidence for a breakdown of species pairs into a hybrid swarm and indicates the existence of reproductive barriers among species. however, the reproductive isolation is not complete, since a substantial number of genetically intermediate individuals was detected within each phenotypically pure species. interspecific gene flow and/or recent divergence of the species with retention of ancestral polymorphism  may explain the occurrence of these individuals. however, the spatial locations of nearly all putative f <dig> hybrids in contact zones between species  points to interspecific hybridization as origin of genetically intermediate individuals. even for one q. frainetto individual , a putative f <dig> hybrid between q. frainetto and q. pubescens, which appears to be located at a considerable spatial distance of any q. pubescens tree , several q. pubescens trees were observed in its south-western vicinity . the predominant location of introgressed forms in contact areas between species has been reported in other studies on oak hybridization  <cit> . contact areas might represent ecotones for edaphic and hydrological parameters being more favourable for the establishment of hybrids . at bejan, each oak species occupies a different ecological niche and environmental variation is mentioned across the site  <cit> . it was suggested that the success of an hybridization event in quercus strongly depends on the habitat conditions  <cit> .

the fraction of putative f <dig> hybrids was very low in the present study –  <dig> % . only four of them were previously classified as morphologically intermediates. similar results were found in a mixed stand of quercus lobata and q. douglasii in north america: only one of the three individuals that showed the highest probability of hybrid ancestry  was intermediate in appearance  <cit> . similarly, a very small fraction  of potentially f <dig> hybrids  between q. petraea and q. pyrenaica were identified in a mixed stand in central spain  <cit> , but in the absence of any morphologically intermediate tree.

interestingly, the asymmetric introgressive gene flow from q. petraea to q. robur is consistent with the model of asymmetric hybridization between the two species  <cit> . both species flower in synchrony when they cohabit in mixed stands  and evidence of long distance pollen transport was found  <cit> . controlled crosses have also demonstrated that q. robur and q. petraea are compatible and most of the hybrids were from the combination q. robur  × q. petraea  indicating a lower success of q. robur as pollen donor . the rate of introgression between the two species was estimated at  <dig> % which is relatively similar to the level of interspecific gene flow  detected by paternity analysis in a mixed stand  <cit> .

this study provides no evidence of extensive hybridization between q. robur and q. frainetto. first, no morphologically intermediate tree between the two species was observed at bejan. second, the estimated rate of introgression was the lowest among all pairs of species  <dig> % . our finding contradicts a phylogenetic study based on its sequences in  <dig> italian oak taxa that showed a closer affinity between the two species as compared to q. petraea and q. pubescens  <cit> . however, spatial arrangement of trees belonging to both species  and the low density of q. frainetto in the whole reserve may provide little opportunity for interspecific gene flow between these two species. on the other hand, the study of italian oaks is based on only one individual sample from q. robur and q. frainetto, respectively.

the highest amount of introgression  <dig> %  was observed between q. frainetto and q. pubescens. this result is consistent with the chloroplast sharing between the two species . according to schwarz's taxonomical scheme  <cit>  both species are grouped in section dascia which may indicate a closer affinity between q. pubescens and q. frainetto and a higher propensity for hybridization relative to other species. however, since the two species are not unambiguously separated by morphological characters , a wrong a priori assignment of individuals to species may bias the estimation of hybridization between the two species . the introgression between q. pubescens and q. petraea was relatively high ~ <dig> %  which is consistent with the low levels of genetic differentiation observed between the two species in italy  <cit>  and at bejan forest  <cit> . furthermore, pollination experiments revealed that hybridization between q. pubescens on the one hand and q. robur and q. petraea on the other hand is possible  <cit> .

an unambiguous genetic assessment of hybridization rates within a species complex would require highly discriminatory markers . such markers are very rare in the two white oak species, q. robur and q. petraea . the differences between the two species derive mostly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive genotypes. even though the nuclear genetic differentiation between q. robur and q. petraea is low, the two species remain separate genetic entities across their natural range  <cit> . considering the low linkage disequilibrium between marker pairs and their wide genomic distribution  <cit>  even the limited number of nuclear markers  is expected to reflect genome wide differentiation patterns among the four investigated species.

predominantly maternal effects, i.e. hybrids are more similar to the species of their maternal parent, may explain the presence of introgressed forms amongst the phenotypically pure species  <cit> . it has been observed in controlled crosses between q. robur and q. petraea that first generation hybrids at juvenile stage exhibited a leaf morphology that resembles the morphology of the female parent very much  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether these maternal effects persist at a later stage.

the maintenance of four distinct gene pools in an area of sympatry may be explained by selection against hybrids . the local site conditions would be more favourable to the parental species rather than to the f1hybrids, that are gradually eliminated until the adult stage is reached . furthermore, the small number of first generation hybrids compared to the high number of potentially introgressed forms also suggests a lower f <dig> hybrid viability relative to other hybrid classes. those hybrids resulting from backcrossing are more parental-like and would be better able than f <dig> hybrids to live under optimal environmental conditions for one species or another. our results are consistent with other studies reporting a low fraction of first generation hybrids relative to later generation hybrids in natural populations .

differences in flowering phenology between species can be a serious constraint for interspecific gene flow and may account for the pattern of hybridization detected in this species complex. phenology was not directly assessed in the study area, but observations on flowering time had been carried out in several mixed stands consisting of q. robur and q. petraea from the same geographical region  <cit> . the data revealed a partial overlap of the flowering period, with q. robur starting flowering earlier than q. petraea. unfortunately, phenological observations are missing for q. pubescens and q. frainetto, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has documented the occurrence of historical gene flow within a species-rich natural community of oaks. there was a very good correspondence of each morphological species with one of the inferred genetic clusters. the amount of gene flow between species appears to be at relatively low rates and does not represent a 'threat' for the species identity which has been maintained in this area of sympatry. genotyping of progenies using highly variable microsatellite markers for paternity analyses will provide information about the ongoing level of gene flow between species. this will also enable us to determine whether there is a decrease in hybrids' frequency between the seed and adult stage, due to selection events. moreover, collecting seeds and raising seedlings from the putative first generation hybrids would allow investigating the segregation of the morphological traits involved in species differentiation.
