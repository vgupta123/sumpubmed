BACKGROUND
plant disease resistance genes  are important components of the genetic resistance mechanism in plants  <cit> . over the past decade, several r genes conferring resistance to a wide spectrum of plant pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, viruses and nematodes, have been cloned from different plant species  <cit> . sequence analyses revealed that these proteins share a high degree of homology and have a number of conserved motifs. these include a nucleotide-binding site , a leucine-rich repeat  region, a motif homologous to the cytoplasmic domains of the drosophila toll protein and the mammalian interleukin- <dig> receptor , a coiled-coil  or leucine zipper structure, a transmembrane domain  and a protein kinase domain  <cit> . although a wide range of pathogens are involved, these r genes encode a limited set of proteins that can be classified into several superfamilies, including nbs-lrr, a receptor-like kinase, lrr-tm and tm-cc  <cit> .

the nbs-lrr class of r genes can be divided into two subfamilies  based on the features of their n-terminal structure  <cit> . these two subfamilies can also be distinguished  by the last residue, d  or w , of the conserved kinase- <dig> motif within the nbs domain  <cit> . the former corresponds to the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, whereas the latter corresponds to the non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamily of r genes. the ‘nbs’ and ‘lrr’ domains in the nbs-lrr r genes have different roles during host–pathogen recognition. the highly conserved nbs domains can bind and hydrolyze atp or gtp  <cit> , whereas the lrr motif is typically involved in protein–protein interactions and is responsible for recognition specificity  <cit> .

to date, eight conserved motifs have been identified in the nbs domain of plant non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr r genes, including p-loop, kinase- <dig>  kinase-3a, glpl, rnbs-a-tir, rnbs-d-tir, rnbs-a-non-tir and rnbs-d-non-tir  <cit> . the first four conserved motifs are common in the tir and non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies. the rnbs-a-tir and rnbs-d-tir motifs are specific to the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily. the remaining two motifs, rnbs-a-non-tir and rnbs-d-non-tir, belong to the non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamily. these highly conserved motifs within the nbs domain occur across different plant species, making it possible to isolate r gene analogues  from other crops using degenerate polymerase chain reaction   <cit> . at present, more than  <dig> nbs-lrr-type rgas have been amplified via pcr from a wide range of plant species, and they have been arranged in clusters similar to r genes in plant genomes  <cit> . some of these are closely linked to known r gene loci or form a part of the r genes  <cit> .

in recent years, the evolutionary patterns of nbs-lrr r genes have been investigated extensively in different plant species. for example, in annual species, such as arabidopsis and rice, studies have shown that tandem and segmental gene duplication, gene conversion, unequal crossing-over, ectopic recombination and diversifying selection seem to be the primary evolutionary modes of nbs-lrr r genes  <cit> . in woody perennial species , tandem gene duplication and recombination play major roles in nbs-lrr r gene expansion  <cit> . point mutations, small insertions or deletions and gene loss have been proposed as the primary mechanisms by which nbs-lrr r genes evolve  <cit> . therefore, the evolution of plant nbs-lrr r genes appears to be a complex process.

pepper , a member of the botanical family solanaceae, is an important vegetable crop worldwide. however, its production is affected because it is prone to many diseases. at present, three r genes conferring resistance to strains of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and root-knot nematodes have been identified from pepper  <cit> . of them, two genes  encode motifs characteristic of the nbs-lrr class of resistance genes. moreover, some rgas in pepper have been identified by modified amplified fragment length polymorphisms, nbs profiling and specific pcr amplification with primers designed from conserved regions of the nbs domain  <cit> . however, no detailed analysis of rga characteristics is currently available. in this paper, we followed a pcr-based protocol using r gene-specific degenerate primers and data mining to identify and characterize the nbs-lrr cargas and identify putative r genes in pepper. we also analyzed the genetic variations and phylogeny in pepper. functional divergence analysis provided statistical evidence for altered selective constraints during protein evolution between the two subfamilies and identified some critical amino acid sites involved in this functional divergence. analyses of non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitutions per site revealed a purifying selection in the evolutionary processes of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr cargas in pepper. several specificity-determining positions  responsible for functional specificity were also predicted. finally, the expression of representative cargas was analysed in response to hormones and in different organs.

RESULTS
identification of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr cargas in pepper
candidate non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr cargas were identified in pepper using two approaches, pcr amplification with degenerate primers and database mining. two pairs of degenerate primers, previously designed based on conserved domains  among known nbs-lrr r genes from other plant species  <cit> , were used. two bands of the predicted size  were amplified using the genomic dna of pepper . the bands were then excised from agarose gels and cloned. a total of fifty clones were randomly selected for sequencing, twenty-four of which were highly homologous to nbs-lrr sequences or known r genes from other plant species. these sequences were designated as nbs-lrr cargas. the remaining clones were homologous to either a putative polyprotein or a hypothetical lrr protein. this finding suggests that degenerate pcr amplification is a very effective method for isolating potential cargas from pepper.

a total of fifty-four cargas were identified using the key word ‘capsicum resistance gene’ in a search of the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant protein database . a total of seventy-eight cargas were obtained using these two methods. among the seventy-eight cargas, fifty-five had uninterrupted open reading frames  and twenty-three cargas had stop codons in the reading frames. these cargas may be non-functional genes. hence, they were excluded from further analysis. moreover, two r genes reported previously were selected for further analysis  <cit> . in addition, more than one hundred and seventy and four hundred nbs-lrr r genes from arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , respectively, were used to retrieve potential r genes or cargas from pepper. however, no novel cargas or r genes were found. the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of all these pepper cargas are listed in additional file  <dig> 

sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationship between non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr rgas
blastx searches revealed that the fifty-seven cargas had a certain degree of identity with known r genes as well as some rgas from other plant species. they contained the conserved nb-arc  domain of known r genes  <cit> . further analysis indicated that these cargas, except for carga <dig> , carga <dig> , carga <dig>  and carga <dig> , also included typically conserved motifs such as p-loop, kinase- <dig> and glpl.

to investigate the evolutionary relationships among the nbs-lrr cargas of pepper, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the region between the p-loop and glpl motifs using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis   <dig>  software  <cit> . the aforementioned four cargas were excluded from subsequent analyses because they lacked conserved p-loop and glpl motifs. thus, a total of fifty-three cargas of pepper were used for phylogenetic tree construction. six known r genes , downloaded from the genbank database, were also included in the analysis. the phylogenetic tree is shown in figure  <dig>  two primary groups, non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr, were obviously distinguished, which is consistent with previously described patterns  <cit> . the non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamily included thirty-eight members , whereas only fifteen members  belonged to the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily. these results support the view that both tir-nbslrr and non-tir-nbs-lrr r genes occur in dicot species  <cit> . within the non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, cargas could be separated into four subgroups, which were designated carga i–iv. in the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, the cargas could be divided into three subgroups, which were designated carga v–vii. each of these seven subgroups included different numbers of carga members. the carga iii, carga iv, carga v and carga vi subgroups contained two to four members, whereas the carga i, carga ii and carga vii subgroups consisted of eight to nineteen members. this result reflects a difference in the abundance of these rga subgroups in the pepper genome . the characteristics of these non-tir- and tir-nbs carga sequences from pepper are shown in table  <dig> 

we further revealed that sequence identity between the cargas from pcr amplification and database mining ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  at the amino acid level . this finding indicates that these cargas are characterized by a high degree of divergence. there were also different degrees of variation in sequence homology within each group. the highest value was observed for carga <dig> and carga <dig>   and the lowest value was observed for carga <dig> and carga <dig>  . carga <dig> and carga <dig> may have evolved from a common ancestor gene and carga <dig> and carga <dig> may have convergent evolutionary origins. compared with known r genes, the sequence identity ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  at the amino acid level . we also analyzed sequence identity between the cargas from pcr amplification and database mining and two r genes  reported. the highest value was observed for carga <dig> and cami  and the lowest value was observed for carga <dig> and cami . in addition, the blastp search of these seven subgroups revealed that their sequences had the highest degree of identity and similarity with known r genes or rgas from solanaceae crops. cargas i and ii showed the highest degree of similarity with the r3a-like disease-resistance protein gene from solanum demissum. the sequences of cargas iii and vii were most similar to mi- <dig>  from solanum sp. vfnt and bacterial spot disease-resistance protein genes  from s. lycopersicum, respectively. the remaining cargas iv, v and vi were most similar to the nbs-encoding resistance protein genes from s. aculeatissimum, s. circaeifolium and s. lycopersicum, respectively .

multiple sequence alignments of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr rgas in pepper
the cargas identified from pepper were obviously separated into non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies . consequently, multiple sequence alignments of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr rgas were performed separately. the sequence alignment between non-tir-nbs-lrr rgas and known disease r genes, including rpm <dig>  gpa <dig> and prf, revealed six conserved motifs  . similarly, alignment analysis with known r genes n, m and l <dig> revealed that the tir-nbs-lrr rgas also contain six conserved motifs  . the presence of these consensus motifs within the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr cargas provides further evidence that the cloned sequences are nbs-lrr gene family members.

analysis of functional divergence between the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr carga subfamilies
type i and ii functional divergence between the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies of pepper was assessed by posterior analysis using diverge  <dig>  software, which evaluates the  shifted evolutionary rate after gene duplication or speciation  <cit> . posterior analysis results in a site-specific profile for predicting important amino acid residues responsible for functional divergence. the estimation was based on multiple sequence alignments and a neighbor-joining  tree of the nbs domain of the pepper rgas, with clear separation of the two different subfamilies, non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr . the coefficient of type-i functional divergence  between the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies was significantly greater than  <dig> . this result suggests that the altered functional constraint between the subfamilies is statistically significant and that some amino acid sites are subjected to different site-specific shifts in evolutionary rate that can lead to a subfamily-specific functional evolution after diversification. compared with the findings for type-i functional divergence, the coefficient of type-ii functional divergence  between the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies was less than  <dig>  therefore, type-i functional divergence was the primary pattern for the evolution of the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies in pepper.

we further estimated the critical amino acid residues responsible for the functional divergence by calculating the site-specific profile based on a posterior probability  analysis of the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies. among all of the aligned sites, the qk values of most sites were < <dig>  . to reduce false positives, qk >  <dig>  was used as a cut-off to identify critical amino acid residues associated with type-i functional divergence between the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies. a total of thirteen sites  were predicted . among these sites, the qk value of site  <dig> was  <dig> , which was predicted to be highly related to functional divergence, whereas the degree of relation to functional divergence was lowest at site  <dig> .

we also found that the degree of conservation of critical amino acid residues differed between non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr rgas. for example, the amino acid residue at site  <dig> was valine  and leucine  in the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr rgas, respectively. nevertheless, some amino acid residues were highly conserved between the subfamilies, such as those at sites  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  from the non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamily and sites  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  from the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily . these results suggest that these critical amino acid residue sites are subjected to strong functional constraints within the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies.

comparing evolutionary rates among nbs-lrr rgas in pepper
the evolutionary rates were compared within the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies. the ka/ks ratio is an indicator for comparing evolutionary rates in r genes  <cit> . generally, a ka/ks ratio >  <dig> implies positive or diversifying selection ; a ka/ks ratio <  <dig> indicates a purifying or negative selection ; and a ka/ks ratio =  <dig> indicates neutral selection  <cit> . in the current paper, we found that within the non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, most ka/ks values were < <dig> in pairwise comparisons, with the exception of carga iii/cargaiv. this finding suggests that these gene pairs may be under purifying selection. however, carga iii/carga iv was under positive selection. within the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, all the ka/ks values were < <dig>  indicating that both subfamilies were under strong selective constraints . purifying selection could play a critical role in the evolutionary processes of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr rgas in pepper.

sliding window analysis
a sliding window analysis of the ka/ks ratios was carried out alongside the determination of the nucleotide sequences of the rgas for pairwise comparison of any two groups using crann software to explore important regions that may have contributed to the functional diversification of nbs-lrr rgas in pepper  <cit> . within the non-tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, we observed two groups of pairwise comparisons that showed similar tendencies. one was carga i/carga iv and carga ii/carga iv, the other was carga ii/carga iii and carga iii/carga iv. the remaining two groups showed different patterns. overall, the sliding window profile revealed at least three regions of high peaks that were under positive selection, given that all ka/ks values were > <dig> . within the tir-nbs-lrr subfamily, we observed 2– <dig> regions of high peaks with high ka/ks values, consistent with positive selection in three pairwise comparisons . these regions may be exposed to strong functional constraints. two of these regions may be located in the rnbs-b and rnbs-c domains, respectively. therefore, we inferred that the observed difference in the regions of functional constraint may reflect the functional specificities of nbs-lrr rgas in pepper.

determination of functional specificity positions among pepper nbs-lrr rgas
in plants, many protein families contain homologous proteins that have common biological functions but different specificities towards substrates, ligands, effectors, dna, proteins and other interacting molecules, including other monomers of the same protein. all these interactions must be highly specific  <cit> . thus, important amino acid residues that account for the functional specificity of proteins from a family need to be identified. these important amino acid residue positions are well conserved within specificity groups but differ between different functional subgroups. such positions are called sdps   <cit> . the sdpfox server was used to predict potential sdps and identify amino acid residues that are remarkably responsible for the functional specificity of the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr rgas of pepper . four sdps  were predicted to be involved in functional specificity. further analysis revealed that position  <dig> was located between the kinase- <dig> and rnbs-b domains. however, currently, there is no function associated with this region. the remaining three spds were located in three different conserved domains .

**p-value was used to evaluate the significance of the z-score and assess whether the observed z-score is sufficiently high to indicate an sdp.

expression analysis of cargas in different organs and in response to defence signaling molecules
to analyze the expression levels of cargas in the different organs of pepper, two representatives of each class were randomly used for expression analysis using reverse transcription -pcr. carga <dig> and carga <dig> were the only two members of class cargaiv. given that the sequence similarity among these rgas was high, only one pair of specific primers was designed using primer  <dig>  software. a total of thirteen pairs of specific primers were obtained. as shown in figure 6a, thirteen cargas were expressed in different plant organs, but their expression levels were different. among these, carga <dig>  carga <dig> and carga <dig> were expressed in the leaves, stems and roots at low levels, whereas carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig> and carga <dig> were expressed at relatively high levels. the remaining cargas were expressed at intermediate levels. no expression of carga <dig> and carga <dig> genes was detected in the roots. the cargav and ii subgroups showed similar expression patterns.

after treatment with abscisic acid  and salicylic acid , the expression levels of most of these carga genes changed. we found that the addition of aba increased the transcription levels of several of the analysed carga genes, namely carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig> and carga <dig>  by contrast, aba addition decreased the expression levels of carga <dig>  carga <dig> and carga <dig>  however, the expression of carga <dig>  carga <dig> and carga <dig> were unchanged. sa is known to play a vital role in plant defence against pathogens  <cit> . sa also induces the expression of a range of pathogen defence genes in plants  <cit> . among the cargas tested, carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig>  carga <dig> and carga <dig> displayed the most marked responses to sa treatment . the expression levels of carga <dig> and carga <dig> decreased. the remaining genes showed no response to the sa treatment conditions. real time-pcr experiments confirmed the expression levels of the selected cargas .

we found that two members from a subgroup may have different expression patterns, such as carga <dig> and carga <dig>  however, similar expression patterns were also observed . we also found that the cargaiv and vi subgroups had similar expression patterns. however, whether these genes with similar expression patterns have similar functions remains unclear. in addition, some earlier studies have reported that signaling molecules not only function as a critical signal for downstream resistance events but also upregulate the expression of r genes  <cit> . some carga genes were activated by sa and aba . this suggests that these stimuli induce the expression of the carga genes and that they may play a potential role in mediating cross-talk between signaling pathways.

in summary, this paper provided detailed characterization and data on the functional divergence of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr cargas in pepper. the mode of selection  among the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr carga subfamilies was identified by ka/ks analysis. however, the kind of evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the evolution of r genes in pepper cannot be inferred with certainty without the complete set of nbs-lrr genes from the pepper genome. future studies must focus on verifying and elucidating the biological function of these carga genes using supplementary experimental approaches, particularly with virus- or agrobacterium-mediated transient assays  <cit>  or by performing loss-of-function experiments, such as virus-induced gene silencing  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identified numerous carga sequences through degenerate pcr amplification and database mining. we divided these carga sequences into two subfamilies  based on phylogenetic tree and sequence analyses. the identified cargas are a valuable resource for discovering r genes and developing rga molecular markers that can be used for genetic mapping in pepper. we also predicted thirteen sites  as critical amino acid residues associated with the type-i functional divergence between non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr subfamilies. ka and ks analyses showed that a purifying selection could play a critical role in the evolutionary processes of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr cargas in pepper.

in addition, four sdps  were predicted to be involved in functional specificity in the non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr carga subfamilies. expression analysis showed that some carga genes were induced by sa or aba, suggesting that they may be mainly involved in defence responses activated by signaling pathways associated with these two molecules. these findings provide a better understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms driving the functional diversification of non-tir- and tir-nbs-lrr r genes in pepper.
