BACKGROUND
clostridium organisms are endospore-forming anaerobic firmicutes important in pathogenesis, human physiology , the carbon cycle and biotechnological applications  <cit> . c. acetobutylicum is the first sequenced clostridium and has evolved into a model organism for the genus. it can utilize a wide variety of substrates to produce metabolites useful as industrial chemicals and biofuels  <cit> . most of these metabolites, and notably butyrate and butanol, are toxic to the cells greatly impacting their metabolism and survival  <cit> . several studies have been published in the last few years aiming to understand the transcriptional and translational basis of metabolite stress response, yet the regulatory network beneath these responses remains incompletely understood at the systems level  <cit> . what transpires from the data of these studies is that the metabolite stress response includes virtually all annotated genes of the core stress program  response) but also many other large programs, including amino-acid and nucleic-acid biosynthetic pathways. such programs are apparently underlying the adaptive response of the cells to these toxic metabolites. this adaptive response includes changes in membrane composition, such as increasing the fatty acid tail length and percentage of saturated fatty acids, which is known as homeoviscous adaptation in response to the fluidizing effects of organic solvents and acids  <cit> .

many bacterial genome sequences have been completed and successfully annotated, but most lack information on the regulatory front of gene expression  <cit> . understanding the complex regulatory circuitry comprised of transcription factors  and their corresponding dna targets, including the motifs or transcription factor binding sites , is a fundamental requirement for understanding the complexity of responses in natural habitats and microbiomes, but also for building systems-level molecular models. integrated use of detailed experimental data and in silico analyses is necessary for reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks   <cit> , which improve our understanding of complex phenotypes and facilitate the development of novel strains using synthetic biology.

in this study, we applied a comparative-genomics, pattern-based approach to analyze a deep set of temporal transcriptional data to infer the transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying the metabolite stress response in c. acetobutylicum . using regulatory sequence analysis tools   <cit> , footprint-discovery  <cit>  analysis  was carried out, where the comparative analysis of the genomic context of c. acetobutylicum genes was successfully accomplished. overrepresented oligonucleotides  or spaced pairs thereof  were detected and assembled into position weight matrices   <cit> . these matrices were compared against the pwms of known tf binding dna motifs from three public resources: regprecise  <cit> , regtransbase  <cit>  and prodoric databases  <cit>  with the tool tomtom  <cit> . the results, together with oma  orthology inference in c. acetobutylicum for the genes available from regprecise  <cit> , enabled the prediction of many tf binding sites  and functional assignment of select tfs and their target genes  in c. acetobutylicum . together, results from these analyses enabled the construction of the stress response network involving the regulatory connections of key tfs and tgs engaged during stress.
c. acetobutylicum
.

first, we identify the common and distinct cellular responses to butanol and butyrate stress based on our comprehensive set of temporal transcriptional data. for the common stress responses, facilitated by target-gene predictions for the core hsp tfs, hrca and ctsr, we expand the list of class i, iii & iv stress genes. for the specialized stress responses, we identify the genes and biological processes that display distinct expression patterns for each metabolite. this, coupled by a genome-scale analysis of transcriptional regulators  differentially expressed under the two stressors, led us to focus on core tfs that apparently orchestrate these stress responses. we analyzed the tfbss and regulons of these tfs and examined the interconnectivity of their regulons thus arriving at a comprehensive picture of the transcriptional network that underlies the responses to two metabolite stresses.

RESULTS
overview: systems analysis identifies common and distinct cellular responses to butanol and butyrate stress
we use microarray analysis to examine the response of c. acetobutylicum to butanol and butyrate stress at mid-exponential phase  of ph-controlled batch cultures up to 75 min post stress with 15 min intervals . for each metabolite, cultures were stressed with three different concentrations: 30 mm , 60 mm  and 90 mm  of butanol, or with 30 mm , 40 mm  and 50 mm  of butyrate. these stressor concentrations were selected based on previous studies  <cit>  to obtain weak, moderate and strong stress responses. as described in the methods section, we used a reference design to collect the data. normalized microarray data were analyzed using significance analysis of microarrays  <cit>   to identify differentially expressed genes. we collected data from two biological replicates, with dye swaps for each of the  <dig> time points for each of the six stress conditions . thus, we generated a total of  <dig> individual sets of stress data for each metabolite. these data constitute an extensive microarray data ensemble capturing the response of c. acetobutylicum to these two metabolites. the design of the microarrays based on the agilent technology and the associated methods have been extensively validated  <cit> . this microarray technology offers extraordinary accuracy with many probes for each gene and multiple copies of each probe. nevertheless, the expression data for a select subset of the genes  were further validated using q-rt-pcr from a third biological replicate.

consistent with an earlier, lower resolution microarray study  <cit> , our data show that butanol and butyrate stress responses of c. acetobutylicum include not only upregulation of heat shock protein  genes, but also the differential expression of more than  <dig>  genes related to many distinct physiological functions and cellular programs . under butanol stress,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed ; whereas there are  <dig>  differentially expressed genes for butyrate stress . the union of the two includes  <dig>  genes, for which k-means clustering results are shown for the butanol and butyrate stress , respectively.

comparative analysis of the butanol  versus butyrate  stress responses is essential for understanding the general  stress response as well as the specialized, stressor-dependent responses. using fiva   <cit> , we identified the statistically significant differentially expressed functional categories based on annotated pathways  and gene ontology  annotations  for the c. acetobutylicum genome. each gene was assigned into one of four differentially expressed groups  for each stressor individually or in combination . then, the go categories and the kegg pathway classifications for each gene were utilized in fiva to identify the significant functional categories enriched for each differentially expressed group. in figure  <dig>  the venn diagrams display the most significant similarities and differences between the butanol and butyrate stresses.

the common & general stress response: expanding the list of class i, iii & iv genes
consistent with previous findings  <cit> , heat shock protein  genes  and other general stress genes were upregulated under both stresses . the general stress genes are classified into four different categories based on the bacillus subtilis model as class i, ii, iii and iv  <cit> . class i stress genes are under the control of hrca , and include groes, groel, grpe, dnak, dnaj and htpg. class iii stress genes  are under the regulation of ctsr  and include clpp, clpe, clpx and the clpc operon. the operon information used in this study is based on the predicted transcriptional units by paredes et al. <cit> . the hrca and ctsr regulons are described in detail in the following sections. class ii stress genes in b. subtilis are defined as those under the regulation of the stress-specific sigma factor, σb. as there is no known ortholog for σb in c. acetobutylicum , class ii stress genes are considered absent in c. acetobutylicum. nevertheless, based on the conservation of the σb regulated class ii stress proteins and using oma analysis, we identified  <dig> proteins in c. acetobutylicum that are homologous to the b. subtilis class ii hsps . among them, the only genes that were differentially upregulated  belong to class iii in c. acetobutylicum, and the rest show weak differential expression, thus further supporting the absence of class ii hsp regulation in c. acetobutylicum. class iv stress genes are defined as the stress related genes that are not under the control of hrca, σb or ctsr.  <dig> genes that were overexpressed under both butanol and butyrate stress , but that they were not identified as class i or iii genes, were thus identified as class iv stress genes in c. acetobutylicum . this is a much larger list than previously identified in this organism  <cit>  or any clostridium. this large class iv set includes genes from carbohydrate metabolism, histidine metabolism, the sol-locus genes , genes related to biosynthesis of membrane and cell-wall components, and stress responsive transcriptional regulators/factors .

the two hsp regulons: the core of the stress response
we used a pattern-based approach combined with expression and functional profiling to infer potential tfbss in the c. acetobutylicum genome, thereby predicting transcriptional regulations and reconstructing stress response network . successful identification of tfbss for many c. acetobutylicum genes suggests good similarity of binding motifs between clostridium organisms and other gram+ bacteria. among them, hrca and ctsr are the two tfs orchestrating the core hsp response.

the hrca regulon
parts of the hrca and ctsr regulons in c. acetobutylicum have been examined previously. notably, it was shown that the dnakj and groesl operons are hrca dependent  <cit> , whereas hsp <dig> is not  <cit> . our sequence analysis indicates that phylogenetically conserved hrca binding sites are present upstream of four operons: hrca-grpe-dnak-dnaj , groesl , cac <dig> and htpg  , with the first two corroborated by bahl et al. <cit> . all these operons, except for cac <dig>  were highly overexpressed during the time course of all the tested butanol and butyrate stresses in this study, which is consistent with previous reports. although its hrca binding site is the same as for its adjacent groesl operon, cac <dig> shows significantly weaker overexpression than the other genes  <cit> , thus suggesting that it is regulated by an additional tf. the function of the membrane protein cac <dig> or any of its orthologs is unknown. overall, the function of hrca in c. acetobutylicum is likely similar to that in many other well studied organisms, which is to maintain low basal levels of expression of the dnak, dnaj, groesl and htpg operons in the absence of stress  <cit> . upon exposure to stress, these operons are no longer repressed and instead get strongly upregulated. the underlying regulatory mechanism is apparently complex because when hrca transcription is upregulated, it should lead to the synthesis of more hrca repressor protein and therefore the repression of these operons should get stronger. but this is in contrast to the fact that these operons get upregulated at the same time as hrca is upregulated. in b. subtilis, complex post-transcriptional regulations of the hrca operon, based on mrna processing and stability, ensures the production of the operon’s proteins in the amounts needed by the cell  <cit> . additionally, hrca is activated by the free groesl protein complex under normal conditions, but during stress, titration of groesl by unfolded proteins constrains hrca activation, thus ensuring additional post-translational control  <cit> .

the ctsr regulon
phylogenetic footprinting analysis of the c. acetobutylicum genome revealed the presence of ctsr operator sites upstream of ctsr-yach-yaci-clpc  and hsp <dig>   <cit> . by obtaining the c. acetobutylicum orthologs for all the target genes of ctsr regulons in regprecise, we found additional putative target genes in c. acetobutylicum, including the operon of sms-disa  and hrca-grpe-dnak-dnaj  , whose tfbss are less similar to ctsr dna motifs  than those of ctsr and hsp <dig> operons. their gene expression patterns align well with ctsr and hsp <dig> . the presence of ctsr binding site upstream of hrca operon confirms the presence of secondary control of the dnak operon by homuth et. al.   <cit> , leading to a cross regulation of ctsr and hrca, which has been observed in other gram positive organisms  <cit> . sms  codes for an ortholog for the dna repair protein rada in b. subtilis str.  <dig>  which may play a role in the repair of endogenous alkylation damage  <cit> . disa  likely participates in a dna-damage check-point that is active prior to asymmetric division when dna is damaged, like in b. subtilis <cit> . disa in b. subtilis forms globular foci that rapidly scan along the chromosomes during sporulation, searching for lesions. when a lesion is present, disa pauses at the lesion site. this triggers a cellular response that culminates in a temporary block in sporulation initiation  <cit> . ctsr, although a repressor of hsps, was observed to have higher expression of its transcripts during the onset of stress, similar to hrca. repression of ctsr under stress is overcome by its inactivation through phosphorylation of arginine residues by yaci. yaci under normal conditions is bound to clpc, but is activated under stress by yach  <cit> .

stressor-dependent stress responses
overview
many genes in the cog  category of amino acid transport and metabolism displayed different patterns of expression under the two stresses. some of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of arginine, histidine and tryptophan, and these are discussed in detail below. while some purine metabolism-related genes  were upregulated under both stresses, some of the other genes  were upregulated under butyrate stress, but downregulated under butanol stress.

other sets of genes that display different expression patterns under the two stresses are genes involved in atp synthesis genes, cobalamin biosynthesis, and ribosomal protein genes. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> genes  , involved in atp synthesis coupled to proton transport, were upregulated under butyrate stress only. nine genes involved in polysaccharide catabolic processes  were upregulated under butanol stress only, with a few genes among them also upregulated by transient butanol pulse in chemostat cells  <cit> . the majority of the genes involved in cobalamin biosynthesis were down-regulated under butyrate stress but not under butanol stress, which is consistent with a previous study  <cit> . they include  <dig> genes, cbim, cbig, cobt, cbip, cobb, cbic, cbid, cbit, cobi/cbil, cbif/cobm, cbih/cobj, cobu, cobs and cobc, which are part of the cac1365-cac <dig> operon. this suggests a lowered need for cobalamin for the strain under butyrate stress. cobalamin is a necessary cofactor for various reactions involving rearrangements including glycerol dehydratases for glycerol metabolism and transmethylation for the formation of methionine from homocysteine  <cit> .  <dig> out of  <dig> ribosomal protein-encoding genes were downregulated under butyrate stress. among them,  <dig> were only downregulated under butyrate stress but not so under butanol stress . these data suggest that translation is suppressed during butyrate stress at all three stressor levels , consistent with the previous studies  <cit> .

amino- and nucleic-acid biosynthesis

arginine biosynthesis
 related genes , argg-argh , argb-argd , argc-argj , carb , cara  and cac <dig> ) exhibited dose- and time-dependent expression for both butanol and butyrate stresses . for example, their expression was more strongly upregulated at the low compared to high butyrate stress. in addition, they show different expression patterns from those reported by alsaker et al. in  <dig>  <cit>  when comparing the low and medium levels of butyrate stress at  <dig>   <dig>  and 60 min post stress. these differences can be ascribed to the different experimental conditions used in the two studies. in the  <dig> study, clostridial growth medium  containing yeast extract was used without ph control in static-flask cultures, whereas in the current study, a defined medium was employed in agitated bioreactors with ph controlled at  <dig> . based on the fact that butyrate inhibition is ph dependent  <cit> , and that ph-dependent growth play a crucial role in the cellular adaptation  <cit> , our assessment is that these difference are predominantly due to the impact of ph, but also perhaps the presence of arginine or intermediates of its biosynthesis in the complex cgm medium. in escherichia coli, and several other organisms, the arginine decarboxylase/antiporter-dependent acid-resistance  system  <dig>   <cit> , is one of the four known ar systems protecting cells from acid stress. but as already discussed  <cit> , there are no ortholog genes to these or the other ar systems in c. acetobutylicum. nevertheless arginine biosynthesis and transport in combination with culture ph apparently play an important role in carboxylic acid stress.

nine genes involved in 
histidine biosynthesis
  displayed complex expression patterns post stress . interestingly, induction of genes for histidine biosynthesis has recently been shown to contribute to acid tolerance in lactobacillus casei <cit> . in addition, a histidine decarboxylation pathway introduced in lactococcus lactis improved survival to acid stress  <cit> .

similarly, the 
tryptophan biosynthesis
 genes in the cac3163-cac <dig> operon  show strong dose dependence on butanol concentration , where low butanol stress leads to strong overexpression at the early timepoints, but mostly to downregulation for medium and high butanol stress. under ethanol stress, tryptophan genes were reported to be upregulated and functionally tested in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . for butyrate stress, there was upregulation for all  <dig> levels of stress, which is unlike the alsaker et al.  <dig> study, where a weak downregulation was found under butyrate stress  <cit> . as discussed, these differences may be related to the presence of yeast extract and the lack of ph control in the  <dig> study. 
cysteine metabolism
 genes also show a butyrate dose-dependent expression .

the branched-chain amino acids  are involved in the synthesis of branched chain fatty acids through the formation of α-keto acids. it has been suggested  <cit>  that bcaas are incorporated into membrane components to generate more rigid membrane aiming to counteract the solvation effect of toxicity solvents. homeoviscous membrane changes involving modifications of membrane fatty acid composition to counteract the fluidizing effects of butanol and other solvents have been extensively discussed in the literature  <cit> . in streptococcus murants, the bcaa aminotransferase encoded by ilve was shown to protect against acid stress  <cit> . thus, bcaas may serve in multiple roles in dealing with both solvent and acid toxicity. the genes ilvc  and leuc-leud-leub-ilvd-ilvb  are involved in 
valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis
. under butanol stress , expression of these bcaa genes is dose dependent displaying stronger upregulation at high butanol levels compared to low or medium levels. these genes display a more complex pattern under butyrate stress, with significant downregulation under high stress.

several genes involved in 
purine metabolism
 , including pure- purc , purf-purm-purn-purh , purd  and purq/purl , displayed distinct expression patterns for different butanol stress levels: at low and medium levels of butanol, these genes were weakly upregulated while at high level of butanol, they were downregulated. the response of these genes to butyrate stresses was strong in this study, and displayed different kinetics and strengths compared to results from alsaker et al. <cit> . here, these genes show the strongest upregulation at high butyrate stress level, which may suggest their involvement in acid resistance. insertional mutagenesis of the lactococcus lactis purine metabolism gene guaa led to increased acid resistance  <cit> . purine metabolism also shares a large number of genes and pathway intermediates with histidine metabolism, which, as already discussed, were also found to be differentially expressed under stress. it is noteworthy that metabolic pools  impact acid tolerance  <cit> .

differential expression of transcriptional regulators: overview
given that the two stressors elicit several common but also many distinct responses per our discussion above, we aimed next to identify the tfs that might orchestrate these responses. the expression profile for the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed trs in c. acetobutylicum is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  k-means clustering of these  <dig> trs identified common and distinct expression patterns for trs under the two metabolite stresses. clusters containing trs that are upregulated  and downregulated  at the same time under both stresses can be linked to general stress response, while clusters consisting of trs with distinct expression patterns for each stress  are involved in orchestrating the stressor-specific response.

because a large fraction of the aforementioned  <dig> trs remain non-annotated , we used phylogenetic footprinting and comparison with regprecise dna motifs , and thus many tfbss were successfully identified in c. acetobutylicum, and are shown in various figures. many such identified tfbss correspond to a subset of the core tfs in bacillales. these include regulators that control the metabolism of amino acids and nitrogen , carbohydrates , biotin cofactor , fatty acids  and nucleotides . these regulators also include tfs for metal homeostasis , respiration , sporulation , stress responses , as well as the chromosomal replication initiation regulator dnaa  <cit> . next, we focus on selected regulators with target genes significantly differentially expressed, per our discussion above, in butanol and/or butyrate stressed c. acetobutylicum. we start with the three stress-related regulators, which, unlike ctsr and hrca, have not yet been examined at the systems level in clostridium. we then discuss transcriptional regulators of amino acid and purine metabolism that appear to be part of the specialized metabolite stress response.

the core stress-associated transcription factors engaged in the butanol and butyrate stress response
lexa
lexa is well-known as the primary tf controlling the sos response, which is an inducible dna repair system that allows bacteria to survive sudden increases in dna damage  <cit> . even though it has been well studied in many bacteria, the lexa regulon has not been examined in c. acetobutylicum so far. therefore it was important to examine which genes might be under lexa control in c. acetobutylicum and whether these sos response genes are differentially regulated under butanol or butyrate stress. butyrate stress, in particular, may cause acid-induced dna damage, which is frequently compared to oxidative stress  <cit> . rsat footprint analysis led to the identification of four genes/operons with highly conserved cis-elements in their promoter regions that include lexa binding sites known as sos boxes  <cit> . these are lexa , reca , uvrb-uvra-cac0504-cac0505-cac0506-cac0507-uvrc-cac0509-murb , and cac3343-cac <dig>  in addition, the orthologs in c. acetobutylicum for all target genes in lexa regulons from regprecise were collected using oma search, and scanned for lexa binding site in their operon leader sequences. the operons with an identifiable lexa binding site  were collected and the microarray data for their gene members are shown in figure  <dig>  hierarchical clustering shows that lexa, reca and the uvrb operon are clustered well. this is consistent with the possibility that they are functionally correlated, like in other well studied bacteria  <cit> . moreover, even though no ortholog of cac <dig> was listed as under lexa control in regprecise, our footprinting analysis together with expression data suggests that the cac3343-cac <dig> operon is also putatively controlled by lexa. cac <dig> encodes a putative dna modification/repair radical sam protein and cac <dig> encodes a protein of unknown function. in addition, the operon of sbcd-sbcc  is clustered closely to reca, and its promoter region shows a potential lexa binding site . the uvrabc repair system catalyzes the recognition and processing of dna lesions. a damage recognition complex composed of  <dig> uvra and  <dig> uvrb subunits scans dna for abnormalities. regulation of the uvrabc system by lexa is well established in many bacteria, including e. coli and b. subtilis <cit> , but has not been examined in clostridium. the more significant upregulation of uvrb under butyrate stress compared to butanol stress suggests that dna damage may be more prevalent under butyrate stress. as discussed, butyrate stress affects the cells similar to oxidative stress by damaging dna, proteins and lipids  <cit> . therefore, we conclude that the lexa regulon in c. acetobutylicum contains at least the following genes/operons : lexa , reca , uvrb-uvra-cac0504-cac0505-cac0506-cac0507-uvrc-cac0509-murb , cac3343-cac <dig>  and sbcd-sbcc .

rex: the redox sensor
rex  is a member for the rex family, which includes regulators that modulate transcription in response to changes in cellular nadh/nad + levels and more generally the redox state  <cit> . it was previously demonstrated that rex is a redox-sensing transcriptional repressor that regulates solventogenesis in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . in our microarray experiments, rex was downregulated under butyrate stress. our footprinting analysis identified  <dig> operons with potential rex binding sites in their promoter regions: hyda , nirc-asra-asrb-asrc , crt-bcd-etfb-etfa , cac <dig>  cac <dig>  and adhe <dig> , the fusion-protein aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase, which is highly homologous to adhe <dig> . in addition, based on orthology to target genes in rex regulons from regprecise and identification of putative rex binding sites , the following operons were found to be putative targets for rex regulation in c. acetobutylicum as well: cac0014-sera , ldh , gapc , cac <dig>  nada-nadb-nadc , cac <dig>  cac2872-atpb-atpe-atpf-atph-atpa-atpg-atpd-atpc , adhe1-ctfa-ctfb . the expression patterns for the genes in these operons are shown in figure 6a. it is noteworthy that adhe <dig> is highly upregulated, together with adhe1-ctfa-ctfb. the latter is the set of genes responsible for butanol production in this organism  <cit> . as discussed above, these genes are also part of class iv stress response genes.

perr
perr  represses the expression of most of the genes involved in oxidative stress response, such as rbr3a-rbr3b, dfx, rd, nror, fpra <dig> and fpra <dig>  which code for reverse rubrerythrins, desulfoferrodoxin, rubredoxin, nadh-rubredoxin oxidoreductase , and oxygen-reducing flavoproteins, respectively  <cit> . perr probably acts as a peroxide sensor  <cit> . by facilitating reactive oxygen species  scavenging, perr plays an important role in the oxidative stress defense system in c. acetobutylicum, which is an obligate anaerobe. cells lacking this gene exhibit enhanced aerotolerance and increased h2o <dig> resistance. deletion of perr does not affect the intracellular level of iron but increases two-fold that of zinc  <cit> . several direct targets of perr were proposed previously by hillmann et al., through performing a genome-wide search for potential perr binding sites using virtual footprint software in combination with global transcription analysis of the perr deletion mutant against the wild type  <cit> . our microarray data for these genes are shown clustered in figure 6b. apparently, the alsaker et al.  study showed strong upregulation in these genes for the butyrate stress, but this was not the case in our new study. this may suggest that our new fermentative and culture conditions  lead to less oxidative stress and therefore these perr-regulated genes remained largely repressed or only mildly derepressed.

amino- and nucleic-acid transcriptional regulators engaged in the metabolite stress responses
argr: the arginine repressor
the arginine repressor  is known as a master regulator of arginine biosynthesis and catabolism in bacteria in response to intracellular arginine levels  <cit> . as several genes related to arginine biosynthetic process show strong bimodal expression under both butanol and butyrate stress , it is of interest to explore the potential involvement of argr. argr in c. acetobutylicum is encoded by cac <dig>  the 5th gene in the cac2078-cac <dig> operon. the argr in e.coli is known to autoregulate its own transcription  <cit> . however, it does not appear to be autoregulated in c. acetobutylicum, because the promoter region of its operon does not have an identifiable argr binding motif , based on matrix scan . three operons with genes in arginine biosynthetic activity have conserved cis-elements in their promoter regions that align well with the known argr motifs from regprecise . these operons are argg-argh , argb-argd , and argc-argj . searching for orthologs of the target genes in argr regulogs from regprecise  and scanning with the argr dna-binding motif in clostridiales, several additional operons were identified as potentially also regulated by argr. among them, argf/i , cara  and cac3620-cac <dig>  show a more similar expression pattern to those of arggh, argbd and argcj  than the other genes. interestingly, this finding suggests that cac3620-cac <dig> encode a putative arginine transport system, potentially controlling arginine uptake from the environment, as proposed previously for an arginine-responsive gene regulation  <cit> . altogether, the argr regulon in c. acetobutylicum likely includes at least  <dig> operons/genes . furthermore, our de novo motif prediction with motifator  <cit>  suggests an argr binding site upstream of cac <dig>  cac <dig> was previously annotated as a periplasmic amino acid-binding protein, but now with our prediction of argr binding site for this gene, we suspect it is an arginine-binding protein with a possible role in ar <dig> mechanism.

hisr: histidine biosynthesis regulator
as discussed, histidine biosynthesis genes are dynamically upregulated under both butanol and butyrate stress . rsat phylogenetic footprinting  <cit>  analysis shows a well conserved motif upstream of the hisz genes in organisms of the clostridia class. the c. acetobutylicum hisz gene is in an operon of  <dig> genes , including hisz, hisg, hisd, hisb, hish, hisa, hisf, hisi, hise and tkt. nine of them show a dynamic upregulation under both butanol and butyrate stress . the cis-elements in the upstream region of hisz genes in clostridia class  bear high similarity to the dna motif recognized by hisr of staphylococcaceae <cit>  . according to oma  <cit> , cac <dig> is an ortholog of hisr, which is predicted to be present in several other gram+ organisms in regprecise. based on its orthology to the corresponding target genes assigned in hisr regulogs in regprecise and identification of potential hisr-binding site in its promoter region, hisc  is also a putative target gene for hisr. to sum, the hisr regulon in c. acetobutylicum is proposed to include the hisz-tkt operon and hisc  .

cymr: cysteine metabolism repressor
in b. subtilis, cymr is a master repressor of cysteine metabolism. it controls the expression of genes involved either in cysteine synthesis from sulfide , sulfonates , or methionine  or in cysteine uptake   <cit> . the activity of cymr is positively regulated by cysk in response to cysteine availability  <cit> . when cysteine is present, the pool of o-acetylserine  is low, which leads to the formation of a cymr-cysk complex and transcriptional repression of the cymr regulon occurs. in the absence of cysteine, the oas pool is high and the cymr-cysk complex is mostly dissociated, leading to a faster dissociation of cymr from its dna targets and the lifting of cymr-dependent repression  <cit> . proteins cac <dig> and cac <dig> are the best blast hits for the b. subtilis cymr  <cit>  in c. acetobutylicum. both proteins belong to the rrf <dig> family, with winged helix-turn-helix transcription repressor dna-binding domain. regprecise database assigns cac <dig> as iron-sulfur cluster assembly transcription factor iscr. indeed, cac <dig> shows slightly higher sequence similarity to cymr than cac <dig> , whereas cac <dig> has better sequence similarity to iscr in e. coli than cac <dig> does . therefore it is possible that cac <dig> functions as cymr in c. acetobutylicum, and cac <dig> as iscr. in c. acetobutylicum, cac <dig>  immediately downstream of cac <dig>  codes for a cysteine synthase . in addition, the string network for cac <dig> further supports its involvement in regulating cysteine metabolism  <cit> . on the other hand, rsat footprinting analysis indicates that cac <dig> has a promoter element conserved in clostridia class that partially aligns well with the cymr motif from staphylococcaceae . in fact, the iscr- and cymr-binding dna motifs share quite significant sequence similarities   <cit> . furthermore, both cac <dig> and cac <dig> have identifiable cymr-binding sites when searched with the pwm built from tfbss in staphylococcaceae <cit> .

seven operons with potential cymr-binding sites in their promoter regions were identified based on orthology to the cymr target genes in bacillales and staphylococcaceae in regprecise, and with pattern matched in promoter regions using matrix scan . they include operons cac0102-cac <dig> , cysd , cysn ; protein cysc and cysn are involved in hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process) and cac0878- <dig>  . making use of the distinct expression pattern of cac0102- <dig> and cac0878- <dig>  the other cysteine-metabolism related genes/operons with similar expression pattern, i.e., cysk , operons of cac0929- <dig> and cac3325- <dig>  were further analyzed for cymr-binding sites. note that cysk and cac <dig> are putatively involved in cysteine biosynthesis from serine and in cysteine synthase activity respectively, whereas cac3325-cac <dig> encodes protein orthologous to l-cystine-binding protein tcyabc transporter in staphylococcus carnosus. indeed, cysk , cac <dig> and cac <dig> have good match to the cymr-binding motif in their promoter regions . we conclude that the cymr regulon in c. acetobutylicum likely includes at least the genes shown in figure 4c.

purr: repressor of purine metabolism
purr  is a member of purr family, which serves as repressor of purine metabolism  <cit> . cac <dig> is upregulated under butanol stress, but not so under butyrate stress, which may explain the upregulation of several purine metabolism related genes when under butyrate stress. interestingly, the majority of c. acetobutylicum genes orthologous to the purr target genes in regprecise seem to contain only half of the purr-binding dna motif in bacillales, which is a palindromic sequence comprised of two inverted repeats.

complexity of the metabolite stress response as captured by the string-based stress response network 
the high-confidence functional interactions predicted by string  were used as edges to construct the butanol/butyrate stress response network , which is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  cross-interactions are prevalent between most of the key regulons discussed above. since the majority of the transcription factors and their target genes are highly conserved in a variety of organisms of the clostridium genus , this srn is likely largely applicable to the other clostridium organisms, in addition, the complexity observed in these two core metabolite stresses may require additional layers of regulation, such as differential mrna degradation and the regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by non-coding small rnas . the role of srna under metabolite stress has been investigated for butanol and butyrate stress based on rnaseq data, and quite a few stress-responsive srnas have been identified   <cit> . several srnas were particularly up-regulated under both the metabolite stresses. they include 6s rna , tmrna , srp , solb  and sam riboswitch . identifiable or likely targets of these srnas would suggest that these and other srnas are likely involved in regulating at least some of the genes in the core regulons discussed in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
gene regulatory networks play essential roles in living organisms to respond to both external environmental and internal metabolism changes. understanding the connections and the activity levels of regulators is indispensible for the gene regulatory network research. this study produced a large set of high-resolution temporal transcriptional data. using phylogenetic footprinting analysis and orthology inference, combined with pattern-based tfbs detection, the regulatory interactions proposed from our study provide important connections between transcription factors and their target genes that are important for butanol and butyrate stress response in c. acetobutylicum. utilizing predicted transcription factor activities in combination with transcriptome data  <cit>  can be a future direction for reconstructing gene regulatory network of c. acetobutylicum. it is known that the analysis of transcriptome data does not always permit identifying the primary cause of a phenomenon observed. there are various levels of regulations apart from transcriptional ones, e.g., epigenetic regulation, translational regulations, mrna stabilities, post-translational modifications. it remains a grand challenge to integrate all these regulation layers together to reconstruct a holistic stress response network. but promising systems biology methods are in development to provide solutions to the problem.
