BACKGROUND
tryptophan is an essential amino acid for human nutrition. in kernels of cereals, e.g. maize , the tryptophan content is low, limiting the nutritional value. significant effort is made to breed maize lines with enhanced tryptophan content  <cit> . in addition to its function as protein component, plants utilize tryptophan as precursor of a large variety of secondary metabolites like terpenoid indole alkaloids, indole glucosinolates, and indolic phytoalexins . of special importance is the tryptophan-derived plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid , which is involved in numerous processes, including embryo development, apical dominance, and tropisms  <cit> . these essential functions of tryptophan emphasize the need to understand its synthesis in plants in more detail.

in bacteria, such as escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, tryptophan is synthesized from indole-3-glycerol phosphate  by a tryptophan synthase  complex  <cit> . igp is cleaved by the ts α-subunits  to indole and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate . then indole is transported via a  <dig> Å intermolecular tunnel to the tryptophan synthase β-subunits  that catalyze the condensation of indole and serine  to tryptophan . this substrate channelling ensures that indole does not escape from the enzyme complex. the reaction mechanism of this bacterial αββα complex has been studied in great detail. the α- and β-subunits interact in a highly cooperative manner and regulate each other reciprocally by allosteric interactions. in addition, alternative tsbs that are highly active, independent of interaction with the unique tsa, are expressed in some prokaryotes  <cit> . in fungi interaction of tsa and tsb is obligate as both functions are present on a single polypeptide  <cit> .

the picture is more complex in higher plants. the homologs of the bacterial tsa and tsb genes are generally duplicated, e.g. the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two putative tsa and four putative tsb genes. currently the role of these different isoforms is not fully understood. functional relevance of attsa <dig>  and attsb <dig>  was demonstrated by the facultative tryptophan auxotroph mutants trp <dig> and trp <dig>  respectively  <cit> . attsa <dig> and attsb <dig> are both localized in the plastid  <cit> . based on immunoaffinity chromatography it was strongly suggested that the two proteins form an active αβ complex  <cit> . however, it is not known whether formation of such complexes is a general phenomenon in plants.

among the cereals most information on tsa and tsb homologs is available for maize: two highly similar tsb genes  have been identified, sharing 96% identity on the mature protein level. zmtsb <dig> and zmtsb <dig> are functionally redundant active tsb enzymes. while single mutations in either gene do not affect tryptophan synthesis, the double mutant orange pericarp  is tryptophan auxotroph  <cit> . four tsa homologs are present: bx <dig>  igl, zmtsalike  <cit> , and zmtsa . bx <dig> is essential for providing indole as precursor of the natural pesticide  <dig> -dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2h- <dig> -benzoxazin-3-one   <cit> . the 3-dimensional bx <dig> structure has been determined and shown to be very similar to the active conformation of bacterial tsas  <cit> . igl transcription is triggered by insect feeding and igl provides indole as a volatile signal for parasitic wasps  <cit> . bx <dig> and igl efficiently cleave igp to form indole, while the activity of bacterial tsa subunits is dependent on the interaction with a β-subunit  <cit> . these enzymatic properties, their specific transcriptional regulation, and the lack of growth defects of bx <dig> and igl mutant plants suggested that additional tsa-homologs are involved in tryptophan biosynthesis.

in this study we aimed to identify the tsa homolog from maize that is involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. zmtsa is catalytically active and interaction of zmtsa with a β-subunit strongly enhances the catalytic efficiency of the α-reaction. a protein purification strategy was applied to obtain direct evidence that angiosperms, similarly to bacteria, form a tryptophan synthase complex.

methods

tryptophan synthase activity assays
plant protein fractions  or purified recombinant enzyme  were incubated  <dig> h for plant protein,  <dig> min for recombinant proteins, respectively, at 30°c, in  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig>  containing the following substrates: α-reaction:  <dig> μm igp  <cit> ; β-reaction:  <dig> μm indole,  <dig> mm l-serine,  <dig> μm pyridoxal phosphate; αβ-reaction:  <dig> μm igp,  <dig> mm l-serine,  <dig> μm pyridoxal phosphate, concentration ranges were analyzed for determination of kinetic parameters.

the products indole and tryptophan were quantified by hplc  using diode array  and fluorescence detection . the mobile phase was delivered with a flow rate of  <dig> ml min- <dig> with an initial mixture of 15%  meoh in  <dig> %  hcooh followed by a  <dig> min linear gradient to 100% meoh.

plant protein purification
leaf tissue  was homogenized in liquid nitrogen and extracted in  <dig> ml  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm dte,  <dig> mm pmsf, and 10% polyclar at  and centrifuged  <dig> min at  <dig>  g . the supernatant was subjected to an anion exchange column  equilibrated with  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm dte,  <dig> mm nacl at 4°c. the column was then washed with  <dig> vol of the same buffer and eluted with  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  containing  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm dte, and  <dig> m nacl in a  <dig> vol linear gradient. fractions around  <dig> mm nacl showed ts activity and were subjected  to gel permeation chromatography . the column was eluted with the same buffer .  <dig> ml fractions were collected and tested for α- and β-activity. the  <dig> to  <dig> ml fractions were precipitated by addition of 10% tca, redissolved in  <dig> μl  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm dtt, 2%  sds,  <dig> %  bromphenol blue, 10%  glycerol, and subjected to sds-page.

after fixation for >  <dig> h with a 40%  meoh/10%  hoac solution and washing in water for  <dig> ×  <dig> min the gels were stained over night with coomassie dye  coomassie brilliant blue g <dig>   <dig> %  ortho-phosphoric acid, 8%  2so <dig>  20%  meoh) and destained in 1%  hoac  <cit> . the protein bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kd were cut out and the gel piece was further destained in a thermo mixer with water ,  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig>  ph  <dig>  , and 50% acetonitrile  . the gel slice was shrunk in 100% acn, the liquid supernatant was removed and the gel dried in a speedvac for  <dig> min.

identification of tryptophan synthase protein components: sample preparation
tryptic digestion:  <dig> μl trypsin solution  were directly pipetted on the gel piece, incubated for  <dig> min on ice to allow the trypsin to move into the gel and then covered with  <dig> μl  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> followed by  <dig> h incubation at 37°c. digestion was stopped by adding  <dig> μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. peptides were extracted by consecutive basic and acid extraction. basic extraction:  <dig> μl  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> were added to the gel, shaken for  <dig> min at 37°c, and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. the same incubation followed after addition of  <dig> μl acn. both steps were repeated and the supernatants pooled. acid extraction: the gel piece was extracted twice in  <dig> μl 5%  hcooh for  <dig> min. the gel piece was shrunk twice in  <dig> μl acn. all the collected supernatants were pooled, dried in a speedvac and dissolved in  <dig> μl  <dig> mm ammonium acetate buffer, ph  <dig> , 10%  acn,  <dig> mm dtt.

a further step of digestion was performed in solution  to apply a maximum amount of hydrolyzed peptides without miscleavage. latter is important for a reproducible identification of qualifying peptides.

liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry 
an agilent micro hplc system  consisting of a quaternary capillary pump , a degasser unit , an auto sampler , and a column in a thermostat set to 40°c  was used in combination with a single time-of-flight mass spectrometer . the chromatographic separation was performed with a zorbax sb c <dig> column  by  <dig> μl sample injections. prior to injection, the trypsinized protein samples were mixed with  <dig> μl  <dig> mm nh4ac, 10% acn ,  <dig> mm dtt, ph  <dig> , sonified for  <dig> min, filtrated via hv filter, and stored in an autosampler vial. the hplc separation flow rate was  <dig> μl min- <dig>  at the beginning of each chromatographic run, the composition of the mobile phase was kept at 95%  <dig> mm nh4ac/5% acn , following a gradient to 20%  <dig> mm nh4ac/80% acn  within  <dig> min and this final value was held for  <dig> min.

ms measurements were performed in positive ionization mode with the mass spectrometer equipped by an esi source. the applied ms parameter were as follows: 350°c drying gas temperature,  <dig> lh- <dig> drying gas flow rate,  <dig> psig nebulizer gas pressure,  <dig> v capillary voltage,  <dig> v skimmer voltage and  <dig> v fragmentor voltage. the mass-range was set to  <dig> –  <dig> m/z and data acquisition was  <dig>  cycles/sec. the drying gas nitrogen was supplied by a nitrogen generator . the chemstation software  was used for system control and the analyst qs software , june, 2004) for the data acquisition.

expression of zmtsa- and zmtsalike-gfp-fusion proteins
to construct vectors for expression of gfp-fusion protein  <cit> , the stop codon of the zmtsa coding sequence was replaced by a bglii restriction site, using the following primers: 5'-cgactacaccaaatgaaagaatggag-3' , 5'-ctcgagagatctggcaatgcggccttcagg-3' . the full size zmtsa cdna fragment, in which the stop codon was eliminated, was then cut from the vector with ecori/bglii and cloned into the ecori/bamhi sites of the pezs-nl vector . the zmtsa-egfp chimera was cut with ecori, blunted, cut with xbai, and cloned into the smai/xbai sites of the pvuii-deletion of ppcve35e plant transformation vector. the same strategy was used for the construction of the zmtsalike-egfp chimeric cdna, with the primer pair: caagctggcatacatggac/ggtaccagatctggcatagcagccttcata.

transfection of maize protoplasts and confocal microscopy
maize lg <dig> seedlings were grown on an  <dig> h dark, 20°c/ <dig> h light, 26°c regime for  <dig> to  <dig> days and were then transferred to the dark for  <dig> days. protoplasts were isolated from the second true leaves essentially as described previously  <cit> . digestion was performed in 1%  cellulase r <dig>   <dig> %  macerozyme r <dig> ,  <dig>  m mannitol,  <dig> mm mes, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm cacl <dig> for  <dig> h at 28°c on a rotating shaker . after filtration through a 65-μm nylon mesh, the protoplasts were collected by  <dig> min centrifugation at  <dig> g, followed by centrifugation at  <dig> g in floating solution ,  <dig> mm mes,  <dig> mm kcl). floating protoplasts were washed in  <dig>  m mannitol,  <dig> mm mes,  <dig> mm kcl and counted. electroporation was performed with  <dig>  ×  <dig> protoplasts and  <dig> μg of each plasmid in  <dig> μl  <dig> mm mes-koh, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m mannitol,  <dig> mm kcl. transformed protoplasts were incubated in the dark at 25°c for  <dig> h in  <dig> mm mes-koh, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m mannitol,  <dig> mm kcl.

confocal microscope images were taken using an olympus fv <dig> confocal laser microscope with a 40× water objective. the excitation wavelength for egfp detection was  <dig> nm.

RESULTS
isolation of zmtsa
in maize, four genes encoding tsa homologs are present. bx <dig>  igl, and zmtsalike have been described previously  <cit> . a search of the genebank and maize genomic database  revealed putative tsa sequences, which do not constitute alleles of bx <dig>  igl, or zmtsalike. these sequences, partly represented by the tentative unique gene  zmtuc03-08- <dig> , correspond to a new gene, now designated zmtsa. zmtsa is located on chromosome  <dig> . a full-length zmtsa cdna clone was isolated . most plant tsas have divergent n-terminal sequences that have no counterpart in bacteria and represent transit peptides for plastid import. when this variable part is excluded from the analysis, zmtsa is 63% identical to bx <dig>  67% to igl, and 72% to zmtsalike on protein level, respectively .

expression and subcellular localization
for a further characterization of the closely related genes zmtsa and zmtsalike their transcription levels were determined by rt-pcr in different tissues and developmental stages. zmtsa and zmtsalike transcripts were detected in all  <dig> tissues analyzed  and generally, zmtsa was the predominant isoform expressed. the average transcript levels relative to gapdh in these preparations were determined as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fg fg- <dig> for zmtsa and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fg fg- <dig> for zmtsalike. the virtually homogeneous expression of zmtsa and zmtsalike qualifies them as candidates to function in tryptophan biosynthesis in maize. in contrast, bx <dig> is predominantly transcribed in seedlings and igl is specifically induced in response to herbivore attack  <cit> .

there is a number of data suggesting that plant tryptophan biosynthesis is predominantly localized in the plastids  <cit> . zmtsa and zmtsalike were analyzed in silico for putative targeting sequences using "targetp" and "ipsort"  <cit> . zmtsa was predicted to be plastid localized, while zmtsalike,  <dig> amino acids shorter at the n-terminus, was expected to be retained in the cytoplasm.

to obtain experimental evidence, plasmids conferring expression of zmtsa- and zmtsalike-gfp fusion proteins were transformed into maize protoplasts. gfp and chlorophyll autofluorescence were analyzed by confocal microscopy . in case of zmtsa gfp fluorescence coincided with the chlorophyll autofluorescence of the chloroplasts , demonstrating plastidic localization of zmtsa. in contrast, zmtsalike-gfp was localized in the cytosol .

zmtsa has tryptophan synthase α activity
we determined the kinetic parameters for the ts α-reaction for the two candidates. purified recombinant zmtsa was tested for conversion of igp to indole. a low, but clearly detectable igp turnover  was observed . no α-activity of recombinant zmtsalike was detected in analogous experiments.

2)  <cit> , st: s. typhimurium.

n. d.: for zmtsalike no igp turnover was detected.

formation of a tryptophan synthase complex in vitro
in bacteria α activity of the ts complex is two orders of magnitude higher than that of tsa alone. therefore, zmtsa was allowed to interact with purified recombinant zmtsb <dig> for  <dig> h at 4°c adding  <dig> mm serine and  <dig> μm pyridoxal phosphate. to investigate complex formation with zmtsb1in vitro, the zmtsa/zmtsb <dig> mixture was subjected to size exclusion chromatography . zmtsa and zmtsb <dig> formed a complex of approximately  <dig> kd  that according to sds-page analysis  contained both proteins in a 1: <dig> stoichiometry. these results are consistent with formation of a zmtsa2zmtsb <dig> heterotetramer. the kinetic parameters of zmtsa, zmtsb <dig>  and zmtsa/zmtsb <dig> heteromers were determined . heteromerisation with zmtsb <dig> resulted in a 32-fold increase of the catalytic efficiency of zmtsa.

no interaction of zmtsb <dig> with zmtsalike, bx <dig>  or igl was detectable. the native molecular masses of zmtsalike, bx <dig>  and igl were estimated by gel filtration to around  <dig> kd, indicating that these proteins were monomers in solution . zmtsb <dig> apparently formed dimers of approximately  <dig> kd . no prominent larger complexes were observed. zmtsalike remained inactive with igp as substrate also when the β-subunit was added to the preparation . the experiment was repeated with thrombin digested proteins to exclude lack of complexation due to sterical hindrance caused by the his-tag yielding identical results .

tryptophan synthase activity in leaf protein extracts
to investigate, whether α2β <dig> ts complexes are also formed in vivo, protein extracts of b <dig> wildtype maize and the mutant lines bx <dig>  zmtsb <dig>  and zmtsb <dig> were separated by size exclusion chromatography. individual fractions were tested for conversion of igp to indole + glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate  and of indole + serine to tryptophan  . in a fraction representing proteins of approx.  <dig> kd both α- and β-activity was detected . this fraction was as well capable of the total  ts reaction in all genotypes tested . β-activity was also clearly detected in the fraction of approx.  <dig> kd proteins, the size of putative β-dimers. the zmtsb <dig> zmtsb <dig>  double mutant is devoid of β-activity and shows severe growth defects  <cit> . here, the respective single mutants zmtsb <dig>  and zmtsb <dig>  were tested and each yielded β-activity in both the  <dig> kd and the  <dig> kd complex fractions . this indicates that zmtsb <dig> and zmtsb <dig> are functionally redundant and may both form active β-dimers as well as active αββα ts complexes. in extracts from b <dig> wildtype, as well as zmtsb <dig> or zmtsb <dig> mutants a second α-activity peak was determined in a fraction of approximately  <dig> kd, corresponding to the monomer size of tsa homologs. in extracts of bx <dig> mutants this activity was not present, indicating that monomeric α-activity in leaves is predominantly due to activity of bx <dig> enzyme.

zmtsa is a component of the tryptophan synthase complex in maize
to identify constituents of the  <dig> kd ts complex in planta a mass-spectrometry-based approach was applied. sequence qualifying peptides, i.e. peptides allowing annotation, were obtained for zmtsa, zmtsalike, bx <dig>  igl, and zmtsb <dig> by the analysis of tryptic digests of recombinant proteins using liquid chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled by electrospray ionisation . the resulting detection signals of peptides were compared with theoretically expected tryptic peptide masses .  <dig> % of the total sequence was covered for zmtsa,  <dig> % for zmtsalike,  <dig> % for zmtsb <dig>   <dig> % for bx <dig>  and  <dig> % for igl.

to identify the active α-subunit of the ts complex in maize, ts activity was partially purified from leaf extracts by subsequent ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. the  <dig> kd protein fraction was concentrated and separated by sds-page. proteins between approx.  <dig> kd  and  <dig> kd  were cut out of the gel. a tryptic digest of these proteins was analyzed by lc-esi-tof-ms and surveyed for peptides sequence qualifying for zmtsa, zmtsalike, bx <dig>  igl, and zmtsb <dig> 

four peptides characteristic for zmtsa were present as major peptide signals in this tryptic digest of the  <dig> kd fraction containing active ts . the probability for a specific random dodeca-peptide, such as e.g. identified gttfedvismvk is in the order of approximately 10- <dig>  therefore, zmtsa was conclusively identified as component of a maize ts complex. no peptides specific for zmtsalike, bx <dig>  or igl were detected . the peptides adgtgpliylk and datseair were identified, which could be assigned to either of the highly similar active zmtsb isoforms. for zmtsb <dig> the specific peptide qalnvfr was identified. no zmtsb <dig> specific peptide was clearly assigned. however, based on zmtsb <dig> mutant analysis  it is very likely that also zmtsb <dig> is present in ts complexes in vivo. in summary, zmtsa and zmtsb <dig> were identified by lc-esi-tof-msas constituents of ts complexes.

discussion
evidence for physical interaction of tryptophan synthase α and β subunits in plants was provided by immunoaffinity chromatography for arabidopsis  <cit>  and by size exclusion chromatography for maize . for the identification of the maize tryptophan synthase components in vivo, specific sequence qualifying peptides were assigned by lc-ms. this approach allows the analysis of enzyme complexes that are not sufficiently stable for application of a larger variety of chromatographic separations, necessary for purification to homogeneity. applying this method, zmtsa was identified as α-subunit of a tryptophan synthase complex.

the apparent molecular weight strongly indicates that in maize tryptophan synthase is functional as αββα heterotetramer, similar as in bacteria  <cit> . in maize zmtsa is the principal α-subunit of the complex. catalytic efficiency of zmtsa was enhanced more than 30-fold by interaction with the β-subunit . such activating interaction between α- and β-subunit is also well known from bacteria like e. coli . in e. coli this activation was mutual, i.e. β-activity strongly increased upon formation of an α2β <dig> ts complex  <cit> . in contrast, no significant activation of the maize β-subunit by zmtsa was observed . the reason for this difference between the bacterial and plant enzyme is not known.

in maize, ancestral tsas have been recruited for secondary metabolism. the tsa homologs bx <dig> and igl catalyze the formation of indole, which functions as dimboa precursor or volatile signal  <cit>   and bx <dig> monomer activity was observed in leaf extracts . in addition, tsb dimers that have been observed in leaf extracts  and in vitro , which possibly function in salvage of indole by its conversion to tryptophan. it remains open, whether a mechanism involving bx <dig> monomer and tsb dimer contributes significantly to the total metabolic flux towards tryptophan. the bx <dig> mutant and the bx <dig> igl double mutant  are fully viable; therefore this process is not essential at any stage of development.

we propose that, despite the availability of the highly active monomers bx <dig> and igl, in maize tryptophan is predominantly synthesized through a tryptophan synthase complex containing zmtsa and zmtsb <dig> or zmtsb <dig>  respectively. probably this complex has been retained during evolution for tryptophan synthesis, as it enables substrate channelling and allosteric regulation. knockout mutants could serve as ultimate proof for zmtsa being essential. therefore we have extensively screened public databases as well as the large pioneer hibred tusc collection for mu-transposon insertion mutants  <cit>  in zmtsa. however, no insertion alleles were identified. it remains open, whether zmtsa knockout mutants are lethal.

based on import studies, subcellular fractionation, and target sequence prediction, it is suggested that in plants the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids is predominantly localized in plastids . consistent with these data zmtsa contains a chloroplast targeting sequence and zmtsa::gfp fusion proteins were targeted to the plastid . interestingly, the tsa homolog zmtsalike lacks such a transit peptide and zmtsalike::gfp fusion proteins were located in the cytosol . it has been debated whether the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids is also partially active in the cytoplasm, as e.g. a cytoplasmic isoform of chorismate mutase is expressed in arabidopsis  <cit> . as recombinant zmtsalike, expressed in e. coli, did not show any α-activity it remains unclear, whether zmtsalike functions as cytosolic tsa isoform. zmtsalike might either require specific conditions and modifications or it has an unknown function in plant metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
four tsa homologs exist in maize. only one of these isoforms, zmtsa, is involved in the formation of a tryptophan synthase complex. based on our data and previous results for arabidopsis thaliana we propose that a ubiquitous tryptophan synthase complex is responsible for tryptophan formation in angiosperms, like in fungi and bacteria.
