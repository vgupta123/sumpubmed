BACKGROUND
peach  is a fruit tree species with a relatively simple genome: diploid , small  and without any recent duplications  <cit> . these characteristics, together with a relatively short juvenile period  and a self-compatible mating system, make peach one of the model species for the rosaceae  <cit> . from the economic standpoint, peach production exceeds twenty million tons of fruit per year, being in the top ten of the most produced fruits worldwide . consequently, the improvement of some of its key traits, such as those related with its production season, and pre and postharvest fruit quality, can have a major impact for the fruit industry.

self-compatibility, selection during domestication and migration of peaches from their center of origin in china to western europe, and bottlenecks occurring during modern breeding, have resulted in a very narrow level of genetic variability available to breeders  <cit> . this limits the progress of breeding and makes it difficult to overcome some of the main challenges for the improvement of p. persica. although most breeding programs still depend on very limited variability, some breeding initiatives have started to use genetically distant landraces or even related prunus species in order to introgress specific characteristics into the current commercial materials, such as disease resistance, climate adaptation and fruit quality .

peach consumer acceptance mostly depends on fruit quality traits such as flavor, color and size, while growers and retailers are more interested in characters such as productivity, disease resistance, a wide choice of harvest periods and post-harvest behavior  <cit> . the improvement of these traits could be enhanced by the use of molecular markers, but even though many marker-trait associations have been reported  <cit> , their use in peach breeding programs to select major genes and quantitative trait loci  is only in the early stages  <cit> . one of the main reasons is the lack of concise information on the number and position of the genes determining the inheritance of a given trait, as its detection is very often based on the analysis of a single progeny with a limited number of offspring . this results in the identification of only some of the qtls, and alleles at these qtls, affecting the trait or in an overestimation of the effects of the qtls identified  <cit> . in addition, the qtls are usually not validated in different genetic backgrounds, making it difficult to extrapolate their magnitude and robustness to different breeding programs.

qtl mapping based on the joint analysis of multiple progenies can strongly alleviate some of the drawbacks of single-progeny genetic analyses. we used a bayesian qtl mapping method, implemented in the flexqtl software, as recently used in apple , peach and related species  <cit> , cherry  <cit>  and strawberry  <cit> . these authors focused on specific characters such as firmness, sweetness-related, bud-break and flowering time in apple, fruit size in sweet cherry and disease resistance in strawberry, or on several fruit quality and productivity characters in peach. these peach studies included a relatively small number of individuals either from crosses with almond and other prunus species  <cit>  or seedlings exclusively from commercial breeding programs  <cit> . in this paper we analyzed a large collection  from  <dig> peach progenies,  <dig> full-sib and one half-sib families, of different european research institutions for seven relevant traits of quantitative inheritance: flowering date , maturity date , fruit development period , percentage of red skin overcolor , titratable acidity , soluble solid content  and weight of the whole fruit . fd, md and fdp are priority traits for extending the peach production season and to adapt peaches to a changing climate, whereas psc, ta, ssc and fw are among the most relevant traits for consumer acceptance. the set of parents used to generate these populations included a combination of elite commercial materials, landraces and peach-related species , allowing us to explore a large fraction of the genetic variability of the expanded p. persica gene pool. our results hold promise for the identification of valuable new genes to produce a new wave of more interesting varieties for growers, retailers and consumers.

methods
plant material
the plant material used consisted of  <dig> individuals from  <dig> progenies of five european breeding programs. these were located in inra-avignon , inra-bordeaux , irta-lleida , mas.pes program  and crea-rome , with no duplicated individuals or common cultivars between orchards. among them, ten were f <dig>  five f <dig>  two bc <dig> and one bc <dig>  all of them are full-sib progenies with the exception of bc <dig> that is a half-sib progeny  <cit> . progeny sizes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . thirteen of the progenies were derived from intra-specific crosses between peach varieties, while the other five were obtained by interspecific crosses between peach and related species, i.e., almond  and the wild, but closely related prunus davidiana. the peach parents included commercial cultivars but also non-commercial accessions, as is the case of ferganensis peach, the ornamental ‘weeping flower’, the rootstocks ‘rubira®’ and ‘pamirskij 5’ and the cultivar ‘bolinha’. the  <dig> progenies involving any of these cultivars and/or the related prunus species were denominated ‘non-commercial’  progenies .table  <dig> description of the  <dig> progenies included in the analysis


athose progenies derived exclusively from commercial parents were classified as commercial progenies  in contrast with the rest classified as non-commercial  progenies


bphenotypes measured for each progeny: beginning of flowering time , beginning of ripening time , fruit development period , percentage of red overcolor on the fruit skin , titratable acidity of the fruit flesh , soluble solid content of the fruit flesh  and weight of the whole fruit . the number of years for which each trait was evaluated is indicated in parentheses




phenotypic data
phenotypic data for agronomic traits measured over several years were available at each location. we gathered existing data for seven of these quantitative traits: onset of flowering time , onset of ripening time , fruit development period , percentage of red overcolor on the fruit skin , titratable acidity of the fruit flesh , soluble solid content of fruit flesh  and fruit weight measured as the average of  <dig> random peaches sampled from each tree . the traits and number of years of observations varied per progeny . when available, observations for two or more years were compared and analyzed for consistency; those ranking the individuals in ordinal positions differing by more than 50% between years were removed. following, outlying observations within progenies and years were identified and removed as described by  <cit> . subsequently, the year with more observations per trait and progeny was selected for the analysis. a correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the representativeness of the selected data. in general correlations were moderate  . data for most of the traits followed a normal distribution , with moderate skewness , with only two of them  deviating from normality with positive skew.

to evaluate the environment effect introduced in the analysis by combining data from different locations, we also conducted the analysis after standardizing the raw observations following two statistical methods. in both cases the skewness of all distributions was reduced. standardizations consisted of: i) normalizing data from the same location and year to a range between  <dig> and  <dig>  and ii) standardizing data from the same location and year to a variable range, with mean equal to  <dig> and standard deviation equal to  <dig> . std1=xi−xminxmax−xmin;std2=xi−x¯sσx,s 


where xi is the i-th data, xmin, xmax and x¯s are the minimum, the maximum and the average of the sample data for a specific trait and σx,s is the sample standard deviation.

dna extraction and genotyping
genomic dna of parents and seedlings was extracted from young leaves using the qiagen dneasy  <dig> or mini plant kit® , according to the protocol provided by the supplier dna quantification was performed for each sample using quant-it™ picogreen® reagent  and genotyped with the 9 k international peach snp consortium array, containing  <dig> snps scattered over the eight peach chromosomes  <cit> . snps were ordered according to their coordinates on the second version of the peach genome v <dig>  . genetic positions were estimated by dividing the coordinates of the peach genome by the genetic length of each chromosome using the published txe map as reference  <cit> , which resulted in a genome-wide mean of  <dig>  kbp/cm.

the raw genotypes obtained from genomestudio® software were filtered using a pre-release of assist  <cit> . monomorphic snps in all progenies or with null alleles were discarded . the snps that passed the filters were grouped in haploblocks  of 1 cm, and haplotyped with pedihaplotyper  <cit>  to reduce the computation time of the analysis and to facilitate visual inspection of markers across pedigrees.

qtl mapping methodology
flexqtltm software was used for the qtl analysis  <cit>  . flexqtltm uses bi-allelic qtls model that allow three different genotypes , and a continuous uniform distribution to assign prior qtl positions along the genome and a 2 cm binning of the genome. in this study we considered only additive effects with normal prior distribution. the models analyzed were set with a prior mean number of  <dig> qtls and maximum of  <dig> qtls, with the exception of the fd trait, where the mean and maximum number of prior qtls was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

additionally, “year and location” and “maturity date” were included in the model as nuisance variables, considered to follow either uniform  or normal  distribution.

flexqtltm was run with simulation length of  <dig> , <dig> iterations, allowed to stop once convergence was reached after a minimum of  <dig>  iterations, with a simulation chain length of at least  <dig> effective chain samples for the overall mean, the residual variance, the number of qtls and the variance of such number  <cit> . to reduce auto-correlation among samples, only one every  <dig> iterations was stored for further posterior inferences.

qtl evidence was estimated as in  <cit>  using twice the natural log of the bayes factors  obtained after pair-wise comparison of models differing in one qtl: 2lnbf values between two and five indicated positive evidence, between five and ten strong, and above ten decisive. posterior qtl intensities were used to define their position on the linkage groups, as in  <cit> , and their contributions to the observed phenotypes were obtained from the mean estimates of the qtl effect sizes. genome-wide bin-wise breeding values  were predicted by using posterior probabilities of qtl genotypes, intensities and effect sizes while taking into account all the genome binds and considering only additive effects. all estimations and predictions were carried out using the flexqtltm software as technically explained in . correlation between the qtl-based genomic breeding values and the observed phenotypes in all the plant materials was used to calculate the accuracy.

all analyses were repeated at least twice  in order to verify consistency of the results.

RESULTS
snp genotypes
individuals were genotyped with the 9 k international peach snp consortium array  <cit> . after filtering for quality, the total number of informative snps across all progenies was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> . the average number of informative snps per progeny was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . polymorphic snps mapped unevenly within and across chromosomes, revealing large homozygous regions. for example no snp segregated in chromosome eight of the jxf progeny. similarly, none of the snps of chromosomes two, four, five, seven or eight segregated in boxbo. closely linked snps were grouped in  <dig> haploblocks with an average position of one every  <dig>  kb. this strategy converted bi-allelic snps into multi-allelic hb-markers, decreasing computation time and memory requirements.

qtl detection: number, position and additive effects, genotype probabilities, breeding values and description accuracy
flexqtltm software was used to detect qtls for each of the seven traits by conducting an integrated analysis of phenotypic and genetic data of all progenies. the number of individuals analyzed per trait varied between  <dig> for red skin coloration  to more than  <dig> for the qtls responsible for fd and md. analyses were performed with original and both standardized observations . the estimated narrow-sense heritability of the traits  was lower with the original data than after standardization which brought h <dig> up to  <dig>  for ssc to  <dig>  for md, with an average of  <dig> . all putative qtls detected with at least positive evidence  with the original data and in one or both standardizations; or those with decisive evidence  in one of the three data sets were considered for further examination and discussion . overall the analysis identified  <dig> qtls meeting this requirement . most of the qtls  had high evidence:  <dig> were decisive  and  <dig> strong . confidence intervals ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, with an average of  <dig>  mb. thanks to the qtl genotypes estimated by flexqtl per parental line , the progenies contributing to each of the detected qtl could be identified. for  <dig> qtls, the genotype for each parent was assigned as qq, qq or qq , while for ten qtls  no genotypes could be assigned for more than 25% of the parents. figure  <dig> also shows the estimated genome-wide, bin-wise breeding values  of the parents, indicating their contribution in decreasing  or increasing  phenotypic values among their progenies. most of the parents had a genetic potential in advancing flowering but not in anticipating maturity date. similarly, all showed a certain capacity for increasing ta levels.fig.  <dig> posterior qtl models obtained with the combined original data of all progenies. horizontal axes represent the eight chromosomes of the peach genome; green ticks indicate the snp haplotype position and chromosomes are delimited by dotted vertical lines. red and gray dashed horizontal lines indicate the bin-wise prior and posterior probability thresholds, respectively. the filled gray areas on the qtl peaks correspond to those bin regions exceeding the posterior bin-wise threshold probabilities. green, yellow and white squares indicate the intensity of evidence  of the corresponding qtl

the stability of fruit quality qtls was checked by adding two nuisance variables to the flexqtl analysis: the orchard location and evaluation year  and the maturity date . when adding nui <dig> in the analysis, all but one of the three qtls for the psc trait in chromosome  <dig>  were detected . similarly, all fruit trait qtls except qpsc <dig> and qta <dig>  were detected when including the nui <dig> in the analysis. in all cases, the missing qtls had previously shown low evidence  as well as low additive effect.

seven of the families analyzed derived from crosses between commercial or improved varieties, while the remaining derived from non-commercial or non-persica parents. to enhance detection of the qtls putatively more representative in commercial germplasm, we performed the analysis using only the progenies of the commercial parents. in total we detected  <dig> qtls, all already detected when analyzing together all progenies. among them, five were for fw, four for fd, md, fdp and ssc, three for psc and one for ta .

accuracy was estimated through the correlations between the progeny phenotypes and their estimated qtl-based gbv obtained with original data as well as with standardized measures .table  <dig> accuracies with original  and standardized data

when considering all progenies and original data, the highest accuracy was obtained for fd , followed by fdp , md, ta and fw , and psc  and ssc . accuracy for ssc prediction was also the lowest for the two standardization methods . as shown, the correlation between gbv and the observed phenotypes varies for each trait and also progeny; on average, accuracies were higher for commercial progenies than those designed for experimental genetic studies.

a more detailed description of the results shown in table  <dig>  for each trait, is given in the following paragraphs.

flowering date 
the narrow-sense heritability  estimated by flexqtl with original data was  <dig> . nine putative qtls were identified on six chromosomes: in g <dig> , g <dig> , g <dig> , g <dig> , g <dig>  and g <dig> , with additive effects ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  days. the average interval size for fd qtls was  <dig>  mb. the qfd <dig>  and qfd <dig>  qtls were decisive while that for qfd <dig>  and qfd <dig>  were detected with strong evidence. the families contributing to the decisive qtl qfd <dig>  were pxf , rsx <dig> , and btxnr . the only progeny that contributed to the other decisive qtl  was wfxp, arosed from the selfing of a qq heterozygous hybrid. these two qtls, the strong qtl on chromosome  <dig> , and the positive qfd <dig> and qfd <dig>  were lost when analyzing only the commercial families, with only four of the qtls remaining . genome-wide breeding values for each parent are shown in fig.  <dig>  all but two parents showed potential in advancing flowering date between  <dig>  and  <dig>  days. only the hybrid ‘weeping flower peach’ x ‘pamirskij 5’  and the parent ‘rome star’ delayed flowering . accuracy of the predictions was in general high  with the exception of that for pxr, btxak and t1e. the accuracy only increased for pxr after data standardization . gbvs for the boxbo progeny correlated 100% with the observed phenotypes.

maturity date 
the maturity date  h <dig> estimated with original data was  <dig> . in total, seven putative qtls were detected for md on six chromosomes: in g <dig> , g <dig> , g <dig> , g <dig> , g <dig>  and g <dig> , with additive effects ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  days . the average interval size for md qtls was  <dig>  mb, ranging from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. three qtls  were detected with decisive evidence  while those for qmd <dig>  qmd <dig> and qmd <dig>  had strong evidence. two of the qtls for which evidence was decisive  also had a large effect ; for both, the confidence interval spanned close to 3 mb. the four progenies contributing to the decisive qtl in chromosome  <dig> were all non-commercial . in contrast, the qtl qmd <dig>  also decisive, was discovered in commercial families. after removing non-commercial progenies from the analysis, qtls on g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> disappeared and only those on g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> remained. the ‘earlygold’ and ‘armking’ varieties had the highest capacity for accelerating maturity  while ‘nectalady’ had the greatest genetic ability for delaying maturity . the accuracy of predictions was  <dig>  when considering all progenies original phenotypic observations. it was poor for rxd and wfxp families  while mxr <dig>  t1e and txe were the most accurate . in general accuracies improved with both standardizations, especially with std <dig> 

fruit development period 
the fruit development period was obtained by subtracting the flowering date from the maturity date. for this trait, flexqtl estimated h2 =  <dig> . the qtls identified coincided with those for md with one additional qtl in g <dig>  with strong evidence  and high effect . as for md, evidence for qfdp <dig> and qfdp <dig>  were decisive and had high effect on the phenotype . on average, the intervals for the eight qtls were narrower than those established for md and fd, ranging from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb and an average of  <dig>  mb. as for md, the decisive qtl qfdp <dig> was generated by progenies containing ‘pamirskij 5’ and ferganensis, and disappeared when removing non-commercial progenies from the analysis. ‘belbinette’ and ‘bc <dig> ’ had higher positive gbv , while the highest ability in shortening fruit development period was assigned to ‘earlygold’ . the overall gbv of progenies correlated well with observations. when considering all progenies, data correlations were  <dig> . the progeny for which prediction accuracy was lowest was rsx <dig> .

percentage of skin overcolor 
for psc, flexqtl estimated h2 =  <dig>  and identified five putative qtls on three chromosomes, one in g <dig> , one in g <dig>  and three in g <dig> . none was identified with decisive evidence. there was strong evidence for qpsc <dig> and qpsc <dig> and positive for the three remaining . additive effects ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of red skin overcolor . qtl intervals covered an average of  <dig>  mb; the qtl qpsc <dig>  was the one detected with the narrowest interval , while the other strong qtl  covered a much larger region . the strong qtl in chromosome  <dig> was identified in the progeny jxf, while wfxp and pxf segregated for qpsc <dig>  where the non-commercial line ‘pamirskij 5’ provided the rare allele for low psc. the qq x qq bxo progeny contributed to qpsc <dig>  ferganensis, p. davidiana or ‘zephyr’ contributed negatively to the psc trait, while the f <dig> hybrid of ‘ferjalou jalousia’ x ‘fantasia’  contributed most to red skin coverage. in general, commercial parents contributed positively to increase the percentage of skin overcolor  while non-bred parents contributed to reducing skin overcolor . the correlation between gbv and the percentage of skin red overcolor observed was lower than that of the previous traits . as for fdp, the prediction for rsx <dig> was low  for the original data but improved after data standardization .

titratable acidity 
narrow-sense heritability for ta was  <dig> . five putative qtls were identified on four chromosomes, one in g <dig>  one in g <dig>  one in g <dig>  and two in g <dig> . two had decisive evidence  and high additive effect , spanning a region of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, respectively. the average confidence interval of all the qtls was  <dig>  mb. when considering only the parents with assigned genotype at qta <dig>  the progenies that led to the discovery of this qtl were wfxp and pxr. the families contributing to the qtl on chromosome  <dig> were mxr <dig>  bbxnl, jxf, btxa and btxnr, whereas the low acid allele came from parents rebus  <dig>  ‘nectalady’, ‘big top’ and the hybrid from ‘ferjalou jalousia’ and ‘fantasia’ . all parents were potentially able to increase acidity. the parents with lower gbv were the sub-acid varieties ‘rebus 028’ and ‘zephyr’ , while those increasing the acidity more were ‘oro a’ and ‘rome star’ .

to minimize a possible epistatic effect of the maturity date on ta content we included md data as a nuisance variable in the genetic model. all qtls except qta <dig>   were maintained. the correlation between gbv and ta was high . the model was able to better predict the breeding value for the bbxnl , mxr <dig> and jxf  progenies. predictions were worst for pxf, although, as previously, they increased after standardizations.

soluble solids content 
narrow-sense heritability for ssc was  <dig> . for this trait we identified six putative qtls on four chromosomes: on g <dig> , g <dig> , g <dig>  and g <dig> . qtls were detected with either strong  or positive evidence . the additive effect of qtls ranged from  <dig>  °brix to  <dig>  °brix and covered a region of  <dig>  mb. the model failed to assign the most probable genotype to more than 25% of the parents in qssc <dig>  qssc <dig> , qssc <dig>  and qssc <dig> . the families contributing to qssc <dig>  were those containing ‘big top’ and ‘belbinette’. the latter variety also contributed to the strong qtls qssc <dig>  and qssc <dig> . all qtls were maintained after including md data as a nuisance variable, while the positive ones disappeared in the analysis including only the commercial crosses. breeding values were positive  for most of the non-commercial parents and negative, although close to zero, for the commercial ones. these values showed a correlation of  <dig>  with the measures obtained and, at progeny level, were similar when analyzing raw and standardized data. the average accuracy per population was  <dig> , ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with an average value of  <dig> .

fruit weight 
narrow-sense heritability for fruit weight was  <dig> . seven qtls were detected on four chromosomes: one in g <dig> and in g <dig>  three in g <dig>  and two in g <dig> . qtl evidence was decisive for the one at the top of g <dig>  with additive effect of  <dig>  g covering a region of  <dig>  mb. strong evidence was assigned to qfw <dig> , qfw <dig>  and qfw <dig> , with additive effects equal to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  g, respectively.

all qtls were maintained after including md as a nuisance variable in the model. the analysis with exclusively commercial progenies detected all but qfw <dig> and qfw <dig> , both with positive evidence only on analysing the full germplasm. the first was based on the segregation in the f <dig> individual from the cross ‘if7310828’ x ferganensis , and the parents ‘rebus 028’ and bc <dig> , with overall breeding values of − <dig> , − <dig>  and  <dig>  g, respectively. belbinette contributed to the second  . the parents with higher gbv were ‘nectaross’ and ‘belbinette’ . correlations between gbv and weights were high,  <dig> , when analyzing all progenies, and lower for txe and t1e .

discussion
in this study, we present the results of the integrated analysis of  <dig> families from different european breeding programs, with the discovery and characterization of qtls involved in seven of the most important agronomical traits in peach. a novel strategy for qtl analysis was applied: we integrated genotype data from different progenies, as well as phenotype data obtained in different orchards and years and, therefore, under different environmental conditions. the data was statistically standardized and nuisance variables were introduced to minimize the environmental effect while evaluating the stability of the qtls. this strategy contrasts with previous methodologies using single year and single location phenotypic data or where multi-year and multi-site data were integrated through the use of common reference cultivars  <cit>  to identify qtls, and is in line with the use of nuisance variables to account for genetic structure in cases where the genetic links between families cannot be monitored through genotyped pedigrees  <cit> . our strategy allowed a considerable increase in the sample size for the qtl analysis compared to previous studies on single families. another new feature was to transform the bi-allelic snp markers into multi-allelic markers by constructing snp-haploblocks and their related haplotypes.

heritability & accuracy
flexqtl integrated analysis generated models with high estimated narrow sense heritabilities . the h <dig> values for md , fdp  and psc  were within the range of those found before by other authors using classical heritability analyses:  <dig> – <dig>  for md,  <dig>  for fdp and  <dig>  for psc . for the other four characters, fd , ta , ssc  and fw , these values were close to the upper boundary of those available:  <dig> – <dig>  for fd,  <dig> – <dig>  for ta,  <dig> – <dig>  for ssc and  <dig> – <dig>  for fw  <cit> . although the highest values for ta  and ssc  are estimates of broad sense heritability   <cit> , these data are consistent with intermediate to high heritability of the characters analyzed. our observations are in agreement with the broad sense heritabilities calculated by  <cit>  in peach materials introgressed with almond and other related prunus for six of these characters . h <dig> values were similar to those for h <dig> that we calculated for fd, md and fw, and slightly lower for fdp, ta and ssc. our higher heritability estimates may be due to the different sets of populations used , the larger sample examined , or both.

even though the models we used only took into account the additive effects, the accuracy between explained and observed phenotypes was very high: from the highest  <dig>  pearson’s correlation for fd to the lowest  <dig>  for ssc . as expected, traits showing higher heritability  were also those with higher correlations between predicted and observed phenotypes . in fact, as previously mentioned, the accuracy of our models was usually lower for non-commercial progenies than for those generated from crosses with only commercial peach varieties . this may be explained by the fact that fewer alleles are present in commercial varieties, and at higher frequency, so their effects are better estimated by the models we used compared to those of exotic materials, which often segregate in one or a few progenies.

although in general accuracies were slightly higher for raw data, for some families and traits, standardizations improved accuracies up to 178% for std <dig>  and up to 241% for std <dig> . in all cases these families had a reduced sample size or only one year of available observations, which prevented for quality data filtering.

origin of novel variability
of the  <dig> putative qtls obtained,  <dig>  would not have been found when analyzing the subset of seven commercial progenies , nine with positive, eight with strong and five with decisive evidence. for  <dig> of these , qfd <dig> , qmd <dig>  qfdp <dig>  qpsc <dig> , qpsc <dig> , qssc <dig> and qta <dig>  the parents carrying variant alleles were all exotic lines or hybrids between commercial and exotic genotypes , suggesting that this is a fraction of variability essentially from outside the peach commercial gene pool. on the other hand, no qtl detected with the whole set of progenies was detected exclusively when using only the set of commercial progenies . this highlights the importance of incorporating novel variability into the peach commercial gene pool or, more specifically, increasing effective population size in the set of progenies considered. these results exemplify also that the model used was more efficient in detecting qtls when using a larger number of populations as four of the qtls detected with the  <dig> populations  were not detected when using only the subset of the commercial peach populations, although they were expected to segregate in some of them as it can be deduced from the estimated genotypes of their parents in fig.  <dig> 

co-localization with previously described major genes and qtls and pleiotropic effects
some of the qtls detected coincided with the position of major genes already reported. this is the case of qmd <dig> with decisive evidence, mapping to the same region in the central part of g <dig> as the md gene determining maturity date  <cit> . a major qtl in this region has been identified in other peach progenies as well as in crosses involving other prunus crops  <cit> .

another major gene, d, responsible for the acid vs. subacid fruit taste in peach and located at the proximal end of g <dig>  <cit>  co-maps with a decisive qtl for ta . the dominant allele conferring the subacid character is present in some of the commercial parents studied, e.g. ‘big top’, ‘nectalady’, ‘rebus 028’ and ‘ferjalou jalousia®’  . this indicates that this locus may be the responsible for the low-acid boundary while the remaining qtls may contribute to the variation on the acidity levels.

qfw <dig> , a qtl with strong evidence for fruit weight, maps to the end of g <dig>  where the s gene that determines the flat vs. round shape of the fruit is located  <cit> . this qtl is heterozygous only in the jxf progeny , consistent with the fact that only this progeny segregates for the fruit shape phenotype, and that flat peaches are usually lighter than the round ones.

qtl-discovery data were previously published for eight of the  <dig> families currently analyzed: bxo  <cit> , bbxnl  <cit> , pxf  <cit> , jxf  <cit> , bc <dig>  <cit> , and txe and t1e  <cit> . we counted the qtls of these publications that were consistent : only  <dig>  of the  <dig> qtls detected by flexqtl had previously been identified. the remaining  <dig> qtls were only present in the other ten families or segregated in these eight families but remained below the significance threshold when using a conventional bi-parental approach. examples of the latter for strong to decisive qtls are qfd <dig> , qta <dig> , qmd <dig>  qfdp <dig>  qfdp <dig>  qfdp <dig>  and qssc <dig> for txe and t1e and qfd <dig>  qfd <dig> , qmd <dig>  qpsc <dig> and qfw <dig> for jxf, where heterozygous parents are predicted by the model  but no qtl was identified in the corresponding previously published single-progeny analyses. this illustrates the two advantages of the multi-progeny approach used in this work: the analysis of a large set of individuals from various crosses improves both genetic variability considered and the power of detection of the qtls.

thirteen of the  <dig> qtls with strong to decisive evidence are described here for the first time, taking into account all previous peach qtl studies . five of these qtls were identified for fdp , a character that has been rarely studied  and for which only one qtl with major effects has been described on g <dig>  probably because of the masking effect of this qtl on smaller qtls in single populations. other qtls related to ta , ssc  and fw  are particularly interesting because they are involved in important quality-related characters that are difficult to select for in breeding programs. the two remaining were one for md , which was predicted as heterozygous in seven of the peach commercial parents , and one for psc  segregating only in jxf. all these qtls, along with an estimation of the genotype of the genitors used are first-hand information for the selection of parents in breeding programs.

md and fdp are strongly correlated characters, where most of the qtls coincide , suggesting that they are the same, red skin color and ssc are characters typically influenced by the date of maturity. thus qmd <dig> may be also responsible for qpsc <dig> and qssc <dig> through pleiotropic effects of the md gene.

breeding values
a new element from our analysis, of great interest for peach improvement and extensively developed in a companion paper  <cit> , is the possibility of attaching a breeding value to the parents. selecting parents with high breeding values for target characters allows for more informed decisions at the moment of cross planning. breeding values also provide interesting information for inferring the mode of selection of different characters during peach evolution under domestication. characters submitted to strong directional selection should present extreme breeding values in commercial vs. exotic materials. this is the case for fruit weight and red skin color, where the lowest breeding values occurred in the materials involving wild or cultivated relatives  and the highest in the modern cultivars . in contrast, characters undergoing diversifying selection by modern breeding should exhibit a pattern where both extreme values would be found in the commercial varieties. md and the strongly correlated fdp are typically selected by breeders to cover a broad range of maturity dates where the diversifying selection model would fit. as predicted, commercial cultivars were found to have the highest , and the lowest  breeding values for md and fdp. other characters, such as ssc, ta and fd, do not have an obvious a priori pattern, of selection, for ssc, hybrids with one or both parents being exotic display the extremes of the breeding value distribution  x ‘pamirskij 5’ . this suggests that selection for this character in commercial breeding has been weak or ineffective, and that useful variability for breeding lines can be recovered from exotic materials. although ta had a narrow range of breeding values, the extreme values were exhibited by commercial cultivars , a pattern that suggests diversifying selection. fd is a character for which one would also predict a pattern of diversifying selection, considering the broad range of geographical distribution of the peach and the need for adaptation to an ample array of chilling requirements. the extremes of the distribution of breeding values were a hybrid between two commercial varieties  and one from a commercial and an exotic accession , suggesting a directional selection model. this trend is confirmed by the fact that other exotic parents were also among those having the lowest breeding values, such as ‘bc <dig> ’  and txe . one explanation could be that, although diversifying selection occurred for fd in the commercial peach materials, the variability available for fd within this pool is low compared to that of the extended prunus gene pool, where many additional alleles exist and emerge when interspecific hybrids are created. this hypothesis is moreover supported by the fact that three of the four qtls with strong to decisive evidence for this trait , those having the highest effects, were not detected in the set of commercial progenies analyzed.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the use of the flexqtl software in a large set of families our results provide a more comprehensive view of the genetic variability of some of the most relevant agronomic characters of peach, and a deeper knowledge of their genetic basis, with the detection of many more qtls, and identification of their effects and map positions with higher precision than with single population experiments. in addition, specific information on the parental qtl genotypes and their breeding values provides an efficient tool for parent selection in breeding programs. our results indicate that genetic variability can come from non-commercial genotypes even for agronomic characters. such exotic material was generally used for the introgression of resistant factors to biotic stresses in breeding programs  <cit>  but considered as a break to recover good fruit quality. on the contrary, this study strongly highlights the potential of using exotic material to enlarge the genetic basis in the commercial cultivar pool and improve agronomic characters. in a context of breeding for sustainable orchards using fewer pesticides, introducing exotic material in selection schemes acquires a particularly important interest.

other analyses with the same approach in prunus had more modest objectives, as they were done for a single character  <cit>  or with limited population sizes  <cit>  but, given the deeper knowledge of the pedigrees of the materials used by these authors, these analyses could be expanded to a broader set of genotypes, some not directly involved as parents of the progenies studied. in our study, we discarded this application of the software because of the wide range of our materials and the fact that some had an uncertain pedigree. an improvement of the results reported here would be to update and complete the pedigree information using available records and completing genotyping data for a larger collection of materials using the same snp chip used here  <cit> . the analysis performed also opens the door to a more integrated genetic analysis in peach, where new populations could be added to those studied here to build a more robust and complete landscape of the variability for traits of economic importance for peach and other prunus crops and relatives. this would require strengthening international collaborations, such as those already proven to work satisfactorily in european and us initiatives .
