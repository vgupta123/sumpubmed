BACKGROUND
chimpanzees  are still widely distributed across sub-saharan africa, and the species exploits a wide range of habitats including rainforests, ecotones and savannas  <cit> . across this range they exhibit considerable genetic  <cit> , behavioral  <cit>  and ecological diversity  <cit> . studies consisting mostly of samples from wild-born captive chimpanzees have given great insights regarding the phylogenetic history of this species, but genetic data from wild individuals remain sparse. recent studies of captive wild-born chimpanzees include datasets such as complete mitochondrial  genomes  <cit> , genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> , and complete genome sequences  <cit> . the overall picture to emerge from these studies suggests that chimpanzees are divided into two geographically- and genetically-defined groups: a western african group that includes p. t. verus and p. t. ellioti and a central/eastern african group that includes p. t. troglodytes and p. t. schweinfurthii  <cit>  . this classification is consistent with earlier studies using mtdna control region sequence diversity from wild individuals from nigeria and adjacent parts of cameroon, which suggested that animals in this region form a genetically distinct population of chimpanzees  <cit> , now widely recognized as p. t. ellioti  <cit> . these studies have also been important for understanding differences in subspecies population histories, and how these histories are connected to landscape and forest history. for example, the western and central/eastern groups appear to have split from one another very early in the history of this species. analysis of complete genomes suggests that since their genetic and geographic separation, these groups have experienced markedly different demographic histories, and the subspecies within each group show different patterns of population growth and decline throughout their respective histories  <cit> .figure  <dig>

while the phylogenetic relationships among chimpanzee subspecies are now well-resolved, their population structure, migration patterns and patterns of population growth still remain unknown, particularly in areas where the ranges of subspecies converge. this is mostly due to a lack of fine-scale geographic sampling of wild chimpanzee populations around areas where subspecies overlap, which has revealed mechanisms of diversification in gorillas  <cit> . analysis of mtdna from wild chimpanzees from nigeria and cameroon has suggested that the sanaga river delimits p. t. ellioti from p. t. troglodytes in southern cameroon  <cit> . this split is old, but incomplete, as there is a zone in central cameroon where the ranges of the mtdna haplotypes that define these two subspecies overlap. these findings suggest that some introgression may have occurred between these two subspecies  <cit>  or that a pattern of isolation-by-distance  might be revealed by more fine scale population sampling across this region.

the sanaga river has been proposed to delimit the distributions of several primate species and subspecies  <cit>  including chimpanzees  <cit> . this region of africa also contains diverse habitats. cameroon lies at the intersection of two major rainforest biomes, the guinean and congolian rainforests  <cit>  . these two forests converge in central cameroon and are connected by a zone of open woodland, savannah and riparian forest  <cit>  which has been termed an ‘ecotone’  <cit> . therefore, denser geographic sampling and more comprehensive genetic data are necessary to tease apart the relative contributions of forest history and biogeographic boundaries in driving patterns of genetic variation in chimpanzees.

this study uses dna extracted from fecal and hair samples to examine the population structure and genetic history of chimpanzees from cameroon and eastern nigeria at a fine geographic scale across this ecologically diverse region . the overall goals of the study were to use mtdna haplotypes along with microsatellite genotype profiles of wild individuals to:  test between a variety of hypotheses for the presence and type of population structure , including  panmixia,  isolation-by-distance,  population structure with complete isolation, and  population structure with ongoing migration;  test the specific hypothesis that the sanaga river has been important in delimiting the range of p. t. ellioti from neighboring p. t. troglodytes; and  compare the demographic histories of these two subspecies by inferring the time to their most recent common ancestor , their historical and current effective population sizes, and finally, the rates and directions of migration between them.figure  <dig>

RESULTS
dataset preparation
we calculated pairwise estimates of relatedness for all pairs of genotyped individuals using the software program coancestry  <cit>  and removed duplicate individuals and those that were closely related to one another. a total of three individuals with a relatedness index value  <cit>  above  <dig>  were determined to be either identical individuals or highly related and were excluded from all further analyses. the analyses presented here include mtdna sequencing data from  <dig> sequences from  <dig> sampling locations, and microsatellite data were included from  <dig> unrealated individuals from  <dig> sampling locations .

in order to ensure that all of the genetic markers were selectively neutral, and therefore suitable for further analysis, the data were subjected to various neutrality tests. we found that all microsatellite loci met expectations of hardy-weinberg equilibrium and expectations of neutrality . we further subjected the microsatellite loci to an outlier test based on observed heterozygosity and fst, and all  <dig> loci fell within the acceptable range of neutrality .

mtdna diversity analysis
we constructed a median-joining mtdna haplotype network  and plotted a frequency distribution of inferred haplotypes found at each sampling location across cameroon and nigeria . the results were similar to observations from previous studies  <cit> . specifically, there are two primary mtdna haplogroups, each comprised of two distinct haplotypes, found across the study area. one haplogroup  occurs only in individuals north of the sanaga river . the second haplogroup  occurs in p. t. troglodytes primarily south of the sanaga. however, these two haplogroups overlap with each other in the ecotone in central cameroon, north of the sanaga river and east of the mbam river. interestingly, the p. t. troglodytes–like mtdna sequences found in the ecotone belong to a single sub-type within haplogroup 2a. this suggests either a pattern of historic gene flow between the subspecies, which is consistent with other studies  <cit> , or alternatively that there was a single migration event from south to north of the sanaga followed by the proliferation of this haplotype exclusively within central cameroon.figure  <dig>

overall, the results of the mtdna haplotype analysis suggest that panmixia does not describe the population structure of chimpanzees. there is clear evidence that there are two main mtdna haplogroups: a group in eastern nigeria and western cameroon and a second group in southern cameroon. the geographic distributions of these groups converge with one another in central cameroon, with an abrupt transition between them along the sanaga river. overlap between these groups appears to be confined to the ecotone of central cameroon, which also coincides with the confluence of the sanaga with the mbam river--another river of biogeographic significance for primates  <cit> . it is also worthy to note that p. t. ellioti in central cameroon are more diverse than those in western cameroon/eastern nigeria . lower haplotype diversity in western cameroon and eastern nigeria, which has been proposed to be an area of putative pleistocene refugia  <cit> , may either be the result of local extinctions of haplotypes, or a diversification of mtdna haplotypes as the result of increased habitat variation in central cameroon.

we grouped results of the analysis of molecular variance   for mtdna sequences according to variation:  within populations ;  among populations in groups ; and  among groups north or south of the sanaga river , the major population partition indicated in previous studies  <cit> . dividing the haplotypes by their origins north versus south of the sanaga river accounted for  <dig> % of the variation among groups, whereas  <dig> % of the variation occurred within sampled populations within these groups. this population pattern is markedly different from the partitioning of genetic variation found in p. t. schweinfurthii  <cit>  where less than 2% of the genetic variation were reported to have accounted for the differences between p. t. schweinfurthii groups that were separated from one another by more than a  <dig> km straight-line distance , whereas the groups included in this amova are separated by no more than  <dig> km at their points of closest sampling north versus south of the sanaga river . similarly, results for a spatial amova   <cit>  that assumed two populations  were present across the study area confirmed the geographic grouping of sampling locations north and south of the sanaga river. the division of haplotypes according to geographically homogeneous groups, accounted for  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the variation within sample locations within these groups . this pattern was statistically significant and recapitulated the results of the amova .table  <dig>

bamova analysis reported by goldberg and ruvolo  <cit> . the samples included eastern chimpanzees  divided into two groups of samples recovered from chimpanzees in northeastern democratic republic of congo  and ‘eastern forests’ that includes sampling locations in rwanda, tanzania and uganda. these two groupings are separated from one another by more than 600km straight-line distance.



we generated two sets of mismatch distributions to examine whether the sampled populations had experienced recent botttlenecks, population expansions or demographic stability . individuals were grouped into either two or three separate groups, as identified by microsatellite cluster analysis. none of the mismatch distributions were found to be significantly different from the null model, which indicates demographic stability of all populations included in the analyses   <cit> .

microsatellite genotype analysis
mantel tests of  <dig> microsatellite loci  revealed a significant  pattern of isolation-by-distance across the study area as a whole. however, the relationship between genetic and geograpahic distance is weak. the r <dig> value is low  and overall accounts for for less than 2% of the total genetic variation present across the study area. because isolation-by-distance only weakly explains the population structure of chimpanzees, we next examined the number and distribution of populations across the study area.figure  <dig>

a principal components analysis  was carried out to examine how many different gene pools were present across the study region. the pca shown in figure  <dig> classified the first four eigenvectors as significant . the first principal component  separated chimpanzees north and south of the sanaga river , and accounted for 71% of the total extracted variation in the dataset. pc  <dig> accounted for 21% of the total extracted variation and separated p. t. ellioti chimpanzees into two groups: one cluster of individuals mostly from the forests of western cameron , purple) and another cluster of individuals from the ecotone in central cameroon , green). pc  <dig> and pc <dig> accounted for 5% and 3% respectively, and separated small clusters of individuals from the same sampling locations from the rest of the dataset. these final pcs were sample location specific and are possibly the result of sampling bias .figure  <dig>

results of the cluster analysis in tess  <cit>  are shown in figures 6a and b. we used several methods to infer the maximum number of populations, k, represented by this dataset. deviance information criteria   <cit>  values suggest that kmax is  <dig> . in contrast, the post hoc statistic, Δk  <cit> , suggests a kmax of  <dig> . overall, these results suggest that there is a primary separation along the banks of the sanaga river. p. t. ellioti,  is found north and west of the river, whereas p. t. troglodytes  occurs south of the sanaga . there is additional evidence of a population subdivision within p. t. ellioti: a population located in the forests of western cameron , purple) and another population located in the ecotone in central cameroon , green) .figure  <dig>

the spatial interpolations generated by tess ad-mixer  <cit>  show the separation of these two populations  corresponds to banks of the sanaga river . setting k =  <dig>  which was supported by the Δk statistic and the pca, provided evidence of further subdivision within p. t. ellioti. setting k =  <dig> and k =  <dig> using tess  distinguished the same populations as pc <dig> and pc <dig> . the tess ad-mixer  <cit>  results show that this subdivision exists exclusively north of the sanaga river, and the east–west division of populations  coincides with the mbam river, although this division is much less pronounced than the division of p. t. ellioti and p. t. troglodytes at the sanaga river , and there is predicted overlap between these two groups in nigeria, north of the mbam.

values for three measures of genetic differentiation, d <dig>  <cit> , rst  <cit> , and δμ <dig>  <cit> , are shown in additional file  <dig> between the three populations identified in the cluster analyses . all three measures were correlated with one another; d <dig> and rst, r2 =  <dig> ; d <dig> and δμ <dig>  r2 =  <dig> ; and rst and δμ <dig>  r2 =  <dig> ; and all pairwise differences were significantly different from null expectations of the data . genetic differentiation was highest between populations of chimpanzee across the sanaga river  and lowest between populations of chimpanzee north of the sanaga river  versus p. t. ellioti ). additional file  <dig> shows the estimated number of migrants exchanged between populations per generation  as calculated using in the arlequin version  <dig>  software package  <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig> migrants per generation are exchanged between populations located north vs. south of the sanaga river, and approximately  <dig> migrants exchanged between the two populations found north of the sanaga river in western and central cameroon, respectively.

allele richness and number of private alleles by population, corrected for unequal population size, is shown in additional files 10a and 10b. allele richness varied considerably between populations, with p. t. troglodytes displaying almost twice as many distinct alleles per locus compared to p. t. ellioti  and p. t. ellioti . however, the mean number of private alleles per locus did not vary considerably between regions, although we observed a similar pattern, with p. t. troglodytes exhibiting the greatest number of private alleles, when corrected for unequal sample size. additional file 10c shows the mean number of shared private alleles between the three combinations of population pairs, when corrected for equal population size. interestingly, the highest number of shared private alleles occurs between p. t. ellioti  and p. t. troglodytes, with the other two population pairs exhibiting similar numbers of shared alleles.

population history
we pooled the mtdna and microsatellite data together for analysis in ima  <cit> , which allowed for the estimation of several population parameters , including descendant  and ancestral  population sizes, time of divergence and migration rates between each of the three populations recovered by the cluster analysis  and pca . all three population comparisons yielded well-resolved posterior probability distributions for each population parameter . both p. t. ellioti  and p. t. ellioti  last shared a common ancestor with p. t. troglodytes approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kya, which is consistent with other studies using similar data  <cit> . the two p. t. ellioti populations last shared a common ancestor with each other much more recently, about  <dig> kya. the results of these analyses also included estimates of ancestral and descendant effective population sizes for all pairs of populations. estimates of effective population size for the present p. t. ellioti  population were consistent across runs, showing an effective population size of approximately  <dig>  individuals. there was considerably more variation detected between comparisons for effective population sizes of p. t. ellioti  and p. t. troglodytes. in p. t. ellioti , effective population size was estimated to be between approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  individuals. the current effective population size of p. t. troglodytes in southern cameroon, may range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  individuals. the estimates for ancestral population size show that p. t. ellioti north of the sanaga river were approximately  <dig>  individuals, and that the ancestral populations of chimpanzees likely ranged between approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  individuals. the number of migrants per generation was also estimated for all three pairs of populations. between  <dig>  and  <dig>  migrants per generation have been exchanged between populations across the sanaga river, since the initial separation of p. t. troglodytes and p. t. ellioti. higher levels of migration were found between the p. t. ellioti populations .table  <dig>

overall the results of the ima suggest very clearly that the gene pools of p. t. ellioti and p. t. troglodytes are mostly, but not completely isolated from one another . we conclude that these two subspecies are characterized by an isolation-with-migration population history model  <cit>  for several reasons. the results of the ima analysis shows that the p. t. ellioti populations last shared a common ancestor with p. t. troglodytes approximately 200– <dig> kya, and since this separation they have exchanged approximately one migrant per generation. moderate levels of gene flow  between populations should prevent divergence, under a model that assumes that drift occupies the dominant role in population differentiation  <cit> . population divergence in the presence of gene flow is often cited as evidence that local adapatation is driving the separation of two or more populations  <cit> . however, the observed value of migration between p. t. elioti and p. t. troglodytes  is a minimal threshold  <cit> , making it difficult to fully distinguish whether allopatric speciation or local adaptation has occupied the dominant role in driving this separation.

demographic histories can be influenced by climatic histories. the climate of africa has been affected by oscillations in global temperature and species assemblages in tropical africa are often influenced by these changes, particularly the last glacial maximum   <cit> . it is also important to understand demographic history in the context of climatic histories. interestingly, the dates of divergence between p. t. ellioti and p. t. troglodytes predate the lgm, but do coincide with a pronounced glacial episode approximately 250kya  <cit> , with evidence that sand dunes extended all the way to the niger delta  <cit> .

it may be possible that these fluctuations in local climate may have influenced the sanaga river, but little is known regarding its historical course and size. rivers are known to dramatically change in course and size over time, thus affecting their ability to act as dispersal barriers  <cit> . thus, it is possible that chimpanzee migration across the sanaga could have occurred in bursts when river size was minimal, but we are unable to directly test this hypothesis, given the nature of the genetic data used in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the most comprehensive genetic dataset available for wild chimpanzees from cameroon, which is important because it is the only known area where the distributions of two chimpanzee subspecies overlap. microsatellite genotype profiles from  <dig> unrelated individuals and mtdna haplotypes of  <dig> individuals were used to test between a variety of hypotheses for the presence and type of population structure of chimpanzees across the study area, including  panmixia,  isolation-by-distance,  population structure with complete isolation, and  population structure with ongoing migration. overall, the results suggest that p. t. ellioti and p. t. troglodytes represent genetically distinct populations in cameroon, confirming results from previous studies of captive chimpanzee with inferred origins  <cit>  and previous analyses of mtdna haplotypes of wild individuals  <cit> . surprisingly, we found additional evidence that p. t. ellioti consists of two genetically- and geographically-distinct populations. one population is located in forested regions of eastern nigeria and western cameroon and the second is located in central cameroon, in a savanna-woodland mosaic that occurs between the mbam and sanaga rivers. the results of the ima analysis show that the p. t. ellioti populations and p. t. troglodytes diverged from one another 200– <dig> kya, and have experience moderately high  gene flow since . this, coupled with the overlap of these populations in the mtdna haplotype network analysis  and microsatellite cluster analyses  call in question the role of the sanaga river in acting as a biogeographic barrier that has separated these chimpanzee subspecies.

several riverine barriers have been proposed as biogeographic boundaries for primates in the region  <cit> , but the role of habitat variation in driving primate speciation remains unknown. for instance, in addition to being important for chimpanzees, the sanaga river has been proposed to influence the distribution of several pairs of primates, including mandrillus leucophaeus/m. sphinx, cercopithecus erythrotis/c. cephus, c. nictitans martini/c. n. nictitans, and c. pogonias pogonias/c. p. grayi  <cit> . these pairs of primates all occupy vastly different habitats and niches  <cit> . this observation suggests that other factors along with, or instead of, the sanaga river may be important in separating the distribution of these species, subspecies and populations across the region. it is well documented that non-riverine barriers, such as the dahomey gap, also separate taxa, and likely separates p. t. verus from p. t. ellioti   <cit> . other factors have also been proposed to shape african tropical biodiversity in the region  <cit> . thus, it is important that we reevaluate the role that the allopatric speciation, as driven by the sanaga river, may have had in governing distributions of rainforest taxa, particularly primates.

cameroon lies at the intersection of two major rainforest biomes. the congolian rainforest extends northward into southern cameroon from central africa, and the guinean rainforest extends southward into eastern nigeria and western cameroon from western africa . these two biomes converge in central cameroon at the location of a pronounced ecotone  <cit> , which is composed of open woodland, savannah and riparian forest  <cit> . recent studies in this area that have combined genetic, morphological and environmental data have found that this ecotone appears to drive evolutionary diversification in insects  <cit> , reptiles  <cit>  and birds  <cit> . this is especially interesting, given that neutral processes are unlikely to explain the population history of chimpanzees in the region, as they seem to follow an isolation-with-migration model. the results of the mtdna haplotype analysis shows an overlap of the two major haplogroups , and the results of the cluster analysis show a distinct deme of chimpanzee in this ecotone . however, the loci included in this study meet expectations of neutral evolution, and thus, do not allow for us to draw additional conclusions regarding how ecological variation may drive diversification in chimpanzees. these observations underscore the importance of testing alternative hypotheses with loci that that are neutral and under selection.

even though the migration rate between p. t. ellioti and p. t. troglodytes  is a minimal threshold to propose that selection has driven the separation of these populations, there is mounting evidence that allopatric speciation alone cannot account for the divergence of these populations. a complimentary study of the ecological niche differentiation in these populations shows that the demes of chimpanzees found in this study also occupy significantly different niches  <cit> , suggesting that environmental variation contributes to driving the differentiation of these populations. the alternative hypothesis, that speciation in chimpanzees is driven by allopatric speciation, would be explained by an absence of niche divergence among these three demes  <cit> . furthermore, in another complimentary study we found significant associations between genetic differentiation in these three demes and environmental variation across the study area  <cit> , which led us to conclude that these populations likely follow a pattern of isolation-by-environment  <cit> , a relationship between populations that arises as a result of local adaptation to different environments. taken together, these findings are consistent with the observation that chimpanzees in cameroon and nigeria may be adapted to their local evironments, and that this variation has contributed to the genetic differentiation of chimpanzee subspecies.

a broader understanding about the role of local adaptation in chimpanzees and other taxa may provide important clues regarding why this region of africa contains such a high proportion of the earth’s biodiversity. future studies that more closely examine the history of the sanaga river and the role of historic climatic variation in shaping chimpanzee genetic diversity are crucial for building this understanding. additionally, a better understanding of how chimpanzee social stuctures and dispersal patterns are shaped by habitat variation, and how this may contribute to regional genetic diversity, is of vital importance to unravelling the forces that have helped make this region such an incredibly diverse place on earth.
