BACKGROUND
soil salinity is one of major abiotic stresses for plants in the world, posing a great threat to agricultural production. at present, approximately 20 % of the globally cultivated land and nearly half of the total irrigated land are adversely affected by salinity  <cit> . on the other hand, salt tolerance shows a wide variation in plant species. among cereals, rice  is the most sensitive, and durum wheat  is sensitive and bread wheat  is moderately tolerant; while barley  is the most tolerant  <cit> . consequently, barley is often considered as an excellent model crop in the attempts to understand the mechanisms of salt tolerance in cereal crops.

barley is the fourth most important cereal crop in the world in terms of the planting area, only behind maize , wheat and rice, and it is mainly used as animal feed and raw material in brewing industries  <cit> . moreover, barley is well-known for its wide adaptability to various environments  <cit> . however, the genetic diversity of the cultivated barley becomes narrower due to artificial activities, including modern breeding and intensive planting. comparatively, wild barley accessions  and other hordeum species contain wider genetic diversity and are rich in elite alleles  <cit> . it was reported that the cultivated barley contained only around 40 % of alleles in h. spontaneum  <cit> . obviously, wild barley may provide novel alleles or genes for breeding, in particular those with high tolerance to abiotic stresses  <cit> .

wild barley is the progenitor of cultivated barley and mainly distributed in mediterranean area, fertile crescent and qinghai-tibet plateau  <cit> . a large number of wild barley accessions collected from qinghai-tibet region  display wide genetic diversity and closely genetic homology to cultivated barley, and are recently proved equal contribution to the genome of modern cultivated barley as the wild barley from the near east fertile crescent  <cit> . many accessions with strong tolerance to abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity and aluminum toxicity, were identified from tibetan wild barley . for example, in our previous study, we identified elite salt-tolerant genotypes from around  <dig> accessions of tibetan wild barley , showing a better salinity tolerance than cm <dig>  a well-known salt-tolerant cultivar  <cit> .

evaluation of salt tolerance among different species or genotypes within a species is quite difficult by one trait  <cit> . so far, many physiological parameters were used to identify salt tolerance, including relative root length  <cit> , leaf cell elongation  <cit> , relative dry weights of shoots and roots  <cit> , na and k contents  <cit> , and k/na ratio  <cit> . among these traits, relative shoot dry weight might be a more real and reliable trait for reflecting plant growth under salt stress, as shoot growth is generally more sensitive than root growth in response to salinity. munns and tester  <cit>  divided the inhibition of shoot growth into two phases: a rapid response to osmotic pressure and a slow response to toxic level of na accumulation in plant tissues. a significantly negative correlation between shoot na concentration and relative shoot dry biomass was observed among tibetan wild barley accessions  <cit> . shoot growth is the fundamental for normal ontogenesis of plants and yield formation. thus, it is imperative to reveal the mechanism of salt tolerance underlying shoot growth in order to developing the salt tolerant cultivars.

many methods have been used to identify a single gene or multi-genes network responding to salt stress, including linkage  mapping, association mapping , and high-throughput omic techniques, such as transcriptomics, ionomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis  <cit> . in barley, many qtls associated with salt tolerance have been identified  <cit> . a single locus controlling salt tolerance, hvnax <dig>  was identified on the short arm of chromosome 7h from a wild barley accession cpi-71284- <dig>  which controls sodium  accumulation in shoots under salt stress  <cit> . however, very few genes associated with salt tolerance have been cloned from these qtls in barley, mainly because of its huge genome. fortunately, omic methods are high-throughput and efficient for comprehensive understanding of salt-induced changes of gene-protein-metabolite system at genome-wide scale  <cit> . previously, salt-induced changes of transcriptome, proteome, ionome and metabolome were revealed by comparing the salt tolerant cultivars with sensitive ones, or comparing the wild barley accessions with cultivars . compared with these findings at transcript level, the molecular responses at protein and metabolic levels are more close to the adaptive or tolerant mechanism under salt stress. these researches may provide some valuable information about the difference between salt-tolerant and sensitive genotypes in their response to salt stress; however, most of the experimental materials used in these researches did not show predominant difference in salt tolerance.

as mentioned above, we identified some accessions of tibetan wild barley differing dramatically in salt tolerance  in our previous study  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the genotypic difference in salt tolerance are still unknown. hence, xz <dig> and xz <dig> were used to investigate the changes of shoot ionome, metabolome and proteome in the response to salt stress of  <dig> and 400 mm at seedling stage, so as to understand the adaptive approach of barley shoots to salt stress.

RESULTS
the influence of salt stress on shoot growth of the two wild barley genotypes
two wild barley genotypes, xz <dig> and xz <dig>  which were identified from about  <dig> tibetan wild barley accessions, differed greatly in salt stress tolerance  <cit> . currently, shoot growth of the two genotypes was compared under moderate  and high  salinity . after  <dig> days salt treatment, shoot length and biomass were significantly reduced for the two genotypes in comparison with their controls, with xz <dig> reducing by  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, and xz <dig> by  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in the shoot length under moderate and high salinity, respectively . correspondingly, for the shoot dry weight, xz <dig> reduced by  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, and xz <dig> by  <dig>  and  <dig>  % under the two salt levels, respectively . obviously, xz <dig> showed the higher salt tolerance than xz <dig> in terms of the shoot growth.fig.  <dig> shoot growth performance of xz <dig> and xz <dig> under control , moderate  and high  salinity conditions.  pictures of shoot-plants of xz <dig> and xz <dig> after  <dig> days salt treatment and control conditions, bar shows 10 cm;  shoot length  and  shoot dry weight  of xz <dig> and xz <dig>  data are means ± sd of three biological replicates  and different small letters indicate significant difference at p <  <dig>  by the one-way anova test




the influence of salt stress on shoot ionome of the two wild barley genotypes
the control and treatment samples of both genotypes could be separated by the first principal component  using principal component analysis , which accounted for  <dig>  % of the total variation in shoot ionomes . the most important factor contributing to the pc <dig> was na . shoot na concentration was increased markedly when plants were exposed to salt treatments. under 400 mm nacl, na concentrations in the two genotypes was almost increased by two folds in comparison with the plants under 200 mm nacl .fig.  <dig> shoot ionome variation in xz <dig> and xz <dig> and components of elements to the pc <dig> and the pc <dig>   shoot ionome variation among samples detects by the pca after  <dig> days salt treatment and control conditions;  the components of elements to the pc <dig> and the pc <dig>  ck: controls; s200: 200 mm nacl; s400: 400 mm nacl ; pc1: the first principal component; pc2: the second principal component

correspondingly, the pc <dig> could basically separate the samples between genotypes , and the major factors contributing to the pc <dig> were na and mg . xz <dig> had distinctly higher shoot na concentration than xz <dig>  being  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold under moderate and high salt levels, respectively . meanwhile, the concentrations of other macroelements  and microelements  in shoots were significantly decreased for both genotypes under salt stress . the changed pattern of these elements in shoots was quite similar for both genotypes, but xz <dig> had higher shoot mg concentration than xz <dig>  irrespectively of salt level. obviously, the results indicate that xz <dig> is a salt tolerant genotype with low shoot na accumulation.

the influence of salt stress on shoot metabolome of the two wild barley genotypes
totally,  <dig> metabolites were identified in the shoots of the two genotypes . shoot metabolomes of the two genotypes were dramatically changed under salt stress in comparison with their controls. the control and salt-treated samples could be clearly separated by the pc <dig>  and the samples between the two genotypes were not well separated by the pc <dig> . thus, the partial least squares-discriminant analysis  was used to determine the difference between the two genotypes .fig.  <dig> shoot metabolome variation in xz <dig> and xz <dig> and top  <dig> metabolites for the pc <dig>   shoot metabolome variation among samples detected by the pca;  shoot metabolome variation among samples and the  <dig> top metabolites contributing to the pc <dig>  were detected by the partial least squares-discriminant analysis , respectively. five biological replicates  set for each treatment and samples with false determination were deducted from the data. ck: controls; s200: 200 mm nacl; s400: 400 mm nacl; pc1: the first principal component; pc2: the second principal component




without salt stress, the metabolites contributing to the pc <dig> were dominated by cerotinic acid, leucrose and other  <dig> metabolites between the two genotypes . under moderate salt stress, the pc <dig> was dominated by hydroxycinnamic acid, methyl-phosphate, ascorbate and other metabolites . while under high salt stress, the dominated compounds were allothreonine, leucrose, n-acetyl-l-leucine and other  <dig> metabolites . among them,  <dig> of the  <dig> top metabolites contributing to the pc <dig> were identified in the two salt treatments, but not in the controls, including allothreonine, n-acetyl-l-leucine, glutamine, methyl-phosphate, malonamide and aspartate.

accumulation of some sugars, including fructose, raffinose, sophorose and sorbose, was increased in both genotypes under moderate and high salt level relative to control. melibiose and sedoheptulose were up-accumulated specifically under moderate salinity, while under high salinity galactose and talose were dramatically increased in the two genotypes . some metabolites responded to salt stress in the genotype-dependent pattern. in details, salt stress caused a significant reduction of sucrose concentration  in xz <dig>  but the difference is not obvious in xz <dig>  the metabolites involved in glycolysis pathway also showed much larger down-accumulation in xz <dig> than in xz <dig> under high salinity, including glucose  and pyruvate ; whereas glucose-1-p  and fructose-6-p  were up-accumulated in xz <dig> and less changed in xz <dig>  obviously, metabolic level of glycolysis was less affected by salt stress in the salt-tolerant xz <dig> than in the sensitive genotype, xz <dig> .fig.  <dig> changes in metabolites mapped to the metabolic pathways in the shoots of xz <dig> and xz <dig> after salt treatments. metabolites in orange indicate significant  up-accumulation and in blue show significant  down-accumulation, in comparison of metabolite normalized content under salt stress and control conditions. metabolic pathways were constructed according to kegg  metabolic database. ck: controls; s200: 200 mm nacl; s400: 400 mm nacl




the tca cycle was significantly enhanced in xz <dig> under salt stress, as reflected by up-accumulation of citric acid , aconitic acid , isocitric acid  and succinic acid , while no significant change was detected for citric acid and succinic acid in xz <dig>  the enhancement of the tca cycle resulted in the dramatic increase of organic acids  and amino acids  concentrations . for an instance, 2-oxoglutarate showed no significant change probably due to the enhanced synthesis of proline, a down-stream metabolite, which increased by  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds in xz <dig> and by  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds in xz <dig> under moderate and high salt levels, respectively .

in addition, allothreonine, n-acetyl-l-leucine, glutamine, methyl-phosphate, malonamide and aspartate, contributing to the separation of shoot metabolome between the two genotypes under salt stress, as mentioned above, had much higher concentration in xz <dig> than in xz <dig> .

the influence of salt stress on shoot proteome of the two wild barley genotypes
among  <dig> proteins identified in the shoots,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins for xz <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins for xz <dig>  showed significant up-regulation and down-regulation under 200 mm nacl compared with their controls, respectively . correspondingly, there were  <dig> and  <dig> proteins for xz <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins for xz <dig>  showing up-regulation and down-regulation under 400 mm nacl, respectively . the results indicate that shoot proteome is more dramatically changed under high salinity than under moderate salinity, and in the sensitive genotype than in the tolerant genotype. gene ontology  annotation of these differentially accumulated proteins showed that proteins involved in three major categories were most enriched after salt treatments including biological process, molecular function and cellular component, respectively .fig.  <dig> global comparison of proteome profiles in the shoots of xz <dig> and xz <dig> after salt treatments. totally  <dig> proteins were identified by itraq in shoots of xz <dig> and xz <dig> after  <dig> days salt treatment and control conditions and the numbers in the figure indicate the numbers of proteins with significant up-regulation  or down-regulation  for each comparison. red and blue arrows represent up- and down- regulated proteins, respectively. ck: controls; s200: 200 mm nacl; s400: 400 mm nacl




among  <dig> differentially accumulated proteins, some showed genotype-dependent response to salt stress . in details, aquaporin , apolipoprotein , aaa-type atpase , vacuolar atp synthase subunit , reticulon-like protein  and a conserved hypothetical protein , considered as membrane proteins, were significantly up-regulated in xz <dig> under high salinity, but not in xz <dig> . however, some ion transporters, including potassium transporter , mrp - and pdr - like abc transporter, nitrate/chlorate transporter  and chloride channel  <dig>  were not significantly regulated in the two genotypes under salt stress. two proton pumps of plasma membrane h+-atpase  also showed no significant regulation under salt stress in both genotypes . in fact, as mentioned above, the response of those transporters to salt stress could not explain the genotypic difference in shoot na accumulation.table  <dig> the fold changes of proteins related to transporters in shoots of xz <dig> and xz <dig> under control ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm salt conditions

on the other hand, sugar transporter  showed a remarkable down-regulation under high salinity in xz <dig> , but up-regulation for xz <dig>  . however, sucrose synthase  showed significant up-regulation in xz <dig> under salt stress, but not in xz <dig> . meanwhile, some proteins related to sucrose metabolism also showed up-regulation specifically in xz <dig>  including sucrose-phosphate synthase  <dig> , udp-glucose 6-dehydrogenase  and glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase . hexokinase  and pyruvate kinase , two limited enzymes in glycolysis pathway, showed significant up-regulation and down-regulation in xz <dig> under high salinity , respectively, but had less change in xz <dig>  suggesting that glycolysis was more severely affected by salt stress in the sensitive genotype than in the tolerant genotype. the current results are consistent with those obtained in the metabolomic study. citrate synthase  which is involved in tca cycle, showed a significant up-regulation in xz <dig> under high salinity, but not in xz <dig>  moreover, glutamate decarboxylase , glutamine synthetase , delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase  , aspartate aminotransferase  and asparagine synthetase , had more increase in xz <dig> than in xz <dig> under salt stress , resulting in a dramatic enhancement of proline and other amino acids synthesis. the result is also consistent with the findings in metabolomic analysis. on the other hand, some proteins were down-regulated in xz <dig>  including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase , ribose-5-phosphate isomerase precursor , glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase  and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  <dig> , but not in xz <dig> . in short, the current results indicate that xz <dig> were much more affected by salt stress than xz <dig> in shoot proteome.table  <dig> the fold changes of proteins related to metabolic processes in shoots of xz <dig> and xz <dig> under control ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm salt conditions

discussion
high-throughput omic techniques have been used to investigate complex molecular response underlying salt tolerance in crops . however, no related study has been done to reveal the genotypic differences of wild barleys in molecular responses to salt stress. in the present study, the ionomic, metabolomic and proteomic profiles in the shoots of two tibetan wild barley accessions were compared under different salt levels.

salt stress causes growth inhibition of plant roots and shoots, while shoot growth is generally more severely affected  <cit> . the genotypic comparison in shoot ionomic responses to salt stress showed that xz <dig> maintained lower na concentration than xz <dig> , being consistent with its less inhibition of the shoot growth. obviously, the difference in shoot na concentration between the two genotypes may be a key factor attributing to the genotypic difference in shoot growth. it is commonly recognized that the salt-tolerant barley cultivars are capable for maintaining higher k/na ratios in comparison with the sensitive cultivars under salt stress  <cit> . the same result was also obtained in our previous study that relative shoot dry weight was significantly and negatively correlated with shoot na concentration  <cit> . in this study, we also compared the difference of shoot proteomes between xz <dig> and xz <dig> under salt stress. re-establishing homeostasis, especially for k/na homeostasis, is considered as a critical mechanism for achieving higher tolerance in plants under salt stress  <cit> . to date, proton pumps , which provide energy source for ion transporters across plasma membrane and tonoplast, and na/h antiporters  and na or k transporters , have been identified in various plants  <cit> . in this study, although some membrane associated proteins were up-regulated in xz <dig>  but two plasma membrane h+-atpase , potassium transporter , mrp- and pdr- like abc transporter, nitrate/chlorate transporter  and chloride channel  <dig>  remained little change in terms of protein abundance under salt stress for both genotypes . thus, it may be speculated that the ionic response  in shoots to salt stress is probably regulated by proton pumps and ion transporters associated with root-to-shoot translocation. on the other hand, the changed pattern of other macroelements  and microelements  under salt stress is not associated with the genotypic difference in the shoot growth.

salt-induced osmotic stress causes shoot growth inhibition immediately when na concentration reaches a threshold level in shoots  <cit> . in order to adapt to osmotic stress, plants can elevate the concentration of compatible solutes in cytoplasm . we compared the two wild barley genotypes in the response of the compatible solutes to salt stress. compared with xz <dig>  xz <dig> had much more proline accumulation under salinity salt stress . similar finding was also reported in the cultivated barley. salt sensitive cultivar clipper accumulated 4-fold higher proline in shoots than the tolerant cultivar sahara when they were exposed to 100 mm nacl  <cit> . ∆1-pyrroline-5-carboxylase synthase , regulating proline accumulation, was rapidly induced by salt stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . correspondingly, the results of proteomic analysis also showed that the up-regulated fold of p5cs  was larger in xz <dig>  than that in xz <dig>  under 400 mm salt stress. in addition, some other compatible solutes, including inositol and xylitol, had also more accumulation in xz <dig> than in xz <dig> . accumulation of the straight-chain polyols, mannitol, inositol and sorbitol, is reported to be correlated with stress tolerance in plants  <cit> . the current results indicated that xz <dig> suffered from more serious osmotic stress due to higher shoot na accumulation under salt stress compared with xz <dig>  and correspondingly lead to a higher accumulation of compatible solutes.

proteomic analysis also showed that the proteins involved in ros scavenging and defense were up-regulated in both genotypes under salt stress, including glutathione-s-transferases , class iii peroxidase  and peroxidase  . those proteins were also identified in the cultivated barley exposed to salt stress  <cit> . therefore it may be suggested that ros scavenging and defense is a common mechanism of salt tolerance in barley. however, the salt-sensitive genotype xz <dig> enriched more proteins to participate in those metabolic process or catalytic activities than the salt-tolerant genotype xz <dig> under moderate and high salinity conditions .

as expected, glucose concentration in shoots was dramatically reduced for both xz <dig> and xz <dig> under high salinity, with xz <dig> having more reduction than xz <dig>  widodo et al.  <cit>  found the similar result in the shoots of two barley cultivars differing in salt tolerance exposed to long term salt stress, and no significant difference was detected between the two cultivars in glucose synthesis. on the other hand, the proteins associated with photosynthesis, including rubisco subunit  and chloroplast chaperonin  <dig>  were significantly down-regulated under salt stress in xz <dig>  but not in xz <dig>  in some proteomic studies, photosynthesis related proteins were also found to be down-regulated in the sensitive genotypes  <cit> . obviously, xz <dig> was more stable in photosynthesis under salt stress than xz <dig> 

the two wild barley genotypes also showed the marked difference in the response of metabolisms to salt stress, with xz <dig> being less affected than xz <dig>  on the whole . the similar result was also detected in the cultivated barley  <cit> . sugars act not only as osmoprotectants for maintaining osmotic balance and stabilizing macromolecules under salt stress, but also can provide energy sources to plants for growth  <cit> . the concentration of sucrose was not affected by salt treatment in the shoots of xz <dig>  but  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold decreases were detected in the shoots of xz <dig> under moderate and high salinity, respectively . correspondingly, the protein level of sucrose synthase  was significantly increased in the shoots of xz <dig>  but not in xz <dig>  meanwhile, some proteins related to sugar metabolism were correspondingly up-regulated under salt stress in xz <dig>  including hexokinase , sucrose-phosphate synthase  <dig> , udp-glucose 6-dehydrogenase  and glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase   . on the other hand, up-regulated g6pd could catalyze oxidative phase in the pentose-phosphate pathway to produce more nadph for eliminating ros under salt stress  <cit> , which cooperated with the enhanced glutathione-s-transferases and peroxidases as mentioned above. in short, the current results indicate that xz <dig> remained less change in sugar metabolisms in comparison with xz <dig> under salt stress.

it was reported that the intermediate metabolites involved in glycolysis and tca cycle were reduced under salt stress for both barley and maize  <cit> . in this study, the metabolites associated with glycolysis were significantly down-regulated in xz <dig>  being consistent with the previous findings. in contrast, the concentrations of the metabolites  involved in tca cycle were dramatically up-regulated under salt stress in xz <dig>  however, the concentrations of pyruvate and citric acid remained little change in xz <dig> under salt stress relative to control . on the other hand, proteomic analysis showed that the protein level of pyruvate kinase  increased and protein level of citrate synthase  decreased in the shoots of xz <dig> under salt stress, but not in xz <dig>  interestingly, the response of the metabolites involved in tca cycle to salt stress differed from that observed in the cultivated barley  <cit> . accordingly, the proteins involved in amino acid synthesis showed significant up-regulation in shoots of xz <dig> under salt stress, leading to a dramatic increase in the concentration of amino acids . the increased amino acid levels may not be a directly adaptive response to salt stress, but is an indicator of general stress and cell damage  <cit> . it could be suggested that little change of metabolites in the tca cycle is associated with a better shoot growth in the tolerant genotype . while the sensitive genotypes  would increase the metabolites in tca cycle and consume more energy for its development of salt tolerance, resulting in a slower shoot growth.

CONCLUSIONS
compared with the sensitive genotype xz <dig>  xz <dig> maintained a lower na concentration in the shoots and developed superior adaptive strategies to salt stress based on the present metabolomic and proteomic studies. xz <dig> had less affected proteins in metabolic processes and catalytic activities, more stable photosynthesis and less change in sugar metabolism and other energy-consuming process for better growth than xz <dig>  these results provide useful information for understanding molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance existed in the wild species of barley.
