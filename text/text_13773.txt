BACKGROUND
plants have evolved a complex network of defense responses, often associated with a response local to the site of infection  <cit> . in addition, defenses are also systemically induced in remote parts of the plant in a process known as systemic acquired resistance   <cit> . induction of the sar pathway leads to heightened broad-spectrum resistance to secondary pathogen attacks by a variety of pathogens. multiple studies in both monocots and dicots have shown that salicylic acid  plays a central role as a signaling molecule in sar  <cit> . following pathogen attack, sa levels increase both locally and systemically in infected plants. in addition, sa is required for the induced expression of a set of pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit> .

npr <dig> was originally identified by screening for mutants that were insensitive to sa  or benzothiadiazole ) in arabidopsis  <cit> . these screens identified a mutation designated as non-expressor of pr <dig> . studies that followed further documented that npr <dig> mutants displayed reduced expression of pr genes upon sa treatment and were more susceptible to pathogens  <cit> . conversely, when npr <dig> was overexpressed, the resulting transgenic plants displayed increased resistance to pathogens, and were able to induce increased levels of pr genes in a dose-dependent fashion  <cit> .

npr <dig> encodes a protein containing ankyrin repeats and a btb/poz domain, both of which mediate protein-protein interactions in animals  <cit> . npr <dig> shares homology with iκbα transcription inhibitors, which regulate the innate immunity response  <cit> . recent work has shed light onto the mechanisms of npr <dig> function  <cit> . npr <dig> is constitutively expressed, and npr <dig> protein is present as inactive oligomers in the cytoplasm of the cell. upon sar induction, the redox state of the cell is altered, resulting in the reduction of npr <dig> to its active monomeric form. monomeric npr <dig> moves into the nucleus where it can affect the induction of pr genes. although npr <dig> itself has no dna binding domains, it participates in the regulation of defense gene transcription via interactions with tga transcription factors  <cit> . in arabidopsis, two conserved cysteine residues  have been shown to be essential to the oligomerization and cytoplasmic localization of atnpr <dig>  <cit> . mutation of these residues results in constitutive monomerization and nuclear localization of npr <dig> 

it is believed that npr <dig> also plays a role in the jasmonic acid  signaling pathway and mediates the crosstalk between sa-ja defense pathways to fine-tune defense responses  <cit> . sa-mediated defenses are mainly effective against biotrophic pathogens, whereas ja-mediated defenses are predominantly efficient against necrotrophic pathogens and herbivorous insects. npr <dig> mediates the antagonistic effect of sa on ja signaling by suppressing the expression of ja-responsive genes upon combined treatment of sa and methyl jasmonate   <cit> .

a growing body of evidence has revealed that the salicylic acid dependent, npr1-mediated defense pathway is also conserved in other plant species across wide phylogenetic distances. two npr1-like genes have been characterized from vitis vinifera   <cit> . when translational fusions of the proteins encoded by the two genes with gfp were transiently expressed in nicotiana benthamiana leaves, the proteins were localized predominantly to the nucleus and triggered the accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins pr <dig> and pr <dig>  in addition, the silencing of a tomato npr1-like gene leads to increased bacterial growth upon ralstonia solanacearum infection in tomato  <cit> . in tobacco, the suppression of npr1-like gene leads to increased susceptibility to tobacco mosaic virus  <cit> . similarly, overexpression of the apple mpnpr <dig> gene in transgenic apple plants resulted in the up-regulation of pr genes and enhanced resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens  <cit> . in wheat, the expression of arabidopsis npr <dig> confers resistance to fusarium head blight in susceptible cultivar bobwhite  <cit> . major efforts have been made to study the sa and npr1-dependent pathway in rice, the model monocot plant. treatment of rice plants with the salicylic acid analog probenazole results in enhanced resistance against rice blast fungus  <cit> . in addition, rice plants expressing bacterial salicylate hydrolase  are unable to accumulate salicylic acid and display increased susceptibility to rice blast  <cit> . overexpression of the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene in rice leads to enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> . an orthologue of npr <dig> has been isolated from rice , and the overexpression of osnpr <dig> in rice leads to enhanced resistance to both bacterial and oomycete pathogens  <cit> . moreover, osnpr <dig> is able to complement the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant  <cit> . like atnpr <dig>  osnpr <dig> is also constitutively expressed and localizes to the cytoplasm. treatment of rice cells with a reducing agent resulted in the movement of osnpr <dig> into the nucleus. similar to arabidopsis npr <dig>  mutation of the corresponding cysteines  in osnpr <dig> also resulted in constitutive nuclear localization  <cit> . thus, it appears that the mechanisms of sa-dependent, npr1-mediated defense response likely evolved very early in the emergence of the plant kingdom.

theobroma cacao l,  is a small tropical tree species endemic to the amazon rainforest of south america. cacao seeds are harvested and processed into cocoa beans and chocolate, providing an income for millions of small-holder farmers in west africa, central and south america, the caribbean, malaysia, indonesia and other tropical areas. pathogens are a major problem for cacao production, causing annual crop losses estimated at 30-40%  <cit> . in its center of diversity, the amazon basin, cacao is susceptible to several potentially devastating pathogens, such as moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of witches' broom disease, moniliophthora roreri, the causal agent of frosty pod rot  <cit>  and several phytophthora spp., the causal agent of black pod disease  <cit> . outside this region, cacao is susceptible to a number of opportunistic pathogens  <cit> .

several defense-related genes in theobroma cacao have been identified through gene expression analyses after hormone treatments  <cit> . an endo- <dig> -β-glucanase is induced by the application of ethylene, and a type iii peroxidase and a class vii chitinase are induced by methyl jasmonate treatment in mature cacao leaves. those genes are responsible for induced resistance to pests in cacao, though the responses to hormone induction are different depending on developmental stages. in addition, transgenic overexpression of a class i chitinase gene in cacao enhances foliar resistance against the fungal pathogen, colletotrichum gloeosporioides  <cit> . moreover, ests sharing sequence homology to known pr genes have been isolated from cacao  <cit> . several of these genes have been shown to be up-regulated by treatment of plants with benzothiadiazole , the salicylic acid analog  <cit> . all together, recent evidence suggests that cacao may utilize sar pathway during the defense response; however, the extent of conservation of the pathway in cacao is presently unknown.

in this paper, we report the isolation and characterization of an npr <dig> homologue from the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. we show that theobroma cacao npr <dig>  shares similar functions as arabidopsis npr <dig>  it is able to partially complement the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutation in transgenic arabidopsis plants in a leaf infection assay and translocate into nucleus upon sa induction in the same manner as the endogenous arabidopsis npr <dig> protein.

RESULTS
isolation of a putative tcnpr <dig> gene
degenerate pcr was utilized to clone the full length cdna of theobroma cacao npr <dig> . the degenerate primers were designed based on the alignment of npr <dig> homologs from arabidopsis, brassica and carica papaya and cdna from cacao genotype scavina <dig>  leaf was used as template. a fragment of  <dig> bp was isolated, cloned into pgem sequencing vector and sequenced to reveal an intact coding sequence of the expected length and with high homology to the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene.

a genomic fragment containing a putative tcnpr <dig> gene was obtained by screening clemson university genomics institute  cacao bac library using the putative cacao tcnpr <dig> cdna clone as probe. two bac clones were found to contain the tcnpr <dig> gene: 2k <dig> and 11k <dig>  the genomic sequence of tcnpr <dig> was isolated by primer walking sequencing from known sequence using clone 2k <dig>  a similar strategy was performed to sequence a region of  <dig>  kb containing the promoter sequence upstream of atg start codon. the full sequence consisted of a  <dig>  kb genomic region of tcnpr <dig> containing  <dig>  kb promoter, four exons and three introns , which is similar to the genomic structure of atnpr <dig> 

arabidopsis and cacao npr <dig> protein sequences are highly similar
conceptual translation of the cacao npr <dig> protein revealed that it consists of  <dig> amino acid residues, only two amino acids shorter than atnpr <dig>  alignment of the atnpr <dig> and tcnpr <dig> protein sequences revealed that they are highly similar to each other . both the arabidopsis and cacao npr <dig> genes encode predicted proteins that share a number of structural features . each has a btb/poz domain near its n-terminal end  which shares 65% identity. similarly, an ankyrin repeat region  is present in both proteins which shares about 72% identity. in other ankyrin containing proteins, these domains have been shown to play roles in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in the atnpr <dig> protein, the btb/poz domain has been shown to function in homo-dimerization of npr <dig>  and the ankyrin repeat region mediates interactions with tga transcription factors  <cit> . in addition, two cysteine residues , which have been shown to play a role in the redox regulated activation and nuclear localization  <cit> , are also conserved in tcnpr <dig> . in fact, the atnpr <dig> and tcnpr <dig> proteins share eleven conserved cysteine residues, suggesting that they share a similar structural conformation. the c-terminal region of atnpr <dig> has been shown to contain a nuclear localization signal  that directs npr <dig> monomers into the nucleus upon induction  <cit> . five basic amino acids in this region function directly in this role . four out of five of these basic amino acids are identical in tcnpr <dig>  suggesting that tcnpr <dig> may also contain functional nuclear localization sequences. these similarities in protein structure suggest that tcnpr <dig> gene may also share the same function as atnpr <dig> during plant defense response.

cacao npr <dig> gene promoter contains putative sa regulatory elements
we analyzed the  <dig>  kb promoter region of the tcnpr <dig> gene  using plant cis-acting regulatory elements databases place http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/place/ <cit>  and plantcare http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ <cit> . although a potential caat box was found  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of the atg start codon, we did not observe an element resembling a tata box. this is not surprising, as recent studies of core promoter regions in both plants and animals suggest that only 24%-29% of genes contain tata-like elements  <cit> . a variety of other regulatory elements were also found. several elements known to regulate inducibility by salicylic acid were found, such as the as- <dig> element . tgacg motifs were found involved in transcription activation by sa and this element was previously shown to be required for the sa-induced expression of pr <dig>  <cit> . in addition, there were multiple copies of the w-box , an element similar to the as- <dig> element, which was also found in promoter of atnpr <dig>  w-box was shown to be the binding site for sa-induced wrky dna binding proteins  <cit> , and was required for the sa induction of the tobacco  class i chitinase gene  <cit> . all of the information suggests that the tcnpr <dig> gene might be regulated by sa in a manner similar to atnpr <dig>  interestingly, several cis-elements involved in light responsiveness and circadian control are also presented in the tcnpr <dig> promoter, suggesting that tcnpr <dig> might be also regulated by light.

basal and induced expression of tcnpr <dig> in cacao tissues
semi-quantitative rt-pcr was performed to illustrate the basal expression level of tcnpr <dig> in various cacao tissues of scavina <dig>  including leaves from stage a , c , e , open flowers, unopened flowers, roots, seeds and fruit exocarps. tcnpr <dig> transcript was detected in all tissues tested , an expression pattern similar to the arabidopsis gene, however, the basal level of expression varies among different tissues. the expression of tcnpr <dig> was relatively high in the younger leaves  and lower in the later stages of development . the lowest expression of tcnpr <dig> in all tested tissue was observed in seeds whereas the expression was relatively high in fruit exocarps. in flowers, expression of tcnpr <dig> was higher in open flowers than in unopened ones. the expression of tcnpr <dig> in roots was at a moderate level, comparable to that in flowers and younger leaves.

induction by sa
since it is well-characterized that npr <dig> transcript accumulation can be increased by sa treatment of arabidopsis leaves, we tested if tcnpr <dig> can respond to exogenous sa in the same manner. we applied various concentrations of sa to stage c leaves of two genotypes, scavina <dig> and ics <dig>  which differ in their resistance to witches' broom disease   <cit> . in arabidopsis, the npr <dig> gene is induced approximately 2- <dig> fold  <dig> hrs after treatment of leaves with  <dig> mm sa  <cit> . semi-quantitative rt-pcr was employed to demonstrate the induced level of tcnpr <dig>  <dig> hours after sa application . to quantify the expression of tcnpr <dig> after sa treatment, we measured the fluorescence intensity of ethidium bromide stained dna fragments irradiated with uv light using a high-sensitivity camera and imagequant software. data were normalized to the expression level of an actin control. the results presented in figure 2b showed that there was no significant change of tcnpr <dig> expression upon  <dig> mm,  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm sa treatment in ics <dig> compared to water control. however, in the scavina <dig>  there was a statistically-significant 2-fold increase of tcnpr <dig> at  <dig> mm sa induction, though there was no change upon  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm sa treatment.

complementation of arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant
to assess the function of tcnpr <dig>  we placed the cacao tcnpr <dig> gene under the control of the e- <dig> omega promoter and introduced it into the arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant to test if it can restore the mutant phenotype. one of the well characterized phenotypes of this mutant is the lack of sa-dependent activation of the pr <dig> gene  <cit> . the pr <dig> gene is thought to encode a protein active in defense response and has been used as a marker of sa pathway activation in many studies and in different plant species.

five independent tcnpr <dig> transgenic lines, wild type arabidopsis col- <dig> along with the npr1- <dig> mutant were sprayed with  <dig> mm sa, and the expression of tcnpr <dig> and atpr <dig> was determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr  <dig> hr after induction. five transgenic lines all showed heterologous tcnpr <dig> expression with varied expression levels . as expected, there was no significant up-regulation of the transgene after sa treatment because tcnpr <dig> was expressed constitutively from the e12-Ω promoter. the arabidopsis pr <dig> gene showed a very large induction after sa treatment in wild type arabidopsis col- <dig> , but there was no up regulation in the npr1- <dig> mutant, which is consistent with previous report  <cit> . there was a small increase in pr <dig> expression in the mutant treated with water, which could be expected from plant to plant biological variation. however, the pr <dig> gene expression level did not change after sa treatment, as expected for the npr1- <dig> mutant. we observed a moderate induction of the pr <dig> gene in  <dig> out of  <dig> transgenic lines , though the level of induction was not as high as in wild type col- <dig>  no pr <dig> gene induction was observed for transgenic lines  <dig> and  <dig>  these results suggest that the tcnpr <dig> gene can at least partially complement the arabidopsis npr1mutant and act to mediate sa dependent pr <dig> gene expression in arabidopsis leaves but it may not act as efficiently as the endogenous npr <dig> itself.

another phenotype of the arabidopsis npr <dig> mutation is increased pathogen growth after bacterial infection of leaves  <cit> . to test if tcnpr <dig> overexpression in npr1- <dig> mutant can complement the mutant disease susceptible phenotype, we infected leaves from  <dig> transgenic lines with pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  by syringe infiltration. the results indicated that the npr1- <dig> mutant was more susceptible than col- <dig>  three days after inoculation, exhibiting yellow necrosis similar to previous results  <cit> . three transgenic lines overexpressing the tcnpr <dig> gene and exhibiting sa dependent pr <dig> up-regulation partially restored induced resistance compared to the control npr1- <dig> mutant . although several yellow necrotic spots were displayed on leaves of the transgenic plants, they did not exhibit severe necrosis or senescence. however, the other two transgenic lines, line  <dig> and  <dig>  showed necrosis all over the leaves and the tissues were wilted. water infiltration served as a control to demonstrate that the injection of water alone did not damage the tissues.

to quantify the disease symptom, bacterial assays were carried out to measure the titer of bacterial on infected leaves. the levels of bacterial in infected npr1- <dig> mutant leaf disks increased more than  <dig> fold as compared to col- <dig> controls . the three transgenic lines overexpressing the tcnpr <dig> gene , which exhibited significant up-regulation of the pr <dig> after sa treatment, showed a  <dig> to  <dig> fold reduction of bacterial growth compared to the npr1- <dig> mutant. there was no significant change in bacterial growth rates in leaf disks of the other two transgenic lines tested . to assess the relationship between the level of sa-dependent induction of pr <dig> and the degree of bacterial growth in the transgenic lines, we plotted the values as depicted in figure 4c. a significant negative correlation between sa dependent gene induction and bacterial growth was observed , suggesting that the resistance conferred by tcnpr <dig> is via the sa dependent resistance pathway and further supports our hypothesis that tcnpr <dig> plays a similar function to arabidopsis npr <dig> in plant defense response.

nuclear translocation of tcnpr <dig> after sa induction
another hallmark of atnpr <dig> function is its nuclear localization in response to treatment with sa  <cit> . to determine if tcnpr <dig> can also translocate into the nucleus in response to sa in a manner similar to arabidopsis npr <dig>  we created transgenic arabidopsis plants containing a tcnpr1-egfp translational fusion and observed the subcellular localization of the fusion protein using confocal microscopy . this construct  was stably transformed into the npr1- <dig> mutant and we observed the localization of egfp fusion protein before and  <dig> hrs after sa treatment in both leaf and root cells of four independent transgenic lines. we observed no egfp fluorescence in negative control plants transformed with the identical vector lacking the tcnpr1-egfp fusion gene . as an additional control, transgenic plants overexpressing egfp without a fusion to tcnpr <dig> were imaged, and we observed strong fluorescence in both cytoplasm and nucleus with no localization changes after sa treatment. a final control consisted of a construct designed for the overexpression of the arabidopsis npr <dig> protein translationally fused to egfp . consistent with the findings of others  <cit> , we observed an extremely strong nuclear translocation of the fusion protein in leaf guard cells and in root cells  <dig> hrs after sa treatment.

the tcnpr1-egfp fusion protein appeared to be evenly distributed in cytoplasm of leaf guard cells from water-treated 4-week-old soil grown plants, however, the protein accumulated moderately in guard cell nucleus  <dig> hours after sa application . similarly, a modest level of nuclear translocation could also be observed in the root cells from 10-day-old seedlings grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig>  mm sa . although protein translocation of tcnpr <dig> is of lesser extent than observed with the arabidopsis npr1-egfp protein based on reduced nuclear fluorescence observed in tcnpr1-egfp transgenic plants, our results taken together indicate that tcnpr <dig>  like arabidopsis npr <dig>  can translocate into nucleus after sa induction and participate in the induction of defense related gene expression.

tcnpr <dig> and sa-ja crosstalk
it has been previously demonstrated that arabidopsis npr <dig> can mediate the antagonism between sa and jasmonic acid  by suppressing ja-responsive genes  <cit> , suggesting that it plays an important role in fine tuning the cross-talk between different regulatory pathways. to explore the role of tcnpr <dig> in cross-talk, we tested the effect of sa and ja treatments on defense gene expression in wild type col- <dig>  npr1- <dig> mutant and five independent 35s:tcnpr <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines. semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed that all five lines carrying the cacao transgene expressed tcnpr <dig> at moderate levels, and these did not change much during hormone treatments . exogenous application of  <dig> mm sa activated pr <dig> in col- <dig> and three transgenic lines, but not in npr1- <dig> mutant. additionally,  <dig> hrs after treatment with  <dig>  mm methyl jasmonate  in  <dig> % silwet l- <dig>  two well established meja inducible genes  were up-regulated in wild-type plant and in npr1- <dig> mutant, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . two dna bands were detected in some of the pdf <dig>  pcr products, and we determined that the smaller molecular weight band resulted from cdna amplification and the large fragment resulted from amplification of genomic dna . as predicted, all five 35s:tcnpr <dig> transgenic lines exhibited levels of increased vsp <dig> and pdf <dig>  that were similar to those seen in col- <dig> plants. upon treatment with a combination of  <dig> mm sa and  <dig>  mm meja in  <dig> % silwet l- <dig>  pr <dig> was expressed at a level similar to seen when plants were treated with sa alone, indicating that meja had no effects on sa-responsive pr <dig> expression. both vsp <dig> and pdf <dig>  expressed at significantly lower levels in col- <dig> compared to that in npr1- <dig> mutant after sa and meja combined treatment, demonstrating the function of atnpr <dig> in antagonistic repression of ja-responsive genes. all five transgenic lines containing tcnpr <dig> gene displayed reduced expression levels of ja-responsive gene expression upon sa and ja combined treatment compared to npr1- <dig> mutant, suggesting that tcnpr <dig> can also mediate sa-ja cross-talk in a manner similar to atnpr <dig> 

to quantify the expression of vsp <dig> and pdf <dig>  after the treatment of the combination of sa and meja, we measured the band intensity as above . the data was normalized to an ubiquitin control for loading effects. the relative expression levels of vsp <dig> and pdf <dig>  were significantly decreased in tcnpr <dig> expressing transgenic lines compared to npr1- <dig> mutant , a pattern similar to wild-type col- <dig>  suggesting that tcnpr <dig> restored the npr <dig> phenotype. these data support our hypothesis that tcnpr <dig> may play a role in mediating sa-ja cross talk as does arabidopsis npr <dig> 

discussion
we have isolated an npr <dig> homologous gene from the tropical tree, theobroma cacao, and have generated transgenic arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant lines overexpressing tcnpr <dig>  all of our results are consistent with the hypothesis that tcnpr <dig> is a functional orthologue of the well characterized arabidopsis gene. tcnpr <dig> complemented each of the major arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant phenotypes that were tested. over-expression of tcnpr <dig> in the npr1- <dig> mutant conferred pr <dig> up-regulation after sa treatment and increased resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> . tcnpr <dig> was shown to be translocated into the nucleus in response to sa and to participate in sa-ja cross talk regulation . in our data, we found that transgenic lines  <dig> line exhibited reduced complementation in sa-induced pr <dig> expression and disease resistance , while at the same time same two lines efficiently mediated crosstalk between sa and ja . in previous studies, the activation of defense related genes was shown to involve the nuclear translocation of npr <dig>  <cit>  while the crosstalk between sa and ja signaling was shown to be mediated by cytosolic npr <dig>  <cit> , thus it appears that very different mechanisms exist for these two functions of npr <dig>  the differential efficiencies of complementation of tcnpr <dig> we observed may reflect these different mechanisms. it is well known that positional effects  can have a large effect on protein expression levels. as suggested by rna expression levels of the different tcnpr <dig> expressing transgenic lines , lines  <dig> and  <dig> may have lower protein expression than lines 2- <dig>  it seems plausible that the differential complementation of the two npr <dig> functions resulted from the differences in expression levels, potentially as a result of different protein accumulation levels in the cytosol vs nuclear compartments. consistent with this idea, only the higher levels of expression seen in lines 2- <dig> was sufficient to complement the nuclear gene induction function, but the levels of expression were high enough in all lines to complement the cytosolic sa/ja crosstalk function.

in all, our results demonstrate a high degree of evolutionary and functional conservation of npr <dig> from the brassicales to the malvales. npr <dig> is also conserved in species as diverse as grapevine  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , apple  <cit> , banana  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , tobacco  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . this high degree of functional conservation suggests that npr <dig> function evolved very early in the development of higher plants and that it plays a very critical role in plant development and reproductive success.

little is known about the mechanisms of defense signaling in cacao. our data suggests that the central mechanisms operative in arabidopsis are likely to be conserved in cacao. at a minimum, our data suggests that the mechanisms and molecules that interact with npr <dig> during sa and ja signaling and nuclear translocation are also conserved in cacao. if this were not the case, we would not expect the cacao npr <dig> protein to function normally in arabidopsis. however, the cacao protein in some cases only partially restored function of the npr <dig> mutant, which is likely the result of transgene expression level differences compared to the endogenous gene and/or partial molecular incompatibility with its interacting protein partners. it is possible that the binding affinities between the cacao npr1-interacting proteins are reduced as compared to the endogenous arabidopsis coevolved partners. partial complementation has commonly been observed in heterologous complementation analysis in many other systems  <cit> .

further investigation is needed to explore the entire defense response pathway in theobroma cacao and to understand the similarities and differences with arabidopsis overall. for example, our expression data shows that tcnpr <dig> can be up-regulated only at  <dig> mm sa treatment but not at lower concentrations, which is higher than the optimal level of  <dig> mm in arabidopsis as previously indicated  <cit> . it would be interesting to test the endogenous sa level of cacao and to determine dose response dynamics in various tissues and during different stages of development. another area of interest is to identify and characterize the downstream targets of tcnpr <dig> and to compare them to the approximately  <dig>  genes that are regulated by npr <dig> during systemic acquired resistance in arabidopsis  <cit> . surveying these genes in cacao could reveal interesting differences in the defense responses unique to this tropical tree relative to arabidopsis. furthermore, arabidopsis npr <dig> has been shown to interact with several different proteins such as the tga transcription factors  <cit> . thus another area of interest is to isolate tcnpr <dig> interacting cacao proteins, which will further enhance our knowledge of this pathway in cacao. we are also interested in studying other npr1-like genes of cacao and the recent completion of a draft cacao genome sequence has led to the identification of three additional npr1-like cacao genes  <cit> .

plant diseases, especially pathogenic fungi, are estimated to cause about 30-40% yield loss on cacao annually  <cit> , and thus disease resistance is of substantial interest to cacao breeders. our findings can be utilized in several approaches to help develop varieties of cacao with enhanced disease resistance. the sequence of the tcnpr <dig> gene could possibly be used to develop molecular markers and probes that can be employed to select disease resistant varieties with specific allelic variations. interestingly, the major quantitative trait locus  for witches' broom disease resistance is tightly linked to the tcnpr <dig> gene  <cit> , thus the tcnpr <dig> gene serves as a key candidate gene for generation of molecular markers that can be used for marker assisted selection of new disease resistant varieties. in addition, tcnpr <dig> expression levels could be modified in transgenic cacao varieties to develop broad-spectrum disease resistance. this approach has already been successful in several species but to our knowledge, has not yet been deployed in commercial production for any species. however, consumer and industry reluctance to accept transgenic plant technology remains a formidable barrier to development of any transgenic cacao varieties for commercialization.

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation of the tcnpr <dig> gene and its heterologous complementation in arabidopsis allowed us to rapidly characterize the function of this defense-related gene. the up-regulation of pr <dig> and increased bacterial resistance in transgenic arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutants strongly supported that tcnpr <dig> is a functional ortholog of arabidopsis npr <dig>  and vital component in sa-dependent signaling pathway in theobroma cacao. our results provide potential opportunities to enhance disease resistance in this crop species through conventional breeding or biotechnological approaches. further investigation is needed to identify the tcnpr <dig> interacting transcription factors and their downstream targets in cacao and to reveal further details of the molecular mechanisms of the role tcnpr <dig> plays as a central mediator of the plant defense response.
