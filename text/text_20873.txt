BACKGROUND
atlantic salmon  is a species of great economic, environmental and scientific importance, with a worldwide production of approximately  <dig>  million tonnes per annum  <cit> . atlantic salmon is also considered a model species for the other members of the salmonidae family and as such is the target of an on-going genome sequencing and assembly project  <cit> . this genome sequence and its interrogation will be important for understanding the genetic regulation of complex traits in salmonids, with applications for improvement of aquaculture breeding programs and for population and evolutionary genetics studies. however, unlike major terrestrial farmed species, a high-throughput high-density genotyping array is not yet available for screening genome-wide polymorphic variation in atlantic salmon. an existing low-density single nucleotide polymorphism  array contains approximately  <dig> k polymorphic snps  <cit> .

the genetic improvement of atlantic salmon through selective breeding programs began in the early 1970s in norway  <cit>  and, despite a  <dig> -  <dig> year generation interval, has resulted in rapid improvement of economically-important traits such as growth, sexual maturation and disease resistance  <cit> . microsatellite and snp marker resources have been developed and applied in breeding programs for parentage assignment  <cit>  and quantitative trait loci  detection with subsequent marker-assisted selection for favourable alleles, particularly for increased disease resistance . snps are increasingly applied as the marker of choice for genetic studies due to their abundance, ease of discovery and low cost of genotyping per locus, especially using snp chips which simultaneously assay tens of thousands of snps per sample. genotyping-by-sequencing approaches such as restriction site-associated dna  sequencing  <cit>  are increasingly utilised to simultaneously discover and genotype thousands of snps in salmonid species with applications for genome characterisation, population genomics and qtl mapping  <cit> . additionally, the existing  <dig> k snp array  <cit>  has been applied for mapping qtl  <cit>  and differentiating between populations  <cit> .

the snp density offered by either the existing snp array or rad sequencing approaches to date is not sufficient to capture population-wide linkage disequilibrium to enable fully effective genome-wide association studies   <cit> . further, dense genome-wide snp data can also be included in breeding programs alongside extensive phenotype and pedigree information to increase the accuracy of selection for key traits using genomic selection  <cit> . genomic selection has the potential to dramatically increase selection accuracy, genetic gain and reduce inbreeding in atlantic salmon breeding programs  <cit> . genotyping tools used for gwas and genomic selection in terrestrial species with genomes of comparable size to atlantic salmon contain between ~ <dig> k to ~ <dig> k snps  <cit> , highlighting the need for a denser atlantic salmon genotyping platform.

salmonids such as atlantic salmon are descended from a teleost lineage which has undergone a whole genome duplication event approximately  <dig> -  <dig> million years ago and are thought to be in the process of reverting to a diploid state  <cit> . this genome duplication complicates the discovery of genuine bi-allelic snps as it can be difficult in bioinformatics analyses to distinguish variation between paralogous loci from genuine snp variation at unique genome locations . high-throughput sequencing technologies now make large scale snp discovery in salmonids attainable , subject to high sequence coverage of both alleles. full genome re-sequencing for salmonid snp discovery remains expensive and genome complexity reduction techniques such as reduced-representation sequencing , rad sequencing  and rna sequencing  have all been successfully applied for this purpose .

the aim of the current study was to develop a high-density snp genotyping array for atlantic salmon and to validate these snps and the array by genotyping samples from several populations of farmed and wild fish. due to the complexities of the atlantic salmon genome, a multi-faceted approach to snp discovery was applied using a combination of rr-seq, rad-seq and rna-seq alongside several strategies for exclusion of paralogous sequence variants  including rr-seq of haploid material. this manuscript describes the creation and testing of the snp array and highlights its potential applications in atlantic salmon genetics research.

RESULTS
sequencing and snp discovery
to generate candidate snps for inclusion on an affymetrix axiom® mydesign custom array  three main illumina – based sequencing strategies were applied; rr-seq , rad-seq  and rna-seq . snps were discovered in representative samples of the atlantic salmon breeding company landcatch natural selection ltd  while the rr-seq also included a pool of wild fish from diverse geographical sources and a single haploid atlantic salmon embryo for the purpose of psv exclusion .

snp selection and filtering
alignment of the illumina sequence data to the draft atlantic salmon reference genome assembly  identified  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   putative variable snp positions. following the quality-control filtering of these putative snps ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   candidate snps remained for potential inclusion on the ‘ssalar01’ array. in addition to the newly-discovered candidate snps, a number of predominantly public domain, mapped snps  were also included. all candidate snps  were submitted to affymetrix for in silico prediction of their probability of conversion to a reliable assay on the axiom array . following application of filtering criteria incorporating the p-convert score  the final array contained  <dig>  putative snps assayed by  <dig>  probes. of the snp on the array,  <dig>  were detected in more than one of the snp discovery categories .

performance of snps on the array
the ssalar <dig> array was used to genotype  <dig> atlantic salmon samples of diverse origin from three main categories; farmed scottish ; farmed norwegian ; and wild fish  . following assessment of the cluster properties of each of the snps, a total of  <dig>  snps were designated as high quality and polymorphic. the main reason for discarding snps at this stage was the high rate of monomorphism, with  <dig>  snps designated as monomorphic in these  <dig> dna samples . given that the samples contained either the same or closely-related samples to the snp discovery populations, it is unlikely that there would be a failure to observe the minor allele of a genuine snp. following a final filtering stage based on exclusion of any genotyped snps showing an apparent mendelian error in the pedigreed samples, the final set of  <dig>  qc-filtered snps were used for further analysis .

*the row total is lower than sum of the individual column totals because a proportion of these snps were from multiple categories ; see additional file 1: table s <dig> 

**‘quality’ refers to the cluster properties of the snp when genotyped on the axiom array. low quality snps are those with cluster properties that fall below a threshold value .

the number of snps in the final qc-filtered dataset has a relatively even distribution across the three main snp discovery techniques . by comparison, the majority of candidate snps provided to affymetrix were derived from rna-seq, reflecting the high discrepancy between candidate and verified rna-seq-derived snps . while rna-seq has been successfully applied to detect qtl-associated snps in salmonids  <cit> , the technique is purported to be particularly susceptible to false positive snp discovery even in species with well-characterised reference genomes . interestingly, the rad-seq-derived snps showed a much higher discrepancy between candidate and verified snps  than rr-seq . this may be due to the more effective removal of putative paralogous variants discovered via the rr-seq of the haploid fish. it is also worth noting that 23% of the previously published snps were not verified in our sample, despite the fact that these snps have previously been verified through genotyping and linkage mapping experiments . this may partly reflect the different origins of the samples used in the current study and/or limitations in the genotyping technology.

a disparity between the number of putative dna-sequencing-derived snps and the number of validated snps has been a feature of snp discovery studies, particularly in salmonid species . one of the possible reasons for the apparently large number of false positive snps discovered in these sequencing experiments is the duplicated nature of the atlantic salmon genome due to the whole genome duplication event approximately  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . although analyses were performed to remove putative paralogous variants in the current study via exclusion of haploid-derived heterozygous putative snps  and snps showing mendelian errors in pedigreed samples , it is likely that a significant proportion would remain. this is particularly the case in the rna-seq dataset where these quality control measures were not possible. several other possible reasons for false positives could include sequencing errors and unknown  repeat elements; the atlantic salmon genome is known to contain very frequent, long and similar repeats  <cit> .

the duplicated genome also had to be accounted for when clustering the genotypes on the axiom array. probes designed to detect snp alleles in a single genome location can often also detect paralogous alleles which gives rise to multi-site variants . msvs therefore have four alleles rather than two and the clustering algorithm must distinguish between these categories. for example, in the case where the snp  segregates in one paralogue and the other paralogue is fixed for a/a then the three possible bi-locus genotypes are aaaa, aaab and aabb. these cluster patterns are evident from graphs of the clusters observed within the polymorphic high resolution category of snps. the affymetrix axiomgtv <dig> algorithm  was applied to adapt pre-positioned clusters to the data using a bayesian approach . the adaptability of this algorithm will facilitate accurate genotyping of other populations, and potentially other salmonid species, which may have dissimilar msv structures.

finally, it is noteworthy that in the final set of qc-filtered snps, at least 38%  are from transcribed regions of atlantic salmon genome  and therefore more likely to be functional, and this putative enrichment is advantageous for determining the genetic architecture of traits of economic or environmental importance and for comparative mapping between salmonids and more distantly-related species.

population segregation of snps
the segregation of the filtered snps in the samples from distinct populations of atlantic salmon was evaluated. in the case where family samples were included, only the  parental fish were included in the analysis . the filtered snps are highly polymorphic in all three groups, with ~ <dig> k,  <dig> k and  <dig> k snps had a maf higher than  <dig>  in the farmed scottish, farmed norwegian and wild fish respectively . over  <dig> k snps had a maf over  <dig>  in all three groups with only a small percentage of snps being polymorphic in one group only . the largest number of population-specific segregating snps were detected in the farmed scottish group with ~8k snps observed exclusively in this population. this is likely to be due to the fact that this population made up most of the snp discovery panel for all three sequencing experiments, and that the farmed scottish group were most highly represented in the validation population giving a higher likelihood of detecting rare minor alleles . to support this theory, the average maf of the snps specific to the farmed scottish population was  <dig> ; whereas the overall average maf for the farmed scottish population was  <dig>  . across all genotyped samples and all snps the average maf was  <dig> , and the snps were evenly distributed in maf bins ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  .

*note that only unrelated animals from each population were included; i.e. the offspring from trios  or linkage mapping families  were removed. the full list of animals is given in additional file  <dig> 

genomic distribution of snps
the atlantic salmon genome is currently being sequenced and assembled  <cit>  and the first draft publicly available assembly consists of ~ <dig>  gigabases of sequence data assembled into ~ <dig>  contigs with a contig n <dig> of  <dig>  kb . the distribution of the ssalar <dig> array qc-filtered snps across the reference genome contigs was investigated. approximately  <dig> k contigs contained one or more snps with the majority of those  containing only one snp. only 3% of the snp-containing contigs contained six or more snps . the total length of the snp-containing contigs was ~ <dig> mb which is approximately one third of the total assembled genome sequence. while these contigs have largely yet to be assigned to chromosomes, this indicates that the snps are most likely spread over a large proportion of the atlantic salmon genome, as confirmed by the linkage mapping results given below. the average spacing between qc-filtered snps was ~ <dig> kb based on the entire reference genome assembly  and ~ <dig> kb based on the total length of the genome contigs that contained a snp . as expected, the number of snps on a genome contig was related to the contig length with longer contigs more likely to harbour multiple snps .

recombination is greatly repressed in large sections of the genome of male salmonids compared to females, with large sections of the chromosomes proximal to the centromere showing close to zero recombination  <cit> . as a result, large haplotypes of marker alleles are inherited from sires to offspring as a single chromosomal unit  <cit> . this phenomenon was exploited to map a proportion of the sire-heterozygous snps in the two salmap reference families br <dig> and br <dig>  <cit>   to a putative linkage group and therefore chromosome. in all,  <dig>  qc-filtered snps had the segregation pattern ab  ×   in at least one of the families. genotypes at anchor markers from each chromosome were included  and the clustering of markers to putative linkage groups was performed using crimap v <dig>   <cit>  as modified by xuelu liu . a total of  <dig>   sire-segregating snps were mapped to an atlantic salmon chromosome  which, given the small size of the mapping panel, highlights the widespread lack of male recombination. all chromosomes had good snp coverage, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  snps per chromosome , which is substantially higher than any published atlantic salmon linkage map. the number of snps per chromosome showed a high positive correlation  with the snp linkage map of lien et al.  <cit>  which was created by an independent group, using different snp discovery techniques and genetic material. therefore, it is likely that the number of snps discovered on each chromosome in both studies is correlated with chromosome size. these results are indicative of the validity of the chromosome assignment for the snps, and suggestive of their genome-wide distribution.

identity-by-state clustering and multidimensional scaling
dense genome-wide snp data can be used to estimate the overall similarity of the genomes of any two samples by calculating average measures of identity-by-state  of the marker loci. this analysis can be useful for detecting population structure in genetics studies; e.g. to detect and account for population stratification in gwas or to differentiate the origin of individuals in a mixed-population sample. to evaluate the utility of the ‘ssalar01’ array to detect population structure, an n × n matrix of genome-wide ibs pairwise distances was calculated for all unrelated genotyped samples and classical multidimensional scaling of the data was applied using plink  <cit> . a scatterplot of the individuals on the first two dimensions clearly reveals the clustering of samples according to their origin with distinct groups for the farmed scottish population, the two farmed norwegian populations and the diverse samples of wild fish . the number of fish included per population was relatively small, particularly for the wild samples, and genotyping additional unrelated samples from each of these  populations would be advantageous to fully evaluate the utility of the array to detect population structure.

predicting phenotypic sex using y-specific probes
apart from sexually mature individuals, identification of phenotypic sex in salmonids requires dissection of the body cavity and, in the case of juveniles, microscopic examination of gonadal tissue. the sex determining system of salmonids is primarily male heterogametic . a y-specific master sex-determining gene  was recently described in rainbow trout  <cit> , with homologues identified in other salmonid species  <cit> . to enable the sex of the atlantic salmon genotyped on the snp array to be inferred, partial sequence of the atlantic salmon sdy gene  was used to design a set of  <dig> putative y specific probes  while were placed on the array. the mean intensity values for these probes showed a clear clustering of the  <dig> genotyped samples into two groups  and, for  <dig> of the samples where phenotypic sex was known, there was a 100% concordance with the predicted sex given by the y-specific probes . these results provide evidence that the same sex-determining locus acts in these atlantic salmon populations as in rainbow trout, and that the ssalar <dig> array incorporates an accurate molecular genetic test for this male specific fragment, allowing robust inference of phenotypic sex in farmed and wild atlantic salmon.

CONCLUSIONS
this manuscript describes the creation and analysis of the first high-density  snp array for atlantic salmon. the three major snp discovery techniques  all proved successful in discovering tens of thousands of high quality polymorphic snps in the atlantic salmon genome. linkage mapping and integration with the draft reference genome sequence suggests the snps are distributed widely over all chromosomes. this affymetrix axiom snp array will be publicly available from march  <dig> and will facilitate high-resolution studies to determine the genetic architecture of traits of economic and ecological importance, to study the structure of atlantic salmon populations and to apply genomic selection in breeding programs.
