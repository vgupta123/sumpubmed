BACKGROUND
drought is one of the most serious abiotic stress factors which occur throughout the development of the plant and, if sufficiently severe and/or prolonged, results in the modification of the plant's physiology and severely limit crop productivity. plants have evolved a range of defence and escape mechanisms  <cit> , and these are typically mediated by multiple rather than by single genes. in barley, qtl underlying drought tolerance has been mapped to almost every chromosome  <cit> . however, little information has been gathered to date regarding the genomic location of drought-regulated genes, either expressed throughout plant development or at late reproductive stages influencing seed yield and quality.

of all the genetic marker types available, single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant, and thus offer the greatest level of genetic resolution. they are of potential functional relevance and they are also well suited to high throughput analytical methods  <cit> . the representation of snps on the barley linkage map has grown over recent years  <cit> , and in particular, a snp-based map featuring gene sequences expressed differentially in response to various abiotic stresses has recently been developed  <cit> . here we present a snp-based genetic map of barley, specifically focussing on nucleotide variation in ests demonstrated to be involved in the response of barley to drought stress occurring at early vegetative stages, during anthesis and the grain filling process.

while the productivity of the cereals has risen greatly since their domestication, in response to farmer selection and methodical breeding, there are indications that the increasing fixation of elite alleles in modern breeding germplasm is already inhibiting further genetic gain. in the face of potential climate change, these elite allele combinations may become sub-optimal and will necessitate a search for better adapted alleles among crop landraces or wild materials  <cit> . population of wild barley  have been shown to possess favourable genetic variation for a number of agronomic traits  <cit>  including biotic  <cit>  and abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> .

we report haplotyping data for  <dig> starch biosynthesis/degradation genes demonstrating the broad diversity among h. spontaneum accessions and h. vulgare landraces but rather limited genetic variance in the current elite breeding germplasm by fixing certain haplotypes. similar observations were made for seed starch accumulation during terminal drought for a diverse set of  <dig> barley accessions.

RESULTS
snp discovery in sequences responding to drought stress
the initial set of  <dig> drought-responsive ests  was determined from  <dig> or  <dig> day old seedlings, flag leaves-post anthesis or developing grains. suitable sequence information from the four parents of mapping population and the four advanced backcross  population parents were obtained for  <dig> genes . the sequence reads were assembled individually for each locus. a total of  <dig>  informative snps were dispersed through  <dig> of the sequences, giving a mean snp density of  <dig>  per kb . the oregon wolfe parents were the best differentiated , which is consistent with comparisons made elsewhere between these two lines  <cit> . some 30% of the loci were polymorphic between cvs. steptoe and morex, as noted in the previous studies for these cultivars  <cit> . the proportion of informative loci in cv. brenda versus hs <dig> was 33%, and between cv. scarlett and isr42_ <dig> 39%. note that a polymorphism survey based on  <dig> microsatellite loci showed that 46% were informative between cv. brenda and hs <dig>  <cit> , while  <dig> out of  <dig>  were polymorphic between cv. scarlett and isr42_ <dig>  <cit> .

marker development and linkage mapping
the snps present in the  <dig> ests were converted into  <dig> pyrosequencing-based markers for steptoe/morex,  <dig> for oregon wolfe and  <dig> markers common to both populations, for a total of  <dig> snp markers . of the  <dig> functional gene categories represented among the  <dig> initially selected ests,  <dig> classes were retained among the genes tagged by the  <dig> markers . genes involved in carbohydrate, amino acid metabolism, hormone signalling, storage protein synthesis and the response to desiccation, as well as a number of transcription factors were particularly common . genotypic data associated with both the  <dig> de novo snp markers , and with an established set of  <dig> gbs  and  <dig> bin markers were then used to construct a  <dig> marker-based map , in which the bin markers were situated as expected  <cit> . the only change in gbs marker order occurred on chromosome arm 3hl, where gbs <dig> mapped distal, rather than proximal to abc <dig>  <cit> . the genetic length of each chromosome ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , and the overall map length was  <dig>  cm . given the unequal genomic distribution of the marker loci, marker development was focussed on chromosomes  <dig> h  and  <dig> h , because these chromosomes are known to harbour drought-related qtl . for example, teulat et al.  <cit>  identified a qtl for drought related traits at the ssr marker ebmac <dig> on  <dig> h analysing grain material from field grown barley from an environment with limited water availability especially during the grain filling period. the marker ebmac <dig> maps close to abc <dig>  <cit> , in a chromosomal region where several de novo markers representing putative candidate genes were mapped. these genes encode transcription regulators , a cytochrome protein , a protein kinase  and the starch branching enzyme . chromosomes  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  contained the least de novo marker, while  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci were mapped to chromosomes  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively. each member of the pairs of sequences gbs3141/gbs <dig>  gbs3193/gbs <dig>  gbs3129/gbs <dig>  and gbs3150/gbs <dig> was derived from the same est, and thus mapped to the same position . the pairs gbs3230/gbs <dig>  gbs3172/gbs <dig> and gbs3154/gbs3155/gbs <dig> each are based upon different est clusters but represent the same gene as they do not overlap due to shorter contigs, and mapped to a single chromosome bin .

overlap with other barley snp maps
only seven of the previously mapped abiotic stress related barley genes belong to the present map of drought-responsive  <dig> de novo snp markers  <cit>  . gbs <dig> and gbs <dig> belong to the same mapped abiotic stress marker scsnp <dig>  mapped to chromosome  <dig> h in  <cit> . on chromosome  <dig> h, gbs <dig> is covered by scsnp <dig>  gbs <dig> by scsnp <dig> and gbs <dig> by scsnp <dig>  gbs <dig>  corresponds to scsnp <dig>  and gbs <dig>  to scsnp <dig>  six of the seven overlapping markers mapped to their expected chromosomal bin, but gbs <dig> appeared to lie proximal, rather than distal to abc <dig>  taken the consensus transcript map in  <cit>  five of the de novo snp loci are represented there, namely gbs3178/gbs <dig> , gbs3158/gbs <dig> , gbs3246/gbs <dig> and gbs3170/gbs <dig> , and gbs3128/gbs <dig> . a further  <dig> gbr or gbm markers identified the same loci as the de novo snps, but two  had a discrepant chromosome location. the pairs gbs3253/gbr <dig> and gbs3185/gbm <dig> all mapped to chromosome  <dig> h but to different bins . another high-density transcript linkage map based on a total of  <dig> snp, caps and indel markers was published by sato et al.  <cit> . according to unigene ids,  <dig> gbs markers show overlap with  <dig> loci of the present map. finally,  <dig> of the  <dig>  snp loci present on the close et al.  <cit>  map correspond to gbs marker, with no discrepancies in terms of chromosomal location. marker 1_ <dig>  was located to chromosome  <dig> h, thereby confirming the position of gbs <dig>  in summary,  <dig> of the  <dig> de novo snp loci of drought-responsive genes represent novel means for characterizing the genetic basis of drought tolerance in barley and they may also provide useful information for the construction of the barley physical map as the next step towards genome sequencing.

the drought stress response of mapped transcripts over development
to reveal the drought stress response of mapped transcripts during various stages of development, we normalized the expression data by utilizing the publicly available expression data sets deposited in gene expression omnibus  from five  and  <dig>  day old seedlings, flag leaves post anthesis , green spike tissues  and own data from developing grain during  <dig> days after fertilization . a range of barley cultivars has been used to generate these data, including the drought tolerant cv. martin and the susceptible cv. moroc9- <dig>  parents of mapping and ab populations . the clustering process identified three major groups: groups  <dig> and  <dig> contained genes which are up-regulated as a result of drought stress, while the ones in group  <dig> were down-regulated . while group  <dig> genes showed up-regulation mostly in early vegetative tissues, group  <dig> members were up-regulated across all developmental stages, and were expressed in a range of organs . thus, group  <dig> genes could be considered to represent a core set of drought responsive genes. the functional groups particularly overrepresented in groups  <dig> and  <dig> included transcription regulators, genes induced by abiotic stress, genes responsible for the synthesis of storage proteins and genes related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, and aba-induced hormone related genes, calculated by fisher's exact test with a p-value cut off  <dig>  .

regulators
an aba signalling gene , a bzip aba-responsive element binding protein  were consistently up-regulated by drought throughout development in barley . in a. thaliana, protein phosphatase 2c regulates a snf1-related kinase  <cit> , and mediates signal transduction to an abf <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . thus in barley, it seems likely that an aba signalling pathway orchestrates the adaptive response to drought, not just at the seedling stage but also in the flag leaf, awn, lemma and palea . in addition several ras family g-proteins  thought to be involved in aba signalling are found to be induced in  <dig> day seedlings and flag leaf . several aba-induced late embryogenesis abundant proteins  were induced to drought in seedlings , and these have been shown previously to be involved in desiccation tolerance  <cit> . a number of aba signalling related genes were included in the genetic map . other transcription factors were induced by drought in a non-organ specific manner; these included ap2/erf ii , vii , viii , bhlh , bzip , myb , nac  and several other unclassified factors . the specific function of most of these regulators remains unclear, but their up-regulation by drought stress indicates that they probably do play a role in the plant's response to water deficit.

abiotic stress induced genes
genes encoding dehydrin  <dig>  universal stress proteins, hydrophobic proteins and various classes of heat shock proteins  were induced by drought across all the developmental stages . among the hsps were hsp <dig> ; hsp81- <dig>  and hsp <dig> , which mapped, respectively, to chromosomes  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h . other hsps were not so generally up-regulated by drought. the up-regulation of hsp is consistent with their presumed protection of proteins from oxidative damage induced by drought stress  <cit> .

drought response of mapped transcripts contributing to seed quality
barley grain storage proteins comprise a mixture of four distinct prolamin polypeptides: the b- and γ-  hordeins, the c-  hordeins and the high molecular weight d-hordeins. the hordein genes are known to be organised in clusters encoding the b-hordeins , c-hordeins , γ-hordein  and d-hordein  which are all located on chromosome  <dig> h  <cit> . the present genetic map showed that gbs <dig>  a marker for b1-hordein, lay near the telomere of chromosome  <dig> h, while gbs <dig>  was linked closer to gbs <dig> , around  <dig> cm distant from gbs <dig> . a third b-hordein marker  was placed further apart, closer to γ3-hordein. thus the b-hordein gene family is represented by at least three different loci on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> h, while the γ-hordein genes also map to two distinct loci on the same chromosome arm .

the regulation of hordein family gene transcription includes dna methylation  <cit>  and the concerted action of distinct transcription factor families  <cit> . the expression of all the sulphur-rich hordein genes was promoted by drought in the awn, lemma and palea . hordein transcripts first appear in the endosperm at  <dig> days post anthesis, peaking in expression by  <dig> days, and then maintaining this level until grain maturity  <cit> . the b1-hordein genes were induced in developing seeds by drought stress in cv. brenda, but less prominently so in hs <dig> , indicating distinct differences in b-hordein gene expression between cultivated barley and its wild relative. correspondingly, the seed nitrogen/protein content also increased under drought in brenda but not in hs <dig>  however, the absolute levels remained high in the control plants .

in contrast, the down-regulation of the gene family members of key starch biosynthesis genes, sucrose synthase, adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase are down-regulated by terminal drought stress in the post anthesis period during  <dig> daf . several genes associated with the activity of the starch branching enzyme became activated by terminal drought stress, which has implications for the synthesis of amylopectin. certain genes involved in starch degradation  were also induced by drought stress, which points to a concerted fine tuning of starch biosynthesis and degradation in impairing seed starch accumulation and seed quality. however, many genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism including the genes encoding sucrose synthase type i , adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit  and starch branching enzyme class ii  were up-regulated by drought stress in seedlings, the flag leaf, the awn, lemma and palea . the production of starch in vegetative tissues of arabidopsis thaliana has been found to be negatively correlated with plant biomass  <cit> . likewise, we might expect that starch accumulation in vegetative tissues negatively affects plant growth under drought stress.

haplotype analysis of carbohydrate metabolism genes
a detailed analysis of sequence variants within  <dig> starch biosynthesis/degradation genes was conducted for a core set of  <dig> accessions, which included landraces, elite breeding lines, the mapping population parents and h. spontaneum. this delivered  <dig> polymorphic sites  across both intronic and exonic sequence, and led to the recognition of  <dig> haplotypes . overall the elite breeding lines, including cv. brenda, showed little haplotypic variation, but the remaining materials fell into a number of haplotype groups indicating broader genetic diversity. figure 5b summarizes the variation present within the genes encoding sucrose synthase types i  and ii  whereas the haplotyping data for the remaining genes are listed in additional file  <dig> 

within the  <dig> bp re-sequenced region of the sucrose synthase type i amplicon,  <dig> snps and a  <dig> bp indels were found. among the snps,  <dig> were situated within an intron and seven  within an exon; the single non-synonymous snp was a transition variant present in cv. morex, which converted a glycine residue to a serine. the accessions could be classified into five haplotypic groups , the largest of which  included all the elite breeding lines and half of the remaining h. vulgare accessions. h <dig> contained only one entry , as did h <dig> . h <dig> captured several h. vulgare and the other h. spontaneum accessions, as well as the oregon wolfe dominant parent. the oregon wolfe recessive parent fell into h <dig> along with two other h. vulgare lines .

gbs <dig> represented about  <dig> bp of the sucrose synthase type ii sequence, and the re-sequencing of  <dig> accessions generated  <dig> snps. these allowed the recognition of seven haplotypes , of which h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> each contained only one accession. the elite breeding lines were split among the two major groups h <dig> and h <dig>  along with most of the h. vulgare accessions, although h <dig> also included isr42- <dig>  an h. spontaneum accession. groups h <dig> and h <dig> each contained three accessions, the former containing the remaining h. spontaneum accessions, and the latter the remaining h. vulgare ones.

the relatively high level of haplotype diversity in these two sucrose synthase genes among non-elite lines suggests that these genes have experienced selection processes during the course of domestication and farmer's selection. however, for improving sink strength specific haplotypes  were fixed in the elite lines during the breeding. in maize, key starch biosynthesis enzymes and soluble carbohydrates were measured from field grown samples from hundred recombinant inbred lines and revealed major qtls close to the locus sucrose synthase  gene known to be linked to improved starch accumulation  <cit> . to confirm the importance of sh <dig> locus, sucrose synthase gene polymorphisms was analyzed in  <dig> genetically unrelated maize lines. therein, the sh <dig> locus was also found to significantly associate with higher starch and amylase content as well as grain matter from multi-location field trials  <cit> . in the present study also a high level of allelic diversity was detected in the genes encoding sucrose synthase i, sucrose synthase ii, starch branching enzyme i and α-glucosidase, while the genes encoding both the small and large subunits of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase were rather non-polymorphic .

haplotype variation was also used to estimate the extent of the genetic separation between cv. brenda and hs <dig>  among the  <dig> informative sequences, three harboured non-synonymous exonic snps. two neighbouring snps within the granule bound starch synthase ib gene  were present in both hs <dig> and a number of the barley accessions, while the snps present in both the ß-amylase  and the γ- <dig> hordein  genes were unique to hs <dig>  another four genes  were found to contain synonymous exonic substitutions. intronic snps were also detected in most of the genes, including the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit sequence , a gene known to undergo alternative splicing  <cit> . these data confirm that wild barley alleles own the capability to alter protein sequences , codon usage  and the splicing process  and emphasize the potential of the brenda/hs <dig> introgression line population to serve as a model for the investigation of favourable wild barley alleles.

intraspecific variation of grain starch content under terminal drought
identifying the molecular basis of phenotypic variation can provide improved insights into the mechanisms responsible for key agronomic traits such as grain yield stability. thus patterns of starch accumulation during terminal drought were monitored for a diverse set of  <dig> barley accessions. a high genetic variation for grain starch content was observed . the starch content of the non-stressed barley landraces varied from 450- <dig> mg/g dry weight, while among the elite breeding lines, the range was 514- <dig> mg/g . within gene bank accessions of h. vulgare and h. spontaneum, two major classes were found; one class suffered a reduction of up to 45% in the amount of starch accumulated under terminal drought conditions, whereas the other performed well in both well-watered and terminal drought conditions . unlike the wild barleys and the landraces, the sample of elite breeding lines showed little variation for starch accumulation, although many performed well under terminal drought stress. three accessions  suffered a slight reduction in grain starch content and, consequently, thousand grain weight  when challenged with terminal drought stress under both field and green house conditions . interestingly, those lines which showed dramatic reduction of starch content under terminal drought in comparison to their respective controls possess haplotypes h <dig> , h <dig>  and h <dig>  from sucrose synthase ii gene  and lines possessing haplotype h <dig>  from sucrose synthase ii gene correlate positively to optimum starch accumulation under both control and drought treatments  . similarly, we also noticed a higher genetic variation for tgw of barley landraces not only under control conditions but also under drought stress . moreover, global correlation analysis between seed starch content and an average of tgw obtained from multi-location field trials from two consecutive years  using both methods  and green house screening for all genotypes under drought stress conditions signifies correlation with r <dig> =  <dig>  at a significance level of α =  <dig>  using steiger's z-test for pearson correlation . the origin and ig-number is provided for all  <dig> barley accessions in additional file  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the genetic mapping of  <dig> drought regulated ests has extended the abiotic stress snp map of barley  <cit>  by a further  <dig> novel markers. an extensive expression analysis of these ests at various developmental stages for drought response and across a range of barley accessions resulted in creating an expression map for genetically mapped markers. the mapped candidate genes have been reported to co-segregate with drought related traits, which fall into diverse functional categories like stress response , transcription factors , carbohydrate metabolism  and many more  <cit> . the map also disclosed an interesting correlation between several clusters of sulphur-rich hordeins on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> h and their co-expression, potentially linked to methylation based regulation  <cit> .

the haplotype structure of  <dig> starch biosynthesis/degradation genes was explored, revealing that the genes encoding sucrose synthase  and starch synthase were surprisingly variable in wild barley and landraces. superior alleles related to haplotype h <dig> from sucrose synthase i and h <dig> from sucrose synthase ii were found to be present in the studied breeding lines too, selected for improved performance. this observation provides additional evidence that these alleles may be causally associated with improved starch accumulation under control as well as terminal drought stress conditions. the gained knowledge represents a valuable source for the development of functional markers to assess larger collections of barley accessions for the correlation of relevant haplotypes of starch biosynthesis/degradation genes to seed starch content under drought and, therefore, for further improvement of barley cultivars in terms of improved grain weight.
