BACKGROUND
cyclic amp receptor protein , also known as catabolite gene activator protein , is an important transcriptional regulator widely distributed in a variety of bacterial groups  <cit> . the biological processes under the regulation of crp are highly diverse, including energy metabolism  <cit> , cell division and development  <cit> , toxin production  <cit> , competence development  <cit> , quorum sensing  <cit>  and cellular motility  <cit> . crp belongs to the crp/fnr transcription factor  superfamily  <cit> , which are generally believed to function as global regulators throughout the eubacteria  <cit> . each member of the crp/fnr superfamily contains an n-terminal effector binding domain and a c-terminal helix-turn-helix  dna binding domain   <cit> . the tfs of this superfamily form a homodimer in vivo, and are activated by the binding of specific small effector molecules to their effector binding domains  <cit> . the crp dimer is activated by the binding of two camp molecules to the effector binding domain of each subunit, which causes a conformational change in the dbds, allowing each to bind to half of a specific pseudo-palindromic dna sequence in the promoters of the genes that are under crp regulation  <cit> . upon the binding, crp interacts with the c-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of the rna polymerase, affecting the rna polymerase binding to the promoter, and thus leads to the change of the transcription initiation rate of the target gene  <cit> .

the functions of crp as well as its target genes  have been well studied in e. coli and other heterotrophic bacteria  <cit> , and it seems that all the sequenced e. coli genomes encode one copy of the crp gene. crp in e. coli is characterized as a global regulator, which controls the expression of more than  <dig> transcriptional units involved in various important biological processes of this organism  <cit> . through decades of research,  <dig> crp binding sites  in this species have been experimentally identified, which show a pseudo-palindromic consensus in the form of tgtgan6tcaca. more recently, slightly different crp binding sites with the consensus tgcgan6tcgca were also identified in e. coli and other γ-proteobacteria  <cit> . one of the major functions of crp in e. coli involves the transcriptional regulation of genes related to organic carbon assimilation and energy metabolism  <cit> .

as the life of e. coli and other heterotrophic organisms relies on the assimilation of organic carbon sources from the environment, it is not surprising that crp works as an important global regulator to coordinate a variety of biological processes in these organisms. cyanobacteria, on the other hand, are a group of autotrophic organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis; therefore, they do not rely on organic carbon source from the environment. intriguingly, at least half of the sequenced cyanobacterial genomes encode at least one copy of the crp gene . crp proteins have been experimentally studied in two cyanobacterial strains, i.e. synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>   <cit>  and anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>   <cit> . in the pcc <dig> genome, the open reading frame  sll <dig> encodes a homologue to the e. coli crp gene  <cit> , and has been named sycrp <dig>  it has been shown that the product of this gene, sycrp <dig> forms a homodimer, which can bind camp with high affinity in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, in the presence of camp, sycrp <dig> could form a complex with dna that contains the consensus crp binding site similar to that in e. coli   <cit> . further studies have revealed that sycrp <dig> was essential for type iv pilus biogenesis and was involved in cell motility in pcc <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, in the pcc <dig> genome two orfs, alr <dig> and alr <dig>  were found to encode putative crps, and were named ancrpa and ancrpb, respectively  <cit> . equilibrium dialysis measurements showed that both ancrpa and ancrpb  could bind camp. electrophoresis mobility shift assay  further demonstrated that ancrpa could bind to the consensus crp binding site in e. coli  <cit> . it has also been reported that both ancrpa and ancrpb are functional in pcc <dig>  the former regulates the expression of several genes involved in nitrogen fixation  <cit> , and the latter controls the genes induced by nitrogen depletion  <cit> . a few crp binding sites in these two genomes have also been experimentally determined, which were found to form a palindromic motif with the consensus sequence tgtgan6tcaca similar to that in e.coli  <cit> . in addition, the promoter regions of most of these identified crp-activated genes in these two cyanobacterial genomes also contain an e. coli - <dig> σ70-like box , located ~ <dig> bp downstream the crp binding site. these studies also suggested that crps in cyanobacteria might regulate a very different set of genes than those in e. coli. however, a systematic genome-scale study of the potential crp target genes as well as crp binding sites in cyanobacteria is hitherto lacking. in this paper, we have predicted the crp regulons as well as crp binding sites in  <dig> sequenced cyanobacterial genomes that encode at least one copy of the crp gene using a highly effective motif scanning algorithm  <cit> . we have also investigated the degradation of the crp binding sites in the rest of sequenced cyanobacterial genomes in which the crp genes were lost during the course of evolution.

methods
 <dig>  materials
genome sequences, predicted orfs and annotation files of the following  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes were downloaded from the ncbi website at : acaryochloris marina mbic <dig> , anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> , anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> , gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. as <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. mit  <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. mit  <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. mit  <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus mit <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus mit <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. mit  <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. mit  <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus str. natl1a , prochlorococcus marinus str. natl2a , prochlorococcus marinus ccmp <dig> , prochlorococcus marinus med <dig> , synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> , synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> , synechococcus sp. cc <dig> , synechococcus sp. cc <dig> , synechococcus sp. ja-2-3b'a , synechococcus sp. ja-3-3ab , synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> , synechococcus sp. cc <dig> , synechococcus sp. rcc <dig> , synechococcus sp. wh  <dig> , synechococcus sp. wh <dig> , thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig> , and trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> .

 <dig>  prediction of operons
we predicted operon structures in each cyanobacterial genomes using the operon finder software  developed by westover et al  <cit> . ofs predicts operons based on three pieces of information, including the intergenic distance, functional relatedness of gene annotations, and conserved gene neighborhoods. in this study, both a multi-gene operon and a singleton operon containing only one gene are referred as a transcription unit .

 <dig>  prediction of orthologues
a simple bidirectional best hit  approach using the blastp program with an e-value cutoff 10- <dig> was used for the prediction of orthologous genes between each pair of genomes.

 <dig>  phylogenetic analysis
to construct the crp tree, the full length amino acid sequences of cyanobacterial crps were identified by the criteria described above using sycrp <dig>  in pcc <dig> as the query sequence. multiple sequence alignments of the identified cyanobacterial crp sequences and that of e. coli k <dig> were performed using clustalw implemented in mega  <cit>  with default settings. a neighbor-joining  tree with poisson correction was constructed using the mega program with the e. coli crp  being the outgroup. to construct the tree in figure s <dig> , we used sycrp <dig> as the query sequence to search the refseq database using blastp with an e-value cutoff 10- <dig>  if there were multiple hits from a species, the hit with the smallest e-value was identified as the crp in that species. the resulting sequences were used to construct an un-rooted tree in the similar way as described above. to construct the species tree, the dna sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the sequenced cyanobacteria and that of e. coli k <dig> were aligned using clustalw with manual refinement. after the indels were discarded, the final alignments contain  <dig> positions. a neighbor-joining tree of the  <dig> rrna gene sequences was constructed with the e. coli k <dig> sequence being the outgroup using kimura 2-parameter model. statistical significance at each node in the trees was evaluated using  <dig> bootstrap resamplings.

 <dig>  phylogenetic footprinting and construction of the profile of crp binding sites in cyanobacteria
a previous screening of the target genes of sycrp <dig> in pcc <dig> using microarray showed that  <dig> genes in  <dig> putative tus were down-regulated in a sycrp <dig> disruptant compared with the wild type strain  <cit> . our preliminary manual scanning of the upstream promoter regions of these tus revealed that four of them contain a putative crp binding site similar to those in e. coli . the rest nine tus that do not contain putative crp binding sites are likely to be regulated indirectly by crp through different regulators. in addition, since the crp gene is auto-regulated in e. coli as well as in many other species  <cit> , we also manually scanned the upstream inter-tu region of sycrp <dig>  and identified a putative crp binding site in it . we thus used the orthologues  of these five tus for the phylogenetic footprinting of crp binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes.

 <dig>  bold, the highly conserved positions within the palindromic crp binding sites.

 <dig>  position of the putative crp binding site relative to the first codon in the tu.

for this purpose, we pooled the entire upstream inter-tu regions of these five tus in pcc <dig>  as well as those of tus containing their orthologous genes in other cyanobacterial genomes which encode at least one crp gene. motif finding programs including cubic  <cit>  and bioprospector  <cit> , were then applied to predict crp binding sites in these sequences. cubic is a graph theoretic based algorithm that identifies highly similar k-mers in a set of pooled sequences; while bioprospector uses a gibbs sampling strategy to find overrepresented k-mers in a set of pooled sequences. putative crp binding sites with high scores were manually picked up from the motif finding results, and were used to build a preliminary profile of the crp binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes.

since the number of binding sites used to construct the preliminary profile of crp binding sites was relatively small , in order to minimize possible bias of binding site sampling, we conducted a one-round iteration to obtain a more representative profile of the crp binding sites. to this end, we scanned cyanobacterial genomes with the preliminary profile using the techniques described below, and picked the high scoring sites from each genome to construct the more representative profile of the crp binding sites. we then used this final profile for genome-scale predictions of crp binding sites in the cyanobacterial genomes.

 <dig>  genome-wide prediction of crp binding sites
the whole genome screening of all possible crp binding sites were performed using an algorithm that we have developed previously  <cit> . the design of this algorithm is to enhance the prediction specificity by integrating the information of co-occurrence of multiple binding sites in the upstream region of a gene and that in the upstream regions of its orthologues in related genomes. briefly, the final profile of the crp binding sites obtained above was first used to scan all the inter-tu regions of the cyanobacterial genomes. the best motif was returned for each inter-tu region. then the  <dig> to  <dig> bp downstream region of each putative binding site was further scanned for an e. coli - <dig> σ- <dig> like box  using a corresponding profile that we have constructed previously from cyanobacterial genomes  <cit> , to which a σ-factor of rna polymerase is likely to bind to transcribe the downstream tu. then, the upstream inter-tu regions of the orthologues of the genes in that particular tu in other cyanobacterial genomes were scanned for similar crp binding sites and - <dig> like boxes. a score that combines these three pieces of information was computed to rank the putative crp binding sites for each possible crp-regulated tu.

specifically, let m be the final profile of the crp binding sites obtained above. for each predicted transcription unit u containing genes g <dig>  ..., gn in a genome g, we extract the entire upstream intergenic region  and denoted it as iu. we also extracted a random dna sequence with the same length as iu from the coding region, denoted as cu. we say that iu and cu are associated with u and with each genes g <dig>  ..., gn as well. all the extracted iu from one genome are denoted as set iu, and all the cu in the same genome are denoted as set cu. for each t ∈ iu or t ∈ cu, we scan for possible crp bindings sites using the profile m. the score of a putative binding site found in t by scanning with profile m is defined as,

  sm=max⁡h⊂t∑i=1liiln⁡p)q), 

  ii=ln⁡pq)/a, 

  a=n+1n+4ln⁡−ln⁡−1n+4∑b∈{a,c,g,t}ln⁡q−nn+4ln⁡min⁡b∈{a,c,g,t}q, 

where l is the length of the binding sites of m, h any substring of t with length l, h the base at the i-th position of h, p the relative frequency of base b occurring at position i in m, q the background frequency of base b, and n the number of sequences used to construct m. when computing p, a pseudo count  <dig> is added to the frequency of each base at each position, and a is for normalization to keep ii within the range of  <cit> .

when multiple profiles are considered for scanning t, we sum up the individual sm s as defined by

  sm <dig> ..mz=∑j=1zsmj. 

for this study, we use m <dig> for the crp binding sites and m <dig> for the - <dig> like box .

for the inter-tu sequence t associated with u in genome g, if gi has orthologues in mi closely related genomes g <dig> ...,gmi, we denote ok as the inter-tu sequence upstream the tu containing gi 's orthologue in genome gk. when the presence of similar motifs in ok is also considered, the score of co-occurrence of the multiple binding sites in t is redefined as

  s=sm <dig> ..mz+max⁡1<i<n∑j=1z∑k=1milj−di,j,kmiljsmj), 

where di, j, k is the hamming distance between the sequence found by using profile mj in t and ok, lj the length of binding site motif with profile mj.

 <dig>  statistical evaluation of the predicted binding sites
we evaluated the statistical significance of our predictions by comparing the probability of finding a high scoring binding site in inter-tu sequences with that of finding the same high scoring binding site in randomly extracted coding sequences  <cit> . let p be the probability that an extracted sequence t  contains a putative binding site with a score  larger than s. to avoid possible biased sampling,  <dig> cus for each tu in each genome were randomly generated, and scu was computed for each cu. then a log-odd ratio  function defined as following was used to estimate the confidence of the prediction:

  lor=ln⁡pp. 

since p is the probability of type-i error for testing the null hypothesis that iu does not contain a binding site when siu is greater than a cutoff s, we used it to estimate the false positive rate of the prediction results. in this way, p could be also considered as an empirical p-value, and a cutoff of p <  <dig>  was used for the crp binding site prediction in each genome.

RESULTS
 <dig>  conservation of the dbds of the crp proteins in cyanobacterial genomes
using the bdbh algorithm and the criterion described in methods, we identified orthologues of sycrp <dig>  of pcc <dig> in  <dig> of the  <dig> sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. all these  <dig> genomes encode one sycrp <dig> homologue, with the exception that the pcc <dig> and pcc <dig> genomes contain two: sll <dig> and sll <dig>  in pcc <dig>  and alr <dig>  and alr <dig>  in pcc <dig>  which are identified by a unidirectional blastp search using sycrp <dig> of pcc <dig> as the query and an e-value cutoff 10- <dig>  the phylogenetic tree of these  <dig> crp orthologues shows that they fall into two distinct groups . there are clear subtle differences between the dbds of the two groups. nonetheless, the residues of the dbd that are in direct interaction with the dna counterpart as revealed by the crystal structure of e. coli crp/dna complex  <cit> , are highly conserved in all these cyanobacterial crp sequences, suggesting that they might bind to similar dna sequences .

 <dig>  profiles of the crp binding sites predicted by phylogenetic footprinting
when the  <dig> genes located in the five tus  in pcc <dig> that are likely to be regulated by sycrp <dig> in this species, are searched against the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that encode crp genes, we found a total of  <dig> orthologues in five genomes. these  <dig> orthologous genes are located in a total of  <dig> tus in these five genomes, indicating that these tus are not well conserved in these  <dig> genomes. by using the phylogenetic footprinting techniques , we predicted a total of eight putative crp binding sites from the  <dig> upstream inter-tu regions, suggesting that the crp binding sites are largely shared by these orthologous genes. in order to increase the representation of the profile of the crp binding sites and to minimize the possible bias of our original choice of the five tus, we performed a one-round iteration of putative crp binding site scanning using this preliminary profile constructed from these eight putative crp binding sites . from this preliminary whole genome scanning results, we selected a total of  <dig> putative crp binding sites  with high scores to construct the final profile of crp binding sites. these sites display a strong pseudo-palindromic structure with consensus tgtgan6tcaca , which is similar to the canonical crp binding sites in e. coli, suggesting that the pattern of crp binding sites is well conserved between cyanobacterial and e. coli. this result is also in agreement with the observation that the binding sites of members of the crp/fnr superfamily maintain a high level of conservation across difference lineages  <cit> .

 <dig>  genome-wide prediction of crp binding sites in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes
we then apply our motif scanning algorithm to predict putative crp binding sites in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that encode a crp gene using the profile of the  <dig> putative crp binding sites as well as that of the previously prepared - <dig> like box from cyanobacteria  <cit> . the log-odds ratio  function of the predictions in each genome is all high when the score s is high , suggesting that these genomes are likely to contain functional crp binding sites. the predictions in each of the  <dig> genomes at p-value <  <dig>  are listed in tables s3-s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  and all the prediction results are available upon request. in general, all these predicted crp promoters contain a pseudo-palindromic crp binding site and most of them also contain a downstream ta-rich σ-factor binding site, therefore they are likely to be true crp promoters. as shown in table s <dig> , the five crp binding sites associated with the five tus  in pcc <dig>  which we selected as the starting point of the our genome-wide prediction, were not necessarily ranked very high  among the  <dig> predicted crp binding sites in that genome, suggesting that our initial choice of the five tus did not bias our prediction to them. table  <dig> summarizes the predictions in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes, and the most prevalent genes of predicted crp regulons are listed in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> 

 <dig>  calculated as the number of genes that have an orthologue in the e. coli k <dig> genome normalized to the total number of genes in that genome.

although it has been estimated that crp controls the expression of more than  <dig> tus in e. coli  <cit> , and the regulondb  contains  <dig> experimentally verified crp binding sites, the number of predicted crp binding sites at p-value <  <dig>  in each cyanobacterial genomes is relatively small, ranging from  <dig> in bp- <dig>  to  <dig> in atcc <dig> , if one considers that the e. coli k <dig> genome encodes a total of  <dig> putative tus , and that some of these cyanobacterial genomes contain much more tus/genes  than the e. coli k <dig> genome does. this result suggests that cyanobacterial crps might regulate fewer genes than the e. coli crp does. we then ask whether the target genes of crps are conserved between e. coli and cyanobacteria, as well as among the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes, given that the dbds of crps as well as their binding sites are highly conserved.

although these  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes share  <dig> ~ <dig> % of their genes with e. coli , they almost have no common genes in their crp regulons with that of e. coli k <dig> , suggesting that the crps in cyanobacteria have adapted to regulate very different sets of genes than those in e. coli during the course of evolution. on the other hand, the majority of the crp targets in these cyanobacterial genomes are not conserved either, rather, only a small portion of the crp targets are shared by more than  <dig> of the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes , even though our motif scanning algorithm might be biased toward the genes that have orthologues in reference genomes . in the extreme cases, many crp targets are species or lineage specific, suggesting that the targets of crp have changed very rapidly since the speciation of these cyanobacterial genomes. for example, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> putative crp target genes in the pcc <dig> genome are conserved in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes. the only exception is the pcc <dig> genome in which the number is  <dig> out of  <dig>  however, this is largely because the reference genomes include a closely related species atcc <dig>  moreover, the most conserved putative crp-regulated genes are only shared by five genomes . in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> sequenced cyanobacterial genome do not encode the crp gene, suggesting that crp is not required for the life of these  <dig> organisms; alternatively, the function of crp in these organisms have been replaced by another tf.

 <dig>  functional classification of crp regulons in cyanobacteria
based on the functional annotations of the crp target genes that we have predicted in this study, crp seems to be involved in a rather diverse spectrum of functions in cyanobacteria  as summarized below.

 <dig> . photosynthesis and carbon fixation
various numbers of genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation were predicted to bear a crp-regulated promoter in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that encode crp genes. specifically, a total of  <dig>  photosystem i and ii reaction center genes were predicted to be regulated by crp, including am1_ <dig>  asr <dig>  ava_ <dig>  ava_ <dig>  asr <dig>  cya_ <dig>  cyb_ <dig>  pmt <dig>  p9303_ <dig>  p9303_ <dig>  syncc9605_ <dig>  sll <dig>  slr <dig>  and tery_ <dig>  several carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism protein ccmk genes, including alr0317- <dig> and slr1838-slr <dig>  were also predicted to bear a crp binding site. moreover, putative crp-regulated promoters were found for the phycobiliprotein family light-harvesting genes, including alr0523- <dig>  sll1577- <dig>  ssl <dig>  slr <dig> and tsr <dig>  in consistent with these results, it has been previously shown that cellular camp levels change significantly in response to environmental stimuli such as light-dark cycle  <cit> . thus cyanobacterial crps are likely to participate in photosynthesis pathways.

 <dig> . nitrogen assimilation
three nitrogenase related proteins am1_ <dig>  ava_ <dig> and alr <dig> in mbic <dig>  atcc <dig>  and pcc <dig>  respectively, were predicted to be crp-regulated. furthermore, an operon encoding a nitrate transporter  in pcc <dig> was predicted to bear a crp binding site. it has been previously reported that nitrogen starvation resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in intracellular camp level in anabaena variabilis  <cit> . based on our prediction results, a possible scenario for a role of crp in the signaling pathway of nitrogen assimilation could be as follows. nitrogen starvation somehow increases the adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to an increase in the intracellular camp level. the activation of crp by camp then lowers the transcription level of genes such as nitrate transporter , while it enhances the expression of genes like alr <dig>  and nitrogenase , as the cell switches to the more energy intensive nitrogen fixation of nitrogen gas. nonetheless, an in-depth study is needed to elucidate the details of the role that crp may play in nitrogen fixation in these cyanobacteria. since not all cyanobacterial species are capable of nitrogen fixation, this role of crp is unique to the cyanobacterial species capable of nitrogen fixation, such as mbic <dig>  atcc <dig>  and pcc <dig> 

 <dig> . transporters and porins
a few genes coding for transporters and porins were predicted to be crp-regulated, including several ion transporter in pcc <dig>  and pcc <dig> . besides, several antiporters and abc transporters were also predicted to be crp-regulated in various genomes, e.g. cya_ <dig>  ava_ <dig>  sll <dig>  slr1452- <dig>  tll <dig> 

 <dig> . kinases and two-component signal transduction systems
dozens of genes coding for kinases and two-component signal transduction systems were predicted to be crp-regulated, suggesting that crp might play an important role in response to environmental changes in cyanobacteria. interestingly, it has been reported that the crps in pcc <dig> are involved in phototaxis as both sycrp <dig> and adenylyl cyclase mutants showed impaired phototaxis  <cit> . however, the genes that are involved in signal transduction for pilus assembly and phototaxis, as listed in  <cit> , were not predicted to be crp-regulated by our algorithm, therefore, they might be regulated by crp indirectly.

 <dig> . other functions unique to a species/lineage
among the top hits of our prediction results, a large portion of putative crp-regulated genes are species or lineage specific. the functions of these genes vary from genome to genome, such as the type iv pilus synthesis in pcc <dig>  and mbic <dig> ; various transposase in pcc <dig> , bp- <dig>  and ims <dig> ; methyltransferase in mbic <dig> ; aldo/keto reductase in a/b-prime ; nbla in bp- <dig> ; tpr repeat containing protein in atcc <dig> ; peptidase in mit <dig> ; nuclease in cc <dig> , etc. however, the functions of many other species or lineage specific putative crp-regulated genes are largely unknown, most of them are annotated as hypothetical proteins, such as slr <dig>  sll <dig>  ssr <dig> and sll <dig> in pcc <dig>  asr <dig> in pcc <dig>  am1_3950- <dig>  am1_ <dig>  am1_ <dig> and am1_2209- <dig> in mbic <dig>  cya_0127/cyb_ <dig> in a/b-prime, tery_ <dig> and tery_ <dig> in ims <dig>  ava_ <dig> in atcc <dig>  pmt <dig>  and pmt <dig> in mit <dig>  p9303_ <dig>  p9303_ <dig> and p9303_ <dig> in mit <dig>  sync_ <dig>  and sync_ <dig> in cc <dig>  and syncc9605_ <dig> and syncc9605_ <dig> in cc <dig>  it would be interesting to experimentally characterize the functions of these genes as well as the roles that crp plays in their transcriptional regulation.

 <dig>  crp genes were lost in some cyanobacterial genomes during the course of evolution
the presence of crp genes in some, but not all cyanobacterial genomes, raised the question about their evolutionary origin: are crp genes in cyanobacteria acquired through horizontal gene transfer  from other species, or are they vertically inherited from their last common ancestor, but lost in some cyanobacterial species/strains? to address this question, we constructed a species tree of the  <dig> sequenced cyanobacterial genomes based on their 16s rrna gene sequences . although some nodes in the tree are not well supported by the currently available sequence data, the relationships of the species in the tree are in excellent agreement with a previously inferred cyanobacterial species tree  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the genomes encoding a crp gene do not form a particular monophyletic group, rather, they are sporadically scattered across the tree. on the other hand, all the known cyanobacterial crps form a monophyletic group , suggesting that they are likely derived from a common ancestor. therefore, the current sporadic distribution of the crp genes within the sequenced cyanobacteria likely resulted from differential gene losses during the course of evolution. independent acquisition of the crp gene by individual cyanobacterial lineage/species, though theoretically possible, is less parsimonious since it would entail multiple hgt events from the same or closely related donors. therefore, we conclude that the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that do not encode a crp gene actually lost their original ones during the course of evolution to adapt to their respective environments. it is interesting to note that most of the species lacking a crp gene belong to marine cyanobacteria; these species often have a reduced genome and inhabit a relative stable oligotrophic environment. on the other hand, the species that contain a crp gene are distributed in both fresh water and terrestrial environment. this again suggests that the crp gene might be beneficial to the species that live in a variable environment, and those that have adapted to a more stable environment such as oligotrophic ocean lost their crp genes.

 <dig>  degradation of crp binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes after the crp genes were lost
we have previously shown that when a genome lost a tf in the course of evolution, then it would rapidly lose its cognate biding sites in inter-tu regions  <cit> . to extend this conclusion, we applied our crp binding site prediction algorithm to the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that do not encode a crp orthologue. indeed, in four genomes, namely, cc <dig>  rcc <dig>  wh <dig> and wh <dig> , the lor function oscillates around zero as the score s increases, indicating that there is no significant difference between the signal of crp binding sites in the inter-tu regions and that in the randomly selected coding regions . these results strongly suggest that these four genomes are unlikely to contain functional crp binding sites, which is in agreement with our previous observation  <cit> . however, there is a clear crp binding site signal in the rest of  <dig> genomes as indicated by their relatively high lor when the score s is high, suggesting that there exist crp-like binding sites in the inter-tu regions in these genomes. the reason for this unexpected observation is unknown, but one explanation would be that these sites are bound by a different regulator in these genomes. to identify possible tfs in these genomes that are likely bind these crp-like binding sites, we analyze the distribution of the crp/fnr superfamily in these genomes, and found that they all encode at least one member of the superfamily, which are likely to recognize these crp-like binding sites, as it has been shown that members of the crp/frn superfamily recognize similar consensus sequence, and the binding specificity is achieved through competitive binding among the members.

discussion
 <dig>  crp is a lineage-specific global regulator
studies have shown that crp in e. coli functions as an important global regulator controlling the expression of genes involved in many pathways such as the carbon and energy metabolism pathways. it was also reported that crp regulates a variety of genes in other bacterial species. for instance, one recent study showed that crp-like protein regulates genes involved in quorum sensing, motility and intestinal colonization in vibrio cholerae  <cit> . in this study, we suggest that crp in cyanobacteria seems to have distinct functions. first, our results show that the members of the crp regulons in cyanobacteria have little in common with those in e. coli , which is consistent with the observation that genes whose expression is mostly affected by sycrp <dig> disruption in pcc <dig> are involved in the type iv pilus synthesis  <cit> . in contrast, genes that are involved in carbon and energy metabolisms as seen in e. coli are not significantly affected by sycrp <dig> disruption  <cit> . second, cyanobacterial crps seem to regulate distinct sets of genes specific to each lineage or strain as we can not clearly identify a particular set of genes common to most of the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that are under crp control . third, more than half  of the  <dig> completely sequenced cyanobacterial genomes do not encode a crp orthologue, suggesting that crp is dispensable in these strains/species. for a closely related group of species, it is unlikely that an essential global regulator can be replaced or lost in some genomes while present in the others. therefore, we conclude that crp is not a global regulator with conserved functions; instead, it is likely a lineage-specific global regulator.

in fact, it has been shown that global regulators are not necessarily conserved in moderately related species. for instance, among the  <dig> and  <dig> global regulators in e. coli and b. subtilis, respectively, none of them is in common  <cit> . furthermore, it is not surprising that crp in cyanobacteria does not function as a conserved global regulator as seen in e. coli, given that crp is mainly involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes related to carbon metabolism in e. coli, while organic carbon assimilation is no longer a constraint for the growth of autotrophic cyanobacteria. on the other hand, since nitrogen assimilation is a constraint for cyanobacteria, the nitrogen assimilation regulator, ntca, a member of the crp/fnr family, which is unanimously encode in all the  <dig> sequenced genomes, has been characterized as one of the conserved global regulators in cyanobacteria. thus, it seems that global regulators are often lineage-specific and that the environment plays a vital role in determining which tf functions as a global regulator, and which genes are regulated by the tf.

 <dig>  the functions of crp in cyanobacteria are highly diverse
it has been reported that sycrp <dig> regulates the cellular motility in pcc <dig>  as sycrp <dig> disruptants were devoid of mobility and showed reduced type iv pilus biogenesis  <cit> . in another study, it was shown that the operons slr1667-slr <dig> and slr2015-slr <dig> in pcc <dig>  which are involved in type iv pilus biosynthesis  <cit> , were down-regulated in sycrp <dig> disruptants using microarray gene expression profiling  <cit> . in consistent with these findings, we have predicted putative crp binding sites for these genes. however, the slr1667-slr <dig> genes were unique to pcc <dig>  and the orthologues of slr2015-slr <dig> could only be found in mbic <dig>  among the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes. thus, this function of crp is likely to be restricted to these two species/strains only. in addition, based on our predictions of crp regulons in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes, we argue that crp might be also involved in other functions in different cyanobacterial lineage/strains, including carbon fixation, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, ion channels/transporters, and two-component signal transduction, etc. . furthermore, as a large portion of our predicted crp binding sites are associated with hypothetical proteins, crp might be involved in the regulation of the other novel functions yet to be discovered. in this regard, we have provided a set of candidates for further experimental characterization. however, due to the lack of sufficient information about the functions of the crp target genes, it is currently rather difficult to derive a general pathway model involving crp regulons in cyanobacteria. lastly, ancrpa was shown to regulate the expression of genes related to nitrogen fixation in pcc <dig>  <cit> , including all <dig> , all <dig>  all <dig> , alr <dig> , and alr <dig> . however, our algorithm failed to find high scoring crp binding sites for all these genes, the possible reasons for this are addressed below.

 <dig>  binding sites of ancrpa in anabaena sp. pcc7120
our failure to identify high scoring crp binding sites in the upstream regions of these nitrogen fixation genes in pcc <dig> is actually in agreement with the finding by suzuki and coworkers who suggested that ancrpa might have a different binding site pattern from the conventional pseudo-palindromic motif  <cit> . however, an in vitro binding affinity test using emsa showed that ancrpa could bind to the conventional palindromic motif  <cit> . thus, a possible explanation of this inconsistency would be that ancrpa in pcc <dig> could form a monomer or a heterodimer in addition to a homodimer, given that two crp homologues are encoded in this genome, and one of them does not have a dbd. such a monomer or heterodimer might favor a non-canonical crp binding site, while the homodimer remains its ability to bind to the conventional palindromic motif. clearly, a more in-depth study on this topic is needed to verify this hypothesis. this explanation is in agreement with the results that our algorithm predicts many crp binding sites for other genes in pcc <dig> with statistical significance .

 <dig>  origin of crp genes in cyanobacteria and implications for the evolution of crp regulatory networks in bacteria
because the crp gene is widely distributed in many distantly related bacterial groups, including actinobacteria, aquificales, bacteroidetes, chlamydiae, chloroflexi, cyanobacteria, deinococci, firmicutes, fibrobacteres, planctomycetes, proteobacteria, spirochaetes, etc. , it was likely present in the common ancestor of the extant eubacterial lineages. under this scenario, the crp gene in this ancestor was flexible enough to regulate different sets of genes. alternatively, it is also possible that the crp gene originally evolved in a specific bacterial lineage and was subsequently spread to other groups via hgt. such hgt events may benefit the recipient organism given the flexibility of crp in regulating different biochemical activities, which are often coupled to environment stimuli leading to the generation of intracellular signaling molecule camp. therefore, the crp gene in the ancestor of modern cyanobacteria was acquired by either vertical inheritance or an ancient hgt event from other lineages. some cyanobacteria lost their crp genes since harboring the gene might not necessarily increase their fitness in their new environments. on the other hand, in other cyanobacteria, the crp genes were adapted to better meet their unique physiology and environmental requirements. in other groups of bacteria, crp evolved to regulate other lineage/species specific functions. for instance, it regulates the carbon and energy metabolisms in e. coli, cell-cell communication in stenotrophomonas maltophilia  <cit> , and quorum sensing in vibrio cholerae  <cit> , etc

 <dig>  rapid degradation of crp binding sites
evolution of cis-regulatory binding sites is an interesting, but not well-studied problem. the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that do not encode a crp orthologue provided us an excellent opportunity to examine the degradation of the crp binding site in these genomes. it was expected that high scoring crp binding sites do not present in those genomes, as previous studies have indicated that binding sites rapidly fade out when the corresponding tf was lost during the course of evolution  <cit> . we do see such fading in the cc <dig>  rcc <dig>  wh <dig>  and wh <dig> genomes . these observations were in consistent with the well-accepted rule that "if no such a tf in a genome, then no corresponding binding sites in the genome". however, surprisingly, in the rest  <dig> genomes, high scoring crp-like binding sites seem to appear in the inter-tu regions with a higher probability than in the randomly selected coding regions , suggesting that there exist sequence patterns similar to crp binding sites in these cyanobacterial genomes. a possible explanation of this unexpected observation would be that there exist in these genome tfs that recognize binding sites similar to crp binding sites. indeed, at least one member of the crp/fnr superfamily is encoded in these  <dig> genomes, and it has been shown that the binding sites of the members of this tf superfamily are well conserved across many species with a wide range of evolutionary distance  <cit> . thus, the crp-like binding sites found in these genomes are likely to be recognized by these non-crp tfs of the superfamily. the specificity of these similar binding sites is likely to be achieved through the competition among homologous tfs for the same binding site, which is governed by their thermodynamic equilibrium  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have predicted crp binding sites in  <dig> cyanobacteria genomes that encode a crp orthologue using a highly accurate motif scanning algorithm. based on the analysis of these predictions as well as experimental data available to us, we conclude that 1) crp has rather different functions in cyanobacteria than in e. coli; 2) cyanobacterial crp also has a very diverse spectrum of functions in different lineages or species/stains, and is even dispensable in some species/strain; 3) crps in modern cyanobacteria are likely to be vertically inherited from their last common ancestor, and some cyanobacteria lost their crp genes during the course of evolution to adapt to their new environments; and 4) once the crp gene is lost, its binding sites degrade rapidly. although many of our predictions still await experimental verification, we should have provided a high quality candidate set for further experimental characterization of the crp binding sites and regulons in this important group of bacteria.
