BACKGROUND
to adapt to challenging environments, plants have developed dramatic modifications in morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular processes. gene duplications are widespread in plant genomes, having accumulated a wealth of genetic raw materials to meet the selection pressures of new environmental conditions  <cit> . after gene duplications, there are several possible fates for duplicated genes , which include subfunctionalization through purifying selections   <cit> , neofunctionalization through positive selections   <cit> , pseudogenization  <cit> , and loss in genome   <cit> . subfunctionalization is the predominant paralog outcome following duplications  <cit> . it reduces the fitness cost of gene duplication by buffering dosage imbalances, as well as maintaining the functional requirements of the ancestral locus  <cit> .

in plants, phosphorus is one of three primary mineral nutrients. it is second most limiting macronutrient for optimal growth, due to the relatively large amounts of pi required by plants, the limited amount of available phosphorus , and the poor mobility of phosphorus in soil  <cit> . plant uptake of pi from soil relies heavily upon the phosphate transporter  <dig> family   <cit> . pht <dig> genes code for plasma membrane proteins, which contain  <dig> transmembrane domains. the pht <dig> proteins are functionally involved in pi uptake from the soil, pi translocation across plant tissues, and pi remobilization from senescent organs . homologous genes of pht <dig> have been identified in a wide range of species, and they share conserved functions in the pi uptake   <cit>  and variable pi affinity  <cit> .

the soybean has experienced the gamma whole genome triplication  ~ <dig> to  <dig> million years ago , the legume wgd , and the glycine wgd in the glycine lineage   <cit> . as a result, in the present soybean genome, about 75% of the genes have multiple paralogs  <cit> . approximately 50% of these paralogs were differentially expressed and underwent subfunctionalization  <cit> , possibly contributing to phenotypic variation in polyploids  <cit> .

many pht <dig> genes have functionally identified in many plants, but they are studied as an individual. this was a limiting step for both further functional characterization of pht <dig> family as a whole and genetic evolution analysis of them in relation to low pi environment adaptations. in this study,  <dig> gmpht <dig>  family paralogs from soybean were identified. based on data from spatio-temporal expression profiles, functional characterizations in a heterologous yeast system and subcellular localizations, we propose fates of paralogs of soybean pht <dig> were subfunctionalization. these results provided a strong basis for function analysis and evolution of gene families.

RESULTS
identification, phylogenetic relationship and promoters of soybean pht <dig> genes
fourteen soybean pht <dig> genes with full length sequence were found  <cit> . in addition, a syntenic analysis using the pgdd or coge databases identified one potential pseudogene , which had a truncated open reading frame length  of 444 bp. this potential pseudogene, which was determined to be masked, has not been previously identified  <cit> . for an unified nomenclature for the soybean pht1s , fifteen soybean pht <dig> genes were renamed as glyma;pht1; <dig> through glyma;pht1; <dig> according to the commission for plant gene nomenclature, and abbreviated as gmpht1; <dig> through  <dig> in the following content.

these  <dig> pht <dig> genes are dispersed across eight chromosomes and form  <dig> paralog gene pairs and one singleton . these paralog gene pairs shared  <dig>  ~  <dig> % in sequence  and similar gene structures . for example, both gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> have  <dig> exons, both gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> are composed of  <dig> exons, while the others only contain one. however, an extra intron in 5′-utrs of gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> was identified .

to identify the phylogenetic relationship of the soybean pht <dig> genes with full length sequence, a neighbor-joining tree was reconstructed based on the multiple sequence alignment . the pht <dig> family was monophyletic  <cit>  and can be grouped into four subfamilies in the angiosperm: the subfamily i is composed of pht <dig> genes induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi , subfamily ii genes are from both mono- and dicotyledonous species, subfamily iii are exclusively from dicotyledonous species, and subfamily iv are exclusively from monocotyledonous species  <cit> . furthermore, the subfamily ii was closely related to the homologs from the fungi by high bootstrap value , indicating it was present before the occurrence of terrestrial plant and an older evolutionary lineage. in the soybean, fourteen pht <dig> genes were clustered into three subfamilies: subfamily i, subfamily ii and subfamily iii   <cit> .

the paralog gene pair’s promoter region sequence similarities are lower than their cds sequences . many similar cis-acting regulatory dna elements, which are relative to the nodulin, root, flower, leaf, seed, abiotic or biotic stress, sugar and hormone , can be found in promoter regions of  <dig> pht <dig> genes according to the place results  <cit> . for example, the cis-elements relative to the root-specific  and nodule-specific  are present in  <dig> soybean pht <dig> promoters . except gmpht1; <dig> promoter, other soybean pht <dig> promoters contain phosphate starvation responsive cis-element . and gmpht1; <dig> promoter did not embody pibs motif but a variant pibs motif  . the differences in common cis-elements across these promoter regions include both their number and their distance from the starting code . that indicated the number of cis-elements and their distance from the transcription start sites affected response abilities of pht <dig> to the environment.

soybean pht <dig> genes originated from four ancestors prior to the gamma wgt event
the average synonymous substitution rate  of homologous blocks is a function of genomic evolutionary events that occurred since two homologous blocks diverged from a common ancestor  <cit> . the modern soybean genome has undergone gamma wgt , legume wgd  and glycine wgd   <cit> . to analyze the soybean pht gene duplication relationship, medicago truncatula, which experienced the gamma wgt event and legume wgd event  <cit> , was selected as the reference gene order and  <dig> medicago pht1s were identified .

based on the analysis of homologous genomic regions, seven paralog gmpht <dig> gene pairs fell into  <dig> syntenic blocks and diverged after the glycine wgd event. this was based on each pair of blocks having collinearity, with the average ks ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . although the paralog gene of gmpht1; <dig> was lost in the syntenic block of chromosome  <dig>  the block containing gmpht1; <dig> underwent glycine wgd events . because the homologous block containing mtpht <dig> on chromosome  <dig> in m. truncatula had a collinearity with the block harboring gmpht1; <dig> . with the exception of the wgd duplication, the ancestor of two paralog gene pairs, gmpht1;1/ <dig> and gmpht1;6/ <dig>  experienced tandem duplication before the legume wgd event. because the blocks embodying gmpht1;1/ <dig> and gmpht1;5/ <dig> had a collinearity with the block containing two tandem genes, mtpht <dig> and  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> of m. truncatula .

based on the average ks values for the homologous blocks , the evolution history of all  <dig> pht <dig> genes was predicted. these pht <dig> genes were categorized into four subgroups, gmpht1a through d . for example, gmpht1a included eight syntenic blocks, which represented five paralog gene pairs of pht <dig> genes, gmpht1;2/ <dig>  gmpht1;4/ <dig>  gmpht1;1/ <dig>  gmpht1;6/ <dig> and gmpht1;3/ <dig>  both gmpht1b and gmpht1c contained two syntenic blocks and each contained one paralog gene pair of pht <dig> genes, gmpht1;8/ <dig> and gmpht1;12/ <dig>  respectively. gmpht1d group was made up of two syntenic blocks and contained the gmpht1; <dig> gene. these results indicated the soybean pht <dig> gene family originates from four distinct ancestors, at least prior to the gamma wgt event.

divergence of gmpht <dig> expressions in different tissues and in developmental stages
duplicated genes typically exhibit increased expression divergence, thus gene expression changes shape evolutionary rates of proteins and re-establish the gene balance after duplication  <cit> . based on the spatio-temporal expression of gmpht <dig> genes through real time quantitative rt-pcr , most paralog gene pairs co-expressed in  <dig> tissues . however, two paralog gene pairs demonstrated obvious expression pattern differences. gmpht1; <dig>  was only expressed roots, but the expression of its paralog gene, gmpht1; <dig>  was detected at low level in all samples. and the gmpht1; <dig> paralog gene, gmpht1; <dig>  did not express in hypocotyls and epicotyls at the seedling stage.

the expression levels among paralog gene pairs demonstrated clear divergence . among the six paralog gene pairs,  <dig> pairs of co-expression values were obtained from  <dig> tissues. the overall expression levels difference were as follows, ~24% had between a  <dig> to  <dig> fold change, ~ 54% between a  <dig> -to  <dig> fold change, and ~ 22% had more than a 10-fold change. moreover, gene-biased expression levels between a paralog gene pair were observed. for example, one paralog gene pair, gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> displayed expression biased to gmpht1; <dig> in  <dig> tissues, only different in the pods after  <dig> fad. in addition, expressions were biased to gmpht1; <dig> between the paralog gene pair, gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> .

gmpht <dig> genes differential response to the pi stress
plant root performance dependents directly on pi availability in soil  <cit> . pi stress induces most of the known pht1s genes . to investigate gmpht <dig> responses under low pi  stress conditions, soybean pht <dig> gene expressions were evaluated in the root, stem and leaf, at the vegetative stage . compared with expressions under high pi  conditions, all soybean pht <dig> genes were up-regulated in roots under the low pi condition. divergent expressions of some paralogs were observed in stem or leaf tissues . except gmpht1; <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  transcriptions of other soyben pht <dig> genes were down-regulated in stems under low pi conditions. additionally, expressions of gmpht1; <dig> and  <dig> were induced by the high pi condition in leaves.

in addition to under the low pi condition, the responses of gmpht <dig> genes to a series of pi concentrations in the roots were employed to investigate the expression divergence of the paralog gene pairs . compared with those under the low pi  condition, expressions of all  <dig> gmpht <dig> genes were significantly supressed in the roots under the pi = 10 μm condition except gmpht1; <dig>  and when the external pi concentration was more than 10 μm, the range of expressions were very narrow except gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig>  that indicated most paralog gene pairs showed the similar responses to the external pi in the root except gmpht1;2/ <dig> and gmpht1;3/ <dig>  and under the high-pi condition, the transcriptions of gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> were induced, but the strength were lower than under the low pi condition . that suggested that gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> may contributed to pi tolerance in soybean.

divergence in the pi transport activities of gmpht <dig> in yeast
to investigate the divergence of  <dig> soybean pht1s in the pi transport ability, the abilities of heterologous complementation of yeast double mutant   <cit>  were tested on the nutrition defect media . the resulting sequences were confirmed by sequencing and cloned into pyes-dest <dig> drive by gal <dig> promoter.

as figure  <dig> shown, only one paralog gene pairs, gmpht1;6/ <dig>  showed difference of complementation ability. and pam <dig> cells carrying gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig>  and gmpht1; <dig> grew well on the induced modified sd media  under the low pi condition, whereas pam <dig> cells harboring other  <dig> gmpht <dig> and the empty vector did not grow normally under the same conditions. this data suggested that gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig>  gmpht1; <dig>  and gmpht1; <dig> may be high-affinity phosphate transporters and others were lower-affinity ones.

kinetic parameters  can display the affinity ability of the pht <dig> proteins for transporting pi. subsequent 32pi uptake assays were employed to further confirm the different affinity of gmpht <dig> and to analyze km values of pi uptake of  <dig> paralogous pair transporters . the paralogous gene pairs also displayed divergence on the affinity for pi. for example, gmpht1; <dig> had a km of  <dig>  μm, while its papralogous transporter gmpht1; <dig> had a km of  <dig>  μm; the km of gmpht1; <dig> was  <dig>  μm, whereas the km of gmpht1; <dig> was  <dig>  μm, both of them were low affinity transporters.

divergence on the subcellular localization of gmpht <dig> proteins
the pht <dig> protein in plants primarily localizes to the plasma membrane  <cit> . under pi stress they are targeted to endocytic compartments  <cit> . to analyze subcellular localization of gmpht <dig> proteins, we tagged the gmpht <dig> proteins with yellow fluorescence protein  at their c-terminal. with the exception of gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig>  twelve gmpht <dig> proteins co-localized to the plasma membrane .

one exceptional case was the localization pattern of gmpht1; <dig>  though no fluorescent signal of gmpht1;8-yfp was detected in the plasma membrane , a strong signals in endoplasmic reticulum  was detected. gmpht1; <dig> co-localized to the er in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts along with er-marker  <cit>  .

another exception was gmpht1; <dig> localization. here, gmpht1; <dig> fluorescent signals were detected both at the plasma membrane as well as outside of the plasma membrane . these localization patterns were recapitulated in plasmolytic onion epidermal cells. strong fluorescence was detected in cell walls, plasma membranes and hechtian strands . moreover, paralog gene, gmpht1; <dig>  and another gene pair, gmpht1; <dig> and  <dig>  presented with strong signals only in the plasma membrane . this pattern was a copy of that found in medicago mtpt <dig>  <cit>  and arabidopsis pht1; <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
different lineages of pht <dig> genes undergoing different nature selections during the plant evolutionary process
land plants only gain phosphorous from soil solutions through the root, and most pht <dig> genes express and are induced by the pi starvation or by amf in the root  <cit> , indicating pi uptake is heavily dependent on the phosphate transporter  <dig> family in the plant. in order to adapt the low-pi environment and improve pi uptake, two pi uptake pathways have evolved under the nature selection. first, the direct pi acquisition pathway acts through modifications of root architecture, root length and lateral root numbers  <cit> . the second pathway is symbiotic pi uptake, which acts through plant/fungi interactions  <cit> .

before the occurrence of the first terrestrial plant, which were present about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , the pht <dig> subfamily ii has been divergent based on the phylogenic tree , indicating the direct pi acquisition pathway was the main pi acquisition pathway of ancient plants. about  <dig> million years ago, amf occurred and may have played a crucial role in facilitating the colonization of land by plants most likely only consisted of plants on the bryophytic level  <cit> . and then the pht <dig> subfamily i was diverged, suggesting the subfamily i is another older evolutionary lineage. therefore, amf have been symbionts of land plants for at least  <dig> million years old, and the symbiotic pi uptake is an evolutionarily ancient pi acquisition strategy for plant life on land  <cit> .

in the evolutionary process of plants, genome duplications were ancient and recurrent  <cit> . they provide the important raw genetic material to adapt to challenging environment and increase the diversity of plants. new genome sequences and improved analytical approaches are clarifying angiosperm evolution and revealing patterns of differential gene loss after genome duplication and differential gene retention associated with evolution of some morphological complexity  <cit> . according to the evolution of the pht <dig> family, the members of pht <dig> subfamily i and ii, which are diverged eailier, were not expanded as expected in angiosperms compared with the subfamily iii and iv. for example, in arabidopsis, which is not host plant of amf and experienced at least three polyploidy events  <cit> , nine members of the pht <dig> family were found, but no members of pht <dig> subfamily i  <cit> . in populus trichocarpa, experiencing at least two polyploidy events  <cit> , ptpt <dig> and ptpt <dig> belong to the pht <dig> subfamily i, and ptpt <dig> is a pseudogene  <cit> . in the rice, experiencing one polyploidy event  <cit> , contain two nonredundant members of the pht <dig> subfamily i, ospt <dig> and ospt <dig> <cit> . and ospt <dig> is conserved and special across monocotyledons  <cit> . in the soybean, undergoing three wgd events  <cit> , three members of the pht <dig> subfamily i, gmpht1; <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were found. gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig>  were a paralog gene pair arisen after the glycine wgd event. and the gmpht1; <dig> paralog gene was lost after the legume wgd event and then gmpht1; <dig> became a singleton . conversely, the gmpht1-a experienced three rounds of wgd events and is composed of  <dig> members with whole coding sequences, plus one pseudogene . for the pht <dig> subfamily ii, about two members can be found in each plants, while members of subfamily iii or iv were expanded after gene duplication . taken together, different selection pressures retained different subgroups during the plant evolution.

multiple divergences resulted in retention of paralogs from one gene family
polyploidy is widespread and is a process that recurrently shaped eukaryotic genomes in plant. after genome duplication once fixed within species, the three possible fates of duplicated genes: neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization or nonfunctionalization  <cit> . if the ka/ks value is more than  <dig> , gene copies would undergo positive selection and have new functions. on the contrary, subfunctionalization would be expected to undergo purifying selection. the ka/ks values for all soybean pht <dig> genes were less than  <dig>  , thus, the paralog pht <dig> gene pairs were undergoing purifying selections in the soybean evolution and subfunctionalized. in the soybean genome, about 75% genes are present in multiple copies, and approximately 50% of paralogs are differentially expressed and have undergone expression subfunctionalization, and only a small proportion of the duplicated genes have been neofunctionalized or non-functionalized  <cit> , suggesting that the main fate of duplicated genes were subfunctionalization.

although the different functions of pi transport were that they have different affinities, all the published pht <dig> genes display conserved functions of pi transport. in one species, the greatest difference is the divergence of their expression profile, which results in their differently functional sites in the plant. in arabidospsis, atpht1; <dig> expresses only in flowers, and both atpht1; <dig> and  <dig> express only in the roots  <cit> , and transcriptions of atpht1; <dig> are detected in the old tissues and induced by ethylene  <cit> . additionally, most atpht <dig> genes exhibit strong expression in several tissues although their expressions overlapped to some extent  <cit> . in angiosperms, some members of the pht <dig> family, such as mtpt <dig>  ospt <dig>  ospt <dig>  tapht <dig>  hvpt <dig>  stpt <dig>  lept <dig> and ptpt <dig>  are induced only by amf, while transcriptions of other members, such as stpt <dig>  ospt <dig>  ospt <dig>  ospt <dig>  ospt <dig>  ospt <dig>  and ospt <dig> are not special to amf  <cit> . the response of most pht <dig> genes to the low pi are similar, but to deficiencies of other nutrient elements, such as nitrogen, potassium, iron, and zinc, are different  <cit> . three different paralog gene pairs, show different expression patterns or levels under deficient n, k, or fe conditions  <cit> , suggesting another subfunctionalization event among these paralogs.

subfunctionalization can be taken as genetic redundancy  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis, the pi uptake rates of single mutants, pht1; <dig> and pht1; <dig>  were reduced about 20%, but the rate of double mutant was reduced approximately 57%, under the low-pi condition  <cit> . mutations in tomato  stpt <dig> affected neither mycorrhizal pi uptake nor establishment of the symbiotic pathway, this was due to arbuscular-mycorrhizal symbiosis triggering expression of other three pht <dig> genes  <cit> . these results indicate pi uptake functionally redundancy. the expression profiles of soybean pht <dig> , indicates extensively overlaid, these results suggest redundancy in these paralogs as well.

pht <dig>  as a plasma membrane protein, consists of two regions of six transmembrane domains separated by a hydrophilic loop  <cit> . all the  <dig> soybean pht <dig> proteins, like other pht1s, contain  <dig> transmembrane domains . up to now, the pht <dig> family members were believed to localize finally to the plasma membrane  after post-translational modifications  <cit> . according to our results , the fluorescence signals of most soybean pht1s were detected in the plasma membrane. except the plasma membrane, the fluorescence signals of mtpt <dig>  <cit>  and atpht1; <dig>  <cit>  can be detected in hechtian strands. the subcellular localization of gmpht1; <dig> in onion epidermal cells was similar to that of mtpt <dig> and atpht1; <dig> , but the same localization pattern was not observed in its paralog . interestingly, the localization of gmpht1; <dig> was not at the cytoplasmic membrane but at the endoplasmic reticulum , however its paralog, gmpht1; <dig>  localized to the plasma membrane.

subfunctionalization of paralogs beneficial to soybean pi uptake, translocation and remobilization
to enhance acquisition of external pi, plants can morphologically regulate root architecture to enhance the root surface/soil volume ratio, also root architecture is closely related to p efficiency  <cit> . the number and length of lateral roots and the length of primary roots increased under the low-pi condition . at the molecular level, the members of pht <dig> family play important roles in pi uptake from soil solutions thus exhibiting robust expression in roots  <cit> . according to our results  and others’  <cit> , fourteen soybean pht <dig> genes expressed in the root were up-regulated by low-pi stress. moreover, gmpht1; <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had high affinity to pi. thus, gmpht1; <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> may play important roles in the direct pi uptake from low-pi soil solutions.

in addition to direct pi uptake, symbiotic phosphate uptake is an ancestral pi acquisition strategy for plants, meaning that some pht <dig> genes are induced by arbuscular mycorrhizas  <cit> . in the soybean, the transcription of three soybean pht <dig> genes, gmpt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , was induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . these results indicate these three genes have important roles in soybean symbiotic pi uptake.

after pi uptake, distribution and remobilization of pi, within the plant, is accomplished through the membrane transport systems of the shoots to the sink tissues wherever symplastic connections are lost  <cit> . although other pht gene families, such as the pht <dig> family  <cit> , are involved the process, the pht <dig> gene family localization in the plasma membrane is the most important  <cit> . based on our results, gmpht1; <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exhibited stronger expression than their corresponding paralog genes in the stems, at the seedling and flowering stage , suggesting involvement in internal pi transport in the shoots.

another developmental signal, senescence, has been reported to strongly induced expression of some pht <dig> genes  <cit> , and most leaf phosphorus is remobilized to the seed during reproductive development in soybean  <cit> . for instance, in other plants, the expression of phpt <dig> is up regulated during petunia petal senescence  <cit>  and transcript level of pht1; <dig> is elevated in the old leaves in arabidopsis <cit> . in the soybean, gmpht1; <dig> expression increased in unifoliolates along with developmental process and reached the peak during flowering time . moreover, again during flowering time, the transcription level of gmpht1; <dig> was relative to leaf ages .this suggests that gmpht1; <dig> is related to the re-utilization of pi from older leaves. cotyledons are the main phosphorus store tissue and the phosphorus resource tissue at the seedling stage. high expression of gmpht1; <dig> was detected in the cotyledons at the seedling stage , suggesting gmpht1; <dig> played an important roles in recycling pi from cotyledons.

different subcellular localizations of gmpht <dig> proteins correlated to cellular homeostasis according to our findings. although the majority of gmpht <dig> proteins localized on cytoplasma membrane , similarly to pht1s in other plants  <cit> , gmpht1; <dig> and gmpht1; <dig> have unique localization patterns. gmpht1; <dig> localized to hechtian strands in addition to the cytoplasma membrane and cell walls. these hechtian transporters may play critical roles in pi transport between the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall or between cells  <cit> . perhaps, gmpht1; <dig> had important roles in the cross talk of pi flux or signals amongst the cells. in addition, gmpht1; <dig> localized, exclusively, to the endomembrane system instead of cytoplasma membrane . a functional auxin transporter, atpin <dig>  does not have a direct role in cell-to-cell transport but regulates intracellular auxin homeostasis and localizes to endoplasmic reticulum , unlike other characterized plasma membrane pin proteins  <cit> . given the function of the atpin <dig>  this result may indicate gmpht1; <dig> has a role in regulating intracellular pi homeostasis and metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
in the soybean, there were  <dig> pht <dig> genes with full whole cds plus one pseudogene, and they originated from four different different ancestors, gmpht1a, b, c and d, before the gamma wgt events in the soybean evolution history. three polyploidy events expanded the members of gmpht1a. in addition, one tandem duplication also increased the members of gmpht1a after the legume wgd and before the glycine wgd. the retentions of paralog genes of gmpht1b and c were only after the glycine wgd. gmpht1d contained one member, of which paralog gene was lost. fourteen soybean pht1s underwent the purifying selection and had the conserved function in pi uptake although they had different affinities for pi, and gmpht1; <dig> experienced pseudogenization. expression divergence levels were the main style of subfunctionalization of the paralog gene pairs. the expression ratios were more than two amongst paralog gene pairs in about 76% co-expression tissues. although  <dig> soybean pht <dig> genes more strongly expressed in the roots under the low pi condition, the response extent were different. similar subcelluar localizations to the plasma membrane were found amongst most soybean pht <dig> proteins. but gmpht1; <dig> was not localized to the plasma membrane but to the endoplasmic reticulum, while gmpht1; <dig> was localized to hechtian strands in addition to plasma membranes.
