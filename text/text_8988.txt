BACKGROUND
cell-free protein synthesis  is widely used for the production of in vivo cytotoxic, regulatory, or unstable proteins that are difficult to express in living cells  <cit>  and for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into protein polypeptides  <cit> . also, cfps can be applied for high-throughput screening of target proteins  <cit> , functional tool for proteomics  <cit> , and the development of point-of-care medicines  <cit> . also, cfps is the fastest method to produce a desired protein within one day  <cit> .

protein synthesis is an energy-intensive process. the primary energy source atp is regenerated from the secondary energy source through substrate phosphorylation in cfps  <cit> . common secondary energy compounds such as creatine phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate , acetate phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate , 3-phosphoglycerate, and fructose- <dig> -biphosphate, contain high-energy phosphate bonds for regenerating atp. consequently, atp regeneration accompanied with the consumption of phosphate-containing substrate leads to an increase in inorganic phosphate. high concentrations of inorganic phosphate severely impair protein biosynthesis, likely due to precipitation of free magnesium ions  <cit> . magnesium ions are essentially important for nucleoside triphosphate synthesis, protein translation, and translation termination  <cit> .

in order to mitigate the accumulation of free phosphate, swartz and his coworkers have studied the replacement of costly phosphate-containing secondary energy compounds by using phosphate-free secondary energy compounds   <cit> . pyruvate, an end product of glycolysis, coupled with the pediococcus sp. pyruvate oxidase, catalase, and acetate kinase to produce one atp per pyruvate without accumulation of phosphate can be used for long-time cfps  <cit> . further improvements in utilizing glucose through the glycolytic pathway to acetate and lactate have been achieved for more efficient atp regeneration  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that glucose and g6p can produce two and three atp, respectively, through glycolysis to pyruvate. extra atp can be produced through the panox system with addition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  and coenzyme a  that help convert pyruvate to acetate and lactate. in addition, glucose as the secondary energy source is much less expensive than any phosphate-containing compounds or phosphate-free pyruvate  <cit> .

in addition to the effects of phosphate and the costs of a secondary energy source, stable ph is vital for high protein yields  <cit> . it is well known that well-controlled continuous cfps systems have high protein yields  <cit> . but continuous cfps systems with complicated configurations are hard to scale up for high-throughput applications and are not efficient for utilizing costly reagents  <cit> . it would be appealing to use slowly-metabolized secondary energy sources in batch reactions, which likely mimic the well-controlled continuous reactions.

in this study, to avoid phosphate accumulation and to maintain a relatively homeostatic reaction environment for cfps, we designed a novel atp regeneration system starting from low-cost maltodextrin and ending with acetate and lactate, by using a combination of maltodextrin phosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase, glycolysis, and the pnaox system.

RESULTS
a new atp regeneration pathway
the atp regeneration scheme was designed to involve maltodextrin phosphorolysis, glycolysis, and panox pathway . maltodextrin was slowly cleaved into glucose-1-phosphate  in the presence of inorganic phosphate catalyzed by maltodextrin phosphorylase . g1p was further converted into g6p by phosphoglucomutase . the g6p generation rate from maltodextrin can be controlled by the amounts of the added maltodextrin phosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase. we tested the effects of maltodextrin phosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase loading on the est <dig> yields. without addition of maltodextrin phosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase, the est <dig> expression levels by e. coli cell extract plus maltodextrin were very low . the optimal enzyme additions were found to be  <dig>  u of maltodextrin phosphorylase and  <dig>  u of phosphoglucomutase per  <dig> μl of the reaction solution. three moles of atp can be generated per mole of g6p through the glycolytic pathway . the panox system can convert two molecules of pyruvate to lactate and acetate plus one atp .

   

   

   

   

the overall pathway as designed can generate four atp per glucose equivalent of maltodextrin .

   

synthesis of esterase
esterase  <dig>  from alicyclobacillus acidocaldorius, a  <dig> kda protein, was chosen as a reporter protein for in vitro protein synthesis  <cit> . figure 2a shows the profiles of the synthesized active protein est <dig> energized by maltodextrin, glucose, pep, and g6p, respectively. the reaction energized by maltodextrin had the highest protein level, at  <dig>  mg est <dig> per ml, higher than the other compounds . est <dig> activity staining on polyacrylamide gel was used to analyze the synthesized proteins after sds-page separation   <cit> . the est <dig> activity staining helps locating est <dig> from a high background of other proteins  <cit> . the quantitative results based on the est <dig> enzyme activity suggested that using maltodextrin as a secondary energy source for cell-free protein synthesis produced more est <dig> than the other three energy sources.

changes in ph were measured during the protein synthesis process . at the beginning, the initial phs for the four reactions were around ph  <dig> – <dig> . the ph from the reactions energized by maltodextrin, pep, glucose and g6p decreased slowly to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  after one hour, respectively, and then levelled off. the reaction energized by maltodextrin exhibited the least ph fluctuation, from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

concentrations of atp in the reaction mixtures were measured during the process of protein synthesis . in the case of maltodextrin, the atp level decreased slowly; its levels remained above  <dig>  mm for the first two hours. in the case of pep, the atp level was highest at the beginning, quickly decreased from  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm, and then levelled off. pep was an easily metabolized substrate, resulting in higher levels of atp as compared to other slowly-metabolized substrates of maltodextrin, g6p, and glucose. the measured atp concentration was the combinatorial result of continuous in situ atp regeneration and atp consumption for protein synthesis and nonproductive hydrolysis. recently, it was found that cfps had a low atp binding constant   <cit> , suggesting that atp levels in cfps  were saturated, i.e., the protein synthesis rates did not depend on the atp levels  <cit> .

synthesis of cbm-gfp and xylose reductase
two other proteins  were investigated for cfps energized by maltodextrin, glucose, pep, and g6p, respectively. figure  <dig> shows that the final cbm-gfp and xylose reductase concentrations are  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg per ml, respectively, when maltodextrin was used as secondary energy source. these values were higher than those powered by pep, g6p and glucose but the comparative advantages depended on the protein type. slowly metabolized, low-cost maltodextrin may be a good secondary energy source for cfps without the need for intensive optimization.

discussion
cfps energized by maltodextrin presented relatively high levels of est <dig>  cbm-gfp and xylose reductase as compared with three other secondary energy sources – glucose, g6p, and pep. maltodextrin provided relatively homeostatic conditions, such as no phosphate accumulation and less fluctuation in ph . slowly metabolized maltodextrin in batch cfps was somewhat like continuous cfps with regard to well-controlled reaction conditions.

the major advantages of using slowly-metabolized maltodextrin are to avoid inorganic phosphate accumulation to inhibitory levels and to maintain a relatively homeostatic environment  for protein synthesis. proper levels of inorganic phosphate are also required for effective synthesis of nucleoside triphosphate  from nucleoside diphosphate  for high level protein synthesis  <cit> . using phosphate-free maltodextrin does not release net phosphate. in contrast, it can decrease free phosphate levels by substrate phosphorylation and keep phosphate levels nearly constant. in addition, maltodextrin is not a substrate of e. coli endogenous phosphatases. therefore, the challenge associated with non-productive hydrolysis of phosphate-containing compounds  <cit>  has been partially addressed by using maltodextrin.

the importance of ph control in cfps has long been recognized  <cit> . more stable ph in the case of maltodextrin was largely attributed to no phosphate accumulation and less formation of organic acids  due to the generation of more atp per substrate consumed . the latter speculation has been validated by product assays, in which  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm lactate were produced from glucose, maltodextrin and pep, respectively, after a  <dig> hour reaction. swartz and his coworkers also reported that a strong ph-capacity buffer  increased protein synthesis levels  <cit> .

est <dig> was used as a major model protein for cfps in this study. due to its high-sensitivity and thermal stability, it had been applied not only for cfps  <cit>  but also for detecting nucleic acid hybridization  <cit> . since est <dig> has a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg based on p-nitrophenylbutyrate at 25°c  <cit> , its levels can be measured as low as  <dig> pm, superior to 14c radioactivity-labelled amino acids. we also used the roche high-yield in vitro protein synthesis system as a control to express est <dig> protein at a level of  <dig>  mg per ml. the previous est <dig> levels by cfps were  <dig> – <dig>  mg per ml  <cit> . the expression level  energized by maltodextrin was the highest so far.

a number of secondary energy substrates were compared based on their atp yields and phosphate release . acetyl-phosphate, creatine-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate , and pep generated one atp and released one inorganic phosphate  <cit> . atp regeneration potential through the panox system was approximately one atp per two pyruvate with an acetate/lactate = ~1: <dig>  in principle, one molecule of glucose, g6p and fructose- <dig>  6-biphosphate can regenerate three, four and five molecules of atp and release zero, one and two phosphate, respectively. one glucose equivalent of maltodextrin can produce four molecules of atp, while it does not release phosphate . maltodextrin is better than glucose because generation of g1p mediated by glucan phosphorylases from polysaccharides does not consume atp so that one molecule of atp is saved from glucose phosphorylation catalyzed by atp-dependent hexokinase  <cit> . it is well known that atp consumption of cfps is not coupled to atp regeneration  <cit> , which is different from in vivo protein synthesis  <cit> . but slowly-metabolized maltodextrin can enhance the protein synthesis yield and decrease energy dissipation because they can avoid an initial high concentration of the secondary energy compound, most of which was hydrolyzed by e. coli endogenous phosphatases. for example, approximately 70% of  <dig> mm pep was hydrolyzed within the first  <dig> min by endogenous phosphatase in the e. coli cell extract  <cit> .

in addition to the high product levels associated with more homeostatic conditions, maltodextrin is a low-cost substrate. the secondary energy compound cost accounts for a significant fraction of total cfps cost  <cit> . for example, pep costs $ <dig>  per ml of reaction mixture , while glucose and maltodextrin cost only $ <dig>  and $ <dig>  per ml of reaction mixture, respectively, based on sigma-aldrich prices. although a small amount of maltodextrin phosphorylase  and phosphoglucomutase  added some extra costs for the entire systems, two over-expressed recombinant enzymes in e. coli were produced and used in this study  <cit> . it is anticipated that costs of supplementary enzymes will be decreased to very low levels. the use of maltodextrin in cfps can not only dramatically decrease the cost of secondary energy but also increase synthesized protein levels.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of maltodextrin as a secondary energy source for cell-free protein synthesis was shown to synthesize proteins with several advantages: relatively high protein synthesis, no phosphate accumulation, little change in ph, and low cost. the slowly generated g1p from maltodextrin followed by glycolysis provided relatively homeostatic cfps environments.
