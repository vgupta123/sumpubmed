BACKGROUND
in the past decade, the focus of genomic diversity studies mainly included single nucleotide polymorphisms  and short tandem repeats  in humans as well as in other organisms. more recently, the international hapmap project directed efforts toward understanding haplotype structure in human populations and helped to form our perception of genomic diversity based on snps  <cit> . at the same time, olson and varki  <cit>  argued that understanding our own genome would not be complete without the evolutionary perspective, and requires knowledge of the genomes of our closest primate relatives  <cit> . previously, direct comparisons of human and chimpanzee sequences have used either a single chromosome  <cit>  or the entire genomes  <cit> . resulting extensive sequence datasets opened a possibility for carefully examining alternative sources of genomic variation, such as insertions and deletions .

since humans diverged from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , understanding genome differences between these two lineages is critically important for defining our own species. several studies that examined chimpanzee and human genomes comparatively, located and characterised sequence differences, including single-base pair indels, monomeric and multi-base pair extensions , indels with random dna sequences, and transposon insertions  <cit> ; and more are currently under way. initially, differences between humans and chimpanzees were estimated at 1%  <cit> , but later this number was refined to  <dig> %  <cit> . several studies pointed out that the number of differences is much higher when indels  are included in the comparison  <cit> , and the total divergence may be as high as  <dig> %  <cit> . removing repeats and low-complexity dna reduces this calculation to  <dig> %  <cit> , doubling the original estimates.

indels, fragments missing in sequence comparisons between individuals or closely related species, are plentiful across genomes  <cit> . only a small fraction of indels occurs within coding sequences; it seems that these may play a key role in primate evolution  <cit> . while most indels have no adaptive value, some are known to alter important functions, and many are known to be involved in disease phenotypes  <cit> . it has been noted that while the human genome might contain as many as  <dig> – <dig>  million indel polymorphisms, efforts directed toward the discovery of this type of genomic variants are still significantly less intensive than efforts involved in the snp discovery  <cit> . many indel polymorphisms can still be discovered and classified in comparative genomic studies.

as the number of described indels accumulates, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain their source and existence. the origin of individual indels seems to depend on their size, sequence context as well as other factors  <cit> . for example, it appears that many recent short insertions in the human genome originated as tandem duplications, while smaller indels  were generated either by unequal crossing over or by replication slippage  <cit> . in addition, a non-homologous end joining mechanism initiated by a double-strand breakage  <cit>  has also been proposed as a main mechanism of indel generation for a wide range of sizes  <cit> .

in this study, we report on those indels  that cannot be simply explained by short tandem repeats and/or other repetitive dna occurrence. we obtained a set of indels by comparing homologous sections of human and chimpanzee chromosome  <dig> , and characterized it relative to the local, chromosomal, genomic, and gene-specific sequence contexts. we divided our data into three groups  according to presence, sequence identity, and relative locations of additional copies of indel sequence in the neighboring  region. we also considered the observed indels in their genomic context and further divided the data into three groups  based on the presence of copies locally on chromosome  <dig> or elsewhere in the human genome. the presence of indels in coding sequences of genes and other genomic elements was examined relative to the random expectation using a tenfold chromosome-wide resampling approach. finally, we examined predicted transcripts for their impacts on peptide sequence to confirm genes where an insertion or deletion can change the amino acid sequence or alternate splice products that differentiate between the two species. indels that impacted genes by altering coding sequences and splice sites were further characterized. gene impacts were considered both computationally, by looking at the resulting amino acid sequence, and by direct sequencing, in comparison among five human populations and with five closely related primate species.

RESULTS
identification and analysis of indels
we identified  <dig>  indels  in a comparison between  <dig> mb of syntenic regions from human and chimpanzee chromosome  <dig>  using human genome as a reference ). human sequence extended from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb while the chimpanzee sequence covered a region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb . most of these variants were found around simple sequence repeats , but similar numbers were located in and around the known repetitive dna sequences  and were filtered out . for simplicity, throughout this paper we refer to the data set containing the remaining  <dig>  repeat-filtered sequences as the "observed" dataset. in addition, we also generated a tenfold random resampled dataset of fragments of human chromosome  <dig> with distribution of lengths identical to those of the previously described observed dataset ). we will refer to this artificially generated data set and the "indels" it contains as "resampled," and consider it as the baseline expectation in our subsequent statistical analysis.

a total of  <dig>  indels of size ≥  <dig> bp were seen in comparison of human and chimpanzee chromosomes  <dig>  most of these were either in short tandem repeats  or known repetitive dnas, where the major types are shown. the remaining indels  were classified as insertions or deletions relative to the human sequence. another  <dig> % of the indels were 2– <dig> bp . in addition,  <dig>  single nucleotide differences were seen in the ucsc alignment totalling  <dig> % of the bases compared.

identification and characterization of genomic context and core indel types
indels in the observed dataset were classified according to their local or genome-wide repetitive nature. both datasets  were divided into three core classes based on local structure analysis:  those found uniquely in the  <dig> kb indel-harbouring region were marked as "unique" ,  those with at least one exact copy found locally were categorized as "exact" , and  those with similar but not identical copies of the core indel sequence found locally were labelled as "approximate" . in addition, we divided the observed dataset into three genome classes according to the presence and location of additional copies of sequences in the human genome ). a group of indels whose exact sequences  were unique to their genome location were the most common , followed by the group of indels with copies present elsewhere, but exclusively on chromosome  <dig> . there was also a small fraction of indels whose copies were also identified on other chromosomes of the human genome, outside of chromosome  <dig> . our subsequent analysis was based on comparisons among genome or core classes of intels, as well as on contrasting between the observed data and the baseline provided by the tenfold resampled dataset.

indels from the three core classes  were not represented equally among the three genome classes  ). we identified a significant excess of approximate and exact indels at the expense of unique indels in the observed dataset  χ <dig> =  <dig>   <dig> d.f., p <  <dig> ; table s <dig> and fig. 2). the majority of genome-unique indels had copies locally and were classified as approximate core indels  reflecting their locally repetitive nature ). most chromosome-unique indels were also found in the approximate core class . at the same time, the unique core indels  were better represented among the genome-unique   compared to the chromosome-unique indels   ).

characterization of core indel classes among and within genic features
the locations of  <dig>  observed and  <dig>  expected indels were assessed in relation to refseq genes annotated on chromosome  <dig> and assigned into five gene element categories:  intergenic sequence, sequences located  upstream and  downstream of known genes,  functional gene elements, and  introns . the observed frequency distribution of indels among these five gene element categories was not random . indels were less frequent immediately upstream  and downstream  of the genes, and in functional regions of genes . most of the observed indels were found either in introns and intergenic regions . the overall distribution of the three indel core classes among the five categories also differed from the distribution of the resampled dataset , largely due to fewer approximate indels located within genes than expected ).

indels located within genes were divided into five more categories according to the type of functional gene elements as located in:  promoters,  coding sequence,  splicing sites,  3' gene flanking regions, and  untranslated regions  . three of the five gene functional elements – promoter sites, splice sites, and coding regions – contained fewer observed indels than expected ). at the same time, slightly more indels than expected were found within the utrs and 3' flanking regions .

the three core classes of indels differed in their proximity to genes estimated as a distance to the boundary of the nearest exon ): approximate indels were found furthest away from genes , followed by the unique , and exact  categories ). the observed distribution of distances between indels and genes differed among indel core classes, and between the observed and the resampled data ). in the observed dataset, unique indels were located closer to coding sequences than approximate indels ). those unique indels found within introns were, on average, closer to exons than expected ). additionally, both approximate and unique indels, within the functional gene elements were on average twice as far from exons than expected ), and overall, observed indels were found further away from gene elements than expected .

length and distance to the nearest exon differences among the indel types
a comparison of indel lengths ). a and among the three core classes and across gene elements was performed. approximate indels, making up the largest core class, were shorter in length in the observed compared to the resampled dataset ). unique and exact indels were similar in size, and both contained indels that were on average smaller than their counterparts in the approximate class ). observed indels located within genes were the shortest , shorter than that expected from the resampled distribution ). approximate indels showed the greatest difference in size within gene elements ), while their presence in other categories, such as introns and intergenic elements, had no effect on length ). unique indels were shorter than expected overall, but the most significant differences between observed and expected length were found among those unique indels located outside genes, rather than within gene elements ).

evaluation of the observed indel impacts on gene structure
using a comparative approach, we reconstructed indel fragments within the human sequence that potentially impacted genes, and evaluated them either by deleting insertions or by adding deletion sequences . among the  <dig> indels identified in coding exons or in splice sites,  <dig> had potential impact on protein products: seven resulted in truncated proteins, two caused short insertions of amino acids, and one resulted in an amino acid substitution in eight impacted genes: celsr <dig>  flj <dig>  flj <dig>  nefh, rutbc <dig>  smc1l <dig>  tcf <dig>  and unc84b <dig> . the inferred ancestral state of each indel was based on whether the species interrogated in the laboratory had an insertion or a deletion relative to the known primate phylogenies . the other  <dig> predicted indels observed in acsin, bcr, brd <dig>  chkb, cyp2d7p <dig>  dgcr <dig>  pcqap, prodh, rutbc <dig>  sbf <dig>  selo, and zdhhc <dig> genes, had no effect on the predicted coding sequence .

along with the computational evaluation, the gene impacting indels were also examined by direct pcr and sequencing, using primers from conserved flanking sequences. the presence of an insertion or deletion was then examined by pcr amplification in  <dig> samples from five human populations , as well as  <dig> chimpanzees,  <dig> bonobos, nine gorillas and  <dig> individuals from two subspecies of orangutans . products were sized on agarose gels to identify polymorphisms and species differences in these indel loci. when different-sized fragments were present in at least one of the five species, the indel-containing region was sequenced .

with the use of genscan, the  <dig> indels found in coding exons or in splice site regions of the human refseq genes were analyzed for their impact to these genes. out of the  <dig>   <dig> of these indels impact genes through truncation/insertion of amino acids or substitution within a protein. the other  <dig> indels had no affect on the proteins generated from genes dgcr <dig>  zdhhc <dig>  brd <dig>  selo, sbf <dig>  chkb, pcqap, bcr, prodh, rutbc <dig>  cyp2d7p <dig>  &acsin <dig>  in order to confirm the presence of an insertion or a deletion, the loci and its harboring regions were sequenced in each of the species. assembly confirmation is dependent on whether the indel product is completely present  in the corresponding species predicted. for gene flj <dig>  the indel was present in its entirety. the assembly was also confirmed for genes smc1l <dig> and flj <dig> with all of the bases of the indel present, however additional sequence was also detected. the inferred ancestral state of each indel is based on whether a species has the insertion or deletion of that locus and the species' position on the phylogenetic tree.

**indel verified and additional sequence is present

the results of the laboratory validation varied among indels. for instance, in the flj <dig> gene, the human insertion was present in its entirety and led to the truncation of the protein from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . predicted indels were found and their impacts confirmed for genes smc1l <dig> and flj <dig> also. however, in flj <dig> an additional sequence that is not present in the reference sequence  was also detected. the unc84b sequencing yielded an incomplete fragment of the predicted indel. one of the sites in the rutbc <dig> genes was amplified, but with an indel different from the human draft sequence. dna amplified from another site within rutbc <dig> and one in tcf <dig> did not show any detectable differences in pcr fragment size in the different species. computationally predicted indels within nefh were additionally corroborated by human traces alignments . in the experimental validation, only one of the sites at nefh was successfully amplified with the indel size and sequence as predicted. the regions containing other indel site at nefh and indel within celsr <dig> did not amplify, despite numerous attempts.

discussion
indels that differentiate between humans and chimpanzees likely contribute to the speciation process  <cit>  of these closely related species. in the current analysis, a comprehensive evaluation of insertion/deletion variations between human and chimpanzee chromosome  <dig> was performed. upon examination,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  indels were found in genomic areas free of known repetitive dna and strs on chromosome  <dig> , and these were examined with respect to their structure, length, and location relative to known structural gene elements, and also the number, sequence similarity, and the location of the additional copies. we compared observed distributions of different indel classes to the baseline distribution of an expected set generated by a tenfold resampling approach , as well as among one another. we also developed a framework for analysis of local repetitive structure around indels. our results support the observation that indels have had a key role in primate evolution and contribute to important genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees  <cit> .

many indels from the syntenic human and chimpanzee chromosome  <dig> sequences were located around known repetitive dna, and initially filtered out . the remaining  <dig>  were distributed unevenly across the genome features . indels were found under-represented within functional elements , probably due to some selective constraints. this situation is not unique to indels as a subtype among other genomic variants. previously, studies have shown that indel events and single nucleotide substitutions correlate, and there may be common underlying properties for both processes, since indels accumulate in the same parts of the genome that exhibit higher substitution rates  <cit>  with hotspots often coinciding  <cit> . as is the case in single substitutions, indels occur with different frequencies across the genome. specifically, indels are scarcer and shorter in coding sequences  <cit>  where selective constraints are the most intensive, and  <dig> bp indels in the coding regions, which maintain the coding sequence without frameshifts, are by far the most common class  <cit> . in the current study, the approximate class of indels is on average larger and located the furthest from the coding sequences ). approximate indels were only half as numerous as expected within genes , and within the functional elements, they were both shorter than, and not as numerous as the unique and exact ones ). in addition, approximate indels were furthest away from the nearest exons ).

only  <dig> % of all indels characterized in our study were parts of gene elements , nearly a half as many as expected in comparison to the baseline represented by the resampled data . only in the 3' gene flanking regions did indels occur at frequencies similar to the expectation in the resampled dataset. the presence of selective constraints acting on functional elements of the genome probably explains why the intergenic regions contain many more indels than genes  <cit> . however, somewhet unexpectedly, indels in the introns were more frequent than in the intergenic regions . the paucity of intergenic indels is consistent with the presence of unknown regulatory elements or genes  <cit> . other studies point out to a twofold larger number of intronic over the intergenic indels  <cit> , but the filtering of repetitive dnas and the 10-bp cutoff applied in this study likely accounts for the reduced number of intergenic indels observed. our estimate of the number of indels within five gene elements  and introns , if combined, is higher than previously reported . this may reflect our choice to focus on indels longer than  <dig> bp.

structural characteristics and origins of indels
together with identification of the sequence context around indels, the structural characteristics of local repeats proved to be useful for systematic understanding of their nature and origin. more recently, non-homologous end joining mechanism, one of the consequences of double-strand breakage  <cit> , and non-allelic homologous recombination have been proposed as main indel-generating mechanisms  <cit> . still, the role of repeats as the underlying mechanism that gives rise to insertions and deletions should not be overlooked, especially given the indel proximity to known repetitive dna  <cit> , and their frequent association with short duplications  <cit> . other work suggested that indels have been generated mainly by unequal crossing over and replication slippage  <cit> .

all of these molecular mechanisms generate copies of indels, making the presence of identical sequences locally, on the chromosome, and genome-wide a point of interest ). we followed this scheme and found that most of the observed indels in this study  did not have any exact or approximate copies anywhere else in the genome ), but  <dig> of them had copies present on the same chromosome , and seven were found on other chromosomes ).

current analysis focused on delimiting three core indel classes , based on exact or approximate copies of the indel in the flanking sequence , or its unique presence ). differences in repeat structure among indels suggested that a local mechanism of indel formation may be the result of two main duplication processes, where new local duplications, resulting in the exact indel core class, and the subsequent nucleotide substitution generate indels in the approximate class. the origins of the unique core class are not clear, but could be partially explained by a smaller-than-10-bp local repeat structure . approximate and exact copy indels were over-represented, while unique indels were under-represented in the observed dataset . while numerous elsewhere, approximate indels were scarce within genes, and especially within coding sequences, possibly a consequence either of negative selection, and/or their older evolutionary age, compared to the members of other core classes . age of indels may also account for other observations in this study: while exact indels are longer than expected, approximate indels are both shorter and located further away from genes than expected ). unfortunately, the exact core class of indels was not well represented in our survey ), and making inferences about this important class was more tentative.

since distances between conserved duplications are highly preserved between humans and chimpanzees  <cit> , we were able to search for numbers of repeats of each indel sequence among the indel classes. most of the approximate and unique indels were found in clusters represented by four or more copies. these included more than half of exact indels  and more than 2/ <dig> of the approximate ones . this suggests that the number of nearby copies in the two respective classes is an important characteristic of indels, and has a potential to serve as a metric of the evolution of duplicates.

the scale and validation of indel impacts
insertions and deletions comprise less than one percent of known disease-causing mutations  <cit> . some indels can have a significant effect on protein product and gene expression, especially when they are located within functional gene elements  <cit> . according to some estimates, at least 13% of the genes harbour at least one indel  <cit> . insertions in coding sequences often result in translational frameshifts, with the consequence of premature protein termination or nonsense-mediated rna decay  <cit> . it is highly likely that some of them are actually disease-causing, and several indels have already been included in a list of candidate genes for cancer and other disorders  <cit> . our approach identified  <dig> indels in coding exons or in splice site regions of human refseq genes . among these,  <dig> indels were found to alter the sequence of a corresponding protein, and our experimental validation confirmed five: flj <dig>  flj <dig>  nefh, smc1l <dig>  and unc84b .

a parallel study of genetic variation on human chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  suggested that humans harbour similar levels of indel variation: indels represented 22% of the total polymorphic events, which is somewhat more than the 18% reported earlier, but within the predicted range estimate of 16% to 25% of all sequence polymorphisms in humans  <cit> . our findings support the conclusion that a large fraction of the differences between human and chimpanzee genomes is comprised of indels  <cit> . however, not all indels have been validated, or even sequenced; therefore, those estimates should be cautiously evaluated. only three of the  <dig> indels in the coding sequence that had a potential impact on gene function revealed the same indel after sequence analysis .

one of the limitations of the present work was that it utilized the low coverage draft sequence of the chimpanzee genome and relatively early version of the human genomic sequence. however, even an unfinished chimpanzee genomic sequence could be useful for detection of the gene-modifying indels, as demonstrated by previous work  <cit> . our computational and experimental data partially support this notion. unfortunately, incomplete data that consists of misassembled or poor-quality sequences, and unsequenced genomic fragments can also contribute to the high volume of false-positive indels. we addressed this problem in the follow-up validation by pcr and sequencing. not surprisingly, we encountered primate sequences different from anything currently listed in public databases . in the future, higher coverage genomic sequences of the different primate species should allow a more accurate identification of the loci that differentiate primates closely related to humans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the current report, we investigated and discussed several aspects of the indels phenomenon:  indels represent the abundant group of the genomic sequence variations;  the mechanism of their formation is potentially reflected by the local structure of the indel containing region;  indels represent a source of the potential mutations in primate genes and genomes;  indels can play an important role in the understanding of genome evolution and genome plasticity; and  indels are an important of source polymorphisms that directly influence human phenotypes and diseases.
