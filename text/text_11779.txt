BACKGROUND
the past decades have witnessed a dramatic upsurge or emergence of arboviral diseases  <cit> , including dengue  <cit> , chikungunya  <cit> , and zika . since transmission of these viruses occurs through aedes aegypti - one of the most widespread mosquito species globally - the potential for major and possibly concurrent epidemics of these viruses and other as yet unknown mosquito-borne viruses that might emerge, is overwhelming, and emphasizes the pressing need to develop vaccines and antiviral therapeutics  <cit> . moreover, diagnostic tools to reliably distinguish between the various viral infections that often lead to similar clinical symptoms  <cit> , but necessitate distinct management, are urgently required. dengue is considered the currently most important arboviral disease  <cit> , with an estimated  <dig> million cases annually  <cit> . infections are caused by one of at least four antigenically distinct serotypes  that vary by ~ <dig> to 40 % at the amino acid level  <cit> . it has been reported that secondary infection with a heterologous serotype is associated with an increased relative risk of severe disease  <cit> . adequate management of severe dengue cases can greatly reduce the death rate. to date, diagnosis of the infecting serotype is of epidemiological interest, and in the future could potentially be relevant for prognosis in individual patients. moreover, the canonical denv serotypes appear to be antigenically more diverse than previously assumed, requiring more detailed studies of the relevance of individual antigenic determinants for clinical severity, epidemic magnitude, and denv evolution  <cit> .

ever since the development of the b cell hybridoma technology in  <dig>  <cit> , the application of monoclonal antibodies  as tools in the development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, and as general research tools has augmented . mabs provide a number of unique properties including the ability to bind specifically and with high affinity to almost any molecular structure as well as their availability in unlimited quantities as homogeneous reagents. prerequisite for the generation of mabs by the b cell hybridoma technology is the immunization of animals - most commonly mice - with the specific target antigen. in the case of proteins as target structures, immunization of mice has traditionally been accomplished by using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins, an often time-consuming and tedious endeavor. due to their clear advantage in terms of yield and cost, simple prokaryotic expression systems, particularly escherichia coli, or lower eukaryotic hosts, such as yeast, have long dominated the field of recombinant protein expression  <cit> . however, mammalian expression systems that are capable of providing native protein folding, and natural posttranslational modifications, have been increasingly used in the past years to reliably express proteins in their native conformation  <cit> .

in order to meet the requirements for mabs against viral proteins for various public health and research applications, we evaluated here a fast and highly efficient strategy of mouse immunization with native viral antigens using mammalian cells that express the recombinant proteins on their surface. this system is based on the transfection of the human embryonic kidney  suspension cell line 293f with a plasmid vector encoding the protein of interest as fusion protein containing a transmembrane domain, and thereby enabling the presentation of large amounts of the chimeric membrane-bound target antigen on the hek cell surface in a native conformation to the immune system of animals immunized with the transfected cells. the denv genome encodes for three structural  and seven nonstructural  proteins  <cit> . we have chosen the denv ns <dig> protein as recombinant target antigen in this study, since ns <dig> is an important biomarker for early diagnosis of dengue infections and has also been intensively investigated as a potential target for vaccines and antibody-based antiviral therapeutics. depending on its glycosylation status, ns <dig> has a molecular weight of 46–55 kda. the protein exists in multiple oligomeric forms and occurs as intracellular membrane-associated form, on the cell surface, or as a soluble, secreted lipoparticle  <cit>  that can be detected in the serum of dengue patients during the acute phase of the disease  <cit> .

the specific objectives of the present study were i) to prove the suitability of the applied immunization strategy for viral proteins, ii) to generate mabs specifically recognizing the d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig> proteins in their native conformation, and iii) to show that these mabs can be used to detect the endogenous protein in denv-containing biological samples.

RESULTS
expression of d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig> on the surface of transfected hek 293f cells
after transfection of hek cells with the ns <dig> fusion protein-encoding plasmids pcdna <dig> _bvm_d1ns1_flag_tm_his or pcdna <dig> _bvm_d4ns1_flag_tm_his, the expression of d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig> by the transfectants was analyzed. no elevated expression levels of a protein corresponding in size to the ns <dig> protein was visible upon aqua-staining of the sds-page separated total proteins of d1ns1-hek and d4ns1-hek cell lysates when compared to a lysate of untransfected hek cells . however, western blot analysis with anti-hexa-his tag antibodies  confirmed the specific expression of the ns <dig> fusion proteins  by the transfectants. in combination with western blot analysis with anti-tubulin antibodies serving as a loading control , these analyses revealed no significant difference between expression levels of d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig>  ifa of d1ns1-hek, d4ns1-hek and untransfected hek cells with anti-hexa-his tag antibodies demonstrated the cell surface localization of the expressed ns <dig> fusion proteins with similar staining intensities for d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig> .fig.  <dig> expression of d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig> by transfected hek cells. hek cell lysates were analyzed by aqua-staining and western blot analysis after separation on nupage novex 4–12 % bis-tris gels under reducing conditions . while aqua-staining of lysates prepared from hek-derived cell lines expressing d1ns <dig>  and d4ns <dig>  showed no additional band of the predicted size of the ns <dig> proteins, as compared to the lysates of untransfected hek cells  , western blot analysis using anti-hexa-his tag antibodies confirmed the expression of d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig> by the hek cells . western blotting using anti-tubulin antibodies was performed as a control for the amount of cellular proteins of the untransfected and transfected hek cell lysates loaded on the gels . m = molecular weight marker in kda

development of denv ns1-specific antibody responses in mice by immunization with transfected hek cells
immunization of mice with either d1ns1-hek or d4ns1-hek cells resulted in the development of humoral immune responses specific for the ns <dig> proteins . sera of mice immunized with d1ns1-hek contained higher titers of antibodies against recd1ns <dig>  than against recd4ns <dig> . in contrast, similar antibody titers to both recd1ns <dig> and recd4ns <dig> were detected in mice that were immunized with d4ns1-hek cells . individual mouse antisera of the d1ns1-hek and d4ns1-hek mouse groups contained similar levels of antibodies to the ns <dig> target protein. all mouse antisera showed only very low anti-hexa-his tag antibody levels, as determined by elisa of the sera on an unrelated hexa-his tagged protein  .fig.  <dig> elisas showing humoral immune responses of mice immunized with d1ns1-hek and d4ns1-hek cells. a and b: mouse antisera of d1ns1-hek  and d4ns1-hek  immunized mouse groups  were analyzed on recombinant d1ns <dig> and recombinant d4ns <dig>  respectively. c and d: serotype cross-reactive humoral immune responses of d1ns1-hek  and d4ns1-hek  mouse groups were analyzed on recombinant d4ns <dig> and recombinant d1ns <dig>  respectively. blue line  and red line  = pool of d4ns1-hek and d1ns1-hek mouse antisera, respectively, to enable direct comparison with the level of serotype-specific immune responses. e and f: analysis of pooled mouse sera , blue = d4ns1-hek ) on an unrelated hexa-his tagged protein  as a control for humoral responses against the hexa-his tag. black line in all panels = pool of mouse sera before immunization 




generation and characterization of anti-denv ns <dig> mabs
fusion of spleen cells obtained from mice immunized with d1ns1-hek or d4ns1-hek cells with pai myeloma cells enabled the generation of anti-ns <dig> antibody-producing hybridoma cell lines. in order to identify cell lines that produce igg specific for ns <dig>  hybridoma supernatants were screened by elisa on recd1ns <dig> or recd4ns <dig>  respectively. supernatants from elisa-positive wells were subsequently tested by ifa on d1ns1-hek and d4ns1-hek cells. ifa on hek cells transfected with an unrelated hexa-his tagged protein served as control to identify those hybridoma cell lines that generated ns1-specific antibodies. screening of d1ns1-hek and d4ns1-hek mouse spleen cell fusions yielded eight and four anti-denv ns <dig> igg-producing hybridoma cell lines, respectively. these cell lines were cloned by limiting dilution to obtain hybridoma clones producing the mabs nr <dig>  - nr <dig>  and nr <dig>  - nr <dig> , respectively. five mabs were of the igg <dig>  six of the igg2a and one of the igg2b igg subclass . ifa with these mabs on the d1ns <dig> and d4ns <dig> transfectants revealed that five specifically recognized d1ns1-hek but not d4ns1-hek cells, three only reacted with d4ns1-hek cells and the remaining four were cross-reactive with both transfectants .table  <dig> characteristics and reactivities of the generated anti-ns <dig> mabs

in order to test serotype-specificity of the generated mabs on all four denv serotypes, analyses were extended to hek cells expressing d2ns <dig> and d3ns <dig> . when serotype specificity was tested by elisa using anti-hexa-his tag antibodies as common capturing reagent for all four hexa-his tagged ns <dig> fusion proteins from hek cell lysates, different recognition patterns were observed for the  <dig> anti-ns <dig> mabs used as biotinylated detecting reagents in elisa. while five of the eight mabs raised against d1ns <dig>  specifically recognized only d1ns <dig>  three  also cross-reacted with the ns <dig> protein of at least one other serotype. in contrast, all four mabs raised against d4ns <dig>  reacted only with d4ns <dig> in elisa .fig.  <dig> elisas of d1ns1-hek - d4ns1-hek cell whole protein lysates with the generated mabs. denv ns <dig> serotype-specificity of the  <dig> generated mabs was assessed by capturing the ns <dig> protein in d1ns <dig> - d4ns <dig> hek cell lysates using anti-hexa-his tag mabs and detecting the protein with the anti-ns <dig> mabs nr <dig>  - nr <dig>  and nr <dig>  - nr <dig> . a: while analyses with mabs nr <dig>  - nr <dig> , nr <dig>  and nr <dig>  exhibited a high degree of d1ns1-specificity in the elisa, mabs nr <dig> , nr <dig>  and nr <dig>  showed a certain degree of ns <dig> cross-reactivity among different denv serotypes. b: mabs nr <dig>  - nr <dig>  were highly specific for d4ns <dig>  since they did not recognize d1ns <dig> - d3ns <dig> in the hek cell lysates. m = molecular weight marker in kda




detection of virus material derived from denv-infected veroe <dig> cells by the generated mabs
cross-reactivity of the generated mabs with virus-infected cells was analyzed by western blot analysis with lysates of veroe <dig> cells infected with the four different denv serotypes . results were nearly identical to the elisa analysis of all four hexa-his tagged ns <dig> fusion proteins from hek cell lysates with three exceptions: i) the western blot cross-reactive mab nr <dig>  did not react with the d2ns <dig> protein in the elisa, ii) mab nr <dig>  did recognize d3ns <dig> in virus material, but not the ns <dig> protein present in d3ns1-hek cell lysates and iii) mab nr <dig>  recognized ns <dig> in d4ns1-hek cell lysates, but not the one present in the virus-infected cell lysates. analysis with lysates of the virus-infected cells showed that mab nr <dig>  is cross-reactive with all four denv serotypes. five of the mabs specifically reacted with d1ns <dig> and four recognized d4ns <dig> only. one of the mabs cross-reacted with d1ns <dig> - d3ns <dig>  but did not recognize d4ns <dig> and one reacted with d1ns <dig> and d3ns <dig> .fig.  <dig> elisa and western blot analysis of lysates derived from denv-infected veroe <dig> cell lines. a: ns <dig> relative units were determined in lysates of veroe <dig> cells infected with denv serotypes 1– <dig> by ns <dig> capture elisa . ns <dig> relative units were calculated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and approximate values are shown. gels for western blot analysis were loaded with denv serotype 1– <dig> infected veroe <dig> cell lysates containing  <dig>  relative units of ns <dig>  each under non-reducing conditions. the  <dig> generated mabs were tested on serotype  <dig> , serotype  <dig> , serotype  <dig>  and serotype  <dig>  virus-infected cell lysates




discussion
in the present study, we describe an efficient and cost-effective strategy to rapidly generate mouse mabs against native viral proteins. the methodology used is based on the immunization of mice with hek cells presenting the native target proteins on their surface. expression of the proteins on the hek cell surface is achieved by hijacking the hek cell’s synthetic protein machinery upon transfection of the cells with a plasmid encoding the target antigen as fusion protein connected to a transmembrane domain  <cit> . the use of hek cells as a tool for the expression of native proteins has several advantages. for one, hek cells are easy to grow in culture, can efficiently be transfected with commercially available transfection reagents, and are also capable of expressing large amounts of recombinant proteins  <cit> . moreover, mammalian cell cultures - as opposed to prokaryotic or yeast expression systems – represent an optimal tool for the production of viral proteins , since protein folding and post-translational modifications closely approximate those occurring in the infected mammalian hosts  <cit> . the immunization of mice with antigens hooked to the surface of hek cells has the further advantages that neither elaborate production/processing of recombinant antigen nor addition of adjuvant - that both may negatively affect protein folding - are required.

here we used this novel approach to rapidly generate panels of mabs against the denv ns <dig> protein. immunization of mice with d1ns1-hek and d4ns1-hek cells, whose viability was preserved by storage at −80 °c in freezing medium, and subsequent production of hybridoma clones yielded d1ns1- and d4ns <dig> serotype-specific as well as denv ns <dig> serotype cross-reactive mabs. in view of the 30 % variability present among sequences of the four denv serotypes at the amino acid level , it was expected that mice immunized with one serotype will develop both serotype-specific and serotype cross-reactive humoral immune responses. in this study a first selection of the desired mabs was achieved by high-throughput elisa screening of the hybridoma cell supernatants on small amounts of commercially available denv d1ns <dig> - d4ns <dig> recombinant proteins. however, in order to completely circumvent the use of recombinant proteins, lower throughput screening can also be performed by ifa on hek cells transfected with the target protein or by western blot analysis on lysates of transfected hek cells. these assays should be performed in parallel with tests using material from hek cells transfected with an unrelated hexa-his tagged fusion protein to exclude hybridomas producing hek cell and hexa-his tag –specific antibodies from further analysis. seven of the identified mabs  were serotype-specific in all applied assay formats, while one mab  reacted with the ns <dig> protein of each of the four serotypes in all but one  of the assays. the other four mabs  reacted with the ns <dig> protein of at least two, but not all of the four denv serotypes . discrepancies in recognition patterns might be explained by steric differences  in binding of the mabs in different assay formats. western blot analysis of denv-infected cell lysates confirmed that the generated mabs can be used to detect the endogenous ns <dig> protein in denv-infected biological samples. differences in recognition patterns might also be explained by sub-serotype specificity of the generated mabs.

the progressive and ubiquitous threat of newly emerging and re-emerging viral diseases necessitates the development of tools for their prevention, detection and control. in the past decades mabs have been increasingly used for the development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics as well as for research on the epidemiology of pathogens. in this study we were able to prove our approach of rapidly generating panels of mabs against native viral proteins. the envisaged production of serotype and sub-serotype variant specific anti-ns <dig> mabs against all denv serotypes will provide various prospects for their application. antigen capture assays for diagnostic purposes may be developed by using a broadly cross-reactive capturing mab in combination with different serotype-specific detection mabs. variant specific mabs may be used as tools to study the epidemiology of denv isolates based on their antigenic diversity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our cell-based system of immunizing mice with hek cells presenting native viral proteins followed by hybridoma selection provides a highly efficient tool to rapidly obtain mabs against native viral proteins that can be used for various downstream applications. the strategy can easily be extended to a broad range of viral proteins.
