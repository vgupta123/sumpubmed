BACKGROUND
marine fungi are a diverse group of opportunistic and obligate organisms isolated from marine environments  <cit> . in recent years interest in the secondary metabolites and bio-active compounds produced by some of these fungi has grown  <cit>  and they are increasingly included in ecological studies of marine environments  <cit> . recent initiatives to develop and exploit marine resources have led to an increase in the isolation of these fungi and screening for novel compounds.

the marine environment provides microorganisms with substrates which may differ considerably from soil, freshwater and plant environments. for example, macroalgae  contain not only compounds like cellulose and xylan, but also a range of polysaccharides not generally observed in land organisms, such as alginate, agar, carrageenan, ulvan, and fucoidan, many of which are sulphated. the polymers may contain monomers of fucose and uronic acids. although there are accounts of fungi able to degrade these polymers , most of the research has focused on bacterial enzymes  <cit> . since fungi are well known for their ability to produce and secrete proteins, including industrially relevant enzymes, this may reflect a lack of access to marine fungal strains by those carrying out the majority of studies. marine fungi which have been screened for enzymatic activies have generally been found to produce diverse activities  <cit> .

of the enzymes from marine fungi which have been studied, cellulases, xylanases and peroxidases have received the most interest  <cit> . some of the enzymes identified have unique properties of cold  <cit> , salt  <cit> , alkali  <cit>  or acid  <cit>  tolerance, which may also be of commercial interest.

in this paper we consider the capacity of six diverse marine fungi  to utilise a range of polymeric substrates derived primarily from plants or macroalgae for growth . growth on these substrates indicated that they produce a wide range of polymer degrading enzymes, including low levels of enzymes which degrade or modify sulphated polymers. the results confirm that marine fungi could be a good source of enzymes, including enzymes for degradation of macroalgal polymers, which may become more widely available as these are being considered as a source of biomass for biorefineries.

RESULTS
all strains grew with glucose as sole carbon source and nitrogen provided as ammonium . to avoid the decrease in ph associated with uptake of ammonium from the medium, growth on urea was also assessed, but p. pinophilum lf <dig> was unable to use it as a nitrogen source and b. robillardoides lf <dig> grew poorly, so ammonium was used as the nitrogen source for comparing growth on the various carbon substrates. growth was assessed as colony radial growth rate  on the various substrates  and as dry biomass on polymers derived from macroalgae . it should be noted that colony radial growth rate does not necessarily reflect the amount of biomass produced  <cit> . some strains branch less frequently on poor carbon sources, enabling the hyphae to extend more rapidly in search of better carbon sources. thus growth  on agar-solidified medium was also assessed visually . all strains grew to some extent on media containing only agar as carbon source or lacking nitrogen , which was taken into consideration when assessing growth on other substrates, such as arabinose.table  <dig> growth on agar-solidified medium with various carbon sources, ammonium as n source

all strains grew on both casein and gelatin as nitrogen sources, indicating that all strains produced extracellular proteases . calcarisporium sp. kf <dig>  tritirachium sp. lf <dig>  s. brevicaulis lf <dig>  and pestalotiopsis sp. kf <dig> caused precipitation of para-κ-casein from casein, whereas b. robillardoides lf <dig> and p. pinophilum lf <dig> did not. growth on casein was generally better than growth on gelatin, but lf <dig> and lf <dig> grew equally on both protein sources. good protease production has also been observed from marine derived aspergillus, beauveria and acremonium species  <cit> . all strains except calcarisporium sp. kf <dig> were able to use nitrate as sole nitrogen source .

growth of calcarisporium sp. kf <dig> on polymeric carbon sources
calcarisporium species are commonly isolated as mycoparasites or symbionts of higher fungi  <cit> , and less frequently from marine environments. strain kf <dig> was isolated from the german wadden sea and has been shown to produce macrocyclic and linear polyesters and cyclodepsipeptides  <cit> . parasitic species are also known to produce various bioactive compounds . the variability of intracellular enzymes of some strains of c. arbuscula has been assessed  <cit> . the physiology of strain kf <dig> has not been extensively characterised, but tamminen et al.  <cit>  reported that it grew slowly  and did not grow at temperatures above 24 °c.

calcarisporium sp. kf <dig> grew on agar-solidified medium on all carbon sources provided except perhaps arabinose, carboxymethyl cellulose  and carrageenan, on which growth was similar to that observed on agar . it produced sparser, more rapidly extending hyphae in the absence of easily metabolised carbon source than in its presence . thus low kr values for kf <dig> represent better growth than higher kr values and glucose, laminarin, galactose and fucose represented the most readily utilised carbon sources . cellulose, pectin, oil, starch, and xylan  also supported good biomass production, although the kr values were higher than on glucose. growth on ulvans, fucoidan and alginate was more dense than that observed when agar was the only c-source or with agar and arabinose or carrageenan, although the kr on ulvans was high .

kf <dig> produced high background growth on medium containing only agar, suggesting that it was able to partially utilise agar as a carbon source. this was confirmed by growing kf <dig> in flasks in medium containing 2 g l− <dig> agar as the sole carbon source. growth was observed within 7 days , whereas essentially no growth  had occurred in medium lacking a carbon source . similarly, kf <dig> grew on carrageenan , but did not completely metabolise it. growth on ulvan , arabinogalactan , and alginate  in the absence of agar was also confirmed in liquid cultures. kf <dig> produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l− <dig> biomass from glucose and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l− <dig> from laminarin during the same time interval.

kf <dig> showed the most extensive growth on substrates such as agar, carrageenan and alginates, of the fungi considered here. it also grew on sulphated ulvans and arabinogalactans, although it did not appear to utilise arabinose. the slow growth of kf <dig> would be undesirable in a production organism, but it may be a source of novel fungal enzymes which could be expressed in alternative hosts.

growth of tritirachium sp. lf <dig> on polymeric carbon sources
tritirachium sp. lf <dig> was isolated from a sponge growing in the adriatic sea  <cit> . tritirachium species have been described as airborne contaminants and have been isolated from plant and packing material  <cit>  and from soil  <cit> . t. album limber is a producer of serine protease  <cit> . although not common in the marine environment, t. candoliense has also been isolated from the anoxic zone in the arabian sea  <cit>  and others have been isolated from australian coastal waters  <cit> . apart from the proteinases, hydrolytic enzymes have not been studied.

lf <dig> had a low kr , changes in which did not reflect either good or poor growth . better growth was observed on galactose, fucose, arabinose, starch, laminarin, xylan , pectin and oil . lf <dig> was the only strain included in this study which utilised arabinose as a carbon source. lf <dig> also grew on cellulose, and to some extent on cmc, ulvans, arabinogalactan, fucoidan, and alginate.

lf <dig> grew as well on laminarin as on glucose in liquid culture , with a yield of  <dig>  g biomass per g substrate consumed. biomass production on arabinogalactan  and alginate  was also confirmed in liquid cultures. biomass production from ulvans  was comparable to that of kf <dig> or lf <dig>  but was not significantly greater  than that of the no carbon control because of variability between the cultures.

growth of bartalinia robillardoides lf <dig> on polymeric carbon sources
bartalinia robillardoides lf <dig> was isolated from a marine sponge  obtained from the adriatic sea near rovinj, croatia  <cit> . a bartalinia specie has also been isolated from the sponge gelliode fibrosa in the pacific  <cit> , but b. robillardoides strains are more typically isolated from plants  <cit> , leaf litter  <cit>  or insect  <cit> . apart from taxonomic studies, the main interest in b. robillardoides has been in its secondary metabolites, which include taxol  <cit>  and various azophilones  <cit> . enzyme activities from b. robillardoides have not been reported.

lf <dig> grew well on glucose, laminarin, starch, xylan , pectin, oil, cellulose, cmc, galactose, and fucose . weak growth was observed on ulvans, arabinogalactan and fucoidan . there was no clear correlation between kr and good growth. low krs on fucoidan and fucose indicated that these substrates were perceived by the fungus. lf <dig> did not grow on arabinose and background growth on agar was very low. growth on ulvans  and arabinogalactan  was confirmed in liquid cultures, as was the inability to grow on agar .

growth of penicillium pinophilum lf <dig> on polymeric carbon sources
penicillium species, including p. pinophilum, are frequently isolated from marine environments  <cit> , as well as being common in soil and other land environments. p. pinophilum, like other penicillia, is known for producing bioactive metabolites  <cit> . enzymes involved in the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass have been identified from various isolates , and a gene encoding a dextranase was recently cloned from a marine isolate  <cit> .

like kf <dig>  lf <dig> generally showed reduced rates of expansion on poor carbon sources, although kr was not strongly affected by the carbon source . dense growth was observed on galactose, starch, laminarin, xylan , and pectin . weak growth was observed on cellulose, cmc, oil, ulvans, arabinogalactan, fucose, fucoidan, alginate and carrageenan. background growth on agar was very low, as was growth on arabinose. utilisation of ulvans, fucoidan, alginate, agar or carrageenan was not observed in liquid culture, in which lf <dig> grew poorly as pellets, with high variation between cultures . even in glucose  and laminarin  containing medium, biomass production was low even though all glucose had been consumed.

growth of scopulariopsis brevicaulis lf <dig> on polymeric carbon sources
scopulariopsis brevicaulis is the anamorph of microascus brevicaulis and is commonly found in soil environments. some strains have been isolated from skin or nails, where it appears to be an opportunistic pathogen. it has only occasionally been isolated from marine environments , but has also been found in other high salt environments  <cit> . production of keratinase  <cit>  and l-methioninase  <cit>  has been reported.

like kf <dig>  lf <dig> produced sparser, more rapidly extending hyphae in the absence of easily metabolised carbon source than on glucose . however, colonies produced on glucose were much more compact  than those growing on fucose, galactose, pectin, laminarin, starch or xylan , although these substrates also supported good biomass production . thus high kr values for lf <dig> do not necessarily represent poor growth. colony expansion on glucose may have been affected by reduction in the local ph , caused by ammonium uptake in the poorly buffered medium. this hypothesis was supported by the much higher colony expansion rates observed on medium containing either urea  or nitrate  . however, this reduction in ph did not appear to affect growth in liquid medium, in which glucose was completely metabolised . lf <dig> also grew on oil, cellulose, cmc and arabinogalactan, whereas growth on carrageenan, alginate or fucose was poor, with even less growth on arabinose, ulvans, fucoidan or agar . lf <dig> colonies expanded much more rapidly on these carbon sources than on agar, indicating that they were sensed by the fungus.

the genome of s. brevicaulis lf <dig> was recently published and the profile of putative carbohydrate-active enzymes identified in the genome analysis  <cit> . kumar et al.  <cit>  concluded that lf <dig> should be well adapted for the breakdown of terrestrial plant materials, having numerous putative glycoside hydrolases with homology to xylanases, pectinases, cellulases and lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases. the good growth on xylan and pectin supported their conclusions, although growth on cellulose was weaker than might have been expected.

lf <dig> produced less background growth on agar-solidified medium lacking other carbon source than kf <dig> or lf <dig>  growth in flasks containing 2 g l− <dig> agar as the sole carbon source was not significantly greater  than in flasks without carbon source . however, measureable growth  was observed on alginate  and arabinogalactan . more biomass was produced from ulvans  than was expected based on the growth on agar-solidified medium. biomass production from laminarin  was similar to that from glucose , with a yield of  <dig>  g biomass per g substrate indicating complete metabolism . however, as predicted  <cit> , lf <dig> appears better adapted for hydrolysis of plant than of macroalgal biomass.

growth of pestalotiopsis sp. kf <dig> on polymeric carbon sources
pestalotiopsis species are predominantly anamorphic, commonly found as endophytes or plant pathogens, but also able to live saprophytically, and are isolated from very diverse environments, including marine environments  <cit> . they have recently gained considerable interest because of the diversity of secondary metabolites of potential commercial interest which they produce  <cit> . the cellulases, hemicellulases and laccases of some strains isolated from mangrove swamps have also been investigated  <cit> .

kf <dig> had a high kr on glucose  and generally showed reduced rates of expansion on poor carbon sources . dense growth at high kr values was observed on starch, laminarin, pectin and oil, while dense growth with lower colony expansion rates was observed on xylan , cellulose, cmc and galactose . weak growth was observed on ulvans, arabinogalactan, fucoidan, fucose, arabinose, alginate and carrageenan . background growth on agar was relatively high, but measurable biomass production was not observed within 7 days in shaken flasks containing 2 g l− <dig> agar . no biomass was produced from alginate or carrageenan in liquid culture, but growth of kf <dig> on ulvans , fucoidan  and arabinogalactan  was observed. laminarin  was used as the control. kf <dig> thus appeared more likely to be a source of enzymes for hydrolysing plant biomass than for seaweed-derived biomass, although its ability to utilise ulvans may be of interest.

CONCLUSIONS
growth of calcarisporium sp. kf <dig>  tritirachium sp. lf <dig>  bartalinia robillardoides lf <dig>  penicillium pinophilum lf <dig>  scopulariopsis brevicaulis lf <dig> and pestalotiopsis sp. kf <dig> on polymeric substrates demonstrated that each was able to produce protease, amylase, glucanase, xylanase, pectinases and lipase. growth on laminarin and starch was generally comparable to that on glucose, demonstrating the efficiency with which amylases and glucanases were produced. although they grew well on xylan, none of these cells grew well on cellulose or cmc, indicating only weak production of cellulase or endoglucanase.

all strains except p. pinophilum lf <dig> were also able to grow on sulphated arabinogalactan, even though only tritirachium sp. lf <dig> could metabolise arabinose. all strains utilised galactose. only calcarisporium sp. kf <dig> produced biomass from the sulphated galactans, agar and carrageenan. agarases and carageenases from bacteria have received considerable attention  <cit> , but there are few reports of these activities from filamentous fungi  <cit> .

the sulphated fucoidan was not clearly metabolised by any strain, although they appeared able to use fucose as a carbon source and all responded to the presence of fucoidan in the medium.

several strains grew on both sources of ulvan, indicating that they may be a source for novel ulvan and glucuronan lyases or hydrolases, few of which have been characterised . however, the limited growth observed on ulvan suggests that the enzyme levels are low, or that these strains do not have complete pathways for its degradation.

calcarisporium sp. kf <dig>  s. brevicaulis lf <dig> and tritirachium sp. lf <dig> produced biomass from alginate. although most studies of alginate lyases have focused on those obtained from marine bacteria  <cit> , alginate lyase activity has also been observed in marine isolates of a. oryzae  <cit>  and dendryphiella salina  <cit> .

marine fungi clearly produce a wide range of hydrolytic activities and should be considered as more than just providers of novel lignocellulolytic enzymes. more in depth study of the enzymes from marine fungi, as well as from bacteria, is needed to identify novel activities and enzymes with novel properties to enhance our understanding of polymer metabolism and to provide catalysts for future biorefineries. although the native hosts may secrete only small amounts of these enzymes, their genes may provide a rich new source of novel enzymes.
