BACKGROUND
bacterial dna is a potent immunostimulant
 <cit>  and research has found that the abundance of cpg dinucleotides  in genomes of prokaryotes is a major factor contributing to its immunostimulatory properties
 <cit> . toll-like receptor  <dig>  has been identified as a major player in the innate immune response to bacterial dna and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides  that contain unmethylated cpg motifs
 <cit> .

the members of the tlr family are well-conserved type i transmembrane proteins characterized by a leucine-rich domain involved in ligand recognition and a toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  intracellular signalling domain
 <cit> . acting as innate immune receptors, members of this family have been found to mediate the response to different bacteria- and virus-derived molecules, including lipopolysaccharide, bacterial lipopeptides
 <cit> , double-stranded rna
 <cit>  and cpgs
 <cit> .

due to the importance of foreign- and host-derived dna for induction of protective reactions against pathogens and autoimmune disorders, respectively, a great deal of research has been devoted to studying the immunostimulatory properties of cpgs and the function of tlr <dig> . in mammals, the receptor is found in the endoplasmic reticulum in resting immune cells. upon exposure of the cells to cpg dna, tlr <dig> translocates to the endosomal compartments
 <cit> , where it may interact with its ligand. the binding of the receptor to dna seems to be sequence independent but it requires low ph conditions and proteolytical activation
 <cit> . once activated, the receptor signals through myeloid differentiation primary response gene  <dig>  to activate transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa-b  and interferon-regulatory factor  <dig>  involved in the upregulation of proinflammatory genes and type i interferon , respectively
 <cit> .

the function of tlr <dig> is relatively well-characterized in mammals; however, its function in lower vertebrates remains obscure. tlr <dig> has been identified in teleosts
 <cit> , and the expression of the protein in atlantic salmon  leukocytes is inducible by ifn-γ
 <cit> . it has been shown that the bacterial dna and cpg odns are able to activate immune cells in fish
 <cit> . in particular, research has found that the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine in cpg-stimulated trout macrophages relies on efficient endosomal acidification
 <cit> . like in mammals, salmon leukocytes are able to distinguish between different classes of cpg odns by upregulating type i ifn and stimulating lymphocyte proliferation
 <cit>  and data suggests that in japanese flounder  tlr <dig> is involved in the up-regulation of a tumor necrosis factor-alpha  promoter by cpgs
 <cit> . these data indicate that the tlr <dig> function is conserved throughout the vertebrate classes; however, direct interaction between stimulatory cpg odn and tlr <dig> has not been demonstrated in non-mammalian vertebrates, so far.

the major goal of the current study has been to characterize the ability of a salmon tlr <dig> homolog  to interact and mediate the response to immunostimulatory, phosphorothioate -modified cpg odns. the results demonstrate that the binding of sstlr <dig> to ps-modified odns is not dependent on the presence of cpgs; however, the affinity of this interaction is ph-dependent. transgenic sstlr <dig> is able to spontaneously activate ifn-stimulated response element -containing promoter constructs. nevertheless, unlike in primary leukocytes, it fails to colocalize with cpg odns when overexpressed in salmonid cell lines. the study further identifies proteins that contain rna recognition motifs , including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a <dig>  and nuclear receptor coactivator  <dig> , as potential mediators of the effects of exogenous dna in salmon immune cells.

RESULTS
sstlr <dig> binds phosphorothioate-modified odns through a cpg-independent but a ph-dependent mechanism
a pull-down approach was used in order to find out whether sstlr <dig> is able to bind cpg odns. adherent mononuclear phagocytes isolated from head kidney were first stimulated for 48 hours with ifn-γ
 <cit>  in order to upregulate the sstlr <dig> protein
 <cit>  and then stimulated for 2 hours with biotinylated cpg-b prior to lysis and coprecipitation with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. the western blot  results shown in figure 
1a demonstrate that sstlr <dig> coprecipitates with the streptavidin beads only when the cells have been treated with biotinylated but not with non-labelled cpg-b odns. furthermore, addition of a 5-fold higher dose of non-labelled cpg-b  to the biotinylated cpgs prior to stimulation significantly reduced the amount of the coprecipitated sstlr <dig>  which further confirmed the specificity of the binding. tlr <dig> is known to interact with dna in acidified organelles including endosomes and lysosomes
 <cit> . to analyse the efficiency of the binding of cpg odns to sstlr <dig> under different ph conditions, the acidity of the lysis buffer was adjusted using hcl. the results presented in figure 
1b show that the efficiency of coprecipitation of both cpg-b and non-stimulatory, inverted cpg-b odns with tlr <dig> increases gradually with the reduction of the ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> . therefore, the binding of sstlr <dig> to odns is independent of their immunostimulatory capacity and is most efficient under low ph.

sstlr <dig> up-regulated by cpg-b and ifn-γ translocates to endosomal compartments where it colocalizes with its ligand
in order to interact with its ligand and to initiate signalling, tlr <dig> needs to be translocated from endoplasmic reticulum to the endosomes
 <cit> . in the current study, immunostaining combined with confocal microscopy analysis confirms that both in cpg and ifn-γ-treated mononuclear phagocytes, sstlr <dig> colocalizes with fluorescent cpg-b in granules and vesicles . while sstlr <dig> staining in resting phagocytes is not clearly distinguishable from the background, stimulation with cpg-b for 24 hours results in detectable signal, most of which is found in cytoplasmic granules and speckles where it colocalizes with the endocytosed cpgs. the results presented in figure 
2b indicate that in primary mononuclear phagocytes, the endocytosed cpgs accumulate in tubular structures and vesicles. most of the vesicles are lysosensor-positive indicating that these are maturing endolysosomes. priming the cells with ifn-γ results in increased accumulation of cpgs in endolysosomes which correlates with the enhanced sstlr <dig> expression and colocalization with cpgs, as compared to non-primed cells . lysosensor staining is not compatible with immunocytochemistry since it is destroyed by membrane permeabilization. however, the fact that most of the cpg positive vesicles in ifn-γ primed cells are lysosensor-positive and that a considerable number of them, are sstlr9-positive indicates that it is very likely that at least some of the sstlr9-cpg interaction occurs in endolysosomes.

sstlr <dig>  overexpressed in chinook salmon embryo  cells, spontaneously upregulates the transcriptional activity of isre-containing promoters but the receptor fails to respond to cpg-stimulation
reporter gene assays  are commonly used to assess the function of genes through a “gain of function” approach. namely, overexpression of immune molecules such as tlr homologs and their downstream signalling mediators in cells lines that don’t express these proteins may result in an enhanced response to the ligands that require their presence. in the current study, chse cells were used for the rgas as these cells are transfectable  with transfection reagents with low toxicity such as fugene . as shown in figure 
3a, after transfection with a plasmid that expresses sstlr <dig> under the control of the cytomegalovirus  promoter, the activity of the salmon ifna <dig> promoter, the trout mx <dig> promoter and a promoter containing tandem isre repeats were significantly upregulated. in all of these promoters isre elements are essential for their activity
 <cit> . in contrast, the activity of the nfkb promoter construct did not seem to be affected under these experimental conditions. when control  cells were stimulated with cpg-a, cpg-b and poly, the isre and the mx promoters were modestly activated. the upregulation was most pronounced with the mx promoter and upon poly stimulation. no synergistic promoter upregulation could be observed when tlr9-transfected cells were incubated with any of the stimulants.

aliquots from the rga samples were analysed by western blotting to check the expression of the transgenic sstlr <dig> and to investigate whether endogenous tlr <dig> is expressed in chse cells. results shown in figure 
 <dig> demonstrate that, while the expression of the transgenic sstlr <dig> is abundant, no sign of endogenous sstlr <dig> can be detected in the stimulated samples, even after the wb membrane has been developed with an ultra-sensitive substrate . the tlr <dig> mrna expression in chse cells was analysed with a taqman assay. the analysis did not detect tlr <dig> mrna in non-treated chse cells while only weak expression was detected after the cells had been stimulated with ifna <dig> for at least 48 h .

chse cells accumulate cpgs in late endosomes and lysosomes but fail to translocate ectopically expressed sstlr <dig> into these compartments. also, in the salmon head kidney-derived cell line to, no colocalization between the cpgs and sstlr <dig> was found
to test whether chse cells can efficiently accumulate cpg odns in endolysosomal compartments, the cells were stimulated for different periods with fluorescent cpgs. the late endosomes and lysosomes  were stained with lysosensor green and the colocalization was analysed with confocal microscopy. within 15 min of stimulation, cpg odns could be detected in small vesicles; however, at this time point, there was no clear colocalization with lysosensor-positive vesicles . after 60 min, some of the endocytosed cpgs entered the acidic vesicles indicating transition from early to late endosomes. at 24 hours post-stimulation, significant amounts of cpg-b odns were accumulated in late endosomes and lysosomes. in addition, the fluorescent cpgs could be observed in tubular structures which most likely represent the tubular lysosomal system. these data indicate that chse cells have the capacity to accumulate large amounts of cpg and to redistribute them from early endosomes to acidified vesicles and tubular compartments of the endo-lysosomal system.

to determine the intracellular distribution of ectopically expressed sstlr <dig>  chse cells were cotransfected with an sstlr9-expressing plasmid and a vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein . the egfp expression was used as a positive control to identify transfected cells. when the transfected chse cells were stained with the sstlr <dig> antibody, specific signal was observed only in cells that express the cotransfected egfp confirming the specificity of the immunostaining . although these cells had accumulated significant levels of cpg odns 24 hours after stimulation, unlike in primary mononuclear phagocytes, no colocalization between transgenic sstlr <dig> and cy5-labelled cpg odns could be observed. similar results were obtained when to cells, a cell line derived from salmon head kidney was used .

isolation of cpg-b odn-binding proteins from primary salmon mononuclear phagocytes. cytoplasmic egfp-hnrnpa <dig> fusion protein colocalizes with cpg-b odns
the pull-down experiments in the current study demonstrate that sstlr <dig> expressed in primary head kidney mononuclear phagocytes specifically coprecipitates with cpg odns. to identify other molecules that might be involved in the cpg recognition and signalling, proteins that coprecipitated with biotinylated cpgs were analysed with page/silver staining and mass spectrometry. initially, the cell isolation, stimulation and isolation was performed as in the experiments used for the characterization of sstlr <dig> binding. as a result, in addition to the many non-specific bands visible on the silver-stained sds-page gels, three distinct bands that appeared to specifically bind and copurify with the cpg-b odns were detected . these bands appeared only in lanes loaded with samples from cells treated with biotinylated odns. the intensity of their staining correlated with the concentration of the odns and most importantly, stimulation of the cells in the presence of an excess of unlabelled cpg-b odns inhibited their purification. these bands were isolated and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight  analysis, however, due to the extremely low protein amount, most of which is destroyed by the silver-staining, no proteins could be identified. therefore, an alternative approach was undertaken in order to circumvent the need to isolate protein bands through sds-page/silver staining. to reduce the background, instead of boiling in the presence of lds sample buffer, the proteins were released from the magnetic beads through incubation with either a combination of unlabelled cpg odns and biotin, or cpg odns only. the silver stained gels shown in figure 
5b demonstrate that, through this approach, the contamination of the samples with proteins that non-specifically attach to the streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads has been significantly reduced. using a combination of unlabelled odns and biotin seemed to be a more efficient recovery method for proteins that bind cpg-odns; however, there were still non-specific bands which most likely include biotin-binding proteins. incubation of the beads with the unlabelled odns resulted in a very low protein recovery; however, due to the superior purity of the sample, an aliquot of it was used directly for tryptic digestion and lc ms-ms analysis as described in “methods”. the proteins identified in this sample are listed in table 
 <dig> 
1a. the samples were further boiled in lds sample buffer and subjected to page and silver staining. addition of an excess of unlabelled cpg-b inhibits the co-precipitation of the bands indicated with “*” suggesting that these represent proteins that specifically bind to the odns. b, in order to identify the cpg-binding proteins through ms, milder elution techniques were used either through a combination of biotin and cpgs  and cpgs only  as described in “methods”.

of these, ncoa <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> contain rrms domains which are known for their binding affinity for rna and dna and may, potentially, be involved in direct binding to the cpg-b odns in the current study. a third identified protein, actin-beta , is a major component in the cell cytoskeleton. it is involved in multiple cellular functions and is known to interact with multiple targets. therefore, its copurification with cpg-b odns may be mediated through other proteins that directly bind to the odns. interestingly, hnrnp a <dig> protein has previously been shown to associate with cpg odns in pull-down experiments using a mammalian microglial cell line
 <cit> . in the current study, using an antibody recognizing hnrnpa <dig> the interaction with the odns was confirmed. as seen in figure 
6a, hnrnpa <dig> specifically coprecipitates with cpg-b-odns.
1a. b, transgenic salmon hnrnpa <dig> is detected both in cell nuclei and cytoplasm and it colocalizes with fluorescent cpg-b. chse cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing an egfp-hnrnpa <dig> fusion protein  and stimulated with cy5-cpg-b as in figure 
 <dig>  the transgenic hnrnpa <dig> was observed mostly in cell nuclei ; however, in cells which appear to be in a process of cytokinesis , hnrnpa <dig> can be observed in cytoplasmic granules where it colocalizes with cy5-cpgb . the cell nuclei were counter-stained with 7-aad . note that the emission, but not the excitation, spectrum of 7-aad overlaps with that of cy- <dig> and therefore, this channel detects both the genomic dna and the endocytosed cpgs.

it is well known that, like other members of its populous family, hnrnpa <dig> is located predominantly in the cell nucleus; however, as rna-binding proteins some hnrnps are shuttled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and in the latter they may associate with rna granules
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
6b, overexpression of salmon hnrnpa <dig> results both in nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the transgenic protein. whereas most of the gfp-labelled fusion protein has nucleic distribution, in doublets, which appear to be in the process of, or have recently finished cytokinesis, hnrnpa <dig> is also seen in the cytoplasm. in some cells, cytoplasmic granules of the fusion protein also colocalize with endocytosed cpg-b odns thus indicating that the specific interaction detected with the pull-down experiments has the potential to occur in live cells and it is, probably, not merely an artefact of the experimental procedures.

discussion
the major goal of the current study has been to investigate the potential of sstlr <dig> to serve as an immune receptor for cpg odns and to identify additional proteins involved in the recognition of these molecules in salmon innate immune cells. the presented results show that sstlr <dig> does have the capacity to participate in the recognition of cpgs in atlantic salmon mononuclear phagocytes as specific binding has been demonstrated. unlike another study in which odns were added to cell lysates prior to coprecipitation
 <cit> , in the current research, the cells were first stimulated with the ligand, washed extensively and then lysed and processed for coprecipitation. this approach results in relatively poor protein recovery. however, it should be considered that, eukaryotic cells express large numbers of proteins with sequence-dependent and independent binding affinity to different types of nucleic acids. therefore, the experimental approach where cell lysates are mixed with labelled nucleic acids could result in isolation of proteins that in live cells may not be able to interact with the immunostimulatory ligands due to spatial sequestration. furthermore, the ligand-binding studies for tlrs can be additionally complicated by the specific conditions needed by some tlrs to assume efficient ligand-binding conformation. this is particularly important for endosomal tlrs, including tlr <dig>  which has been shown to require proteolytic cleavage and low ph in order to be able to bind and activate immune response to foreign nucleic acids
 <cit> . in agreement with this, in the current study adjusting the ph of the lysis buffer resulted in more efficient sstlr <dig> recovery. in this case, the low ph most likely prevented the dissociation of the cpg that had already been associated with the receptor in the endosomes. while it is still possible that some of the coprecipitated sstlr <dig> might have interacted with the odn after the lysis, the immunostaining confirmed that sstlr <dig> colocalizes with cpg-b odns in intracellular vesicles. the fact that most of the cpg-positive vesicles were also lysosensor-positive indicates that these are maturing endolysosomes . these results are in agreement with previous studies with primary trout macrophages that have shown that the immunostimulatory capacity of cpgs depends on processes in which endosomal acidification is required
 <cit> .

studies on mammalian tlr <dig> have indicated that binding to odns is not sequence-dependent, while the activation of the receptor relies on cpg-induced conformational changes
 <cit> . furthermore, it has been demonstrated that in order to assume efficient ligand-binding conformation, tlr <dig> needs to be processed by endosomal proteases
 <cit> . this is considered to be a mechanism through which the cells control the signalling of tlr <dig> and other nucleic acid-binding tlrs and prevent their activation by endogenous ligands. in the current study, no evidence for proteolytic processing of sstlr <dig> could be detected as only the predicted full-length molecule  was specifically detected on the wb. the pull-down study also demonstrated that it is the full-length sstlr <dig>  rather than any proteolytically processed forms, that binds the odns. it light of the studies mentioned above, it might be questioned whether the sstlr <dig> detected in the current study represents the functional receptor. although the processed form of murine tlr <dig> had a higher potential to interact with dna and signal the presence of cpgs, the full-length receptor also had some functional capacity. furthermore, in another study, the authors showed that a chimeric tlr9/tlr <dig> receptor, which translocated to the cell membrane instead to the endolysosomal compartments, was still able to recognize dna although it had not been proteolytically processed
 <cit> . this study highlights the importance of the receptor localization for the control of the immune response to foreign and endogenous dna molecules. interestingly, the place of the proteolytic cleavage which is found between residues  <dig> and  <dig> of mouse tlr9
 <cit>  lies within a phylogenetically poorly-conserved region. sequence alignment of teleost and mammalian tlr <dig> sequences has shown that, in addition to the relatively low amino acid identity, in teleosts this region harbours a large insertion that is absent in the mammalian sequences
 <cit> . therefore it is possible that the proteolytic processing of tlr <dig> might not be present in teleosts. despite these differences, the current study has demonstrated that the odn-binding capacity of sstlr <dig> is ph dependent indicating that the dna-binding properties of sstlr <dig> in salmon leukocytes might still be restricted to the endolysosomes,.

the translocation of tlr <dig> from the endoplasmic reticulum relies on its association with other molecules such as the polytopic membrane protein unc93b1
 <cit> . in the absence of functional unc93b <dig>  tlr <dig> cannot be translocated to the endolysosomal compartments. therefore, the difference between the intracellular distribution of endogenously expressed sstlr <dig> and its overexpression in cell lines may be explained by the absence of the appropriate molecular mechanisms for redistribution of sstlr <dig> in the cell lines. it is possible that chse and to cells lack the machinery required for targeting the receptor to the endosomes. this may also explain why transgenic sstlr <dig> did not augment the response to cpgs in chse cells. nevertheless, the sstlr <dig> overexpression spontaneously activated the activity of promoters that contain isre elements. this indicates that the cloned molecule is functional and highlights the potential of the receptor to mediate ifn upregulation and induction of antiviral genes in response to pathogens.

as revealed by the current study, the chse cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous tlr <dig> protein and they are not able to relocate the transgenic sstlr <dig> to compartments where it may be activated by cpg odns. however, these cells can efficiently endocytose and accumulate odns within late endosomes and they do respond to stimulation with different immunostimulatory nucleotides as demonstrated by the rgas. this suggests that chse cells use alternative receptors that allow them to respond to odns by activating promoters of ifn-responsive genes.

as tlr <dig> is an intracellular receptor that is not involved in dna uptake, it is obvious that the uptake and the distribution of exogenous dna by cells rely on other molecules. the endocytosis of cpg odns by immune cells has been suggested to be dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis, more specifically on the function of scavenger receptors
 <cit> . however, the exact mechanisms that regulate the distribution of different types of cpg odns within specific endosomal compartments are still obscure. studies have also suggested that, in addition to tlr <dig>  there are other molecules that mediate the signalling properties of immunomodulatory dna sequences
 <cit> . the isolation of proteins that specifically bind cpg odns and that could serve as mediators of the biological activity of cpg odns in primary cells, requires development of techniques for both efficient and specific protein purification. the results presented in the current paper suggest that hnrnpa <dig> and ncoa <dig> may, potentially, be involved in the cpg response. unlike actb which probably copurifies with cpg odns through indirect binding, both hnrnpa <dig> and ncoa <dig> possess rrm domains which have binding affinity for both rna and single-stranded dna suggesting direct interaction with the odns. of these molecules, hnrnpa <dig> is particularly interesting since it has been previously identified as a protein which specifically binds to cpg odns in rat gliobastoma cells
 <cit> . in this study the authors also identified a number of other odn binding proteins; however, the experimental approach chosen by these researchers  allows for the isolation of proteins that in viable cells may not have access to the endocytosed cpgs.

the hnrnpa <dig> belongs to a protein family whose members have predominantly nuclear distribution and, therefore, it is questionable whether the observed interaction may be an artefact issuing from the binding of the protein to cpg odns released by endosomes after the cell lysis. however, the experiments with transgenic salmon hnrnpa <dig> presented here demonstrate that in dividing chse cells this molecule is found mostly in the cytoplasm. in the current paper, it is also shown that the hnrnpa0-gfp fusion protein colocalizes with cpg odns in granular structures within the cytoplasm of chse cells indicating that it is likely that the observed interaction has occurred in the live cells prior to, rather than after the cell lysis and that this binding might have biological significance..

the functions of mammalian hnrnpa <dig> are still poorly characterized. since the general functions of the members of the hnrnp family are, posttranscriptional rna processing and transport
 <cit> , it is not very likely that hnrnpa <dig> may be directly involved in the intracellular signalling events triggered by cpgs. interestingly, it has been suggested that, in mouse, this protein might be implicated in the regulation of the immune response to lps stimulation
 <cit> . more specifically, upon lps stimulation of mouse macrophages, this protein binds to au-rich elements  of cyclooxygenase- <dig> , tnf-α and macrophage inflammatory protein- <dig> mrnas suggesting a role in the regulation of their stability and the cytokine production. currently, there is no functional data linking the capacity of hnrnpa <dig> to bind cpg odns with its potential to regulate cytokine stability. in this regard; further studies in this direction would be relevant.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study has indicated that sstlr <dig> has the capacity to bind ps-modified oligonucleotides through a sequence-independent but a ph-dependent mechanism. the potential of this receptor to activate ifn responses is highlighted by the presented functional studies showing its capacity to activate isre-containing promoters. the data further indicate that the redistribution of this receptor and its colocalization with cpg odns within endosomal compartments is cell type-dependent. finally, the study identifies the nucleotide-binding proteins hnrnpa <dig> and ncoa <dig> as cpg odn-binding proteins. further studies are needed to investigate the sequence specificity of these interactions and to investigate whether these proteins might have a role in modulating the cellular response to foreign dna molecules.
