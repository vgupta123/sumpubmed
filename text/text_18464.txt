BACKGROUND
the engrailed homology  <dig>  motif is a short  region, initially found in engrailed  and other homeobox containing proteins, that mediates transcriptional repression via interaction with the wd <dig> repeat containing groucho   <cit> . shimeld  <cit>  proposed that the eh <dig> motif of smith and jaynes was shared with various forkhead  containing transcription factors. the short size of the motif, however, suggests that it may occur by chance in many different protein families. shimeld did not demonstrate statistically significant sequence similarity between the motifs from the homeobox- and forkhead-containing families. however, the human orthologs of groucho  have been shown to interact with foxa <dig> via a region of sequence containing an eh <dig> motif, clearly demonstrating the biological relevance of the sequence similarity  <cit> .

in this article i search systematically for instances of the eh <dig> motif in homeobox and forkhead containing genes and go on to demonstrate that the eh <dig> motif is also found in proteins containing t-box, doublesex motif  and zn finger domains. i show that within metazoan genomes, the observed association of the motif with transcription factor function is statistically significant. the location of the motif in members of the same transcription factor family is often non-homologous, occurring both n- and c-terminal to the dna binding domain, suggesting that the presence of the motif is, in part, due to convergent evolution, as proposed by shimeld; the conservation within orthologs points to many of these convergences predating the last common ancestor of the bilateria.

RESULTS
significant association of eh <dig> motif with transcription factor function
i searched for sequence motifs in homeobox containing transcription factors taken from the proteins of human, drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans, by first masking known pfam domains  <cit> , and then using the expectation maximization algorithm implemented in the meme program  <cit> . the first non-subfamily specific motif identified corresponded to previously known examples and new instances of, the eh <dig> motif , in  <dig> sites, with an e-value of < 10- <dig>  i then applied the same approach to forkhead containing transcription factors, identifying  <dig> sites with a combined e-value of < 10- <dig> . these motifs also appeared to conform to the consensus of the eh <dig> motif, as previously reported by shimeld  <cit> .

to further investigate the significance of this similarity, i constructed hidden markov models  of the motif  which i then searched against the complete set of predicted proteins from human, d. melanogaster &c. elegans. the highest scoring non homeobox containing domain match of eh1hox was a forkhead protein , and the second highest scoring non-forkhead containing match of eh1fh was to a homeobox containing protein . in both cases, nearly all the high scoring hits were to proteins containing domains with transcription factor function . among the best scoring matches of the eh1hox searches were several t-box , doublesex motif , zinc finger  and ets containing proteins   <cit> . excluding hits to homeobox containing proteins, but otherwise including all scores, the overall significance of the association of transcription factor function with higher scores to the eh1hox hmm is p < 10- <dig>  using a logistic regression model which tests association between score and transcription factor annotation . the association remains significant when scores derived from forkhead and pax domain containing proteins are also excluded . this indicates that, although the scores associated with any individual eh1-like motif may not be statistically significant, overall, we would not see so many eh1-like sequences co-occurring with dna binding domains if their co-occurrence were governed simply by chance – there is, therefore, likely to be a functional reason for these partnerships. in the following sections, i review the higher scoring associations detected here in the light of known gene functions.

eh <dig> motifs in homeobox and forkhead containing proteins
the presence of eh <dig> motifs within various homeobox, and to a lesser extent, forkhead containing proteins has been widely reported, although not systematically studied  <cit> . i found eh1-like motifs co-occurring with  <dig> major groupings of homeobox sub-types: the extended-hox class, typified by drosophila engrailed ; the paired class, including drosophila goosecoid , and the nk class, including drosophila tinman   <cit>  . related to the paired class homeobox domains, a number of genes containing paired domains only  were also found to contain eh1-like motifs . with only a few exceptions, outlined below, the eh1-like motif occurs n-terminal to the homeobox domain and c-terminal to the paired domain when present. a number of these proteins have been shown to interact with groucho or its orthologs e.g. c. elegans cog- <dig>  <cit> , vertebrate nkx proteins  <cit> , drosophila engrailed  and goosecoid   <cit> , and in high throughput assays drosophila invected  and and ladybird late   <cit> .

a handful of eh1-like motifs are found c-terminal to homeobox domains. of these, the best characterized is c. elegans unc- <dig>  which has been shown to interact with the groucho ortholog unc- <dig>  <cit> ; the drosophila ortholog unc- <dig> also interacts with groucho in high throughput experiments  <cit> . the c-terminal eh1-like motif is conserved in the closely related drosophila paralog odsh. the gene prediction for the human ortholog of unc- <dig>  appears to be artefactually truncated, but the mouse ortholog  and corrected human gene models, contain eh1-like motifs both n & c-terminal to the homeobox domain. taken together with the fact that in the majority of related homeobox containing proteins the eh1-like motifs are n-terminal, this suggests that the n-terminal motif has been lost in drosophila and c. elegans unc- <dig> orthologs.

eh1-like motifs also occur n- and c-terminal to forkhead domains. the n-terminal class consists of the sloppy-paired genes  of drosophila and orthologous or closely related sequences: human foxg <dig>  and drosophila cg9571; the c. elegans ortholog fkh- <dig> contains an eh1-like motif although a cysteine residue causes a low score. the c-terminal class consists of an apparent clade including the human foxa, foxb, foxc and foxd genes , although if the eh <dig> motif was present in the common ancestor of this clade, multiple losses must have later occurred . the situation is complicated somewhat by an eh1-like motif at the n-terminus of c. elegans unc- <dig> i.e. in the foxd like family. the eh <dig> motif in slp <dig> has been shown to interact with groucho  <cit> , and foxa type genes have been shown to interact with human groucho orthologs  <cit> .

eh <dig> motifs in novel domain contexts
assuming a conservative per-domain cutoff score of  <dig>  bits for true matches to the eh1hox model , yields hits to proteins containing t-box domains ; doublesex  domains  and c2h <dig> zinc fingers . also of note was a further match at  <dig>  bits, to an ets domain containing protein. prompted by these similarities i further investigated the presence of eh1-like motifs in these families, looking for high scoring matches to the eh1hox hmm that were conserved in closely related genes.

t-box containing proteins
i identified likely eh <dig> motifs co-occurring with t-box domains in two distinct contexts . the motif occurs c-terminal to the t-box in the drosophila dorsocross proteins doc <dig>  doc <dig> and doc <dig>  it is found n-terminal to the t-box in  <dig> proteins including mls- <dig> and mab- <dig> from c. elegans; h <dig>  mid/nmr <dig> and bi/omd from drosophila; in humans there are strong matches to tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> and more marginal matches to tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  although, to the best of my knowledge, none of these proteins has been shown to interact with groucho or its orthologs, several are known to act as transcriptional repressors: for instance, in murine heart development, tbx <dig> represses tbx <dig> which in turn represses nmyc  <cit> ; the dorsocross genes from drosophila repress wingless and ladybird  <cit> , and doc itself is repressed by mid/nmr <dig>  <cit> . the human proteins tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  and drosophila org- <dig> which are closely related to those above, do not appear to contain eh <dig> motifs. the human t  protein contains a motif broadly similar to the eh <dig> consensus: lqyrvdhllsa in a comparable n-terminal location to those found in other t-box containing proteins. although this motif scores poorly against eh1hox , the homologous regions from other t orthologs  provide a more persuasive case for the presence of a functioning eh <dig> motif in these proteins.

zinc finger containing proteins
the highest scoring match of eh1hox to a c2h <dig> zinc finger containing protein, was ces- <dig> from c. elegans ; this protein interacts with the groucho ortholog unc- <dig>  and can act as a repressor  <cit> . the putative eh <dig> motif is at the n-terminal end of ces- <dig>  in contrast, the drosophila proteins bowl and odd have eh1-like motifs at their c-terminal ends . in neither case is there direct evidence from high throughput studies of an interaction with groucho, but both can function as repressors  <cit> . the human protein znf <dig>  is the ortholog of zebrafish fezl, which contains an eh <dig> motif essential for repressor activity  <cit>  – this motif is conserved in the human paralog ensg <dig> and likely drosophila ortholog cg <dig>  .

doublesex motif containing proteins
the doublesex motif  was first found in proteins controlling sexual differentiation in drosophila. two dm containing proteins were confidently predicted to contain eh1-like motifs – human dmrt <dig> , and drosophila dmrt11e  – these are likely orthologs; a c. elegans protein, c27c <dig>  contained a weaker match  . the molecular function of these proteins is unknown.

other potential associations with transcription factor domains
although scoring less highly than some non-transcription factor hits, another intriguing association is with the ets domain. the three uncharatcerized c. elegans paralogs f19f <dig> , f19f <dig>  & c50a <dig>  contain c-terminal matches to the eh <dig> motifs , and two other ets proteins, c. elegans lin- <dig>  and drosophila eip74ef, both have relatively high scoring matches  . a high scoring protein that is not annotated as a transcription factor  is drosophila hairless  with a score of  <dig>  bits. experimental work has previously confirmed the presence of an eh1-like motif  within h that is responsible for its interaction with groucho  <cit> . the drosophila protein dorsal has been reported to interact with groucho via an eh1-like motif  <cit>  – this region  is markedly different to those reported here, having a low score against eh1hox  and so may better be regarded as a, so far, unique type of groucho interaction motif.

evolutionary considerations
convergent evolution
the eh <dig> motif is found n- and c-terminal to homeobox, forkhead, t-box and zn finger protein domains. clearly, as the locations of the eh <dig> motif are non-homologous, the n- and c-terminal associations must have occurred independently. the short size of the motif makes it tempting to speculate that the motif itself may have arisen independently . the strongest evidence for this is that, in general, the majority of domain combinations occur in a fixed n to c orientation, suggesting that recombination events combining domains are relatively rare  <cit> . the fact that we would here have many such events suggests that the alternative hypothesis of independent invention is more appropriate.

pre-bilaterian origins of association with different transcription factors
groucho is orthologous to the c. elegans unc- <dig> gene, and the four human paralogs tle1- <dig> . an ortholog is also found in the cnidarian hydra mangipapillata , and certain cnidarian homeobox containing genes also contain an eh1-like motif, suggesting groucho/eh <dig> mediated repression pre-dates the split between diplobasts and triplobasts; indeed, a sponge bar/bsh like homeobox containing protein   <cit>  also contains an eh1-like motif, as does paxb from the non-bilaterian placozoan trichoplax adhaerens  <cit>  and a tlx-like protein from a ctenophore , suggesting the repression system was in place in the earliest animals . i find high scoring eh1-like motifs in forkhead domain containing proteins from sponges, cnidarians and ctenophores, in both the c-terminal   and n-terminal  varieties . the presumed ortholog of 't' from the trichoplax adhaerens  <cit>  contains an eh1-like motif . these results suggest that groucho mediated repression using a variety of transcription factors was widespread in the last common ancestor of the metazoa.

CONCLUSIONS
candidate eh <dig> motifs exist in combination with a variety of transcription factor domains, suggesting that these proteins have roles as repressors of transcriptional activity. the distribution of the eh <dig> motif is suggestive of a number of instances of convergent evolution, although in many cases the motif has been conserved throughout bilaterian orthologs. together with the existence of a cnidarian groucho ortholog, this leads to the conclusion that eh1/groucho mediated repression was established prior to the evolution of bilateria.
