BACKGROUND
site-specific methyl-directed dna endonuclease glai is the most interesting enzyme among new bacterial endonucleases, which cleave recognition sites with 5-methylcytosines and don't cut unmodified dna  <cit> . glai substrates have been studied in details and include methylated dna sequences 5'-pugpy-3'/3'-pygpu-5'and 5'-gpu-3'/3'-gpyg-5'  <cit> .

previously, we studied a cleavage of total mouse dna with restriction endonucleases  <cit> . we compared the experimental patterns of dna hydrolysis with calculated diagrams of genomic dna fragments distribution, which had been obtained by computer analysis, and found a good correspondence  <cit> . we showed that patterns of mouse dna hydrolysis were formed mainly by products of line <dig> repeats and γ-satellite dna cleavage. because of high proportion of γ-satellite dna in a total mouse dna preparation the bands, which correspond to products of γ-satellite dna cleavage, were seen much better in electrophoresis gels  <cit> . we cut mouse dna with site-specific methyl-directed dna endonucleases and observed dna hydrolysis with glai only  <cit> .

in this work we have undertaken a detailed study of mouse dna cleavage with glai and analyzed a primary structure of γ-satellite dna and methylation status of acgt sites within it.

RESULTS
γ-satellite dna digestion with glai
earlier we carried out a hydrolysis of total mouse dna by restriction endonucleases and site-specific methyl-directed dna endonucleases with subsequent separation of the reaction products by gel-electrophoresis  <cit> . a theoretical analysis of mouse genomic dna digestion at recognition sequences of corresponding restriction endonucleases with subsequent construction of dna fragments distribution diagrams has been performed and has shown a presence of peaks, which correspond mainly to products of line <dig> repeats cleavage  <cit> . a comparison of observed experimental results and calculation data has demonstrated a good coincidence, except presence of additional bright bands in the experimental cleavage patterns. these bands correspond to monomer and dimer of γ-satellite dna  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively  <cit> . a proportion of γ-satellite dna in a total mouse dna preparation is about 8%  <cit>  and higher than in total dna preparations from rat and human  <cit> . this peculiarity allows us to use a total mouse dna preparation in the experiments on study of mouse γ-satellite dna hydrolysis.

to analyze products of mouse γ-satellite dna cleavage we have used gel-electrophoresis in paag and low melting point agarose. figure  <dig> shows patterns of total mouse dna cleavage with restriction enzymes sse9i, fati, bst2ui and methyl-directed site-specific dna endonuclease glai. in accordance with earlier published data  <cit>  dna hydrolysis with restriction enzymes results in formation of the bands, which correspond to dna fragments  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp and represent monomer and dimer of mouse γ-satellite dna  <cit> . glai digestion pattern also contains a monomeric γ-satellite dna fragment. however, unlike other enzyme, glai produces a number of shorter fragments, clearly visible in the gel photograph, and this picture is not changed after additional glai treatment . comparing to dna ladder, the lengths of dna fragments in pattern of glai cleavage have been estimated  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, where the last one is a length of monomeric γ-satellite dna. in our previous work on mouse dna hydrolysis with restriction endonucleases we have shown that dna fragments less than  <dig> bp are mostly the products of γ-satellite dna cleavage   <cit> . data on figure  <dig> show that an intensity of  <dig> bp fragment in glai pattern is weaker and  <dig> bp band is missing if compared to other runs. this result corresponds to formation of short fragments in pattern of glai digestion from γ-satellite dna.

location of glai digestion fragments
to confirm the origin of dna fragments in pattern of glai digestion and to determine their primary structure all five dna bands have been eluted from gel and cloned into puc <dig>  dna insertions of  <dig> plasmids have been sequenced. primary structures of  <dig> insertions correspond to dna sequence of consensus monomeric γ-satellite dna  <cit> , which is given in figure  <dig> 

according to this consensus sequence, the recognition sites of restriction enzymes bst2ui , fati  and sse9i  are located in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of γ-satellite dna, respectively. in a course of γ-satellite dna hydrolysis with these enzymes monomer and multimers are formed . analysis of consensus dna sequence  with methylated cg dinucleotides has shown that only three glai recognition sites with nucleotide sequence acgt are present in the main monomeric γ-satellite dna in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

in figure  <dig> we have presented a diagram with location of all  <dig> sequenced fragments in monomeric γ-satellite dna based on their primary structure and positions of glai recognition sites. thus, we have determined dna sequence of six insertions from lower  <dig> bp band , fourteen insertions of  <dig> bp band , six  <dig> bp insertions , seven  <dig> bp insertions  from  <dig> bp band and six  <dig> bp fragments. this set includes all possible dna fragments with a length of  <dig> bp and less, which are produced in the course of limited glai hydrolysis of γ-satellite dna at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  except a monomer 207– <dig>  a primary structure of all  <dig> sequenced fragments and their alignment are presented in additional file  <dig> . data in additional file  <dig> show that in all cases glai cleaves only acgt sites in position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  so, we haven't observed any non-specific hydrolysis of γ-satellite dna with glai.

incomplete hydrolysis of acgt sites in γ-satellite dna
as can be seen from a map in figure  <dig>  a complete hydrolysis of fully methylated γ-satellite dna should produce only three dna fragments:  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. these fragments correspond to the bottom bands  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in figure  <dig>  taking into account a double intensity of the last one.

however, experimental pattern of glai hydrolysis  includes three additional bands  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, which are a result of partial hydrolysis of γ-satellite dna because of mutations  <cit>  and undermethylation  <cit>  of acgt sites. a ratio of molar intensities of dna bands obtained in glai cleavage pattern  has been determined as  <dig>  :  <dig>  :  <dig>  :  <dig>  :  <dig> 

according to sequencing data of the cloned insertions,  <dig> bp dna fragment corresponds to  <dig> bp band,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp dna fragments are presented in  <dig> bp band and  <dig> bp is a monomeric γ-satellite dna.

in table  <dig> we have summarized data on dna fragments, which contain unmethylated and mutated glai recognition sequence. there are approximately 24%, 30% and 2% mutated sites in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. additionally, 3%, 7% and 50% of unmethylated sites have been found in the same positions. the last data correspond to earlier published results on 50% methylation of cg dinucleotide in position  <dig>  whereas other cg dinucleotides  are extensively methylated  <cit> . in total, 27%, 37% and 52% of tetranucleotides at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, are resistant against glai hydrolysis and corresponding probabilities of these positions cleavage are 73%, 63% and 48%. based on the probability data we have calculated a ratio of molar intensities of dna bands obtained in glai cleavage  as  <dig>  :  <dig>  :  <dig>  :  <dig>  :  <dig>  a comparison of these calculations and molar intensities of dna bands in experiment has shown a similarity of both ratios.

a double digestion of mouse γ-satellite dna with glai and restriction enzymes
we have carried out the experiments on double digestion of mouse dna with glai and some restriction endonucleases, which have a unique recognition site in γ-satellite dna. these restriction endonucleases are bst2ui , acsi , fati  and bstf5i . the photos of double digestions experiments are provided in figure 5a. a restriction map of mouse γ-satellite dna monomer from position  <dig> to + <dig> is provided in figure 5b. this map includes positions of dna cleavage with glai and restriction endonucleases with indication of the obtained fragments and their calculated lengths. as can be seen from figure 5a, double digestions result in a disappearance of those fragments, which contain restriction enzymes' sites. a treatment of glai digestion products with acsi  results in hydrolysis of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp dna fragments. a new fragment  <dig> bp is a result of  <dig> bp dna fragment cleavage. a double digestion with fati  destroys all upper fragment of glai cleavage pattern but leads to formation of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp dna fragments. the appearance of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp fragments restores an original picture of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp bands in dna cleavage pattern and we can see a new  <dig> bp fragment, which is cut off  <dig> bp fragment. a similar picture with hydrolysis of all upper fragments of glai cleavage pattern is observed with bstf5i double digestion . a new fragments  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp are appeared in digestion products and clearly seen in gel photo. a double digestion of γ-satellite dna with glai and bst2ui  results in digestion of  <dig> bp fragment with formation of two small fragments  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. so, the experimental data on double digestion of γ-satellite dna with glai and restriction endonucleases are coincided with calculated positions of cleavage sites in a physical map.

primary structure of γ-satellite dna
to study a primary structure of γ-satellite dna in detail, we have cloned additionally  <dig> bp fragments of asps9i and sse9i digestions of mouse γ-satellite dna  <cit> .  <dig> insertions of each digestion have been sequenced. six sse9i fragments and seven asps9i fragments share homology with mouse γ-satellite dna. these  <dig> sequences have been aligned with a consensus sequence of monomeric γ-satellite dna and are presented in additional file  <dig>  along with primary structures of glai hydrolysis fragments. in total, sequencing data of  <dig> fragments of γ-satellite dna are provided in additional file  <dig>  a primary structure of consensus monomeric γ-satellite dna is given beneath all sequences . we haven't observed a mutation of cg dinucleotide in position  <dig> in all  <dig> analyzed fragments, whereas we have  <dig>  mutations of cg dinucleotide in position  <dig> and  <dig>  – in position  <dig> 

earlier, vissel and choo cleaved a mouse γ-satellite dna with mnli, cloned  <dig> obtained fragments of monomeric γ-satellite dna and sequenced insertions of the corresponding plasmids  <cit> . we have aligned these sequences and provided a consensus primary structure in additional file  <dig> 

a search for monomeric γ-satellite dna in the reference mouse genome sequence  has been made and two small blocks of γ-satellite dna monomers have been revealed in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  locations and a primary structure of  <dig> sequences from the monomers block in chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> sequences from the monomers block in chromosome  <dig> are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. we have determined consensus sequences of γ-satellite dna monomers for both blocks and placed them in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> as well. in table  <dig> we have summarized data on mutations of cg dinucleotide in all  <dig> positions in a)  <dig> fragments of γ-satellite dna from additional file  <dig>  b)  <dig> monomers of γ-satellite dna from additional file 2), c)  <dig> monomers in chromosome  <dig> from additional file  <dig> and d)  <dig> monomers in chromosome  <dig> from additional file  <dig>

discussion
according to a primary structure of consensus sequence of γ-satellite dna  <cit> , there are three glai recognition sites 5'-agt-3'/3'-tga-3' within monomeric dna in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  patterns of a total dna hydrolysis with asps9i and bstsci have shown that products of γ-satellite dna digestion have a molar concentration at least  <dig> times more than a concentration of line <dig> repeats digestions  <cit> . because of such difference in dna concentration we have used a total mouse dna preparation in study of γ-satellite dna cleavage with glai. the obtained cleavage pattern corresponds to a limited hydrolysis of γ-satellite dna with glai due to mutations of acgt sites and undermethylation of cg dinucleotides.

results of double digestion of γ-satellite dna with glai and restriction endonucleases acsi, bst2ui, bstf5i and fati have confirmed positions of enzymes' recognition sites and locations of small  and intermediate  glai digestion fragments in monomeric γ-satellite dna.

hydrolysis of γ-satellite dna with hpych4iv and sspi has provided similar patterns of evenly distributed dna fragments, which are monomers, dimers, trimers, etc. . however, the reasons of such specific digestion of γ-satellite dna with these restriction enzymes are different. incomplete hydrolysis of γ-satellite dna with sspi is explained by mutation of the enzyme recognition sequence  <cit> , whereas hpych4iv cleaves γ-satellite dna due to undermethylation of acgt site in position  <dig> .

consensus sequences of γ-satellite dna fragments obtained in our work  and published earlier  <cit>  are coinciding. surprisingly, a consensus sequence, which has been determined for  <dig> monomeric γ-satellite dna fragments sequenced in the work of vissel and choo , differs in two positions from a known one  <cit>  .

vissel and choo cleaved γ-satellite dna with mnli and determined a primary structure of obtained monomers  <cit> . earlier horz and altenburger  <cit>  studied mnli digestion of γ-satellite dna and showed that methylation of cg dinucleotide in position  <dig> blocks dna hydrolysis. so, vissel and choo isolated only those dna monomers, which were unmethylated in position  <dig> in two neighbouring mnli sites. besides a distinct consensus sequence, a detailed analysis of these monomers alignment  has revealed a different distribution of cg dinucleotide mutations in several positions of γ-satellite dna .

in our study we have observed  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 0% mutations of cg dinucleotide in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . data of vissel and choo show that all  <dig> sequenced fragments don't have mutations in position  <dig> and have only one mutation of cg dinucleotide in position  <dig>  on the other hand, there are 20% mutations of cg dinucleotide in position  <dig>  an absence of cg dinucleotide mutations in position  <dig> may be explained, at least partially, by overlapping position  <dig> of this dinucleotide with mnli recognition sequence. a discrepancy of cg dinucleotides mutations in position  <dig> in two works is a consequence of either a very special selection of dna fragments in a work of vissel and choo  or different sources of dna . nevertheless, both works demonstrate maximum cg dinucleotides mutations in position  <dig>  and in position  <dig> . moreover, there is a similar distribution of mutations in these cg dinucleotides: mostly mutated g in position  <dig> and roughly equal mutated c and g in positions  <dig> and  <dig> 

in this work we have confirmed data on large proportion of γ-satellite dna in a total mouse dna preparation  <cit> . vissel and choo isolated γ-satellite dna from a total dna and studied its structure. according to their data γ-satellite dna is organized into long uninterrupted arrays of between  <dig>  monomers and greater than  <dig>  monomers, likely, located near chromosome centromers  <cit> .

so, γ-satellite dna is a prolonged dna and constitutes a significant part of total dna. however, we could not find peaks of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in diagrams of genomic dna digestion with restriction enzymes, which have one recognition site in γ-satellite dna monomer  <cit> . in fact, the most of γ-satellite dna is not presented in the known databases  <cit> . nevertheless, in genomic database there are small blocks of sequenced γ-satellite dna, which contain 10– <dig> monomers  <cit> . dna sequences of γ-satellite monomers from two such blocks, which are located in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  have been aligned in this work . consensus sequences of γ-satellite dna of these two blocks are almost identical and differ in nucleotides in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  however, both of them have three identical differences from consensus sequence of arrayed γ-satellite dna : a instead of g in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  t instead of a in position  <dig>  besides, cg dinucleotide in position  <dig> and in position  <dig> has become ca dinucleotide in consensus sequences of γ-satellite dna in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a change of g for a in position  <dig> destroys one of three acgt sites and consensus sequence of γ-satellite dna in both blocks of monomers contains only two glai recognition sites in positions  <dig> and  <dig> 

a comparison of table  <dig> data between rows  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> shows a significant difference of cg dinucleotide mutations in γ-satellite dna from arrays and in small blocks of monomers. we can see more mutation in all  <dig> positions of cg dinucleotides in the case of blocks of γ-satellite dna monomers if compare to cg dinucleotides in arrayed γ-satellite dna. table  <dig> shows that in arrayed γ-satellite dna there is at least one conservative cg dinucleotide, whereas γ-satellite dna from blocks of monomers doesn't have a conservative cg dinucleotide in any positions.

absence of mutations  and 50% methylation  of cg dinucleotide in position  <dig> allow to say about important role of this cg dinucleotide methylation/demethylation in function of arrayed γ-satellite dna from mouse liver.

CONCLUSIONS
hydrolysis of total dna from mouse liver with new site-specific methyl-directed endonuclease glai provides a clear digestion pattern, which corresponds to a partial cleavage of γ-satellite dna at methylated acgt sites in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  determination of primary structure of  <dig> obtained dna fragment has confirmed data on extensive modification of cg dinucleoitide in positions  <dig> and  <dig> but only 50% modification in position  <dig>  study of  <dig> sequenced fragments of γ-satellite dna has shown that cg dinucleotide in position  <dig> is highly conservative and its methylation/demethylation is, likely, important for function of γ-satellite dna arrays.

consensus sequence of arrayed γ-satellite dna is coincided with earlier published one and differs from a consensus sequence of γ-satellite dna in small  monomers blocks.
