BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells were first derived from the blastocysts of mice in  <dig>  <cit>  and humans in  <dig>  <cit> . es cells have two important properties: theability to maintain pluripotency, which is the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells, and rapid proliferation. these characteristics make mouse es cells an essential component of gene targeting technology. these qualitiesalso make human es cells attractive sources for cell transplantation therapy to treat various diseases, including spinal cord injuries and juvenile diabetes. the molecular mechanisms underlying the pluripotency and rapid proliferation of es cells are currently a major focus of the field of stem cell biology  <cit> .

to identify molecules essential in es cells for these properties, several groups have utilized transcriptome analyses to identify genes specifically expressed in es cells and early embryos. these analyses, including dna microarray analyses  <cit>  and expressed sequence tag analyses  <cit> , identified several common transcripts, including esg <dig> that was also designated dppa <dig> or ecat <dig> 

esg <dig> was originally identified as a transcript ph <dig> that was down-regulated by retinoic acid in embryonic carcinoma cells  <cit> . the expression of this gene was confined in mice to early embryos and germ cells  <cit> . it is also expressed in pluripotent cells, including es cells, embryonic germ cells, and multipotent germline stem cells  <cit> . esg <dig> encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids that contains a single kh domain, which is an rna-binding domain  <cit> . it remains unclear, however, if esg <dig> functions as an rna-binding protein or the roles it plays in es cells and mice.

previous genomic library screening by identified genomic clones containing the mouse esg <dig> gene and seven pseudogenes  <cit> . two of these pseudogenes exhibit a similar exon-intron structure as the esg <dig> gene, indicating their generation by gene duplication. the five remaining pseudogenes did not contain any introns, indicating that these were generated by retrotransposition of esg <dig> transcripts. the chromosomal localizations of the mouse esg <dig> gene and pseudogenes, however, have not been reported.

in this study, we determined the structure of the mouse gene encoding this protein and related pseudogenes. we also performed gene targeting to determine the physiological function of esg <dig> 

RESULTS
chromosomal localization and structures of mouse esg <dig> gene and psedogenes
to determine the chromosomal localizations of the mouse esg <dig> gene and pseudogenes, we performed a blast analysis of the mouse genomic database with the esg <dig> cdna sequence as a query. we identified several putative pseudogenes without introns on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and x . in addition, two intron-less pseudogenes were identified in dna fragments for which the chromosomal localization remained unmapped. while these pseudodgenes have significant homology to esg <dig> cdna, they could not produce functional proteins, because of critical mutations. this result suggests that there are a larger number of intron-less pseudogenes than previously anticipated. existence of multiple retropseudogenes is a hallmark of pluripotent cell-specific genes  <cit> .

on chromosome  <dig>  we identified a dna fragment similar to the esg <dig> gene that included two putative introns. these putative first and second exons, however, contained  multiple mutations of the esg <dig> cdna sequence. the putative third exon was identical to that of the previously reported esg <dig> gene. also on chromosome  <dig>  we identified another dna fragment that was similar, but not identical, to the third exon of the esg <dig> gene. these findings suggest that these esg1-like sequences on chromosome  <dig> have not been correctly assembled.

to obtain dna fragments containing the esg <dig> gene, we screened the bacterial artificial chromosome  dna pool by pcr using primer pairs that would only amplify the real gene, not the pseudogenes. we obtained two independent, but overlapping bac clones. southern blot analyses and sequencing demonstrated that these clones contained a sequence exhibiting complete identity with esg <dig> cdna that was interrupted by two putative introns . the two intron sequences begin with gt and terminate with ag, fulfilling the gt-ag rule of exon-intron junctions  <cit> . the 5' flanking region of this dna fragment exhibited strong promoter/enhancer activity by luciferase reporter assays in undifferentiated es cells, but not in somatic cells . the same fragment showed much weaker activity after induction of differentiation by retinoic acid. we concluded that this sequence is the esg <dig> gene.

we also found that the two bac clones contained another esg1-like sequence . the two sequences, separated by a  <dig> kbp intergenic sequence, were oriented in opposite directions. the esg1-like sequence exhibited greater than 95% identity to the exons and introns of the esg <dig> gene. this sequence, however, contained critical nucleotide substitutions in all of the exons and one nucleotide insertion in exon  <dig> . although  <dig> base pairs of the 3' flanking regions were conserved between the esg <dig> gene and the pseudogene, only five base pairs of the 5' flanking region were identical. this 5' flanking region  did not possess any promoter/enhancer activity in luciferase reporter assays . it is thus unlikely that this sequence is transcribed or translated into a functional protein. this sequence likely represents a duplication pseudogene. bierbaum previously reported the existence of two pseudogenes with similar exon-intron organization as the esg <dig> gene  <cit> . we could not determine which of these two pseudogenes corresponds to the one we identified or the location of the remaining pseudogene.

targeted disruption of the mouse esg <dig> gene
to study the function of esg <dig>  we deleted the gene by homologous recombination in mouse es cells. we replaced the three exons with either a fusion of the neomycin-resistance and β-galactosidase genes  or the hygromycin resistant gene  using two targeting vectors  introduced into rf <dig> es cells by electroporation. we obtained eight es cell clones with correct homologous recombination of the β-geo targeting vector, which was confirmed by southern blot analysis . we obtained only one clone with correct homologous recombination of the hygr targeting vector.

to obtain homozygous mutant es cells, we introduced the β-geo vector into hygr heterozygous es cells. of  <dig> g418-resistant colonies tested,  <dig> were homozygous for esg <dig> deletion. northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of esg <dig> in these cells . in  <dig> clones, the β-geo vector had replaced the hygr vector, such that the cells remained heterozygous. in the remaining  <dig> clones, the β-geo vector was integrated at non-homologous sites.

esg1-/- es cells exhibited normal morphology . these cells also proliferated at a speed comparable to that of the control  cells . esg1-/- cells differentiated normally after the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor  or retinoic acid treatment . when transplanted into hind flanks of nude mice, these cells produced teratomas, tumors containing components of all three germ layers . these results indicate that esg <dig> is dispensable for the self-renewal properties and pluripotency of es cells.

we examined the gene expression profiles of esg1-/- es cells using oligonucleotide-based dna microarrays representing ~ <dig>  genes. in comparison to control es cells, esg <dig> was identified as the gene reduced to the greatest extent in esg1-/- es cells . the expression of es cell marker genes, such as nanog and oct3/ <dig>  was normal in esg1-/- es cells. we confirmed normal oct3/ <dig> expression at protein levels by western blot . the overall gene expression profiles were similar between control es cells and esg1-/- es cells. several genes exhibited a greater than two-fold reduction in esg1-/- cells, including krt1- <dig>  pem, ctgf, ptgs <dig>  igf <dig> and inhba. these genes might be regulated directly or indirectly by esg <dig>  since esg <dig> contains a kh-type rna-binding domain, it may stabilize mrna of these genes. further studied are required to clarify this possibility.

to generate esg1-knockout mice, we injected β-geo-esg1+/- es cell clones into the blastocysts of c57bl <dig> mice. we obtained germline transmission from three clones. we obtained esg1-/- mice at the mendelian ratios  from intercrosses of esg1+/- mice. these animals exhibited normal development, gross appearance, and fertility . histological examination of testis and ovary could not identify any abnormalities . these data demonstrated that esg <dig> is dispensable for both mouse development and germ cell formation.

we also generated es cells from blastocysts obtained by intercrosses of esg1+/- males and esg1-/- females. of the eight es cell lines established, two clones were esg1-/-. these esg1-null es cells demonstrated normal morphology, proliferation, and differentiation , confirming that esg <dig> is dispensable in es cells.

CONCLUSIONS
to analyze the physiological roles of esg <dig>  we identified the mouse gene on chromosome  <dig> and deleted it by homologous recombination in es cells. despite specific expression in early embryos, germ cells, and pluripotent cells, our data demonstrated that esg <dig> is dispensable for mouse development, germ cell formation, and es cell self-renewal.
