BACKGROUND
flowering, maturity and plant height in plants are complex traits controlled by internal and external factors. they considerably impact the adaptability, biomass and economic yield in agricultural crops. the genetic signaling pathways of flowering have been well characterized in arabidopsis, a model organism in plant biology. the floral integrator genes flowering locus t  and suppressor of overexpression of constans  <dig>  play a central role in flowering regulation. they promote the expression of a group of floral meristem identity genes such as apetala  <dig> , leafy  and cauliflower  to initiate the floral transition of the plant  <cit> . in the floral pathway, upstream of ft and soc <dig> are flowering locus c  and constans , which are two key regulators of floral integrators but in different manners. in arabidopsis, a high level of flc represses expression of both ft and soc <dig>  and it can be released by vernalization treatment or autonomous development process  <cit> . co is circadian-regulated and involved in the photoperiod pathway through promoting expression of ft and soc <dig>  <cit> . additionally, more genes involved in the inductive photoperiod pathway, the vernalization pathway, the autonomous pathway and the gibberellins pathway have been characterized in arabidopsis  <cit> .

soybean  is a major crop of agronomic importance grown across a wide range of latitudes from 50°n to 35°s  <cit> . however, every soybean cultivar adapts to a limited latitudinal region because of photoperiod sensitivity. days to flowering  and maturity  and plant height  are important traits related to soybean adaptability and productivity  <cit> . dtm represents the entire duration of growth and development, consisting of two periods: dtf and duration of flowering-to-maturity . all the four traits are quantitatively inherited in soybean. previous studies identified nine major-effect loci affecting flowering and maturity in soybean, which have been designated as e <dig> to e <dig>  and the j locus for “long juvenile period”  <cit> . of these genes, e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> have been map-based cloned and functionally characterized. e <dig> encodes a nuclear-localized b <dig> domain-containing protein, which is induced by long day conditions and is inversely related to both gmft2a and gmft5a expression  <cit> , two ft orthologs promoting early flowering in soybean  <cit> . e <dig> encodes a homolog of gigantea, which regulates expression of co and ft in arabidopsis, and controls soybean flowering through regulating gmft2a but not gmft5a  <cit> . e <dig> and e <dig> encode phytochrome a  proteins gmphya <dig> and gmphya <dig>  respectively  <cit> . loss-of-function alleles of e <dig>  e <dig> or e <dig> lead to photoperiod insensitivity and promote early flowering under long day conditions  <cit> , which are important for soybean plants, a typical short-day crop, to adapt to high-latitude environments. in addition to these major loci, many minor-effect quantitative traits loci  related to soybean flowering and maturity have also been identified . recently, comparative genomic analyses revealed that there are a large number of soybean orthologs of arabidopsis flowering genes  <cit> , suggesting a complex genetic basis of flowering and maturity in soybean.

overlaps between ph loci and maturity loci have been observed in soybean  <cit> , indicating that ph and maturity might share a similar genetic basis to some extent. previous research showed that stem termination affected both stem elongation and maturity in soybean, and the gene determinate stem  <dig>  plays a primary role in soybean determination  <cit> . determinate soybean plants cease stem elongation through initiating floral transition of the shoot apical meristem  soon after photoperiod-induced floral transition. in arabidopsis, stem elongation is regulated through cell wall component modification, phytohormone- and light-regulated development  <cit> . to date, at least  <dig> qtls associated with ph have been reported across all the  <dig> chromosomes in soybean . however, limited knowledge of genes conditioning soybean stem elongation is available.

genome-wide association study  using high-density markers and a population of non-cross-derived lines provides higher mapping resolution than conventional qtl mapping based on cross-derived segregating populations, and enables one to predict or identify causal genes. gwas has been widely used to dissect complex traits in some major crops, e.g., maize and rice  <cit> . however, there are very few reports of gwas with high-density single nucleotide polymorphism  in soybean  <cit> . thus the application of gwas in soybean, a highly self-pollinated crop with complex genome structure, remains to be explored, especially for agronomic traits.

to better understand the genetic architecture of dtf, dtm, dftm and ph in soybean, we conducted a gwas for these traits in a population consisting of  <dig> plant introductions  with  <dig>  snps. many new loci and previously reported loci were identified for each trait. candidate genes with known function or arabidopsis orthologs were also proposed. this study enriches our knowledge of the genetic basis underlying dtf, dtm, dftm and ph in soybean and provides valuable markers for molecular breeding of soybean.

methods
plant materials and field trials
three hundred and nine accessions, obtained from the usda soybean germplasm collection, were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications on the agricultural research farms of south dakota state university at three locations: aurora , brookings  and watertown , sd. according to the germplasm resources information network , most of the pis originate from china, and 90% are maturity group   <dig> and the rest are mg  <dig> . they mainly adapt to the upper midwest in the united states and the southern region in canada.

phenotypic evaluation and statistical analysis
dtf and dtm were recorded in the field as the number of days from planting to the date when 50% of the plants in a plot had showed the first flower and when 95% of the pods had ripened as indicated by mature pod color, respectively. dftm was calculated as the difference between dtm and dtf . ph was the average of four measurements per plot, and each measurement was recorded as the length of main stem from the ground to the top extremity of the plant at maturity. the model for the phenotypic trait was yijk = μ + gi + lj + ij + bk + eijk, where μ is the total mean, gi is the genetic effect of the ith genotype, lj is the effect of the jth environment, ij is the interaction effect between the ith genotype and the jth environment, bk is the block effect within the jth environment, and eijk is a random error following n. broad heritability on an entry-mean basis was calculated as h2 = σ2g/, where σ2g is the genotypic variance, σ2gl is the genotype by environment interaction variance, k is the number of environments, r is the number of replications. estimation of variance components was performed by the varcomp procedure in sas version  <dig>   with all effects considered to be random. to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by the mixed linear model  containing all identified loci, the likelihood-ratio-based r <dig> was calculated for each trait  <cit> .

genotyping and quality control
the illumina infinium soysnp50k beadchip was used to genotype the population as described in a previous study  <cit> , and  <dig>  snps were identified with a call success rate of 85% or greater. of them,  <dig> snps that were presented in unanchored sequence scaffolds were excluded from further analyses. the dataset had a missing rate of  <dig> %. markers with missing rate larger than 10% were ruled out and the remaining missing data were imputed using beagle version  <dig> . <dig> with default parameter settings  <cit> . snps with a minor allele frequency  < 5% after imputation were excluded from further analyses as well. finally, a total of  <dig>  snps were used for gwas.

linkage disequilibrium estimation
pairwise ld between markers was calculated as squared correlation coefficient  of alleles using r package synbreed  <cit> . in light of substantial difference in recombination rate between euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, r <dig> was calculated separately for the two chromosomal regions. the physical length of euchromatin and heterochromatin on each chromosome were defined as in soybase . only r <dig> for snps with pairwise distance less than 10 mb in either euchromatic or heterochromatic region of each chromosome were used to draw the average ld decay figure by r script using the equation described in a previous study  <cit> . the ld decay rate of the population was measured as the chromosomal distance where the average r <dig> dropped to half its maximum value  <cit> .

genome-wide association analysis
to minimize the effects of environmental variation, best linear unbiased predictors  of individual lines were calculated for each trait using the r package lme <dig>  <cit> , and were then used to fit the one-way anova model for naive test  implemented in r  <dig> . <dig>  and mlm implemented in the gapit r package  <cit> . the latter takes both familial relatedness and population structure into account.

for the naive test, the equation was y=μ+xα+e. 

for the mlm analysis, the equation was y=μ+xα+pβ+zu+e, 

where y is the phenotype blups of each line, μ is the total mean, x is the incidence matrix relating the individuals to the fixed marker effects α, p is the incidence matrix relating the individuals to the fixed principal component  effects β, and z is the incidence matrix relating the individuals to the random group effects u obtained from the compression algorithm. the random group effects u follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean  <dig> and variance-covariance matrix 2kvg, where k is the kinship matrix, and vg is the polygenic variance. the random error term e follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean  <dig> and variance-covariance matrix ive, where i is the identity matrix and ve is the error variance component. the optimal number of pcs to be involved in the mlm was determined by bayesian information criterion of the model .

for association analysis of dtf and dtm, regular mlm  was suggested by gapit. for ph, the results between the regular mlm and compressed mlm  were very similar, thus a regular mlm  was adopted too. while for dftm, a k model was not applicable  and regular mlm  could not detect significant association, thus cmlm  with a compression level of  <dig>  was used as suggested by gapit . the threshold of significance for snp-trait associations was determined by the false discovery rate  <  <dig>  or the empirical significance level at p <  <dig> , whichever was more stringent. to assess the empirical significance of snps, we performed  <dig>  permutations of genome-wide association analyses. since we could not find appropriate permutation for k + p model, permutation was conducted for k model only, which was used for association analysis of dtf, dtm and ph as described above. for each iteration, the phenotype values and kinship matrix  in the mlm remained unchanged, while genotypes of each snp were permuted. briefly, we shuffled the rows randomly but kept the order of row names unchanged in a genotypic data file where each column represented one snp and each row represented one germplasm accession. gapit was run with the same parameter setting as the original test for each trait. this method preserves the association between the phenotypes and k but eliminates the association between the snp and p . as a result, we applied it to the k model only but not to the k + p model.

prediction of candidate genes
genes annotated in glyma <dig> , glyma <dig>  and ncbi refseq gene models in soybase  were used as the source of candidate genes. the prediction of candidate genes was referred to the following preferences: i) genes of known function in soybean related to the trait under study, ii) genes with function-known orthologs in arabidopsis related to the trait under study, and iii) genes pinpointed by the peak snps.

RESULTS
statistics of phenotypes
analysis of variance indicated that the effects of genotypes, environments, and their interactions were significant for all the four traits except the g × e interaction for ph . averaged over three environments, all traits showed a large variation, especially for ph where a four-fold difference was observed. the frequency distribution skewed towards early flowering for dtf but approximated a normal distribution for the other three traits . there were high correlations between different environments, ranging from  <dig>   for dftm between 2011 au and 2012wt to  <dig>   for dtf between 2011 au and 2012bk. accordingly, a high heritability  was estimated for each trait, indicating that genetic effects play a predominant role in the performance of the traits . however, the correlations between traits were low to moderate . interestingly, dtf was positively correlated to dtm  while negatively correlated to dftm .table  <dig>

distribution of markers and linkage disequilibrium
a total of  <dig>  snps with maf ≥  <dig>  were used for further analyses after quality control, with an average marker density of  <dig> snp every 29 kb genome-wide, varying across chromosomes from  <dig>  kb/snp on chromosome  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb/snp on gm <dig> . most  of the snps were harbored within euchromatic regions where 78% of putative genes are located  <cit> , resulting in an average marker density of  <dig> snp per 20 kb in euchromatin and  <dig> snp per 62 kb in heterochromatin. using the whole set of snps, the ld decay rate of the population was estimated at 326 kb in euchromatin, where r2 =  <dig>   . in heterochromatin, however, r <dig> did not drop to half of its maximum value until  <dig>  kb.figure  <dig>

 <dig> dropped to half of its maximum value.



gwas of traits
gwas was conducted by using the blups of individual performance over three environments in a mlm, which accounts for both population structure and familial relatedness  <cit> . as shown in quantile-quantile plots , the genomic inflation was considerably controlled in mlms versus the naive model .

in total  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps significantly associated with dtf, dtm, dftm and ph were identified, respectively . twenty-eight  and  <dig>  of the  <dig> snps associated with dtf and  <dig>  of  <dig> snps associated with dftm were located in the extensive ld blocks in the heterochromatic regions with physical length of  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively . to determine the trait-associated loci, all significant snps located in close physical proximity were clumped at r2 >  <dig>  and only the strongest trait-associated snp  within each ld block was kept, except in the case of the extensive ld blocks where multiple peak snps were found. finally,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci associated with dtf, dtm, dftm and ph were identified across the  <dig> chromosomes . the final model containing these loci explained  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of phenotypic variation for dtf, dtm, dftm and ph, respectively.figure  <dig>

some loci were found to be associated with multiple traits. the locus at the  <dig>  mb position on gm <dig>  representing the strongest association for ph, was also associated with dtm. it explained 15% and  <dig> % of total phenotypic variation for ph and dtm, respectively. on average, the lines carrying the major frequency allele of the peak snp  at this locus were  <dig>  cm taller and matured  <dig>  days later than those with the alternative allele . the locus at the  <dig>  mb position on gm <dig> was associated with both dtf and dftm, but their effects were in opposite directions. two loci at  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb positions on gm <dig> were detected for both dtm and dftm with similar effects. no overlap was found between loci of dtf and dtm.figure  <dig>

prediction of candidate genes
based on the results of gwas and genes annotated in soybase , we further predicted candidate causal genes for loci significantly associated with each trait. a total of  <dig> candidate genes were predicted for  <dig> of the  <dig> loci associated with dtf . ten of them have orthologs of arabidopsis flowering genes. glyma07g <dig> and glyma07g <dig> were located at  <dig>  kb upstream and  <dig>  kb downstream of the peak snp of dtf <dig> locus, respectively . glyma07g <dig> is homologous to atsoc <dig>  and encodes a protein sharing 77% amino acid sequence identity with the product of soybean flowering gene gmsoc <dig>  <cit> . glyma07g <dig> and the candidate gene for dtf <dig> locus glyma20g <dig> are both homologous to the arabidopsis flowering gene agamous-like  <dig>   <cit>  . the locus at about the  <dig>  mb position on gm <dig> associated with dtf was targeted by two snps in high ld . glyma09g <dig>  identified at 7 kb away from the peak snp of dtf <dig> , is homologous to arabidopsis early flowering  <dig>   <cit> .figure  <dig>

we identified the dt <dig> gene at  <dig>  kb upstream of the peak snp  on gm <dig>  which was associated with both dtm and ph . we also predicted candidate genes for other snps associated with ph. a putative gene glyma18g <dig>  encoding a membrane transport protein, was found at  <dig>  kb away from the peak snp  of locus ph <dig> on gm <dig> . it is homologous to arabidopsis auxin efflux carrier protein pin-formed  <dig> , which is involved in auxin-induced shoot and root development  <cit> . glyma19g <dig>  encoding a putative pectinesterase, was identified in a small chromosomal region associated with locus ph <dig> on gm <dig> where ld decayed rapidly . this locus alone could explain 10% of ph phenotypic variation. for dftm, seven candidate genes were proposed for seven of  <dig> significantly associated loci. the detailed information of the peak snps for all trait-associated loci and candidate genes is presented in the additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
recombination rate is one of the major factors affecting ld extension. in soybean, the recombination rate in euchromatic regions is about five times that in heterochromatic regions  <cit> . in this study, a large difference in ld decay rate was observed between these two chromosomal regions  . the low ld decay rate in euchromatic regions was also reported in a recent gwas on soybean  <cit> , in which the population had a higher diversity of origin  and more maturity groups  than the population used in this study. it is indicated that the relatively low ld decay rate might be a common phenomenon in asian soybean landraces, the major source of the usda soybean germplasm collection. therefore, ld decay rate is the primary factor limiting the mapping resolution in gwas for soybean, and a lower density of snps should be suitable for gwas in soybean as compared with other crops like maize and rice.

kinship and population structure are known as the major confounding factors leading to spurious results in association analysis, and corrected mlm containing both kinship matrix  and population structure  is more effective than the mlm containing either k or p alone  <cit> . in this study, however, no pc was involved in the mlm for the association analysis of dtf, dtm and ph, but two pcs were involved for dftm , indicating that the improvement of model fitness by involving p in the k model could vary with traits. the possible explanations might include: i) the phenotypic variation attributed to population structure varies with traits; and ii) the degree of overlap between k and p in controlling genetic relationships is different for individual traits  <cit> . therefore, the inclusion of population structure in mlm depends on the genetic relationships of the association panel and the divergence of the trait of interest.

previous reports suggested that dtm and dtf would be highly correlated  <cit> . however, a low correlation between dtf and dtm  was observed in the present study. the relatively higher correlation between dtm and dftm  indicated that dftm had greater impact on dtm than dtf. in addition, the negative correlation between dtf and dftm  indicated that for a certain early maturity group in soybean, shorter vegetative growth might imply longer reproductive growth to some extent, which may help accumulate more dry matter in seeds. the gwas results showed that the flowering locus dtf <dig> was also associated with dftm but not with dtm, while maturity loci dtm <dig> and dtm <dig> were associated with dftm but not dtf. therefore, we suppose that some flowering loci may also affect growth stage after flowering as reported in a previous study  <cit> , and some loci condition maturity through affecting reproduction period only. the loci at the  <dig>  mb position on gm <dig> for dtf  and dftm  were located within the same region but exhibited opposite effects, which may provide an underlying genetic explanation of the negative correlation between dtf and dftm.

previous research showed that major maturity loci  also affected flowering in soybean  <cit> , and e <dig> and e <dig> affected post-flowering photoperiod responses as well  <cit> . however, we did not detect these loci for any of the three traits  in the present study. one possible explanation was lack of functional polymorphism at these loci in the association panel. gwas using even all snps , including four snps in e <dig> and one in e <dig>  did not detect any of the loci at q <  <dig>  either. another explanation was that genetic variants might exist at these major loci, but could not be captured due to the lack of snp coverage. notably, some genetic variants were actually undetectable by snp genotyping. for example, the e1-nl allele, one of the natural variants of e <dig>  was a deletion of the entire gene  <cit> , which is hard to detect through snp genotyping. the different loci identified between dtf and dtm as well as dftm suggested that soybean flowering and maturity could be controlled by common major-effect loci, but also modified by numerous trait-specific minor-effect loci.

natural and artificial selections during domestication can decrease the genetic diversity and increase ld in modern soybean cultivars  <cit> , which difficults prediction of causal genes in soybean through association analysis. in this study, the estimate of genome-wide ld decay rate was much lower than that in rice  <cit> . however, rapid ld decay was found at some loci, allowing the prediction of candidate genes in these regions . for dtf, ten of the proposed gene candidates have orthologs of arabidopsis flowering genes, and seven of them were previously identified by comparative genomic analysis  <cit> . of them, glyma07g <dig> was located in close proximity to the dtf <dig> locus. it encodes a protein sharing 77% of amino acid sequence identity with the gmsoc <dig>  which promotes flowering in soybean  <cit> . the high protein sequence identity between glyma07g <dig> and gmsoc <dig> might imply their functional abundance in soybean flowering.

the snp at the  <dig>  mb position on gm <dig>  a region similar to previously reported qtls pod mat 13– <dig> and plant height 4– <dig> and 13– <dig> , was strongly associated with both dtm and ph. the dt <dig> gene was found in this region. dt <dig> is homologous to arabidopsis terminal flower  <dig>  and plays a predominant role in determining stem growth habit in soybean  <cit> . based upon the stem growth habit, soybean cultivars can be classified into two major categories, determinate and indeterminate. for the determinate soybean cultivars , sam switches from vegetative growth to reproductive growth soon after photoperiod-induced floral transition, and stem growth stops  <cit> . in contrast, the transition of sam to floral meristem is suppressed in indeterminate cultivars  and vegetative growth of sam continues until a cessation caused by the demand of developing seeds  <cit> . therefore, stem growth habit has broad effects on plant height and maturity of soybean. this is highly consistent with the result of the present study that the locus harboring dt <dig> was strongly associated with both dtm and ph, indicated that dt <dig> is very likely the causal gene for dtm <dig> and ph <dig>  because plant height is one of the major factors determining yield potential in soybean, ph <dig> with large effect on plant height may also affect soybean yield substantially. however, application of the preferred allele of ph <dig> locus needs to be careful, as it may also affect maturity dates.

the locus ph <dig>  explained 10% of phenotypic variation, was mapped to a small region on gm <dig> where ld decayed rapidly. three qtls associated with ph were previously reported in the similar region . the candidate gene glyma19g <dig> was identified near the peak snp . it was proposed to encode a pectinesterase . pectin is a structurally complex polysaccharide contained in primary cell walls of plant and has functions in plant growth, morphology and plant defense  <cit> . pectinesterase catalyzes the de-esterification of pectin into pectate and methanol, and plays important roles in some physiological processes such as stem elongation that requires rearrangement of cell wall architecture. transient stem elongation was observed in potato plants overexpressing a petunia inflate pectinesterase  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a reduction in cross-linking of cell wall pectic polysaccharide resulted in dwarf phenotype  <cit> . more recent research showed that pectinesterase regulates cell growth and hypocotyl elongation in arabidopsis by affecting the degree of pectin methyl-esterification  <cit> . therefore, glyma19g <dig> encoding a putative pectinesterase was the most likely causal gene for ph <dig>  a major-effect locus associated with plant height in soybean. notably, unlike ph <dig>  ph <dig> had no association with maturity, and selection of the desired allele of this locus might improve the yield potential of soybean without affecting the maturity dates.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci associated with dtf, dtm, dftm and ph were identified via gwas, respectively. thirty-five candidate genes were proposed, including a function-known gene  and  <dig> genes orthologous to arabidopsis genes functioning in similar traits. it evidently demonstrates the high efficiency of gwas in dissecting complex traits in soybean. a medium number of snps generated from the soysnp50k analysis is capable of capturing genome-wide allelic variation, and candidate genes are regionally accessible for crops like soybean with a low ld decay rate. the genetic variants and trait-associated snps identified in this study will be useful for soybean cultivar improvement, especially for major-effect loci associated with ph that may have great potential for soybean yield improvement. additionally, biological validation of the candidate genes will be also of great interest.
