BACKGROUND
the most common fungal disease in man is candidiasis and is caused by several opportunistic candida species. these candida species are responsible for a whole set of diseases ranging from harmless superficial skin infections to deep-seated systematic candidiasis with relatively high mortality rates. strikingly, the state of the host immune system determines the progression and severity of candidiases  <cit> . therefore, systemic infections are predominantly found in patients with a compromised immune system. the most frequent and pathogenic species is candida albicans <cit> . one important characteristic associated with its virulence is the ability to switch between different morphologies  <cit> . this morphogenetic switch includes the transition from yeast form to true hyphae, the so called yeast-to-hyphae transition.

in  <dig>  sullivan et al. described candida dubliniensis as the phylogenetically closest relative to c. albicans. however, this species differs significantly from c. albicans in its virulence, as judged by the lower carriage rate and prevalence  <cit> . clinical studies with patients from great britain as well as in vivo experiments with infected mice showed that c. dubliniensis seems to be far less successful in colonizing the human host causing systemic candidiases  <cit> . in contrast, c. albicans forms true hyphae to a greater extent under many conditions, often directly associated with higher virulence compared to c. dubliniensis <cit> .

in  <dig>  jackson et al.  <cit>  compared both species on the genomic level and could define  <dig> versus  <dig> species-specific genes for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively. however, more than 50% of the c. albicans specific genes were dubious and in silico predicted with no experimental confirmation so far. in their approach they also showed  <dig> orthologous gene pairs and a high colinearity of  <dig> % with respect to synteny. yet, these investigations were mainly based on in silico predictions deduced from the respective genomes.

with the advent of powerful deep sequencing technologies  <cit> , the transcriptional landscape of c. albicans was analyzed by rna-seq more comprehensively, showing that the transcriptome of this yeast is more complex than previously assumed  <cit> . further investigations in saccharomyces cerevisiae also revealed many noncanonical transcripts and alternative polyadenylation sites, which has not been described for yeasts before  <cit> . thus rna-seq approaches provide promising tools for annotating and quantifiying whole transcriptomes experimentally  <cit> .

in this context, we applied recent techniques in the field of rna-seq for annotating the transcriptional landscapes not only for c. dubliniensis but also for c. albicans to gain a solid and unbiased basis for the cross-species comparison regarding the genetic repertoires and their regulation. we generated two databases comprising of transcriptional units expressed under hyphal and yeast growth conditions using long read sequences from normalized and pooled cdna fragments as well as short sequence reads from not normalized cdna fragments, also used for quantification of the transcriptomes. in addition, we performed a cross-species comparison of their genetic repertoires to illustrate not only orthologous gene pairs and species-specific genes at the qualitative level but also the regulation of conserved genes at the quantitative level and thus, to define differentially expressed orthologs  between both species. accordingly, qualitative and quantitative differences identified in the transcriptional landscapes of c. albicans and c. dubliniensis might provide novel insights to explain the divergence in morphogenesis and hopefully offer a better understanding of the evolutionary adaptation of both fungi.

RESULTS
complementary deep sequencing technologies enable stringent gene annotations in c. albicans and c. dubliniensis
for an experimental annotation of the c. albicans and c. dubliniensis transcriptomes, we analyzed both fungi grown in two morphologies-blastospores and hyphae. strikingly, the induction conditions for c. dubliniensis are quite harsh to form true hyphae while hyphal growth of c. albicans can be induced under a broad range of conditions, including ypd supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum  at 37°c . under this condition, c. dubliniensis remains in the blastospore form while c. albicans forms hyphae. only in nutrient-poor environments like water supplemented with 10% fcs, c. dubliniensis grows as true hyphae. in this context, it is not yet clear why c. albicans can form hyphae while c. dubliniensis remains in the blastospore morphology under identical conditions, although both are phylogenetically so closely related. one possibility might be that the respective genetic repertoires are significantly different or that conserved genes are regulated in a different manner. to address these questions, we analyzed both transcriptomes on a qualitative as well as on a quantitative level.

for this purpose, we applied two deep sequencing technologies, the flx <dig> and the illumina technology, as complementary experimental approaches. for sequencing, total rna was isolated from blastospores and hyphae and was subsequently utilized to generate two different types of cdna libraries: one normalized library per species comprising strand-specific fragments from both growth forms for flx sequencing as well as not normalized, condition-specific cdna libraries, consisting of shorter fragments for illumina sequencing . sequencing runs and subsequent mapping of reads to the respective reference genomes are shown in additional file  <dig>  in summary, we could uniquely align  <dig> million out of  <dig> million reads for annotation purposes . to revise the in silico annotations and validate them with experimental data, we combined the normalized and strand-specific reads with the complementary, highly abundant short reads and visualized them using the genescapes genome browser . consequently, each gene was curated manually, resulting in a most stringent and high-resolution annotation of each species’ transcriptome .

following completion of the annotation in both species, we were able to analyze the expression of the respective transcriptomes. in summary, we found  <dig> expressed genes for c. albicans and  <dig> for c. dubliniensis of which  <dig> and  <dig> were coding and already annotated genes, respectively . the utr length distribution across both species was highly similar . despite the observation that the median lengths of the 5′ utrs  are slightly shorter than in the 3′ utrs , there are still more longer 5′ utrs with e. g.  <dig> genes containing utrs longer than 500 bp compared to 3′ utrs with only  <dig> genes in c. albicans . go term analyses of genes with longer 5′ utrs than 500 bp in both species, showed significant enrichments for genes involved in many regulatory processes . these data indicates a strong correlation between long utrs and regulatory function in both fungal species as already described for c. albicans and s. cerevisiae <cit> .

b data taken from orginal publications with their corresponding definitions, recalculated* or data could not be extracted .

remarkably, we could measure transcription above background for more than 90% of all annotated genes by analyzing only two different conditions. compared to data from sellam et al.  <cit>  where transcriptionally active regions  in c. albicans were detected by whole genome  microarrays out of four conditions which resulted in  <dig> active coding genes, our sequencing approach seems to be more sensitive. in good agreement, two recent reports also showed highly sensitive detection of active transcripts by deep sequencing in c. albicans, e. g. detecting  <dig> active coding genes across  <dig> conditions  <cit> .

in addition to the experimental verification and refinement of already annotated genes, we found  <dig> and  <dig> novel tars  for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively . by applying stringent criteria for the determination of coding and non-coding ntars , we assigned  <dig> and  <dig> novel bona fide open reading frames  for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively . thus, most of the novel tars are non-coding. bruno et al., sellam et al. and tuch et al. detected significant numbers of non-coding ntars in c. albicans as well. we compared those with our nc ntar datasets resulting in a core set of 69 nc ntars annotated by all working groups strongly suggesting that these genes are true positives, 259 nc ntars are consistent with at least one other group and 121 nc ntars seem to be specifically found in our approach . some of the nc ntars also belong to snornas containing c/d-boxes , as some of them were also described recently by mitrovich et al.  <cit> .

furthermore, not only for ntars but also for already annotated genes we found  <dig> novel introns in c. albicans as well as  <dig> novel introns in c. dubliniensis . most of these novel introns are located in 5′ utrs of annotated genes and in nc-ntars. among the  <dig> novel introns in c. albicans,  <dig> were also among the  <dig> novel introns described by bruno et al., indicating reliability and accuracy of our approaches. the  <dig> novel introns found by bruno et al. but not in our study have not been found as in  <dig> cases we did not see any detectable signals for splicing, in  <dig> cases the in silico predictions could be validated with our data representing no novel introns, in  <dig> cases we detected splicing signals but which are not consistent with our annotation criteria and for  <dig> intron we could not find the corresponding ntar.

as the resolution of our annotation is at single base level and each gene was individually inspected, gene borders and splice sites could be set quite accurately. strikingly, several in silico annotated orfs and their corresponding cds had to be elongated or shortened . for  <dig> intron containing genes in c. dubliniensis, the splice sites had to be adapted resulting in cds changes, while this kind of alteration was only necessary for one gene in c. albicans . in summary,  <dig> and  <dig> cds were elongated, shortened or altered in c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively.

by using strand-specific reads, we were able to determine the orientation for all ntars. among these ntars, some were overlapping with coding and annotated genes . this kind of overlapping and antisense  transcription was already described by yassour et al.  <cit>  via deep sequencing for s. cerevisiae  as well as by sellam et al. via tiling arrays for c. albicans . overall, we found  <dig> and  <dig> overlapping antisense pairs for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively. however, using our data sets, we could not analyze condition dependent expression of these transcripts nor could we assign certain go terms. the majority of these as pairs belong to a group of nc-ntars that fully or partially overlap with protein coding genes .

in addition, we could detect upstream orfs  for about  <dig>  genes per species in their 5′ utrs. an example for a conserved uorf is given in figure 1h showing cd36_ <dig>  the ortholog for ylr224w in s. cerevisiae, for which the larger uorf was already described  <cit> . these often very short orfs  in mature transcripts are thought to either enhance or repress the translation process of the downstream orfs  <cit> .

qualitative comparison of transcriptomes across both species reveals species-specific genes along with conserved genes
while the genomes of c. albicans and c. dubliniensis are largely conserved, there are distinct differences across both species like various inversions, insertion-deletions, and transposition events which might affect also pathogen-related genes as already described  <cit> . these data also revealed many orthologous gene pairs and some species-specific genes based on in silico predicted annotations in both species at that time. by using our approach, we were also interested in a cross-species comparison of experimentally verified tars as well as in quantitative differences of gene expression of the corresponding orthologs in both species. in order to compare transcript abundances across both species, we initially had to define conserved and orthologous gene pairs, and genes which might be specific for one species without a clear ortholog in the other species. for this purpose, we applied the databases comprising our experimental annotations and in silico predicted annotations, to make sure not to miss any orthologs which might not be expressed under the given conditions.

for all coding genes, we performed a reciprocal blastp search resulting in  <dig> putative orthologs excluding  transposon associated genes and pseudogenes , as well as  <dig> genes in c. albicans and  <dig> in c. dubliniensis which seem to have either no clear orthologs with reciprocal hits or even no hits at all . as some of these genes belong to gene families or have gene duplicates, in some cases it is not sufficient to rely solely on homology of sequences but also on gene synteny. for this reason, we compared our orthologous pairs and species-specific genes with those of jackson et al. for gene synteny and for gene families by individual inspection  <cit> . accordingly, we found  <dig> orthologs of which  <dig> pairs were already determined by jackson et al. and thus belong to the core set of orthologs . however,  <dig> pairs had to be manually curated out of the raw blast results based on gene family information and on gene synteny. in addition to the actual number of orthologous gene pairs between both species, we defined  <dig> novel pairs. the list of genes without clear orthologs was also revised, comprising  <dig> genes specific for c. albicans,  <dig> in agreement with jackson et al. in addition to  <dig> novel specific genes, as well as  <dig> genes in c. dubliniensis of which  <dig> were also published by jackson et al. and  <dig> novel species-specific genes . for this comparison every coding gene was taken into account , even those genes for which we did not measure significant transcriptional levels . among the  <dig> orthologs,  <dig> were not expressed in both species , indicating that  <dig> %  were transcribed under the tested conditions. however, considering the proportion of expressed genes among the species-specific genes , the number decreases to roughly 40% . the vast majority of the species-specific, non-expressed genes represent in silico predicted genes without any experimental or describing data so far. thus, to check whether those genes are not expressed under the conditions tested or they just emerged from misannotations, we analysed the degree of conservation in eight closely related fungi. indeed, it was lower for the non-expressed fraction than for the expressed fraction in c. albicans as well as in c. dubliniensis . additionally, the gene lengths of the expressed fractions seem to be visibly shorter than those of the non-expressed fractions-especially for c. albicans-specific genes .

taken together, the fraction of expressed, species-specific genes is significantly lower than the fraction of conserved genes which comprises the vast majority of all expressed genes under the conditions tested. similarly, we performed reciprocal blastn searches for ncrnas resulting in  <dig> non-coding, conserved orthologous pairs across both species .  <dig> and 331 nc-ntars seem to be specific for c.alibicans or for c. dubliniensis, respectively .

cross-species comparison for differential expression of orthologs 
using deep sequencing as an unbiased and open technology for gene expression profiling, it becomes possible to directly compare transcript abundances of e. g. conserved genes across two or more species. in this context, we were interested in the differential expression of the coding and non-coding  <dig> orthologs  in c. albicans and c. dubliniensis under one identical condition, including coding and non-coding genes. for this reason, we used transcript data from ypd supplemented with 10% fcs where c. albicans seems to follow different or additional adaptation pathways as c. dubliniensis which is reflected by their different morphologies. therefore, it seemed likely that the expression of either species-specific or conserved genes is significantly different across both species. to test this hypothesis, we performed a cross-species gene expression analyses by plotting the ratio of normalized transcript abundances in both species against total abundance as ma-plot for orthogonal expression.

strikingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> experimentally verified and tested gene pairs are similarly expressed across both species showing comparable transcript abundances. on the contrary,  <dig> gene pairs  are differentially regulated, of which  <dig> pairs are significantly up regulated in c. albicans while  <dig> show higher transcript abundances in c. dubliniensis .

assigning these genes with higher abundances in c. albicans to cellular processes or components, we found a significant enrichment of genes coding for cell surface proteins, especially from hyphal cell walls including the adhesin hwp <dig> or the immunogenic stress-associated protein ddr <dig> . a process frequently co-regulated with hyphal growth in c. albicans is iron acquisition  <cit> . in this context, eight genes involved in iron ion transport were among the group of genes being up regulated in hyphal growing c. albicans including ftr <dig>  fre <dig> or frp <dig>  an example for the divergent regulation of hyphal-associated genes in both species is represented by ece <dig>  though the function of ece <dig> is still unknown, its expression increases with hyphal cell elongation  <cit> . our comparison shows that it is expressed at highest abundance level with a strongest fold change.

for blastospore expressed genes in c. dubliniensis grown in ypd supplemented with fcs at 37°c, a significant group could be assigned to biological adhesion processes with members like ywp <dig>  als <dig> or sap <dig> . among the eight genes belonging to this go, one transcription factor was identified, aaf <dig>  which is involved in the regulation of adhesive cell surface proteins  <cit> . another cell surface protein, pga <dig>  is assigned to the go term for yeast-form cell wall composition and represents the ortholog with the highest difference in abundance among the group of genes having lower abundances in c. albicans than in c. dubliniensis.

to determine whether differential expression of these cell surface proteins and other differentially expressed orthologs either reflects species-specific adaptation in response to the environment or strictly correlates with morphology, we also analyzed the transcriptional profiles of c. albicans and c. dubliniensis during yeast to hyphae transition , respectively.

for c. albicans, we compared the transcriptomes of hyphal growing cells in ypd supplemented with 10% fcs at 37°c with those of yeast growing cells in ypd at 30°c. altogether,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated with  <dig> up regulated genes against  <dig> down regulated genes . many of the orthologs we previously found by the deo analysis with different expression rates between c. albicans and c. dubliniensis also came out to be differentially regulated during the intraspecies y-t-h in c. albicans. for instance, a significant enrichment for orthologous genes coding for hyphal cell wall proteins was detected among the up regulated genes including hwp <dig>  ddr <dig> or sod <dig> . other genes coding for iron assimilation proteins were likewise enriched . however, among those enriched groups c. albicans-specific genes has also been revealed like hyr <dig> or als <dig> coding for hyphal cell wall proteins. ece <dig> showed the highest fold change being up regulated in hyphal cells. among the  <dig> down regulated genes we failed in assigning groups to certain go terms. rather, we detected individual genes including ywp <dig> or rme <dig> 

on the other hand, in c. dubliniensis hyphal morphogenesis is almost entirely linked to the adaptation to extremely harsh conditions like water supplemented with 10% fcs at 37°c. thus, we compared the hyphal transcriptome with the yeast transcriptome in ypd supplemented with 10% fcs at 37°c also used for the cross-species comparison. we obtained  <dig> differentially regulated genes out of  <dig> while  <dig> genes were up regulated under the hyphal condition and  <dig> genes were down regulated . for validation qrt-pcr was performed for  <dig> randomly selected genes from different classes of expression levels and fold changes resulting in a significant correlation of r =  <dig>  .

among the most significant processes inhibited in water with serum is the translation machinery comprising  <dig> ribosome-associated proteins being down regulated in hyphae including the orthologs of the putative ribosomal proteins rps7a  and rps9b  . accordingly, biosynthesis processes like the aromatic amino acid synthesis represented by aro <dig>  or the glycerol biosynthesis represented by rhr <dig>  seem to be also strongly down regulated. this adaptation indicating deceleration of cell mass and cell proliferation is not surprising as the cells grow under an extreme nutrient poor condition.

however, there are many up regulated genes during hyphal growth in c. dubliniensis with significant go term enrichment in oxidation-reduction processes and in genes localized in peroxisomes . strikingly, among these genes, we detected eleven proteins involved in iron ion uptake including the orthologs of c. albicans for ftr <dig> , fre <dig>  or frp <dig> , also identified by the deo analysis between c. albicans and c. dubliniensis. additionally, one of the orthologous key repressors for iron utilization, hap <dig> , is up regulated as well. cell surface genes were detected among both sets of differentially expressed genes including the hyphally induced  as well as the hyphally repressed genes . in order to identify core subsets of morphogenesis regulated genes which are conserved across both species and regulated during hyphal growth in a similar manner, we intersected hyphally up or down regulated genes from the y-t-h analyses in c. albicans as well as in c. dubliniensis with those from the deo analysis between c. albicans and c. dubliniensis . taken together, we determined six groups with characteristic expression profiles: 1° hyphal core, 2° hyphal core, c. albicans-specific hyphal core, 1° yeast core, 2° yeast core and c. albicans-specific yeast core .

though the 1° and 2° cores share similarly up or down regulated genes in the respective species, the 2° cores show equal expression rates in the deo analysis despite of divergent morphologies under identical condition. rbt <dig> and aah <dig> are shown as representatives for the 2° hyphal core  and 2° yeast core genes  in figure 4c and d, respectively. amongst the 2° hyphal core, three genes are coding for cell surface proteins and two of these in turn play a role in heme-iron utilization-pga <dig> and rbt <dig>   <cit> . it therefore seems that both 2° gene sets are not necessarily required for hyphal or yeast morphogenesis despite the fact of being up regulated during y-t-h switches in both species.

* gene name aliases from cgd representing the corresponding orthogonal gene pairs from both species.

on the contrary, the 1° cores show clear profiles directly correlating with morphology, including the deo analysis.  <dig> genes in the 1° hyphal core containing  <dig> genes are involved in cell surface architecture, like the orthologous pairs for hwp <dig>  and ddr <dig>  five genes are involved in iron homeostasis and acquisition including ftr <dig>  fre <dig> and frp <dig> and three genes are playing a role in regulation of dna transcription, amongst others rfx <dig>  a previously described hyphal-specific target of nrg <dig> <cit>  .

in addition, a smaller group of  <dig> genes was detected which seems to be hyphally repressed comprising the 1° yeast core subset of genes including three cell surface genes als <dig>  ywp <dig> and pir <dig>  which were already described to be specific for yeast growing cells  <cit> . strikingly, three transcription factors belong to this group as well—two known negative regulators   <cit>  and one yet uncharacterized gene  in c. albicans but known to be a meiotic regulator in s. cerevisiae   <cit> .

however, there are also differences in the regulation of cell surface genes and of transcriptional regulators during hyphal growth between both species as well. within the c. albicans-specific hyphal core set of genes, we could determine five cell surface genes specifically expressed in c. albicans under the hyphal-growing condition in ypd with serum, including ece <dig> , the most abundant gene expressed in hyphae next to hwp <dig>  in contrast, under hyphal-growing condition in c. dubliniensis, there was almost no transcription detected for the respective ortholog . beside these cell surface genes, four transcriptional regulators were found to be specifically up regulated in hyphal-growing c. albicans, e. g. ume <dig> and sfl <dig> which are known to be divergently regulated across both species  <cit> . in summary, we found  <dig> genes with an expression pattern comparable to ece <dig> or ume <dig>  representing differentially regulated orthologs with respect to morphogenetic adaptation. vice versa, another  <dig> genes were classified as c. albicans-specific yeast core genes showing a profile like rhd <dig> , a putative mannosyl-transferase which is repressed during hyphal development in c. albicans <cit>  but obviously not in c. dubliniensis.

taken together, these molecular insights provide evidence, that in addition to a core set of hyphally regulated genes, also species-specific sets of hyphally induced or repressed factors exist for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, indicating that hyphae in both species are equipped in a different manner to adapt specifically to the respective environments.

discussion
next-generation dna sequencing technologies including rna-seq provide unbiased approaches for the analyses of gene expression profiles. in contrast to dna-microarrays where prior information about genomic annotations is essential, rna-seq conceptually is unbiased. furthermore, the determination of quantitative data using rna-seq is accomplished by counting individual transcripts rather than by deducing transcript abundances from signal intensities following hybridization to specific probes in microarrays. this concept with its open and unbiased architecture allows not only for experimental  annotations of whole transcriptomes but also provides the opportunity to analyze gene expression profiles across closely related species by directly comparing the normalized abundances determined as rpkm values of previously defined orthologs.

the combination of two complementary sequencing technologies  for the experimental annotations in c. albicans and c. dubliniensis in our study resulted in a highly stringent definition of experimentally verified  as well as novel tars. in this context, the rate of determining false positive tars was minimized in terms of considering only tars represented by reads above threshold and provided by both sequencing technologies. bias intrinsic to one or the other technology thus was largely reduced. approaches from other groups for the experimental annotation of transcriptional landscapes in c. albicans revealed far more novel tars than we found, ranging from  <dig>  ntars using tiling arrays up to  <dig>  ntars using abi solid sequencing  <cit> . in contrast, bruno et al. reported 602 ntars generated using illumina sequencing that more closely resembles the number we found with 475 ntars. this might be due to the fact that we also used illumina and by combination with flx sequencing as well as applying stringent criteria for annotation thus resulted in the least number of ntars. in fact, we also defined a core subset of 69 nc ntars detected by four independent working groups and four independent technologies strongly arguing for the increasing importance of novel tars, especially of non-coding ntars. nevertheless, we are sure that our study lacks a significant number of ntars as our approach was optimized for higher specificity to reduce the number of false positives opposed to higher sensitivity that would result in a minimal number of false negatives.

furthermore, it is obvious that the analysis of only a limited set of conditions cannot reveal the complete picture. however, based on the fact that using our approach we could detect 95% of already in silico annotated genes one might assume that we possibly missed about 5-10% of novel tars. for c. dubliniensis, there have only been a few studies about global gene expression profiles since genomic sequence is available only previously  <cit> . in this context, our annotation might also lack for undetected genes in c. dubliniensis that are not expressed under the conditions tested.

in both species, we defined  <dig> novel protein coding genes of which  <dig> correspond to c. dubliniensis. most of these genes contain smaller orfs and were found to have orthologs in c. albicans which have been just recently added to the genome based on comparative genomic studies of eight candida species by butler and colleagues  <cit> . however, this study did not include the genome of c. dubliniensis explaining the higher number of novel coding genes in c. dubliniensis and the lower number of  <dig> novel coding genes in c. albicans.

an additional advantage of using experimental data generated by rna-seq is evident by the annotation of tars at single nucleotide resolution. in both species many cds had to be altered in terms of elongating and shortening them or containing amino acid exchanges due to incorrect predicted splice sites . in some cases, elongations at the n-termini of proteins may contain additional functional domains which were missing recently reflecting the importance of experimental validation of in silico predictions.

however, the largest amount of novel genes belongs to the class of non-coding tars comprising some snornas and a significant number of antisense transcripts. whether this observation provides a biological mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation like repression of translation or rna-turnover remains to be analyzed. a recent study in schizosaccharomyces pombe has shown that antisense rnas are associated with several meiotically induced genes by repression of basal expression of the genes. and it has also been shown that the rnai machinery is not necessary for this repression  <cit> . however, if such a mechanism is conserved in fungal species, it should represent a more general principle not restricted to the regulation of meiotic genes as many fungi including c. albicans and c. dubliniensis are lacking a meiotic cycle.

there is another transcript feature in post-transcriptional regulation which has been well known for s. cerevisiae for almost thirty years, the so called upstream orfs in 5′ utrs  <cit> . for each of the analyzed species, we found about  <dig>  putative uorf containing genes with at least one uorf. this observation implies that the expression of many genes is far more complex than previously thought.

qualitative comparisons between c. albicans and c. dubliniensis have already been performed in a previous study at the in silico prediction level revealing many coding orthologs  as well as coding species-specific genes in both species- <dig> in c. albicans and  <dig> in c. dubliniensis, respectively  <cit> . while this study is exclusively based on the predicted gene annotation at that time, our experimental data is in good agreement to these results but further increases the number of respective genes assigned to the different categories. the majority of orthologs  in both species is largely overlapping between our results and those from jackson et al. and therefore might be considered as reliable. nevertheless, with the addition of newly identified genes to the respective genetic repertoires and by inspections of gene syntenies on single gene level, we could further increase the number of orthologous gene pairs to 5802-including non-coding ntars even up to  <dig>  in addition, our approach revealed about two times more species-specific coding genes in each species- <dig> and  <dig> in c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively. however, only 40% of all species-specific genes were expressed above threshold levels, as only  <dig> out of  <dig> species-specific genes reported by jackson and colleagues are expressed under the hyphae inducing condition we tested in c. albicans, for example. in contrast to the expression rate of 96% above threshold for those genes with clear orthologs in both species, this might implicate that although c. albicans and c. dubliniensis are equipped with unique sets of species-specific genes, they might not express them to that extent as revealed for orthologous genes. the reason for that might be, that they are simply not expressed under the tested conditions or that they represent in silico misannotations. at least, the lower degree of conservation of the non-expressed genes supports the latter. remarkably, there is also a significantly high number of species-specific non-coding ntars is for both species . however, not much is known about the function of non-coding tars in candida spp. and thus has to be investigated in ongoing studies.

while many potential novel targets have been revealed by the qualitative comparison of gene repertoires, we also focused on quantitative differences in the regulation of the orthologs comprising more than 90% all genes. in fact, the concept of rna-seq allows for the analyses of quantitative gene expression profiles across two different species. this study is the first to show the possibilities of differential expression of orthologs  by rna-seq and demonstrates a promising approach for unbiased comparisons across two species at very high resolution. a recent approach for comparative transcript profiling was described by o’connor and colleagues based on c. dubliniensis-specific microarrays  <cit> . in contrast to o’connor’s approach where hyphal-specific genes were determined by comparison of fold change ratios derived from microarray data of different labs, the main difference of our approach lies in the additional information revealed by the comparison of transcript abundances between different species under identical conditions rather than to exclusively utilize fold changes between different conditions and species. our direct comparison of normalized abundances of all orthologous gene pairs revealed about  <dig> genes with significantly different abundance levels under one identical condition . thus, the adaptation of both species and the induction of e. g. hyphal growing c. albicans not only seemed to be dependent on the species-specific genetic repertoires but also on the divergent regulation of orthologous genes. processes like iron uptake and utilization and hyphal cell wall composition are among the most significant differences between those species under the identical condition which directly correlates to their morphologies. strikingly, iron uptake in turn is supposed to be tightly associated with hyphal induction and virulence as well as for persistence within the microbiome of the host  <cit> . though we found many iron-responsive genes with higher transcription levels in c. albicans, we were not able to detect significant differences in the levels of the recently revealed, central regulators of the iron homeostasis circuit  <cit> . indeed, there is no reason for the cells to induce their iron uptake machinery as the medium represents an iron repleted condition. therefore, the central transcription factors  share similar expression rates in both species as expected, but still the data in c. albicans show higher rates of downstream targets of these regulators for iron uptake including ftr <dig>  frp <dig> and cfl <dig>  this observation might indicate a more complex transcription network for an adapted need of hyphal growing c. albicans cells which is independant from iron availability and obviously not activated in yeast growing c. dubliniensis cells under identical conditions. this means in particular that the diverged regulation of iron-related genes seems to be strictly linked to morphogenesis in c. albicans. the intraspecies y-t-h switch analysis in c. albicans confirmed this hypothesis with both sets of genes being up regulated-genes for iron ion uptake and genes already described to be specific for hyphal development. remarkably, there is only a limited number of hyphae inducing conditions for c. dubliniensis like water supplemented with serum, that in most cases lack nutrients including iron  <cit> . as revealed by our gene expression analysis of hyphal growing c. dubliniensis under this condition, genes involved in iron uptake also show high expression levels. in this case, the transcription factor hap <dig> and its targets  are up regulated. thus, iron metabolism seems to be strictly linked to hyphal morphogenesis in both species in a conserved manner.

moreover, a whole set of  <dig> genes with similar expression profiles could be defined  containing  <dig> cell surface/secreted proteins  and three transcriptional regulators , for example. in another set of  <dig> genes which are exclusively expressed in hyphal growing c. albicans , we found another five cell surface/secreted proteins and four transcription factors. in fact, this group represents a significant c. albicans-specific fingerprint of genes which neither are regulated in a conserved manner nor are they linked to hyphal morphogenesis in c. dubliniensis. especially the cell surface/secreted protein ece <dig> is one of the most abundant genes expressed correlating with hyphal extension. in contrast, another recent study reported transcript profiling data from many induction cultures in c. dubliniensis, including water with serum showing that ece <dig> and also ume <dig>  one of the four detected transcription factors within this group, are up regulated during hyphal morphogenesis  <cit> . however, this difference might be due to the fact that different strains with different filamentation properties were used as we worked with c. dubliniensis strain cd <dig>  while they worked with wü <dig>  from this it becomes clear that there are even significant strain-specific regulations within one species like shown for ece <dig> or ume <dig> in these two strains and it might be reasonable to study different strains per species. among the four transcription factors exclusively induced in hyphal growing c. albicans, there is also sfl <dig> which has been described in accordance to our data not to be up regulated during rhe infection with c. dubliniensis strain cd <dig>  but obviously essential for hyphal formation in c. albicans <cit> . in addition, we found two promising novel transcriptional regulators which have not been described yet associated with divergently regulated genes across both species-set <dig>  coding for a histone deacetylase and suggested to regulate white-opaque switching and morphogenesis  <cit>  and zcf <dig>  coding for a zinc-cluster protein possibly regulating adherence factors  <cit> . both regulators might serve as starting points for further studies of c. albicans specific adaptation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, this study for the first time reports the comparative experimental annotation of transcriptional landscapes of the two most closely related fungi c. albicans and c. dubliniensis. similarities as well as differences in the respective genetic repertoires and in the expression of orthologs and species-specific genes indicate that adaptation and virulence of both fungi are at least regulated at the transcriptional level. in this context, this study might contribute towards a better understanding of how regulatory networks in both species divergently adopted during evolution.
