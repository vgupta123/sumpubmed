BACKGROUND
laterally transferred genes play an important role in the adaptation of bacterial pathogens . most genetic changes arising from lgt, especially insertion of sges, will be deleterious or neutral  <cit> . however, laterally transferred pathogenicity islands in e. coli and other pathogens show that large groups of laterally transferred genes can fix in bacterial populations . similarly, sges can proliferate to the extent that they comprise a significant proportion of the genomes of some bacteria. sge’s and lgt genes can contain codons that are rarely found in the host genome. as such, it is of interest to investigate the indirect effects of introducing large numbers of these genes upon genome level traits such as codon usage and the global trna pool.

the elevated expression of a gene with low cai  codons can have a strong impact on growth rate . translation is the most energetically demanding of cellular processes, and the presence of many genes with poorly adapted codons could lead to strong selection for better adapting the genes to translation in the host. indeed, lgt seems to occur most readily between genomes that use similar codons  <cit> . the favored model by which a gene becomes better adapted to its host genome is by the stepwise fixation of substitutions that change rarely used codons into preferred codons  <cit> . this is supported by between species comparisons that find that the degree of codon adaptation increases for individual genes or operons that have higher expression  <cit> .

however, there are reasons why this process maybe less effective for larger volumes of dna. first, because the number of sites that requires replacement could be very large, the step-wise replacement of individual sites would take a prohibitively long time. second, the selective advantage conferred by the conversion of a single codon site will be very small and thus the path to fixation would be sinuous and prolonged.

an alternative solution is that, instead of changing the codon content of many genes, the trna gene content of the cell can change  <cit> . there are good reasons why this might be plausible. the duplication of a trna gene is a relatively common mutational event  <cit> , and would simultaneously effect all genes containing the non-optimal codons corresponding to that trna gene. moreover, increasing the copy number of a trna gene has been demonstrated to increase the amount of the trna in the cell  <cit> , a correlation partially due to trna being a direct product of transcription. in support of this hypothesis, tuller and co-workers found that genes that were more recently introduced into the genome via lgt contained codons that were less well suited to the genomes set of trna genes <cit> , indicating the presence of selective pressure to change the trna content of the cell. this was further supported by the calculation of an “optimal” set of trna genes for a given set of genes: the authors found that the genome wide set of genes had a better fit that the set of recently introduced genes  <cit> .

the vast repository of bacterial genome sequences provides a superb resource for addressing questions of genome evolution. a popular approach is to search for trends by analyzing a representative sample of all sequenced bacterial species. however, these sets of species can span a greater evolutionary distance than all of eukarya, and such large divergence times can obscure patterns of interest. as an alternative, we look at a model set of strains within the e. coli/shigella complex  <cit> , ideal because of the high quality of its sequenced genomes and the extensive knowledge of their genetics . the range of divergence for these strains is  <dig> – <dig>  %, allowing us a “shutter speed” sufficient to capture events that can elude studies focusing on between-species comparisons. here we exploit this model system to investigate the genome level response to influxes of foreign dna.

shigella strains have been known to acquire large numbers of sges  <cit> , and the pathogenic o157:h <dig> strains of e. coli, have sustained the introduction of many genes by lgt  <cit> . we find evidence that suggests that pathogenic strains of e. coli have adapted to changes in codon use by increasing the copy number of key trna genes. our results suggest that this is achieved by the selective retention of trna genes introduced by phage mediated lgt.

RESULTS
trna genes are over-represented in shigella and o157:h <dig> genomes, but not other e. coli strains
we scanned e. coli genomes  for the copy number of all trna genes for each of the  <dig> anticodons . many trna genes showed copy number variation, typically plus or minus one copy compared to other strains . two subgroups, o157:h <dig>  and s. flexneri  had at least a 2-fold enrichment for select trna genes, compared to the non-shigella or o157:h <dig> e. coli strains. for o157:h <dig> these were trna genes corresponding to aga-arg, and for shigella, gga-gly, aca-thr and aga-arg  . the most striking example from the above analysis is the multiple copies of a trnaaga gene, which in the type strain mg <dig> is encoded by a single copy of argu, while o157:h <dig> sakai has eight trnaaga genes.table  <dig> strains used in this study

over expression of argu has been shown to facilitate expression of genes containing its rare anticodon aga  <cit> , and a deficiency of argu can lead to frame shifts in such genes  <cit> . these experimental studies suggest that selective pressure on genomes to maintain sufficient levels of trna anticodons could be substantial. we next sought to see if this change in the trna gene complement of the cell was reflected in the dna content changes detected in these strains in the gene copy number analysis.

systematic analysis of repeat elements across e. coli reveals the enrichment of sges in shigella
we found that the genes the comprise the insertion sequences is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> were the most prolific sges in e. coli genomes . selfish elements are more numerous in the shigella strains, compared to non-shigella e. coli , with each shigella strain having on average  <dig> more transposase, integrase or transposon repressor genes than non-shigella e. coli strains .table  <dig> the average number of selfish genetic elements in shigella strains


e. coli


the sge component of shigella genomes, about  <dig> genes, makes up a significant proportion of the genome. despite the swelling of the genome due to sge proliferation, the genome sizes of shigella  has not increased relative to phylogetically close e. coli strains, thus sge comprise approximately one tenth of the genome by gene number. because these shigella strains are phylogenetically dispersed across e. coli, it is unlikely that the apparent enrichment of sge elements in shigella strains is due to non-shigella strains having experienced a systematic decrease in sge insertions. the fixation of is elements in shigella could be beneficial, but is quite possibly deleterious or neutral and occurs due to genetic drift  <cit> . whether a new is element insertion is beneficial or deleterious, once it is fixed in the population and expressed, the cell will be under selective pressure to mitigate any deleterious effects of it’s insertion, or the insertion of multiple is elements.

shigella selfish elements display differential codon usage that corresponds to the enriched trna genes
we analyzed the codon usage of the shigella sge genes, and then calculated the fold enrichment of each codon compared to the genome wide average, and did this for each shigella genome . using a cut-off of 2-fold enrichment we found that codons corresponding to aga-arg, aca-thr and gga-gly, the most enriched trna genes, were also enriched in the selfish elements compared to a matched set of genes randomly chosen from the e. coli genome . however, we found another codon  that is frequently used in the coding sequence of shigella sges  while the trnaata gene was not found in multiple copies in any genome. this could be that the trnaata gene had increased its expression by means other than gene duplication, or even that genes containing high levels of ata codons do not suffer a detrimental effect on expression. even allowing for the ata-ile codon, that three of the four most enriched codons corresponded to the three trna genes with the highest copy number is significant .

we counted the absolute numbers of codons, finding that on average  <dig>  aga-arg,  <dig>  gga and  <dig>  aca-thr codons are introduced into shigella genomes by sge proliferation. these results, together with previous experiments demonstrating the cost of expressing genes requiring rare trnas suggest that it is plausible that the proliferation of trnaaga, trnagga and trnaaga genes maybe a selective response to the stress applied by the massive shift in codon usage demanded by the gain of  <dig> genes, using codons rarely used by the host genome.

lgt genes are enriched with aga codons in proportion to the copy number of the trnaaga gene “argo” in o157:h7
if the increase in trna gene number is a selective response to increased codon use, then the numbers of trna genes and codon use should be correlated. the o157:h <dig> lineage is known to have sustained many lgt events during its history  <cit> , and does not have an unusual enrichment of selfish elements, so we started by examining the lgt content and codon use of an expanded set of o157:h <dig> strains . we used a blast-based phylogenetic method  to create a list of lgt genes that are specific to the o157:h <dig> clade and not other e. coli strains. we then determined which of the total set of o157:h <dig> lgt genes were specific to each clade within the o157:h <dig> phylogeny at the point at which that clade diverged from the common ancestor shared with sakai . we compared the codon use of these subsets of laterally transferred genes to the number of argo copies . for all o157:h <dig> strains, the most duplicated trna gene corresponded to the most enriched codon  in laterally transferred dna. we found that there was a strong correlation between codon usage and trna gene copy number in all o157:h <dig> strains .fig.  <dig> the enrichment of o157:h <dig> strains correlates with the trnaaga gene copy number. a. a phylogeny of sequenced o157:h <dig> strains . numbers above the red arrow indicate where putative lgt genes are binned as occurring before the divergence of the node indicated. the column to the right shows the number of trnaaga genes that can be found in each genome. b. the number of trnaaga genes is plotted against the proportion of all arginine sites encoded by aga in the lgt originating genes. the exact numbers used for plotting this figure can be found in table  <dig>  the genes corresponding to nodes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are provided in supplementary data



the additional copies of trna genes are introduced by lgt and not by within-genome duplication
there are two plausible models of trna gene copy number increase. the first is that genes are duplicated within the genome during dna replication or recombination mediated repair. this will result in two identical copies of the gene, and usually a surrounding syntenic region of dna. alternatively, additional copies of genes can be reintroduced by lgt. in this case additional copies are less likely to be identical, and maybe flanked by phage-associated genes, since phage mediates many lgt events. we thus sought to compare these two models of gene copy acquisition.

lgt is highly frequent in bacterial genomes  <cit> . if the probability that one individual will contribute dna via lgt to another is influenced by proximity, it seems likely that most lgt events must originate in the same species or genus. moreover, lgt is hypothesized to often occur during phage infection  <cit> . since phage has restrictions on the range of hosts that they can infect, it seems likely that new genes that are introduced via lgt could be identical to genes already present in the host. in such cases it would be very difficult, or perhaps impossible to distinguish between lgt events and within-genome duplication events by a post hoc analysis. nonetheless, in some cases it should be possible to distinguish between these two hypotheses.

the mechanisms of within-genome gene duplication often result in the formation of tandem arrays of identical duplicate copies. this can be observed for some sets of trna genes that are present in high copy numbers. for example the glyv, glyw, glyx and glyy trna genes are present in a tandem array of three or four identical copies in all e. coli. we found that a tandem arrangement was not evident for any of the trna genes that we have described as enriched in shigella or o157:h <dig> strains . interestingly, in shigella the glyt, argo and thru genes, all of which were present in high copy numbers in shigella, were found together in multiple instances. each of these copies, except for the original, were flanked by phage sequences suggesting that these genes were introduced by phage mediated lgt. it is plausible that there was a single phage mediated integration event and then this was duplicated by within-genome duplication events. however, recently duplicated genes should show a high degree of sequence identity and while the sequence of glyt showed perfect sequence identity across all copies, argo and thru showed a relatively large degree of sequence variation, suggesting that duplicate copies had time to diverge .fig.  <dig> multicopy trnaaga genes of shigella and o157:h <dig> and their genomic context. a. the glyt and thru genes of s. flexneri 2a 2547t often occur together, however the dna sequence immediately flanking the insertion site of additional copies are flanked by phage , rather than bacterial genes . closest flanking genes were determined by genome specific blast search. percentages indicate degree of sequence identity to the gene designated as the original host copy b. the trnaaga genes argu and argo of o157:h <dig> sakai. percentages indicate the sequence identity to the gene annotated as argo <dig> in the o157:h <dig> sakai genome. c and d, the positions of trna gene insertions across the genome for shigella flexneri 2a 2475 t and o157:h <dig> sakai. precise numbers and sites of insertion vary for other members of the o157:h <dig> and shigella subgroups



the o157:h <dig> cluster of strains contain between  <dig> and  <dig> copies of trnaaga genes. each o157:h <dig> strain has a single copy of argu, as do all e. coli genomes, with all additional trnaaga genes being argo, a phage originating trna gene with only 75 % sequence identity with argu . it is possible that, although this gene is phage in origin, after its initial introduction via lgt that gene duplication contributed to the proliferation of this gene. however, the lack of tandem arrays of this gene and the association of each insert with flanking phage genes suggest that each copy originated from outside the genome. two pairs of argo genes, argo4/argo <dig> and argo6/argo <dig> appear to be the result of duplication events due to the synteny of the surrounding genes. however, argo <dig> and argo <dig> have only  <dig>  % sequence identity. the only two identical copies of argo, argo <dig> and argo <dig>  are the most promising candidates for within-genome duplication. while it is possible that one or two of the seven argo copies are due to a within-genome duplication event, it seems that the retention of genes introduced by lgt plays a more important role in increasing gene copy number for trna genes both in shigella and o157:h <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the picture of trna gene copy number and codon use evolution has become more sophisticated over decades of study. early workers concluded that codon usage is constrained by the trna genes present in the genome  <cit> , while others have posited theoretical models concluding that trna copy number and codon usage could coevolve . the work presented here tentatively supports that the set of trna genes can change in response to drastic changes in codon use. is the change in trna number a long-term evolutionary solution to changes in genome composition of shigella and o157:h7? other work has shown that trna usage is under constraints enforced by gc mutational biases and missense errors inherent to certain trna-codon pairs  <cit> . if this is indeed the case, then the increase in trna gene copy number observed here may only be a single step in a cascade of possible evolutionary steps initiated by lgt .fig.  <dig> a step-wise model of compensatory adaptation to lgt.  <dig>  lgt dna  inserts into the genome and causes an increase in fitness, fixing in the population.  <dig>  expression of the gene is hampered by non-optimal codon use. in order to increase the expression of the lgt gene, lgt dna is duplicated   <cit> , causing an increase in fitness. this comes at the cost of the inefficient use of the translational machinery, here shown by increased use of ribosomes.  <dig>  trna genes  are duplicated, resulting in more efficient translation of the lgt genes, and reduced demand upon the translational machinery.  <dig>  the lgt genes become integrated, adjusting codon use by way of mutational pressure and selection for lower translation error and missense mutation rates  <cit> . purple indicates integrated host dna
