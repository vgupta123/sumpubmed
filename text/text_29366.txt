BACKGROUND
the enzyme inositol monophosphatase  has attracted considerable scrutiny since the early 1980s. then, it was discovered that low millimolar concentrations of li+ inhibit impase-catalysed dephosphorylation of myo-inositol-1-phosphate  <cit> , which could plausibly explain the marked decrease of myo-inositol in brain tissue following administration of lithium, a veteran therapeutic in manic depression treatment  <cit> . inhibition of myo-inositol synthesis affects the phosphatidyl inositol second messenger pathway, which is linked to manic depression, and it is now widely accepted, though unproven, that impases constitute a major target of lithium therapy  <cit> .

the mycobacterial cell wall contains several lipid constituents based on the structure of phosphatidylinositol , such as free pi, phosphatidylinositol-mannosides, lipomannan, and lipoarabinomannan  <cit> . in addition to their critical structural role, these lipids are significant as immunomodulatory factors in interactions of the tubercle bacillus with the host  <cit> . pi, an essential structural component, is synthesised by phosphatidylinositol synthase, m. tuberculosis pgsa, from cdp-diacylglycerol and myo-inositol  <cit> . in mycobacteria, the supply of myo-inositol to pi synthesis is thought to be maintained by de novo synthesis, which entails conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to inositol-1-phosphate, catalysed by inositol-1-phosphate synthase, and subsequent dephosphorylation of inositol-1-phosphate catalysed by an impase  <cit> . thus, impase activity is a critical part of pi biosynthesis in mycobacteria. indeed, growth of mycobacterium smegmatis is accompanied by impase activity that dies off as growth reaches the stationary phase, while growth is retarded in the presence of lithium  <cit> .

the m. tuberculosis genome encodes four impase-like genes   <cit> , but little is known about the function of the corresponding proteins in terms of m. tuberculosis biology. the enzyme most closely related to human impase , m. tuberculosis suhb , has been annotated as a 'putative extragenic suppressor protein' according to its homology to e. coli suhb. the e. coli enzyme has been implicated in posttranscriptional control of gene expression  <cit> , but no such function has to date been described for m. tuberculosis suhb. according to the transposon mutagenesis study by sassetti et al., rv <dig> is essential, suhb is dispensable  <cit> , and information on essentiality is as yet unavailable for cysq and impa. in vitro analyses showed that m. tuberculosis cysq hydrolyses inositol-1-phosphate, adenosine-monophosphate and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate  <cit> . in contrast, suhb appears to be a bona fide impase with little or no activity towards fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate. still, suhb also de-phosphorylates a series of polyol phosphates including glucitol-6-phosphate, glycerol-2-phosphate, and 2'-amp, albeit with significantly reduced efficacy  <cit> . like the human orthologue, suhb is activated by mg2+, and inhibited by lithium. nevertheless, suhb requires higher concentrations of mg2+ for full activation , and activity persists over a much wider concentration range  of the activating ion before it becomes inhibitory  <cit> . in order to better understand potential functional differences between the mycobacterial and eukaryotic impases, we have determined the crystal structure of m. tuberculosis suhb and characterised its self-assembly state in solution.

RESULTS
structure determination of suhb
the structure of m. tuberculosis suhb was determined by molecular replacement to a resolution of  <dig>  Å . the asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice contains three independent copies of the suhb monomer forming two crystallographically distinct dimers: chains a and c associate as one dimer, whereas chain b forms an analogous dimer with one of its symmetry mates. the quality of the refined model is limited by several factors: first, a high wilson b-factor  of the measured structure factor amplitudes is mirrored by a high average atomic displacement factor  ; second, three disordered loop regions  and mild disorder at either terminus leave  <dig> of  <dig> residues of the primary sequence unaccounted for ; third, despite a nominal resolution of  <dig>  Å and reasonably strong data in the high-resolution shell , structural details are less well defined by the  density than expected at this resolution. in order to counteract an unfavourable observables-to-parameter ratio, non-crystallographic symmetry  restraints were employed, leading to root mean square  deviations between ncs-related molecules of  <dig>  Å for backbone and ≤  <dig>  Å for side chain atoms. based on visual impression and real space r-factor, the electron density is best defined for subunits a and c, and worst for subunit b.

apart from minor discrepancies, the suhb monomer is identical in fold to eukaryotic impases  <cit> , with rms deviations between cα positions of superimposed backbone structures ranging from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å . in order to more readily compare suhb with related structures we denote secondary structure according to the recent report of the  <dig>  Å-resolution structure of bovine impase   <cit> . the impase fold is characterised by alternating layers of α-helices and β-sheets in an α-β-α-β-α sandwich arrangement . comparative studies established that impases share a structural scaffold with inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatases , fructose- <dig> -biphosphatases , 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatases  and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatase/inositol- <dig> -bisphophatases  , although on the amino acid sequence level the evolutionary relationship between these groups of enzymes is not obvious  <cit> . however, members of this super-family differ notably with respect to their assembly state: eukaryotic ippases, papases and pipases are monomeric  <cit> , eukaryotic impases form homodimers as do a subset of dual activity impase/fbpases  <cit> , whereas fbpases and the dual activity impase/fbpase of thermotoga maritima form tetrameric assemblies  <cit> .

eukaryotic adenosine-monophosphate -regulated fbpases have been described in terms of two sub-domains. in this description, layers i and ii of the α-β-α-β-α sandwich are equivalent to the amp-binding sub-domain of porcine fbpase, and layers iii to v correspond to the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate binding sub-domain   <cit> . the primary sequence runs sequentially through layers i and ii of the 'amp-binding' sub-domain, but meanders in the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate-binding sub-domain between layers iii-v, with helices and strands alternating. this pattern is interrupted only for strands β <dig> and β <dig>  which are not separated by a helix . the dimer observed in the crystal structure of suhb is primarily mediated by helices α <dig> in layer v and the β-sheet in layer iv, which extends across the interface . in contrast, strands in the sheet of layer ii are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the dimer interface.

due to the absence of divalent metal ions and of substrate in the active site, the loop connecting helices α <dig> and α <dig> is disordered , as is much of the loop connecting strands β <dig> and β <dig> . both features are consistent with the structure of the apo form of human impase . soaks of suhb crystals in mg2+- or mn2+-containing cryoprotection buffers failed to induce ordering, or give rise to density peaks associated with metals sites known from the eukaryotic orthologues, which we attribute to the acidic ph  of the crystallisation buffer. further disorder was seen in the hairpin loop connecting strands β <dig> and β <dig>  in layer iv, while density for the β9-α <dig> loop was disjointed, yet indicating that the conformation of the loop between residues  <dig> and  <dig> differed markedly between subunits. as a consequence, side chains for residues tyr <dig>  val <dig>  arg <dig> and cys <dig> in this loop could not be built.

active site
the active site of suhb is situated in a cavity carved out at the n-terminal end of helix α <dig>  sandwiched between layers ii and iv . due to the disordered α1-α <dig> loop – referred to as the 'mobile loop'  <cit>  – the active site in suhb appears wide open to solvent. yet, it is anticipated that the α1-α <dig> loop will become ordered upon the enzyme binding metal ions and substrate. in this state the active site is anticipated to be effectively shielded from solvent, as is the case in the ligand-bound structure of human impase  <cit> . in suhb, the α1-α <dig> loop has a 10-residue insertion relative to human impase . hence, the exact conformation of this loop in the ordered state may well deviate from that of the human enzyme. interestingly, alternative secondary structure conformations of this loop were observed within the tetramer of the structure of thermotoga maritima impase/fbpase tm <dig>  while the mobile loop included a short helix in two subunits of the tetramer, it assumed a β-hairpin conformation in the other two subunits  <cit> . the mobile loop includes a lysine residue at position  <dig>  that stabilizes the third of three catalytic metal sites through hydrogen bonds to two ordered water molecules. in suhb, this lysine is conserved and parallels in the characteristics of li+ inhibition between suhb and human impase  suggest an equivalent pattern of interactions in the mycobacterial enzyme.

structural elements of the active site required for metal and substrate binding include the impase signature motif 104dpxdgt <dig>  between strand β <dig> and helix α <dig>  the 82geeg <dig> motif at the 'tip' of the β3-β <dig> loop, the 209g aa <dig> motif in the β10-α <dig> loop, in addition to glu <dig> in β <dig> and the 234wdxa <dig> motif in helix α <dig>  all elements contributing to metal site coordination are contained within one subunit of the dimeric assembly. compelling evidence for three sites occupied by mg2+ was provided only recently by the  <dig>  Å-structure of bovine impase  <cit> . this study, in conjunction with preceding structural studies on lithium-sensitive papase and lithium-insensitive impase/fbpases  <cit> , provided strong support for a 3-metal catalytic reaction mechanism. when mapped onto the structure of suhb, these three magnesium ion sites are coordinated by glu <dig> , asp <dig> , asp <dig> , asp <dig> , in addition to the carbonyl of ile <dig> . in a previous study we had shown that mutations to these sites in suhb reduced activity dramatically  <cit> . likewise, when activity was tested in the presence of various divalent cations, mg2+ was the most potent activator of suhb. these data and the high level of sequence conservation among active site residues justify the attempt to construct a model of inositol-1-phosphate in the active site of suhb  and to analyse potential differences in substrate-enzyme contacts.

in our model of the suhb-substrate complex, the phosphate moiety is positioned at the n-terminal end of helix α <dig>  the helix dipole countering the charge of the phosphate . most contacts between enzyme and phosphate are through the three mg2+ ions, with contact distances in the order of  <dig> – <dig>  Å, in agreement with the experimental structures of the eukaryotic impases  <cit> . in addition, the phosphate forms h-bond interactions with the amide nitrogen of gly <dig>  and thr <dig>  at the n-terminus of helix α <dig>  the inositol moiety packs primarily against residues in the β9-α <dig> and β10-α <dig> loops with specificity-determining contacts provided by glu <dig>  in strand β <dig>  and asp <dig>  in the β4-α <dig> loop . all conserved side chains forming the metal binding sites or contacting inositol-1-phosphate are seen in essentially the same conformation as in the human/bovine enzyme, with the exception of glu83: as a consequence of disorder in a large part of the β3-β <dig> loop, glu <dig>  in subunit a points outward rather into the active site .

significant discrepancies between the m. tuberculosis and the human enzyme are seen in the β9-α <dig> loop, which in human impase provides a contact surface, but no specificity-determining interactions with the inositol ring  <cit>  . the β9-α <dig> loop in suhb is two residues shorter than in the human enzyme with weak sequence conservation . although poorly ordered between residues 183– <dig>  residues in proximity to the putative position of the inositol ring – gly <dig>  phe <dig> and gly <dig> – are well defined by density . interestingly, the carbonyl oxygen of phe <dig> falls within h-bonding distance range of the c <dig>  and c <dig>  hydroxyls of the inositol ring, suggesting that the β9-α <dig> of suhb may form specificity-determining contacts to the substrate that are not present in the human enzyme.

a surprising observation was a patch of unexplained density in the active site that overlaps significantly with the modelled position of inositol-1-phosphate, while a second density peak coincides with the metal site  <dig>  . the latter is situated between the carbonyl oxygen of ile <dig> and the carboxylate of asp <dig> and corresponds to the high-affinity metal site  <cit> . the 'metal site 1' peak was present in all three active sites, whereas the density for the inositol-1-phosphate site was best defined in subunit c . we consider it likely that the observed density represents a weakly-bound molecule of octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, a reagent used as an additive during crystallisation. whether or not the density peak a metal site  <dig> represents a divalent cation could not be verified.

dimer interface and assembly state
the present crystal structure comprises two apparent dimers of suhb. one dimer is formed between the ncs-related subunits a and c, while the second dimer results from crystallographic symmetry, pairing two symmetry-related copies of subunit b. as a result of ncs restraints applied during the refinement no substantial difference between the two independent dimers is observed at the interface. the suhb dimers also superimpose closely with the dimers of the human and bovine impase enzymes, whereby the dimer interface is formed by analogous secondary structure elements. these include helix α <dig>  the strand β <dig>  the β9-α  <dig> loop, helix α <dig>  and the β10-α <dig> and α7-β <dig> loops. in the superposition, which is based on secondary structure matching, helices α <dig> of the two protomers are positioned opposite to each other , contributing approximately 30% of the buried surface area . it seems noteworthy that in suhb the axes of these two helices are spaced  <dig>  Å apart whereas in the eukaryotic enzymes that spacing is approximately  <dig> Å . the discrepancy can be attributed to alanine residues  <dig> and  <dig> being positioned at the centre of this interface , while the side chains of a leucine at position  <dig> occupy the corresponding space in human impase.

the interface of the suhb dimer buries a total of  <dig> Å <dig> of solvent accessible surface, calculated using the pisa interface server  <cit> , or  <dig> Å <dig> per monomer. in terms of buried surface area hydrophobic interactions clearly dominate over h-bonds . although the residues located at the interface include a number of polar and charged side chains  only one ionic interaction is seen. in human impase distinctly more solvent accessible surface is buried in the interface . contacts across the interface include  <dig> ionic interactions, while the number of h-bonds  is about the same as in suhb. one factor explaining the difference in size of the interface, at least in part, is the disordered 'mobile loop' in suhb. in the apo structure of human impase , the α1-α <dig> loop is also disordered, reducing the total of buried solvent accessible surface per monomer from  <dig> Å <dig> to  <dig> Å <dig>  thus disorder of this loop accounts partially for the observed discrepancy.

the analysis of the dimer interface using the pisa server suggested that dimerisation of suhb might not be constitutive. based on molecular contacts at the interface, pisa calculates a 'complexation significance score'  that on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig> indicates the probability that a packing interface generated by crystal symmetry might represent a 'real' interface  <cit> . the css for the dimer interface of suhb is  <dig> , compared to a score of  <dig>  for the dimer interface of human impase , suggesting that dimerisation was merely due to crystal packing. we analysed self-association of suhb by analytical ultracentrifugation  in sedimentation velocity mode. to our surprise, but consistent with the prediction by pisa, we found that suhb is predominantly monomeric, with the peak at molecular weight  <dig>  da closely matching the calculated mass of the suhb monomer . however, with increasing protein concentration a second peak at molecular weight of  <dig>  da appears, and this peak becomes more pronounced, at the expense of the main peak, when  <dig> mm mg2+ is added to the buffer . we verified by sds gel electrophoresis that the preparation of suhb used in this experiment did not contain a contaminant that could explain the peak at  <dig>  da .

these data suggested that suhb, at protein concentrations in the order of  <dig> mg.ml- <dig>  exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, but that mg2+, which is required for activity, might shift self assembly to the dimer state. the underestimate in molecular weight of the dimer peak is due to the fitting of a single frictional coefficient to two species that have differing frictional ratios. in addition, the appearance of two separate peaks in the molecular weight profile with increasing concentration indicates that the off-rate for dimerisation is slow compared with the time of sedimentation. values for the off-rate for this regime are therefore estimated to be 10- <dig> < koff < 10- <dig>  <cit> . analysing the sedimentation velocity of suhb in the presence of increasing concentrations of mg2+, confirmed that in the absence of mg2+ the monomer form is strongly preferred . yet, as mg2+ increases in concentration  two features are observed: first, the dimer peak increases in height, at the expense of the monomer peak; second, the monomer and dimer peaks shift towards each other until, at  <dig> mm mg2+, a broad skewed distribution of the sedimentation coefficient is observed , suggesting a gradual transition from slow to fast exchange between the two assembly states due to an increase in the off-rate of dimerisation. increasing the concentration of mg2+ further, the dimer peak eventually becomes the dominant species in the c distribution .

next, we examined whether the inhibitor li+ influenced dimerization. at an enzyme concentration of  <dig>  mg.ml- <dig> and in the presence of  <dig> mm mg2+, increasing concentrations of li+ amplify the effect of mg2+-induced dimerization, with the dimer peak becoming dominant over the monomer peak . however on its own li+ promotes dimerization only very weakly, if at all . furthermore the c distribution obtained for  <dig> mm mg2+ matches almost perfectly the one obtained in presence of  <dig> mm mg2+ and  <dig> mm li+. calcium, which binds to impase on identical sites as mg2+, but does not activate, strongly promotes dimerization, while edta reverses mg2+-induced dimerization .

discussion
the present crystal structure of m. tuberculosis suhb confirms a highly conserved structural scaffold of impases in mycobacteria with respect to overall fold and active site geometry, in spite of a low level of overall sequence identity  relative to human impase. the structural similarity correlates with similar biochemical characteristics – activation by magnesium, inhibition by lithium, specificity for inositol-1-phosphate and exclusion of fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate as a substrate. it has been noted previously that the mg2+-dependence of impase activity of suhb resembles more closely that of the thermophilic species thermotoga maritima, archeoglobus fulgidus and methanococcus jannaschii  <cit>  in that activation is maintained over a concentration range of mg2+ in the order of  <dig> mm, whereas in eukaryotic impases mg2+ becomes inhibitory above  <dig> mm. such comparison ignores, however, that unlike these thermophilic enzymes suhb does not hydrolyze fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate, and remains sensitive to li+ . given that the active site of suhb, in its 'non-mobile' part, displays the same highly conserved framework of side chains coordinating the three metal sites as the eukaryotic orthologues, we postulate that differences in mg2+-dependence of activity between suhb and eukaryotic impases must be linked on the one hand to structural differences in the mobile α1-α <dig> loop, and secondly to the apparent link between mg2+-driven dimerization and activation of suhb. in impases and the tetrameric impase/fbpases the α1-α <dig> loop, when ordered, stabilizes the third of the three catalytic metal sites through bridging water molecules  <cit> . the α1-α <dig> loop contributes significantly to the dimer interface. this is apparent when comparing the buried solvent-accessible surface in the dimer interface of human impase between the ordered and disordered state of the mobile loop. thus, we anticipate that ordering of the α1-α <dig> loop in suhb, which is  <dig> residues longer compared to human impase, will expand the dimer interface and help stabilize the dimer state. while suhb is driven to the dimer state at high protein concentrations in the absence of metal ions, as was the case during crystallization, it is evident that mg2+ strongly promotes dimerization at low concentrations. lithium amplifies the mg2+-induced effect, yet li+ alone does not noticeably shift the monomer dimer equilibrium. these observations correlate with the characteristics of metal binding in the active site, which is known to promote ordering of the α1-α <dig> loop. according to 7li-nmr binding data, lithium occupies a single site per monomer in impase  <cit> , and various indirect evidence points to li+ displacing mg2+ from either site  <dig> or site  <dig>  <cit> . a lysine residue in the mobile loop  that coordinates the third metal site via hydrogen bonds to bridging water molecules has been shown to critically influence li+-sensitivity  <cit> , and this lysine is conserved in suhb . given that the α1-α <dig> loop is disordered, the present structure leaves open the precise geometry of this loop in the ordered state and whether lys <dig> in suhb coordinates the third metal site. yet, lithium sensitivity of suhb , the debilitating effect on activity of the w234a mutation, and the loss of li+ inhibition through the l81a mutation  <cit>  – a mutation that removes a stabilising hydrophobic contact to the conserved trp <dig> in the active site – hint that metal binding induces ordering of the α1-α <dig> loop in suhb in a similar fashion as in the eukaryotic orthologues.

previously, size exclusion chromatography experiments with  <dig> mm edta present in the buffer had indicated that e. coli suhb formed monomers and it had been inferred that the e. coli enzyme was active in the monomeric form  <cit> . the parallels between metal-dependent self-association and enzymatic activation in m. tuberculosis suhb strongly suggest that dimerization is linked to loading of the three metal sites in the active site, and that phosphatase activity occurs in the dimer state, although we are not in a position to determine whether dimerization is required for activity. if dimerization were required for enzymatic activity of suhb, this would at least in part explain the wide range of mg2+ concentrations over which activity is maintained, as the transition to the dimer state is not complete up to at least  <dig> mm mg2+. several caveats go with this rationale. first, the comparison of the activity and auc data is complicated by the fact that metal binding is cooperative with substrate binding  <cit>  and inositol-1-phosphate was not present in the auc experiments. also, while dimerisation appears to correlate with loading of the metal positions in the active site, we cannot rule out the possibility that the dimer interface contains one or more metal binding sites, which could drive dimerisation. however, the present structure, in line with related impases, and a series of metal-soaking experiments with suhb crystals provided no indication for such a site .

crystal structures of eukaryotic impases, a refolding study and auc analysis of human impase  <dig>  in the absence of mg2+, consistently indicate constitutive dimerization of the eukaryotic orthologue  <cit> . it is not clear what mechanistic purpose dimerization serves with respect to the enzymatic properties of impases, and why dimerization should be constitutive in eukarya, but not in bacteria. unlike the tetrameric fbpases, which are regulated by an allosteric mechanism involving changes in the relative orientation of the subunits in the tetramer , no regulatory mechanism for impase has been reported that invokes dimerization of the enzyme. nevertheless, mg2+ has been shown to moderately enhance thermal stability of m. tuberculosis suhb, which correlates to some extent with phosphohydrolase activity of suhb peaking at about 80°c  <cit> . while this latter property is mirrored by e. coli suhb  <cit>  and m. tuberculosis cysq  <cit>  it has not been tested whether at such high temperatures suhb still discriminates between substrates. thus, while dimerization may increase thermal stability, the functional role of mg2+-induced dimerization of suhb in the physiological regime of the tubercle bacillus is not clear.

suhb – a template for the other m. tuberculosis impases?
the impase-like genes in m. tuberculosis display considerable sequence diversity relative to each other. in the multiple sequence alignment , suhb and rv <dig> align with 30% sequence identity, while impa and cysq score significantly lower  relative to any sequence in figure  <dig> . searching the pdb for homologues of known structure, using blast, showed that suhb still represents the best template in terms of sequence identity, although the differences to the next nearest homologue are small . based on the search results, one could speculate on the substrate specificities of the two uncharacterised gene products, rv <dig> and impa. the gene product with the most divergent sequence, cysq, has been characterised as a dual impase/fbpase  <cit> . consistent with this finding, searching the pdb with the cysq sequence returns two dual activity enzymes, rattus norvegicus 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate/inositol- <dig> -bisphosphate phosphatase   <cit> , and t. maritima impase/fbpase tm <dig>  <cit>  as the closest homologues of known structure. likewise, the search results mirror the close relationship of suhb to the eukaryotic impases, which strongly prefer inositol-1-phosphate as substrate. interestingly, the dual activity impase/fbpase tm <dig> appears as the top hit for both impa and rv <dig> .

analysing the multiple sequence alignment that underlies table  <dig>  more closely, it is interesting to note that enzymes that are specific for inositol-1-phosphate and exclude fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate carry a glutamic acid or glutamine at position  <dig> , whereas asp, his, ser or thr are found in enzymes that hydrolyze both substrates or are specific for fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate. in the inositol-1-phosphate-bound structure of human impase  <cit> , the corresponding residue, glu <dig>  forms hydrogen bonds to the c <dig> and c <dig> hydroxyls of the inositol ring. in addition to the h-bond between asp <dig>  and the c6-hydroxyl, these h-bonds are the only side chain-mediated, specificity-determining contacts between the inositol moiety and the enzyme. in the structural superimposition it is evident that an asp  at this position is unlikely to confer selectivity as the distance between the terminal group of the side chain and the sugar hydroxyls becomes too large. discrimination against fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate is rooted primarily in steric clashes of the 6-phosphate the β9-α <dig> loop. as a result of deletions relative to human impase, a much shorter β9-α <dig> loop in fbpases and dual activity impase/fbpases provide the space to accommodate the second phosphate group. thus, deletions in this region in addition to substitutions of glu/gln at position  <dig> could be indicative of dual specificity. analysing the sequences of impa and rv <dig> in light of these considerations suggests that at least rv <dig> is restricted to inositol-1-phosphate, whereas the case is less clear cut for impa. the latter carries a ser at the position corresponding to glu <dig>  but displays no significant deletion relative to suhb between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas cysq by the standards of both criteria falls into the category of the dual specificity enzymes, consistent with published biochemical data  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the structure of m. tuberculosis suhb, providing a structural template for the four impase-like enzymes in this organism. while resembling eukaryotic impases in terms of structural scaffold, specificity for inositol-1-phosphate, requirement for mg2+ and inhibition by li+, suhb clearly diverges from the paradigm of constitutive dimerization of bona fide impases. the present data support a model of mg2+-dependent dimerization, where loading of the three catalytic metal sites in the active site induces ordering of the mobile loop, promoting dimerization likely by expanding the dimer interface. the active site of suhb presents a highly conserved scaffold of side chains forming the metal- and substrate-binding site, yet additional specificity-determining contacts are expected with the weakly conserved β9-α <dig> loop. sequence and structural comparisons lead us to predict that the essential gene product rv <dig> represents a bona fide impase, while such may or may not be the case for impa.
