BACKGROUND
bacteria present in rumen synthesize b vitamins in generally sufficient amounts to meet their host’s requirements  <cit> . notwithstanding, high-producing dairy cows could benefit from vitamin b <dig> and b <dig> supplements, especially during the critical period around calving and in early lactation . vitamin b <dig> plays a major role in dna synthesis and in de novo formation of methyl groups required for the methylation cycle. on the other hand, vitamin b <dig> is involved in two metabolic pathways: the remethylation cycle and as coenzyme of the methylmalonyl-coa mutase. the former, closely related to folate metabolism, is required for the regeneration of methionine and tetrahydrofolate, whereas the later allows the entry of propionate in the krebs cycle and gluconeogenesis  <cit> .

results from two studies suggest that supplementary vitamin b <dig> might improve efficiency of nutrient utilization, especially for milk protein synthesis  <cit> . this observation is supported by the observation that in vitro hormonal stimulation of milk protein synthesis by mammary gland explants of dairy cows increased expression of  <dig> genes; among them,  <dig> genes related to folate metabolism, folr <dig> and aldh1l <dig>  <cit> . the former is a folate transporter allowing the entry of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate into the cells whereas the latter is involved in purine synthesis. as vitamin b <dig> supplement increases milk protein synthesis, it would be interesting to investigate whether similar transcriptomic process takes place in vivo when vitamin supplements are provided to lactating cows.

a combined supplement of vitamins b <dig> and b <dig> given during the peripartum period and in early lactation altered energy partitioning during the first weeks of lactation as compared to control cows  <cit> . however, the mode of action of this supplement is not fully elucidated. we observed that a combined supplement of vitamins b <dig> and b <dig> increases whole-body rate of appearance of glucose which is the sum of glucose from portal absorption, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis  <cit> . propionate originating from rumen fermentation is the major precursor of glucose in cows  <cit>  and contributes up to 60 % of glucose flux rate  <cit> . for ruminants, the glucose, essential for synthesis of milk lactose, is mostly provided by liver  through gluconeogenesis  <cit> .

it has been shown that at the onset of lactation, the liver as well as the mammary gland undergo numerous adaptations to support milk synthesis  <cit> . in early lactation, feed intake is not sufficient to meet the nutrient demand for milk production, leading to a negative energy balance  <cit> . furthermore, the liver undergoes extensive physiological and biochemical changes mediated by significant alterations in hepatic gene expression in an attempt to re-establish metabolic homeostasis and to counteract the adverse effects of negative energy balance  <cit> . in addition, during this period, the mammary gland is actively remodeling. in fact, by investigating the transcriptional response of the mammary gland during early lactation, connor et al.  <cit>  observed changes in mammary expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, cellular remodeling, and nutrient transport.

therefore, the aim of the present project was to profile the genes for which expression undergoes major changes in hepatic and mammary tissues of lactating dairy cows according to vitamins b <dig> and b <dig> supply.

RESULTS
at week  <dig> of lactation, there was no treatment effect  on dry matter intake, milk production, milk total solid yields as well as milk component contents. dry matter intake, milk production, milk total solid yields, milk fat, protein and lactose contents averaged  <dig>   kg/d,  <dig>   kg/d,  <dig>   kg/d,  <dig>   g/kg,  <dig>   g/kg, and  <dig>   g/kg, respectively. during the seven weeks following calving, body condition score losses tended to be reduced  in cows receiving the vitamin b <dig> supplements, alone or combined with vitamin b <dig>  plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate were also lower , averaging  <dig> and 243 μm  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm  for cows receiving or not receiving supplementary vitamin b <dig>  respectively.

the microarray analysis revealed that, as compared to control cows receiving no vitamin supplement, the vitamin treatments significantly changed  the expression of some genes by more than 2-fold in hepatic and mammary tissues . the expression of  <dig> genes in hepatic tissue was modified by at least one of the vitamin treatment compared to control cows . from this panel of  <dig> genes,  <dig> could be assigned to a biological process using the panther classification system . out of these  <dig> genes, expression of  <dig> genes was analyzed by qpcr . although nine false positive genes were observed, five genes were confirmed to be differentially expressed in the group of cows supplemented with vitamins.fig.  <dig> number of genes  influenced by the vitamin supplementation. supplements of vitamin b <dig> , vitamin b <dig>  or both vitamins  were given to dairy cows. the venn diagram shows the number of significant genes. the number of probes is bracketed “()”.  with more than 2-fold change between the control group and each treatment group in  hepatic tissue and  mammary tissue

all genes modulated in the liver by the vitamins treatment, including those that were not found or classified by the panther system are listed. the fold change observed by microarray analysis varies from − <dig>  to  <dig>  and only significantly  expressed genes  are shown

the expression of two genes was significantly modified in liver by the b <dig> treatment as illustrated in the venn diagram . one gene that also significantly down-regulated by the b <dig> treatment was confirmed by qpcr for these cows. this repression of dlk <dig> in liver was down-regulated by the three vitamin treatments . the b <dig> treatment had the greatest impact on the liver with  <dig> genes  whose expression level differed by more than 2-fold compared to control .

among the  <dig> genes affected by the b <dig> treatment, four genes were also influenced in cows receiving the b9 + b <dig> treatment: the methallothioneins 1a  and 1e , the transmembrane glycoprotein , and an uncharacterized protein  . expression of two of these genes  was studied by qpcr . this analysis confirmed the repression of mtia in liver of cows receiving b <dig> and b9 + b <dig> treatments. results from the microarray analysis indicated an up-regulation of the expression of gpnmb with both b <dig> and b9 + b <dig> treatments. the qpcr analysis showed a numerical but not statistically significant increase with these treatments probably due to the large variation in the expression for this gene among the limited number of animals of this study . among the other  <dig> genes affected by the b <dig> treatment, the expression of seven genes were studied by qpcr but no effect were confirmed for  <dig> of them . only the expression of the g0/g1switch  <dig> gene  was up-regulated in liver of cows receiving the b <dig> treatment as compared to control .

in addition to these four genes influenced by b <dig> treatment, alone and in combination with b <dig>   <dig> other genes were affected when both vitamins were administrated simultaneously to the cows; four genes were studied by qpcr. two of them, namely the haptoprotein  and lysyl oxidase-like  <dig> , were confirmed as being respectively down and up-regulated by the combined treatment. nevertheless, the expression of loxl <dig> was also up-regulated in liver of b <dig> cows whereas, the expression of hp was down-regulated by all vitamin treatments . no difference in expression of gsta <dig> and slc22a <dig> could be detected.

in mammary gland, the b <dig> treatment modified the expression of nine genes by 2-fold as compared to cows receiving no vitamin supplement. the b <dig> treatment affected five genes and the expression of five genes was influenced by the b9 + b <dig> treatment . the b9 + b <dig> shared one gene with the b <dig> treatment. based on results from the microarray analysis, three genes whose expression was modified by the b <dig> treatment , cell death-inducing dffa-like effector a , the androgen binding protein beta-like , and the periostin  genes were studied by qpcr in addition to some candidate genes . out of the  <dig> genes analyzed by qpcr, two genes were confirmed; then, the percentage of false positive in the mammary was 82 %. rab <dig> and postn were significantly up-regulated respectively by the b <dig> and b <dig> as compared to control . out of the  <dig> genes affected in the mammary gland by vitamin supplements,  <dig> were classified using panther classification system .fig.  <dig> expression of genes in mammary gland measured by quantitative pcr according to treatments. control: no vitamin supplement; b9: vitamin b <dig> supplement; b12: vitamin b <dig> supplement; b9 + b12: combined supplement of vitamins b <dig> and b <dig>  means different from the control treatment are indicated by *** when p value ≤  <dig> , ** when p values were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and * when there was a trend with p values between  <dig>  and  <dig>

all genes modulated in the mammary tissue by the vitamins treatment, including those that were not found or classified by the panther system are listed. the fold change, as using flexarray microarray analysis, varies from − <dig>  to  <dig>  and only significantly  expressed genes  are shown


aidentification of the major biological processes of the genes differentially expressed in mammary tissue following supplementation with vitamin b <dig> , vitamin b <dig>  or both vitamins  as compared to no vitamin treatment 



gene symbols were uploaded to the panther workspace in order to classify the genes of interest by selecting the bos taurus reference gene list based on the selected organism  <cit> . notwithstanding, some genes in both tissues  could not be assigned to any biological process or molecular function category by panther classification system . it is also possible that there is no experimental data to support their biological annotation.

discussion
microarray analysis was used to investigate the effects of vitamin b <dig> and b <dig> supplements given alone or in combination during the peripartum early lactation period on liver and mammary gland tissues. the expression of only a limited number of genes was modulated by the vitamin treatments in both tissues, which suggests a subtle vitamin effect on the tissue metabolism that would have been better characterized using a larger population. notwithstanding, the qpcr analyses show that, in liver, expression of keys genes, such as dlk <dig>  loxl <dig>  g0s <dig>  gsta <dig>  hp, mt1a, ifi <dig> and sfrp <dig> was modulated at different extents  by the vitamin treatments. delta-like  <dig> homolog  is a surface marker of hematopoietic progenitor cells  associated with less differentiated hepatocellular phenotypes  <cit>  and it has been shown to act in vitro as an inhibitor of notch signaling  <cit>  to promote liver regeneration  <cit> . interestingly, dlk <dig> is an imprinted gene which is involved in lipid metabolic reprogramming  <cit> . an increased concentration of this biomarker in blood serum is associated with hepatic cancer  <cit>  whereas downregulation of dlk <dig> expression through an epigenetic mechanism contributes to attenuate liver disease  <cit> . because vitamin b <dig> plays a major role in de novo formation of methyl groups and vitamin b <dig> is required for the remethylation cycle, we can speculate that dlk <dig> expression could also be repressed in the liver of the lactating cows through an epigenetic mechanism. because dlk <dig> suppresses glucose production and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation in hepatocytes  <cit> , supplementation of both vitamins b <dig> and b <dig> might increase liver metabolism through a genomic imprinting mechanism which negatively impacts the dlk <dig> pathway.

lysyl oxidase-like member  <dig> , a matrix-remodeling enzymes, is extracellularly secreted and significantly contributes to ecm deposition  <cit> . activity of lysyl oxidase  and lox like proteins are correlated to collagen and elastin deposition and, in adult mammals, are essential to tissue maintenance  <cit> . recent studies have provided compelling evidence that g0s <dig> is abundantly expressed in metabolically active tissues such as liver, and acts as a molecular brake on triglyceride catabolism  <cit> . triglyceride hydrolase activity of adipose triglyceride lipase can be selectively inhibited by g0s <dig>  <cit> . hence, increasing the expression of g0s <dig> decreased lipolysis  <cit>  which is supported by the reduction of plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids in cows receiving vitamin b <dig> supplements, alone or combined with vitamin b <dig> in the present study. although increased ifi <dig> expression was not significant, the pattern was highly similar to g0s <dig> thus suggesting a similar b <dig> supplement effect on the liver for this gene. expression of the alpha-inducible protein  <dig>  is up-regulated during inflammatory wound repair process  <cit>  and expression of this gene also alters immune response and mitochondrial function  <cit> . interestingly, dlk <dig> locus expression is also associated with a restriction of the mitochondrial metabolism  <cit> . these gene expression patterns support the hypothesis that both vitamins b <dig> and b <dig> improve the hepatic function which might reduce metabolic stress during the transition period and early lactation of dairy cows. this is further supported by the marked reduction of the hp and mt1a genes. the liver is the major site for the synthesis of acute phase proteins including haptoglobin  and metallothionein 1a   <cit> . during stress response, it is reported that physiological processes aimed on redistribution of energy utilization in specific organs stimulating mobilization of body reserves. in mammary gland, administration of the three vitamin treatments had a very limited effect on gene expression as described above. interestingly, in the present study, whereas vitamin treatments had no effect on milk total solids yield and dry matter intake, vitamin b <dig> supplements, given alone or in combination with vitamin b <dig>  decreased body condition score losses during the first weeks of lactation as well as plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate  <cit>  suggesting an improvement in energy balance for these cows.

in the present study, all the genes that have their expression affected by the vitamin treatments in the liver, are involved in tissue repair, resorption of inflammation and lipid metabolism although no mode of action can be clearly identified. during the first weeks of lactation, dairy cows are generally in negative energy balance because nutrient intake increases less rapidly than nutrient demand for initiation of lactation which leads to mobilization of body reserves. cows are losing body condition score and non-esterified fatty acids are released from adipose tissues and their plasma concentrations increased. during this period, dairy cows are also prone to liver steatosis because hepatic uptake of non-esterified fatty acids is greater than the amounts oxidized or secreted by the liver  <cit> . accumulation of lipids in liver affects integrity and function of hepatic cells  <cit> ; in response, liver parenchymal cells produce an acute-phase glycoprotein haptoglobulin  <cit> . because a decrease in dlk <dig> can improved fatty acid oxidation from hepatocytes  <cit> , an improved β-oxidation of non-esterified fatty acids in liver could help to reduce ketone body formation and plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate. the improvement in energy balance observed in cows receiving supplementary vitamin b <dig>  alone or combined with vitamin b <dig>  likely reduced the liver burden caused by mobilization of body fat reserves which could explain the changes in hepatic gene expression described above. for instance, the increase of loxl <dig> and g0s <dig> strongly support that these treatments protect body fat from catabolism. prevention of liver damage or improved liver performance is not only important for maintaining liver function but also for general health of high-yielding dairy cows.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a supplement of vitamin b <dig>  given alone or in combination with vitamin b <dig>  reduced mobilization of body fat reserves and hepatic lipid catabolism in early lactation. changes in expression of genes described above support the hypothesis that hepatic tissue integrity in early lactation was improved by these vitamin supplements.
