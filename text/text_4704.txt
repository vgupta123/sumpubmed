BACKGROUND
the mitochondrial genome is typically non-recombining, has a relatively high substitution rate, and has a smaller effective population size than the nuclear genome  <cit> . these properties can increase the probability of congruence between the mitochondrial gene tree and the species tree, helping to resolve relationships between recently divergent taxa  <cit> . under some conditions, however, phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial dna  sequence data can fail to resolve the relationships among taxa into a fully bifurcating tree. theoretical and empirical studies suggest that greater phylogenetic resolution and bootstrap support for inter-specific nodes should be achievable by increasing the amount of sequence data  <cit> . additionally, including sequence data from more than one gene will reduce the influence of any variation between genes in phylogenetic signal due to selection or the effects of stochastic lineage sorting  <cit> .

however, not all polytomic relationships are 'soft', and some cannot be resolved by adding sequence data  <cit> . in some cases even complete mitochondrial genomes have failed to resolve multifurcating relationships . although unlikely  <cit> , a 'hard' molecular polytomy could be the result of a true simultaneous speciation event into multiple daughter species  <cit> . such events could occur when multiple populations of an ancestral species become simultaneously isolated during periods of rapid environmental change  <cit> . simultaneous adaptive radiation into multiple species could also occur in sympatry due to intra-specific competition and assortative mating if species occupy a narrow niche width  <cit> .

the use of high-throughput sequencing and pooled tagging methods  <cit>  has the potential to generate large amounts of manifold-coverage sequence data for large numbers of samples quickly and at a relatively low cost, allowing improved resolution of phylogenetic relationships to be achieved routinely . such an approach can allow the differentiation between rapid and simultaneous cladogenesis and, when combined with additional tests, can determine if a molecular polytomy reflects a true species polytomy .

previous phylogenetic studies using a variety of markers have suggested an episodic rapid rate of speciation within the delphinidae family  <cit> . this has resulted in several long-standing uncertainties in the phylogenetic relationships within this group. analysis of sequences of the cytochrome b gene   <cit>  led to a number of suggested taxonomic revisions from previous classifications based on morphology  <cit> . however, a number of these revisions had poor support and required further analysis, e.g., the inclusion of grampus griseus , and removal of orcinus orca  from the globicephalinae subfamily, and the grouping of o. orca with the genus orcaella into a proposed orcininae subfamily. the genus lagenorhynchus was found to be polyphyletic, with l. albirostris and l. acutus removed from the remaining four congeners and not found to be closely related to each other  <cit> . there was high support for paraphyly of the genera tursiops and stenella  <cit> , which has been subsequently strengthened by mitogenomic and multi-locus analyses  <cit> . more recent studies, which included both mtdna and nuclear dna , suggested an additional revision of the placement of steno bredanensis  with orcaella  <cit> ; however, another multi-locus study grouped s. bredanensis with the sotalia genus, consistent with previous classifications  <cit> . these more recent analyses using both nudna and mtdna  <cit>  have failed to confirm all of the revisions suggested by leduc et al.  <cit>  and have not produced consistent estimates of relationships within this family. for example the ordering of the branches containing the species o. orca and l. albirostris, and the subfamilies delphininae, globicephilinae, and lissodelphininae has differed considerably among studies  <cit> . in addition to being highly variable, the placement of l. albirostris has typically been one of the most weakly supported  <cit> .

here we estimate the phylogeny of delphinidae using complete mitogenomes generated using high-throughput sequencing. this is the first time complete mitogenome sequences have been published for five of the species, and mitogenome sequences from a further three species have previously only been used as outgroup species for an intra-specific phylogenetic study on the killer whale  <cit> . in total, mitogenome sequences from  <dig> of the  <dig> extant species within delphinidae were included in the analyses. this case study on a rapidly radiating group is one of the first to test the power of large sequence datasets produced by parallel-tagged high-throughput sequencing in combination with improved analytical techniques to address long-standing phylogenetic uncertainties. specifically we test three revisions suggested by leduc et al.  <cit>  regarding the placement of o. orca, g. griseus, and l. albirostris, and a further suggested revision regarding the placement of s. bredanensis  <cit> . we ultimately test the hypothesis that these uncertainties result from a true species polytomy caused by simultaneous speciation.

RESULTS
sequencing
in total  <dig> mitogenome sequences were generated for this study, including multiple representatives per species. eight of these sequences were incomplete , table 1; additional file 1), however at least  <dig> complete genome was sequenced for each species. the  <dig> complete sequences had on average 20× coverage of the whole mitogenome of approximately  <dig>  bp. in combination with previously published mtdna genome sequences we were able to use this dataset to reconstruct the most complete and highly resolved mitogenome phylogeny of delphinidae to date .

phylogenetic analyses
phylogenetic estimates were consistent across bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods used in this study, including partitioned and unpartitioned analyses on the full data set, and a subset consisting of a single representative per species. with one exception we were able to reject alternative topologies . based on bayes factors, we found strong support for allowing different partitions of the mitogenome alignment to have distinct evolutionary models in the phylogenetic analysis . although the harmonic-mean estimators of bayes factors such as those implemented in the software packages used here can be unreliable  <cit> , the magnitude of our estimated bayes factors  make it unlikely that we have been misled into selecting a suboptimal partitioning strategy for this alignment. in the partitioned analysis, the mean substitution rate across the  <dig> protein-coding genes and  <dig> rrna genes was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions/site/my, with a 95% highest posterior density  interval of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> -  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions/site/my. the coefficient of variations of rates was  <dig>  , indicating the presence of substantial rate variation among lineages. the fastest data partition  evolved at about  <dig>  times the rate of the slowest data partition .

tested alternative topologies are shown in figure  <dig>  obs = observed log-likelihood difference to the best topology; au = approximately unbiased; np = bootstrap probability of the topology ; bp = np with  <dig> non-scaled sets of  <dig>  bootstrap replicates; pp = bayesian posterior probabilities of the model; kh = kishino-hasegawa; sh = shimodeira-hasegawa; wkh = weighted kh; wsh = weighted sh.

our analyses strongly support the placement by leduc et al.  <cit>  of grampus griseus within the globicephalinae subfamily, a result that now finds wide support from a range of different markers  <cit> . in contrast to leduc et al.'s  <cit>  revisions we were able to reject the suggested grouping of orcinus orca with orcaella: the proposed orcininae subfamily. instead we find that o. orca is sister taxon to the rest of the globicephalinae subfamily, which also contains the orcaella genus. we were also able to reject the placement of steno bredanensis in globicephalinae as proposed by caballero et al.  <cit>  and supported by mcgowen et al.  <cit> . traditionally, and based on morphology alone, s. bredanensis has been placed in the subfamily stenoninae with the genera sousa and sotalia  <cit> . sousa chinensis has since been moved to the delphininae subfamily and our analyses suggest that s. bredanensis is sister taxon to the rest of the species within this clade. membership of these subfamilies appears to be supported by shared derived morphological characteristics, however, a thorough cladistic morphological analysis at the genus level remains lacking.

our analyses suggest lagenorhynchus albirostris and the delphinidae family are sister taxa, but neither approximately unbiased nor other topological tests  were able to reject an alternative topology . however, maximum-likelihood bootstrap values and bayesian posterior probabilities supported l. albirostris as the sister taxon of the delphinidae family , leaving only marginal support for the two alternative topologies tested . the positioning of l. albirostris and the three major delphinidae subfamilies, globicephalinae, delphininae, and lissodelphininae , has been inconsistent among published studies . such phylogenetic uncertainty suggests that this may represent a true species polytomy. however, unlike previous studies, our positioning of l. albirostris had high support , and the support of approximately unbiased tests for an alternative topology was only marginally significant . periods of rapid environmental change can lead to rapid or even simultaneous speciation events, which would result in a hard polytomy  <cit> . our time-calibrated mitogenomic phylogeny placed the splitting of the three major subfamilies and l. albirostris during the late miocene , a period of fluctuating temperature and sea level  <cit> . this dating is consistent with the period during which steeman et al.  <cit>  detected a significant increase in net diversification rates within delphinidae. therefore, we suggest that a rapid radiation during the period of extreme environmental fluctuations in the late miocene best explains the lower support for the phylogenetic positioning of l. albirostris within delphinidae.

consistent with geographical distribution, morphological differences, and a high number of fixed differences in the mtdna control region  <cit> , we found a deep phylogenetic divergence between orcaella brevirostris and o. heinsohni . this divergence is dated to the pliocene , a period characterised by elevated cyclical fluctuations in sea temperatures and sea levels with an overall trend of cooling temperatures and an increasing west-to-east sea surface temperature  difference across the equatorial pacific  <cit> . our data also indicate a rapid radiation of the other extant species within the globicephalinae subfamily during this period of climatic variation.

caveats and recommended future work
the inclusion of nudna loci in some of the recent studies  <cit>  may explain the incongruencies noted above. the mitogenome is a single, maternally inherited, haploid locus and might not wholly reflect the underlying pattern of population divergence and lineage formation . nuclear genes can have greater resolving power for deep-level phylogenetic inference  <cit>  and, when combined with whole mitogenomes, they have also been able to improve resolution in cases of apparent incomplete lineage sorting due to rapid radiations  <cit> . historical hybridization is another potential source of incongruence between mtdna and nudna trees  <cit> . this is a particularly important factor to consider if the biological species concept rather than the phylogenetic species concept is being used to define species boundaries, as reproductive isolation is a key criterion for species status under the former  <cit> .

a recent study based on the control regions of the two pilot whale species, globicephala melas and g. macrorhynchus, found no support for reciprocal monophyly  <cit> . it was suggested that this could be due to incomplete lineage sorting or a lack of sufficient data. we found complete lineage sorting with high monophyletic support for all species for which we had multiple representatives, including the two pilot whale species . however, we had small sample numbers from a limited geographical range for all taxa. including single or low numbers of representatives of each species assumes that the individuals sequenced and included in the phylogenetic analyses are representative of a reciprocally monophyletic clade  <cit> . however, increased sampling may reveal instances of paraphyly or polyphyly  <cit> . increased sampling and mitogenome sequencing, such as conducted on the killer whale  <cit> , is needed to confirm complete lineage sorting for the remaining species included in this study. increased taxon sampling, such as the inclusion of the species within the lissodelphininae, may also further reduce phylogenetic error  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have used complete mtdna genome sequences to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within the delphinidae with high support. future studies could apply similar methods to resolve para- and polyphyletic genera, e.g., the four lagenorhynchus species within the subfamily lissodelphininae  <cit> . our study further supports previous empirical and theoretical studies  <cit> , that increasing sequence data can improve phylogenetic resolution, even in species known to have undergone rapid radiation in the recent past, and can help to discriminate between hard and soft polytomies. however, some clades will remain unresolved, most likely due to simultaneous speciation events  <cit> . with current high-throughput sequencing techniques, animal mitogenomes can be sequenced relatively quickly and at low cost, and are an attractive candidate for future phylogenetic analyses, particularly if combined with current analytical tools that can aid in the reconstruction of challenging phylogenies.
