BACKGROUND
the rcd <dig>  protein is an important regulator of plant stress and developmental responses  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana it is a member of a small protein family consisting of rcd <dig> and five sros . rcd <dig> was first identified as a plant gene able to complement the oxidative stress sensitive phenotype of a yeast strain deficient in the yap <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . since then it has also been characterized as a major regulator of plant ozone  tolerance  <cit> . a loss-of-function mutation in rcd <dig> results in highly pleiotropic phenotypes including increased sensitivity to extracellular reactive oxygen species , resistance to chloroplastic ros formation by paraquat  and ultraviolet radiation, salt sensitivity, aberrant leaf and rosette morphology, early flowering, altered nitric oxide and hormone  responses, as well as defects in developmental processes, such as root architecture and reproductive development  <cit> . while rcd <dig> displays a vast range of well-characterized phenotypes, the function of its closest ortholog, sro <dig>  is dispensable for normal plant development and stress response  <cit> . mutant sro <dig> plants exhibit only very subtle phenotypes  <cit> . however, loss of a single sro <dig> allele in rcd <dig> background results in severe developmental defects with the rcd <dig> sro <dig> double mutant displaying even more extreme phenotypes  <cit> . this demonstrates unequal genetic redundancy between rcd <dig> and sro <dig> in a. thaliana  <cit> . in species other than a. thaliana, several studies, mostly based on gene expression analysis, suggest roles for rcd <dig> and sro <dig> orthologs in hormone signaling, plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . however, the phylogenetic relationships of these proteins to the rcd1/sro gene family members in a. thaliana has so far not been characterized.

another member of the a. thaliana sro family, sro <dig> , is transcriptionally induced by ros in response to salt treatment and is required for the proper response to oxidative stress  <cit> . it forms an antisense overlapping gene pair with Î”1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase . in the presence of both transcripts, a 24-nucleotide sirna is formed, downregulating expression of p5cdh  <cit> . a salt stress responsive sro <dig> ortholog from tomato can functionally complement the a. thaliana sro <dig> mutant  <cit> . the other members of the sro protein family, sro <dig>  sro <dig> and sro <dig>  have not been functionally analyzed.

the domain composition of the sros is unique within plants. while two a. thaliana sro family members contain an n-terminal wwe domain , all of them are characterized by the possession of the core of the poly polymerase  domain and a conserved c-terminal rcd1-sro-taf <dig> domain   <cit> . the combination of parp and rst domain is specific to plants but the wwe-parp domain architecture is widely conserved in organisms as distantly related as humans. the wwe domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and predicted to have a globular structure  <cit> . however, in sros the function of the wwe domain in dimerization and other protein-protein interactions remains to be shown. the rst domain is a plant specific domain found in plant wwe-parps and taf4s , a component of the tfiid general transcription factor. the rst domain-bearing c-termini of rcd <dig> and sro <dig> are suggested to be critical for the interaction with several, mostly plant specific transcription factors  <cit> .

protein adp-ribosylation is a post-translational modification catalyzed by adp-ribosyl transferases  that are present in all eukaryotes except yeast  <cit> . the major classes of arts are the parps and mono transferases . parps attach single adp-ribose units to proteins and catalyze the elongation and branching of long poly chains. parps have roles in many processes, including cell death, dna repair, telomere stability, chromatin remodeling, transcription, and memory  <cit> . a. thaliana has three parps which most closely resemble classical dna dependent parps http://www.arabidopsis.org/. the presence of the catalytic core of the parp domain in rcd <dig> and sros suggests an art or related activity.

the marts attach a single adp-ribose unit to protein substrates. humans possess both ectoenzymes and intracellular endogenous marts  <cit> . to date, in plants no marts have been isolated or predicted by bioinformatics  <cit> . most known human intracellular marts resemble parps  <cit>  and have until recently been classified as parps  <cit> . there are  <dig> such human parps with various domain structures. hsparp <dig>  hsparp <dig>  hsparp <dig> and hsparp <dig> contain the wwe and parp domain together with other domains. hsparp <dig>  with only wwe and parp but no other conserved domains, is the human protein most similar in domain architecture to a. thaliana rcd <dig> and sro <dig> and has currently no known function. given the evolutionary distance between plants and humans it is not clear which, if any, of these proteins are functionally similar to the sros.

the identification of rcd <dig> orthologs in several plant species prompted us to investigate the sro protein family in a comparative manner. the availability of sequenced and annotated genomes allows the analysis of full gene families in silico. we compared the sro family in several species from evolutionarily divergent branches of the plant kingdom showing a different composition of the family in different plants. in addition, we suggest a naming convention for the family members. we identified the rst domain as a protein-protein interaction domain, analyzed the predicted function of the parp domain and studied the transcriptional regulation of the gene family members in a. thaliana. based on our findings we propose that, while sros contain a highly conserved parp domain, at least rcd <dig> does not possess adp-ribosyl transferase activity. bioinformatic comparisons suggest this is likely to also apply to several other sros.

RESULTS
based on their domain composition the a. thaliana sros could be divided into two structural types . type a sros contain an n-terminal wwe domain   <cit> , the catalytic core of the poly polymerase  domain and a c-terminal rcd1-sro-taf <dig>   <cit>  domain. the type b sros lack the wwe domain but possess the parp and rst domains.

the a. thaliana sro protein family consists of six members , atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> to atsro <dig>  based on a neighbour-joining tree using full length protein sequences, they formed distinct groups: atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> belong to group i while the others form group ii, which is further divided into two subgroups. atsro <dig> and atsro <dig> belong to group iia and atsro <dig> and atsro <dig> to group iib. atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> have an identical protein domain structure and belong to structural type a . hsparp <dig>  and a few other human parps possess similar domain structure with an n-terminal wwe domain and a parp domain as the structural type a sros, but lack the c-terminal rst domain. group ii sros  form the structural type b. the closest sequenced relative of a. thaliana, arabidopsis lyrata, possesses the same complement of sro proteins. orthologs from the two species clustered together in the phylogenetic trees based on the full length protein sequences  and the parp domain .

transcriptional regulation of the a. thaliana sros
three a. thaliana sros, atrcd <dig>  atsro <dig> and atsro <dig> have previously been functionally characterized. several studies suggest that the expression of atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> is developmentally regulated and only slightly stress responsive  <cit> , whereas atsro <dig> has previously been indicated as common stress response gene  <cit> . to probe transcriptional regulation of the atsro gene family, we mined publicly available affymetrix microarray chip data . these results confirmed that atsro <dig> was the transcriptionally most responsive member of the sro family . in order to verify and complement the microarray data, quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analyses indicated that atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> exhibited only subtle regulation in response to stress treatments . low variation in transcript abundance in response to stress conditions suggests that these proteins are regulated primarily at the post-translational level under our conditions. this is consistent with the observed low and tightly controlled amounts of rcd <dig> protein  <cit> . in contrast to our results, bechtold et al.  <cit>  reported a strong increase in atrcd <dig> transcript abundance in response to excess light stress. this difference is most likely due to the intensity and quality of the light used. atsro <dig>  atsro <dig> and atsro <dig> showed changes in transcript levels in response to light stress, salt treatment and exposure to o <dig> . atsro <dig> showed the clearest transcriptional responses to the stress treatments also in the qpcr analysis. no reproducible results were obtained for atsro <dig> but its presence in est databases suggests that it is expressed in plants. expression of the sro genes was analyzed by qpcr also in the rcd1- <dig> mutant. sro <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> exhibited higher transcript accumulation in rcd1- <dig>  suggesting that rcd <dig> acts as a negative regulator of these other gene family members. the effect could be indirect and due to the rcd <dig> mutant being primed for stress responses  <cit> .

the atsro <dig> gene forms a natural sirna pair with its neighbouring gene p5cdh in a. thaliana where they participate in a regulatory network during ros-mediated salt responses  <cit> . interestingly, in a. lyrata, grapevine, or poplar the p5cdh gene is not located next to the orthologs of atsro <dig> ; none of the atsro <dig> orthologs overlap with their respective neighbouring genes http://gbrowse.arabidopsis.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse_syn/arabidopsis/. this suggests that the system of p5cdh transcript regulation by natural sirna formation with sros is specific to a. thaliana. in order to address atsro <dig> gene function in transcriptional regulation, we performed microarray analysis of unstressed sro5- <dig> plants. the sro5- <dig> allele  used in our study carries a t-dna insertion in the second exon and expresses a truncated transcript  <cit> . microarray results revealed several genes with altered expression according to the fold-change ratio . however, these differences were not supported as significant by statistical analysis. to verify the array results with an independent method, we analyzed the expression of the genes with the clearest fold-changes by qpcr . similar to babajani et al.  <cit> , atsro <dig> itself had increased expression in the sro5- <dig> mutant . only one other gene, at3g <dig>  encoding qua-quine-starch  <cit> , exhibited reproducible changes of expression levels in the sro5- <dig> mutant. the expression of p5cdh, the atsro <dig> cis-antisense gene pair, was not altered according to our results and the study by babajani et al.  <cit> , suggesting that natural sirna formation might not be the primary regulatory mechanism in unstressed plants despite the elevated atsro <dig> transcript.

sro conservation and nomenclature in land plants
to better understand the structure of the sro protein family in plants, the a. thaliana protein sequences were used to identify and analyze the sequences of sros in several fully sequenced plant genomes . no sro protein orthologs were found in the sequenced genomes of algae or photosynthetic bacteria . because no sequence data or est information is available for any of the streptophyte algae, we cannot exclude the possibility that sros are present in this group. however, the sro family was present in all land plant genomes analyzed and showed considerable variation in its composition between plant species .

list of the species used in this analysis including their abbreviation , common name, phylogenetic classification , and sources of data used. analysis of all species utilized resources of the ncbi: national center for bioinformatics http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. additional web resources are listed below according to the abbreviations: pz, phytozome http://www.phytozome.net/); tair, the arabidopsis information resource http://www.arabidopsis.org/; jgi, joint genome initiative ; cvi, craig venter insititute http://castorbean.jcvi.org/; bdb, brachypodium database http://www.brachypodium.org/; rgadb, rice genome annotation database http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/; vgc , the french-italian public consortium for grapevine genome characterization http://www.cns.fr/spip/vitis-vinifera-e.html.

the lack of clear one-on-one orthology outside the brassicaceae  rendered naming conventions based on a. thaliana impractical for most plant species. therefore, a new unified nomenclature system is proposed . the key features of this system are: i) a. thaliana proteins retain their current names. ii) all rcd1/sro family members in other species are named sros and prefixed with a two letter abbreviation of the species scientific name. iii) all sros are assigned a number designation; i.e. all sro1s are in group i and sro2s in group ii. iv) multiple proteins within one group are then assigned an arbitrary letter designation in the order of their discovery to identify them individually. this nomenclature system allows the differentiation between group i and ii sros and will facilitate the comparison of related sros between species. all proteins used in this study have been named according to these conventions .

representation of sro groups and structural types in land plants
scanprosite  <cit>  and smart  <cit>  were used to identify conserved domains in the sro protein sequences. the catalytic core of the parp domain was the most consistently conserved feature of all identified sro proteins. therefore, the parp domains were used for the construction of a phylogenetic neighbour-joining tree . the tree was rooted using a. thaliana classical parp proteins  as an outgroup. atrcd1/alsro1a and also atsro1/alsro1b from both arabidopsis species grouped tightly and, along with sros from grapevine, poplar, castor bean, rice, and brachypodium distachyon, formed the subgroup ia. these proteins are of the structural type a containing wwe, parp, and rst domains . the second subgroup ib contains only proteins from the grasses rice and b. distachyon. this subgroup includes only structural type a proteins . the orthologs from the moss physcomitrella patens and the representative of basal vascular plants selaginella moellendorffi, together with sequences from castor bean, poplar, rice, and b. distachyon, formed the subgroup ic. these proteins retain the parp and rst domains while the wwe domain is only present in ptsro1c, ossro1c, and bdsro1c. of the group ic members in which no wwe domain was detected, only ppsro1c appears to be a full-length sequence .

the group iia  contains atsro <dig> and  <dig>  which grouped with their orthologs from a. lyrata . the other members of group ii are vvsro2a, rcsro2a, and a group of  <dig> closely related orthologs from poplar . the group iib  contains atsro <dig> and  <dig>  which clustered together with alsro2c and d; as well as vvsro2b, rcsro2b, and ptsro2e and f. the group ii  contains only sro members with domain structure of type b . strikingly, p. patens, s. moellendorffi, rice, and b. distachyon do not contain proteins that cluster together with group ii  suggesting that this group is specific for eudicots.

as described before, one to one orthology exists between the sros from arabidopsis species a. thaliana and a. lyrata, as evidenced by the tight clustering in cladograms, . in arabidopsis, sros were always present in pairs consistent with a previously proposed duplication event  from brassica rapa, brassica oleracea and brassica napus revealed the presence of distinguishable orthologs for atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> in brassica species . this suggests that the split between atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> might have occurred during the diversification of the brassicaceae, while other plant species retained so-called "co-orthologs" to atrcd1/atsro <dig>  <cit> . these refer to sister groups related equally to both proteins, which are derived from the expansion of paralogous genes in the individual species. the situation was similar for group iia; brassica contained ests which can be assigned as orthologous to either sro <dig> or  <dig> . in contrast, while brassica group iib orthologs were found for atsro <dig>  no sequences similar to atsro <dig> were found. however, it remains unclear if this indicates the absence of an atsro <dig> ortholog from brassica, or if this gene was simply missing from the current est collections due to low expression levels.

these results demonstrate the presence of group i sros with a conserved structure and domain architecture in all the genomes studied here and suggests their presence in all extant plant species, while group ii sros are unique to eudicot plants. intriguingly, both monocot species analyzed possess only group i sros. the lack of group ii in members of the more basal plant groups suggests that the origin of the sros lies within group i, and that group ii represents a later development. it is possible that the group ii evolved within eudicots only after the dicot-monocot split, or that at least some monocots, represented in this study by two grasses, have lost these groups after these plant lineages diverged more than  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . resolving this question will require investigation of further genomes especially species from the basal branches of angiosperms and gymnosperms, which are not currently available. several informative plant species, including loblolly pine  are currently being sequenced.

the conservation of the rst domain between plant groups
a novel conserved domain in the c-terminus of plant sros was identified recently  <cit> . this rst domain is also present in taf <dig> , which is a component of several multimeric protein complexes including primarily the general transcription factor tfiid involved in transcriptional initiation  <cit> . the rst domain is distinct from the conserved taf <dig> superfamily-defining domain , which is required for the assembly of the tfiid complex . here the analysis of the rst domain has been expanded, demonstrating that it is present in all known sro family members . in the few cases of sros without an rst domain, the gene annotation was questionable and requires further verification through mrna support for the gene model .

alignments of the c-terminus of sro family members from different plant species, representing all groups and subgroups, demonstrated that the rst domain is universally conserved . the sro group i was subdivided into three subgroups  based on the sequence of the parp domain  and analysis of the rst domains resulted in the same grouping . members of the groups ia and ib have an approximately  <dig> aa long extension in the n-terminus of the rst domain compared to the members of the groups ic and ii. since the group ib contains sros from p. patens together with sros from grasses and the eudicots castor bean and poplar, it might represent an ancestral sro group. a strong conservation of a large number of aliphatic aas in the n- and c- termini of the rst domain, with a strictly conserved tyrosine in the middle of the domain and two conserved positively charged aas in the second half of the domain, was striking . the strong conservation of aliphatic aas in the c-termini of the sro proteins points to a conserved alpha-helical structure. this sequence preservation implies strong functional constraints for the rst domain during the diversification of the sro protein family, possibly ensuring that a critical structure of the sro c-terminus is retained in spite of sequence divergence.

the functional domains of the a. thaliana sro proteins
the rst domain mediates transcription factor interactions
atrcd <dig> interacts with several transcription factors  in the yeast 2-hybrid system  and in vitro. the wwe and parp domains are dispensable for these interactions  <cit> . analysis of mutants lacking the rst domain of atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig> demonstrated the significance of this tf-interacting domain for plant development and stress responses. in contrast to atrcd <dig>  atsro <dig> only interacts with a subset of these tfs  <cit> . the c-terminus of atrcd <dig> is  <dig> aas longer than that of atsro <dig> and thus could account for its broader range of tf interactions. to further characterize the rcd1-tf interactions, we constructed c-terminal truncations of atrcd <dig> and tested them for interaction with dreb2a and col <dig> , two known atrcd <dig> interacting tfs  <cit> . deletion of the  <dig> aa extension did not affect the rcd1-tf interactions and also the next three aas  were dispensable. however, deletion of further nine or more aas , which extend into the conserved rst domain, disrupted interactions supporting the proposed role for rst as a functional protein interaction domain. aa d <dig> in atsro <dig> is absent from atrcd <dig> , and was thus another candidate for the observed differences in the interactions. however, deletion of this residue did not affect the atsro1-tf interactions . thus, the determinants of interaction specificity must lie in the other residues within the rst domain or elsewhere in the protein.

to address if the conserved sro5-rst domain is also a tf-interaction domain we screened the regia  collection  <cit>  with atsro <dig>  a group iib sro, which has been shown to be involved in salt stress responses  <cit> . atsro <dig> interacted with  <dig> tfs out of the more than  <dig> present in the collection . three tfs belong to the ap2/erf tf family and two to the nam/nac and bhlh families each. five of these tfs interact also with atrcd <dig>  and dreb2a with both atrcd <dig> and atsro <dig>  <cit> . in addition, atsro <dig> interacted with  <dig> proteins that were not recovered with full-length atrcd <dig> but interacted with a truncated version, which lacks the wwe domain , thus resembling the atsro <dig> domain structure. three tfs  were unique interaction partners for atsro <dig>  although atrcd <dig> interacted with other members of the same tf families  <cit> . atsro <dig> was previously reported to localize to mitochondria  <cit> . however, bioinformatic prediction of its subcellular localization rather suggested a different targeting of the protein. this, together with the multiple tf interactions of atsro <dig> prompted us to investigate the cellular distribution of the atsro <dig> protein.

ectopic expression of atsro5-gfp in a. thaliana seedlings showed that atsro <dig> localized to several dot-like structures in the nucleus . the results were verified by transient expression of the same construct in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the difference in the observed subcellular localization could be due to the use of different expressions systems. thus we cannot exclude that atsro <dig> localizes to mitochondria under certain conditions.

these results give possible biological relevance to the interactions between atsro <dig> and tfs. constant communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is required for normal cellular function  <cit> . atsro <dig> might participate in bidirectional interorganellar signaling and play a role in regulating nuclear gene expression through the tf interactions. however, the implications of atsro <dig> localization to other cellular compartments in addition to the mitochondria require further studies to reveal its significance.

the high number of tf interactions in the y2h screen demonstrates functional conservation of the rst domain and its importance for protein-protein interaction . the rst domain is also present in plant taf <dig> proteins. human and drosophila taf4s have an n-terminal extension carrying the eto-tafh domain . this domain recruits various transcription factors to the tfiid initiation complex and thereby participates in the regulation of transcription  <cit> . the eto-tafh domain is missing from plant taf <dig> proteins; instead, the taf <dig> n-terminus bears the rst domain . its presence and position in relation to other domains suggests that the rst domain could be functionally equivalent to other, animal specific, tf-interaction domains. strong conservation between the rst domains from taf <dig> and the sros could hint towards a common function of tf binding. tf recruitment to tfiid by taf <dig> rst is a paradigm for transcriptional regulation. competition for, or modification of, common tf interaction partners is a model for the modulation of taf <dig> dependent processes by the sros. the future challenge will be to resolve the structure of several highly similar rst domains including atrcd <dig>  atsro <dig>  atsro <dig> and also taf4s. this together with mutagenesis and deletion studies based on the comparisons  will help to understand the basis of the specificity of the tf interactions. in planta verification of the interactions and competition experiments between sros, tfs, and taf4s will be required to determine the significance of the protein-protein interactions.

the conserved parp domain in sro-proteins: structural vs. functional conservation
based on the presence of a parp catalytic domain, it has been presumed that a. thaliana rcd <dig> and sro proteins could have adp-ribosyl transferase activity  <cit> , which seems to be confirmed by the conserved fold structure . the alignment of atparps and atrcd <dig> with hsparp <dig>  for which the 3d structure has been solved, allowed for identification of conserved fold structures as landmarks in a. thaliana parps . generally, the fold structure is well conserved and all of the folds that constitute the active site are present . some additional plant specific folds not present in the hsparp <dig> are predicted in atparp <dig> and  <dig>  atrcd <dig> and atsros . these additional predicted features, if present, apparently do not disrupt the activity in atparp <dig>  which was shown to exhibit parp activity . the conserved active site folds also mark the position of the catalytic triad, the three aas histidine , tyrosine  and glutamic acid , which is conserved in atparp <dig> and  <dig> but not atrcd <dig> or atsros . the h <dig> to l and y <dig> to h substitutions at the nad binding sites within the hye catalytic triad of rcd <dig>  suggest that it has lost the ability to bind nad.

 relationship between conserved aa motif of the adp-ribosyl transferase catalytic triad, the loop length between Î²-sheets  <dig> and  <dig>  and predicted or know catalytic activity of selected a. thaliana and human parps and sro family members. presence or absence of the wwe domain  and catalytic activities are indicated. results of this study are marked with an asterisk .

to test the predictions of activity based on the fold structure of the parp domain, we expressed the a. thaliana full length rcd <dig> protein and a truncated form containing the parp and rst domains  as gst-tagged proteins in escherichia coli. the recombinant proteins were partially purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione sepharose and used for testing nad binding. pisum sativum short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase-like protein a  was used as positive control.

nad binding was investigated by covalent cross-linking of bound nad by ultraviolet irradiation  <cit> . after uv irradiation of sample mixtures containing radioactive nad and the proteins tested, the proteins were separated by sds-page and labeling with  was monitored by autoradiography. to verify the specificity of nad binding, competition experiments were performed with excess of unlabeled nad.

the nad binding of the positive control, sad-a, was visible as two bands in an autoradiogram . the major band at  <dig> kda corresponds to monomeric form of the enzyme, and the minor band at  <dig> kda to the dimer  <cit> . the presence of 1000-fold excess of unlabeled nad resulted in the disappearance of both bands, indicating that the nad binding was specific . in contrast, rcd1-gst, pct-gst and gst did not bind nad . the weak bands visible on the autoradiogram at the molecular weights corresponding to rcd1-gst or pct-gst  or gst alone, respectively, did not disappear in presence of unlabeled nad, indicating unspecific labeling of the proteins. the  <dig> kda band visible in the autoradiogram  represented a contaminant in the purified rcd1-gst and pct-gst samples. it was identified by mass spectrometry as dnak molecular chaperone from e. coli. dnak protein contains a nucleotide-binding domain explaining its ability to bind nad.

these results demonstrated that atrcd <dig> does not bind nad and thus should not have art activity. to verify this, we tested possible poly transferase activity of rcd1-gst and pct-gst directly in a standard art activity assay using recombinant hsparp <dig> as a positive control. hsparp <dig> exhibited automodification  but no auto-poly transferase activity was detected for rcd1-gst or pct-gst . possible substrate modification by rcd1-gst or pct-gst was analyzed by supplementing the reaction mixture with histones, which are classical parp targets. neither rcd1-gst nor pct-gst exhibited detectable parp or mart activity . additionally, dreb2a, the most prominent rcd <dig> interaction partner, could be a possible substrate  <cit> . however, no parp or mart activity of rcd1-gst or pct-gst towards dreb2a-gst was detected .

in light of these results, it is remarkable that the sros structurally resemble parps/arts so closely. it may be possible that the parp domain of atrcd <dig> and the sros still has an activity related to adp-ribosylation. a novel mechanism has been described for hsparp <dig>  which lacks the catalytic glutamic acid , the third conserved aa of the catalytic triad . hsparp <dig> has still retained mart activity via a novel mechanism in which the active e is provided by the substrate protein  <cit> . hsparp <dig> has a shorter linker sequence between folds Î² <dig> and Î² <dig>  <cit>  which facilitates an open active site configuration necessary for the substrate glutamic acid entry into the active site. atparps  retain a long Î²4-Î² <dig> linker but all atsros have the shorter linker  suggesting a more open active site fold. the bioinformatic analysis revealed the loss of both conserved nad contacting h and y in the a. thaliana sro parp domains making such a substrate-mediated mart activity unlikely . this is supported by our biochemical analysis which demonstrated that atrcd <dig> is not able to bind nad, and, consequently, does not have mart or parp activity. other similar changes in the catalytic triad of the other atsros suggest they too may lack the capacity for nad binding and art activity . interestingly, this is also true for active sites in sros from other plant species , with the notable exception of p. patens sros, which bear more conserved and potentially active catalytic triads.

CONCLUSIONS
the sros are a protein family with a unique domain architecture which is conserved in all land plants. the sro proteins can be subdivided into two groups representing two different structural types. different plant groups have experienced expansion of different sro groups during evolution. interestingly, the basal plant groups, p. patens, a moss, and s. moellendorffi, a lycopodiopsid, as well as monocots possess only group i sros, while eudicots additionally contain group ii sros. our analysis suggests that the evolutionary origin of the sros lies within subgroup ib, which could be ancestral to all other sros. alternatively, monocots and more basal vascular plants might have experienced a secondary loss of group ii sros.

while the n-terminal wwe domain is only present in group i sros of the structural type a, virtually all sros analyzed contain a parp-like domain and a c-terminal rst domain . the conservation of the c-terminus of the sros suggests functional constraints and a subsequent requirement for the conservation of a particular structure . a possible function is the interaction with transcription factors , which has been demonstrated for several a. thaliana sros, including atsro <dig>  for a protein localized to mitochondria  <cit> , its ability to interact with several transcription factors in y2h analysis was unexpected. our analysis of subcellular localization for atsro <dig> showed that the protein is localized to several dot-like structures in the nucleus  which supports the significance of the tf interactions. nevertheless, it is possible that atsro <dig> localizes to the mitochondria under certain conditions linking tf interactions to retrograde signaling and mitochondrial metabolism  <cit> .

the parp-like domain is the most conserved feature of the sros. however, based on bioinformatic and biochemical evidence , we suggest that the sros do not possess parp or mart activity. nevertheless, the fold structure of the parp-like domain is highly conserved . as a comparison, it is estimated, that 10% of the receptor-like protein kinases encoded in the a. thaliana genome are inactive but nevertheless expressed and translated and potentially function as co-receptors  <cit> . what other possible function or activity might those parp/art-like domains possess? the structural conservation of an enzymatically inactive domain could facilitate complex formation or stabilization and be an advantage for the organism. regardless of which activity is eventually discovered in the sros, they have important functions in plant stress responses and in development.
