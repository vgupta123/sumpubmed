BACKGROUND
the introduction of general anesthetics into medical practice  <dig> years ago has revolutionized surgical practice, however, the mechanisms of action of this class of drugs are still only poorly understood. although general anesthetics have been shown to modulate the activity of a number of proteins, e.g. ligand-gated ion channels  <cit>  and two-pore domain potassium channels  <cit> in vitro, the identification of targets mediating specific actions of general anesthetics in vivo has only just begun.

gabaa receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, with the majority of them containing two α, two β and one γ subunit  <cit> . mutagenesis studies have identified amino acid residues in gabaa receptor β subunits  to be crucial for the actions of the general anesthetics propofol and etomidate in vitro  <cit> .

it has been shown that β <dig> mice are insensitive to the immobilizing and respiratory depressant action of etomidate and propofol and have a reduced sensitivity for the hypnotic action of these drugs  <cit> , suggesting that β3-containing gabaa receptors mediate these actions, while etomidate retains its sedative  action at subanesthetic doses. in line with these findings, β <dig> mice are still sensitive to the immobilizing and hypnotic actions of etomidate, but lack the sedative response to low doses of etomidate  <cit> .

inhalation anesthetics like isoflurane show a wider range of targets in vitro, including the gabaa receptor, glycine receptor, 5-ht <dig> receptor, kainate receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, ampa receptor, and nmda receptor  <cit> . it was recently shown that the inhalational anesthetics isoflurane, enflurane and halothane exert their immobilizing action only partly via β3-containing gabaa receptors  <cit> , suggesting that other targets of these volatile anesthetics mediate most of their immobilizing action. the extinction of the conditioned fear response by isoflurane, which is related to the amnestic action of isoflurane, on the other hand, has been suggested to be mediated by cortical α1-containing gabaa receptors  <cit> , which are frequently associated with β <dig> subunits  <cit> .

in this study, we assessed the effects of isoflurane on heart rate, core body temperature and the ecg, the anterograde amnesic action of propofol, and the effects of propofol and etomidate on the ecg. we further assessed the immobilizing and hypnotic action of etomidate and propofol in mice carrying the β <dig> mutation on congenic c57bl/6j and 129x1/svj backgrounds to confirm the phenotype of the β <dig> mutation on two additional genetic backgrounds.

RESULTS
the heart rate depressant effect of isoflurane is present but reduced in β <dig> mice
it has previously been shown that the immobilizing action of isoflurane is mediated only in part by β3-containing gabaa receptors  <cit> . we now investigated whether the heart rate depressant action of isoflurane is dependent on β3-containing gabaa receptors. we chose a concentration of  <dig> % isoflurane, which represents approximately  <dig>  "mac" in wild type mice and  <dig>  "mac" in β <dig> mice with respect to the loss of the hindlimb withdrawal reflex  <cit> . after application of  <dig> % isoflurane for  <dig> min, the heart rate of wild type mice decreased from a baseline value of  <dig> ±  <dig> bpm to  <dig> ±  <dig> bpm after  <dig> min of isoflurane application , whereas in β <dig> mice it decreased from a baseline value of  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig> bpm   . the time course of heart rate decrease is similar in wild type and β <dig> mice. the decrease of the heart rate after isoflurane is significantly smaller in β <dig> mice compared to wild type mice under these experimental conditions , however, the difference is rather small and thus the heart rate depressant action of isoflurane is largely mediated by targets other than β3-containing gabaa receptors. alphaxalone, whose action is not affected by the point mutation  <cit> , and which was used as a negative control, displayed no genotype difference with respect to heart rate depression  <cit> , indicating that the heart rate depressant action as such is not affected by the point mutation.

the hypothermic effect of isoflurane is present but reduced in β <dig> mice
isoflurane decreases the core body temperature . when mice are placed in a chamber with  <dig> % isoflurane , the cbt starts to decrease within  <dig> minutes. the cbt decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c and  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c to  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c   after  <dig> min of isoflurane application in wild type and mutant mice, respectively  . the time course of hypothermia is similar in wild type and β <dig> mice. immediately after the mouse is taken out of the isoflurane chamber, the cbt increases again. the decrease of cbt in the presence of isoflurane is pronounced in both genotypes although slightly but significantly smaller in β <dig> mice, indicating a minor role for the β3-containing gabaa receptors in this drug action. the hypothermic response to alphaxalone was not different between β <dig> and wild type mice, indicating that β <dig> mice respond properly to a hypothermic challenge.

effects of isoflurane on ecg parameters
general anesthetics are known to alter ecg parameters in humans. in mice, ecg changes have only been recorded for ketamine. we determined the effects of isoflurane on the ecg in wild type and β <dig> mice . in wild type mice, isoflurane increased heart rate variability, the pq, qt, and qrs intervals. there was no genotype difference in these parameters, suggesting no role of β3-containing gabaa receptors in the effects of isoflurane on these ecg parameters. there were also no genotype differences after alphaxalone, indicating an unaltered responsiveness of β <dig> mice to changes in the ecg.

all values are mean ± sem. rr inter-beat-interval. group sizes: isoflurane: wt n =  <dig>  β <dig> n = 7; alphaxalone i.v.: wt n =  <dig>  β <dig> n =  <dig>  * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , compared to baseline.

β <dig> mice on different genetic backgrounds show similar response to propofol and etomidate
in view of extensive literature on the influence of genetic background in genetically modified mice, we checked whether the response of β <dig> mice to general anesthetics is influenced by this. all experiments done in these mice published so far  <cit>  and all experiments presented so far in this communication were done with mice harbouring the β <dig> point mutation on a mixed background of 129x1/sv × 129/svj. to test whether the genetic background influences the response to etomidate- and propofol-induced loss of righting reflex  and loss of hindlimb withdrawal reflex , these mice were backcrossed  <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively, either to c57/bl/6j or 129x1/svj wild type mice, to obtain the mutation on a congenic background. these mice were tested with etomidate  and propofol  . after injection of etomidate lorr was  <dig> ±  <dig> min and  <dig> ±  <dig> min, in the c57bl/6j wild type and 129x1/svj wild type mice, respectively. the duration of lhwr was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min in c57bl/6j and 129x1/svj wild type mice, respectively. similar to what was previously observed in the mixed background 129/sv × 129/svj β <dig> mice  <cit> , also in β <dig> mice on the c57bl/6j and 129x1/svj backgrounds,  <dig> mg/kg etomidate lead to a significantly decreased lorr  and to an abolished lhwr . thus, we have observed the same phenotype in three different backgrounds, suggesting that it is robust across different genetic backgrounds.

propofol induces anterograde amnesia in β <dig> mice
general anesthetics are known to induce anterograde amnesia. we tested whether propofol-induced anterograde amnesia is mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors. increasing doses of propofol  were employed . the increasing imprint latency on the training day at the two highest doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg propofol might indicate that in both genotypes mice are slightly sedated at these doses. most importantly, propofol decreased retrieval, i.e. the latency to re-enter the dark compartment, to a similar degree in wild type and β <dig> mice. anova indicated a difference between the drug doses , but no genotype effect . these results indicate that propofol produces anterograde amnesia in both wild-type and β <dig> mice and thus by targets independent of β3-containing gabaa receptors.

effects of etomidate and propofol on ecg parameters
when applying etomidate and propofol via the i.v. route and the i.p. route, we observed a strong decrease in heart rate  and a prolongation of all time domain parameters measured . the heart rate variability  increases  <dig>  to 8-fold  in wild type mice and  <dig> to 5-fold in β <dig> mice . the hrv in β <dig> mice after injection of etomidate  <dig> mg/kg i.v. is significantly smaller than hrv in wild type mice after etomidate  <dig> mg/kg i.v. . no genotype differences in hrv were noted for all other drug applications. qt, qrs and pq intervals are prolonged in wild type mice and β <dig> mice after injection of etomidate and propofol i.v. and i.p.. there is no genotype effect after injection of any anesthetic for any interval. in summary, as mentioned previously for isoflurane, etomidate and propofol induce changes in ecg parameters, which are largely independent of β3-containing gabaa receptors.

all values are mean ± sem.. group sizes: propofol i.v.: wt n =  <dig>  β <dig> n =  <dig>  etomidate i.v.: wt n =  <dig>  β <dig> n =  <dig>  alphaxalone i.v.: wt n =  <dig>  β <dig> n =  <dig>  propofol i.p.: wt n =  <dig>  β <dig> n =  <dig>  etomidate i.p.: wt n =  <dig>  β <dig> n =  <dig>  * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig>  compared to baseline, # p <  <dig>  wild type compared to β <dig> mice. treatment with all different vehicles alone did not lead to statistically significant changes of the ecg parameters recorded compared to baseline. statistical comparison of drug values with vehicle values and of drug values with baseline values yields similar results.

discussion
in this report, we investigated the contribution of β3-containing gabaa receptors to various physiological and behavioural endpoints of the inhalational general anesthetic isoflurane and the intravenous general anesthetics propofol and etomidate. we show that the hypothermic and cardiac depressant actions of isoflurane are to a small but significant degree mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors, and that the anterograde amnestic action of propofol is not mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors. we also found that the resistance of the β <dig> mice to the immobilizing action of etomidate and propofol and their partial resistance to the hypnotic action of etomidate and propofol are present on a total of three different genetic backgrounds.

we studied the effects of general anesthetics in mice harbouring an asparagine to methionine point mutation in position  <dig> of the β <dig> subunit of the gabaa receptor. this point mutation renders β3-containing gabaa receptors insensitive to the general anesthetics propofol and etomidate, but not to alphaxalone in a recombinant system  <cit> . the action of the volatile anesthetic enflurane is also strongly reduced by the n265m point mutation in a recombinant system  <cit> . in addition, an in vivo increase of the ec <dig> values for enflurane, halothane and isoflurane by 16%, 21%, and 24% has been reported for their immobilizing action in β <dig> mice  <cit> . in β <dig> mice the suppression of noxious-evoked movements by etomidate and propofol, as measured by the loss of the hindlimb withdrawal reflex was completely abolished and the obtunding or hypnotic response, as determined by the loss of the righting reflex, was also decreased significantly  <cit> . in addition, the respiratory depressant action of propofol and etomidate was strongly reduced in the β <dig> mice  <cit> . the β <dig> mice also display a slightly reduced hypothermia in response to etomidate, but not to propofol  <cit> .

it was previously shown that isoflurane induces lorr and lhwr largely via targets other than β3-containing gabaa receptors, although these receptors play an appreciable role in mediating lhwr  <cit> . in this study, we report that core body temperature and heart rate changes in response to isoflurane are also partly mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors, although other targets mediate a much larger part of these responses. the decrease in the heart rate may be secondary to the decrease in body temperature and thus represent a dependent and not an independent parameter. in humans, isoflurane decreases blood pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance while increasing heart rate  <cit> . isoflurane depresses both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, but the hypotension leads to a reflex increase in sympathetic tone, so that isoflurane depresses the parasympathetic nervous system more than the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in tachycardia. increases in the plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine have been found  <cit> , indicating activation of the sympathetic nervous system. our observation in mice that isoflurane decreases the heart rate might indicate a species difference in the cardiovascular responses to this drug.

we have reported previously that the intravenous general anesthetics etomidate and propofol reduce heart rate in mice  <cit> . in humans, etomidate and propofol slightly increase the heart rate  <cit> . in mice,  <dig> mg/kg etomidate i.v. induces an immediate decrease of both heart rate and core body temperature. the lowest heart rate was observed after  <dig> minutes, whereas the lowest core body temperature was observed after  <dig> minutes. at the lowest heart rate, the temperature drop was 4°c, whereas the maximal temperature drop was 5°c  <cit> . thus, at a point when the heart rate already starts to recover, the core body temperature is still decreasing.

the time course of heart rate and core body temperature after  <dig> % isoflurane presented in this study also shows that the minimal heart rate is reached first, after  <dig> minutes, and the minimal temperature after  <dig> minutes. after  <dig> minutes, the temperature drop was  <dig> °c, whereas the maximal temperature drop after  <dig> minutes was  <dig> °c. the heart rate appears to recover before the core body temperature has reached its lowest point, and notably, the heart rate increased before the isoflurane application was stopped, whereas the body temperature only increased after the end of isoflurane application. thus, for both the intravenous anesthetic etomidate and the volatile anesthetic isoflurane, significant hypothermia develops before the peak drug effects on heart rate are reached, and the time courses of recovery of cardiac depression and hypothermia are different.

our current and previous studies do not address the question whether heart rate depression and hypothermia are dependent or independent variables, which would require "clamping" of the core body temperature during application of anesthetics. both the drop in heart rate and the drop in core body temperature both in response to etomidate  <cit>  and isoflurane are largely dependent on targets other than β3-containing gabaa receptors and only to a minor degree by β3-containing gabaa receptors. the slightly different time course of hypothermia and bradycardia for both etomidate and isoflurane might suggest that these parameters might be at least in part independent. interestingly, there is no genotype difference between β <dig> mice and wild type mice the for drop in heart rate and the drop in core body temperature after alphaxalone/alphadolone  <cit> , which is not affected by the point mutation, indicating that the β <dig> display a normal response to an anesthetic challenge. since mice are small animals, their ratio of body surface to body mass is relatively high and thus hypothermia is expected to be more pronounced than in humans with comparable challenges. it should be noted that the clear species differences especially with respect to changes in heart rate suggest that extrapolation of mouse data to humans should be done with great caution.

general anesthetic agents also alter electrocardiographic  intervals and decrease heart rate variability in humans as was shown for induction with the barbiturate thiopentone and subsequent inhalation of isoflurane-nitrous oxide  <cit> . here, we report that heart rate variability  is increased by general anesthetics in mice. hrv is considered to be an indicator of cardiac vagal control, and drugs increasing hrv have been shown to reduce mortality and sudden death in severe heart failure in clinical trials  <cit> . our finding might indicate that general anesthetics reduces sympathetic tone in mice  <cit>  which results in prolongation of time domain intervals such as qt, qrs and pq and in an increase in hrv. we showed an increase of hrv after all anesthetics tested, but most pronounced in wild type mice after application of etomidate i.v.. the increase in hrv after etomidate is slightly but significantly reduced in β <dig> compared to wild type mice. prolongation of qt, qrs and pq intervals is similar in β <dig> and wild type mice. to our knowledge, no central mechanisms of hrv regulation have been investigated in mice. in the periphery, β-adrenergic receptors expressed in cardiac tissue are thought to regulate hrv  <cit> . β <dig> and β2-ars play differential roles in the modulation of hrv, each receptor subtype regulating different frequency components of hrv  <cit> . etomidate is also known to have agonist activity at α <dig> adrenergic receptors  <cit> , and it is conceivable that some of its effects on heart rate variability are mediated by these receptors. β3-containing gabaa receptors might play a role in the central regulation of hrv. in general, it should be kept in mind that the ecg in the mouse, as performed in this study, is recorded from only two electrodes and information is thus much more limited than information obtained from ecg in humans.

based on differential sensitivities to propofol of inbred long sleep  and inbred short sleep  mice, it has been postulated that a gene responsible for the lorr induced by propofol, termed lorp <dig>  would be located in a 99% confidence interval from  <dig> – <dig>  mb on mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , and in addition, an etomidate-sensitivity quantitative trait locus  has also been identified in this chromosome region  <cit> . so far, the identity of the lorp <dig> gene is unknown. interestingly, the gabrb <dig> gene encoding the β <dig> subunit of the gabaa receptor is also located on mouse chromosome  <dig>  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. to ascertain that the phenotype previously described in 129/sv × 129/svj mice, i.e. partial loss of lorr and complete loss of lhwr in response to etomidate and propofol in β <dig> mice  <cit>  is really due to the point mutation in the gabaa receptor β <dig> subunit, the mutant mice were bred for  <dig> and  <dig> generations, respectively, onto the 129x1/svj and c57bl/6j backgrounds, to yield congenic mice. in all backgrounds examined, we observed the same phenotype, demonstrating that this phenotype is very robust across different backgrounds, and thus that the observed phenotype is really associated with the n265m point mutation in the gabrb <dig> gene. thus, our analysis shows that gabrb <dig> and lorp <dig> are separate genes.

we further tested β <dig> mice on the congenic 129x1/svj background in the passive avoidance paradigm, to examine whether the anterograde amnesic action of propofol would be mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors. our results suggest that this anesthetic endpoint is independent of β3-containing gabaa receptors. this result is consistent with previous findings that both the anterograde amnesic action of diazepam  <cit>   as well as the anterograde amnesic action of isoflurane   <cit>  are mediated by α1-containing gabaa receptors. since α1β2γ <dig> is the most abundant gabaa receptor subtype  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate, and consistent with all data currently available, that this receptor subtype mediates the anterograde amnesic actions not only of sedative-hypnotic agents like diazepam , but also of general anesthetic agents. however, in α5-/- mice, long term potentiation  in ca <dig> is reduced by etomidate in wild type but not in α5-/- mice  <cit> . furthermore, learning in the morris water maze and in fear conditioning is impaired by etomidate in wild type mice, but not in α5-/- mice  <cit> . these data indicate a role for α5-containing gabaa receptors in drug-induced amnesia, in addition to its involvement in certain hippocampus-dependent forms of associative learning like trace fear conditioning  <cit> .

our current knowledge on the role of β3-containing gabaa receptors in the action of the general anesthetics etomidate, propofol and isoflurane is summarized in table  <dig>  the genetic dissection of the pharmacological spectrum of general anesthetics is of interest for the design of novel general anesthetic compounds, in which the various desired and undesired effects can be separated.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that β3-containing gabaa receptors mediate a small, but significant, part of isoflurane-induced heart rate depression and hypothermia, which is in line with the small but significant contribution of β3-containing gabaa receptors to isoflurane-induced immobility and hypnosis reported previously. we also found that isoflurane-induced ecg changes are not mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors. these data indicate that isoflurane exerts its effects via many targets, β3-containing gabaa receptors being one of them. furthermore, we found a dissociation between the immobilizing and anterograde amnestic action of propofol. whereas as previously shown the immobilizing action of etomidate is mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors, the anterograde amnesic action is independent of this receptor subtype. prolongation of ecg intervals induced by etomidate and propofol was not mediated by β3-containing gabaa receptors. by demonstrating that etomidate- and propofol-induced immobilization is mediated exclusively and hypnosis is mediated partly by β3-containing gabaa receptors in two congenic backgrounds, we show that this phenotype is robust across three backgrounds and that the gabrb <dig> locus is different from the lorp <dig> locus.
