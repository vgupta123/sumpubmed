BACKGROUND
mammals have two types of fat, white and brown adipose tissue , that carry out essentially opposite functions in whole body energy metabolism  <cit> . white adipocytes are specialized in energy storage and their content of triglyceride constitutes the largest energy reserve of the body. contrary, brown adipocytes have a high capacity for energy dissipation through adaptive thermogenesis due to the presence of the brown adipocyte-specific uncoupling protein  <dig>  in the inner membrane of the abundant mitochondria. bat has been shown to counteract obesity and is important for rodents to defend their body temperature in response to prolonged cold exposure  <cit> . brown-like adipocytes expressing ucp <dig> appear in some rodent wat depots after cold exposure or treatment with β-adrenergic agonists  <cit> . recent studies have suggested a negative correlation between body mass index and the amount of active bat in humans  <cit> . strategies aiming at increasing levels of ucp <dig> in wat have become of interest as reduced expression of brown adipocyte-enriched genes in wat is associated with obesity and type  <dig> diabetes in humans  <cit> .

retinoic acid  is a derivative of vitamin a that affects cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis in various embryonic and adult tissues  <cit> . all-trans ra  has been reported being an agonist for multiple nuclear receptors, including ra receptors   <cit> , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ   <cit> , testicular orphan receptor  <dig>   <cit>  and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor ii   <cit> . it has been proposed that pparδ mediates part of the metabolic effects of atra  <cit> . additionally, atra has been shown to regulate gene expression in a nongenomic manner  <cit> . however, it is believed that most effects of atra are mediated by rars that upon heterodimerization with retinoid x receptors control gene expression through binding to ra response elements in regulatory regions of target genes  <cit> .

high concentrations of atra inhibit differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> white preadipocytes and c3h10t½ mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> , whereas low concentrations have been shown to stimulate white adipogenesis of ob <dig> cells  <cit> . the inhibition of adipogenesis by atra is mediated by rars and is linked to suppression of ccaat/enhancer-binding protein β activity and induction of anti-adipogenic genes  <cit> .

the ucp <dig> gene of mice, rats and humans contains rar-responsive elements in its enhancer region and atra has been shown to promote ucp <dig> expression and oxidative metabolism in cultured rodent adipocytes  <cit> . moreover, treatment of mice with atra causes increased expression of ucp <dig> in wat and bat  <cit> .

in the present study we compared the response of mouse and human preadipocytes and mature adipocytes to atra, with emphasis on the effects on differentiation and ucp <dig> expression. in addition, we have studied the importance of rars, pparδ and pgc-1α for the regulation of ucp <dig> expression by atra. we find that atra increases ucp <dig> expression in all mouse adipocyte models studied, including 3t3-l <dig> white adipocytes, and that this induction is mediated by rars and is independent of pparδ and pgc-1α. finally, atra does not increase ucp <dig> expression in any of the human adipocytes examined in this study.

RESULTS
exposure of differentiating mouse adipocytes to atra increases ucp <dig> expression
in order to examine the effects of atra on differentiating mouse adipocytes, we exposed four cell models of adipogenesis to a range of atra concentrations  throughout the course of the differentiation process, i.e. between days − <dig>  and  <dig> . gene expression was analyzed at day  <dig>  we estimated the degree of differentiation by measuring mrna levels of the adipocyte marker gene fatty acid-binding protein  <dig> . expression of the brown fat-specific ucp <dig> gene was determined at both the mrna and protein levels, and the expression of rarβ was used to estimate the degree of activation of rars, as the rarβ gene is responsive to retinoids  <cit> . the cells used were 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes, wild-type  mouse embryo fibroblasts  and the mesenchymal stem cell line c3h10t½ as models of white adipocyte differentiation  <cit> , and mefs lacking a functional retinoblastoma gene  as a model of brown adipocyte differentiation  <cit> .

rarβ expression increased dose-dependently in response to treatment with atra in 3t3-l <dig>  wt mefs and c3h10t½ cells, whereas the same pattern was not observed in rb−/− mefs . a dose-dependent reduction of fabp <dig> expression was seen in wt mefs, c3h10t½ and rb−/− mefs, whereas only the highest level of atra  blocked adipose conversion of 3t3-l <dig> cells . atra in intermediate concentrations  induced expression of ucp <dig> at both mrna and protein levels, with a maximum fold induction of mrna levels of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in 3t3-l <dig>  wt mef-derived, c3h10t½ and rb−/− mef-derived adipocytes, respectively . although atra in intermediate concentrations induced expression of ucp <dig> in all cases, the absolute level of ucp <dig> varied substantially between the cell models, being highest in rb−/− adipocytes and lowest in wt mef-derived adipocytes. in summary, chronic exposure to high concentrations of atra inhibits adipocyte differentiation, whereas intermediate concentrations cause increased expression of ucp <dig>  even in 3t3-l <dig> white adipocytes.

exposing mature mouse adipocytes to atra enhances expression of ucp1
in addition to the chronic exposure to atra described above, we also analyzed the effects of exposing mature mouse adipocytes to atra at day  <dig> . in this case, we used a fixed concentration of atra  and harvested rna and protein after 24 h . expression of ucp <dig> and rarβ increased in response to atra compared to vehicle in wt and rb−/− mef-derived and c3h10t½ adipocytes, but not in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes, with ucp <dig> mrna levels increasing 15-,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, in the former three cell models . levels of ucp <dig> protein mirrored the levels of ucp <dig> mrna . fabp <dig> mrna levels were slightly reduced by the acute exposure to atra in mef-derived adipocytes, but not in 3t3-l <dig> and c3h10t½ adipocytes.

rars mediate the effects of atra
as atra has been shown to bind and activate a range of nuclear receptors, we wished to identify the relevant targets of atra mediating the effects observed above. therefore, we treated wt mefs with ttnpb, a pan-rar agonist not displaying agonist activity toward pparδ  <cit> , using the two same experimental setups described above. both chronic application of ttnpb  and acute application of ttnpb to mature adipocytes  resulted in expression patterns of fabp <dig>  ucp <dig> and rarβ similar to those observed upon treatment with atra . expression levels of ucp <dig> reached a peak induction of 25-fold in chronically treated adipocytes   and 6-fold after treatment of mature adipocytes with 1 nm ttnpb for 24 h . next, we investigated if the pan-rar antagonist bms <dig> could inhibit the ucp1-inducing effects of atra. when applied chronically during differentiation  and acutely to mature adipocytes , bms <dig> eliminated and blunted, respectively, the enhanced expression of ucp <dig> caused by atra. these results strongly suggest that the action of atra is mediated through rars.

to delineate which of the three rar isoforms that are responsible for the upregulation of ucp <dig>  we used three rar subtype-selective agonists: am <dig> ; tazarotene  and cd <dig> . all three agonists caused an induction of ucp <dig> expression when administered chronically to differentiating wt mefs . am <dig> and tazarotene induced the highest fold increase in ucp <dig> expression . a dose-dependent increase in rarβ mrna and a reduction of fabp <dig> mrna levels were observed for all three agonists . notably, as am <dig> has a 30-40-fold selectivity for rarα compared to rarβ and rarγ  <cit> , the observation that 10 nm am <dig> was sufficient to increase ucp <dig> levels suggests that activation of rarα is sufficient . however, tazarotene and cd <dig> were also able to increase ucp <dig> levels despite a low affinity for rarα, indicating that activation of any rar subtype is capable of increasing ucp <dig> expression in mouse adipocytes.

when the three agonists were acutely supplemented to mature wt mef-derived adipocytes, ucp <dig> mrna levels were significantly induced after 24 h, with am <dig> and tazarotene displaying the most potent effect .

pparδ activation does not increase ucp <dig> expression in mef-derived white adipocytes
as mentioned, atra can bind to pparδ and increase its transcriptional activity  <cit> , and activation of pparδ is believed to regulate thermogenic gene expression in adipose tissue  <cit> . to determine if activation of pparδ mimics the effects observed with atra, we exposed wt mefs to the pparδ agonist gw <dig> either during differentiation  or acutely to mature adipocytes . gw <dig> did not change either ucp <dig> or fabp <dig> mrna levels in either case . the pparδ target gene adipose differentiation-related protein   <cit>  was significantly upregulated when gw <dig> was added chronically .

the effects of atra on ucp <dig> expression is not dependent on pgc-1α
pgc-1α is a metabolically regulated transcriptional coactivator that is known to induce ucp <dig> levels in adipocytes and to interact with rarα in an atra-dependent manner  <cit> . to investigate whether pgc-1α is required for the atra-mediated effects, we compared immortalized brown preadipocyte cell lines from wt and pgc-1α-deficient mice  <cit> . atra was supplemented either chronically during differentiation or acutely to mature adipocytes. ucp <dig> expression was increased at intermediate concentrations of atra in the chronically treated pgc-1α+/+ and pgc-1α−/− adipocytes . the highest level of ucp <dig> was observed with  <dig>  μm atra in wt adipocytes , but with 1 μm atra in pgc-1α−/− adipocytes . of notice, basal expression of ucp <dig> was lower in pgc-1α-deficient fat cells . a minor decrease in fabp <dig> expression with 10 μm atra and a dose-dependent increase in rarβ expression were observed .

exposing mature pgc-1α+/+ and pgc-1α−/− adipocytes to 1 μm atra elicited significant induction of ucp <dig> after 24 h . thus, enhanced expression of ucp <dig> caused by atra does not require pgc-1α.

atra inhibits human adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner and does not increase ucp <dig> expression
to investigate if chronic treatment with atra had the same effects on human adipocytes as observed with mouse adipocytes, we exposed the human white preadipocyte cell line sgbs  <cit> , human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells   <cit>  and primary human white preadipocytes to various concentrations of atra during differentiation . the human adipocytes were considered mature on day  <dig>  and not on day  <dig> as the mouse adipocytes, as their morphological differentiation into adipocytes was substantially slower. high concentrations of atra inhibited differentiation of sgbs , hmads  and primary preadipocytes , as estimated by expression of fabp <dig> mrna. rarβ expression increased dose-dependently in all three cell models . interestingly, the low basal ucp <dig> mrna levels in sgbs and hmads adipocytes did not increase at any concentration of atra compared with vehicle-treated cells and were lower with  <dig> and 10 μm atra . notably, fabp <dig> expression was not affected by 1 μm atra. basal expression of ucp <dig> in primary preadipocytes exposed to atra during differentiation was strongly inhibited by atra, an inhibition observed even at the lowest concentration used  . levels of ucp <dig> protein were determined in sgbs and hmads adipocytes and confirmed that atra did not increase ucp <dig> levels . acute exposure of mature adipocytes to 1 μm atra did not result in any significant changes in mrna levels of fabp <dig> or mrna and protein levels of ucp <dig> compared to vehicle treatment in sgbs, hmads or primary cells . basal ucp <dig> mrna expression was undetectable in primary human white adipocytes from another donor and expression remained undetectable after treatment with atra . in summary, atra does not increase expression of ucp <dig> in the human adipocyte models studied here.

discussion
in this study, we report the effects of atra on differentiation and ucp <dig> expression in various mouse and human adipocytes. we find that high concentrations of atra inhibit mouse and human adipogenesis, whereas lower concentrations enhance ucp <dig> expression in mouse, but not in human, adipocytes. in addition, we show that the effects of atra are mediated by rars and not by pparδ or other atra-activated nuclear receptors. moreover, the enhanced expression of ucp <dig> in response to atra is independent of pgc-1α.

adipocyte and adipose tissue function are impacted by atra  <cit> . expression of ucp <dig> is reduced in bat of mice fed vitamin a-depleted feed  <cit>  and exogenous atra enhances expression of ucp <dig> in both wat and bat of mice and rats  <cit> . expression of ucp <dig> is induced by atra in primary brown adipocytes from mice and rats as well as in mouse brown adipocyte cell lines  <cit> . moreover, ucp <dig> expression is strongly induced in mef-derived white adipocytes  <cit> . contrary, atra has been reported not to induce expression of ucp <dig> in mature 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes and mouse primary white adipocytes  <cit> . exposure to atra leads to activation of p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase , an activation that is required for full induction of ucp <dig> expression by atra  <cit> .

atra has been reported to activate three nuclear receptors besides rars, namely pparδ, coup-tfii and tr <dig>  the induction of ucp <dig> observed in the mouse cells applied in this study is unlikely to be mediated by coup-tfii and tr <dig>  as the app. ec <dig> of atra are 20 μm  <cit>  and 24 μm  <cit> , respectively, which is  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than the concentrations inducing ucp <dig>  although the ec <dig> of atra for pparδ is much lower than for coup-tfii and tr <dig>   <cit> , pparδ is not mediating the effects of atra either. firstly, the rar agonist ttnpb mimics the effects of atra , but does not bind to pparδ  <cit> . secondly, a potent pparδ agonist does not enhance expression of ucp <dig> . thirdly, a rar antagonist attenuates the effects of atra . in this study, we have not addressed the potential involvement of nongenomic effects of atra, e.g. activation of p <dig> mapk and the cell surface receptor responsible for retinol uptake called stimulated by retinoic acid gene  <dig>  <cit> .

at intermediate concentrations of atra, we consistently observe an induction of ucp <dig> expression in mouse adipocytes. this does not only occur in the mouse cells shown here, but was also observed with wt- <dig> brown adipocytes  <cit>  and 3t3-f442a white adipocytes . thus, our results demonstrate that atra can cause an induction of ucp <dig> expression in white adipocyte cell models of mouse origin. it is tempting to speculate that exposure to atra will cause white preadipocytes and mature adipocytes to transdifferentiate into brown-like adipocytes in vitro. however, in order to confirm if a transdifferentiation event has taken place in our study, a more detailed gene expression analysis is required combined with a characterization of mitochondrial function.

using three cell models of human origin, sgbs and hmads cells as well as primary subcutaneous adipocytes from two different donors, we failed to detect an induction of ucp <dig> expression by atra . hmads cells have been proposed to represent brown or brown-like adipocytes, the latter due to the induction of ucp <dig> expression in response to prolonged culture in the presence of rosiglitazone  <cit>  or upon treatment with atrial natriuretic peptide  <cit> . despite being considered white fat cells, sgbs and primary subcutaneous human adipocytes have the ability to induce expression of ucp <dig> in response to genetic manipulation  <cit> . thus, the lack of effect of atra in the human adipocyte models studied here cannot be explained by an inherent inability to induce expression of ucp <dig>  consistently, to our knowledge, an induction of the endogenous human ucp <dig> gene by atra has never been reported. nevertheless, we cannot rule out that the lack of response in our study is due to the experimental setup or the human cell models used. in particular, it remains to be shown if primary human brown adipocytes respond to atra by increasing ucp <dig> expression. however, as we consistently observe enhanced expression of ucp <dig> by intermediate concentrations of atra in mouse fat cells, we find this difference between mouse and human adipocytes noteworthy.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we demonstrate that atra is a powerful inducer of ucp <dig> expression in mouse white and brown adipocytes, supporting that atra has the capacity to increase the potential for uncoupled respiration in those cells. the increased expression of ucp <dig> in response to atra is mediated by rars, not pparδ, and is independent of pgc-1α. we do not find induction of ucp <dig> gene expression by atra in the human adipocytes studied here, but whether this applies to the human ucp <dig> gene in general remains to be determined. nevertheless, differences between rodents and humans in terms of regulation of ucp <dig> expression are highly relevant, as modulation of bat activity and browning of wat are being considered as potential anti-obesity targets. more studies comparing rodent and human adipocytes are needed to understand their similarities and differences with respect to regulation of ucp <dig> expression.
