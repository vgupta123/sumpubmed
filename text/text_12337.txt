BACKGROUND
maize is an important crop species and is widely used for food, feed, and renewable fuel production. recently, there has been an increasing disparity between human population growth and crop yields  <cit> . understanding the genetic control of trait architecture in maize is important and can accelerate the process of developing new varieties for the breeding community. in a modern breeding platform, a qtl mapping strategy is employed to efficiently identify chromosomal regions  contributing to agronomic traits . furthermore, with the advances of the b <dig> reference genome and a dramatic decrease in sequencing costs, the utilization of next-generation sequencing  for cost-efficient high-throughput genotyping has shown greater advantages compared to the use of traditional markers  <cit> . however, as researchers focus on either basic research or different types of traits in maize breeding, developing a large mapping population with high recombinant rates is needed to detect even the small effect quantitative trait loci  and positional cloning of underlying genes . different types of genetic maps can discern diverse agronomic traits in breeding programs; however, the genotype data are limited for overall comprehensive analysis.

in maize, b <dig> and mo <dig> are the most widely studied inbred lines in two important opposing heterotic groups and are widely used in genetic studies throughout the world. based on crossing and four generations of intermating, the intermated b73 × mo <dig> ril population  has served as a genetic reference mapping population for detecting qtls  and integrating genetic and physical maps  <cit> . furthermore, hussain et al. have constructed an update ten-generation intermated b73 × mo <dig> doubled haploid population , which exhibits a higher genetic resolution than the earlier syn <dig> population version  <cit> , with an almost two-fold increase in the genetic map length. the phenotypic variation present within the ibm population has been used in qtl mapping studies and has served as the reference map in meta-analysis studies and thus is an important resource for the maize genetic research community .

currently, high-throughput re-sequencing strategies are being used to study accurate mapping qtls, the history of maize domestication, and genome structural variations in modern breeding programs. using re-sequencing technologies, huang et al.  <cit>  have developed an ultra-high-density linkage map by using a whole-genome re-sequencing and “bin marker” strategy. they aligned the snps of individual lines and grouped adjacent 100-kb intervals with the same genotype across the entire ril population into a single recombination bin. such recombination bins between two adjacent recombination breakpoints were defined as single “bin markers”. these markers have advanced the detection and calculation of true recombination breakpoints with thousands of bin markers, which can benefit qtl genome-wide analysis. the bin-mapping strategy has been shown to be superior in detecting and fine mapping qtls versus traditional methods . using the same methods, huang et al.  <cit>  have constructed an updated bin map with  <dig>  bin markers among  <dig> lines for qtl mapping. the identification of  <dig> qtls, including ten known causal genes for selective sweeps, has improved understanding of rice domestication. in addition, zhou et al.  <cit>  have constructed an ultra-high-density snp bin map by sequencing an “immortalized f2” population and calculated single-locus and epistatic genetic effects to further understand the biological mechanisms of heterotic performance in rice hybrids. furthermore, by using a bin marker strategy, yield-associated loci in rice  <cit>  and root-knot nematode resistance qtls in soybean have been fine mapped  <cit> , respectively.

in this study, we genotyped the ibm syn <dig> population using bin map strategies and constructed a high-density map by taking advantage of their genetic diversity and bioinformatics analysis. this re-sequencing of the ibm syn <dig> dh population will provide new insights into: 1) the high-quality snp data by deeply re-sequencing the parental line mo <dig> and analyzing the genome variation between b <dig> and mo <dig>  2) an ultra-high-density snp genotype dataset with thousands of recombination bins in the ibm syn <dig> population, and 3) the construction of an integrated map with high-quality snp, ssr, rflp, idp, and bin markers. our results provide a broad-interest dataset for advanced forward genetics research and community resources, thus accelerate the molecular breeding process. furthermore, there are huge computational burdens for the analysis of the various phenotype datasets, such as genetic linkage map construction and qtl mapping, due to a lack of suitable software for sequencing data. thus, we parallelized the composite interval mapping  function of qtl cartographer, and integrated it into the iplant discovery environment  to reduce the bottleneck of large-scale qtl analysis  <cit> . additionally, via the iplant platform, we provide a readily accessible community resource to molecular breeding community.

RESULTS
mo <dig> re-sequencing and genome variation in comparison with b73
in this study, we performed a deep re-sequencing of the inbred line mo <dig>  to construct a high-quality set of snps with the b <dig> reference genome. mo <dig> re-sequencing yielded  <dig>  gb of data. in total,  <dig>  % of the clean reads were aligned to the b <dig> reference with  <dig>  % coverage of the genome. in total, there were  <dig> , <dig> snps between mo <dig> and b <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> snp markers were homozygous with both parents but polymorphic between parents . of these homozygous snp markers,  <dig> , <dig> had uniquely physical coordinates in the b <dig> genome, and were retained for bin map construction, whereas the multiple-alignment snps that were inconsistent with the reference genome were discarded. the distribution of homozygous snps along the chromosomes indicated a high and uniform coverage across the whole genome . we also identified  <dig>  indels that ranged from 1 bp to 5 bp in mo <dig> relative to b <dig> reference, of which  <dig>   were insertions and  <dig>   were deletions; homozygous and heterozygous indel variations were  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively . the snp and indel distribution are illustrated in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> genome-wide snp distribution and genetic variation throughout the maize genome. a. gene density of chromosomes is visualized by line darkness and the gene density is proportional to color depth. b. density of genic snps on chromosomes are visualized by line redness. c. density of snps in cds  is visualized by line greenness. d. density of indels  are visualized by line blueness



genotype calling in ibm syn <dig> and bin map construction
an average of ~ 640 mb of data was generated for each ibm syn <dig> line , which was equivalent to ~  <dig> × coverage of the maize genome. the detected snps were presented in additional file  <dig>  a bin map was constructed with  <dig>  recombination breakpoints for all lines, in which each line contained an average of  <dig> breakpoints. the  <dig> individuals were merged into bin maps  comprising  <dig>  recombination bins, which captured the vast majority of the recombination events  <cit>  . the physical length per recombination bin ranged from 50 kb to  <dig>  mb with an average of  <dig>  mb. in total,  <dig>  bins  were less than 1 mb,  <dig> bins ranged from 1 mb to 10 mb in length, and only ten bins were in the range of 10–20 mb. the detected bin numbers in our data were approximately a  <dig> -fold   <cit>  to  <dig> -fold   <cit>  increase compared with previous research on rice.fig.  <dig> recombination bin map of the ibm syn <dig> population. bin map consisting of  <dig>  bin was inferred from  <dig> , <dig> homologous high quality snps markers in the ibm syn <dig> population. physical positions are based on b73_refgen_v <dig>  red, mo <dig> genotype; blue, b <dig> genotype



genetic linkage maps of the ibm syn <dig> dh population
a high-density genetic map was constructed for the ibm syn <dig> population with all  <dig>  recombination bin markers  <cit> . the map quality was reliable as only adjacent markers showed strong linkage with  <dig> .5 cm genetic distance in the map . the average genetic distance of the bin markers was  <dig>  cm, which represented an increase in the marker density compared with the  <dig>  cm observed between the adjacent markers, for a total of  <dig> .7 cm with  <dig>  markers in the syn <dig> population.

common features, such as the recombination rate and genetic vs. physical distance were compared between the syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations. figure  <dig> shows the relationship between the genetic and physical positions on all chromosomes between the two populations. the recombination suppression was observed near the centromeres, and higher recombination rates were found to be predominant near both telomeres. the average ratio of genetic-to-physical distance was  <dig>  cm/mb for the whole genome, which is higher than that of the syn <dig> population .fig.  <dig> plots of genetic vs. physical distance and corresponding recombination rates between the ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig> population. x-axis: physical position  of the bin/ ssr markers on the b <dig> physical map. left y-axis: genetic positions of bin/ssr markers on ibm syn <dig>  and ibm syn <dig>  linkage maps. right y-axis: recombination rate in centimorgen per mega base pair  for ibm syn <dig>  and ibm syn <dig> . recombination rate  of each region was obtained as the quotient calculated from genetic and physical distance of two adjacent markers. dashed black line in each chromosome represent the centromere physical position



the syn <dig> genetic map could efficiently discover mis-assembled b <dig> genome. ganal et al. <cit>  have used snp arrays with  <dig>  markers, which were genetically aligned into the ibm syn <dig> map and physically placed on the b <dig> reference genome. these results have shown that several linked snps of chromosome  <dig> are erroneously positioned on chromosome  <dig>  in our study, a 600-kb fragment composed of  <dig> bins was detected in ibm syn <dig>  and re-assigned from chromosome  <dig> to chromosome  <dig> due to an excess of double-crossover events. in consequence, bin markers chr <dig> . <dig>  chr <dig> . <dig>  chr <dig> . <dig>  and chr <dig> . <dig> were not placed on chromosome  <dig> but instead were placed on chromosome  <dig> between 115 mb and  <dig>  mb , which reduced the number of double-crossover events. this finding, which was consistent with those in a previous report, indicated that the results are robust for de novo genetic mapping and reference map updating, although the bin markers were obtained from alignment-based procedures.

segregation distortion and map expansion
a total of  <dig>   markers in syn <dig> showed distorted segregation  in contrast to  <dig>  markers in syn <dig>  of the segregation distortion markers,  <dig>   of the markers in syn <dig> showed a preference toward the genotype of b <dig> in contrast to  <dig>  in syn4; the other  <dig>  markers in syn <dig> showed a preference toward mo <dig>  whereas only  <dig>  markers were observed in syn <dig>  using the genetic composition survey,  <dig>  lines of syn <dig> were found to be biased toward the genetic background of b <dig> in contrast to  <dig>  in syn <dig>  and  <dig>  lines of syn <dig> were biased toward mo <dig> in contrast to  <dig>  in syn <dig>  . the average percentage of markers inherited from b <dig> in ibm syn <dig> was higher than that in ibm syn <dig> .

the expected expansion factors were  <dig>  and  <dig> for the ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations, respectively. the maps were adjusted to f2-based maps. the length of the adjusted map of ibm syn <dig> was  <dig> .7 cm, which was consistent with previous reports   <cit> . the observed expansion factor of ibm syn <dig> was  <dig>  . the map of ibm syn <dig> was adjusted directly by the expected expansion factor and the length of the adjusted map was  <dig> .9 cm .

genome-wide qtl analysis for plant height and flowering time
in total, we detected  <dig> qtls for plant height and flowering time in the syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations. in the syn <dig> population,  <dig> qtls for flowering time were detected, including seven pairs of qtls that overlapped on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> among different years, whereas thirty-two qtls for plant height were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in the syn <dig> population,  <dig> qtls were detected for the flowering time, which included five pairs of qtls that overlapped on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> during different years;  <dig> qtls were detected for plant height, which included six pairs of qtls that overlapped on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . by comparing the syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations, we found eight overlapping genome regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for the flowering time qtl and five regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for plant height qtl across various environments. the syn <dig> population exhibited a  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increase in the physical confidence interval compared to the syn <dig> population when comparing the median values for those two traits . a total of  <dig> qtls in syn <dig>  spanned a physical interval of less than 1 mb, in contrast to eight qtls  in syn <dig>  a total of  <dig> qtls  spanned a physical interval from 1 mb to 5 mb in syn <dig> and  <dig> qtls in syn <dig> . ten qtls  exceeded a physical interval size of 5 mb in syn <dig> and  <dig> qtls in syn <dig>  .fig.  <dig> genome-wide qtl mapping for flowering time and plant height traits in the ibm syn <dig> population. the triangles on the right of the  <dig> chromosomes represent qtls of plant height  and flowering time  in the year  <dig>  and  <dig> . the triangles surrounded by quadrilateral represent the qtls detected in both ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations

high-quality snp recalling and integrated map construction
a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality snps were generated from the parental snp set. in total,  <dig>  % of the snps  were verified at least once from the  <dig> lines in the syn <dig> population, and  <dig>  % of the snps were excluded because no snps were successfully validated from the syn <dig> population. in our database,  <dig>  %  were verified 1– <dig> times in the syn <dig> population. additionally,  <dig>  %  were verified more than five times in the syn <dig> population. finally, a total of  <dig>  ssr, rflp, and idp markers with precise physical coordinates as well as extra  <dig>  bin markers and  <dig> , <dig> snps were collected to create a high-quality and density-integrated map .fig.  <dig> marker density of integrated map consisting of  <dig>  traditional  markers,  <dig> bin markers, and  <dig> , <dig> high quality snps. x-axis: physical position on  <dig> chromosomes. left y-axis: density of snp markers . right y-axis: density of bin markers , and ssr marker . the marker density on the genome was calculated by sliding non-overlapping windows using window size of 10 mb



discussion
high-quality snps as a community resource for maize breeding in the iplant platform
the iplant collaborative  provides with open data access, pipeline process, and computing power. all of the data presented in this study can be found and re-analyzed via the iplant discovery environment . all of the snps between parents were verified in the ibm syn <dig> population. among the  <dig> marker genotype combinations that were verified by sequenom massarray,  <dig>  showed genotypes consistent with the data from re-sequencing and sequenom-based genotyping . we compared our snp data from mo <dig> with the data that were available in the maizegdb database. from our data set of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality snps,  <dig>   snps had records in maizegdb, whereas  <dig>   snps were found to be novel. the high content of repeats in the maize genome introduces a high error probability in the process of snp calling, owing to possible incorrect alignments  <cit> . in this study,  <dig>   of the overlapping snps between maizegdb mo <dig> snps and our dataset had consistent genotypes. in addition, our mo <dig> data were compared with maize hapmap <dig> data  <cit> , and  <dig> , <dig>  snps have been reported in hapmap <dig>  among the reported snps,  <dig>   snps of mo <dig> showed consistent genotypes in our study, and  <dig>   <dig>  were missing in mo <dig> of hapmap <dig> ; only  <dig>   showed inconsistent genotypes . in summary, our mo <dig> snp set is an important complement for data that were previously reported, and the new reliable snp dataset has been combined with both bin markers and traditional markers to construct an integrated map, which will be valuable for further applications such as molecular breeding.

map expansion and inadvertent selection
map expansion is a common phenomenon in genetic research  <cit> . the observed recombination fraction of linked loci and the increasing map length with each generation are caused by the accumulation of crossovers during meiosis. an expanded map that is robust for qtl mapping reflects the actual recombination fractions. adjusted f2-based maps are convenient for the comparison of different populations. although ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig> have different lengths of their expanded maps, similar lengths of the adjusted maps were expected because they were derived from the same parents. winkler et al. have deduced an equation for ril and iril, which was appropriate for ibm syn <dig>  <cit> . because ibm syn <dig> was constructed by producing doubled haploids as a final step, the theory equation was not suitable for this study. in a previous simulation study, the length of the expanded map tended to be underestimated when the marker density was not saturated. this bias disproportionally decreased with increasing marker density  <cit> . consistently with previous simulations, the observed expansion factor of ibm syn <dig> was lower than the expected expansion factor  under the limited density of genetic markers, and a similar underestimation has been reported in mice  <cit> . for ibm syn <dig>  this bias can be ignored given the higher marker density. thus, the genetic coordinates of the markers in the ibm syn <dig> map were adjusted by the expected map expansion factor. this treatment was justified by the results of our adjustment, in which comparable lengths of adjusted maps,  <dig> .7 cm vs.  <dig> .9 cm were obtained for ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig>  respectively.

segregation distortion has been widely reported in mapping populations, which distorts the frequency of the genotypes from the expected mendelian ratio  <cit> . segregation distortion was observed in the present analysis and was associated with the number of markers in both the syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations. the distorted markers showed the same preferential segregation in most parts of the genome . furthermore, the syn <dig> markers were subjected to more severe segregation distortion, and the average percentage of markers inherited from b <dig> in syn <dig> was higher than that in syn <dig>  we inferred that the higher segregation distortion of syn <dig> results from a greater number of inter-mating generations and meiotic events driving in the process of double-haploid formation  <cit> . although there was more severe segregation in syn <dig>  there was not an obvious difference in the results of the qtl mapping between the two populations. similar numbers of qtl were detected, and there was no significant difference in the average qtl effect between the two populations . this finding was consistent with the previous conclusion that the effect of distortion could be ignored in large mapping populations  <cit> .

in many plant species, the most commonly reported genetic factors associated with a distorted segregation ratio are the genes associated with gametophytes or sterility  <cit> . in maize, inadvertent selection is potentially preferred to healthy and early flowering plants  <cit> ; as a result, the flowering time was also a potential factor for segregation distortion  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> markers were located in flowering time qtls, and  <dig> and  <dig> markers were located in segregation distortion regions  in ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig>  respectively. enrichment of distorted markers in regions of flowering time qtl were not significant compared to the whole genome in both populations . by further investigating  <dig> qtls under most severe segregation distortion , the correlated relation between the orientation of the qtl additive effect was observed to be correlated with that of the segregation distortion. in both populations, the genotype of markers in these qtls preferred to exist in the parent with a negative additive effect in the corresponding qtl . the only one exception was the qtl  on chromosome  <dig> that showed a preference toward the b <dig> genotype, which had a positive additive effect in the qtl.fig.  <dig> overlap of orientation, physical coordinate of segregation distortion regions, and additive effect of two flowering time qtls on chromosome  <dig>  x axis: physical coordinate on the b <dig> chromosomes. left y axis: b <dig> allele frequency in ibm populations. right y axis: the additive effect of flowering time of qtl inherited from b <dig>  blue hollow circles and red hollow circles represent markers of ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig>  respectively, b <dig> allele frequency of each marker was obtained by dividing the number of progeny by genotype of b <dig> allele using total number of progeny with non-missing genotype. adjacent circles from the same population were connected by solid line to show variation tendency of b <dig> allele frequency among the genome. blue and red dashed lines represent 99 % confidence interval for the “no distortion” hypothesis in the syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations, respectively. the information of two flowering time qtl such as physical coordinate, length, additive effect were indicated by two blue thick lines



markers in flowering time qtl did not show more universal segregation distortion compared to the whole genome in our study. we inferred that the additive effect of most flowering time qtls varied widely under different environments; as a result, the effect of inadvertent selection did not accumulate over generations for most flowering qtls. only the qtls with stable effects were under continuous inadvertent selection, and the genotype of these qtls preferred to the parent with a negative additive effect, which could shorten the flowering time. this phenomenon was especially obvious on chromosome  <dig>  there were two sdrs in the region of 140 ~ 150 mb on chromosome  <dig> and both sdrs preferred the genotype of mo <dig>  two qtls, qsyn10-ft- <dig> and qsyn10-ft- <dig>  dramatically overlapped with the peak of these two sdrs ; meanwhile, mo <dig> had a negative additive effect on the two qtl . it is plausible that such sdrs were driven by inadvertent selection for flowering time. only the segregation distortion of the exceptional qtl qsyn10-ft- <dig> appeared to be driven by some other factors, such as gametophyte genes.

superiority in the bin map of ibm syn10
in rice, previous studies  <cit>  demonstrated that the bin map strategy offered complete genome coverage and was cost efficient and time saving compared to traditional molecular marker methods for detecting qtls. in these rice studies, several high-density genetic maps  were constructed with an average of ~ <dig> × genome coverage. compared with previous reports, the bin map constructed in our study increased the marker density: the average ~ <dig> × genome coverage was expected to be sufficient for detecting most recombination events. in spite of a nearly six-fold increase in genome coverage compared to a previous study in rice , some regions in syn <dig> still exhibited longer physical lengths between bin markers, especially in the regions near the centromeres of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  with ten larger bins that ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. this finding can be explained by the lack of recombination around centromeres  <cit> .

the length of the observed map of the ibm syn <dig> population was longer than the previously reported lengths of the ibm syn <dig> and f <dig> populations  <cit>  . as a result of map expansion, higher qtl mapping resolution was expected in the syn <dig> population. this finding was verified by a comparison of the qtl interval lengths of the syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations. the median interval length of the plant height and flowering time qtl of syn <dig> was  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold lower than in syn <dig>  respectively . i.e. the qtl mapping resolution of syn <dig> showed a three-fold increase compared to syn <dig>  with only a  <dig> -fold increase in the length of the genetic map. given that the effective population size of syn <dig> for qtl mapping was smaller than the syn <dig> population , the extra increase in the mapping resolution was due not only to the higher recombination fraction in syn <dig> but also the higher marker density.

accuracy of qtl fine mapping in the syn <dig> population and identification of candidate genes
based on the positional cloning of qtl, we were interested in determining the genetic resolution in ibm syn <dig>  to verify the accuracy of the qtl detection, we used  <dig> published genes, including cloned and functionally verified genes, candidate genes from genome-wide association studies , and genes that are homologous to known genes from other species . across all of the qtl across the two traits, we found a total of  <dig> cloned genes in the qtl regions, including  <dig> cloned genes for the flowering time and two for the plant height. two known genes, tfl <dig> and phya <dig> , both of which encode the heterochromatin protein  <dig> homolog and repress flowering, were detected in a  <dig> -mb region on chromosome  <dig>  the zmhy <dig>   gene, which encodes a phytochromobilin synthase, was detected and constrained to a  <dig> -mb region on chromosome  <dig>  among qtls with underlying cloned genes, most of the genes were constrained to  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. for seven genes, the physical coordinates of the genes did not match well with the qtl position .fig.  <dig> precise location of  <dig> qtl harboring  <dig> cloned genes. the head of each sub-plot is the code name of qtl. curves in plot indicate the physical coordinate  and lod  values of detected qtl. the red dash line indicates the lod threshold . arrowheads represent the relatively physical position of a cloned gene. qsyn10-ft- <dig> , qsyn10-ft- <dig> , qsyn10-ft- <dig>  and qsyn10-ft- <dig>  indicate the qtls detected in ibm syn <dig> for flowering time



with the integration of linkage mapping and comparative mapping,  <dig> candidate genes were mapped based on previous studies, including rice genes that affect the flowering time and plant height . on chromosome  <dig>  ranging from  <dig> ,871 bp to  <dig> ,107 bp, three candidate genes overlap with qtls . the candidate gene dof  encodes a zinc-finger protein, pi  , which is related to the pistillata gene, a mads-box gene, and the candidate gene gwas-dat- <dig> , which is in the mitochondrial carrier family. in summary, a densely mapped ibm syn <dig> population will help to identify and limit the number of positional candidate genes in qtl studies and identify promising candidates based on the sequence homology to characterized genes as a result of the availability of the b <dig> genome sequence.fig.  <dig> precise location of  <dig> qtl harboring  <dig> candidate genes. the head of each sub-plot is the code name of qtl. curves in plot indicate the physical coordinate  and lod  values of detected qtl. the red dash line indicates the lod threshold . arrowheads represent the relatively physical position of a candidate gene. qsyn10-ft- <dig>   <dig> indicated the qtls detected in ibm syn <dig> population for flowering time , qsyn10-plht- <dig>   <dig> indicated the qtls detected in ibm syn <dig> population for plant height .



methods
plant material and dna isolation
genotype data for a set of  <dig> ibm syn <dig> rils are available at   <cit> . the ibm syn <dig> dh lines were developed from maize inbred lines b <dig> and mo <dig> with ten generations of random mating, which were inter-mated after the f <dig> . in this study,  <dig> of the ibm syn <dig> dh lines  were used for genotyping, whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> lines were only used to collect phenotype data. both ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig> populations were planted in separate but adjacent fields at the agronomy agricultural engineering research center, ames, iowa, in  <dig> and  <dig>  growing degree days  were calculated in °c day from planting until the date when at least 50 % of the tassels in the plots were shedding pollen. the plant height  was measured from the soil surface to the flag leaf collar on five representative plants within each plot. in  <dig>   <dig> of the ibm syn <dig> dh lines and mo <dig> were planted in the agronomy greenhouse of iowa state university for genomic dna extraction using the ctab method as previously described  <cit> .

sequencing and short-read alignments
at least 5 μg of genomic dna from each sample was randomly fragmented by sonication and ~500 bp dna fragments were purified and size-selected to construct library. adapter ligation and dna cluster preparation were performed, and sequencing was conducted by using an illumina hiseq <dig> instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions . indexed dna samples of eight ibm lines were combined and sequenced per lane. the short reads were aligned to the maize reference genome   <cit>  using soapaligner, version  <dig>   . based on the mapping results, the alignment reads and unique hit reads in each sample were classified by soap <dig> 

snp detection and annotation of mo17
the same procedure for detecting high-quality snps between parents of mo <dig> and b <dig> was used as previously described  <cit> . in summary, we first calculated the likelihood of the mo <dig> inbred line’s genotype using soapsnp and obtained the consensus sequence . second, polymorphic loci compared to the b <dig> reference sequence were extracted using the consensus sequence. finally, snp determination was performed only for sites with sufficient quality .

candidate snps having sufficient quality based on the following criteria were kept:  <dig> ≤ depth ≤  <dig>  average mappable sites <  <dig> , and a sufficient quality score . to exclude snp calling errors caused by incorrect mapping or indels, adjacent snps that were separated by < 5 bp were not called. these snps were used to construct the whole-genome snp and bin map  <cit> . the localization of snps in annotated regions was based on b73_refgen_v <dig> in the phytozome  <dig>  database   <cit> .

short-indel detection of mo17
small insertions and deletions  were detected by mapping the reads to b <dig>  using soapindel, version  <dig>  . for short-indel detection, the paired-end reads that contained alignment gaps at only one end were allowed. short indels were identified in three subsequent steps:  mapping the paired-end reads to the b <dig> reference sequence by fitting up to a 5-bp gap,  merging the redundant pairs prior to searching for indels, and  extracting of gaps that were supported by at least three non-redundant paired-end reads and had a quality score  higher than  <dig>  <cit> .

genotyping and bin map construction of ibm syn10
for each dh line, the 90-bp reads  were sorted according to 5′ indexes. in average, ~640 mb sequences were generated for each dh line, which was equivalent to  <dig> × coverage of the b <dig> genome. the custom-made mo <dig> pseudomolecules were generated by replacing b <dig> pseudomolecule sequences with those of mo <dig> at snp sites. the reads from dh lines were aligned against the b <dig> and mo <dig> pseudomolecules using soapaligner, respectively. the reads that mapped uniquely to either parent but with at most a 1-bp mismatch were called as high-quality snps. the reads that matched multiple locations or contained low-quality sequences  were discarded. finally, a subset of snps, which excluded the low-quality snps, was aligned to the chromosomes according to their physical location  <cit> . two custom perl scripts were written to accurately detect the genotype for each genomic region and to identify recombination breakpoints.

bin maps were then constructed for the  <dig> dh lines. consecutive snps were examined with a sliding window approach  and used to calculate the ratio between the numbers of snps from the two parents in each window. as the window slides along the chromosome, recombination breakpoints can be determined. the window size was dynamic depending on the snp density within a given dh line  <cit> . the map of each individual line was aligned, and genotypes were determined for each 100-kb interval. adjacent 100-kb intervals with the same genotype in each line were merged into a bin using two custom perl scripts.

a high-density genetic map was constructed for ibm syn <dig> across all  <dig>  recombination bins. the genotype of each recombination bin was represented by a bin marker, which was defined as a set of genetically linked snps of the same genotype that were collected into a single bin group with a physical position located in the middle of each recombination bin, which was used as a virtual bin marker to genotype the population.

two different software packages were used for genetic map construction: joinmap  <dig>   <cit>  and mstmap  <cit> . joinmap  <dig>  was used for marker grouping using two-point maximum likelihood distance analysis. ten linkage groups, along with one additional very small linkage group, were determined by applying an independent lod  value of  <dig>  initial map orders were assembled using mstmap and the kosambi map function using a maximum-likelihood algorithm because of the high computational efficiency of mstmap  <cit> . the marker order of each linkage group was further optimized by joinmap  <dig>  with the maximum-likelihood algorithm. multipoint recombination frequencies were estimated by gibbs sampling. four monte carlo em cycles with chain lengths of  <dig>  were run after a burn-in period of  <dig>  steps. the marker order was established by simulated annealing using a maximum-likelihood approach. simulation began with an initial acceptance probability of  <dig>  and a cooling control parameter of  <dig> . the chain length of the iterations was  <dig> . the chain with a constant acceptance probability was maintained, and the next chain was allowed to run with a smaller acceptable probability. the iterations were stopped after  <dig>  chains without improvement. recombination fractions of all pairs of markers were estimated and visualized in additional file  <dig> to evaluate the quality of the genetic map.

segregation distortion and adjustment for map expansion
segregation distortion was tested for  <dig>  bin markers of the syn <dig> population and  <dig>  ssr markers of syn <dig> using a chi-squared test. among the progeny lines in both populations, a 1: <dig> segregation was expected for all of the polymorphic markers. we expected that, on average, across all of the markers and lines, both parents would contribute 50 % to their genomes. in the mapping population, the segregation of linked markers was not independent, and the proportion of significant markers was very large in our study . thus, the effect of the false positives was expected to be limited, and we did not correct for multiple comparisons.

the genetic maps of both ibm syn <dig> and syn <dig> were adjusted to an f2-based map . the expected expansion factors were determined by the equation α=j2+2j−12i,. where j is the number of intermating generations, including the two generations for creating the f <dig>  and i is the number of inbred generations after intermating  <cit> . for ibmsyn <dig>  j =  <dig> and i = ∞. for ibm syn <dig>  j =  <dig> and i =  <dig>  because only one generation proceeded in the process of double-haploid development. the map of ibm syn <dig> was adjusted according to the adjustment equation for intermated recombination inbred lines   <cit> . the map of ibm syn <dig> was adjusted directly by using the expected expansion factor. each genetic interval between markers was divided by the expected expansion factor to generate an adjusted map.

qtl mapping and analysis
a total of  <dig> ibm syn <dig> dh lines were used for qtl analyses due to a lack of phenotypic information in the remaining  <dig> lines. the genetic distances of the bin-markers were re-calculated among those  <dig> dh lines for the purpose of qtl mapping. subsequently, qtl analysis was performed according to the observed expanded map by using qtl cartographer unix version  <dig>  f  <cit> . composite interval mapping for population type “ri0” was used . the ten most significant cofactors were identified by using forward and backward regression with a window size of 5 cm and a step size of  <dig>  cm. qtls with lod values that were larger than  <dig>  were called, for which the qtl location was determined, including 2-lod drop support intervals. the same parameters, but for population-type “ril,” were applied to qtl analysis of the ibm syn <dig> population, which was genotyped with  <dig>  markers . the integrated version of iplant cim were parallelized for simultaneously analyzing multiple traits and chromosomes.

comparison of the qtl locations
the qtl locations of the two populations were compared according to the physical position of the flanking markers of each 2-lod drop support interval. only  <dig> markers  had physical position information among the  <dig>  markers used for analysis in the syn <dig> population. the physical position of the remaining  <dig> non-informative markers was imputed. first, the maize genome was separated into regions on the basis of informative markers, and the average recombination rate  of each region was calculated as the quotient of the physical distance divided by the genetic distance of two adjacent informative markers. the physical position of non-informative markers within each region was assigned according to its genetic distance relative to the informative markers and the average recombination rate of the region.

integrated map construction
the ssr and idp markers for the integrated map were collected from the maizegdb website , which was previously published as an isu integrated ibm  <dig> map. maizegdb  was used to recalculate the map distance via blast on b <dig> refgen_v <dig> by sequence similarity. hence, we collected only the markers with a unique position in the b <dig> reference genome. bin marker data were calculated based on the physical position as described above. snp markers were verified and filtered by identity by descent  in syn <dig> lines before they were integrated into an integrated map:  for each syn <dig> line, the expected genotype was assigned to snps in each recombination bin according to the genotype of the bin marker because snps and the corresponding bin marker were ibd.  for each syn <dig> line, the observed genotype of the snps were obtained from sequencing data; only snps with consistently expected and observed genotypes were maintained, and inconsistent snps were discarded.  for a snp marker between parents, if one progeny line showed a consistent genotype at this locus, then this locus was judged to be verified once. only the snp loci with at least one verification were retained as high-quality parent snps. finally, we used the physical coordinates of ssr, idp, bin, and high-quality parental snp markers to create a high-quality and density-integrated map by using custom perl and shell scripts.

high-quality parent snp verification
to verify the accuracy of snp genotypes among the parents and progeny in syn <dig>  we randomly selected  <dig> snps from the whole genome. the sequenom primer design software  was employed for snp primer design. the two parents and ten random progenies of syn <dig> were selected for genotyping. experiments were conducted according to the sequenom iplex assay application protocol  <cit> . genotyping data were acquired using the sequenom massarray and processed using sequenom typer <dig>  software  <cit> . among the  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps were successfully designed and genotyped. among the  <dig>   marker genotype combinations,  <dig> generated missing data, and  <dig> resulted in heterozygous genotypes . the parents and dh progenies were expected to be homozygous, especially the progenies. therefore, the heterozygous genotypes were considered to be genotyping errors. the missing and heterozygous genotypes from this sequenom genotyping were discarded, leaving  <dig> effective sites for verification. the high-quality snps of mo <dig> were compared with those available in the maizegdb database and the maize hapmap <dig> database.

data access
the re-sequencing data for mo <dig> and the ibm syn <dig> population have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive   under accession number srp <dig>  the snps, bin markers, linkage maps, trait data, and parallelized cim are accessible through the iplant de .

CONCLUSIONS
in briefly, our founding provides high value basis data for researchers not only for qtl mapping but also in chip building for molecular breeding. 1) we combine a million of high quality snps,  <dig> traditional markers and  <dig> bin markers together for qtl mapping and molecular breeding. all of the snps which come from mo <dig> and b <dig> had been carefully checked and part of them had been verified by using the sequenom massarray and presenting a high accuracy rates in the dataset; 2) fine mapping eighteen functional known genes and twenty-five candidate genes by bin map strategy, map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development were observed; 3) all of the data were public resource and easily used via the iplant platform . overall, our findings provide a fundamentally genetic data for qtl mapping in an updated ibm syn <dig> population and provide a reliable and verified high quality snp set between mo <dig> and b <dig> as a basic data resources for maize committee around the world.
