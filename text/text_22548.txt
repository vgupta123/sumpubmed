BACKGROUND
siraitia grosvenorii, which belongs to the cucurbitaceae family, has long been used in traditional chinese medicine as a natural sweetener and as a folk medicine for the treatment of lung congestion, colds and sore throats. in recent years, important pharmacological characteristics, such as anti-cancer and anti-hyperglycemic effects and inhibition of oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein, have been reported  <cit> . many cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides have been isolated and characterized from the fruits  <cit> . the mixed mogrosides have been estimated to be about  <dig> times as sweet as sucrose so that an 80% extract was nearly  <dig> times sweeter than sugar  <cit> . among them, mogroside v which accounts to 20% of mogrosides is extremely sweet. the purified, sweet principle, mogroside v, has been approved as a high-intensity sweetening agent in japan  <cit>  and the non-caloric sweet taste extract is a generally recognized as safe  non-nutritive sweetener, flavor enhancer, and food ingredient in the usa  <cit> .

the active components responsible for the sweetness are mogrosides, which are members of the family of triterpene glycosides. in studies the relationships of the structure and the taste, the number of glucose units at the  <dig> and 24-position of the aglycone moiety are thought responsible for the perception of taste  <cit> . among them, mogroside iv, v and mogroside vi which have more glucose units and are extremely sweet, but the fruit also contains some tasteless glycosides, as well as bitter-tasting glycosides such as mogroside iii and mogroside ii e which possess less glucose units . previous research has indicated that the bitter mogroside ii e and tasteless mogroside iii are the main products in the fruit at the early growing stage, but these decrease as the fruit matures  <cit> . the content of mogroside v increases rapidly from  <dig> to  <dig> daf, and levels off after  <dig> daf.

although the various chemical and pharmacological properties of mogrosides in s. grosvenorii have been extensively studied, the biosynthetic pathway of the mogrosides remains poorly understood. triterpene saponins are synthesized via the isoprenoid pathway by cyclization of  <dig>  3-oxidosqualene to give primarily cucurbitane skeleton. the triterpenoid backbone then undergoes various modifications  mediated by cytochrome p450-dependent monooxygenases, glycosyltransferases and other enzymes  <cit> . mogrosides, cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides, are synthesized by the isoprenoid pathway and share the same precursor,  <dig>  3-oxidosqualene, with sterol. in the early stage of active isoprene unit formation, both the cytosolic mevalonate pathway  and the plastidial 2-cmethyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway  can produce isopentenyl diphosphate , which is then converted to its allylic isomer, isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate , through the action of ipp isomerase  <cit> . triterpenoids are known to be formed by the mva pathway because they are cytosolic products. however, there are examples that two pathways can act cooperatively to create a molecule  <cit> . little progress has been made toward determining the precise source of isoprene units in mogrosides biosynthesis. due to the biological importance of sterol and diterpenoid, the previous steps in its conversion from acetyl-coa  and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  to ipp have been widely studied in many plant species, but the next steps are still unclear, especially the late steps of the pathway. the cyclization of oxidosqualene is the branch point for the biosynthesis of mogrosides and sterol. however, the portion of the pathway that lies downstream of cyclization remains largely unknown. according to the proposed pathway , some specific cyp450s and udp-glycosyltransferases  may catalyze the conversion of cucurbitadienol to various mogrosides. to date, no genes involved in mogroside biosynthesis have been identified from s. grosvenorii or other mogrosides-producing plants.

next generation sequencing technology  has emerged as a cost effective approach for high-throughput sequence determination that has dramatically improved the efficiency and speed of gene discovery  <cit> . rna-seq refers to whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing wherein mrna or cdna is mechanically fragmented, resulting in overlapping short fragments that cover the entire transcriptome. dge is a tag-based transcriptome sequencing approach where short raw tags are generated by endonuclease. the expression level of genes in the sample is measured by counting the number of individual mrna molecules produced from each gene. a combination of rna-seq and dge approaches is powerful, as it leverages the advantages of each, enabling both large scale functional assignment of genes via the assembly of large sequenced transcriptome library , and the ability to easily perform quantitative gene expression comparisons without potential bias, allowing for a more sensitive and accurate profiling of the transcriptome that more closely resembles the biology of the cell   <cit> . despite the commercial and medicinal importance of s. grosvenorii, rna-seq and dge have not yet been applied to s. grosvenorii genomic research.

in this study a cdna library generated from of equal amount of rna taken from s. grosvenorii fruit at  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf were sequenced using illumina/solexa platform. more than  <dig> , <dig> hq reads from a cdna library generated that was assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. bioinformatic analysis indicated that cdna sequences could be identified that matched all known enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the mogroside backbone. dge of s. grosvenorii at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daf identified seven cyp450s and five udpgs out of a total of eighty-five cyp <dig> and ninety udpg unigenes, as potential candidate genes responsible for mogroside backbone modifications. these results demonstrated the powerful ability of high-throughput sequencing to identify candidate genes involved in novel metabolic pathways in non-model plant systems.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and de novo assembly
to obtain an overview of the s. grosvenorii fruit transcriptome, a cdna library was generated from an equal mixture of rna isolated from  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf fruits, and pair end sequenced using the illumina platform. after cleaning and quality checks,  <dig> million of  <dig> bp reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs . the mean contig size was  <dig> bp with a length ranging from as small as  <dig> bp to as large as  <dig>  bp. using paired-end joining and gap-filling, the contigs were further assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds with a mean size of  <dig> bp including  <dig>  scaffolds larger than  <dig>  bp . after clustering using tgicl software  <cit> , the  <dig>  scaffolds generated  <dig>  unigenes  with a mean size of  <dig> bp. the size distribution of these contigs, scaffolds and unigenes is shown in additional file  <dig> 

annotation of predicted proteins
for annotation, distinct gene sequences were first searched using blastx against the non-redundant  ncbi nucleotide database using a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  using this approach,  <dig>  unigenes  returned a significant blast result . because of the relatively long length of unigenes  and the addition of  <dig> uni-ests from a suppression subtractive hybridization cdna library of s. grosvernorii as a reference , most of the  <dig>  assembled sequences have been matched to known genes .

gene ontology  classification
go assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted s. grosvenorii genes. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  sequences can be categorized into  <dig> functional groups . in each of the three main categories  of the go classification, 'metabolic process', 'cell'&'cell part' and 'binding' terms are dominant respectively. we also noticed a high-percentage of genes from categories of 'cellular process', 'organelle' and 'catalytic' and only a few genes from terms of 'biological adhesion', 'extracellular region part' and 'nutrient reservoir' . the go analysis showed that the functions of the identified genes are involved various biological processes.  <dig>  sequences were annotated as 'metabolic process' category, which suggests that our study may allow for the identification of novel genes involved in the secondary metabolite synthesis pathways.

functional classification by kegg
functional classification and pathway assignment was performed by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> . first, the  <dig>  unique sequences were compared using blastx with an e-value cutoff of < 10- <dig> against the kegg database. to identify the biological pathways that are active in the s. grosvenorii, the  <dig>  annotated sequences were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in kegg. in total,  <dig>  sequences were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the pathways with most representation by the unigenes were starch and sucrose metabolism , purine metabolism  and pyrimidine metabolism . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways during s. grosvenorii research. interestingly,  <dig> unigenes involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were found . among them, the cluster for 'phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ' represents the largest group  followed by 'limonene and pinene degradation '  and 'stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis ' . mogrosides belong to the terpenoid saponins, which share a common pathway from acetyl-coa to  <dig>  3-oxidosqualene with sterol. most of the enzymes identified in the fruit cdna library were mapped into the terpenoid backbone  and sterol biosynthesis  groups by kegg. all of the genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the mogroside backbone were present in our transcriptome of the s. grosvenorii fruit . in most cases, more than one unigene was annotated as the same enzyme. such unigenes may represent different fragments of a single transcript, different members of a gene family, or both. additionally, eighty-five unigenes for cyp <dig> gene and ninety unigenes for udpg were also discovered . all these unigenes are important resources for s. grosvenorii genetic engineering work in future. these results also demonstrated the powerful ability of high-throughput sequencing to identify genes in metabolic pathways.

changes in gene expression profiles during different developmental stages
dge generates absolute rather than relative gene expression measurements and avoids many of the inherent limitations of microarray analysis. dge was used to analyze the gene expression during three stages of s. grovenorii fruit development. three dge libraries:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daf, were sequenced that generated between  <dig>  to  <dig>  million high quality tags and the number of tag entities with unique nucleotide sequences ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the distributions of total tags and distinct tags over different tag abundance categories are shown in additional file  <dig>  the tag sequences were mapped to s. grosvenorii reference transcriptome database. between  <dig>  to  <dig>  distinct tags were mapped to a gene in the reference database and up to  <dig> %  of the sequences in transcriptome reference tag database could be unequivocally identified by unique tag .

differentially expressed tags between samples were identified by an algorithm developed by audic et al  <cit> . as expected the majority of gene expression changes occurred between the daf  <dig> and daf 50/daf  <dig>  with slightly more down-regulated genes observed. more than 40%-45% of the highly regulated genes were found to be orphan sequences - no homologues found in the ncbi database. this may indicate that s. grosvenorii fruit development contains many unique processes and pathways.

expression levels of putative genes involved in mogrosides biosynthesis
as shown in figure  <dig>  to examine the expression of the  <dig> genes putatively involved in mogrosides backbone biosynthesis revealed very low expression levels of aact, mvd, cmk, hds, sqs genes. the  <dig> remaining genes had significant expression levels that showed changes in gene expression during fruit development . between  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf, dxs, dxr, mcs, ids are down-regulated, whereas the remaining  <dig> genes are up-regulated. between  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf, hmgr, ids, ipi-i, ipi-ii, gps, fps and cas were found to be down-regulated, whereas, the other  <dig> genes were up-regulated. overall the trend between  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf was that dxr, mcs, ids, ipi -i showed decreased expression over time, while hmgs, hmgr, mk, pmk, mct, ipi-ii, gps, fps, sqs, cas, and cs genes showed degrees of up-regulation. sqe and cs genes were found to change the most in this period, . the rapid accumulation of mogroside v from  <dig> daf to  <dig> daf may result from the increase in expression of sqe and cs. sqe plays a key role in the cyclical transformation of squalene to  <dig>  3-oxidosqualene. the cyclization of  <dig>  3-oxidosqualene is the branch point of sterol and mogrosides biosynthesis and controls the carbon flux through the branched biosynthetic pathways. the next important step in the pathway is via cs and cas, which catalysis  <dig>  3-oxidosqualene formed cucurbitadenol and sterol respectively  <cit> . cucurbitadenol is the precursor of different mogrosides. to date, no genes involved in mogroside biosynthesis have been cloned from s. grosvenorii or other mogrosides-producing plants. the correlation between the expression of sqe and cs and the rapid formation of mogrol during fruit development presents a way of finding possible cyp <dig> and udpg genes involved in mogrosides biosynthesis via identification of candidate genes with similar expression profiles. this method of finding candidate genes has successfully identified a gene involved in saponin biosynthesis  <cit> .

candidate cyp <dig> enzymes involved in mogrosides biosynthesis
cyp <dig> proteins are the largest family of plant proteins and catalyze most of the oxidation steps in plant secondary metabolism  <cit> . in the biosynthetic pathway of mogrosides, the conversion from cucurbitadenol to mogrol is catalyzed by one or more cyp450s. a total of eighty-five unigenes were annotated as cyp450s in our s. grosvenorii transcriptome . to find the cyp450s putatively involved in mogrosides biosynthesis, these unigenes expression profiles were compared to sqe and cs by dge . from  <dig> daf to  <dig> daf, the sqe and cs genes are up-regulated, and so only cyp450s that displayed some up-regulation during this developmental period were considered candidates for mogrosides biosynthesis. a total of seventeen cyp450s that were found to be differentially expressed between at least one of the three developmental time points were chosen, and their expression profiles hierarchically clustered with that of sqe and cs . seven candidate cyp450s were found to cluster closely with either sqe or cs : unigene <dig>  accession number jl554661), unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> , unigene <dig>  and unigene <dig> . these genes are therefore promising candidates that may catalyze the oxidation of cucurbitadinol and the formation of mogrol.

candidate udpg enzymes involved in mogrosides biosynthesis
glucosyltransferases  are another large multi-gene family in plants. in general, glycosylation is the last step in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and sugar conjugation results in both increased stability and water solubility  <cit> . the s. grosovenorii cdna library contained seventy-two glycosyltransferase and ninety glucosyltransferase unigenes . only glucosyltransferases not glycosyltransferases, which used glucose as the donor and mogrol as the acceptor, catalyzed the formation of mogrosides. similar to the candidate cyp450s,  <dig> differentially expressed udpgs that showed up-regulation of gene expression during fruit development were selected and their expression profiles hierarchically clustered with that of sqe and cs . the expression pattern of five udpgs showed strong correlation to that of sqe and cs  and appear the best udpgs candidates for encoding the enzymes responsible for mogrosiedes biosynthesis. these udpgs consisted of unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> , and unigene <dig> .

discussion
est analysis is one of the most valuable tools for gene discovery. however, until the advent of ngs, significant coverage of the transcriptome was labor intensive and expensive. therefore, est analyses tended to identified only a few candidate genes involved in complex biosynthetic pathways such as that observed from studies in panax quinquefolius and panax ginseng  <cit> . even in combination with subtracted cdna libraries strategies in s. grosvenorii, traditional est sequencing only identified one cyp <dig> and two glycosyltransferases  and none potentially involved in mogrosides biosynthesis . the development of ngs has removed these limitations, and a number of successful identifications of secondary metabolism genes from plants with little genomics sequence information including cotton  <cit> , american ginseng  <cit> , glycyrrhiza uralensis  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , huperzia serrata and phlegmariurus carinatus  <cit>  have been performed.

despite the commercial and medicinal importance of s. grosvenorii, molecular information on this species is lacking preventing analysis of the mogrosides biosysnthetic pathway. creating a cdna library from the s. grosvenorii fruit and performing rna-seq and dge provided a very efficient means for identifying the genes associated with known enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and for providing candidate genes that could be associated with currently unknown steps in the pathway. thus, candidates for all of the known genes encoding enzymes involved in mogrosides backbone biosynthesis, including two  <dig>  3-oxidosqualene cyclases: cas and cs were identified in this study. very little is known about the late stages of mogrosides biosynthesis. this part of the pathway includes multiple oxidation and glycosylation steps catalyzed by enzymes from the cyp <dig> and glucosyltransferase superfamilies, respectively. these families of enzymes display a wide range of substrate specificities and are responsible for the diversity of many plant secondary metabolites. for example, approximately one hundred and twenty ugt genes and two hundreds and seventy-two cyp <dig> genes were identified in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. because of the biological, pharmacological, and agricultural importance of secondary metabolites, ugts and cyp450s have attracted considerable interest for decades, but only a few have been characterized by traditional biochemistry and genetics. to date, only two cyp450s involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis are functionally characterized: a β-amyrin 11-oxidase from glycyrrhiza uralensis  <cit>  and a β-amyrin and sophoradiol 24-hydroxylase from glycine max  <cit> . also, five ugts in triterpene saponin biosynthesis have been identified: soybean  <cit> , ugt73k <dig>  ugt71g <dig> and ugt73f <dig> from medicago truncatula  <cit>  and ugt74m <dig> from saponaria vaccaria  <cit> . genomic and co-expression analyses by dna microarray provide a basis for future studies to define genetically the roles of multiple cytochromes p <dig> and glycosyltransferases in triterpene saponin biosynthesis in model plant medicago truncatula. ugt73f <dig> have been identified for glucosylating hederagenin at the c <dig> position  <cit> . however, all of the aforementioned enzymes are involved in soyasapogenol and oleanane-type ginsenoside biosynthesis. no cyp450s or ugts in the cucurbitane-type mogrosides biosynthetic pathway have been previously functionally characterized. therefore, this study focused on the discovery of cyp450s and ugts involved in the biosynthesis of cucurbitane-type mogrosides, which are the major mogrosides type in the s. grosvenorii fruit.

in the cucurbitane-type mogorisdes biosynthetic pathway, cyp450s catalyze the c <dig> and c <dig> hydroxylation of cucurbitadienol, while glycosylation generally occurs on c <dig> and c <dig> of the aglycones. in total, eighty-five cyp <dig> unigenes and ninety udpg unigenes were found in the s. grosvenorii cdna library. however, the large number of candidate genes produced by ngs leads to difficulty in the characterization of the enzymes that are actually involved in this pathway. one cyp <dig> and four udpg were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis through a methyl jasmonate  inducibility experiment and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis based on ngs and real-time pcr assay  <cit> . three cyp <dig> enzymes and six ugts were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis by the same approach  <cit> . the real-time pcr method is time-consuming and labor intensive, as it can only study a few genes at the same time. dna microarrays are mainly used in model plants as they generally require either extensive gene sequence information or large scale amplification of cdna libraries. unfortunately, there is little information about gene cloning and est in ncbi database in s. grosvenorii. in contrast, the dge method based on high-throughput sequencing technology in combination with ngs transcriptome information, is more suitable and affordable for tens of thousands gene expressions studies at once. therefore, in this study, the dge of three different development stages were carried out to try to select those cyp450s and ugts most likely to be involved in mogrosides biosynthesis. the expression levels of  <dig> genes involved in mogrosides backbone biosynthesis all showed some variation in expression pattern through dge analysis. among these, sqe and cs genes in late steps changed the most. they increased  <dig>  times and  <dig>  times respectively from  <dig> daf to  <dig> daf, increased  <dig>  times and  <dig>  times respectively in  <dig> daf vs.  <dig> daf. mogroside v is the main constituent of ripe fruits, while mogroside iii and ii e are the leading components in unripe fruits  <cit> . at the early growing stage , mogroside v increases from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, then increases rapidly to  <dig> %  from  <dig> daf to  <dig> daf and gets stability at  <dig> % after  <dig> daf. therefore levels of sqe and cs gene expression levels are coincident with mogroside v content. selecting sqe and cs as reference expression patterns for cyp450s and udpgs that would be functional at the same development periods, similar to the work on saponin biosynthesis  <cit> , identified only seven cyp450s and five udpgs candidates. the function of these candidate cyp450s and udpgs will be confirmed by heterologous expression in escherichia coli or yeast, and in vitro enzymatic assay.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the feasibility of using combination of rna-seq and dge to provide a method for identifying and studying the genes involved in secondary metabolism not only in s. grosvenorii but also other non-model medicinal plants. candidate genes encoding enzymes potentially involved in mogrosides backbone biosynthesis as well as cyp <dig> and udpg genes likely to be involved in mogrosides biosynthesis were rapidly identified by this approach.
