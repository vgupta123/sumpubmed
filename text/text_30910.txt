BACKGROUND
cynara cardunculus l.  is an allogamous species native to the mediterranean basin, belonging to the family asteraceae, order asterales. the species includes three subspecies: the globe artichoke , which is grown for its edible immature inflorescence; the cultivated cardoon , which produces fleshy stalks; and their common ancestor, the wild cardoon  fiori)  <cit> . leaf extracts contain molecules of some pharmaceutical interest, including antibacterial  <cit>  antioxidative  <cit>  anti-hiv  <cit> , hepatoprotective, choleretic  <cit> , cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitory  <cit>  and anticancer  <cit>  activities. many of these properties rely on specific phenylpropanoids , particularly 5-caffeoylquinic acid  and di-caffeoylquinic  acids, along with various flavonoid compounds  <cit> . the level and composition of the pp pool can vary considerably between organisms, tissues, developmental stages and in response to environmental conditions  <cit> . pp metabolism is induced by biotic and abiotic stresses such as wounding, uv-irradiation and pathogen attack  <cit> . recently, moglia et al.  <cit>  have established that uv-c radiation enhances the level of caffeoylquinic acid in the globe artichoke.

the cga biosynthesis pathway has been the target of some detailed research, mainly focused among solanaceae species  <cit>  . even though little direct information is as yet available concerning the biosynthesis of di- and tri-caffeoylquinic acid, the prior accumulation of cga does appear to be necessary. three distinct pathways have been proposed for the synthesis of cga:  the trans-esterification of caffeoyl-coa and quinic acid via hydroxycinnamoyl-coa:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase  activity  <cit> ;  the hydroxylation of p-coumaroyl quinate to cga  <cit> ; and  the hydroxylation of p-coumaroyl shikimate to caffeoyl shikimic acid, which is then converted to caffeoyl-coa, a substrate of hydroxycinnamoyl-coa:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase hct  <cit> . the silencing of the hqt gene in tobacco and tomato results in a 98% reduction in cga level, but does not affect lignin formation, so in these species at least, the first two of these routes are probably responsible for the biosynthesis and accumulation of cga  <cit> . on the other hand, a lowered hct expression in tobacco  <cit> , pinus radiata  <cit>  and medicago sativa  <cit>  changes lignin amount and composition, thereby implicating the third pathway in lignin biosynthesis. a fourth route, which uses caffeoyl-glucoside as the active intermediate, has been described in sweet potato  <cit> . although the globe artichoke hct sequence is similar to that of tobacco hct, its activity is more closely related to that of tobacco and tomato hqt, in showing a preference for quinic over shikimic acid as acceptor  <cit> .

linkage maps, created for genes in biosynthetic pathways in several species, can be used to locate known genes of a pathway within a specific genomic region.  <cit> . the presence of allelic variation at the sequence level in genes of known biochemical functional is useful for candidate gene approaches  <cit> . genetic maps of globe artichoke  <cit>  have been based on observed segregation behaviour in an f <dig> population formed by the intercrossing of the two contrasting varieties 'romanesco c3'  and 'spinoso di palermo' .

here, we report the isolation of the cdna of a novel acyltransferase involved in c. cardunculus pp biosynthesis, and assess its leaf expression level as induced by uv-c irradiation. we also derive the map location of this gene, along with that of the hct gene described by comino et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
isolation and cloning of a full length hqt cdna of globe artichoke and cardoon
codehop  <cit>  was used to target conserved acyltransferases in globe artichoke , resulting in the amplification of an incomplete internal acyltransferase-like sequence, which was extended in both globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon via a race strategy. full-length cdna sequences have been deposited in genbank . the genes are of identical length  and their translation product is a  <dig> residue peptide with a molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda. the best matches obtained from a local alignment search within a non-redundant protein database  were with a sweet potato hcbt , and a tobacco hqt , which belongs to a multifunctional superfamily of plant acyltransferases  <cit> . the sequences contain a htlsd peptide , as does the hct isolated by comino et al.  <cit> , matching the highly conserved hxxxd motif characteristic for acyl transfer proteins. the dfgwg block  <cit>  present in other acyltransferases of the bahd family  <cit>  is present from aa  <dig> to  <dig> . phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the isolated sequence showed a high degree of similarity with other already isolated hqt sequences  <cit>  and with hcts from globe artichoke  <cit> , coffee  <cit> , tobacco and arabidopsis  <cit>  .

heterologous expression of globe artichoke hqt in e. coli and enzyme assays
the globe artichoke acyltransferase cdna was cloned and expressed in e. coli, using a pet3a expression vector. sds-page analysis demonstrated the presence of a heterologous protein of apparent molecular mass ~ <dig> kda  both in the supernatant and in the pellet fraction. this protein was absent from the equivalent fractions of cultures of bacteria carrying an empty pet3a plasmid. the recombinant enzyme was incubated in the presence of p-coumaroyl-coa or caffeoyl-coa and quinic acid or shikimic acid as substrates, and the products of the reactions were analyzed by hplc. in the presence of active enzyme, new products  were detected in the reaction mixtures containing p-coumaroyl-coa or caffeoyl-coa and quinic acid. these products could not be detected when reactions were performed with the control crude extract . no significant peaks were detected after addition of shikimic acid instead of quinic acid in the reaction mixture.

each reaction product was identified by comparing its retention time and absorbance spectrum with authentic samples or isolated compounds previously characterized. the ability of the isolated acyltransferases to catalyse the reverse reaction  was also successfully achieved, as has been described in other systems  <cit> . caffeoyl-coa was detected when cga was incubated with coenzyme a in the presence of the recombinant protein , whereas no metabolic product was detected from cultures carrying an empty plasmid.

real-time pcr
in order to assess the involvement in the response to uv-c irradiation, the expression levels of hqt and hct were analysed by real-time pcr. based on normalized levels , it was clear that uv-c treatment induced a significant increase in transcription . comparison between the standard curves for each enzyme revealed a correlation coefficient of >  <dig>  and an efficiency  >  <dig>  .

linkage analysis
two single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified  in the hqt and hct parental sequences. both parents of the mapping population were heterozygous for marker hqt-snp <dig> , that segregated in the ratio 1:2: <dig>  in the f <dig> individuals, with no evidence of any segregation distortion . this allowed the hqt gene to be placed on linkage group   <dig> in both the female and male maps . a further  <dig> markers were assigned to the female lg5: four microsatellites , three s-saps  and  <dig> aflps, covering  <dig>  cm and a mean inter-marker distance of  <dig>  cm. more than 70% of intervals are <  <dig> cm in genetic length, with four gaps of >  <dig> cm. in addition to the hqt locus, the male lg <dig> consists of  <dig> markers: two ssrs  one s-sap, one m-aflp  and  <dig> aflps, spanning  <dig>  cm and a mean inter-marker distance of  <dig>  cm . seven markers  were shared between the parents, allowing the alignment of their lg <dig>  the hqt locus maps close to aflp markers e38/m47- <dig> and e47/m49- <dig> in the female map, and to the m-aflp marker polyga/e33- <dig> and the microsatellite celms- <dig> in the male map .

only the female parent was heterozygous at hctsnp <dig>  delivering a segregation ratio of 1: <dig> with no significant distortion . as a result, the hct gene could only be located on the maternal map, where it maps to lg <dig>  separated by  <dig> cm from the aflp locus p12/m61- <dig> and by  <dig> cm from the ssap locus cyre5/m47- <dig> . a further six markers are present on this  <dig>  cm lg, including one ssr , two m-aflps  and three aflps. the marker density is  <dig>  cm , with two gaps of >  <dig> cm.

discussion
plants synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites, which function as uv protectants, phytoalexins, flower pigments, signalling molecules and building blocks for lignin. some have significance in the area of human health, both as 'phytomedicines', which target specific health problems, and/or as 'nutraceuticals', which provide long term nutritional benefit  <cit> . particular plant pps have been associated with anti-oxidant, estrogen-like and vasodilatory activity, while others have proven anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer chemopreventive action  <cit> 

cga is the most widespread plant pp. progress is being made in relation to the definition of its biosynthetic pathway, with the characterisation of two acyltransferases  able to synthesize p-coumaroylshikimate and p-coumaroyl quinate esters and a cytochrome p <dig> p-coumaroyl ester 3'-hydroxylase  from a p-coumaroyl ester substrate  <cit> .

the major phenolic compounds present in the leaves of the globe artichoke are the dcqs, and their precursor cga. although there is no firm proof as yet that dcq originates from cga, the structural similarity of the two molecules makes this rather likely. a globe artichoke acyltransferase involved in pp synthesis responded to both p-coumaroyl-coa and caffeoyl-coa esters as acyl donors  <cit> .

in the present study, we have described c. cardunculus sequences carrying peptide motifs characteristic of the plant acyltransferase family. these sequences cluster within the n-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase group  <cit>  and are closely related to their tobacco and tomato orthologues. the hydroxycinnamoyltransferase activity of the enzyme and its involvement in pp biosynthesis have been confirmed by heterologous expression assays, which showed that it can use either p-coumaroyl-coa or caffeoyl-coa esters as an acyl donor, and can use quinic acid as an acceptor. as the hqt gene product failed to utilize shikimic acid, we believe that it is involved in the transesterification of caffeoyl-coa and quinic acid, a reaction which occurs in the first route of cga biosynthesis, but also at the end of the third pathway, following the action of hct and c3'h resulting in the formation caffeoyl-coa.

pp metabolism can be induced by the application of abiotic stresses  <cit>  and it has been shown that pp leaf content of globe artichoke mostly responds to uv-c irradiation, as compared to other treatments such as methyljasmonate and salicylate that are inactive  <cit> . here, we have investigated the effect of uv-c irradiation on the transcription level of the hct and hqt genes involved in the caffeoylquinic acid pathway. the transcription of both genes was induced by uv-c, suggesting their involvement in the higher production of pps observed as the response to this stress. previous work on globe artichoke demonstrated that uv-c application led to large increases of leaf dcqs whereas no significant effect was observed on cga  <cit> . on the basis of our data this might be a consequence of the rapid conversion of cga to dcqs as by means of an unknown downstream enzymatic step. indeed the involvement of the hqt gene in the profile of phenolic acids accumulated can influence the kind of response to the uv stress as reported in a previous study on tomato by clè et al.  <cit> .

the genetic mapping of biosynthetic pathway genes of known biochemical function can help unravel the complexity of plant secondary metabolism. the precision of both marker order and inter-marker distances on lg <dig> and lg <dig> have been improved with the integration of the hqt and hct genes. the former increased the number of bridge markers on lg <dig>  and reduced some large gaps  affecting the female and the male lgs . its incorporation has caused some readjustment in the marker orders and inter-marker distances determined previously  <cit> . thus in the female lg, the order of celms <dig> and e38/m47- <dig> was inverted, as were those of celms- <dig>  e35/m62- <dig> and pga/e33- <dig>  p13/m60- <dig> on the male lg. the placement of the hct gene on female lg <dig> did not increase the number of bridge markers, nor did it affect marker order. however, it did succeed in filling a large  gap, and in reducing the mean inter-marker distance. increasing marker density by the addition of genes to a map can be accomplished via the exploitation of mapping populations which segregate for traits and markers in common across the populations  <cit> . we are currently constructing further genetic maps based on combinations between 'romanesco c3' and either cultivated or wild cardoon accessions, primarily as a means of initiating comparative qtl mapping. within gene markers, such as the ones described here for the hct and hqt genes, are particularly suitable for general mapping, and should prove useful as anchor points among diverse populations.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of cga in globe artichoke has been isolated and characterized. its activity and involvement in cga biosynthesis have been confirmed by heterologous expression assays, demonstrating that it can use either p-coumaroyl-coa or caffeoyl-coa as an acyl donor, and quinic acid as an acceptor. we previously observed that the pp metabolism can be induced by uv-c irradiation, whose effect on the transcription level of the hct and hqt genes has been investigated. the hqt as well as hct genes have been located in our previously developed globe artichoke genetic maps; the linkage analyses of genes having known biochemical function can help elucidate the complexity of plant secondary metabolism.

this work is a further contribution in the understanding of the genetic basis of phenylpropanoid  biosynthesis in c. cardunculus; our future research activity will be focused on the analysis of the expression in vivo of both hqt and hct, as well as on isolating further acyltransferases involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway of the species.
