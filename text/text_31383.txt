BACKGROUND
the tertiary structure of proteins provides crucial information for understanding molecular mechanisms of biological functions. protein structures also serve as a platform for various branches of biotechnology, including drug design
 <cit>  and protein engineering
 <cit> . although protein structures have been solved by experiments at an increasing rate, a flood of new sequences have been determined even more rapidly due to the advance of sequencing technologies
 <cit> . taking advantage of the enlarging database of experimentally solved protein structures
 <cit> , it is expected that computational structure prediction methods, especially template-based methods, will play a more significant role in providing structure of newly sequenced proteins
 <cit> . however, computing accurate structure models is still not always possible especially when template structures available do not share significant sequence similarity to a target sequence
 <cit> . template-based structure prediction methods usually employ structure-based scoring terms together with sequence matching terms to enhance structure recognition and alignment accuracy
 <cit> . structure-based terms used include secondary structure prediction
 <cit> , main-chain angle propensity
 <cit> , burial/exposure status
 <cit> , residue depth
 <cit> , and the number of residue contacts
 <cit>  for each amino acid. these structure-based terms are commonly derived from statistics of structural properties observed in representative structures . among various structure-based terms, residue-residue contact potentials
 <cit>  are unique in that they capture long-range interactions in a protein structure
 <cit> . a proper encoding of residue contact information is crucial for structure prediction because in principle, a full distance map or a residue contact map has sufficient information for reconstructing the tertiary structure of a protein
 <cit> . it has been also shown that a certain fraction of errors or missing contacts are tolerated for modeling the native structure of proteins
 <cit> . when contact information is used as constraints in an “ab initio” structure prediction method, even very sparse information of residue contacts, for example, a contact for every eight residues in a protein sequence is sufficient to reconstruct the native structure
 <cit> . correct identification of residue contacts is also important for template-based structure prediction since contact maps are usually well conserved between proteins of the same fold even at a very low sequence identity
 <cit> . there are two strategies of using residue contact information for structure prediction. one is to predict residue contact from a protein sequence
 <cit>  and use them as constraints or as an additional scoring term in a structure prediction procedure
 <cit> . the other approach is to employ a knowledge-based statistical residue contact potential to take into account general propensity of residue interactions. various types of contact potentials have been proposed and applied for protein structure prediction
 <cit> . they share the same principle but vary in details of their designs. for example, they differ in the definition of residue contacts, the reference state, whether or not to consider dependency to the distance and orientation. there are also contact potentials that consider more than two residues that are in contact
 <cit> . here, we examined various definitions of residue contacts to identify the most effective definitions in the context of fold recognition. in contrast to the previous works that evaluated contact maps in terms of the accuracy of protein structure reconstruction
 <cit> , we examine definitions of residue contacts that can effectively distinguish proteins of the same fold from those of the other folds. thus, information contained in residue contacts that are specific to each protein fold is evaluated in purely a practical scenario of the fold recognition.

concretely, we prepared  <dig> different contact definitions that consist of combinations of three different contacting atoms, i.e. cα, cβ, and heavy atoms with  <dig> distance cutoffs. using the  <dig> different contact definitions, we examined how well contact maps defined by each definition can distinguish proteins of the same fold from others. the similarity of contact maps of two proteins is defined as the fraction of the common contacts between the two proteins, where equivalent residues are identified either by structural superimposition or a threading method. the purpose of using threading methods is to simulate the actual situation of threading where an alignment between a query sequence and a template structure is not always accurate. we found that  <dig> / <dig>  Å,  <dig> / <dig>  Å, and  <dig> / <dig>  Å perform best for the distance cutoff of contact definition using cα, cβ, and heavy atoms, respectively, for identifying protein pairs of the same fold. these cutoffs worked consistently well when threading-based alignments were used for identifying equivalent residues in protein pairs. on average, contact maps effectively distinguish proteins of the same fold from others when contacting residue pairs occupy  <dig>  –  <dig> % of the whole contact maps. we also found that effective contact definitions differ from fold to fold, suggesting that using different residue contact definition specific for each template will lead to improvement of threading performance.

RESULTS
structural retrieval performance using different contact definitions
in figure
 <dig> we show structural retrieval performance by considering the fraction of common contacts  of protein pairs, which is computed using  <dig> different residue contact definitions. for a protein fold, protein pairs within the same fold and across different folds were ranked according to their fcc values, with which roc curves were plotted. to identify equivalent residues between proteins, we used tm-align
 <cit> , a structural superimposition program , as well as two threading methods, hhpred
 <cit>   and suprb
 <cit>  . the  <dig> different contact definitions consist of  <dig> distance cutoffs  for distances between cα-cα, cβ–cβ, and heavy atoms of residue pairs. 

when equivalent residues between structure pairs were correctly identified by structural alignments  and thus fcc was accurately computed, distant cutoffs of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å, and  <dig>  Å showed best discrimination between within- and across-fold pairs for the cα-cα , the cβ-cβ , and the heavy atom  distances, respectively. area under curve  for them were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the other similar cutoffs showed slightly worse but comparable auc: for the cα-cα distance, both  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å obtained auc of  <dig> . for the cβ-cβ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  auc, respectively. for the heavy atom distance,  <dig>  Å showed  <dig>  auc. proteins in the same fold become less distinguishable when smaller or larger distance cutoffs were used for residue contact patterns. for the cα-cα or the cβ-cβ distances, auc of roc curves quickly decreased when the  <dig> Å or larger cutoff was used, reaching to the random retrieval at  <dig> Å or higher. using a smaller cutoff,  <dig>  Å, also deteriorated the retrieval since contact maps became too sparse . using the heavy atom distance, the  <dig>  Å cutoff had the highest auc value. the average occupancy of contact maps with the heavy atom distance of  <dig>  Å is  <dig> %. this value is comparable to those of the best contact cutoffs for the cα-cα distance  <dig> Å and for the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å, which are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. later we will investigate the relationship of the occupancy of contact maps and the auc values more thoroughly. the auc values by best performing definitions are summarized in table
 <dig>  in terms of the auc, cβ  <dig>  Å achieved the highest value , although best performing cutoffs for cα and cβ showed similar values  .

structure retrieval with common contacts when threading alignments were used
the middle and the right column in figure
 <dig> show structure retrieval results obtained when the threading methods, hhpred  and suprb , were used to correspond residues of protein pairs to compare contact maps. the purpose of employing the threading methods is to introduce realistic errors in alignments of protein pairs, which are expected in actual threading process. overall, lower auc values were observed when threading methods were used relative to the cases when structural alignments were used  for identifying equivalent residues. this deterioration of auc values is due to the inaccuracy in the threading alignments. as shown in figure
 <dig>  the alignment accuracy  and the fcc values correlate with each other for proteins of the same fold. the pearson’s correlation coefficients for hhpred  and suprb  are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. thus, the more accurate the alignment is for a protein pair in the same fold, the higher fcc is obtained, which will be better distinguished from the background distribution of fcc of proteins of different folds. roc curves for hhpred  showed higher aucs than those of suprb . this is also explained by the higher alignment accuracy by hhpred than suprb. as shown in figure
 <dig>  in most of the cases, alignments by hhpred are more accurate than those by suprb. the average accuracy of alignments of proteins in the same fold by hhpred and suprb is  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. in the parentheses, accuracy was shown when residues aligned within two residues from the correct position are counted as accurate. for  <dig> % of the alignments, hhpred results were more accurate than suprb. when the accuracy calculation is relaxed to ± <dig> residues,  <dig> % of the alignments by hhpred results were more accurate. turning our attention back to figure
 <dig>  the best performing distance cutoffs for hhpred  and suprb  are consistent with those found for the structural alignments. in all the cases,  <dig> / <dig> / <dig> / <dig>  Å,  <dig> / <dig> / <dig> Å,  <dig> / <dig> Å showed the largest auc for the cα-cα, the cβ-cβ, and the heavy atom distances. a qualitative difference of the roc curves for hhpred/suprb is that larger distance cutoffs performed well at a similar level as the best performing distance cutoff compared with the roc curves for tm-align . for example, the  <dig> Å cutoff for the cα-cα and the cβ-cβ distance performed similarly to the  <dig>  Å cutoff in the case of hhpred/suprb, which was not observed for tm-align. also, the heavy atom distance  <dig>  Å performed clearly better than  <dig>  Å in tm-align alignments, but quite similarly in the two threading methods. this is because residue contacts identified under a strict definition tend to be easily missed when incorrect alignments by threading methods are used. on the other hand, contact patterns defined with a larger distance cutoff are more tolerant to residue shifts in threading alignments. the same analysis of structure recognition was performed on the superfamily dataset, which gave consistent results . since they gave quite similar results, below we will only discuss the results obtained for the fold level dataset.

contact map occupancy
apparently, contact maps lose fold-specific information if residue contacts are defined with a too short or a too long distance cutoff because maps become too sparse or dense with contacts. to examine how the occupancy of contact map affects the fold retrieval accuracy, we plotted the average auc values relative to the occupancy of contact maps computed using different distance cutoffs for three different contact bases and the three alignment methods . the occupancy  of a contact map is defined as the fraction of residue pairs in contact among all the pairs of residues in the map. for each combination of a contact base and an alignment method, the highest auc was observed when the occupancy is at  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the average auc slowly drops as the fraction of residue contacts further increases and reaches to random retrieval level when 30-40% of residue pairs are defined as in contact.

structural retrieval evaluated with tm-score
we have also evaluated the retrieval performance in terms of the structural similarity of the top ranked protein pairs. in figure
 <dig>  the best tm-score of protein pairs up to certain ranks are plotted using the contact maps of a subset of residue contact definitions as figure
 <dig> . the relative performance of each distance cutoff is essentially consistent with the roc curves in figure
 <dig>  using  <dig>  Å and  <dig> Å for the cα-cα and the cβ-cβ distance and  <dig>  Å for the heavy atom distance retrieved structurally similar protein pairs at higher ranks than the other distant cutoffs. using distance cutoffs of  <dig> Å,  <dig> Å,  <dig> Å or larger for the cα-cα, the cβ-cβ, and the heavy atom distance did not yield protein pairs with significant structural similarity  within the earlier half of the ranks in the retrieval.

fold recognition using residue contacts of different sequence separation ranges
in figure
 <dig>  fold recognition was performed using residue contacts with different sequence separation ranges, contacting residue pairs that are separated by 5– <dig> residues on the sequence, 11– <dig>  and over  <dig> residues apart. the contact definition of cβ-cβ,  <dig>  Å was used, since it was one of the best performing definitions for the three alignment methods. interestingly, the largest auc value was achieved by using > <dig> contacts, consistently for tm-align, hhpred, and suprb alignments. auc values for 5– <dig>  11– <dig>  and > <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . this result indicates that long-range contacts are more informative for distinguishing folds.

fold recognition with relaxed contact matching
we further examined fold recognition with a relaxed definition of common contacts. a pair of residue contacts in two proteins are considered as common when they occur within ± <dig> residues to each other in a given structural alignment. although the results do not differ much from those by the original definition of common contacts, “blurring” contacts made fold recognition slightly worse for all three types of alignments. for tm-align alignments, auc decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the hhpred alignments and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the suprb alignments. the auc values are for the contact definition of cβ-cβ  <dig>  Å.

fold recognition for different structural classes
next, we examine the structure retrieval performance using fcc on four major fold classes separately, all-α class, all-β class, α/β class, and α + β class in the fold dataset . there are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> folds in each class, respectively. we used the contact definition of  <dig> Å for the cβ-cβ distance, since it is one of the best performing definitions in the previous experiments in figures
 <dig> and
 <dig>  figure
 <dig> shows that the structure retrieval performance varies for different fold class. when tm-align was used , folds in the α/β, and the β class are better distinguished than those in the α+β and the α class. however, trend is different for retrieval using fcc computed with the two threading methods, hhpred  and suprb . among the four classes, the all-β class performed worst. since we found that the retrieval results for the threading methods are largely affected by their alignment accuracy , in figure
 <dig> we examined the alignment accuracy by hhpred  and suprb  for the four fold classes. it is found that, consistent to the retrieval results in figure
 <dig>  all-β proteins show the lowest alignment accuracy by both hhpred and suprb. moreover, the overall order of the accuracies for the four fold classes is consistent with the structure retrieval performance shown in figure
 <dig>  thus, it is confirmed that the retrieval accuracy of fold classes reflects the alignment accuracy of proteins in each classes. figure
 <dig> shows four examples of poorly recognized folds using fcc computed with the threading methods. the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å was used for the contact threshold. the first three pairs  are from the all-β class while the last one is from the α/β class. proteins in the first example  have the immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold, which have two layers of β-sheets. the query  contains eight β strands and the template  has nine. tm-align aligned the two-layer structure correctly yielding an alignment with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> residues, which corresponds to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the length of 2h7wb and 1ifra, respectively. the rmsd was computed by the lga program
 <cit> . on the other hand, the two threading methods shifted alignment at the n-terminal region , which resulted in rmsds of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å by hhpred and suprb, respectively. the fcc values by tm-align, hhpred, and suprb are  <dig>  8%,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the second example  is proteins of the glycosyl hydrolase-fold. tm-align produced an alignment with a  <dig>  Å rmsd and fcc of  <dig> %, while the rmsds of hhpred and suprb alignments are  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å with fcc of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the third example  is a protein pair of the “common fold of diphtheria toxin/transcription factors/cytochrome f” fold, which have nine β strands forming two layers. tm-align captured the overall folds correctly with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å and a fcc of  <dig> %. on the other hand, hhpred and suprb misaligned the protein pair mainly at the first half of the proteins. this alignment error caused worse rmsds of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å and fcc values of  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the last example is a protein pair in the α/β class , the preatp-grasp domain fold. the structures of the proteins have a similar α/β/α three layer core. tm-align aligned each layer from the two proteins yielding an rmsd of  <dig>  Å and fcc of  <dig> %. however, hhpred and suprb shifted the whole alignment, resulting in rmsds of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, and fccs of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. these examples illustrate that the threading methods’ frequent mistakes of shifting β strands in their alignments, leading to failure of detecting conserved contact pattern of the proteins. 

best contact definitions for individual folds
up to this point, we examined the fold retrieval performance of the various contact definitions averaged over all folds in the dataset. in this section, we investigate best contact definitions for individual protein folds. different folds hold different conserved contact patterns. thus, residue contact definitions that achieve the best fold recognition for a certain fold may be different from the  <dig>  Å cβ-cβ distance that works best on average. for each fold, we selected a definition with the largest auc value in the fold retrieval among  <dig> different definitions. if more than one definition has the same auc value, then all of them are counted. a fold was not counted if its largest auc is less than  <dig> . figure
 <dig> shows the distributions of best performing contact definitions for folds for tm-align, hhpred, and suprb. when structure alignment by tm-align was used ,  <dig>  Å cβ-cβ distance worked best in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases .  <dig>  Å cα-cα distance came to the second  and  <dig>  Å heavy atom distance was the third . when hhpred was used for alignments , larger distances that did not appear for tm-align , i.e.  <dig> Å,  <dig> Å, and  <dig> Å for the cβ-cβ distance, performed best for some folds. for suprb , the distribution of the contact definitions is very different from that of tm-align. counts are more evenly distributed for different distance cutoffs. the largest counts were observed for the cα-cα distance  <dig>  Å , and the second and the third were the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å  and the heavy atom distance  <dig>  Å . why does the overall best definition not work well for some folds? figure
 <dig> illustrates when structures are better recognized by a contact definition that is different from the cβ-cβ distance  <dig> Å. the first example, 1h6wa, has a loosely packed c-terminal region . the best contact definition for this fold is the cβ-cβ distance of  <dig> Å when using tm-align. such a large cutoff produces a contact map that contains all contacts from the definition of the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å and additionally captures neighboring residues in the c-terminus, as shown in the contact map. although these “contacts” identified by the large distance cutoff are not physical interactions, characteristic structural information can be captured, which contributes for more accurate recognition of this fold. for the second example, 1gyob, the best contact definition was found to be  <dig> Å for the cα-cα distance. as shown is figure
11b, this definition covers all the contacts identified with the definition of cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å as well as important interaction between α helices and β strands . the latter two examples show the difference of fold recognition abilities by the cα-cα distance  <dig>  Å and the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å. the cα-cα distance of  <dig>  Å had the second largest count for tm-align  and hhpred  and the largest count for suprb . figure
11c shows a structure of intein-encoded homing endonuclease pi-pfui, ldq3a. the auc value using the cα-cα distance  <dig>  Å for this fold was  <dig>  while it was significantly worse,  <dig> , with the cβ-cβ distance of  <dig>  Å when tm-align was used for the structure alignment. contacts shown in red in the map are for residue pairs between three β strands , which are detected only by using the cα-cα distance  <dig>  Å. as illustrated by contacting residue pairs shown in magenta in the structure figure, these contacts are not detected by the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å because the side-chains are placed in opposite directions. in contrast, the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å performed better for capturing residue contacts between α helices for 1ogke . auc using the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å and the cα-cα distance  <dig>  Å for structural alignments were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. contacts colored in red in both the structure and the contact map are those which are captured uniquely by the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å but not cα-cα distance  <dig>  Å because they are too far for the latter.
 <cit> . the chain color, blue to red, shows the orientation of the chain from the n- to the c-terminus. a, 1h6wa. in the contact maps, black are contacts detected by both the cβ-cβ  <dig>  Å and the cβ-cβ  <dig> Å definitions; green and red are contacts dentified only by the latter definition. contacts in red in the map correspond to the residue pairs connected by red lines in the structure. b, 1gyoa. black are contacts detected by both the cβ-cβ  <dig>  Å and the cα-cα  <dig> Å; green and red are contacts identified only by the latter definition. c, 1dq3a. black are identified by both the cβ-cβ  <dig> Å and the cα-cα  <dig> Å; red and green contacts are identified only by the latter definition. two residues in magenta in the structure are in contact using the definition of the cα-cα  <dig>  Å but not by the cβ-cβ  <dig>  Å. d, 1ogke. black are those which identified by both the cβ-cβ  <dig>  Å and the cα-cα  <dig>  Å. on the other hand, contacts in purple and red are detected only by the former definition. contacts in green are unique to the latter definition

discussion
in this work, we tested thirty different residue contact definitions in the context of fold recognition. to investigate the pure ability of contact patterns for distinguishing folds, we introduced the fraction of common contacts  of protein pairs and examined how well fcc computed with different definitions select proteins of the same fold from the rest of the protein pairs of different folds. to examine how much incorrect alignments in threading affect the fold recognition accuracy, we also used two threading methods, hhpred and suprb, to determine corresponding residues of proteins. we found that overall, the cβ-cβ distance  <dig>  Å works best for identifying proteins of the same fold consistently for structural alignments and threading alignments. a qualitative difference between the threading alignments and structural alignments is that the former prefer larger distance cutoffs for defining contacts because they are more tolerant to misalignments . in the case of threading, alignment accuracy strongly influences the fraction of common contacts identified among proteins of the same fold , which eventually affects fold recognition accuracy . it turned out that threading alignment accuracy is relatively poorer for all-β proteins , and thus those proteins have lower fold recognition accuracy . finally, we found that the effective contact definition to identify folds depends on the folds . a larger distance cutoff is advantageous for capturing spatial arrangement of the secondary structures of a fold, which are not physically in contact. for capturing contacts between neighboring β strands, considering cα atoms is better than cβ, because sometimes the side-chains point to opposite directions . the results of this work suggest two potential directions of implementing residue contacts for improving fold recognition. since a larger distance cutoff is effective in capturing local topology of proteins, employing a “long-distance” interaction potential for residues that are  <dig>  Å to  <dig> Å apart may improve recognition accuracy. the long-distance interaction potential may be used as a scoring term in threading together with a regular contact potential . another idea is to use different fold-specific contact definitions  for each structure in a template database.

CONCLUSIONS
this study focused on seeking effective inter-residue contact definitions for template-based protein structure prediction. residue contacts defined by cβ−cβ distance of  <dig>  Å work best overall among tested to identify proteins of the same fold. we also found that effective contact definitions differ from fold to fold, suggesting that using different residue contact definition specific for each template will lead to improvement of the performance of threading.
