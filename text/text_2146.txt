BACKGROUND
carbonic anhydrase  is a zinc containing enzyme which catalyzes a reversible reaction to form bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and water  <cit> . by facilitating the interconversion between co <dig> and bicarbonate in vivo, ca activity was proposed to be required to ensure adequate level of co2or hco3- as the substrates for other enzymes  <cit> . therefore, cas have been found to play an essential role in a series of fundamental biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, ph homeostasis and ion transport  <cit> . based on the origins and structural features, cas are divided into six classes, termed α, β, γ, δ, ε and ζ, respectively  <cit> . the α-cas were found in mammals, algae and prokaryotes to facilitate the exchange of co <dig> in the respiratory cycle. the β-cas were characterized in higher plants, algae and prokaryotes, and those in higher plants have been reported to play a critical role during photosynthesis  <cit> . the γ-class was first identified in the thermophilic archaeon methanosarcina thermophila  <cit> , whereas δ-  <cit>  and ζ-  <cit>  class were found in diatom only. notably, the ε-cas from bacteria can form a carboxysome  <cit> .

the β-cas of known structure form a dimer, tetramer or octamer of identical subunits, with the active site located at the interface of two subunits. each subunit consists of three parts, an n-terminal arm composed of two or three projecting α-helices, a conserved zinc-binding core consisting of α-β-α units exhibiting a rossmann fold and an anti-parallel β-sheet and a c-terminal domain that is dominated by α-helices  <cit> . the n-terminal arm of one subunit makes significant contacts with another subunit via domain swapping. the overall structure of the zinc-binding core is relatively conserved, but the zinc-coordinating residues differ in various classes of ca. in β-ca, the zinc ion binds to two cysteines and a histidine, in addition to a water molecule or an aspartate as the fourth ligand. based on the divergence of the active site, β-cas were further grouped into two subclasses, the plant type and the cab type  <cit> .

the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single copy of ca, termed nce <dig> after the non-classical export pathway where it was identified for the first time  <cit> . deletion of nce <dig> leads to a growth-defect phenotype under aerobic conditions, but not under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . the Δnce <dig> strain exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to h2o <dig> compared to the wild type  <cit> . however, the restoration of Δnce <dig> is due to the recovery of carbonic anhydrase activity rather than antioxidant activity  <cit> . nce <dig> is an efficient β-ca who shows high co <dig> hydrase activity, with a kcat of  <dig>  ×  <dig> s- <dig> and kcat/km of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> s- <dig> <cit> .

nce <dig> contains all conserved residues of the active site in the plant type β-cas, and a relatively divergent n-terminal region . to verify if this n-terminal region is critical for the ca activity, we overexpressed and purified three versions of nce <dig>  full length, nce103Δn <dig> and nce103Δn <dig>  moreover, we determined the crystal structure of nce103Δn <dig> at  <dig>  Å resolution. structural analysis in combination with comparative activity assays revealed the n-terminal region comprising two α-helices is indispensable for controlling the substrate tunnel.

RESULTS
overall structure
we overexpressed, purified and crystallized the full length nce <dig>  but failed optimizing the crystal to diffraction quality. after performing a multiple sequence-alignment, we deduced the first non-conserved  <dig> residues of nce <dig> might interfere the crystal packing . thus, we constructed the truncated version nce103Δn <dig> which enabled us to determine its crystal structure at  <dig>  Å resolution.

the structure of nce103Δn <dig> resembles that of other plant type β-class cas . it comprises all the conserved active site residues  as found in the plant type cas. the overall structure of nce <dig> contains two molecules in an asymmetric unit . the missing electron density of the n-terminal 6× his-tag, residues his14-ser <dig> and pro41-gln <dig> of each subunit indicates their high degree of flexibility . similar to other β-cas, the nce <dig> monomer consists of three components: an n-terminal arm, a conserved α/β core and a c-terminal subdomain . the n-terminal arm is composed of two α-helices that extend away from the rest of the molecule, making extensive contacts with the other molecule in the asymmetric unit. the α/β core consists of a parallel four-strand β-sheet ordered β2-β1-β3-β <dig>  with a fifth anti-parallel strand β <dig> connected by a short turn. the c-terminal subdomain contains three projecting α-helices running on the surface of the α/β core.

two subunits form a very tight homodimer with a buried interface of  <dig>  Å <dig>  bringing the two zinc binding pockets close to each other. the juxtaposition of the two β <dig> strands at an angle of 120° results in the formation of an eight-strand β-sheet running through the core of the homodimer. via domain swapping, the n-terminal arm of one molecule reaches both the zinc binding core and the c-terminal subdomain of the second molecule in the asymmetric unit, creating a broad and deep groove. the overall structure of the homodimer is reminiscent of a saddle .

the zinc binding site
the active site is located at the inner side of the parallel β-sheet, thus largely sequestered from the solvent. each subunit contains a zinc ion that resides at the interface between two subunits, with three coordinating residues  from the same subunit, and a water molecule wat263a/wat260b as the fourth to complete the tetrahedral coordination . the average coordination bonds of the two zinc ions are  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å for cys57sγ, his112nε, cys115sγ and wat263a/wat260b, respectively. the four zinc ligands are stabilized by the surrounding residues via a number of hydrogen bonds: his112nγ~thr113o ; his112nε~wat267o; cys115sγ~gly117n and cys57sγ~asp59n. in addition, two conserved residues asp <dig> and arg <dig> form two hydrogen bonds: asp59oδ1~arg61nh <dig> and asp59oδ2~arg61nh <dig> 

an acetate molecule in the substrate binding pocket
a hydrophilic tunnel that passes a bottleneck consisting of phe <dig>  leu <dig>  gly <dig> and asp <dig> is the only access to the active site of nce <dig>  in the substrate binding pocket, there is a flat trilobed piece of density, reminiscent of an acetate molecule , which is an analog of the substrate bicarbonate as reported previously  <cit> . in both active sites of the two subunits, the acetate molecule is finely complementary to the pocket from both the viewpoints of shape and charge . moreover, the acetate is stabilized by five hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogens of residue gly <dig> and three water molecules . on the surface of the homodimer, there are four flat but slightly longer pieces of electron density which are well fitted with four molecules of ethylene glycol. both acetate and ethylene glycol were introduced during crystallization.

comparison between the active sites of nce <dig> and β-cas from other species
the crystal structure of nce <dig> was superimposed on three β-ca homologs from p. sativum , e. coli  and c. neoformans , giving a root mean squared deviation  of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively, for  <dig> cα-atoms. moreover, the zinc-coordinating residues  of nce <dig> and those of psca  superimpose well . besides in nce <dig>  an acetate molecule was also found in the active sites of psca and can <dig>  respectively. compared to that in psca , the acetate molecule  in nce <dig> is far away from the zinc ion . the fourth zinc ligand wat <dig>  of nce <dig> occupies the position of act'-o1' in psca, putting act away from the zinc ion . the distance between the acetate molecule and the zinc ion in nce <dig>  and that in subunit a in psca  are different, reminding us of the moving path of the substrate/product. in addition, a bicarbonate molecule was found in the noncatalytic binding site of ecca, which is at the opposite of the zinc ion  <cit> . as another notable difference, the density map of the residues pro <dig> to gln <dig> in nce <dig> is absent , whereas the counterparts in most β-cas of known structure are well ordered. however, superposition of these structures indicated that the loop adopts different conformations.

a proposed tunnel of substrate
using the program caver, we added hydrogen atoms to the nce <dig> structure and calculated a solvent accessible pathway starting from the acetate ion to the outside bulky solvent. the tunnel profile is a graph of cross section radius  versus tunnel length measured from its deepest place to the outside . we speculate that this calculated pathway can mimic the possible substrate diffusion tunnel  <cit> . the two tunnels in the homodimer point to the opposite directions towards the surface . it is worth noting that this tunnel is funnel-shaped, widely open toward the solvent but has a narrow gorge  in the vicinity of the acetate ion, suggesting that the linear co <dig>  molecule can freely diffuse toward the active sites, consistent with the diffusion-control catalytic mechanism of β-cas. the gorge of the funnel is lined by several hydrophobic residues  on one side and polar residues  on the other . the distribution of hydrophobic and polar residues creates an ideal microenvironment for the diffusion of both nonpolar co <dig> and negatively charged hco3-. furthermore, all these residues are highly conserved among β-cas from other species, suggesting a potential role of these residues in assisting the substrate approaching the active site .

activity assays indicated that the n-terminal arm of nce <dig> is indispensable
in the pathogenic fungus cryptococcus neoformans, the n-terminal domain of the β-ca  is formed by four antiparallel α-helices  <cit> . it is reported that the n-terminal extension has a strong interaction with a surface groove which is located on the top of the active site of an adjacent monomer within the dimer. so, the n-terminal extension might mediate a regulation mechanism or protein/protein interaction  <cit> . the shorter n-terminal extension of nce <dig> does not contain those residues necessary to interact with the active site in can <dig> . to further validate the putative contribution of the n-terminal arm to the activity of nce <dig>  we constructed another truncated version of nce <dig> which contains residues his51-lys <dig>  designated as nce103Δn <dig>  during purification, both nce103Δn <dig> and nce103Δn <dig> were not stable at ph  <dig>  , despite nce103Δn <dig> remained dimeric in solution. therefore, the nce <dig> homodimer is mainly sustained by the interactions of the hydrophobic groups of the zinc binding core, instead of the swapped n-terminal arms.

the activity of nce <dig>  nce103Δn <dig> or nce103Δn <dig> to catalyze the hydration of co <dig> at ph  <dig>  was determined using a colorimetric assay  <cit> . nce103Δn <dig> shows almost the same activity as the full length nce <dig>  whereas the activity of nce103Δn <dig> has been completely abolished . these results indicate that the first  <dig> residues are indispensable for the stability and activity of nce <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
carbonic anhydrase is an important enzyme in inorganic carbon utilization. here we provide the x-ray structure of s. cerevisiae β-carbonic anhydrase nce <dig> at  <dig>  Å resolution. the quaternary structure of nce <dig> resembles the typical β-cas of known structure. comparative structure analysis enabled us to find a possible moving path of the substrate analog acetate toward the active site, and to calculate a funnel-shaped tunnel for the diffusion of the substrate/product. furthermore, the activity assays indicated the n-terminal arm is indispensable for the enzymatic activity.
