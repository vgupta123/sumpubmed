BACKGROUND
nucleosomes are comprised of dna wrapped around histone proteins to form a stable chromatin structure. post translational modifications  of histones influence chromatin structure and the transcriptional state of genes  <cit> . histone acetylation, which is one of the earliest discovered histone ptms  <cit> , has been well established as a transcriptional activation mark  <cit> . the reverse, histone deacetylation, is correlated with transcription repression  <cit> . histone lysine acetyltransferases  and histone deacetylases  are key effectors conferring histone acetylation and deacetylation, respectively. these enzymes are often found in complexes where they associate with a scaffold protein and accessory factors. the accessory proteins are thought to finely tune the enzymatic activity of complexes  <cit> . one such multiprotein complex is the sin3/rpd <dig> hdac complex, in which sin <dig> acts as the master transcriptional adapter protein that interacts with the deacetylase rpd <dig> and other accessory proteins  <cit> . the primary role of the sin <dig> complex is to mediate gene repression, however, evidence of transcriptional activation promoted by sin <dig> has been documented .

sin <dig> activity is linked to several cellular processes throughout metazoan development. sin <dig> has been shown to be involved in protein stability, oncogenic transformations, senescence and cell survival  <cit> . sin <dig> is also implicated in cell cycle regulation. reduction of sin <dig> in drosophila s <dig> cells compromises the g2/m phase transition during cell cycle progression  <cit> . additionally, rna interference  mediated knockdown of sin3a causes curved wings in adult flies  <cit> . rescue of the curved wing phenotype by overexpression of string, a g2/m regulator, highlights the importance of sin <dig> in cell cycle progression  <cit> . in mouse, knockdown of msin3a impacts both g <dig> and g2/m phases of the cell cycle  <cit> . null mutants of sin <dig> in budding yeast show an accumulation of asynchronous cell population in the g <dig> phase  <cit> . sin <dig> has also been linked to metabolism. several metabolic processes including glucose metabolism, oxidative metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation as well as mitochondrial and cellular protein synthesis have been previously reported to be regulated by sin <dig> as determined by expression profiling of s <dig> and kc drosophila cell lines in which sin3a was knocked down  <cit> . in addition, studies in yeast and fly models indicate that sin <dig> plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress  <cit> . in mouse, two genes encode highly related sin <dig> proteins, msin3a and msin3b  <cit> . several investigators have shown that the two highly similar mouse sin <dig> proteins play distinct roles during development. for example, msin3a is essential for early embryonic development, survival and growth of cultured cells  <cit> , while msin3b plays a regulatory role during the late gestation period of embryogenesis, suggesting the functional non-redundancy of the msin <dig> genes  <cit> . despite being an area of active research, the complete array of functions and complexity of sin <dig> regulatory networks remains largely unknown.

the intricate mechanism of gene regulation by sin <dig> is augmented by the presence of distinct sin <dig> isoforms or discrete sin <dig> hdac complexes in multiple eukaryotic model systems  <cit> . in drosophila, splicing of a single gene results in the expression of multiple isoforms of sin <dig>  <cit> . additionally, subcomplexes of sin <dig> with and without rpd <dig> have been isolated  <cit> . unlike drosophila, saccharomyces cerevisiae express a single sin <dig> protein  <cit> . although a single protein is present, multiple complexes containing sin <dig> and rpd <dig> have been identified, suggesting a functional diversity of yeast sin <dig> hdac corepressor complexes. in budding yeast, rpd <dig> predominantly forms a large complex  and a small complex  . the core components of these complexes are sin <dig>  rpd <dig> and ume <dig>  interestingly, rpd3l acts as a corepressor at promoters of transcribed genes, while rpd3s suppresses cryptic transcription by recognizing set <dig> methylated histones in the gene body  <cit> . furthermore, several subcomplexes of msin3a and msin3b have been reported  <cit> . the distinct activities of the different sin <dig> complexes are an area of active research. taken together, these data confirm the presence of functional variations among sin <dig> hdac complexes in different model organisms.

previously, we demonstrated the existence of distinct sin <dig> hdac complexes in drosophila  <cit> . sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> are the most prevalent isoforms of sin <dig> expressed during fly development  <cit> . sin <dig>  <dig> is the predominantly expressed isoform in proliferative cells such as cultured drosophila s <dig> cells and larval imaginal disc cells, whereas sin <dig>  <dig> is the prevalent isoform during the latter stages of embryonic development and in adults  <cit> . additionally, expression of the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform was found to rescue lethality due to a genetic null allele, while sin <dig>  <dig> was essentially unable to suppress the lethal phenotype  <cit> . differential spatial and temporal patterns of expression of sin <dig> isoforms support the idea that they have distinct functions. recently, sin <dig>  <dig>  but not sin <dig>  <dig>  was found to play an active regulatory role in the mesoderm  <cit> , which is in accord with the expression of sin <dig>  <dig> in differentiated cells. taken together, results from our laboratory and others strongly suggest non-overlapping activity of sin <dig> isoforms in drosophila.

genome-wide binding sites of sin <dig> have been previously published by several groups  <cit> , however, no distinction between isoform specific genomic localization was indicated in those studies. to explore the functional differences of sin <dig> isoforms in modulating biological processes, we carried out genome-wide assays in drosophila cultured cells that predominantly express one or the other major isoform. to our knowledge, it is the first time the binding sites of sin <dig> isoforms across the drosophila genome have been mapped. interestingly, we found that overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig> led to replacement of sin <dig>  <dig> at a majority of the genomic sites, indicating that the binding sites of the sin <dig> isoforms overlap with each other. rna-seq analysis, however, demonstrate that sin <dig>  <dig> plays unique gene regulatory roles, in addition to having some functions in common with sin <dig>  <dig> 

RESULTS
to analyze gene regulatory activity of sin <dig> isoforms, we established two s <dig> cultured cell lines in which cells express either of the two major sin <dig> isoforms with a tag for immunoprecipitation . the predominantly expressed isoform of sin <dig> in s <dig> cells is sin <dig>  <dig> . to express sin <dig>  <dig> with an ha tag, a stable s <dig> cell line carrying a transgene with sin <dig> 220ha cdna was generated  <cit>  . in addition to the stable sin <dig> 220ha cell line, we also generated a stable cell line for expression of sin <dig> 187ha   <cit> . interestingly, overexpression of sin <dig> 187ha resulted in an almost complete reduction of sin <dig>  <dig>  when compared to s <dig> cells . these results indicate that the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform modulates the expression of sin <dig>  <dig>  important for this study, we have established a homogeneous cell culture system in which cells express almost exclusively one isoform or the other.fig.  <dig> expression of sin <dig>  <dig> affects levels of sin <dig>  <dig>  a schematic representing the different cell lines used in this study as well as the sin <dig> isoform expressed in that line. b western blot analysis of whole cell extract prepared from s <dig> cells, sin <dig> 220ha  and sin <dig> 187ha  cell lines. the expression of sin <dig>  <dig> with a c-terminal ha tag was driven by an inducible metallothionein promoter. due to leakiness of the metallothionein promoter, the maximum level of expression of sin <dig> 220ha was achieved without induction. the sin <dig> 187ha cell line was treated with  <dig>  m of cuso <dig> to induce the transgene. blots were probed with antibodies listed at the right. sin <dig> pan antibody recognizes all sin <dig> isoforms. * denotes degradation product of sin <dig> 220ha. β-actin or α-tubulin was used as a loading control. c, d chip was performed on chromatin prepared from s <dig> , sin <dig> 220ha  or sin <dig> 187ha  cells using antibody against the ha tag. immunoprecipitated dna was quantified by quantitative pcr . pcr amplification of chip dna was carried out using primers designed within 500 bp upstream or downstream of the transcription start site  of all genes. enrichment of sin <dig> isoforms at gene targets is represented as a mean value of the percent of input ± standard error of the mean from three independent biological replicates



utilizing this cell culture system, we first set out to study the binding of sin <dig> isoforms at putative gene targets, predicted from previous studies  <cit> . to confirm the localization of sin <dig>  <dig> to specific targets, we prepared chromatin from the sin <dig> 220ha cell line and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  using antibody against the ha tag followed by quantitative pcr . as predicted, chip-qpcr data showed the enrichment of sin <dig>  <dig> at putative gene targets supressor of hairless ), cytochrome c <dig> , pyruvate kinase , twine , cg <dig> but not at control regions dachsous  or cg <dig> . next, we sought to measure the binding of sin <dig>  <dig> to the predicted targets. we performed chip on chromatin prepared from the sin <dig> 187ha cell line using antibody against the ha tag. following induction of sin <dig> 187ha for 48 hr, we observed considerable enrichment of sin <dig>  <dig> at the same targets bound by sin <dig>  <dig> , suggesting that sin <dig>  <dig> is recruited to the same genes as those bound by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform. chromatin from the non-transfected s <dig> cell line was used as a non-specific chip control. as expected, little sin <dig> enrichment at any of the tested targets was observed in these control cells . we performed an additional chip-qpcr experiment using antibody that recognizes both sin <dig> isoforms. the results confirm the recruitment of sin <dig>  <dig> to sin <dig>  <dig> targeted genomic sites . based on the western blot analysis, we conclude that expression of sin <dig>  <dig> impacts the level of expression of sin <dig>  <dig>  additionally, following ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig>  sin <dig>  <dig> is replaced by sin <dig>  <dig> at the tested genes. most importantly, the chip-qpcr results demonstrate that we were able to effectively immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments bound by sin <dig> isoforms. next, using chip followed by deep sequencing, we set out to map the binding sites of sin <dig> isoforms across the entire drosophila genome at a high resolution.

sin <dig> isoforms bind to overlapping genomic targets
although genome-wide sin <dig> occupancy has been previously mapped  <cit> , the genes that are differentially bound by sin <dig> isoforms have not been determined. in the current study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing  from chromatin prepared from the stable cell lines that express either of the sin <dig> isoforms tagged with ha . we performed two independent biological replicates of the chip-seq experiment, for which we prepared separate sequencing libraries for sin <dig> 187ha and sin <dig> 220ha chip dna samples. additionally, we prepared separate libraries using input dna samples for each replicate. following sequencing of the chip samples, we used macs <dig> to call peaks at an irreproducible discovery rate  of  <dig>  . further, we retained only those peaks that were three fold or more enriched over the input sample.  <dig> and  <dig> peaks were called for the sin <dig>  <dig> and the sin <dig>  <dig> libraries, respectively. a comparison of sin <dig> isoform bound peaks in s <dig> cells with those of the binding sites of sin <dig> mapped previously in the drosophila embryos  <cit>  showed a substantial level of correlation  . this overlap between the occupancy of the sin <dig> isoforms in s <dig> cells in this study and published sin <dig> binding in drosophila embryos suggest that in the whole organism, sin <dig> isoforms are likely recruited to many genomic targets by a mechanism similar to that in s <dig> cells. additionally, the differences in the binding patterns suggest that there are tissue-specific binding sites for the isoforms.

through investigation of the chromosomal distribution of sin <dig> isoforms, we found that they are enriched over the euchromatic regions of the drosophila genome as determined by the cis-regulatory enrichment annotation system  analysis  <cit> . specifically, we found that 99 % of the peaks identified for sin <dig> isoforms were represented on the euchromatic arms of chromosome 2l, 2r, 3l, 3r and x . this result is in accord with sin <dig> binding at euchromatic regions in polytene chromosomes  <cit> . we found that a large majority of peaks of the sin <dig> isoforms localized around the transcription start sites  of genes, which suggests that both sin <dig> isoforms bind the promoter regions of genes to regulate transcriptional activity . we also note a slight enrichment of the sin <dig> isoforms around the transcription end sites  of genes. we do not rule out the possibility that some of these peaks may overlap with the promoter region of other closely localized genes. the peaks of sin <dig> binding were assigned to genomic features and grouped into eight categories . more than 50 % of the peaks were located within 1 kb upstream of the tss and 5’utr region. enrichment of sin <dig> isoforms beyond 1 kb upstream of the tss was observed but at a low level. we also note that sin <dig> isoforms were preferentially located over introns versus coding exons. very little or negligible binding of sin <dig> isoforms was observed at the 3’utr or distal intergenic regions.fig.  <dig> genome-wide occupancy profile of sin <dig> isoforms. a the chromosomal distribution of sin <dig> isoforms across the drosophila melanogaster genome as determined by the cis-regulatory element annotation system . the p-value represents the significance of relative enrichment over genome. it was calculated using a one-sided binomial test. b the metagene analysis of all peaks showing the enrichment of sin <dig> isoforms around the transcription start site  and the transcription end site . c bar plot representing the enrichment of sin <dig> isoforms over genomic features



the enrichment patterns of sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> at genomic features  are similar to each other . additionally, a comparison of chip-seq profiles of sin <dig> isoforms revealed that sin <dig> isoforms localize to overlapping genomic loci . we next directly compared the peaks identified for sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig>  we considered the peaks to be bound by sin <dig> isoforms as similar only if the sequence of overlap between the peaks was at least 50 %. using this criterion, we found 86 % of sin <dig>  <dig> peaks called overlapped with 73 % of sin <dig>  <dig> peaks, indicating that the majority of genomic sites targeted by sin <dig> isoforms are common . these data demonstrate that expression of sin <dig>  <dig> leads to its enrichment at the genomic targets that were previously bound by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform.fig.  <dig> sin <dig> isoform binding sites largely overlap. a binding of sin <dig> 187ha and sin <dig> 220ha are depicted as standard genomic tracks on the integrated genomic viewer. peaks were aligned to the built-in drosophila melanogaster gene annotation track, shown in blue. exons are shown in solid blue, introns as blue lines and arrows indicate the directionality of genes. sin <dig> 187ha and sin <dig> 220ha peaks as called by macs <dig> are displayed in dark green and dark orange bars, respectively, below their enrichment tracks. input tracks are shown in green for sin <dig> 187ha and orange for sin <dig> 220ha. all peaks shown are highly significant, p-value <1e- <dig>  b venn diagram showing the overlap of peaks between the sin <dig> 187ha and the sin <dig> 220ha chip-seq data. a minimum of 50 % overlap between peaks of the two sin <dig> isoforms was considered



our next goal was to identify genes that are possibly bound by sin <dig> isoforms. for this objective we assigned peaks to genes. if a peak under investigation mapped within 1 kb upstream of the tss and 100 bp downstream of the tes, it was assigned to that gene. therefore, a sample peak could be assigned to one or more genes, depending on the directionality and the distance between genes. utilizing this method, we extensively mapped the genes that are bound by sin <dig> isoforms. we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes bound by sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig>  respectively, supporting the idea of a global transcriptional role of sin <dig> isoforms. additionally, the chip-qpcr data showing localization of the sin <dig> isoforms at putative gene targets  were validated by the chip-seq results . taken together, our data demonstrate that sin <dig> isoforms are targeted to many overlapping genomic loci and a substantial enrichment of sin <dig> is observed around the tss. overall, these data are in accord with previous findings showing that sin <dig> localizes to euchromatic regions of the genome and the extent of sin <dig> binding to the drosophila genome supports previous results indicating that sin <dig> is a global transcriptional regulator  <cit> .

sin <dig>  <dig> directly regulates genes involved in metabolism and cell cycle progression
the high resolution chip-seq profile identified genomic targets of the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform. to investigate the genes regulated by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform, we performed transcriptome analysis by rna-seq on total mrna isolated from s <dig> cells treated with sin3a dsrna or gfp dsrna as a control. as sin <dig>  <dig> is the predominant isoform in s <dig> cells, we considered genes misregulated upon sin3a knockdown in s <dig> cells to be regulated by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform and we refer to these genes as sin <dig>  <dig> targets. efficient knockdown of sin3a was verified by western blot . for the expression profile we selected genes that showed a change in expression of ≥ <dig>  fold  for sin3a knockdown samples compared to gfp rnai samples. we identified  <dig> genes as misregulated upon reduction of sin3a in s <dig> cells .  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated upon sin3a knockdown. based on this rna-seq analysis, the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform acts as both a co-repressor, for those genes upregulated upon sin3a knockdown, and as a co-activator, for the genes demonstrating a decrease in expression following sin3a knockdown.fig.  <dig> chip-seq and transcriptome analysis reveal the genes directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  a western blot for sin <dig> of whole cell extracts prepared from gfp rnai or sin3a knockdown  cells. β-actin was used as a loading control. b scatter plot showing the correlation between genes bound by sin <dig> 220ha and those that change in expression following sin3a knockdown. green dots denote genes regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> but not bound. red dots indicate genes that are regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> and bound by both sin <dig> isoforms. black dots refer to genes uniquely bound and regulated by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform. c average chip signal of sin <dig> 220ha over the genes as identified in . d qrt-pcr verification of genes identified by rna-seq to change in expression upon sin3a knockdown versus gfp rnai. p-value ** < <dig> , *** < <dig> . e gene-ontology analysis of the genes identified in  are represented as bar plots. the y-axis lists the broad go categories. red: categories of genes that are directly repressed. blue: categories of genes directly activated. p-value  < <dig> 



to identify the genes regulated directly by sin <dig>  <dig>  we integrated the sin <dig>  <dig> chip-seq and the sin3a knockdown rna-seq data. we retained only those genes that responded to reduced sin <dig> expression and were bound by sin <dig>  <dig>  approximately 92 %  and 46 %  of the genes repressed and activated by sin <dig>  <dig>  respectively, are direct targets . this finding is particularly interesting because the data suggest that genes repressed by sin <dig>  <dig> are more likely to be direct targets in comparison to the genes activated by sin <dig>  <dig>  we next performed metagene analysis on genes directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> to study the distribution across gene features. a large majority of sin <dig>  <dig> peaks were found at the transcription start sites of the repressed and activated genes . we also observed some enrichment around the transcription end site, exclusively at genes activated by sin <dig>  <dig>  we note that the majority of the genes directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> are also bound by sin <dig>  <dig>  as indicated by the sin <dig>  <dig> chip-seq data . regulation of these genes by sin <dig>  <dig> is explained in more detail below.

the genomic experiments identified several genes directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  to verify the rna-seq data, we selected genes that showed a change in expression upon sin3a knockdown and were bound by sin <dig>  <dig> as determined by the chip-seq analysis. we utilized reverse transcription followed by quantitative pcr  to verify gene expression changes resulting from sin3a knockdown. we selected s-adenosyl methionine synthetase  and tumbleweed , which were found to be altered upon sin3a knockdown, and bound by sin <dig>  <dig> as well . consistent with the rna-seq data, we found that sam-s was upregulated upon sin3a knockdown, while expression of tum was reduced . these data indicate that in s <dig> cells, sin <dig>  <dig> acts as a co-repressor for sam-s and co-activator for tum.

next, we sought to investigate the biological processes that are regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  we performed gene ontology  analysis on the genes that were directly repressed and activated by sin <dig>  <dig> using the david gene annotation module . 52 %  of the repressed genes and 57 %  of the activated genes were enriched for go terms. metabolic pathways associated with perturbed levels of sin <dig> have been characterized in s <dig> and kc cell lines  <cit> . consistent with the published data, the category of metabolism was overrepresented in the genes repressed by sin <dig>  <dig>  in addition to the metabolic and biosynthetic processes, sin <dig>  <dig> repressed genes are linked to intracellular transport and junction assembly processes . additionally, go analysis revealed several well studied and novel biological processes overrepresented by genes activated by sin <dig>  <dig> . sin <dig>  <dig> was found to be important for activation of several genes involved in cell cycle. this is particularly interesting because sin <dig> was previously implicated in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . data from this current study indicate that the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform directly modulated expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. the go analysis indicated that sin <dig>  <dig> activated genes include those that regulate stress response and aging, which is in accord with our previous findings  <cit> . furthermore, these data demonstrate that sin <dig>  <dig> regulates genes involved in novel pathways such as cell morphogenesis, cell fate determination and cell growth. taken together, our findings in s <dig> cells demonstrate that sin <dig>  <dig> plays a critical role in mediating expression of genes encoding proteins involved in a wide array of biological processes. consistent with the widespread role of histone modifications in modulating gene expression, the gene regulatory transcriptional network controlled by sin <dig>  <dig> is quite diverse.

sin <dig>  <dig> regulates many similar genes as those regulated by sin <dig> 220
our findings demonstrate that the ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig> in s <dig> cells led to a reduction in the level of sin <dig>  <dig> . in addition, we found that sin <dig>  <dig> was replaced by sin <dig>  <dig> at genomic targets . during early drosophila embryogenesis, the levels of sin <dig> isoforms are comparable  <cit> . during the final stage, however, the relative level of the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform is reduced with an increase in expression of sin <dig>  <dig>  <cit> . based on these data, we hypothesized that sin <dig>  <dig> likely regulates a different set of genes from those of sin <dig>  <dig>  to test our hypothesis, we utilized rna-seq to perform differential gene expression analysis comparing the expression of genes in cells that express sin <dig> 187ha to the gene expression of non-transfected s <dig> cells . overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig> leads to the loss of sin <dig>  <dig> isoform in s <dig> cells, thus making this system ideal to investigate the regulatory roles of sin <dig>  <dig>  since sin <dig> 187ha was overexpressed in s <dig> cells, we used a stringent threshold of ≥ <dig> fold gene expression  alteration between the wild type s <dig> cells and cells that express sin <dig> 187ha. using this criterion, we identified  <dig> genes to be differentially regulated due ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig>  the number of genes repressed and activated by sin <dig>  <dig> is  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . to identify the genes directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  we combined the binding profile of sin <dig>  <dig> with the gene expression changes due to sin <dig>  <dig> overexpression. by combining the recruitment data and gene expression changes, we found sin <dig>  <dig> bound approximately 42 %  of repressed genes and 56 %  of activated genes , indicating direct regulation of these genes by sin <dig>  <dig> fig.  <dig> sin <dig>  <dig> regulates distinct as well as common genes as that of sin <dig>  <dig>  a scatter plots showing the correlation between genes bound and that change in expression upon overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig>  green dots denote genes regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> but not bound. red dots indicate genes that are regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> and are bound by both sin <dig> isoforms. black dots refer to genes uniquely bound and regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  b venn diagrams showing the comparison of genes directly regulated by sin <dig> isoforms. different classes of genes are labelled as a, b, c and d. r, repression. a, activation. c schematic showing the regulation of class a, b and c genes by the sin <dig> isoforms. the middle column shows the genes bound by sin <dig>  <dig> in wild type cells. gene expression upon sin3a  knockdown is depicted in the left column and gene expression upon ectopic expression of sin <dig> 187ha is represented in the right column



so far in our analysis, we have identified direct targets of sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> in s <dig> cells. we next made four comparisons :  <dig>  genes directly repressed by sin <dig>  <dig> to those directly repressed by sin <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  genes directly activated by sin <dig>  <dig> to those directly activated by sin <dig>  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  genes directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> in opposing directions. little overlap between gene sets was observed. these data imply that the isoforms are regulating very different sets of genes. careful consideration of the model system, however, suggests in fact, that this is not the case. these comparisons yielded four classes of genes: a. genes directly repressed  or activated  by sin <dig>  <dig>  b. genes directly repressed  or activated  by sin <dig>  <dig> as well as sin <dig>  <dig>  c. genes directly repressed  or activated  by sin <dig>  <dig> alone and d. genes that are directly regulated in opposing directions by sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> . for class a genes, we did not observe gene expression changes between wild type s <dig> cells and cells that overexpress sin <dig>  <dig>  this, however, does not exclude a role for sin <dig>  <dig> at class a genes. ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig> replaces sin <dig>  <dig> and thus may perform the same role as sin <dig>  <dig> without additional expression changes at gene targets compared to wild type cells. 95 %  and 62 %  of the directly repressed and directly activated class a genes, respectively, are bound by sin <dig>  <dig>  suggesting that majority of these genes are likely regulated by both sin <dig> isoforms . class a genes bound only by sin <dig>  <dig> are likely to be unique targets of sin <dig>  <dig> . surprisingly, the majority of the genes specifically bound by sin <dig>  <dig> were activated. of note, we cannot rule out the possibility that sin <dig>  <dig> might also be recruited to these potential sin <dig>  <dig> unique genes, as sin <dig>  <dig> peaks might not have been identified in the chip-seq assay due to statistical thresholds. a small number of genes were either repressed or activated by both sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> . all class b genes are directly regulated by both sin <dig> isoforms, suggesting that sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> regulate class b genes in a similar way. sin <dig>  <dig>  however, led to increased changes in expression of these genes relative to the wild type cells, implying that sin <dig>  <dig> has a stronger effect in regulating these genes compared to sin <dig>  <dig> . of high interest are the class c genes, which are genes uniquely regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  class c genes will be discussed in detail below. another set of genes falls into class d, which includes genes that are regulated in opposing directions by sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> . using rt-qpcr, we validated the differential effects of the isoforms on two representative genes of this class . this class also includes genes that are potentially regulated only by sin <dig>  <dig>  this gene set may show a change in expression upon overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig> due to the loss of sin <dig>  <dig> rather than enrichment of sin <dig>  <dig>  taken together, we conclude that majority of the genes that are directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> are also regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> in a similar fashion. in addition, we identified several genes to be distinctly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> 

sin <dig>  <dig> plays distinct roles to that of sin <dig>  <dig> in regulating gene expression
we performed metagene analysis on genes directly repressed and activated by sin <dig>  <dig>  this analysis revealed that the preferential binding sites of sin <dig>  <dig> are the transcriptional start sites of genes . similar to the observation for sin <dig>  <dig> binding, we found substantial enrichment of sin <dig>  <dig> around the transcriptional end sites of genes that are activated upon sin <dig> 187ha overexpression compared to those that are repressed . interestingly, 95 % of the genes directly repressed and 90 % of the genes directly activated by sin <dig>  <dig> were genes also bound by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform in the sin <dig> 220ha cell line . these findings indicate that upon expression of sin <dig> 187ha, the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform occupied the same sites previously bound by sin <dig>  <dig>  interestingly, a number of these commonly bound genes demonstrated a change in expression upon ectopic sin <dig>  <dig> expression, but not upon sin3a, essentially sin <dig>  <dig>  knockdown. thus, sin <dig>  <dig> specifically modulates expression of this set of genes . we identified  <dig> genes repressed and  <dig> activated uniquely by sin <dig>  <dig>  next, we selected two genes to verify the gene regulatory functions of sin <dig>  <dig>  based on the rna-seq data, we chose signal-transducer and activator of transcription protein at 92e  and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit , which are shown to be repressed and activated specifically by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform, respectively. in addition, these genes are bound by sin <dig>  <dig> at the promoter region as determined by the chip-seq data . using rt-qpcr, we demonstrate that overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig> led to repression of stat92e and activation of gclm, thus validating the rna-seq experiment . furthermore, we analyzed the expression of these genes upon knockdown of sin3a . our results demonstrate that reduction of sin3a  did not impact the expression of these genes , although sin <dig>  <dig> was bound to those genes in wild type cells . these results indicate that stat92e and gclm genes are specific targets of sin <dig>  <dig> activity.fig.  <dig> sin <dig>  <dig> distinctly regulates differentiation related genes. a average chip signal of sin <dig> 187ha over the genes directly regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  b qrt-pcr verification of genes identified by rna-seq to change in expression after overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig> versus control  but not affected upon sin3a knockdown versus gfp rnai . p-value * < <dig> , *** < <dig> . c gene ontology analysis of the class c genes identified in fig.  <dig> are represented as bar plots. the y-axis lists the broad go categories. red: categories of genes that are directly repressed. blue: categories of genes that are directly activated. p-value  < <dig> . biological processes labelled in bold indicate the unique processes that are overrepresented for genes distinctly regulated by sin <dig> 187



our previous research demonstrated that during the late stages of drosophila embryogenesis, expression of sin <dig>  <dig> increases and the relative level of the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform is reduced  <cit> . these results led to the hypothesis that sin <dig>  <dig> might play a specific role during the latter stages of embryo development. in the current study, we identified the genes specifically regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> and bound by sin <dig>  <dig> in cultured cells . next, we sought to examine the biological processes that are represented by these genes. we performed go analysis on the unique direct sin <dig>  <dig> targets . approximately, 63 %  of the genes repressed and 56 %  of the genes activated by sin <dig>  <dig> were enriched for go terms . strikingly, the go analysis demonstrates that sin <dig>  <dig> regulated genes are involved in post-embryonic development, metamorphosis and apoptosis. interestingly, these categories of biological processes are largely specific to sin <dig>  <dig> regulated genes when compared to the genes regulated upon sin3a  knockdown . additionally, we found that genes involved in phosphate metabolism, phosphorylation, endocytosis, embryonic morphogenesis and development of respiratory system were regulated specifically by the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform. further, we identified a few biological processes regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> that were also impacted upon sin3a  knockdown. for example, biological processes such as neuron development, cell morphogenesis and aging are overrepresented by both sin <dig>  <dig> regulated genes and genes that show a change in expression due to reduction of sin3a . collectively, these data indicate that sin <dig>  <dig> specifically modulates biological processes involved in differentiation and development, in addition to regulating processes in common with the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform.

discussion
in this research, we have described the differential role of the sin <dig> isoforms in regulating gene activity, summarized in fig.  <dig>  we have shown that the level of the largest isoform, sin <dig>  <dig>  is regulated by ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig>  in addition, upon overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig>  sin <dig>  <dig> replaces sin <dig>  <dig> at genomic targets. based on the chip-seq data, we determined that sin <dig> isoforms localize to overlapping genomic regions, the large majority of which occupy the promoter region of genes. additionally, global transcriptome analysis revealed that sin <dig> isoforms play overlapping roles in regulating processes involved in metabolism, cell cycle and aging. interestingly, we identified unique genes modulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  these genes are overrepresented for biological processes that link the activity of sin <dig>  <dig> to the control of genes encoding proteins that function in post-embryonic development, endocytosis, phosphate metabolism and embryonic morphogenesis. together, the current study demonstrates functional overlap as well as non-redundancy of sin <dig> isoforms.fig.  <dig> a model depicting the role of sin <dig> isoforms in the regulation of gene expression



in cultured drosophila cells, ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig> led to a reduced level of sin <dig>  <dig> . this switch in expression mimics the expression pattern of sin <dig> isoforms observed during drosophila embryonic development  <cit> . together, the fly and s <dig> cell culture data suggest that sin <dig>  <dig> regulates the expression and/or stability of the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform. the mechanism through which ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig> may affect the amount of sin <dig>  <dig>  however, remains unknown. preliminary studies from our laboratory suggest that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is occurring in the cells . the chip data indicate that ectopically expressed sin <dig>  <dig> replaces sin <dig>  <dig> at genomic targets. we also determined that the enrichment of sin <dig>  <dig> at genomic loci was dependent on the level of sin <dig>  <dig> present . therefore, it is plausible that a critical ratio of sin <dig>  <dig> to sin <dig>  <dig> is essential to determine which of the two isoforms will occupy a gene target, thereby modulating the transcriptional outcome. additionally, the stage specific expression of sin <dig> isoforms during the life cycle of drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  favors the idea that maintenance of a critical ratio of sin <dig> isoforms is important.

the gene expression analysis demonstrates that sin <dig>  <dig> might play similar roles as that of sin <dig>  <dig> as well as carry out unique functions. it is therefore curious that, unlike sin <dig>  <dig>  expression of sin <dig>  <dig> alone does not rescue fly lethality caused by a null mutation in the sin3a gene  <cit> . one possibility is that sin <dig>  <dig> plays a critical gene regulatory role only in the presence of sin <dig>  <dig>  this scenario is supported by the finding that expression of both sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> in a sin3a null background led to a greater percentage of surviving flies compared to expression of sin <dig>  <dig> alone  <cit> . additionally, we determined that sin <dig>  <dig> is recruited to similar gene targets as that of sin <dig>  <dig>  we speculate that localization of sin <dig>  <dig> to chromatin is dependent or partially dependent on sin <dig>  <dig>  the preferential interaction of sin <dig>  <dig> with p <dig>  lid and emsy  <cit>  suggests a differential genomic binding capacity of the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform that might facilitate the subsequent recruitment of sin <dig>  <dig>  p <dig>  a wd- <dig> repeat containing protein, has been demonstrated to provide an interaction framework for histones and other proteins to form multimeric complexes . therefore, it is likely that p <dig> plays an important role in the chromatin recruitment of sin <dig>  <dig>  lid facilitates the removal of the histone h3k <dig> trimethyl mark . a recent study using a mouse cell line revealed that the level of histone h3k4me <dig> influences the recruitment of msin3a to target sites  <cit> . therefore, the lid-containing sin <dig>  <dig> complex might alter the chromatin composition in a way that enables subsequent recruitment of sin <dig>  <dig> 

one of the most surprising findings from our study is that despite the extensive amount of overlapping localization of sin <dig> isoforms, the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform regulates the level of expression of a distinct set of genes . one possibility for this result is that binding of sin <dig>  <dig> leads to differential chromatin modification. we have previously shown that ectopic expression of sin <dig>  <dig> significantly affects both global histone h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation  <cit> . on the other hand, global changes of only histone h3k <dig> acetylation were observed upon overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the sin <dig>  <dig> isoform specific complex might recruit other trans-factors to chromatin, thereby altering transcription in distinct ways. to identify the mechanisms by which sin <dig> isoforms regulate gene expression, more extensive evaluation of the interplay of cis-elements and trans-factors in relation to the sin <dig> complexes is required.

although we mapped the occupancy of sin <dig> isoforms to approximately  <dig> genes, the transcriptome analysis in s <dig> cells showed that expression of approximately  <dig> genes is affected due to alteration in the level of sin <dig> isoforms. we question why many binding events of the sin <dig> isoforms do not affect gene expression . one explanation is that s <dig> cells do not represent the complexity of gene regulation in the whole organism. sin <dig> isoforms might contribute to gene expression changes depending on their interaction with stage specific transcription factors during the developmental stages of the whole organism. in addition, we do not rule out the possibility that some fortuitous associations of sin <dig> isoforms occur, which do not contribute to gene expression alterations, a possibility that has been previously suggested  <cit> . a recent publication reported a list of putative false positive binding peaks referred to as phantom peaks  <cit> . the authors suggested that these regions are occupied by any transcription factor irrespective of their biological relevance. approximately 40 % of peaks identified for sin <dig> isoforms by our chip-seq assay overlapped with the phantom peaks . approximately 10 % of these peaks, however, can be assigned to genes that demonstrated expression changes due to alterations in the level of sin <dig> isoforms, indicating that enrichment of sin <dig> isoforms at these loci have functional outcomes.

the large majority of peaks identified for the sin <dig> isoforms, mapping around the 5’ end of genes , is consistent with observations in other model systems. interestingly, we observed a substantial level of enrichment of the sin <dig> isoforms around the transcription end sites of the genes activated by sin <dig> isoforms . alteration of gene expression due to changes in higher order chromatin structure has been reported and reviewed  <cit> . therefore, we wonder if there is any possibility that gene looping influences the function of sin <dig> isoforms as co-activators of genes. more extensive studies, however, are required to understand the possibility of gene looping and its role in gene regulation by sin <dig> isoforms.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results indicate complex mechanisms through which genes are regulated by the sin <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> isoforms. this result suggests that the highly similar sin <dig> isoforms likely work in concert with other factors that differentially affect transcript levels. these data suggest a novel mechanism of gene regulation by sin <dig> isoforms, by which the sin <dig> isoforms localize to overlapping genomic sites and modulate some similar and many distinct biological processes. collectively, these findings set a solid framework for further understanding of the network of biological processes regulated by sin <dig> histone modifying complexes.
