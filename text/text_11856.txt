BACKGROUND
the homeobox gene superclass is large, with recent annotations indicating over  <dig> functional homeobox genes in human and over  <dig> in mice . the large number of genes is mirrored by a vast range of reported expression sites and biological roles, such that few general statements can be made about homeobox gene function. although the great majority of homeobox genes encode transcription factors, even this general statement might not be true for every gene since some homeodomains have reported roles in rna-binding roles  <cit>  or in modification of higher order chromatin structure  <cit> ; a few vertebrate homeobox genes  even encode probable transmembrane proteins  <cit> . in biology, order can often be brought out of chaos if evolutionary history is considered. in recent years, we and others have attempted to build evolutionarily-based classifications of homeobox genes that should facilitate this  <cit> . the classification of holland et al.  <cit>  divides the homeobox genes into  <dig> classes , subdivided into over  <dig> gene classes; the largest class can be divided into two subclasses , although some genes are difficult to place, such as en and dlx. the scheme of bürglin and affolter  <cit>  is broadly similar but erects  <dig> classes, dividing prd and tale into two and five classes respectively.

the best known homeobox genes, such as hox genes and some other antp class genes, have well-characterised spatial patterning roles in embryonic development, but there are also many reports of expression and function of hox genes in adult tissues . other non-hox homeobox genes, including many in the lim class, can be considered to have more cell type-specific roles, rather than region-specific roles, in development and in adult tissues  <cit> . in contrast to region-specific or cell type-specific genes, more widespread expression might be expected for some homeobox genes, such as some in the tale class, encoding co-factors of a range of homeodomain proteins  <cit> . at the extreme, the pou2f <dig> gene has been reported as having ubiquitous expression  <cit> . although an earlier study compared expression of all transcription factors  <cit> , analysis at the level of homeobox gene family and class has not been undertaken; furthermore, much additional high-throughput expression data are now available. hence, relationships between homeobox diversity and expression have not been tested.

we wished to investigate whether homeobox genes from certain evolutionary classes are expressed more broadly in adult tissues and organs than are genes from other homeobox classes. for example, we predict that antp and prd genes are more restricted in expression than tale and class genes, but is this prediction supported by data? here we undertake this test, made possible due to the availability of a broad range of transcriptome sequencing  datasets, particularly from adult human organs. we also ask whether it is possible to establish sets of homeobox genes that are enriched in expression in particular datasets, providing ‘homeobox codes’ for adult tissues and organs.

although human data are ideal for examining homeobox expression in adult organs because of the range of rnaseq datasets available, the same is not true for embryonic development. several transcriptome datasets have been released for preimplantation human development , and we ask if there are sets of homeobox genes enriched at such early embryonic stages. to examine patterns after embryo implantation, mouse is a more amenable system and we test whether there are global changes to homeobox gene expression diversity during mouse development.

methods
to enable gene expression to be compared between tissues, organs and developmental stages, it is important to calculate expression levels using identical methods for each rnaseq dataset. to enable this, we did not use published fpkm data  or rpkm data , but took publicly-available rnaseq data files for each human tissue, organ sample or developmental stage, and remapped the raw sequence reads to human genome assembly ncbi grch <dig> p <dig>  for most tissues, organs and developmental stages, replicate rnaseq datasets were merged . we used the star rna-seq aligner  <cit>  using the default settings with the addition of --outsamstrandfield intronmotif and --outfiltermultimapnmax  <dig> for mouse and  <dig> for human to increase the limit for multimapping reads before they would be discarded; this improves accuracy of expression analysis from repeated loci.

for human data, we used a collection of  <dig> sra datasets analysed previously  <cit> . these comprise  <dig> million paired end sequence reads and  <dig> million single end sequence reads representing  <dig> developmental stages or tissue types. read mapping to most homeobox genes was performed in  <cit> ; to this analysis we added nanognb, cphx <dig> and cphx <dig> . this analysis gave fpkm  data for  <dig> human homeobox genes comprising all human loci listed by zhong and holland  <cit>  after excluding  <dig> pseudogenes and several closely similar duplicated dux loci. loc <dig> has been named anhx  gene by pwhh, elspeth bruford and ying-fu zhong . to avoid spurious or background read counts conflating analysis, we considered any fpkm value < <dig> as equal to zero. classification of human homeobox genes followed zhong and holland  <cit> , based on holland et al.  <cit> , except that cphx <dig> and cphx <dig> are here placed in the prd class following töhönen et al.  <cit> . nanognb is here provisionally considered in the antp class on the basis of chromosomal location, tprx <dig> is considered a functional gene rather than a pseudogene  <cit> , and dux loci are restricted to duxa, duxb and dux <dig> 


identical methods were used for mouse homeobox genes and rnaseq data sets, using genome assembly grcm <dig> . in total,  <dig>  million single end sequence reads and  <dig>  million paired end reads from  <dig> sra datasets representing  <dig> developmental stages were mapped . data are reported as derived from whole embryos. the mouse homeobox gene set comprised  <dig> genes and followed zhong and holland  <cit> , with the exception of some minor annotation differences within the complex obox, crxos and rhox <dig> gene families. classification of mouse homeobox genes followed zhong and holland  <cit> , except that cphx, gm <dig> and gm <dig>  were placed in the prd class, along with crxos <dig> 

RESULTS
diversity of homeobox gene expression in human tissues and organs
to assess which tissues and organs express each homeobox gene, we mapped publicly available rnaseq data to the human genome and calculated fpkm values for every homeobox gene . figure  <dig> shows relative gene expression levels , clustered according to expression profile . from this analysis, we compiled lists of homeobox genes with similar expression profiles across adult human tissues or preimplantation stages .fig.  <dig> heatmap showing human homeobox gene expression. expression data for  <dig> homeobox loci across  <dig> human cell types and tissues clustered according to expression level after normalising individually to the maximal expression of each gene. red high expression; blue low or zero expression. the horizontal coloured bars indicate the homeobox class for each gene. the same figure, showing gene names, is given in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  the colour coding of each larger grouping corresponds to additional file 5: tables s <dig> to s <dig> where genes in each group are listed




a clear pattern is that most homeobox genes have moderately specific expression patterns; by this we mean that most genes have one site of maximal expression , and few other tissues with high or moderate expression, with most tissues being negative or substantially lower. there are important exceptions, however, and we identify  <dig> homeobox genes with very widespread expression profiles across a large number of tissues . these widely-expressed genes include six tale class genes, including several genes  whose protein products are known to form co-factor complexes with a range of partner transcription factors  <cit> . this role as common co-factors may explain the widespread expression we detect. also included in the list of widely expressed homeobox genes are prrx , six <dig> , cux <dig> , three members of the cers class encoding transmembrane proteins, and eight members of the zf class. we propose that these genes have general roles in cellular functioning. it is perhaps surprising that pou2f <dig> is not among the list, since this gene has formerly been described as ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . the reason is that elevated expression in preimplantation stages causes this gene to cluster with preimplantation-specific homeobox genes. it is striking that there are no antp class genes in the ‘widespread expression’ category, despite these comprising the largest homeobox class in humans . this finding further supports the contention that antp class genes are primarily involved in spatial patterning during embryonic development.

additional file 5: tables s <dig> to s <dig> list sets of homeobox genes that show degrees of tissue specificity; these groupings are generated by expression clustering analysis. biologically similar tissues, such as ‘neural tissues’ or ‘immune-related tissues’, form distinct groups in the analysis. additional file 5: table s <dig>  comprises genes expressed predominantly in brain and neural tissues, including cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, parietal lobe, amygdala, substantia nigra, foetal brain and tissues of the eye. different homeobox genes are expressed in distinct subsets of these tissues, as shown in additional file 5: table s <dig>  there are no hox genes in this set, despite the fact that numerous studies have examined the role of hox genes in neural patterning. however, we note that the neural rnaseq data analysed are derived predominantly from anterior brain regions whereas most studies of vertebrate hox gene expression reveal spatial expression only in body regions posterior to the middle of the hindbrain  <cit> . adult forebrain expression of hox genes has been reported  <cit>  but is relatively low level, explaining why this does not show as a major hox gene expression site in our analysis. even though hox genes do not feature in the ‘neural-enriched’ set, it does include several other antp class genes including several implicated in specification and patterning of anterior brain regions in other vertebrates: barhl <dig>  barhl <dig>  en <dig>  en <dig>  tlx <dig>  nkx6- <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  dlx <dig>  dlx <dig>  hmx <dig>  vax <dig>  gsx <dig>  amongst the prd class, homeobox genes in this dataset include the retinal gene crx, the pax <dig> gene which is mutated in aniridia, two human rax genes and the two human vsx genes.

additional file 5: table s <dig>  includes homeobox genes predominantly expressed in immune tissues such as b-cells, t-cells, monocytes, neutrophils and bone marrow. these include several homeobox genes known to be associated with immune function notably: pax <dig>  somatic and germline mutations in which are associated with b-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit> ; hlx which modulates interferon expression in t-cells  <cit> ; satb <dig>  encoding a chromatin loop-associated homeodomain protein implicated in t-cell development  <cit> ; pou2f <dig> required for b-cell maturation and survival  <cit> ; ventx involved in macrophage differentiation  <cit> . the inclusion of pbx <dig> and pbx <dig> in this set is more surprising and suggests further investigation. we caution, however, that the precise delineation of the ‘immune-enriched’ dataset  is sensitive to changing the fpkm cut-off used for defining expression versus background .

additional file 5: table s <dig>  comprises homeobox genes expressed predominantly in reproductive tissues and early development, specifically testis, placenta, oocyte and preimplantation embryos . several homeobox genes have already been described as characteristic of one or more of these tissues or developmental stages, and these are found in our list. examples include nanog and pou5f <dig> which are well-characterised markers of pluripotent cells and several totipotent-cell expressed prd class genes that have been the focus of recent functional studies   <cit> . interestingly, many other homeobox genes also cluster in this set on the basis of their expression, including two hox genes  indicating they are worthy of further study in this regard . hoxd <dig> expression has been previously reported in preimplantation mouse and cow embryos  but not to our knowledge hoxc13; however, one of the two hoxc <dig> duplicates in zebrafish is expressed in early cleavage stages  <cit> .

we refined the analysis to identify homeobox genes that are expressed only in these reproductive tissues and developmental stages ; we also added ovary to this set, as this was not grouped with them by expression clustering methodology. we identify  <dig> human homeobox genes that are expressed exclusively in reproductive or very early developmental tissues in this analysis . over half  have a clearly defined maximum expression level confined to a small developmental window from 8-cell to the morula stage of embryo development. not only is the expression of these genes tightly regulated, but we note  <dig> of them  are phylogenetically restricted to within eutherian mammals . the correlation between tight expression specificity and similar phylogenetic distribution suggests there may have been selective pressures to co-opt novel homeobox genes to new developmental roles during the evolution of eutherian mammals. the peak of 8-cell to morula suggests these genes may combine to prepare the totipotent stages of embryonic development for subsequent cell fate specialisation. indeed, two recent studies have postulated regulatory roles for several of these genes during early human embryo development  <cit> .fig.  <dig> heatmap showing gene expression for human homeobox genes expressed specifically in reproductive tissues, development stages and embryonic stem cells. a gene was determined to be ‘embryo or reproductive tissue-specific’ if the fpkm expression level was greater than  <dig> in one or more stages and below  <dig> in all examined adult tissues




additional file 5: table s <dig>  lists an assemblage of homeobox genes with predominant expression in particular organs system; these organs do not necessarily group together in expression clustering. for example, two genes have highest expression in gall bladder , several posterior hox genes plus evx <dig> and nkx3- <dig> associate with colon and prostate, and pdx <dig> is in duodenum. other examples are given in additional file 5: table s <dig> 

additional file 5: table s <dig>  groups homeobox genes that do not have clear expression in the rnaseq datasets under study. many of these are genes with well characterised roles in mid to late embryonic development in other vertebrates ; it is likely that their assignment to this category reflects the fact that in this analysis we used adult human tissues and preimplantation stages since there are few rnaseq datasets from postimplantation human development; model species such as mouse are more amenable for studying such developmental stages.

homeobox genes expressed in mouse development
to examine temporal patterns of homeobox gene expression through postimplantation mammalian embryonic development, mouse is a tractable system. we mapped publicly available rnaseq data to the mouse genome and calculated fpkm values for every homeobox gene . the datasets analysed ranged from oocyte to  <dig>  days’ post coitum ; we excluded developmental stages later than e <dig>  as most major organs systems are forming by e <dig> , meaning that total embryo datasets become complex amalgamations of parts. there is also a temporal gap between blastocyst  and e <dig> , which reflects the practical difficulties of identifying and dissecting embryos at the earliest post-implantation stages. figure  <dig> shows relative expression levels , clustered according to expression profile.fig.  <dig> heatmap showing mouse homeobox gene expression in development. expression data for  <dig> mouse homeobox loci across  <dig> embryonic stages clustered according to expression level after normalising individually to the maximal expression of each gene. the horizontal coloured bars indicate the homeobox class for each gene. the same figure, showing gene names, is given in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  genes in each temporal group are also listed in additional file 7: table s9




the most striking features of this analysis are several clear temporal shifts in the clustered patterns of gene activity, which could be described as four ‘phases’ of gene expression separated by ‘gear changes’ . gene names are given in additional file 6: figure s <dig> and additional file 7: table s <dig>  first, from oocyte to zygote, a set of maternal transcripts predominate, with these genes showing little expression later than this stage. these transcripts derive predominantly from homeobox genes in the prd class. second, at the 2-cell stage, corresponding to the first stage of embryonic genome activation , a clear and distinct set of prd class genes is activated; few of these persist to the 4-cell stage. these genes include homologues of the human prd genes, noted above, that are expressed in human from 4-cell or 8-cell to morula . one group of homeobox genes, from multiple classes, spans phases  <dig> and  <dig> in their profile of expression. third, at the 4-cell to 8-cell stage another distinct set of homeobox genes is activated, with many of these genes persisting in expression until blastocyst. fourth, the expression profile from e <dig>  onwards is strikingly different, although we are missing the fine temporal detail of the transitions between blastocyst and e <dig> . thus, there is a very clear distinction between the homeobox genes expressed in preimplantation stages, and the homeobox genes expressed in post-implantation stages . within the latter group there is considerable variation, with some genes initiating strong expression at e <dig>  and others as late as e <dig> . the group of genes that initiate as late as e <dig>  is dominated by members of the hoxl subclass of the antp class, including many canonical hox genes. we suggest this increased deployment of the antp class marks the principal phase of spatial patterning, as positional identities are conferred to regions along the anteroposterior body axis within each germ layer and incipient organs are specified.

do classes of homeobox gene differ in tissue specificity?
the same gene expression data were used to examine whether different classes of human homeobox genes have more or less tissue specificity. we find considerable spread of expression specificity within each of the  <dig> homeobox gene classes . four classes show high tissue specificity : antp, prd, lim and pou. the high specificity is particularly striking for antp and prd classes, as these contain large numbers of genes . this high specificity is consistent with roles in cell-type and tissue-type specification, and also for regional patterning if subsequent roles are predominantly located within organs developing within restricted spatial domains. it is notable that antp, prd, lim and pou classes  have been considered metazoan-specific  <cit> , consistent with a model in which homeobox genes were recruited for spatial patterning specifically in metazoan evolution. in contrast, the hnf, tale, zf and cers homeobox gene classes show less tissue specificity, although individual genes reveal exceptions to the pattern and ranges overlap. this finding supports our prediction that the tale class would show less specificity than the antp and prd classes; the findings for zf and cers are revealing and suggest widespread roles for most homeobox genes within these classes. one possible source of artefact for this analysis would be if different tissues themselves expressed radically different numbers of homeobox genes; if this were the case they could not be treated as equivalent datasets. however, although there is variation between tissues this is not extreme, with most human tissues in the dataset expressing between  <dig> and  <dig> homeobox genes .fig.  <dig> the number of human cell types and tissues in which individual human homeobox loci are expressed. each coloured dot indicates an individual homeobox locus. boxplots were generated using boxplot function in r; the box defines the 25th to 75th quartiles with the 50th identified by the horizontal line, whiskers define limits outside which samples are classed as outliers




CONCLUSIONS
we have examined the tissue specificity of gene expression across the homeobox gene superclass of humans, and the temporal profiles of expression for homeobox genes of human and mouse. several key findings emerge from these analyses.

first, we identify a set of  <dig> human genes with very widespread expression, including multiple members of the tale, cers and zf classes, and single members of the prd, sine and cut classes. we suggest these genes have general roles in cellular functioning.

second, most homeobox genes have relatively distinct tissue specific expression, and we compile and present distinct lists of human homeobox genes with enriched expression in neural tissues, in immune tissues, in reproductive and developmental samples, and in numerous organ systems.

third, we have identified  <dig> eutherian-specific homeobox genes with strikingly specific expression patterns during the 8-cell and morula stages of human embryo development. the expression of these genes is not detectable outside of reproductive tissues or the embryo.

fourth, we identify four distinct phases of homeobox gene expression in mouse development, specifically: oocyte to zygote; 2-cell; 4-cell to blastocyst; early to mid post-implantation. the most dramatic shifts in homeobox gene expression are between 2-cell and 4-cell, and between blastocyst and post-implantation. within this group there is a gradual shift in expression between e <dig>  and e <dig>  dominated by new expression of hoxl antp class genes.

fifth, we find that distinct classes of homeobox gene differ greatly in specificity of expression: antp, prd, lim and pou have highest tissue specificity; hnf, tale, zf and cers are the most widely expressed.
