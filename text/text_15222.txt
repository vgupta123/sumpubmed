BACKGROUND
poor microbiological quality of water results from contamination by microorganisms of human or animal origin and leads to the risk of gastro-enteritis in humans  <cit> . the assurance of the microbiological quality of environmental water used as a source for recreational water is a global issue  <cit> . total coliforms, faecal coliforms, escherichia coli and enterococci are commonly used microbial indicators of water quality  <cit> . however, several studies of both recreational and drinking water samples suggested that enterococci are more relevant indicators of faecal contamination than faecal coliforms and e. coli  <cit> . previous epidemiological studies demonstrated a correlation between the concentration of enterococci in surface waters and an increase in swimmer-associated gastroenteritis  <cit> . the united states environmental protection agency  advises various limits as guidelines for recreational water quality. for freshwater, the present single-sample advisory limit is  <dig> cfu/ <dig> ml for enterococci. the 5-day geometric mean should not exceed  <dig> cfu/ <dig> ml for enterococci  <cit> . according to the australian national health and medical research council  guidelines, there are four microbial assessment categories, a-d, based on enterococcal counts per ml  together with associated health risks  <cit> .

enterococci are members of the natural intestinal flora of animals and humans and are released into the environment directly or via sewage outlets  <cit> . certain members of the genus, particularly e. faecalis and e. faecium, are becoming increasingly important as opportunistic pathogens  <cit> . most important and a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of enterococci is their resistance to a wide range of antibiotics  <cit> . enterococci have been found to be increasingly resistant to multiple anti-microbial drugs in last few years  <cit> . enterococci show either intrinsic resistance where resistance genes are located on the chromosome, or they possess acquired resistance determinants which are located on plasmids or transposons  <cit> . examples of the intrinsic antibiotic resistance include resistance to beta-lactams, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and low levels of clindamycin and aminoglycosides  <cit> . resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, high levels of clindamycin and aminoglycosides, tetracycline, high levels of beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and glycopeptides such as vancomycin are examples of acquired resistance  <cit> .

the distribution of infectious enterococcal strains into the environment via water could increase the prevalence of these strains in the human population. environmental water quality studies may benefit from focusing on a subset of enterococcus spp. that are consistently associated with sources of faecal pollution such as domestic sewage, rather than testing for the entire genus. e. faecalis and e. faecium are potentially good focal species for such studies, as they have been consistently identified as the dominant enterococcus spp. in human faeces  <cit>  and sewage  <cit> . the characterisation of e. faecalis and e. faecium is important in studying their population structures, particularly in environmental samples. different methods have been developed for the characterisation of enterococci  <cit> . however, there is a need to develop and apply new robust, rapid and cost effective techniques which are likely to yield more definitive results for the routine monitoring of e. faecalis and e. faecium. this was addressed in our previous study where we developed a single-nucleotide polymorphisms  based genotyping method to study the population structure of e. faecalis and e. faecium  <cit> . a set of eight high-d snps was derived from the e. faecalis and e. faecium multilocus sequence typing  database, using the 'minimum snps' software program, which provided a high simpson's index of diversity , calculated with respect to the mlst database. an allele-specific real-time pcr  method was developed to interrogate these high-d snps  <cit> . snp interrogation is an efficient means of classifying e. faecalis and e. faecium into groups that are concordant with the population structure of these organisms  <cit> . in this study we have applied this rapid snp genotyping method to determine the diversity of enterococci in the coomera river, south east queensland, australia over a period of two years and also investigated the antibiotic resistance determinants associated with e. faecalis and e. faecium snp genotypes.

methods
study site
the pimpama-coomera watershed is located in south east queensland, australia and is used intensively for agriculture and recreational purposes and has a strong anthropogenic impact. the main water source is the coomera river, which flows for  <dig> km from its headwaters in the lamington national park. the upper reaches of the river passes through mainly rural areas comprising crops and cattle grazing. in the middle to lower reaches, land uses include farming and cropping. in the 1970s and 1980s the river was widened  <dig> km upstream from the mouth as a consequence of sand and gravel extraction operations. the lower reaches of the coomera river passes through highly developed areas including canal estates such as santa barbara, hope island, sanctuary cove and the coomera mooring marina. most of the sewage system collection is gravity fed and follows natural catchment drainage lines until the wastewater is treated at the central treatment plant. after treatment, the water is released into the gold coast seaway located south of the coomera river estuary. despite the existence of such an effective treatment system, high numbers of coliforms were observed over a long period of time in the estuary.

sampling
environmental water samples were collected during four seasonal trips at the same time each day from six designated sites of the coomera river, from may  <dig> to july  <dig>  hot-spots selected for sampling included: coomera marina , santa barbara , sanctuary cove , jabiru island , paradise point  and coombabah . these sites were suggested by the gold coast city council as being problematic sites with a history of high numbers of faecal coliforms. the positions of these sampling sites are shown in figure  <dig>  the exact location and characteristics of sampling sites are summarised in table  <dig> 

b global information system

water samples were collected in sterile bottles according to the sampling procedures described in the usepa microbiology methods manual  <cit> . the sampling depth for surface water samples were 6- <dig> inches below the water surface. samples were transported in a cooler on ice packs to the laboratory where they were prepared for analyses immediately upon arrival and were tested within  <dig> h of collection for the presence of enterococci.

isolation and identification of enterococci
the environmental water samples were mixed thoroughly, and undiluted samples or a 1: <dig> dilution of water samples were filtered through  <dig>  μm membrane filters , placed onto membrane-enterococcus indoxyl β-d-glucoside agar   according to the usepa specifications  <cit> . triplicate samples were collected from each site and each sample was treated separately. the addition of indoxyl-β-d-glucoside, nalidixic acid,  <dig>  n naoh, and triphenyltetrazolium chloride to mei agar  allowed for a single  <dig> h incubation period at 41°c  <cit> . e. faecium atcc  <dig>  e. faecalis atcc  <dig> and e. coli atcc  <dig> were used as positive and negative controls respectively to validate the mei agar. colonies producing a blue halo were typically observed for enterococci and counted, the result expressed as cfu/ml for each water sample.

statistical analysis
the mann-whitney u-test at 5% significance level was performed to determine whether there was a significant increase of total enterococcal counts  at each location after rainfall events.

identification of e. faecium and e. faecalis
typical colonies on the membranes were identified to the genus and species level by gram-stain, catalase test, the ability to tolerate  <dig> % nacl and biochemical tests  <cit> . the isolates identified as e. faecium and e. faecalis were used in this study and species identification was confirmed by performing real-time pcr to detect the ddle. faecalis and ddle. feacium genes. the primers used were: 5'caaactgttggcattccacaa3' and 5'tggatttcctttccagtcacttc3' ; and 5'gaagagctgctgcaaaatgctttagc3' and 5'gcgcgcttcaattccttgt3'   <cit> .

antibiotic susceptibility testing
antibiotic resistance phenotypes were determined by the disc diffusion method according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute  recommendations  <cit> . saline suspensions of isolated colonies selected from an 18- <dig> hour brain heart infusion agar  plates were prepared and suspension turbidity was adjusted to an equivalent of a  <dig>  mc farland standard and inoculated onto mueller hinton agar  using sterile cotton swabs. antibiotic discs for ampicillin , ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , tetracycline , and vancomycin , were placed onto the surface of each inoculated plate. the diameters of antibiotic inhibition zones were measured and recorded as susceptible , intermediate resistant  or resistant  according to clsi m02-a <dig>  e. faecalis atcc  <dig> and staphylococcus aureus atcc  <dig> were used for quality control.

dna extraction
enterococcal strains were sub-cultured into brain heart infusion broth  and incubated at 37°c overnight. a  <dig> μl aliquot of an overnight culture was used for dna extraction. the corbett x-tractor gene automated dna extraction system was used to extract dna from all cultured isolates  using the core protocol no. <dig> version  <dig>  the automated dna extraction system allows for the simultaneous extraction of dna from  <dig> isolates. the quality and quantity of the dna was high, yielding  <dig> ug/ml dna on average and with a mean 260: <dig> absorbance ratio of  <dig> .

snp profiling of e. faecium and e. faecalis by allele-specific real-time pcr
a method for a highly-discriminatory snp genotyping method for e. faecium and e. faecalis, has been developed by our group  <cit> . in total,  <dig> e. faecalis and  <dig> e. faecium isolates were genotyped by the snp method using allele-specific real-time pcr . each reaction contained  <dig> μl of dna which was added to  <dig> μl of reaction master mix containing  <dig> μl of  <dig> × sybrgreen® pcr mastermix  and  <dig>  μl of reverse and forward primers   <cit> . cycling conditions were as follows: 50°c for  <dig> min, 95°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> seconds, 60°c for  <dig> seconds, and a melting stage of 60°c-90°c. each isolate was tested in duplicate and no template controls  were used for each primer set as well. an isolate specific snp profile for all e. faecium and e. faecalis was generated consisting of the polymorphism present at each of the snps. a complete description of the relationship between the snp profiles of each isolate and mlst-defined population structure was determined for both e. faecalis and e. faecium, using the mlst database and the "working backwards" mode of the minimum snps program.

snp validation by sequencing of mlst housekeeping genes
e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates representing each possible snp were used to validate the polymorphism present at each position. sequencing was performed to confirm the snp profiles using mlst sequencing primers listed at http://efaecalis.mlst.net/misc/info.asp and http://efaecium.mlst.net/misc/info.asp. pcr products were prepared for sequencing using the high pure pcr product purification kit  according to manufacturer's instructions. between  <dig> - <dig> ng dna template was mixed with the relevant sequencing primer at a final concentration of  <dig>  pmol in a  <dig> μl reaction containing the big dye terminator mix . sequencing reactions were performed using a protocol of 96°c for  <dig> min, 96°c for  <dig> s, 50°c for  <dig> s and 60°c for  <dig> min on the ab3730xl platform. sequencing data were analyzed using chromas  and vector nti  software programs.

real-time pcr for the detection of antibiotic resistance
primer design
real-time pcr primers for genes encoding vancomycin , tetracycline , tet, tet), ciprofloxacin , ampicillin  and gentamicin -aph) resistance were designed using the primer express  <dig>  primer design software program  . primers were synthesised by sigma-aldrich, castle hill, new south wales, australia.

real-time pcr
each reaction contained  <dig> μl of dna which was added to  <dig> μl of reaction master mix containing  <dig> μl of  <dig> × sybrgreen® pcr mastermix  and  <dig>  μl of reverse and forward primers . cycling conditions were as follows: 50°c for  <dig> min, 95°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> seconds, 60°c for  <dig> seconds, and a melting stage of 60°c-90°c. each isolate was tested in duplicate. no template controls  and previously characterized positive controls were used for each primer set as well.

mutation detection in the gyra and pbp <dig> genes
all ciprofloxacin- and ampicillin-resistant and intermediate-resistant isolates were screened for gene mutations. the gyra and pbp <dig> genes were amplified and sequenced. primers used were: 5'cgggatgaacgaattgggtgtga3'and 5' aattttactcatacgtgcttcgg 3' ; and 5' cgggatctcacaagaagat 3'and 5' ttattgataattttggtt 3'   <cit> . sequencing reactions were prepared as for the snp validation step described above. sequence data was analysed using chromas  and vector nti  software programs.

RESULTS
the poor microbiological quality of recreational waters is a global issue  <cit> . there is a great need to rapidly and accurately determine human faecal contamination of recreational waters. we applied a snp genotyping method to water samples collected from the coomera river, south east queensland, australia, to determine the distribution and diversity of e. faecalis and e. faecium strains and establish the antibiotic profiles associated with different snp profiles.

total enterococccal counts in the coomera river, over a two year period
enumeration of enterococcal strains was performed at each of the six sampling sites along the coomera river, and these counts were compared to the single-sample advisory limit specified by the us environmental protection agency  and the australian nhmrc guidelines for water quality assessment. previous studies have found that the concentration of faecal indicator bacteria in surface waters is influenced by storm water runoff and can increase dramatically during rainfall events in comparison to baseline conditions  <cit> . similarly, we found an increase in the number of enterococci at three of the sampling sites after rainfall events . there was a substantial increase in enterococcal colony counts at jabiru island , paradise point  and coombabah  after rainfall events. these findings were confirmed by the mann-whitney test which showed that enterococcal counts after rainfall events differ significantly between the different locations; c4-c <dig>  compared to c1-c <dig> , . these counts were well above the usepa recommended level . according to the australian nhmrc guidelines these locations are categorised into the microbial water quality assessment category b , except for jabiru island , which was category c . category b indicates a 1-5% gastrointestinal illness risk and category c indicates a 5-10% gastrointestinal illness risk. in contrast, even though counts for the other sampling points, marina , sanctuary cove  and santa barbara  increased after rainfall, they were within the acceptable range for enterococci in fresh recreational water. table  <dig> lists the total enterococcal counts  for each of the sampling sites across the different sampling times.

these high counts can be explained by the transportation of faecal indicator bacteria by storm water run-off  <cit>  and soil leaching  <cit>  immediately after a rainfall event. storm water run-off occurs when rainfall is unable to infiltrate the soil surface  and runs over land to transport soil particles, faecal and associated bacteria  <cit> . increased urbanization and land usage changes in the south-east region of queensland, has had an adverse impact on the quality of natural water resources  <cit> . one potential source of bacterial contamination may be the accidental sewage discharge from a large number of yachts and houseboats owned by residents with boat-moorings in these waterways. furthermore, it is speculated that higher enterococcal counts at jabiru island , paradise point  and coombabah , compared, to marina , sanctuary cove  and santa barbara  may be due to their physical locations along the coomera river and the impact of their surroundings. at jabiru island , there is sand mine and the water is turbid particularly during rainfall periods. previous studies have demonstrated that indicator organisms attach to sand particles  <cit> . soil resuspension can be enhanced by rainfall, and as a result, higher enterococcal counts are possible. paradise point  is a highly populated area and is used for bathing primarily. at coombabah , there is a waste-water treatment plant near the sampling site, and during rainfall periods, it is possible that there is a mixing of the treatment plant effluent with surrounding water bodies which contributes to high enterococcal counts. in addition, sampling sites c4-c <dig> are located at the lower reaches of the coomera river, where enterococci can accumulate from the upstream regions of the river.

the diversity and the distribution of e. faecalis and e. faecium snp profiles in the coomera river
it is more important to focus on e. faecalis and e. faecium rather than the total enterococcal count as they pose a definite human health risk and are the predominant enterococcal species in human faeces and sewage. in total,  <dig> e. faecalis and  <dig> e. faecium strains were isolated from six different sampling sites along the coomera river. in this study, we applied a recently developed snp genotyping method to the coomera river to determine the diversity of e. faecalis and e. faecium genotypes. this method represents an efficient means of classifying e. faecalis and e. faecium into groups that are concordant with their population structure  <cit> . for the purpose of clarity, we define the snp profiles into two main groups. the first group is the human-specific snp profile group; these profiles are associated with enterococcal strains that originate from human samples only, as defined by the mlst database, as well as our previous study  <cit> . the second group is the human-related snp profile group; these profiles are associated with enterococcal strains that originate from mixed sources  according to the mlst database, but we found these profiles for enterococcal isolates from human specimens as well  <cit> .

the snp profiles of the coomera enterococcal strains were compared to known human-related and human-specific snp profiles described previously  <cit> . snp profiles were validated by gene sequencing using mlst primers for e. faecalis and e. faecium. enterococcal strains with new snp profiles  were also sequenced, and added to the mlst database . the coomera isolates were grouped into  <dig> and  <dig> snp profiles for e. faecalis and e. faecium respectively . these results confirm that the enterococcal population in the coomera river is diverse. figures  <dig> and  <dig> illustrate the distribution of these snp profiles at all sampling points over the two year study period. in addition, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium populations were more diverse during rainfall periods .

of all the snp profiles described in this study, six snp profiles actatgcc, atcaaacc, attaagct, attatgcc, gtcgtgtt and gttgagtc  of e. faecalis and five e. faecium snp profiles aacccttc, agcctttc, agctctcc, ggcccccc and ggccctcc  have previously been described and distributed amongst human strains in brisbane, australia  <cit> . snp profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> of e. faecalis and  <dig> of e. faecium have previously been found to correspond to not only human e. faecalis and e. faecium strains listed in the mlst database, but these snp profiles also include strains originating from other sources such as animals. these snp profiles are therefore classified as human-related snp profiles  <cit> . e. faecalis snp profile  <dig> and e. faecium snp profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are found only in humans and classified as human-specific. eburst analysis of both the e. faecalis and e. faecium mlst database, which now include the new sts found in this study, are included as additional file  <dig>  the new e. faecium sts, st <dig>  and st <dig> , found in this study are human-specific and not related to the major clonal complex- <dig> , as shown in the eburst diagram . a very important finding of this study was the isolation of e. faecium strains  with snp profile agctctcc  from water, as we have previously demonstrated that this is a human-specific snp profile which represents a major clonal complex- <dig>  of e. faecium strains that cause the majority of hospital outbreaks and clinical infections across five continents  <cit> . of major concern is the fact that the majority of the members of this cluster are vancomycin-resistant and cc <dig> strains are generally resistant to ampicillin and carry genes for putative virulence factors, such as esp  <cit> . the dissemination of these types of strains in natural waterways is of concern and further investigations are warranted to establish the genetic similarity between water e. faecium strains and those originating from clinical sources.

overall, these human-related and human-specific enterococcal snp profiles were found at jabiru island  and coombabah  after rainfall events, where the total enterococcal count was above the usepa acceptable level. a likely reason for this occurrence is the terrestrial run-off during high rainfall. in contrast, at paradise point, the human-related e. faecalis and e. faecium snp profiles were detected irrespective of rainfall. snp profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> of e. faecalis, and snp profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of e. faecium were found at paradise point. furthermore, snp profiles  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of e. faecalis and snp profile  <dig> of e. faecium were found in the absence of rain. in comparison to other sites, paradise point had the highest number of human-related and human-specific snp profiles. paradise point is primarily used for public bathing, and therefore the presence of these human-related and human-specific enterococcal snp profiles indicates human faecal contamination of this area.

antibiotic resistance profiles related to snp profiles
tables  <dig> and  <dig> summarize the antibiotic resistance profiles for the e. faecalis and e. faecium strains tested in this study. disc susceptibility results are included in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the outcome of the antimicrobial disc susceptibility tests followed by pcr, revealed that  <dig> % of e. faecalis snp profiles and  <dig> % of e. faecium snp profiles were associated with antibiotic resistance. the highest percentage of antibiotic resistant e. faecalis was found at paradise point   <dig> % followed by coombabah   <dig> %, jabiru island   <dig> %, marina   <dig> %, santa barbara   <dig> % and sanctuary cove   <dig> %. no antibiotic resistant e. faecium strains were found at marina  and sanctuary cove . the highest percentage of antibiotic resistant e. faecium was found at paradise point   <dig> % followed by coombabah   <dig> %, jabiru island   <dig> % and santa barbara   <dig> %. phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance profiles of e. faecalis and e. faecium at individual sampling sites are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

gentamicin resistance was more prevalent in e. faecalis  and these strains contained the aac-aph gene. whereas ciprofloxacin resistance is more common in e. faecium . according to previous studies, one of the factors used to determine ciprofloxacin resistance is the association with mutations in the dna gyrase genes  <cit> . the sequencing results revealed that there were no mutations detected in gyra gene of intermediate resistant strains, however, amino acid changes were detected in five e. faecium isolates that were disc-resistant to ciprofloxacin. amino acid changes at position  <dig>  were found in two isolates belonging to snp id  <dig>  whereas the remaining three isolates, belonging to snp id  <dig> and  <dig> had an amino acid change at position  <dig> . according to previous studies, glutamate at position  <dig> can also be replaced by glycine in ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, but this was not detected in our environmental isolates  <cit> . tetracycline resistance was less common among e. faecalis  and e. faecium  strains. of these, the tet and tet genes were the predominant genetic determinants. this finding is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . ampicillin resistance was found in only six e. faecium strains. ampicillin resistance was observed in both multi-drug resistant strains and in human-related strains. previous studies have shown an amino acid substitution in ampicillin-resistant enterococci. potentially significant mutations that confer ampicillin resistance are methionine to alanine substitution at position  <dig>  an additional serine at position  <dig>  and replacement of a polar amino acid with a non-polar one  at position  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  a glutamate to valine substitution at position  <dig> has also been associated with ampicillin resistance  <cit> . in the present study, an ampicillin-resistant e. faecium isolate with snp id  <dig> had alanine at position  <dig> and all the other ampicillin- resistant e. faecium strains had valine at position  <dig> . vancomycin resistance was not detected in any of the environmental isolates tested. multi-antibiotic resistance was found in both e. faecalis  and e. faecium . of these isolates, all e. faecalis harboured only two resistance genes. eight e. faecium isolates with snp ids  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> harbored more than three antibiotic resistance genes. however, it is interesting to note that snp id no.  <dig>  which represents cc <dig>  had multi-antibiotic resistance and contained the aac-aph gene and had mutations in the gyra and pbp <dig> genes. this supports the notion that members of cc <dig> are reservoirs of multidrug-resistance genes in the environment  <cit> . hospital snp profiles for both e. faecalis and e. faecium. , were antibiotic-resistant by both disc and pcr methods.

the snp profiles in bold text in tables  <dig> and  <dig> highlight the isolates that had the same snp profile but had different antibiotic-resistant gene profiles which resulted in sub-dividing the snp profiles. a possible explanation for this is that the snps interrogated by our method, are located in housekeeping genes, which are considered conservative, whereas, antibiotic resistance determinants are "mobile" except for the gyra and pbp <dig> genes. e. faecalis snp ids  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and e. faecium snp ids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were sub-divided into two groups. in addition, e. faecalis isolates with snp id  <dig> and e. faecium snp id  <dig> can be can be sub-divided in to three groups. these antibiotic-resistant profiles can be used to increase the resolving power of the snp typing method.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the prevalence and distribution of e. faecalis and e. faecium snp profile genotypes in the coomera river. the snp genotyping method demonstrates a high diversity in the e. faecalis and e. faecium population in the coomera river. in addition, at three sampling sites , the enterococcal counts were above the usepa acceptable levels after rainfall events. according to the australian nhmrc guidelines these sampling sites are category b and c areas according to the microbial water quality assessment , with category b indicating a 1-5% gastrointestinal illness risk and category c indicating a 5-10% gastrointestinal illness risk. we have also demonstrated the application of the snp genotyping method to identify both human-related and human-specific e. faecium and e. faecalis strains in environmental water sources. this method shows promise as a rapid and robust test to determine human faecal contamination of environmental water sources. some strains were antibiotic resistant and these antibiotic resistant profiles can be used as binary markers to increase the discriminatory power of the snp genotyping method.
