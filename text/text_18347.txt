BACKGROUND
cheeses harbour a diverse microbial community, composed of a resident “house flora”, that interacts with strains deliberately inoculated as starter or adjunct cultures . the cheese microorganisms mainly consist of firmicutes , actinobacteria , proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, yeasts and moulds. their concentration in the final product sometimes exceeds  <dig> cells per gram and it is generally accepted that most of them are cultivable in laboratory growth media . an inventory of microorganisms with a history of use in food fermentations was established recently  <cit> . it contains  <dig> bacterial species  and  <dig> yeast and mould species . among these bacterial species, only  <dig>  comprise at least one isolate for which a genome sequence isolated from food is available, with almost half of them within lactobacillus species . furthermore, this list cannot be considered as exhaustive of the cheese microbial diversity, since occurrences of species previously undetected in milk and cheese are periodically reported  and isolates affiliated to novel taxa characterized  <cit> . several species, such as corynebacterium casei, microbacterium gubbeenense, arthrobacter arilaitensis, arthrobacter bergerei, agrococcus casei, mycetocola reblochoni and vibrio casei appear to be endemic in the cheese habitat and the environment of cheese manufacturing . environmental reservoirs of cheese microbial diversity such as milk, cow teat, human skin, brine baths, ripening room air, wooden vessels and shelves on which the cheese rests during ripening, have been identified, but their microorganism content remains largely uncharacterised  <cit> . microbial communities of cheeses and dairy environments also represent largely unexplored reservoirs of genetic and metabolic diversity with potential beneficial use for fermented food production. an increase in the number of genome sequences of dairy bacteria is also useful for a better understanding of the genetic determinants involved in the adaptation to the dairy habitat and the generation of functional properties .

in recent years, high-throughput sequencing technologies and information technologies have allowed the development of new approaches for studying the genetic diversity of microbial communities. among these, metagenomics is a powerful tool for assessing the phylogenetic diversity of complex microbial assemblages present in samples such as soil, sediment, food products or water  <cit>  and for exploring the functional properties of their dominant populations. the characterization of metagenomic datasets relies on the use of reference databases that contain sequences of known origin and phenotype. many of these studies are carried out by pyrosequencing of single target genes, such as 16s rdna sequences, that provide information restricted to the phylogenetic composition of the samples . on the other hand, shotgun sequencing of whole community dna provides additional information about the functions performed by the microbial community  <cit> . the length of the reads generated by current high throughput sequencing technologies is too short to allow accurate comparative analyses against distantly related genomes, thus requiring the availability of reference genomes closely related to organisms from the environment being studied. currently, the international genome databases are biased towards model organisms and pathogens, and, according to huson et al.  <cit> , up to 90% of the sequences of a metagenomic dataset may remain unidentified due to the lack of adequate reference sequences. the sequencing of several hundred genomes is no longer a technical issue. however, this process still remains costly, mainly due to the cost of the construction of individual libraries for each genome being sequenced.

in the present study, we selected and sequenced  <dig> bacterial strains of dairy origin that belong to  <dig> different species and  <dig> genera. in order to exemplify the relevance of these new genomes to the understanding of food microbiota, we used the newly created catalog to analyse the microbiota of three cheese surfaces sequenced through whole metagenomic sequencing.

RESULTS
creation of a dairy reference genome catalog
after bibliographic investigation for bacterial species occurring in dairy products, we collected  <dig> dairy bacteria of various origins. the origin of the isolates and their taxonomy are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the collection comprised 36% gram negative bacteria, 35% low gc gram positive bacteria and 29% high gc gram positive bacteria. among the  <dig> corresponding genera, four are genera for which no genome sequence was available in ncbi databases : kluyvera, luteococcus, marinilactibacillus, and mycetocola. the distribution of the strains according to the type of dairy product and their geographic origin is shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
origin of the  <dig> selected dairy bacterial isolates in function of the type of dairy product  and the geographic area .




we designed a low-cost library sequencing strategy, by pooling the bacterial genomes together in a controlled way prior to sequencing in order to reduce library construction costs. unlike other approaches that rely on barcoding, we de-convolve the individual genomes by using a co-abundance approach as described in nielsen et al.  <cit>  and le chatelier et al.  <cit>  . this strategy involves a two-step procedure, as follows. in the first step, the dna of the  <dig> strains was mixed in five pools of about  <dig> strains each. to reduce the risk of chimeras each pool contained a mix of genomes from divergent genera . the pools were sequenced using illumina paired-end sequencing, and then assembled to produce five separate collections of contigs. in a second step, the genomes were redistributed into six pools of ~ <dig> strains each, which were sequenced using solid sequencing, and the resulting reads were mapped to the contigs generated in the first step in order to estimate the coverage of each contig within the stage  <dig> pools. we used solid sequencing due to the availability of this platform at our institution and the lower cost of sequencing. however, other low-cost approaches for estimating the coverage of stage  <dig> contigs within the stage  <dig> pools could be used, such as, e.g., short runs on illumina instruments. the resulting contig coverage matrix was then used to cluster together the contigs with correlated coverage profiles, each cluster corresponding to one of the original strains . the stage  <dig> pool assemblies contained each less than  <dig>  contigs with a mean contig size of  <dig> kbp . after the clustering procedure, more than 80% of the illumina contigs comprising more than 96% of the total length of contigs could be attributed to individual strains.

we assessed the quality of the clustering procedure by mapping the illumina contigs to the closest ncbi genome sequences . furthermore, one organism in our collection - arthrobacter arilaitensis re <dig> – had already been sequenced and was added to one sequencing pool in order to validate the clustering procedure. we evaluated the correctness of contig clusters by computing two measures: the dominant genus - the percentage of the contigs that could be mapped to related genomes belonging to the same genus as the organism represented by the cluster; and the reference coverage - percentage of the total contig size of the pool that could be mapped to a genome from the dominant genus. we performed this analysis for the  <dig> draft genomes for which we could identify at least five genomes belonging to the same genus in the ncbi database. for these genomes, the mean dominant genus assignment and reference coverage percentage were of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . the dominant genus assignment indicated that only  <dig> % of the total length of the genomes may have been mis-assigned by the clustering procedure. the reference coverage indicated that on average  <dig> % of the length of each genome may be missing. the potentially missing information is likely present in the 4% of the fragments that were not assigned and contain mostly repeated sequences. we performed an optimized re-assembly procedure for each draft genome, in order to increase contig size and recover eventual missing parts of the genomes . interestingly, the optimized re-assembly process halved the number of contigs and increased slightly the total contig size of genomes for which close references were available, such as genomes of the genera leuconostoc and streptococcus. in order to further assess the quality of the draft genomes , we relied on the six quality submission criteria established by the human microbiome project   <cit> , plus two additional criteria that identify potential miss-assignment events during the clustering step: phylogenetic marker redundancy and tetranucleotide homogeneity. for the hmp draft genome quality criteria,  <dig> criteria correspond to contig and scaffold assembly length and coverage . the last hmp quality criteria checks the presence of  <dig> bacterial essential genes  <cit> , which gives an indication of the proportion of the genome that has been assembled . the phylogenetic marker redundancy tests the redundancy of  <dig> protein markers expected to be conserved in all bacteria, not laterally transferable and not duplicated within a genome  <cit> . the tetranucleotide homogeneity tests the homogeneity of the tetranucleotide signature among all the contigs of a draft genome.  <dig> genomes passed the essential genes hmp criterion and the two additional criteria for mis-assignment detection, indicating that  <dig> genomes are almost complete with no mis-assignment evidence . among these,  <dig> passed all the quality criteria and were defined as high quality draft genomes. an example is the genome of jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus crbm d <dig>  which was assembled in only  <dig> contigs and  <dig> scaffolds, and had a contig n <dig> size of 103 kb. sixteen additional assemblies presented incomplete sets of the hmp essential genes criterion but passed the two chimeric test criteria. for the  <dig> remaining draft genomes,  <dig> were too incomplete  and  <dig> did not pass one of the two chimeric criteria. the genome of arthrobacter arilaitensis re <dig>  <cit> , which was used in pool  <dig> as control for the procedure, passed all the hmp and chimeric criteria, and a comparison with the previously sequenced genome  showed an average identity of  <dig> %, a completion level of  <dig> % and the absence of improperly assigned contigs. the two plasmids present in this bacterium were also partially present in our draft. the missing sequences corresponded mainly to transposase regions which were not assembled possibly due to the assembly and clustering procedure which often has difficulties reconstructing repeated variable regions. in total  <dig> of the draft genome sequences  were considered suitable for submission to public databases . the  <dig> draft genomes with poor quality or possible contamination were not submitted to public databases, but were used in our project with caution for phylogenetic analyses.

from the  <dig> bacterial species or subspecies listed by bourdichon et al.  <cit>  to occur in food products, only  <dig> had at least one food isolate for which a genome sequence was available in the ncbi database . the present study provides genome sequences for  <dig> additional dairy isolates, which effectively doubles the number of available genome sequences of relevance to the study of fermented dairy products.

in order to better characterize the diversity of the bacterial strains studied here, we reconstructed their phylogenetic relationships. for that purpose, the genes corresponding to the  <dig> phylogenetic protein markers proposed by mende et al.  <cit>  were extracted from the  <dig> high quality draft genomes in order to build a phylogenetic tree . the tree shows that the selected bacterial isolates cover a large biodiversity. four other trees were constructed  by inclusion of  <dig> genomic sequences from food-related bacteria or closely-related species  extracted from the ncbi database . the classifications of the genomes sequenced in the present study are consistent with the ncbi reference genomes, further confirming the correctness of our reconstruction. in some cases, for example for alkalibacterium kapii, marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and luteococcus japonicus, only distant ncbi reference genomes are available, highlighting the contribution of our study.figure  <dig>

genomics of cheese bacteria
the high quality draft sequences can be used to perform comparative genomic studies aimed at understanding the genetic underpinnings of the adaptation of bacteria to the food environment, e.g., through the characterization of metabolic pathways. here we compared the genomes of strains from dairy and non-dairy environments for two genera. in a first example, we compared the genomic sequences of the four arthrobacter strains isolated from cheese to that of  <dig> environmental isolates. most bacteria of the genus arthrobacter are isolated from environments such as soil, where they are considered to be ubiquitous  <cit> . interestingly, the four cheese strains share several properties that may be linked to adaptation to the cheese habitat, such as a cluster of five genes involved in the catabolism of d-galactonate, as already described in arthrobacter arilaitensis re <dig>  <cit> . this gene cluster is absent from the genomes of the  <dig> arthrobacter strains of environmental origin for which a sequence is available . it has been hypothesized that d-galactonate may be produced by yeasts from lactose during the ripening of cheeses, and the ability to catabolize this compound could thus be beneficial for arthrobacter strains in cheeses  <cit> .

as a second example, we compared the genomes of two strains of streptococcus infantarius isolated from western african fermented milks, sequenced in this work , with those of the type strain isolated from infant feces , and of strain cj <dig>  isolated from eastern african fermented milk. the four strains contain each 1900– <dig> genes and share  <dig> genes. the strains could be divided into two groups, the two western african strains, which displayed  <dig> % identity on average within the shared genes , and the infant feces and the eastern african strains, which displayed  <dig> % identity  . the strains of the two different groups displayed only  <dig> % identity and fewer than  <dig> fully identical genes, confirming a clear separation between the western african food strain and the two others. further study of the gene content of the two western african streptococcus infantarius strains showed that these strains had acquired the ability to ferment lactose through the laczs system, as previously described for eastern african strain cj <dig>  <cit> . however, these genes are located within different regions of the chromosome and originate from a different donor. while laczs may originate from s. thermophilus in the eastern african cj <dig> strain  <cit> , it has probably been acquired from s. salivarius in the two western africa strains . these data show that adaptation of s. infantarius to the dairy fermentation niches occurred convergently and independently in these strains isolated respectively in eastern and western africa.

application of the new genomic catalog to the metagenomic analysis of cheese microbiota
metagenomic analyses based on sequence mapping on a set of reference genomes can be used to identify and quantify genes and species  <cit> . to determine whether the addition of the new genome sequences to the  <dig> publicly available genomes  could improve such analyses, we sequenced the microbial communities from the rind of three cheeses with protected designation of origin. these three cheeses were made from cow’s milk and correspond to two soft smear-ripened cheeses , and one blue-veined cheese . extracted dna was sequenced by solid technology and reads were assigned to species by mapping them to the reference microbial genomes and to the genome of bos taurus .

the sequencing of the three samples provided from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million good quality reads . the percentage of good quality reads mapping to the microbial reference genomes varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . interestingly, the reads that mapped only to the dairy genomes sequenced in the present study accounted for a large proportion of the good quality reads . in cheese g,  <dig> % of the reads mapped to the bos taurus genome . a deeper investigation of the cheese e good quality unmapped reads indicated that they may correspond to  strain specific genes belonging to the pan-genome  and/or missing regions of the draft genomes,  microorganisms for which genomes are still absent from the databases,  distant genomic regions containing indels or more than  <dig> mismatches, which cannot be mapped with bowtie. lastly, ~20% of “technically good reads” on average are inherently un-mappable due to the characteristics of the solid technology . the most prevalent microorganisms detected in the three cheeses are presented in table  <dig> and a more detailed composition is shown in additional file 14: table s <dig> figure  <dig> 
mapping of the good quality reads from the metagenomic sequencing of dna from the surfaces of three cheeses. the good quality reads coming from  <dig> samples of cheese surface were aligned to  <dig> genomes coming from ncbi and  <dig> genomes coming from our project. the repartition of the good quality reads that map only on the ncbi genomes , on the genome sequenced in our project , on both ncbi and our genome  and on bos taurus genome  is presented in pie charts. the unmapped good reads are presented in dark and light grey, respectively those lacking a reference and those potentially unmappable for technical reason.

 genomes sequenced in the present study  or from the ncbi database .

 species known to be components of cheese making commercial cultures.

 number of reads mapped on cds from the reference genome with three or less mismatches on  <dig> nucleotides.

 number of cds in the genome. cds corresponding to insertion sequences, prophages and potential repeated and transferable elements were removed.

 percentage of cds covered with at least one read.

 percentage of sequence covered by at least one read .

 number of reads aligned with this genome divided by the number of good quality reads.

 length of sequence covered by perfect match reads  divided by the length of the sequence covered by reads.

for each cheese, the data presented correspond to the eight reference genomes with the highest numbers of mapped reads.

in the smear-ripened cheese e, the arthrobacter arilaitensis gmpa <dig> reference genome was the most represented, as it corresponded to  <dig> % of the total good quality reads, followed by psychrobacter immobilis pg <dig> and vibrio litoralis b <dig>  with  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the reads, respectively. furthermore, between  <dig>  and  <dig> % of their coding sequences were detected, with a high level of coverage . the genomes of arthrobacter arilaitensis gmpa <dig> and psychrobacter immobilis pg <dig> are almost entirely covered , showing that the detected strains were closely related to the reference strains. the reference strain psychrobacter immobilis pg <dig> was isolated from the dairy plant that produces the smear-ripened cheese e, but two years earlier. the high proportion of perfect matches with reference strain pg <dig> may thus be explained by the presence of an offspring of this strain in cheese e. many reads were also assigned to the genomes of the yeasts geotrichum candidum clib  <dig> and debaryomyces hansenii cbs <dig> 

in the second smear-ripened cheese , pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis tac <dig>  halomonas sp. 1 m <dig> and psychrobacter celer  <dig> were the three dominant reference bacteria, with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the good quality matches, respectively. in this cheese sample, the sequences of the reads mapped to halomonas sp. 1 m <dig> were essentially perfect matches . these data suggest that the halomonas strains present in the cheese sample are almost identical to the reference strain. however, even though the reference strain 1 m <dig> has also been isolated from a smear-ripened cheese of the same protected designation of origin, it originated from another manufacturing plant. more than fifty thousand reads were assigned to providencia heimbachae gr <dig>  however, only  <dig> % of covered positions of this reference strain are without mismatch, which indicates that the strain present in the cheese sample is not closely related to the reference strain, and may even correspond to another species. surprisingly, more than  <dig> thousand reads  mapped to the penicillium camemberti fm  <dig> genome, with  <dig> % of perfect match reads, even though this species is not known to occur in smear-ripened cheeses. one may hypothesize that this could result from cross-contamination due to the manufacturing of mould-ripened cheese in the same plant.

the surface of the blue-veined cheese g was dominated by a strain close to arthrobacter bergerei ca <dig> . like for the two other cheeses, psychrobacter species seem to be present in this cheese. cheese g was probably manufactured with a thermophilic lactic starter culture, since streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii species were the dominant lactic acid bacteria, in contrast to the two other cheeses, in which lactococcus lactis was the dominant lactic acid bacterium. strains related to other reference strains sequenced in the present study, such as psychrobacter aquimaris, brachybacterium tyrofermentans, corynebacterium ammoniagenes, brevibacterium antiquum, microbacterium gubbeenense, brochothrix thermosphacta and marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans, were also present in the cheeses . interestingly, among the eight most prevalent microorganisms detected in each cheese by metagenomic analysis, two , four  or five  corresponded to species or genera of gram-negative bacteria which are not known components of cheesemaking commercial cultures .

discussion
in the present work, we produced  <dig> draft genomes isolated from dairy products, which almost doubled the number of different species isolated from fermented dairy products. this genome catalog was realized using a low-cost library sequencing strategy based on a combinatorial pooling approach in which a reduced number of dna pools were sequenced. pooling strategies have been previously been used to reduce costs for bac sequencing  <cit> . here we rely on a co-abundance clustering approach that we developed for reconstructing genomes directly from metagenomic samples  <cit> . in the present pooled approach, only  <dig> libraries were required to produce  <dig> draft genomes, leading to a cost of ~ <dig> usd per genome as opposed to ~ <dig> usd if each genome were sequenced separately . today, this price differential may be even higher as library construction costs have not decreased as much as sequencing costs. this cost savings comes with some limitations. first, we suggest that only distant genomes  should be mixed and sequenced together to optimize the assembly and clustering steps. second, several genomes were poorly sequenced, however most of them were high gc% draft genome, known to be difficult to sequence using illumina sequencing  <cit> . also, about 4% of the total sequence length could not be assigned to an individual strain and we estimated that on average 2% of a genome’s sequence may be mis-assigned due to limitations of the clustering approach. however, an examination of unassigned fragments > 2 kb showed that they correspond mainly to mobile elements  while genome data curation showed that potentially mis-assigned fragments are generally < 1 kb, and primarily impact genomes of lower quality. this fact prompts us to suggest that the use of these drafts for comparative genomics should be restricted to high quality draft genomes and to genes present in long contigs or scaffolds . lastly, the bioinformatics analysis pipeline is more complex to set up than simple assembly procedure in single genome sequencing. despite these limitations,  <dig> of the  <dig> sequenced genomes resulted in good or high quality draft genomes suitable for submission to public database. some of the remaining  <dig> genomes may still be useful as references for metagenomic analyses.

the microbial composition of the surfaces of three cheeses was investigated by high throughput metagenomic profiling. as all the dna present in the cheese samples is sequenced, the high throughput sequencing may detect any type of dna , provided that adequate references are used. eukaryotes, such as geotrichum candidum, debaryomyces hansenii, and penicillium roqueforti, were found, which was not surprising, as these fungi are frequently used in cheesemaking. interestingly, many reads from cheese g mapped on the bos taurus genome. we hypothesize that this is due to the presence of cow somatic cells in the milk used for the manufacturing of cheese g. the impact of milk somatic cells on the ripening of cheeses has been shown in several studies as associated to the flock health  <cit> .

shotgun sequencing allows a relative quantification of dna molecules present in a sample, based on counting the number of reads mapped to each member of the community. high throughput sequencing allows higher resolution quantitation and we have shown that we can recover even fairly minor taxonomi groups, such as the leuconostoc genus , known to be part of the minority population in cheeses  <cit> . however, additional experiments may be needed to validate the identification and quantitation of low abundance populations.

presence or absence of complete set of genes or of specific genes, and their level of sequence homology allows also confirming characteristics of particular strains. for example, cheeses e and l metagenomic profiles indicated the presence of strains closely related, respectively, to psychrobacter immobilis pg <dig> and halomonas sp. 1 m <dig> coming from our catalog. since these reference strains were isolated in the same cheese factory several years earlier for the former and in the same dop from another factory for the later, our analysis would reflect the setting up of strains sharing common origins with the references in these cheeses. metagenomic profiling provides thus new perspectives to study cheese ecology by tracing genomes or genes, which should allow pointing out particular strains , and following their dissemination and development during cheese processes.

the metagenomic profiling of the surfaces of the three cheeses confirmed that microorganisms that are not deliberately inoculated constitute a large part of the microbiota, appearing among the few dominant species in cheese rind. for example, they are predominant in cheese l. several of the corresponding microorganisms, such as pseudoalteromonas, halomonas, vibrio, marinilactibacillus and psychrobacter are gram-negative bacteria which had been previously detected in such cheeses, and also in a recent large amplicon sequencing study of the microbial composition of  <dig> different cheese rinds  <cit> . they may originate from the environment of cheese manufacturing , and their high abundance suggests that they may have an impact on the properties of the final product. as the analysed cheeses were marketed and were of very good quality, these microorganisms cannot be considered here as spoilers.

CONCLUSIONS
the genomes sequenced in the present study considerably increased the numbers of mapped reads, although a significant proportion of the metagenomic reads remained unassigned . these data indicate that even if more than  <dig> genomes are currently available in public databases , additional microorganisms found in traditional cheeses are still missing from this reference collection. further studies are necessary to complete this reference in order to provide a complete view of the cheese ecosystem. to our surprise, collecting the present reference strain set constituted a laborious work, since strains corresponding to non-starter species are frequently not conserved once described. we anticipate that the results of this work will motivate isolation and conservation of new reference strains, as well as independent isolates of the same species to support safety assessment, establish biodiversity resource and strain specificity in products. direct sequencing and assembly as performed for the human microbiome could also provide new potential references  <cit> , although this procedure is significantly more expensive. in summary, the present study considerably extended the effectiveness of shotgun metagenomic analysis of cheese microbiota. even if such analyses require generating and computing large amounts of sequencing data, the technologies are evolving rapidly and one may anticipate that in the future, they will become routine in the investigation of food microbiota.
