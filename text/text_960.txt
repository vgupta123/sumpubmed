BACKGROUND
the atlantic cod  is a cold-adapted fish species which has been captured for human consumption for many years. it is a perishable commodity and for that reason, preservation methods like freezing or salting have traditionally been used to extend its shelf life  <cit> .

the fish is a microbial ecosystem of its own where the ecological principles of succession are as valid as in any other ecosystem. this microbiological environment consists of a high nutrient content with an oxygen tension favourable to the proliferation of fast-growing heterotrophs also responsible for the spoilage of food  <cit> . until now, the process of fish spoilage has been investigated intensively with regard to sensory evaluation, chemical changes of volatile and non-volatile compounds and microbiological growth by cultivation methods  <cit> .

pseudomonas spp. and shewanella putrefaciens were early recognised as putative spoilage inducers in fish muscle and have since then been found in various fish species from fresh- and marine waters as well as in other foods  <cit> . these species are generally associated with spoilage of fish stored under aerobic conditions while photobacterium phosphoreum has been reported as the main spoilage organism in modified atmosphere  packed fish, being co2-tolerant and producing trimethylamine  from trimethylamine oxide  <cit> . p. phosphoreum is not as easily cultivated as many other heterotrophs found in fish, as it is vulnerable to temperature fluctuations  <cit> . the importance of this species during the spoilage of fish was therefore identified later both in map  <cit>  and air-stored fish products  <cit> . however, storage under superchilled conditions delayed p. phosphoreum development in cod fillets while h2s-producing bacteria, most likely sh. putrefaciens, were not affected and reached high levels  <cit> . the spoilage organisms involved in any given fish can vary among fish species and its habitat. other bacterial species have also been associated with fish spoilage, e.g. brochothrix thermosphacta, aeromonas spp., vibrio spp. and enterobacteriaceae  <cit> .

until recently, most studies dealing with food microbiology of fish have used conventional cultivation methods for estimation of bacterial growth. in recent years, the use of molecular methodology has increased enormously where microbiological diversity has been documented with cultivation independent methods  <cit> . the abundance of selected species has furthermore been monitored with the use of specific detection methods such as real-time pcr  <cit> .

the work presented here was performed in parallel to a larger shelf life trial assessing the effects of brining, ma packaging and superchilling on the shelf life and quality parameters of cod loins using conventional sensory, chemical and microbiological methods  <cit> . the aim of the present study was to examine the bacterial succession that occurs during storage of cod loins differently treated and stored under various conditions specifically using cultivation independent approach and compare it against conventional cultivation methods.

RESULTS
temperature and gas measurements
during the storage trials, the average ambient temperature in the three coolers was  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c; - <dig>  ±  <dig> °c and - <dig>  ±  <dig> °c. these groups were therefore called  <dig>  - <dig> and -4°c groups. average loin temperature in the polystyrene boxes was  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c , - <dig>  ±  <dig> °c  and - <dig>  ±  <dig> °c . in these boxes, fish temperature of the 0°c group reached target temperature on the packaging day, the -2°c group on day  <dig> and the -4°c group on day  <dig>  the average gas composition in ma packages at the beginning of the experiment was co2/o2/n2:  <dig>  ±  <dig> / <dig>  ±  <dig> / <dig>  ±  <dig> . after  <dig> week storage a decrease of co <dig>  was detected in all packages but after that the gas composition remained essentially the same.

bacterial counts by cultivation during storage
quality of the processed raw material  was evaluated upon packaging and the total psychrotrophic load  was found to contain less than  <dig> colony forming units /g. initial pseudomonas spp. load was tenfold lower  and h2s-producing bacteria almost 100-fold lower than tvc . p. phosphoreum was not detected  in newly packaged cod loins. generally, air storage at -2°c did not inhibit bacterial growth compared to storage at 0°c whereas storage at -4°c clearly showed a reduced growth throughout the storage time . in map fish, storage temperature clearly influenced bacterial growth, with an increased delay as temperature decreased. monitoring of p. phosphoreum showed a reduction in growth with lower temperatures, especially when combined with ma .

pseudomonas spp. showed an increasing growth during storage in air, both at  <dig> and -2°c, but with some delay at -4°c. map had a biostatic effect on pseudomonads development, resulting in constant counts  at all temperatures. similar trends could be seen during storage of brined  fish where combining ma and lower temperature storage generally inhibited bacterial growth . relative ratio of selected spoilage organisms showed a large variation of dominance. pseudomonas spp. were usually in high proportional concentrations during air storage  and at lower concentrations during ma storage. however, on day  <dig> at -4°c in ma storage, pseudomonas spp. reached a level of 33% of the flora in both the ls and hs groups. p. phosphoreum was at low relative concentrations  except during ma storage at 0°c where it reached up to nearly 100% .

1abundancy was calculated by dividing the peak area of the p. phosphoreum peak by the total peak area in the t-rflp profile. the data was generated from analysis of reverse labelled tf and digestion with alui.

bacterial community development during storage by 16s rrna clone analysis
partial sequence analysis of  <dig> 16s rrna clones from  <dig> samples in the shelf life experiment was performed . pcr and cloning of two samples failed . the identity of the closest relatives in the ncbi database had in most cases a similarity of 95-100%. in the study,  <dig> different bacterial species were found, with  <dig> of them identified to the species level,  <dig> to the genus level and two unclassified genera. the estimated coverage of bacteria within a sample ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

 <dig> accession numbers of flavobacterium spp. sequences: dq <dig>  dq <dig>  am689970

in general, the analysis revealed a high dominance of photobacterium in all samples except in newly packaged cod loins  where it was not detected. at packaging, the microflora of cod loins was dominated by sphingomonas spp. and ps. fluorescens while variovorax spp. and bradyrhizobium spp. were present at lower levels .

a trend towards the succession of p. phosphoreum with time during storage was seen in all storage conditions. slower succession of p. phosphoreum was observed in samples stored in air than in ma. after six days of aerobic storage, the dominance of p. phosphoreum was between  <dig> and 71% and other bacterial species were present in lower numbers, e.g. pseudomonas spp., shewanella spp., acinetobacter spp., psychrobacter spp., vibrio logei, moritella spp., and pseudoalteromonas spp. after further storage , near the end of shelf life, p. phosphoreum increased its relative dominance up to 83-95% of the population .

the bacterial flora of fish stored under ma was dominated by p. phosphoreum, reaching levels of 91-100% of the population at all sampling times with one exception  where the dominance was 53% with other species in high relative quantity, including chryseobacterium and flavobacterium spp. . when the same group had been stored for  <dig> days the bacterial flora was composed of 91% p. phosphoreum .

most of the bacteria detected belong to the gammaproteobacteria division, including the ssos, while bacteriodetes, alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria had also representatives in the bacterial flora. phylogenetic relationship between the species detected in the 16s rrna analysis from all samples was depicted along with the division classification .

bacterial diversity during storage by t-rflp
the number of operating taxonomic units  was different between combinations of labelled primers and restriction enzymes. analysis of forward tfs coupled with haeiii digestion resulted in  <dig> otus compared to  <dig> otus with alui in all samples analysed. the reverse tfs coupled with haeiii or alui digestion resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> otus, respectively. principal component analysis  of tf profiles showed a clear difference of the bacterial flora of newly packaged cod loins  compared to other samples . excluding the d0-samples from the analysis, a better resolution between other samples in the study was established . it showed that all samples stored under ma clustered tightly together regardless of storage time, temperature or salt content. the samples stored under air showed a trend towards the map cluster with the exception of the  <dig> hs samples being situated at an opposite position in the score plot. therefore, the first principal component  distinguishes the air-stored hs samples from other samples while pc <dig> seems to separate the air-stored ls samples from early storage time  to late storage , where the latter clusters with other air-stored and map samples .

in this analysis pc <dig> explained 44% of the variability and pc <dig> 26%. except for the d0-samples, p. phosphoreum dominated the bacterial flora in all samples, with  <dig> % up to 100% abundance  when analysing the t-rflp profile of labelled forward primer and alui digestion. using this primer/restriction enzyme combination and analysing the sequence data of the clone library it was evident that a peak of  <dig> base pairs derived only from p. phosphoreum and vibrio logei. other combinations had more species with common terminal restriction site as p. phosphoreum.

gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
chromatographic profile of volatile compounds produced during the storage was obtained for ls fish stored at -2°c . on the second day of storage, only a few compounds were detected  and tma was absent but their quantities increased during the storage period. tma was produced in largest amounts at later stages while substances such as 3-hydroxy-2-butanone  were in relatively high quantities in both air and map samples. ethyl acetate was also produced in high quantities but only in the air storage. other volatile compounds were detected in lower amounts and are summarised in table  <dig> according to their retention indices.

discussion
molecular analyses on bacterial communities in food have only been applied for few years  <cit> . this paper describes the bacterial population developments during storage of cod loins at chilled and superchilled temperatures using both cultivation and cultivation independent approaches.

the molecular methods showed that the flora was directed towards the dominance of p. phosphoreum. more diversity was generally seen in early storage in air while during late storage, all samples showed a similar bacterial composition dominated by p. phosphoreum. the pca analysis of t-rflp patterns indicated that the higher salt content of air-stored products contributed to a different dominating bacterial flora as compared to other treatments since those samples were plotted outside the core pattern in the pca analysis . p. phosphoreum was found to be below the detection level at the beginning of the storage trial, but as soon as the fish had been stored for 6- <dig> days, it showed an abundance of 53-100% among the population by 16s rrna cloning analysis. cultivation generally showed higher proportional levels of pseudomonas spp. than p. phosphoreum in all storage conditions with few exceptions. it has been shown with cultivation that ma packaging enabled p. phosphoreum growth in fish products  <cit>  while other bacterial species can dominate as well during air storage  <cit> . the present study confirms its abundance in ma conditions and its ability to dominate under aerobic environmental condition. p. phosphoreum has been shown to be able to reach high numbers in aerobically stored fish such as cod, squid and haddock  <cit> . in previous shelf life studies on cod and haddock from iceland, p. phosphoreum counts have most often been higher than pseudomonas spp. counts  <cit>  but that was not the case in this study.

discrepancy between pcr strategies and cultivation is a known phenomenon where both approaches are subjective to some degree of bias  <cit> . cultivation can be biased to some extent because of different optimal growth conditions and competition between bacterial species in the culture medium, and importantly due to the presence of viable but non-cultivable cells  <cit> . the malthus conductance method is based on other principles than colony counts on agar media and the harsh condition  of the p. phosphoreum method might underestimate their quantity in superchilled, map products. as shown in this study, superchilled condition delays the growth rate of p. phosphoreum and this effect is enhanced under ma . it is therefore likely that some p. phosphoreum cells from these superchilled products may be partly damaged or in such a physiological state that it prolongs the lag phase and/or slows down the growth rate, hence prolonging detection time and giving lower counts during the malthus incubation. with the molecular approaches, the bias can be derived from the 16s rrna copy numbers per bacterial genome. data on 16s rrna copy number in the p. phosphoreum genome is not available but its close relative, p. profundum contains  <dig> copies while ps. fluorescens and sh. putrefaciens contain  <dig> and  <dig> copies, respectively . other factors such as different dna extraction efficiency on different species or incongruity in the "universal" priming sites can also influence the outcome  <cit> .

the microbiological activity in a fish muscle ultimately leads to its spoilage where different bacterial species contribute to the process in different ways. pseudomonas spp. produce nh <dig>  esters and sulphur compounds, sh. putrefaciens produces tma, h2s, hypoxantine and other sulphur compounds and p. phosphoreum is able to produce hypoxantine, alcohols, tma and ketones in particular acetoin  <cit> . these organisms are often found in small quantities in newly processed fish but typically reach high numbers during storage. comparing the composition of microbial species and of volatile compounds it is evident that tma is the most abundant volatile in mid- and late storage  which supports the dominance of p. phosphoreum. acetoin was also detected which can be linked to the presence of p. phosphoreum  <cit> . pseudomonas spp. and sh. putrefaciens have been found responsible for the formation of volatiles sulfides, alcohols  and ketones   <cit>  but these volatiles were in low quantities compared to tma and acetoin in cod loins which is in agreement with earlier studies on cod fillets  <cit> .

the composition of the natural bacterial flora of a newly caught fish is dependent on its origin and season  <cit> . therefore it could be expected that p. phosphoreum is more likely to dominate the microflora of fish in northern seas than from warmer areas. nevertheless, detection and importance of p. phosphoreum in some mediterranean ma-packed fish products have been reported  <cit> . the natural flora in the epidermis mucosa of newly caught north-atlantic cod has been characterised using 16s clone analysis, revealing photobacterium, psychrobacter, pseudomonas, acinetobacter, pseudoalteromonas, and flavobacterium among the commonly found species on cod epidermis  <cit> . it was reported that psychrobacter spp. was the most abundant species of a 16s rrna clone library followed by photobacterium spp. in cod caught in the baltic, icelandic and north seas. the bacterial flora of farmed cod from norway was recently assessed using pcr denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  and it was shown that photobacterium spp., sh. putrefaciens and pseudomonas spp. dominated in ma and air while pseudomonas spp. were solely in dominance in oxygen enriched atmosphere during storage  <cit> . however, in salt-cured cod the dominating bacteria was found to be psychrobacter spp., representing more than 90% of the bacterial flora  <cit> .

other bacterial species detected in the study have been isolated and identified from various sources. janthinobacterium lividum is an aerobic bacterium commonly isolated from the microbiota of soils and water of rivers, lakes and springs  <cit> . the importance of flavobacterium in fish spoilage has not been reported and they are usually overgrown by pseudomonas spp. as shown in fish spoilage model systems  <cit> . flavobacterium subspecies have been found in other fish species such as catfish and some are also the causative agent of bacterial cold water disease and rainbow trout fry syndrome  <cit> . sphingomonas spp. have been identified in marine waters and in meat processing plants at high levels with molecular based identification  <cit> . sphingomonas and variovorax have also been isolated from deep sea sediments  <cit> . moritella spp. have been found in marine fish, e.g. moritella viscosa which is a fish pathogen  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present work describes an investigation of the succession of the dominating bacterial species during storage of unbrined and brined cod loins at chilled and superchilled temperatures under aerobic and ma conditions. cultivation on selective media indicates a slight dominance of pseudomonas spp. in air-stored samples at low temperatures while molecular based methods, both 16s rrna cloning analysis and t-rflp, indicate a high dominance of p. phosphoreum in both air and ma packaging. analysis of volatiles produced during storage at -2°c supported the dominance of p. phosphoreum showing intense tma production. the species diversity was higher after short storage of less than one week, especially in air packaging, but with time, p. phosphoreum reached a high dominance, depending on the storage conditions. discrepancy was observed between the conventional cultivation and molecular methods and requests a further investigation to elucidate this matter. nevertheless, combined strategy of cultivation and cultivation independent methods might be the key for deeper understanding of bacterial population developments during the spoilage process of food.
