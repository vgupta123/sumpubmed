BACKGROUND
acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophilic, chemolithoautotrophic γ-proteobacterium that uses energy and electrons derived from the oxidation of ferrous iron ) and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds  for carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation and other anabolic processes. it is a member of a consortium of microorganisms used for industrial copper recovery  and gold recovery  and contributes to the geobiochemical recycling of metals and nutrients in pristine and contaminated acid-rich environments.

when a. ferrooxidans requires reducing power it is confronted by a particularly challenging bioenergetic problem because the standard reduction half-potential of the fe/fe couple  is much more positive than that of the nad/nadh couple . this means that electrons have to be "pushed uphill" from fe to nad against the redox potential gradient . the energy to accomplish this was proposed to come from the proton motive force that naturally occurs across the periplasmic membrane of a. ferrooxidans . it was further suggested that protons, entering the cell through a membrane associated atp synthetase, could be consumed during the reduction of oxygen to water  in which electrons for this reaction come from the oxidation of fe in a pathway that is thermodynamically favorable . these ideas were first promulgated based upon theoretical considerations by ingledew  <cit>  but the model has been extended more recently and major parts of it are now supported by experimental evidence .

according to the model , components involved in the downhill electron pathway from fe to oxygen include: an outer membrane high molecular-weight cytochrome c encoded by cyc <dig>  a gene of unknown function , a periplasmic soluble blue copper protein rusticyanin encoded by rus, a periplasmic membrane-bound dihemic cytochrome c <dig> encoded by cyc <dig> and a terminal cytochrome oxidase of the aa3-type encoded by the coxbacd gene cluster  <cit> . in a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> these genes are cotranscribed in an eight gene transcriptional unit, termed the rus operon that is upregulated in fe-grown cells  <cit> . gene context analysis of the recently annotated genomic sequence of a. ferrooxidans type strain atcc  <dig> demonstrates that the rus operon is similarly organized in this strain  <cit> .

the uphill components include: a cytochrome bc <dig> complex , the quinone pool and a nadh <dig> dehydrogenase complex  functioning in reverse  <cit> . genetic and biophysical evidence obtained for a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> support this view  <cit> . in these two strains, the genes encoding the bc <dig> complex have been shown to be part of a five-gene operon, termed the peti operon, mainly transcribed in fe conditions and organized as following: a diheme cytochrome c <dig> , a short-chain dehydrogenase  of unknown function, a cytochrome b , an iron-sulfur protein rieske , and a cytochrome c <dig>   <cit> . based on the cotranscription of the diheme cytochrome c <dig> gene  with those encoding the bc <dig> complex, it was proposed that electrons from the diheme cytochrome c <dig> take a thermodynamically uphill pathway via the bc <dig> complex to a nadh complex driven energetically by proton motive force  <cit>  . adjacent to the peti operon, is a three gene  operon in which resbc are predicted to be chaperones involved in heme insertion in c-type cytochromes, possibly those involved in the maturation of the c <dig> cytochrome of the bc <dig> complex  <cit> . the peti operon is similarly organized and transcribed in a. ferrooxidans atcc  <dig>  <cit>  supporting this model.

the bifurcation in the flow of electrons from fe to reduce either nad  or o <dig>  has been proposed to occur at the level of rusticyanin, a small periplasmic blue copper protein  <cit>  . by adjusting the flow of electrons at this branch point, it was suggested that a. ferrooxidans could balance its requirements for nadh and atp  <cit> .

the components involved in both the uphill and downhill electron flow have been shown to form a fe-oxidizing/o2-reducing supercomplex spanning both inner and outer membranes in an unnamed strain of a. ferrooxidans  <cit>  supporting previous models. the supercomplex has also been suggested to include a copper containing protein  physically associated with the periplasmic cyc <dig> that is proposed to be involved in downhill electron flow. in addition, in vitro reconstitution of the iron oxidation system of the a. ferrooxidans type strain with rusticyanin, aa3-type cytochrome oxidase, the cytochromes c cyc <dig> and cyc <dig> has been reported recently  <cit> .

despite progress in understanding iron oxidation in the acidithiobacillus genus, several lacunae in our knowledge persist, such as the identification of components involved in the proposed connection between the bc1/quinone complex and the nadh complex, the identification of the chaperones used for cofactor insertion into the relevant redox proteins, and the mechanisms and components regulating the electron flux via the downhill pathway to o <dig> versus the uphill pathway to the nadh complex.

reduced inorganic sulfur oxidation is widespread in prokaryotes  gene pathway  and the archaeal type sulfur oxygenase reductase  gene system . however, neither sox, nor sor have been detected in the genome of a. ferrooxidans  <cit> , raising the question as to how this organism oxidizes riscs.

much of our knowledge of riscs oxidation in a. ferrooxidans comes from enzyme assays performed many years ago on different strains, some of which await phylogenetic characterization or, in some cases, have not yet even been isolated as pure cultures  <cit> . those that have been characterized form genetically diverse clusters with at least three phylogenetic groups  <cit> . this raises the possibility that current models of riscs oxidation reflect a patchwork assemblage of predicted pathways and activities that may not exist in toto in any one a. ferrooxidans strains and perhaps more accurately reflect the pangenomic capacity of the genus acidithiobacillus for riscs oxidation.

thus the current investigation was prompted by the need to generate a more comprehensive picture of iron and sulfur bioenergetics by searching for missing steps and predicting novel enzymatic and electron transfer components and to provide a coherent picture of these processes in one strain of a. ferrooxidans , facilitating the recognition of species variation in bioenergetic pathways.

RESULTS
general features of the transcriptional profiles
rna, isolated from mid-log a. ferrooxidans grown in either sulfur  or ferrous iron ) medium, was used to probe gene expression using microarrays displaying unique oligonucleotides representing about  <dig> predicted genes of the a. ferrooxidans type strain genome. using statistical criteria described previously  <cit> , a  <dig>  log ratio of median cut-off  was selected as indicating differential gene expression in the two growth conditions . the expression patterns observed with the microarrays were validated for some relevant genes by real-time quantitative pcr . one hundred and ninety four genes presented a differential expression profile, of which  <dig> were upregulated  while  <dig> were downregulated  in iron compared to sulfur medium. genes exhibiting differential expression were grouped by hierarchical clustering and were found to be mostly associated with unknown functions, energy metabolism, cell envelope and central intermediary processes .

extending the current model of fe oxidation
the rus operon was induced in fe-grown cells  supporting the current model of the involvement of cyc <dig>  rusticyanin, cyc <dig> and cytochrome oxidase in the oxidation of fe and the downhill electron transfer chain terminating in the reduction of oxygen to water .

embedded in the rus gene operon, is a hypothetical gene of unknown function . its genetic linkage and congruent transcriptional activity suggest that it is involved in fe oxidation . in agreement with these data, highest expression of orf <dig> was detected in iron-compared to sulfur-grown atcc  <dig> cells  <cit> . orf <dig> exhibits weak similarity to the putative type- <dig> multicopper oxidase from halorubrum lacusprofundi  and to the predicted outer membrane type  <dig> multicopper oxidase protein pan <dig> from halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig> . it also exhibits weak similarity to rusticyanin including conservation of three out of its four critical copper binding residues. in addition, epr analysis suggests that orf <dig> contains copper  <cit> . we propose the name cup  for orf <dig>  a possible function for cup is to deliver copper either to aa <dig> cytochrome oxidase or to rusticyanin. the well documented proteins sco and cox <dig> that are involved in copper delivery to copper-containing proteins in other organisms  <cit>  have been not detected in a. ferrooxidans  <cit>  and cup may have assumed their role. given its similarity to rusticyanin, an alternate hypothesis is that cup is involved in electron transfer perhaps between cyc <dig> and cyc <dig> bypassing rusticyanin. two arguments in favor of this hypothesis are: 1) cup has been shown experimentally to be physically associated with cyc <dig> and not with rusticyanin  <cit> , and 2) cup is bound to the outer membrane likely facing the periplasm . cup could provide an alternative route for electron flow during iron oxidation and an additional point for its regulation.

immediately downstream of the rus operon is a cluster of six genes, upregulated in iron , that are predicted to be involved in cytochrome aa <dig> oxidase biogenesis  and iron-responsive regulation of cytochrome aa <dig> oxidase biogenesis : ctaa  encoding an integral membrane protein with  <dig> out of  <dig> his located in transmembrane regions similar to heme a synthase ctaa , ctab  encoding a heme o synthase and ctat  encoding an integral membrane protein belonging to the major facilitator family transporter that could be involved in the exportation of heme a to cytochrome oxidase  <cit>  ; ctar  predicted to encode an iron responsive regulator  <cit>  of the rrf <dig> family that in t. denitrificans is clustered with cbb <dig> cytochrome oxidase biogenesis genes , ctau  encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function and ctas  encoding a predicted fe-dependent oxygenase superfamily member of unknown function. immediately downstream but transcribed in the other direction, are two genes regba , also upregulated in iron , that are predicted to encode a sensor/regulator two-component signal transduction system of the regb/rega family with similarity to regba of rhodobacter capsulatus. rega directly controls synthesis of cytochrome cbb <dig> and ubiquinol oxidases that function as terminal electron acceptors in a branched respiratory chain  <cit> . given the sequence similarity of the predicted a. ferrooxidans rega with that of r. capsulatus, the conservation of the quinone binding site in the membrane spanning domain and of the redox active cysteine in the cytoplasmic transmitter domain of regb, we propose that it is also involved in redox sensing. because of the regba juxtaposition to genes predicted to encode cytochrome aa <dig> oxidase biogenesis, this cytochrome oxidase is a likely candidate for the target of regba regulation in a. ferrooxidans. however, in r. capsulatus, regba also regulates other genes involved in respiratory electron components such as cytochromes c <dig>  c and the cytochrome bc <dig> complex, so that the actual regba target in a. ferrooxidans requires experimental evaluation. regba of r. capsulatus have been shown to respond to the status of the aerobic respiratory chain, most likely the ubiquinone pool in the membrane  <cit>  and, if this also proves to be the case in a. ferrooxidans, regba could help in making regulatory changes to balance electron equivalents between uphill and downhill electron flow, perhaps by adjusting the proportion of cytochrome cyc <dig> and cytochrome oxidase aa <dig>  to the cytochrome cyca <dig> and the cytochrome bc <dig> complex . alternately, regba could play a role in switching between iron and sulfur oxidation or between aerobic and anaerobic oxidation. it is clear that the discovery of the predicted iron and redox responsive regulators ctarus and regab will now allow the experimental biologist to focus on important regulatory switches that are most likely to be involved in cellular decisions related to energy metabolism.

the peti operon was also induced in fe medium  supporting the current model for the role of the bc <dig> complex in the uphill flow of electrons during iron oxidation . embedded within the peti operon is sdra <dig>  whose function remains unknown. sdra <dig> has the characteristic nad binding site at its n-terminus  of ndu <dig> which is a subunit of the nadh complex involved in this complex assembly and stability in a variety of eukaryotes  <cit> . however, sdra <dig> exhibits the conserved catalytic residues  involved in electron input into the nadh complex or electron transfer within the complex, suggesting that this protein could function as an oxidoreductase  <cit>  . sdra <dig> has been predicted to be situated in the cytoplasm in a. ferrooxidans with a possible hydrophobic region embedded in the inner membrane  <cit>  and we hypothesize that it transfers electrons from the quinone pool to the nadh complex .

whereas most of the predicted genes encoding the subunits of the nadh complex  are equally expressed in fe and s <dig> growth conditions, nuoi  and nuok  are upregulated in fe medium . the nuoi encodes a ferredoxin located in the cytoplasmic arm of the nadh complex and is involved in the intramolecular electron transfer between fmn and quinone, whereas nuok encodes a membrane subunit thought to be involved in quinone reduction  <cit>  and in proton translocation  <cit> . given the predicted locations of nuoi and nuok in the hinge region of the nadh complex  <cit>  and the upregulation of nuoi, nuok and sdra <dig> in fe growth conditions, we suggest that they interact to facilitate uphill electron flow from quinone to the nadh complex .

whereas most of the genes predicted to encode the atp synthetase complex were similarly expressed in fe and in s <dig> grown cells, membrane embedded f <dig> subunits a and c, encoded by atpb  and atpe  respectively, were upregulated in fe growth conditions . these subunits are involved in proton translocation across the membrane  <cit>  and their upregulation could allow more protons to pass through the atp synthetase complex during fe oxidation, provided an increase in atp synthesis. however, the resulting increase of intracellular protons requires a concomitant increase in intracellular electrons for their neutralization, so as not to compromise the internal ph of the cell. these electrons could come from the downhill pathway during fe oxidation as shown in figure  <dig> 

the organization and regulation of the components of fe oxidation in a. ferrooxidans appear to be unique to this organism, although thiobacillus prosperus strain v <dig> possesses a transcriptional unit upregulated in iron conditions with some similarity to the rus operon  <cit> . however, the t. prosperus operon lacks the cyc <dig> and the rus genes encoding cytochrome c <dig> and rusticyanin, respectively. the latter is located downstream from the cluster, is monocistonic and is expressed in iron and sulfur growth conditions  <cit> , suggesting different regulatory mechanisms compared to a. ferrooxidans. in leptospirillum group ii, the electron transfer chain involved in fe oxidation contains two cytochromes c and a cbb <dig> cytochrome oxidase  <cit>  but no blue copper protein such as rusticyanin. in the archaea ferroplasma acidarmanus a blue copper protein  has been suggested to transfer the electrons from fe to a cbb3-type terminal oxidase  <cit> . while the genes encoding four blue copper proteins  have been identified in metallosphaera sedula  <cit> , none of them respond to the presence of iron in the medium  <cit> . however, foxa  and soxnl  -cbsab  clusters have been predicted to be important for fe oxidation in m. sedula. genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunits i and ii  and cbsa-like cytochrome b  have been also proposed to be involved in iron oxidation in sulfolobus metallicus  <cit> . it appears therefore that different pathways for ferrous iron oxidation have evolved in prokaryotes.

extending the current model of the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds 
predicted genes, proteins or enzymatic activities previously identified in the oxidation of riscs in different species of a. ferrooxidans include: sqr  encoding sulfide quinone reductase from nasf- <dig> strain  <cit> , doxda  encoding thiosulfate quinone oxidoreductase from atcc <dig>  <cit>  and from the ccm <dig> strain  <cit> , teth  encoding tetrathionate hydrolase from atcc <dig>  <cit> , cydab  encoding a bd oxidase and cyoabcd  encoding a bo <dig> oxidase from atcc <dig>  <cit>  . all these genes are upregulated in sulfur-containing media relatively to fe . this is also the case for the petii operon  encoding a second bc <dig> complex, a cytochrome c <dig>  sdra <dig> and a high potential iron-sulfur protein, hip, as already reported for atcc <dig>  <cit> , atcc <dig>  <cit>  and atcc <dig>  <cit>  strains . this second bc <dig> complex has been proposed to function directly transferring electrons from sulfur to oxygen , and possibly in the aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of sulfur and formate described by pronk et al.  <cit> . in that case, the bc <dig> complex receives the electrons from the quinol pool and transfers them to the membrane-bound cytochrome c <dig> cyca <dig> and/or to the periplasmic high potential iron-sulfur protein hip that subsequently gives the electrons to the terminal oxidase  <cit>  . sdra <dig>  like sdra <dig> , may promote electron flow from the quinone pool to the nadh complex . these findings support earlier models of the branched electron transfer flow during s <dig> oxidation  <cit>  . however, this model is far from being complete and several outstanding questions remain unanswered, including the identification of the enzymes that oxidize sulfur and sulfite.

sulfur
seven genes, potentially encoding a heterodisulfide reductase complex hdrabc  were highly upregulated in cells grown in sulfur medium . this complex catalyzes the reversible reduction of the disulfide bond x-s-s-x coupled with energy conservation in methanogenic archaea  and sulfate reducing archaea and bacteria  <cit> . this complex in a. ferrooxidans is predicted to have three different cytoplasmic hdrb subunits  with the cysteine-rich domain which binds the unusual type  cluster  <cit> , involved in disulfide reduction  <cit> . in addition, genes potentially encoding the ferredoxin-like and the flavoprotein subunits, hdrc  and hdra  are present in the same locus. the flavoprotein hdra subunit exhibits a possible n-terminal membrane spanning region, a conserved fad binding site ), and the conserved four cysteine cluster  that binds a fe-s center, typical of the cytoplasmic iron-sulfur flavoprotein type enzyme.

three genes encoding for sulfur metabolism accessory proteins, placed immediately upstream of the heterodisulfide reductase complex, are similarly upregulated . these encode a cytoplasmic rhodanase-related sulfurtransferase   <cit> , a cytoplasmic sira-like disulfide bond formation regulator  and an inner membrane located peroxiredoxin of the drse superfamily . the rhodanase afe_ <dig> is 48% similar to the sud protein from wolinella succinogenes which binds and transfers polysulfide sulfur to the polysulfide reductase located in the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . in turn, the sira-like protein afe_ <dig> is 54% similar to the tusa protein from vibrio fischeri and other bacteria which belong to a complex sulfur-relay system that facilitates specific sulfur flow/trafficking from various pathways  <cit> . finally, dsre family proteins such as that predicted to be encoded by afe_ <dig> are small proteins recently shown to be involved in sulfur transfer reactions during sulfur oxidation  <cit> .

significant sequence similarity and conserved gene organization of the a. ferrooxidans heterodisulfide reductase complex and accessory proteins is restricted only to aquifex aeolicus and known acidophilic sulfur oxidizing microorganisms hydrogenobaculum sp. y04aas <dig>  hydrogenivirga sp. 128-5-r1- <dig>  metallosphaera sedula  <cit> , sulfolobus acidocaldarius, s. tokodaii and s. solfataricus , associating the whole gene cluster with sulfur oxidation. in methanogenic and sulfate reducing archaea, hdra receives the electrons from the hydrogenase and transfers them through hdrc to the heterodisulfide reductase catalytic site located in hdrb. accompanying the reduction of heterodisulfide, protons are extruded across the membrane creating a proton motive force. we hypothesize that in a. ferrooxidans and the sulfur oxidizers referred above, the hdr complex, driven by the naturally existing proton gradient, could be working in reverse and oxidizing disulfide intermediaries  to sulfite and delivering the collected electrons to the membrane quinol pool . in addition, the three accessory sulfurtransferases are likely involved in the transfer of the proposed sulfane sulfur  <cit>  to the heterodisulfide reductase .

the predicted a. ferrooxidans heterodisulfide reductase complex has additional features that are consistent with its proposed role in riscs oxidation. sulfur oxidation in a variety of different a. ferrooxidans strains has been shown to require glutathione  <cit>  and requires a neutral ph optimum  <cit> , suggesting a cytoplasmic activity in agreement with the predicted localization of the heterodisulfide reductase catalytic site . second, non-heme iron and labile sulfur have been shown to be present in a sulfur oxidizing enzyme preparation of a. ferrooxidans  <cit>  and iron-sulfur clusters are predicted to be present in the a. ferrooxidans hdrb and c subunits. third, sulfur oxidation has been shown to be inhibited by hqno in a. ferrooxidans  <cit> , in agreement with the proposal that the quinone pool is the physiological electron acceptor . fourth, the actual substrate of the sulfur oxidizing enzyme in a. ferrooxidans is thought not to be elemental sulfur, which has poor water solubility and cannot enter the cell, but rather sulfane sulfur of gsnh species  and most likely gssh  <cit> . sulfane sulfate would thus provide the necessary disulfide bond x-s-s-x to serve as a substrate for the predicted catalytic activity of the a. ferrooxidans heterodisulfide reductase . conserved within the heterodisufide reductase gene cluster, between hdra and hdrc <dig>  is a putative gene of unknown function  whose product is predicted to reside in the cytoplasm . given its conserved gene context, we propose that it is also involved in riscs oxidation and it is now pinpointed for experimental investigation.

sulfite
another step in the sulfur oxidation model that awaits genetic characterization is sulfite oxidation. being metastable and considered short-lived in mine waste environments, one possibility is that sulfite rapidly oxidizes non-enzymically to sulfate, thiosulfate or glutathione s-sulfonate in the presence of fe  <cit>  or sulfur  <cit> . however, the involvement of a protein catalyzing this reaction is more likely since a sulfite oxidase activity was purified from three different strains of a. ferrooxidans, namely tm  <cit> , atcc <dig>  <cit>  and ap19- <dig>  <cit> 

genes coding for known periplasmic enzymes involved in the direct oxidation of sulfite during sulfur dissimilatory metabolism  have not been detected in the a. ferrooxidans genome. in our model , sulfite is hypothesized to be produced in the cytoplasm by heterodisulfide reductase. therefore, subsequent oxidation of sulfite is likely to occur in this cellular location and therefore would not be expected to proceed via the classical periplasmic sor or sox. one possibility for the cytoplasmic activity is that sulfite is converted to adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate  via the well characterized aps reductase complex encoded by aprba  <cit> . however, the genome contains no candidates with significant similarity to aprba, although it does have a predicted sat  which, in other microorganisms, encodes an atp sulfurylase responsible for the second step in this pathway. the a. ferrooxidans sat shares 44% identity and 60% similarity with both domains of the bifunctional sat/aps kinase from aquifex aeolicus that catalyzes the production of atp and sulfate from aps and pyrophosphate  <cit> . if sat is indeed catalyzing aps to sulfate , an enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of sulfite to aps is required. this missing function could be accomplished by the conserved hypothetical gene embedded in the hdr locus of sulfur oxidizers . the concordance of gene occurrence and organization between a. aeolicus, hydrogenobaculum sp. y04aas <dig> the sulfolobales and a. ferrooxidans including 1) the hdr locus with a gene of unknown function 2) sat and 3) a lack of aprba, strongly suggests that these microorganisms have a novel sulfur oxidation pathway.

our data agree with the model proposed for s <dig> oxidation in m. sedula, including a heterodisulfide reductase , a tetrathionate hydrolase , a terminal oxidase complex based on both quinol oxidase  and aa3-type cytochrome oxidase  components  <cit> . in s. metallicus, a gene , encoding sulfur oxygenase reductase, which is absent in a. ferrooxidans, is the dominant transcript in sulfur-grown cells and is therefore proposed to be involved in sulfur oxidation  <cit> . in conclusion, the riscs oxidation pathways of acidophiles are not only different from those of neutrophilic sulfur oxidizers  <cit>  but also appear to be different among the acidophilic sulfur-oxidizers including between members of the acidithiobacillus genus  <cit> . in that sense, the conservation of the hdr locus in different acidophilic sulfur oxidizers, archaea and eubacteria, is noteworthy and merits further investigation.

additional discussion
genomic and transcriptomic  studies of iron and sulfur energetic metabolism of a. ferrooxidans, not only confirm previous data, but elaborate on the complexity of these pathways. both iron and riscs respiratory chains are branched and redundant  <cit>  . this provides a. ferrooxidans with a flexible respiratory system that may allow it to adapt efficiently to environmental changes by modulating gene expression according to the growth conditions . another way to adapt efficiently to a change in the growth conditions is by modifying the association of complexes as suggested recently for iron respiration in a. ferrooxidans  <cit> . in the case of the cytochrome c oxidase complex of dictyostelium discoideum, the oxygen concentration induces a switch between two interchangeable subunit isoforms of the cytochrome c oxidase  <cit> . this switch has been shown to be due to transcriptional regulation and also to different stabilities of the two subunits toward oxygen  <cit> .

both iron and riscs oxidation pathways involve outer membrane, periplasmic and inner membrane components . according to our hypothesis, several super-complexes spanning the outer and/or the inner membranes are expected to conduct either the electrons to the oxygen, or the sulfane-sulfur to the catalytic side of the herodisulfide reductase, from pyrite , which is a natural substrate of a. ferrooxidans. while such a super-complex has been isolated recently for iron oxidation  <cit> , no biochemical data are available until now to substantiate the existence of a sulfane-sulfur transfer supramolecular structure. while a sulfurtransferase complex encoded by the hdr locus is likely to be involved in the transfer of the proposed sulfane sulfur to the heterodisulfide reductase from the inner membrane to the cytoplasm , expression data suggests no obvious upregulated outer membrane protein as proposed by rohwerder and sand  <cit>  to allow it to cross the cell wall. we propose also the existence of a cytoplasmic super-complex catalyzing both the oxidation of sulfane-sulfur to sulfite and of sulfite to aps, preventing the accumulation of sulfite in the cytoplasm . while the existence of such a complex has not been demonstrated in a. ferrooxidans, a thiosulfate-oxidizing system oxidizing hydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, sulfur and sulfite directly to sulfate without the presence of free intermediates has been evidenced in paracoccus versutus and paracoccus pantotrophus . moreover, the methanogenic and sulfate reducing archaea heterodisulfide reductase forms a tight complex with the hydrogenase, which catalyzes its reduction with h <dig> . such supramolecular structures will allow  stabilization of the different components  electron, or sulfane sulfur, channeling leading to more efficient transfer, and  diffusion avoidance preventing toxic compound leakage.
