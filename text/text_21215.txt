BACKGROUND
perciform fishes of the suborder notothenioidei comprise a major portion of the southern ocean fauna  <cit> . they began to radiate into antarctic waters in the early tertiary, gradually adapting to the progressive cooling, which set in after the opening of the drake passage and the formation of the circumpolar current some 14– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . isolation of the antarctic continental shelf by the polar front has produced arguably the coldest, most oceanographically stable environment on the planet. however, in direct opposition to this highly stenothermic environment are the profound environmental extremes produced by the transition from 24 hours of sunlight to complete darkness over the winter months, resulting in significant variation in primary productivity. as a result, antarctic marine organisms inhabiting these ice-laden waters have faced unique metabolic and physiological challenges for survival and persistence. the impacts of low temperatures and seasonally limited food availability have long been recognized as primary selective forces driving the evolution of the many endemic species found in antarctica today  <cit> . in addition to the high degree of endemism produced by these evolutionary processes, a wide-array of functional adaptations have been fixed among protein families of several antarctic fish, including chaperonins  <cit> , heat shock proteins  <cit> , heme proteins  <cit> , tubulin kinetics  <cit> , and anti-freeze proteins  <cit> . this rigid oceanographic stability however, may have resulted in an ecosystem filled with endemic fauna that are poorly poised to deal with rapid climate variation  <cit> . for instance, cold specialization has resulted in increased mitochondrial densities at uncompensated capacities in some notothenioids  <cit> . these increased densities have also been combined with reductions in hematocrit and cardiovascular output  <cit> .

although a significant amount of sequencing work has been done to elucidate the evolutionary history and phylogenetic relationships among these unique fishes, much of the available sequence information is constrained to a few highly conserved genes such as ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, or highly specified genes such as the antifreeze glycoprotein genes. recent advances in dna sequencing technology have lead to a significant increase in the availability of molecular tools to ecologists and physiologists. a particular research niche that is poised to benefit greatly from this rapid increase in sequence data is the field of polar biology. the availability of well-annotated transcriptomes from a variety of polar species will provide the groundwork for future functional genomics studies aimed at elucidating the impact of global climate change on polar ecosystems. with the application of next generation sequencing tools in an ecological setting, we can begin to investigate organismal responses at a level of complexity that was not approachable in years past. to date, only two large-scale sequencing studies of transcribed genes have been published for any antarctic notothen, including an est library for dissostichus mawsoni in the subfamily pleuragramminae  <cit>  and a comparative study of the transcriptomes from a member of the nototheniinae and pleuragramminae sub-families  <cit> . to date, relatively little sequence information is available for any member of the trematominae subfamily despite the ecological importance of these fish in coastal antarctic environments. due to its circumpolar distribution, abundance and relative ease of collection, trematomus bernacchii has long been a target species for physiological and biochemical studies assessing the plasticity of this highly stenothermic family of fishes and the cost of adaptation to such a cold stable environment  <cit> . while earlier attempts at using heterologous hybridizations to a cdna array of a temperate goby provided insight into the transcriptional response of highly conserved genes in this species  <cit> , we still lack a robust approach to functional genomics in these unique fish. here we describe the de novo assembly and annotation of the transcriptome of the emerald notothen, t. bernacchii. in addition, we provide a glimpse into the tissue specific response to thermal stress at the level of the transcript that highlights the sensitivity and utility of these applications in polar fish.

RESULTS
sequence data and de novo assembly
roche  <dig> sequencing generated a total of  <dig>  unpaired reads across six samples with an average length of  <dig>  bp. the raw data were deposited at the ncbi sequence read archive under the study accession number . after sequence trimming for adapter removal and screening of sequences based on quality and ambiguity scores,  <dig>  reads remained with an average length of  <dig>  bp. de novo assembly of these reads using the clc genomics de novo assembly tool matched  <dig>  reads, leaving  <dig>  unmatched singletons. the final transcriptome contained  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 605 bp .

overall, the resulting number of unigenes produced in our assembly is in line with results reported in previous studies utilizing roche  <dig> data for de novo full transcriptome assemblies of other fish species, including  <dig> , <dig> reads yielding  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 888 bp in common carp   <cit> ; and  <dig> , <dig> reads yielding  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> in asian seabass   <cit> . furthermore, our average coverage  is comparable to  <dig> de novo transcriptome assemblies conducted with similar number of sequencing reads  <cit> ; and possesses a similar percentage of reads mapping back to the unigenes  as well  <cit> .

to further validate our transcriptome, we compared the alignment and similarity of our unigenes to the  <dig> known full and partial t. bernacchii sequences available on ncbi at the time of our study using blastx. this comparison yielded  <dig> matches with an e-value < 10- <dig>  of which  <dig> sequences possessed a percent identity > 95% . despite the limited sequence data available for t. bernacchii, these alignment metrics indicate a relatively accurate transcriptome assembly.

of the 303 t. bernacchii sequences available, only four failed to align to a unigene sequence. two of these sequences form interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein , a protein that accumulates in the subretinal space and facilitates exchanges during the “visual cycle”  <cit> . due to the high degree of specificity to the visual process, it is unlikely that this product would be found in the liver, gill or brain tissues that were sequenced in this effort. another unmatched query represented a partial of e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase 2; however, six different unigenes  matched e <dig> ubiquitin ligase-like proteins during annotation. it is likely that this partial query sequence did not overlap with the available assembled sequence of the unigenes, which themselves are not complete representations of the entire coding region of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases. the last query that failed to align was that of a putative voltage-activated sodium channel alpha subunit , which are functionally conserved and have lengths ranging between 3300-3500 bp in teleost fish  <cit> . as the partial sequence available for t. bernacchii scna is only 276 bp, it is very likely our sequencing efforts simply failed to provide areas of overlap with the partial cdna sufficient to align it to a unigene.

in a effort to further validate our transcriptome assembly, we compared our assembly to the transcriptomes of nine other prior sequenced teleost fish including: notothenia coriiceps, chaenocephalus aceratus, pleuragramma antarcticum, gasterosteus aculeatus, takifugu rubripes, oryzias latipes, tetraodon nigroviridis, oreochromis niloticus and danio rerio . blast searches were conducted using our assembled unigenes as query sequences against the available transcriptome of each fish using either blastx or blastn, depending on the form of the sequence database available. the blastn results demonstrated a high degree of similarity between the transcriptome generated for t. bernacchii and that of n. corriceps, a related notothenioid species , as well as strong similarity to the two other more distantly related antarctic fish, p. antarticum  and c. aceratus . blastx searches against the non-polar fish in our analysis yielded results similar to previous comparisons between the transcriptomes of notothenioid fishes and those of non-polar fish species   <cit> .

blastx searches were conducted for gasterosteus aculeatus, takifugu rubripes, oryzias latipes, tetraodon nigroviridis, oreochromis niloticus, and danio rerio; blastn searches were conducted for: notothenia coriiceps, chaenocephalus aceratus, and pleuragramma antarcticum, due to a lack of available protein databases.

annotation, classification, and analysis
blastx results using the unigene sequences as queries against the non-redundant protein sequences  database at ncbi yielded  <dig>  significant alignments , and when combined with an additional  <dig>  blastn results from our searches against the nucleotide collection  database, yielded a total of  <dig>  unigene sequences with a significant blast result. of these results,  <dig>  unigene sequences mapped to go terms using the blast2go  software package. ultimately, interproscan results merged with b2go annotations yielded a total of  <dig>  fully annotated unigene sequences. the final distribution of annotated unigenes included  <dig>  unigenes sequences with a significant blast result only,  <dig>  unigene sequences mapped in b2go, and  <dig>  unigene sequences fully annotated with go terms . overall, approximately 43% of our unigenes had a significant hit in the nr protein or nucleotide database and we were able to assign go annotation to  <dig> % of unigenes in the dataset, which was highly comparable to recent assembly and annotation efforts for other non-model fish species  <cit> .

tissue specific gene expression
the transcriptome wide gene ontology in wego format yielded  <dig>   go annotation results for cellular component,  <dig>   go annotation results for biological process, and  <dig>   go annotation results for molecular function in t. bernacchii . for the most part, expression levels associated with individual go classifications were found to be very similar across the entire transcriptome and individual tissues . however, some gene expression trends can be detected that are likely associated with differences in functional roles of the tissues. for example, when comparing the biological processes between tissues, the role of the liver in protein metabolism is evident with  <dig> % of its total biological processes dedicated to metabolic processes as compared to  <dig> % in the gill and  <dig> % in the brain. also, the gill tissue demonstrated elevated representation for the go classification ‘response to stimuli’, perhaps due to their more immediate exposure to the external environment, with approximately  <dig> % of biological processes dedicated to this function as opposed to  <dig> % in the brain.

the molecular function of expressed transcripts also displayed variation that mirror physiological differences between the tissues. for instance, despite being a primary site for cellular detoxification, liver did not exhibit sufficient antioxidant activity to meet the applied threshold  for this go term, whereas the go term antioxidant activity was highly represented in the gill, perhaps due to this tissue’s direct contact with the extremely cold, highly oxygenated water of the southern ocean . these results parallel previous expression patterns of antioxidant proteins in the gill and liver tissue of t. bernacchii; enzor and place  <cit>  report protein concentrations of two isoforms of the antioxidant enzyme family superoxide dismutase  are relatively higher in gill tissue compared to liver tissue and total sod activity is also elevated in gill tissue. as for cellular components, each tissue largely mirrored one another and the transcriptome as a whole . enzyme code distributions for each tissue calculated by the main enzyme classes: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lysases, isomerases, demonstrated a similar pattern of enzyme activity across tissues. the distribution being: liver , gill  and brain  respectively . notably, the liver displayed the greatest variety of enzymes, commiserate with its involvement in protein and lipid metabolism.

a comparison of the unigenes against the kegg database, a resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of biological systems  <cit> , yielded  <dig>  sequences with a significant match  to  <dig> kegg pathways and  <dig> enzymes. of the  <dig> pathways there were  <dig> pathways with over  <dig> sequences assigned. the pathway for purine metabolism was the most commonly assigned , followed by oxidative phosphorylation , nitrogen metabolism , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , pyrimidine metabolism , glutathione metabolism , methane metabolism , drug metabolism- other enzymes , t-cell receptor signaling pathway , and pentose phosphate pathway , with the remaining  <dig> pathways listed in the supplemental information . when analyzing dominant kegg pathways assigned to the unigenes expressed in each tissue, the most commonly assigned kegg pathways generally followed the most commonly assigned pathways for t. bernacchii as a whole, with a few exceptions . overall, liver tissue matched  <dig>  unique sequences to  <dig> kegg pathways and  <dig> enzymes; gill tissue matched  <dig>  unique sequences to  <dig> kegg pathways and  <dig> enzymes; brain tissue matched  <dig>  unique sequences to  <dig> keg pathways and  <dig> enzymes .

digital gene expression analysis
the cellular response to temperature stress in fish is highly conserved, and the unique evolutionary history and resulting physiological response to elevated temperature previously reported in t. bernacchii provides a useful backdrop to discuss the findings from our study. it should be noted, that this study was not designed to explicitly test the effects of temperature on gene expression, since rna from individuals within a thermal acclimation treatment was pooled prior to library construction. however, an initial qualitative comparison can be performed, and the results compared to previous studies that have performed more quantitative gene expression analyses. to simplify the expression analysis for comparison of tissue specific changes in gene expression across treatments, we limited our consideration to only those unigenes annotated with either a blast result, functional mapping, or full go annotation. we then characterized the relative changes in tissue specific expression patterns in − <dig> °c  and +4°c acclimated fish. after screening to remove data pairs that did not exhibit expression in either treatment, we achieved our final expression datasets for each tissue. in all, the expression levels of  <dig>  unigene pairs were compared in the liver in which we found  <dig>  unigenes were down-regulated 2-fold or greater while  <dig>  were found to be up-regulated 2-fold or greater . for gill tissue, comparison of the expression levels of  <dig>  unigene pairs showed  <dig>  unigenes were down-regulated and  <dig>  unigenes were up-regulated at least 2-fold or greater . for expression analysis of the brain tissue we compared the expression levels of  <dig>  unigene pairs, of which  <dig>  were down-regulated and  <dig>  were up-regulated at least 2-fold .

below we discuss the general gene expression trends that emerged from our preliminary rnaseq analyses with respect to the most highly expressed gene families under ambient conditions. in addition, in order to more fully interpret the effects of long-term acclimation to elevated temperatures on t. bernacchii, we extended our analysis beyond that of the most highly represented gene families, and in doing so, focused on three particular areas that encompass the cellular response to elevated temperature observed in t. bernacchii.

tissue specific gene expression profiles under ambient conditions
prior studies characterizing the gene expression profiles of nothothenioid fishes held under ambient conditions found tissue specific transcriptomes that were dominated by a few highly expressed transcripts  <cit> . we found a similar pattern among our tissues sampled from t. bernacchii, albeit to a lesser degree with the  <dig> most highly expressed annotated unigenes in the liver, gill and brain tissues representing ~ <dig> %, ~ <dig> % and ~ <dig> % of total transcripts respectively . similar to results reported for the liver transcriptome of d. mawsoni, we found apolipoproteins and fibrogen chains were among the most highly expressed genes in the liver of t. bernacchii under ambient conditions   <cit> . this over-representation appears to be further exaggerated by long-term acclimation to elevated temperatures. analysis of the liver transcriptome of fish acclimated to +4°c for 28 days showed apolipoproteins were considerably up-regulated with the  <dig> kda apoliprotein undergoing a  <dig> -fold increase to represent  <dig> % of all transcripts and apolipoprotein a-i undergoing a  <dig> -fold increase to represent  <dig> % of all transcripts . given their role in lipid mobilization and transport, it seems plausible this significant increase in apolopiproteins is playing an important role in offsetting the rapid increase in metabolic demands previously associated with the acclimatory response of t. bernacchii to elevated temperature  <cit> .

in addition, we found similar patterns of gene expression in the brain tissue of t. bernacchii as those found in d. mawsoni. chen and colleagues report a number of transcripts that are involved in the protection, maintenance and repair of neural tissue, including s100β and ependymin- <dig>  which are highly represented in the transcriptome of d. mawsoni brain tissue  <cit> . under ambient temperature conditions, s100β and ependymin- <dig> comprise  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively of the expressed genes in t. bernacchii brain tissue, and when exposed to a thermal stress, the expression of these two transcripts increased significantly. in fish acclimated to +4°c, s100β increase over 13-fold, representing  <dig> % of all expressed transcripts and ependymin- <dig> increased by greater than 7-fold to represent ~2% of all expressed transcripts in the brain . although only semi-quantitative at this point, these data suggest t. bernacchii maintain a strong capacity to respond to environmental conditions perturbing to neural function.

the gill tissue displayed a somewhat different trend with respect to the highly expressed transcripts found in the ambient and +4°c acclimated fish. in the gill tissue from fish acclimated to +4°c, we saw an overall down-regulation of many of the most highly expressed transcripts found in ambient fish including, 60s ribosomal proteins , zinc finger proteins , mapks  and translation initiation factor eif2b  . interestingly, many of these genes were reported to show a moderate up-regulation  after an acute heat shock event  in a previous study employing a transcriptome wide analysis of t. bernacchii <cit> . the differences in gene expression profiles between these two studies likely capture the transition that occurs between immediate response to stress and the long-term physiological adjustments that follow. the general down-regulation of gene families involved in transcription and translation in our long-term treatment may indicate a diminished capacity for protein turnover at elevated temperatures. however, despite a general down-regulation of one of the cells major energy consuming pathways in the gill tissue, we see a  <dig> -fold up-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase i and a  <dig> -fold up-regulation of cytochrome b  which mirrors the increased capacity for aerobic metabolism found under conditions of acute thermal stress in t. bernacchii <cit> . these findings, along with the strong up-regulation of apolipoproteins in the liver, suggest that mobilization of energy stores and atp production continue to play a central role in the capacity of t. bernacchii to mitigate the effects of elevated temperatures long-after cellular restructuring has likely occurred.

protein homeostasis and the heat shock response 
heat shock proteins  have long been known to play a significant role in folding of nascent polypeptides as well as the rescue and refolding of proteins under conditions of cellular stress  <cit> . despite the functional roles for these protein families being highly conserved across all taxa, antarctic notothenioids display divergent expression patterns that might be related to environmental constraints. previous studies have observed that inducible hsp isoforms and protein-specific chaperones are continuously up-regulated in several notothenioid species, potentially indicating a persistent system-wide requirement for mitigating the denaturing effect of the constant cold of the southern ocean  <cit> . as a result of this persistent elevation of the heat shock response , it is believed that the extremely cold adapted notothenioids, including t. bernacchii, are no longer capable of further up-regulating inducible isoforms of hsps when exposed to thermal stress  <cit> . to see if similar trends were identified in our long-term acclimations of t. bernacchii, we compared the level of expression for several molecular chaperones involved in the hsr. two particular hsps previously found to be up-regulated in fish exposed to chronic high temperature are hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  <cit> . consistent with previous findings for acute thermal stresses, we found that hsp <dig> expression was generally insensitive to long-term acclimation at elevated temperature with only moderate changes detected . similarly, the inducible isoform of hsp <dig>  also showed only small variations in expression in all three tissues  . also seen with the hsp <dig> molecular chaperone, gill tissue appeared to be the most responsive, which may be attributable to the direct contact of these cells to the water and thus environmental variations. overall, our findings for the expression patterns of hsps in t. bernacchii reflect previous findings and further substantiate the belief that much of its ability to mount a hsr has been lost  <cit> . intriguingly, although no significant changes were seen in the inducible hsp isoforms, we did observe a significant decrease in expression levels of the constitutive isoform, hsc <dig>  in liver and gill . this down-regulation of hsc <dig> was also accompanied by moderate decreases in the constitutively expressed hsp90β .

in addition to the major molecular chaperone families represented in the transcriptome, we also identified a number of unigenes with homology to several members of the α-crystallin-type super family, collectively referred to as small heat shock proteins . although shsps are known have similar cytoprotective effects as those found with larger size class molecular chaperones, they are often found expressed in lower abundances and in some instances their function may be non-essential for cell survival  <cit> . in our study, we found the shpss showed tissue specific responses with shsps in the liver displaying the greatest magnitude change. after acclimation to +4°c, transcript levels for hsp27/b <dig>  hsp30/b <dig> and α-crystallin all showed a 2-fold or greater up-regulation in liver tissue. however, in gill and brain tissue expression of these shsps were either not detected or down-regulated, except in the case of α-crystallin in the brain tissue which displayed a 3-fold increase .

as this is only a preliminary characterization of the transcriptome of t. bernacchii under chronic thermal stress, we are unable to elucidate the importance of the trends identified with respect to the expression of hsps. however, in combination with the expression patterns of the transcriptional machinery mentioned above, we speculate this could be related to an overall decrease in transcription with long-term acclimation to elevated temperatures, potentially as a means to conserve energy. we have previously shown metabolic rates in t. bernacchii are initially elevated when acclimated to +4°c but gradually return to baseline levels  <cit> . a general reduction in transcription rates could represent physiological trade-offs associated with long-term physiological adjustments necessary to reduce the cellular demand for oxygen. alternatively, these reductions in capacity for protein synthesis and chaperoning may represent hallmarks of temperature compensation at the cellular level in these fish. these results represent potentially novel insight into the thermal acclimation of these fish and highlight the sensitivity and utility of these approaches for understanding physiological responses in this system.

cellular stress response 
the cellular stress response  is a conserved defense reaction activated at the cellular level when exterior forces cause strain on an organism  <cit> . the heat shock proteins that serve as molecular chaperones and the hsr described above are probably the most well-known constituents of the csr, but there are a number of additional cellular pathways involved in the cell’s response to stress that are likely co-regulated, including: redox regulation proteins, dna damage sensing/repair proteins, protein degradation proteins, fatty acid/lipid metabolism proteins and energy metabolism proteins . notothenioid fishes are known to significantly elevate their resting metabolic rates at these temperatures, which could in turn lead to a significant increase in the potential for oxidative damage to macro molecules  <cit> . thus, in organisms adapted to extreme environments such as the notothenioids where the hsr has largely been lost, these additional csr mechanisms could play a more significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

the alteration of cellular redox potential due to stress is a major trigger of the csr and the expression of certain reductases, redoxins and dehydrogenases signify a robust csr to changing conditions  <cit> . we analyzed these redox regulators using our dataset to provide preliminary insight into the broader csr of t. bernacchii. each tissue demonstrated a general trend of up-regulation of redox regulators with all but three of the annotated redox regulators being up-regulated in at least two tissues , and  <dig> of  <dig> up-regulated in all three tissues  . the brain tissue displayed the greatest magnitude of response for redox regulators, with  <dig> of  <dig> redox regulators up-regulated 2-fold or greater compared to the liver in which only  <dig> were found up-regulated and only  <dig> redox regulator up-regulated 2-fold or more . while t. bernacchii does appear to up-regulate redox regulators as part of its csr, much like the hsps, the ability to increase the expression of redox regulators may be moderated to some extent and is highly tissue specific.

high mobility group b <dig> protein and its role as a global temperature sensor
previous studies have indicated that the high mobility group b <dig>  protein, which has a key function in the assembly of transcription initiation and enhanceosome complexes, may serve as a gene expression temperature sensor in fish  <cit> . when subjecting the killifish  to heat shock conditions, the killifish responded by reducing its expression of hmgb <dig>  <cit> . the expression levels of hmgb <dig> in t. bernacchii support the idea that hmgb <dig> is highly responsive to temperature and may serve as a gene expression temperature sensor in fish. however, hmgb <dig> expression patterns in t. bernacchii dramatically differ with those reported for a. limneaus. we found hmgb <dig> undergoes substantial up-regulation when exposed to chronic thermal stress, not down-regulation as seen in the killifish. in all three tissues characterized in this study, hmgb <dig> showed a 2-fold or greater increase in expressed transcripts when acclimated to elevated temperatures. if we consider the functional role of hmgb <dig> we might be able to draft some potential insight into these contradictory results.

hmgb <dig> has two functional roles, an intra-nuclear function where it positively regulates transcription by affecting chromatin structure  <cit> , and an intracellular role  where it can stimulate the inflammatory process by stimulating cytokines from endothelial cells, monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . t. bernacchii may be increasing intracellular levels of hmgb <dig> during exposure to elevated temperatures to increase transcription rates, restructure membrane components and increase aerobic capacity in an effort to meet an elevated demand for oxygen associated with acclimation to these temperatures  <cit> . alternatively, it is possible that the increased expression of hmgb <dig> is a result of inflammation due to cellular damage sustained from the +4°c acclimation temperature. while it is unclear if the differences in hmgb <dig> regulation in t. bernacchii and a. limneaus are representative of the adaptive differences between the species, or potentially related to the difference in acclimation times used within the two studies, these data further supports the case for hmgb <dig> as an important regulator of thermal stress response in fish.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this is the first large-scale effort aimed at sequencing and assembling the transcriptome of a species from the ecologically important subfamily trematominae. with this dataset, we now have an annotated transcriptome from at least one member of all three major subfamilies in notheniidae. our sequencing, assembly, and annotation efforts yielded an annotated transcriptome library for t. bernacchii containing  <dig>  unigenes of which  <dig>  possess strong homology to known proteins. the subsequent application of this library to characterize tissue specific changes in relative abundance using raw sequencing reads allowed us to observe the transcriptomic composition of a polar organism in much greater detail than previously available. our preliminary rnaseq analysis of a portion of the csr demonstrates the potential of digital gene expression analysis to greatly increase our understanding of notothenioids, and polar organisms in general, on a genomic level.

continued efforts to refine these resources for t. bernacchii may well serve to establish these unique fish as a ‘model’ organism for research in polar adapted species and as an important part of a greater effort to increase the genomic resources for polar organisms that inhabit the extreme, yet static polar environments like the southern ocean. as global climate change accelerates, and its effects are experienced most rapidly and dramatically at high latitudes  <cit> , continued generation of these resources will prove vital to our understanding of the adaptive potential of endemic polar organisms.
