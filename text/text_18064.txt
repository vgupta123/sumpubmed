BACKGROUND
drought is one of the most common environmental abiotic stresses in the world. to adapt to environmental changes, plants have a variety of physiological responses and defence systems for withstanding drought conditions. the regulatory mechanism in higher plants has been analysed by studying a number of genes responding to drought stress at the transcriptional level  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, for example, thousands of genes are thought to be involved in abiotic stress  <cit> . in general, drought stress-inducible genes have been classified into two groups: one group that directly protects plants against environmental stresses, and a second group that regulates gene expression networks and signalling in stress responses, such as in response to drought or salt stress  <cit> . recently, progress has been made in analysing the functions of stress-inducible genes, not only to understand the mechanisms of drought stress but also to improve the drought tolerance of plants by gene transfer. genetic studies have identified many transcription factors that are extensively involved in the regulatory network of drought-inducible genes  <cit> , including, for example, the nac  <cit> , wrky  <cit> , and myb families  <cit> .

as a xerophytic desert tree, haloxylon ammodendron has great drought and salt resistance; thus, it plays an important role in the maintenance of the structure and function of the entire ecosystem in which it grows. h. ammodendron reduces wind speed and ameliorates the forest microclimate, thereby facilitating the settlement and growth of other desert plants  <cit> . h. ammodendron is widely distributed in a variety of habitats, including gravel desert, clay desert, fixed and semi-fixed sand, and saline land in the asian and african deserts  <cit> . in china, about 56% of h. ammodendron is found in xinjiang province, 40% in inner mongolia province, and the remaining 4% in qinghai and gansu provinces  <cit> . at present, most research examining the drought tolerance of h. ammodendron focuses on physiology  and on the identification of specific genes. some important drought-related genes have been cloned using rt-pcr and the race method, including the cmo
 <cit> , arf1
 <cit>  and ef-hand cabp
 <cit>  genes. however, to our knowledge, no study involving large-scale drought-related gene screening and est-ssr identification has been published to date.

genome-wide analyses have dramatically improved the efficiency of gene discovery. with the advent of next-generation sequencing, large-scale transcriptome data has become available in both model and non-model species. since hegedus et al.  <cit>  first used solexa/illumina’s digtal gene expression  system to study the zebrafish transcriptome after mycobacterium marinum infection, rna-seq and dge technology have been widely used to identify plant genes, including those expressed in stress condition  <cit> , related to important agronomic traits. for example, in a. thaliana, about 30% of the transcriptome was found to be regulated by abiotic stress, and  <dig>  genes were identified as being of great importance in cold, salt, and drought tolerance  <cit> . in chinese cabbage, yu et al.  conducted transcriptome profiling by tag sequencing and by quantifying the expression of more than  <dig>  genes in response to dehydration stress; these authors found that  <dig> genes in  <dig> transcription factors were involved in signal transduction and that the expression of  <dig> water- and osmosensing-responsive genes was significantly altered in response to water deficit  <cit> .

molecular markers play important roles in many activities involved in plant breeding, such as studies of genetic diversity  <cit> , marker-assisted selections  <cit> , and the identification of genes responsible for desirable traits  <cit> . molecular markers have been widely used to map important genes and to assist with the breeding of trees. many est-ssr markers were developed using collected ests or high-throughput sequencing data. for example, in the rubber tree, li et al.  <cit>  used hiseq <dig> sequencing to sequence rna from the bark of healthy rubber trees and got more than  <dig> million sequencing reads; after these sequences were assembled,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained. a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs were then identified from these  <dig>  unigenes. finally, the pcr success ratio for the  <dig> randomly selected primers used in this study was  <dig> %  <cit> . in the date palm, zhao et al.  identified  <dig>  est-ssrs from  <dig>  est sequences, and after examining their random primers, these authors found that one third of their primers had polymorphisms in  <dig> different date palm cultivars  <cit> .

in this study, the transcriptome from different tissues of drought-treated and control h. ammodendron plants were sequenced with illumina paired-end sequencing technology. the resulting sequence data were assembled and annotated, dge profiling was performed, and est-ssr markers were developed. to our knowledge, this is the first systematic report on the transcriptome of h. ammodendron. this research is essential to understand the transcriptional changes underlying the drought response in h. ammodendron. the transcriptome data generated from our study provide a resource for gene annotation and discovery, the development of molecular markers, genomic and transcriptomic assembly, and the development of microarrays for h. ammodendron. in addition, the est-ssr markers predicted and developed in this study enlarge the number of available molecular markers and may facilitate gene mapping, linkage map development, genetic diversity analysis, and marker-assisted selection breeding in h. ammodendron.

RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing and de novoassembly
to investigate the transcriptome of h. ammodendron under drought conditions, rna was extracted from different tissues and sequenced using illumina paired-end sequencing technology. in this study, a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw sequencing reads with a length of  <dig> bp each were generated from a  <dig> bp insert library. after removing adaptors and low quality data,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained. the high-quality reads were then used to assemble the transcriptome data using trinity software. using overlapping information in high-quality reads, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were generated, with an average length of  <dig>  bp and an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp. after compared the different transcripts representing one unigene, the longest length transcript for each unigene was extracted. so then a total of  <dig>  unigenes were obtained. the average length was 728bp, and transcripts with lengths of more than  <dig> bp accounted for about  <dig> % of all transcripts .table  <dig>

annotation of all non-redundant unigenes
for the validation and annotation of the assembled unigenes, all assembled unigenes were screened against the ncbi non-redundant  and swiss-prot protein databases using the blast  <dig> .28+ program with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  among  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   were found to have significant similarity to  <dig>  unique proteins. of all the unigenes,  <dig>   with significant identities to swiss-prot proteins were matched with  <dig>  unique protein accessions . it was found that a smaller percentage was obtained when searching against the swiss-prot protein database rather than against the nr database. in total, blast searches identified  <dig>  unique protein accessions from the nr and swiss-prot protein databases, suggesting that our illumina paired-end sequencing had likely captured a substantial proportion of the drought-response genes in h. ammodendron.table  <dig>

functional classification by go and cog
in order to classify the functions of the predicted h. ammodendron unigenes, gene ontology , which is an internationally standardised gene functional classification system, was used. in total,  <dig>  unigenes with blast matches to known proteins were assigned to go classes using  <dig>  functional terms . as shown in figure 1a, the majority of the unigenes were assigned to the categories of biological processes , followed by cellular components  and molecular functions . under the category of biological processes, cellular processes  and metabolic processes  were prominently represented, indicating that important cellular processes and metabolic activities occurred in h. ammodendron in response to drought. under the classification of molecular functions, binding  and catalytic activities  were separately the first and second largest categories, respectively, whereas other categories, such as those for transporter activities, enzyme regulator activities, molecular transducer activities, and others, together contained only  <dig>  unigenes representing  <dig> % of the total number of unigenes. as for the cellular component, two categories, pertaining to cells and cell parts, accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the cellular components that were identified; the organelle category accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the cellular component unigenes, and the membrane and membrane part categories accounted for  <dig> %.

in order to predict and classify possible functions, all unigenes were aligned to the cluster of orthologous groups  database in which orthologous gene products were classified. out of  <dig>  unigenes with significant similarity to nr proteins in this study,  <dig>  sequences were assigned to cog classifications . among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster related to general function prediction  was the largest group, followed by those for posttranslational modification ; translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis ; and signal transduction mechanisms .figure  <dig>

functional classifications using kegg pathways
the kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes  pathway database is a knowledge base for the systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of networks of genes and molecules in cells and their variants specific to particular organisms. to further analyse the transcriptome of h. ammodendron, all the unigenes were analysed with respect to the kegg pathway database. out of the  <dig>  identified unigenes,  <dig>   with significant matches in the database were assigned to  <dig> main categories that included  <dig> kegg pathways . among the  <dig> main categories that were identified, metabolism was the category with the greatest number of unigenes , followed by genetic information , organismal systems , cellular processes  and environmental information processing . these results indicate that active metabolic processes were occurring in the drought treatment condition. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the kegg metabolism category contained  <dig> sub-categories, including carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, biosynthesis involved in secondary metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and energy metabolism, among others.figure  <dig>

analysis of differential gene expression during the drought process
to reveal the molecular events occurring during the drought process, two digital gene expression  libraries were constructed using rna from the two pools of control and drought treatment rna samples and sequenced using illumina technology. after illumina sequencing and the removal of adaptors and bad-quality reads, approximately  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained for the two control replicates, and  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtain for the two replicates for the drought-treated plants. we then mapped the clean reads to the transcriptome reference data, and a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigene sequences were identified for the control replicates, and  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigene sequences were identified for the drought replicates. after calculating the expression level of each mapped unigene, a total of  <dig>  unigenes were detected that had levels of expression that were significantly different between the drought-treated and control libraries. no homologue was found in the ncbi database for  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes. both upregulation and downregulation of unigene expression occurred among the differentially expressed unigenes. among all differentially expressed unigenes,  <dig> were induced by drought treatment, and  <dig> were downregulated after one week of drought treatment. however, only  <dig> unigenes were functionally annotated with go terms , and only  <dig> unigenes were identified in the kegg pathway database . interestingly, approximately  <dig> % of the unigenes with known function fell into the categories related to fatty acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism , suggesting that these pathways and processes may participate in the drought response.figure  <dig>

previous studies have shown that transcription factors have a major effect on the network of drought-response genes. in this study, a total of  <dig> unigenes encoding known or putative transcription factors were found, including the wrky, myb, and ethylene-responsive transcription factors .

expression of selected genes differentially regulated between the two dge libraries
to confirm the gene expression data,  <dig> unigenes whose expression was upregulated in drought plants were randomly chosen from the two libraries for qrt-pcr analysis. among them,  <dig> unigenes were significantly upregulated in drought-treated plants, while the expression levels of the remaining  <dig> unigenes were not significantly different between the two libraries. as shown in figure  <dig>  the unigene expression trends were similar in both dge sequencing and qrt-pcr data. after examining the gene annotation information available for these unigenes, it was found that information on gene function was available for three unigenes; however, no matches in any database were obtained for the remaining  <dig> unigenes. these results suggest that some drought-resistance pathway genes may work together to defend the plant from drought stress.figure  <dig>

development and characterisation of est-ssr markers
to further evaluate the quality of the sequence data assembly and to develop new molecular markers, the  <dig>  unigenes generated in this study were used to mine potential microsatellites that were defined as mono- to hexanucleotide motifs with a minimum of three repetitions. using the misa software , a total of  <dig>  potential simple sequence repeats  were identified in  <dig>  unigenes. of these  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes contained one or more than one ssr, respectively . the number of potential est-ssrs per unigene varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> .table  <dig> 
summary of the est-ssrs that were identified in the transcriptome




using the ssr-containing sequences,  <dig> ssr sites were randomly selected to design est-ssr primers with the primer premier  <dig>  software. information about these est-ssr primers is shown in additional file  <dig>  among these  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig> were used successfully to pcr-amplify genomic dna , while the remaining seventeen pairs of primers failed to generate pcr products at several annealing temperatures. among the pcr products of the  <dig> working primer pairs,  <dig> pcr products appeared to result from specific amplification; among these  <dig> pcr products,  <dig> pcr products were of the expected sizes, while the other six pcr products were larger than the expected sizes, suggesting that the amplified regions likely contained introns. nine primer sets yielded pcr products that separated into more than one band, which may have resulted from either the primer design or the high heterozygosity of the h. ammodendron germplasm.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, a large number of h. ammodendron transcriptomic unigenes  were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform . the n <dig> length of the unigenes was  <dig>  bp, and the average length was  <dig> bp; these results were comparable to those obtained in recently published transcriptomic analyses of other plant species, such as reaumuria soongorica  and litchi . to date, trinity is one of most powerful software packages used for the de novo assembly of short reads. in this study, fewer than half of the unigenes  identified were successfully annotated using blast searches of the public nr, nt, swiss-prot, go, cog and kegg databases, given the absence of genomic information on h. ammodendron . notably, the percentage of unigenes that were annotated is the lowest among previous studies conducted using the same sequencing strategy during the previous year . it is possible that a larger percentage could not be annotated in this study due to technical limitations, such as sequencing depth or read length  <cit> , that are common to all studies that perform de novo transcriptome analyses. we found that the unannotated sequences were, on average, much shorter than the annotated unigenes .

the c <dig> pathway has been acknowledged to be more adaptive than the c <dig> pathway in response to abiotic stresses, such as high temperature, radiation and drought  <cit> .

h. ammodendron is a c <dig> plant, according to its physiological characteristics  <cit> . in this study, most of the genes encoding key enzymes involved in the c <dig> carbon fixation pathway were presented in the transcriptomic dataset from the annotation of the kegg pathway. the gene expression data confirmed the c <dig> character of h. ammodendron. the  <dig> c <dig> pathway genes that were identified were all downregulated in drought-treated plants compared with the controls. this result is consistent with the previous finding that the efficiency of the photosystem decreases in conditions of water deficiency.

it has long been known that extensive changes in gene expression occur when plants are exposed to drought stress  <cit> . generally, both upregulation and downregulation of gene expression occur under drought conditions. it has been reported that more genes are upregulated than are downregulated under drought stress in model plants  <cit> . in a. thaliana,  <dig>  genes have been found to be drought responsive; it is interesting to note that after  <dig> h of treatment,  <dig>   were found to be upregulated and  <dig>  downregulated, while after  <dig> h of treatment, nearly the same percentage of genes  was upregulated as was downregulated  <cit> . in cotton, over 16% of the genome exhibited altered expression levels in response to drought stress. among the genes whose expression levels were altered,  <dig>  genes were induced by drought shock, and  <dig>  were downregulated with  <dig> days of treatment  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified, but the proportion of the genome that is devoted to drought stress is unknown due to a lack of genome resources for this species. approximately half of the genes examined were found to be drought-inducible. these results suggest that plants vary in their abilities to adapt to drought stress. gene expression in desert plants may differ extensively from that in inland plants, and the differences in desert plants’ gene expression patterns may confer an enhanced ability to respond to drought stimuli. among the differentially expressed genes regulated by drought stress in h. ammodendron, over 50% had no homologues in the ncbi database. some of these genes may represent novel drought-responsive transcripts that have not been reported in other plants.

est-ssr markers are very important for research on a variety of topics, including the assessment of genetic diversity, the development of genetic maps, comparative genomics, marker assisted selection breeding, and others. to our knowledge, no previous study has reported the identification of esr-ssrs in this desert tree. transcriptome sequencing provided a large number of sequences that could be used to develop est-ssr markers in the h. ammodendron tree. in total,  <dig>  potential est-ssrs were identified in  <dig>  unigenes. in this study, in addition to the more common dinucleotide, trinucleotide and other nucleotide repeats that were included in the selection, mononucleotide repeat ssrs were also included, and the proportion of est-ssrs that were mononucleotide repeats was larger than those of the other types of repeats. trinucleotide repeats were the next-most abundant type, followed by dinucleotide repeats, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the most abundant dinucleotide and trinucleotide motifs were ag/tc and aag/ttc, respectively. these results are consistent with previous results for dicots such as oak trees  <cit>  and castor bean plants  <cit> . of  <dig> primer pairs randomly selected for pcr validation,  <dig>  produced clear bands. the pcr success rate was similar to that observed in several previous studies, such as in a study of poplar trees  <cit> , but higher than that reported in a study by triwitayakorn et al.   <cit> . therefore, the  <dig>  potential est-ssrs identified in this study will provide a wealth of resources for developing est-ssrs in the desert tree.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used high-throughput sequencing data to characterise the transcriptome of h. ammodendron, a species for which few genomic data are available. dge sequences were mapped to the assembled transcriptome for further gene expression analysis. a large number of candidate genes involved in drought stress were identified. furthermore, a set of est-ssrs were identified that have specific pcr products. this data represents a fully characterised transcriptome and provides a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies in desert plants.
