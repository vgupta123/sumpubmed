BACKGROUND
symbiotic nitrogen fixation  in legumes takes place in nodules, specialized organs that initiate by differentiation of root cells during invasion of the root by soil bacteria collectively known as rhizobia. ultimately, the rhizobia are deposited within host plant cells, separated by a plant-derived membrane. within mature nodules, rhizobia convert atmospheric nitrogen to bioavailable forms which it exchanges for photoassimilates from the plant host. this mutually beneficial symbiosis provides legumes and subsequent crops with a renewable nitrogen source. huge changes in gene expression in both the plant and rhizobia are observed during the differentiation to functional nodules. genetics has uncovered many rhizobial genes required for snf, but many plant genes essential to snf have yet to be discovered  <cit> . significant progress has been made via forward genetic studies in identifying essential plant genes required for the early nod-factor signaling pathway  <cit> . this pathway initiates nodule-specific plant gene expression in response to rhizobial lipochitooligosaccharide molecules called nodulation  factors. although some genes have been discovered that are required for steps after nod-factor signaling, many still await discovery and characterization.

forward genetics can identify new genes essential for snf, not biased by our presuppositions. successful forward genetics projects require an efficient mutagenesis technique to induce sufficient number of random mutations to saturate the genome and also fast and robust methods to identify the causative mutations in genes underlying mutant phenotypes.

medicago truncatula  is an excellent model to study legume-rhizobia interactions during snf because of its ease of laboratory manipulation and the availability of extensive genetic and genomic resources  <cit> . in m. truncatula, a large collection of genome-wide insertion mutants has been developed using the tobacco tnt <dig>  retrotransposon  <cit> . there are  <dig>  tnt <dig> insertion lines containing approximately  <dig>  random insertions available as a community resource for functional genomics studies  <cit> . the tnt <dig> transposon is a  <dig>  kb long autonomous copia-like element first isolated from tobacco   <cit> . tnt <dig> sequences encode a capsid-related protein , a protease , an integrase , a reverse transcriptase  and ribonuclease h , and contain a 610 bp long-terminal repeat  flanking each end of tnt <dig>  <cit> . tnt <dig> transposes autonomously by a copy-and-paste mechanism through an rna intermediate during somatic embryogenesis in tissue culture, thereby causing large numbers of random insertions across the genome  <cit> . previous studies in m. truncatula, based on southern blot analyses and flanking sequence tags  isolated by tail-pcr, established an average of  <dig> insertions per tnt <dig> line, with individual lines containing  <dig> to  <dig> independent insertions  <cit> . tnt <dig> has also been successfully used in large-scale genome-wide insertional mutagenesis of several other heterologous plant species including lettuce  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and potato  <cit> .

high-copy numbers of tnt <dig> insertions in the m. truncatula mutant lines are advantageous because fewer lines need to be generated to saturate the genome and fewer plants need to be screened in forward genetic screens to find mutants defective in pathways of interest. near-saturation mutagenesis also increases the success rates of reverse genetic screening to find tnt <dig> insertions in genes of interest  <cit> . however, high numbers of tnt <dig> insertions still pose significant challenges for forward genetic screens with recovery of fsts a rate-limiting step. traditional methods of fst identification, such as tail-pcr, adapter ligation pcr and plasmid rescue techniques, are not always efficient at identifying all the fsts in individual tnt <dig> mutants.

in m. truncatula, numerous mutants that are defective in nodule development and symbiotic nitrogen fixation were identified by forward genetic screening of tnt <dig> insertion populations  <cit> . despite the near-saturation mutagenesis of tnt <dig> insertion lines and the collection of mutants available for forward genetic screens, causative mutations for only a limited number of lines have been identified in this population by forward genetics  <cit> . whole genome sequencing  has revolutionized the identification of insertion mutations, caused by insertion of transposons or transfer-dnas , underlying the defective phenotypes of mutants from diverse organisms .

in this report, we demonstrate the successful use of wgs technology for the rapid identification of causative genes of m. trunctaula tnt <dig> mutants defective in nodulation identified from a forward genetic screen. we compare wgs results for tnt <dig> fsts with those obtained by tail-pcr and find that the wgs approach is more efficient.

RESULTS
forward genetic screening for m. truncatula mutants with nodulation defects
to identify novel genes required for nodule development and snf, we performed a forward genetic screen using the tnt <dig> insertion population in the m. truncatula r <dig> ecotype background  <cit> . primary screening for mutants was conducted at the m. truncatula community mutant screening workshops at the s. r. noble foundation. plants were grown on a mixture of perlite and sand  and regularly irrigated with media containing low nitrate . plants were inoculated with rhizobial strain sinorhizobium meliloti sm <dig>  <cit>  and screening was performed  <dig> weeks post inoculation . when grown under low nitrate and symbiotic conditions, r <dig> wild-type  plant shoots are green with roots having large ovoid pink nodules. the pink color of wt nodules is an indicator of efficient n <dig> fixation, caused by the abundant leghemoglobin protein  <cit> . in contrast, most snf mutants show restricted shoot growth with anthocyanin accumulation in aerial parts and have small bumps , spherical white nodules  or pinkish white  nodules on their roots instead of distinct pink nodules. approximately twelve r <dig> plants per tnt <dig> line were screened for defective symbiotic phenotypes and categorized by the severity of the defects observed  <cit>  to identify putative mutants.fig.  <dig> overview of forward genetic screening for symbiotic mutants and identification of causative genes. steps in forward genetic screening and identification of causative genes responsible for m. truncatula tnt <dig> mutants defective in nodule development and symbiotic nitrogen fixation are shown



secondary screening was performed to confirm phenotypes of putative mutants, using an aeroponic system as described previously  <cit> . the rhizobial strain s. meliloti rm <dig> hema:lacz was used in the secondary screening because rm <dig> is more efficient in inducing nodulation and snf in the r <dig> ecotype  <cit> . at  <dig> dpi, mutant plants were characterized for nitrogen deficiency phenotypes: leaf color and nodule shape, nodule color and rhizobial occupancy of sectioned nodules using x-gal  staining for the lacz gene contained in the rhizobial strain. mutants with clear nodule defects and snf phenotypes were selected for further characterization. among the mutants chosen for further characterization were those from lines nf <dig> and nf <dig>  both with nod + fix- phenotypes.

phenotypic characterization and segregation analysis of nf <dig> and nf <dig> mutants
individual plants from nf <dig> and nf <dig> lines show reddish purple leaves and form small spherical, white ineffective fix- nodules . x-gal stained nodule sections show that nf <dig> and nf <dig> nodules failed to form distinct nodule zones and show reduced rhizobial occupancy . to study the inheritance and penetrance of nod + fix- phenotypes, we backcrossed the mutants into the parental r <dig> ecotype  <cit> . all the bc1f <dig> plants from successful crosses showed wild-type shoot and nodule characteristics. the bc1f <dig> plants were allowed to self-fertilize. phenotyping of bc1f <dig> plants showed a 3: <dig>  segregation ratio for phenotypes associated with snf defects . these results indicate that the defective symbiotic phenotypes in nf <dig> and nf <dig> mutants are governed by monogenic, recessive mutations.fig.  <dig> phenotypic characterization of nf <dig> and nf <dig> plants. plants were grown on aeroponic chambers in the presence of 5 mm ammonium nitrate for 5 days, followed by 5 days without nitrogen, and subsequently inoculated with s. meliloti rm <dig> hema:lacz. phenotyping was performed 15 days post inoculation. a whole plants. wt leaves and petioles are green while the mutants’ leaves and petioles are reddish purple, caused by anthocyanin accumulation during nitrogen deficiency. scale bar = 1 cm. b visible nodule phenotype. wt nodules are pink; in comparison the mutants’ nodules are brownish or white. scale bar =  <dig>  mm. c rhizobial occupancy nodule phenotype. the nodules were fixed and stained with x-gal , sectioned to 100-micron-thickness, and imaged using bright field. scale bar = 100 μm

recovery of flanking sequence tags  using tail-pcr
the m. truncatula tnt <dig> mutant database contains  <dig>  high confidence flanking sequence tags  and  <dig>  low confidence fsts . these fsts were recovered by tail-pcr from r <dig> hemizygote plants  <cit> . in an effort to identify the mutations responsible for the defective symbiotic phenotypes in the relevant mutants, we used the available fsts to develop genetic markers to map and potentially identify the causative tnt <dig> insertions. to identify the genes with tnt <dig> inserts, we performed blast analysis of the fsts using r <dig> blast web browser  which aligns the fst genomic sequences to the r <dig> draft genome as well as the reference a <dig> genome  <cit> . because we anticipated that potential causative tnt <dig> insertions might be in nodule-specific genes, we cross-referenced to the m. truncatula gene expression atlas  database  and the a <dig> genome browser  for nodule gene expression.

for line nf <dig>  we found a total of  <dig> high confidence fsts in the m. truncatula tnt <dig> database  that mapped to the a <dig> genome . in addition, we performed a second round of tail-pcr from a single nf <dig> nod + fix- plant in the r <dig> generation and recovered a total of  <dig> fsts . among the  <dig> fsts,  <dig> were new and not recovered from r <dig> plants in the first round of tail-pcr. among these  <dig> r <dig> fsts,  <dig> mapped to the a <dig> and r <dig> genomes, while two mapped only to the r <dig> genome, and one matched neither . among the recovered  <dig> fsts in total, none of the annotated genes interrupted by tnt <dig> insertions were nodule-specific based on the mtgea database and a <dig> genome browser. a third round of tail-pcr from two single bc1f <dig> nf <dig> nod + fix- mutant plants recovered  <dig> fsts, with  <dig> novel fsts compared to the previous two rounds. as a whole, we isolated  <dig> unique fsts by tail-pcr in three different generations including r <dig>  r <dig> and bc1f <dig>  among them,  <dig> were mapped to unique sites in the a <dig> genome,  <dig> matched only to the r <dig> genome and there was one fst that did not match to either a <dig> or r <dig> genomes. none of the recovered fsts were mapped to nodule-specific genes .table  <dig> recovery of flanking sequence tags  from tnt <dig> insertion mutants nf <dig> and nf <dig> using tail-pcr from different generations



ainsertion locations of fsts in the a <dig> genome from r <dig> versus r <dig>  and r <dig> and r <dig> versus bc1f <dig> and r <dig> versus r <dig> were compared for nf <dig> and nf <dig>  respectively to identify novel, non-redundant fsts



for the nf <dig> mutant, we obtained  <dig> fsts  from tnt <dig> mutant database  and among them  <dig> fsts were mapped to the a <dig> genome. none of these fsts were found to be obvious candidate genes based on nodule specific gene expression . we performed an additional tail-pcr from an individual r <dig> mutant and recovered  <dig> novel fsts. as noted below, the same individual r <dig> mutant was subjected to wgs analysis. the tail-pcr analysis yielded a total of  <dig> non-redundant fsts from nf <dig> tail-pcr. among them, only  <dig> fsts were mapped to the a <dig> genome .

whole genome sequencing to recover tnt <dig> insertion sites
wgs approaches have been shown to be more sensitive and efficient, and have identified the causative t-dna insertions in arabidopsis thaliana and fungal mutants obtained from forward genetic screens in which tail-pcr, plasmid rescue and adapter ligation pcr techniques failed  <cit> . hence, we attempted wgs approach on the m. truncatula mutants using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform that provided  <dig> and  <dig> million 90 bp paired-end  clean reads from 500 bp insert libraries representing 44x and 40x total genome coverages of nf <dig> and nf <dig> mutants, respectively .table  <dig> summary of whole genome sequencing data and coverage estimates

btotal genome coverage was calculated based on the estimated medicago truncatula a <dig> genome size of 384 mb krishnakumar et al.,  <cit>  using the formula clean bases/reference genome size



paired end  sequencing generated two 90 bp short reads from both ends of a dna fragment hereafter referred to as read  <dig>  and read  <dig>  . each read from pe sequencing could match completely to the reference a <dig> genome , or tnt <dig> sequences only  or it could be a hybrid sequence comprised of parts of tnt <dig> element and r <dig> genome, thus representing the insertion site . the pe reads  from wgs can be classified as follows based on the sequence composition:  type 1: tnt1-tnt <dig>   type 2: genomic-genomic,  type 3: hybrid-tnt <dig> or tnt1-hybrid,  type 4: genomic-hybrid or hybrid-genomic and  type 5: genomic-tnt <dig> or tnt1-genomic . type  <dig> reads could be used to estimate the zygosity of insertion loci based on the genomic reads that mapped to the insertion junction sites  <cit> . the pe reads from types  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are informative for the identification of the tnt <dig> insertion sites.fig.  <dig> strategy for bioinformatic analyses of whole genome sequencing  data to identify tnt <dig> insertion sites. a tobacco  type i retrotransposon  genomic structure. tnt <dig> transposon sequences contain 610 bp long terminal repeats  on both left  and right ends , and encode a capsid protein , protease , an integrase , reverse transcriptase  and rnaseh . paired-end  sequencing reads obtained from tnt <dig> insertion mutants are classified into  <dig> different types: tnt1-tnt <dig> , genomic-genomic , hybrid-tnt <dig> or tnt1-hybrid , genomic-hybrid or hybrid-genomic  and genomic-tnt1or tnt1-genomic  based on the sequence composition. read types  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were used in our analyses. b workflow for the identification of tnt <dig> insertion loci using the wgs data. to identify the tnt <dig> insertion loci, a local blast program  <cit>  was used. clean pe reads were aligned to 90 bp le and re tnt <dig> sequences to identify type  <dig> reads. these are putative “hybrids” containing tnt1-genomic sequence junctions. type  <dig> and  <dig> reads were used to develop contigs/nodes using the velvet program  <cit>  to assemble genomic fragments. both hybrid reads and contigs/nodes were aligned to a <dig> reference genome by blast to obtain genomic co-ordinates of putative tnt <dig> insertion loci



an overview of the data analysis of wgs data to identify the tnt <dig> insertion sites are outlined in fig. 3b. to detect the tnt <dig> insertion sites from the wgs data, we employed a stand-alone blast program  <cit>  set up on a linux platform to align reads against the tnt <dig> sequence. this was done for all our blast analyses because the m. truncatula reference genome is from the a <dig> ecotype, while the tnt <dig> mutants are in r <dig> background, and therefore, alignment against tnt <dig> sequences alone circumvents the ambiguities because of polymorphisms between a <dig> and r <dig>  we aligned the pe reads r <dig> and r <dig> to both the left and right ends of tnt <dig> and recovered types  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads . type  <dig> and type  <dig> reads were assembled into contigs, called nodes. subsequently, we aligned the hybrid reads and nodes against the a <dig> reference genome to identify the genomic co-ordinates of the tnt <dig> insertions. ideally, each unique tnt <dig> insertion should be represented by all  <dig> types of supporting hybrid reads and nodes: types  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for each side of the tnt <dig> insertion. insertion loci with at least  <dig> supporting hybrid reads and/or nodes are considered high confidence  whereas the rest of the loci are considered low confidence . from this analysis, we identified  <dig> hc insertion loci for nf <dig> with  <dig> mapped to the a <dig> reference genome and the remaining  <dig> mapped to the a <dig> scaffolds only . we also found  <dig> lc insertion loci for nf <dig> . for nf <dig>  we identified a total of  <dig> hc insertion loci. among the hc loci,  <dig> were mapped to specific chromosomal locations while the remaining loci mapped to a <dig> scaffolds . for nf <dig>   <dig> lc tnt <dig> loci were obtained . mapping of some of these insertion loci showed that they are in the a <dig> scaffolds instead of chromosomal locations indicating gaps in the m. truncatula genome. the significance of the numerous lc insertion loci obtained for both lines is unclear.table  <dig> high confidence tnt <dig> insertion site statistics from whole genome sequencing




we attempted comparison between the hc tnt <dig> insertion locations obtained via tail-pcr and those obtained by wgs, although they are not strictly comparable because the tail-pcr tnt <dig> insertion locations were obtained from different generations of segregating and back-crossed populations, while the wgs data was obtained from only an individual bc1f <dig>  or r <dig>  mutant plant. for nf <dig>  tail-pcr identified a total of  <dig> tnt <dig> insertions while wgs recovered  <dig> hc insertion loci, with  <dig> tnt <dig> insertion loci identified by both approaches . for nf <dig>   <dig> unique tail-pcr and  <dig> hc wgs tnt <dig> fsts were found with  <dig> fsts common to both datasets . these data indicate that the wgs approach identified substantially more tnt <dig> insertion locations than tail-pcr. additionally, the tnt <dig> insertion locations identified by wgs were from an individual bc1f <dig> or r <dig> mutant plant for nf <dig> and nf <dig> respectively, which have already lost some non-co-segregating tnt <dig> insertions present in the r <dig> and r <dig> generations that were subjected to tail-pcr.fig.  <dig> comparison of tnt <dig> insertions obtained from tail-pcr and wgs. a unique high confidence tnt <dig> insertion sites that were recovered from r <dig>  r <dig> and bc1f <dig> generations of nf <dig> by tail-pcr were compared to those obtained from a single bc1f <dig> plant by wgs. b unique high confidence tnt <dig> insertion sites that were obtained from r <dig> and r <dig> generations of nf <dig> were compared to those obtained by wgs from a single r <dig> plant



nf <dig> and nf <dig> mutants are novel tnt <dig> insertion alleles of plc-like and nin genes, respectively
to identify the causative tnt <dig> insertions underlying the nodulation defects in nf <dig> and nf <dig>  we analyzed the genome coordinates of insertion loci from wgs data. one of the tnt <dig> insertion loci, insertion- <dig>  in nf <dig> with  <dig> supporting reads/nodes  mapped to the previously characterized defective in nitrogen fixation  <dig>  gene encoding a plc-like family protein . blast analysis revealed this tnt <dig> insertion maps to the 6th exon of dnf2/plc-like . the plc-like protein was reported to play an essential role in nodule development and symbiotic nitrogen fixation under non-permissive conditions . mutant nf <dig> plants have similar phenotypes  to those of the previously characterized dnf <dig> mutant nf <dig> in our growth conditions . some dnf <dig> mutant nodules have an apparent defense-like reaction producing brown-colored phenolic compounds, while others are white , like the phenotypes described when plants are grown on media solidified with agar  <cit> . the reasons for the variation in nodule phenotype in dnf <dig> mutant nodules is unknown  <cit> . genetic markers for the defective medtr4g <dig> allele were made and found to co-segregate with the defective snf phenotype in the bc1f <dig> population, with all wt bc1f <dig> plants in the population carrying at least one wt allele of medtr4g <dig> . hence, nf <dig> is a new allele of dnf <dig>  which we call dnf2- <dig> fig.  <dig> nf <dig> and nf <dig> contain novel tnt <dig> insertions in nodule inception  and phospholipase c -like, respectively. a a hybrid read example obtained for nf <dig> with the causative tnt <dig> insertion showing the tnt <dig> border sequence  and plc-like sequence . b genomic structure of plc-like indicating the tnt <dig> insertion site in nf <dig>  c representative co-segregation data for tnt <dig> insertions in nf <dig> co-segregating with nod + fix- plants. the top panel shows pcr products from pcr reactions with two primers specific for plc-like genomic sequences, medtr4g085800-1 f and medtr4g085800-1r, of 585 bp; the lower panel shows pcr products with one plc-like genomic primer, medtr4g085800-1 f, and one tnt <dig> primer, tnt-f <dig>  of 805 bp. lane  <dig> shows dna markers ; lane  <dig>  wt r <dig> dna; and lanes 3- <dig>  nod + fix- plants in the nf <dig> bc1f <dig> population. d a hybrid read example obtained for nf <dig> with the causative tnt <dig> insertion showing the tnt <dig> border sequence  and nin sequence . e genomic structure of nin indicating the tnt <dig> insertion site in nf <dig>  f representative co-segregation data for tnt <dig> insertions in nf <dig> co-segregating with nod + fix- plants. the top panel shows pcr products from pcr reactions with two primers specific for nin genomic sequences, medtr5g099060-1 f and medtr5g099060-1r, of 503 bp; the lower panel shows pcr products with one nin genomic primer, medtr5g099060-1 f, and one tnt <dig> primer, tnt-r <dig>  of 810 bp. lane  <dig> shows dna markers; lane  <dig>  wt r <dig> dna; and lanes 3– <dig>  nod + fix- plants in the nf <dig> bc1f <dig> population. additional pcr genotyping data for nf <dig> and nf <dig> wt-like and nod + fix- plants from bc1f <dig> can be found in additional file 12: table s <dig> and additional file 13: table s <dig>  respectively. genotyping primers are listed in additional file 15: table s11



analysis of wgs data for nf <dig> identified a tnt <dig> insertion in the fourth exon of a previously characterized nodule specific gene nodule inception . this insertion locus, insertion- <dig>  has  <dig> supporting reads/nodes  confirming the tnt <dig> insertion in nin gene. nin is a key transcriptional factor which plays a major role in the formation of infection threads, induction of cortical cell divisions and regulation of nodule formation . in this case, the second round of tail-pcr obtained from a single nf <dig> nod + fix- plant from r <dig> generation also identified a tnt <dig> insertion in nin . to test whether the interrupted nin gene is responsible for the underlying nod + fix- phenotype of nf <dig> tnt <dig> mutant line, we performed co-segregation analysis using the bc1f <dig> population obtained from a nf <dig> × r <dig> cross. pcr genotyping showed that all tested bc1f <dig> plants with a nod + fix- phenotype were homozygous for the tnt <dig> insertion in nin gene whereas all the tested wt phenotype plants had at least one wt uninterrupted nin allele . these data indicate that nf <dig> contains a new nin allele, which we have named nin- <dig>  most of the previously reported m. truncatula nin mutants showed a nod- phenotype  <cit> . conceptual translation of nin- <dig> shows that it encodes a putative  <dig> amino acid hybrid protein, with the first  <dig> amino acid residues of nin followed by ten amino acid residues encoded by tnt <dig> . it has the first six conserved blocks of sequence found in nin and nin-like proteins, including the characteristic rwp-rkp domain thought to be important for dimerization and dna binding activity in regulation of genes controlled by nitrogen status  <cit> , but lacks the last conserved sequence block containing the pb <dig> domain, putatively vital for hetero-dimerization  <cit>  . our genetic data lead us to hypothesize that the fix- nodule phenotype in nf <dig> is likely caused by the weak nin- <dig> allele as opposed to a cryptic defect in a different, closely-linked gene. other observations support the idea that a weak nin allele could have such a phenotype. first, there is a brief description of another m. truncatula nin allele, also a tnt <dig> insertion in the last exon of nin, as nod+/fix-, while other nin alleles with tnt <dig> insertions in the last nin exon are nod-  <cit> . second, in mature determinate l. japonicus nodules, nin expression persists which indicates that nin likely has a role later in nodule development as well as in nodule inception  <cit> . third, nin expression in indeterminate m. truncatula nodules has highest expression in the nodule infection zone and significant expression in the inter-zone and nitrogen fixing zones  <cit> . our data indicate that nf <dig> is expected to contain a partially functional nin protein. this new allele could be valuable in further dissecting nin’s function after nodule inception, in rhizobial infection and in nodule organogenesis.

overall, our data show that while tail-pcr is useful in identifying the causative tnt <dig> fsts in some mutants, wgs is more efficient in pinpointing the fsts. in this work, with >40x total genome coverage, we were able to identify the mutations underlying the defects in two mutants. previously, it was reported that 10x genome coverage is enough to identify 96 % of the insertions from m. truncatula  <cit> . the optimal sequencing coverage required to identify the causative insertions in mutants from a forward genetic screen was not reported previously for m. truncatula. wgs is increasingly becoming more cost-effective and accurate. the availability of several commercial vendors for genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis has facilitated rapid data acquisition, allowing researchers to focus on the genetic characterization of identified genes and biochemical characterization of their encoded proteins, speeding up forward genetics. tail-pcr is still a valuable tool for forward genetics, but the success rate of wgs for forward genetic screens is significantly higher, as reported in previous studies in other organisms  <cit> , and now established for m. truncatula by our study.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we demonstrate that wgs is an efficient approach for the recovery of high numbers of tnt <dig> insertion sites from m. truncatula tnt <dig> insertion mutants. our results demonstrated that wgs efficiency clearly surpassed that of tail-pcr. we also showed the utility of the wgs method in identifying relevant disrupted genes in two mutants isolated in a forward genetic screen as defective in snf nodule development. this work uncovered a new dnf2- <dig> allele with phenotypes similar to dnf <dig> mutants previously described. it also described a new nin- <dig> mutant that showed defects later in nodule development than other nin mutants. this weak nin allele is likely to be valuable in characterizing nin’s functions later in nodule development, after nodule inception.
