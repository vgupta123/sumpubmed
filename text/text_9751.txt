BACKGROUND
francisella tularensis is a gram-negative bacterium that causes a potentially life-threatening disease called tularemia  <cit> . there are several subspecies of francisella but f. tularensis tularensis and f. tularensis holarctica, also known as type a and type b, respectively, are the most prevalent. type a isolates have been classified as a category a select agent of biological warfare. they are typically restricted to north america, and can cause a severe infection that is potentially fatal, particularly if untreated. type b isolates are found primarily in the northern hemisphere, and cause a milder disease that is rarely fatal. these bacteria are zoonotic organisms that can infect hundreds of different species. f. tularensis is usually transmitted to humans, an incidental host, by the bite of an arthropod vector but it is also possible to become infected through an aerosol route.

f. tularensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can invade a variety of cell types including macrophages, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes  <cit> . in macrophages f. tularensis exhibits a rather unusual intracellular lifestyle. most intracellular bacteria reside and replicate within a remodeled phagosome that is able to avoid lysosomal fusion through a variety of mechanisms. other bacteria rapidly escape the phagosome after invasion and replicate directly in the cytoplasm. francisella seems to have combined these two pathways; after uptake it remains in a phagosome for three to six hours before escaping to, and replicating in the cytosol  <cit> . a few factors have been identified that regulate or facilitate phagosome escape and intracellular survival of f. tularensis  <cit> , but relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms or necessary requirements of this intracellular lifestyle. to gain a better understanding of the requirements for invasion, phagosome escape, and intracellular replication and survival, we created a transposon mutagenesis library of the type a strain schu s <dig> using ez::tn <rpslprparr-2>, a derivative of the ez::tn transposon system®  <cit> . schu s <dig> is a human isolate, and its genome has been completely sequenced  <cit> . approximately  <dig> mutants were screened for the inability to replicate in the hepatic cell line, hepg <dig>  this cell line was chosen because mouse studies of tularemia have indicated that the liver is the primary site of tularemia pathology, and intracellular bacteria are visible in hepatocytes  <cit> . the range of mutants isolated in this screen has identified some key aspects of the requirements for intracellular survival in a hepatic cell line. further characterization of these mutants will help to define the pathways, and processes that lead to successful infection.

RESULTS
construction of a transposon-insertion library of schu s4
we used the transposon ez::tn<rpslprparr-2> to create a transposon-insertion library of the f. tularensis type a strain schu s <dig> . this transposon was previously used to identify mutants in rickettsia prowazekii and carries the gene rparr- <dig>  which encodes an enzyme that inactivates rifampin by adp-ribosylation  <cit> . the transposon was isolated from pmw <dig> by restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. the purified transposon was incubated with transposase, and then the "transposome" complex was introduced into schu s <dig> by electroporation. rifampin-resistant colonies were selected on mha plates containing rifampin. approximately  <dig>  rifampin-resistance colonies were isolated, individually grown, and frozen in  <dig> well microtiter plates. the presence of the transposon in the rifampin-resistant colonies was verified by pcr amplification of the transposon from dna isolated from the mutants using transposon-specific primers bm <dig> and 3'arr- <dig> . the transposition frequency was approximately  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per input colony forming unit .

to examine the randomness of the transposition event the transposon with its flanking dna was rescued from  <dig> colonies by digesting the dna with bcl <dig>  self-ligating the fragments, and introducing them into pir+e. coli. the dna flanking the transposon was sequenced, and found to be 100% identical to schu s <dig> sequences. the location of each transposon insertion site on a chromosomal map of schu s <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  two insertion sites appeared to be in intergenic regions while the rest were within putative open reading frames. the insertion sites were generally spread around the chromosome with no major hotspots, however there were three regions of significant size to which no insertion sites mapped.

to test the stability of the transposition event ten mutants were replated five times on mha with or without rifampin. in all cases rifampin resistance was stable. in two strains the dna flanking the transposon was sequenced, and found to be identical to that of the original rescued plasmid. these results indicated that the transposon was stable once integrated into the schu s <dig> genome.

isolation of mutants defective in intracellular survival in hepg <dig> cells
to identify potential virulence factors, and also define requirements for intracellular survival of schu s <dig>  the transposon-insertion library was screened for mutants defective in intracellular survival. we screened  <dig>  independent mutants by incubating each mutant with hepg <dig> cells in a microtiter well. after two hours the cells were washed, and gentamicin was added. after a  <dig> hr incubation the cells were lysed, and each lysate was transferred to a mha plate and further incubated for  <dig> hours . strains that failed to grow on the mha plate were retested two more times. twenty-seven mutants were finally identified that failed to replicate within hepg <dig> cells. the location of the transposon insertion site in the schu s <dig> genome for each mutant was determined . eighteen different genes were identified from these  <dig> mutants. in all cases the transposon inserted in orientation such that the direction of transcription of the rparr- <dig> gene was the same as the disrupted open reading frame. this suggests that the rickettsia rpsl promoter was not active in schu s <dig>  and that the expression of the rparr- <dig> gene was driven by the nearest upstream promoter. a southern blot of dna isolated from  <dig> of these strains, and hybridized with a probe specific for rparr- <dig>  demonstrated that each mutant had a single integrated copy of en::tn<rpslprparr-2> . fifteen of the  <dig> genes disrupted by a transposon had annotations for a predicted gene function . only three were designated as hypothetical. in several of these mutants the transposon had inserted into a gene that appeared to be part of an operon, therefore the defect in intracellular survival in these mutants may be due to a polar effect on downstream genes. eight of the  <dig> mutants were auxotrophs. seven of these  <dig> auxotrophic mutants had transposon insertions in genes involved in purine or pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis.

characterization of a mutant in the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway
the initial enzymes in the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway appear to be encoded by a three-gene operon consisting of cara, carb, and pyrb . the products of these genes are carbamoyl-phosphate synthase , and aspartate carbamoyltransferase. the phenotype of bjm <dig>  was characterized in greater detail. b. abortus pyrb mutants are defective in intracellular growth in macrophages though these bacteria reside within phagosomes  <cit> . as expected, bjm <dig> required added uracil, and not arginine for growth on minimal cdm . the ability of bjm <dig> to invade and replicate in hepg <dig> was compared to wild-type schu s <dig> . at three hours post infection there were approximately one third fewer intracellular cfus of bjm <dig> than schu s <dig>  at  <dig> hours the number of cfus of schu s <dig> had increased more than  <dig> fold while bjm <dig> numbers increased approximately  <dig> fold. at  <dig> hours the number of schu s <dig> bacteria remained roughly constant and bjm <dig> had again about a 50-fold increase. at  <dig> hrs the number of schu s <dig> had begun to decline, while bjm <dig> continued to slowly increase. in summary, the growth defect of bjm <dig> in hepg <dig> cells manifested early in infection, however the bacteria continued to grow, albeit at low levels, for at least  <dig> hrs post-infection.

the ability of bjm <dig> to invade and replicate in j <dig>  cells, a murine macrophage-derived cell line, was also examined. j <dig>  cells were infected with bacteria at an moi to 50: <dig> in microtiter wells in triplicate. after  <dig> hrs the media was replaced with media containing gentamicin. the wells were lysed at  <dig>  and  <dig> hrs, diluted, and spread on mha plates to determine the number of intracellular cfus. in contrast to hepg <dig> cells, intracellular growth of bjm <dig> in j <dig>  cells was similar to schu s <dig>  at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs the number of cfus recovered from bjm <dig> and schu s <dig> infected cells was approximately the same. at  <dig> hrs the number of intracellular bacteria in both strains had increased by about  <dig> logs. although the same number of host cells and moi were initially used to infect hepg <dig> and j <dig>  cells, the number of cfus recovered from j <dig>  cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs was nearly  <dig> logs higher than with hepg <dig> cells. the experiment with j <dig>  cells could not be continued past the  <dig> hour time point because the j <dig>  cells began to die. several other mutants were tested for intracellular growth in j <dig>  cells . among  <dig> mutants tested, bjm <dig>  and bjm <dig>  were profoundly defective in intracellular growth in j <dig>  cells while two others, bjm <dig> and bjm <dig>  were moderately defective. the mutant strains that grew similarly to schu s <dig> in j <dig>  cells were bjm <dig>  bjm <dig>  bjm <dig>  bjm <dig>  bjm <dig>  bjm <dig>  and bjm <dig>  these results suggest that the requirements for intracellular growth, or possibly the intracellular environment of f. tularensis in these two cell lines are quite different.

to determine whether the delayed growth phenotype of bjm <dig> in hepg <dig> cells translated to attenuation in vivo, mice were infected with approximately  <dig> or  <dig> cfus of bjm <dig> or schu s <dig> by an intranasal route. all mice infected with  <dig> cfus of schu s <dig> died or were euthanized on day  <dig>  all mice infected with  <dig> cfus of schu s <dig> died or were euthanized on day  <dig>  some attenuation of bjm <dig> was observed; three out of four mice challenged with  <dig> cfus of bjm <dig> died on day  <dig>  which was a two day delay compared to a similar inoculum of schu s <dig>  two out of four mice challenged with  <dig> cfus bjm <dig> also died on day  <dig>  the three remaining mice appeared healthy with normal activity until day  <dig>  when they were euthanized. by gross examination the livers of the surviving mice appeared normal, however bacteria were isolated from liver homogenates. these results suggest that the ability to grow within hepg <dig> cells correlates with in vivo virulence.

discussion
f. tularensis is remarkable for its ability to infect an array of mammals, arthropods, and even protozoa with an infectious dose of  <dig> organisms or less  <cit> . to accomplish these feats, the bacterium must have devised efficient means of infecting its host, and effective ways of avoiding host defense mechanisms. a key component of successful infection should rely at least in part on its ability to invade, survive, and replicate inside host cells. the intracellular lifestyle of f. tularensis in macrophages represents a novel paradigm for intracellular survival. once inside a macrophage f. tularensis is able to escape from the phagosome and replicate in the cytoplasm. unlike other cytosolic intracellular bacteria such as shigella sp and listeria monocytogenes, which escape from their phagosomes within minutes after entering host cells  <cit> , francisella resides in phagosomes that acquire endosomal markers such as early endosomal antigen   <dig> and the late endosomal markers   <dig> and  <dig>  for three to six hrs after infection before escaping into the cytoplasm  <cit> . in this study we used a random mutagenesis approach to identify genes in f. tularensis that contribute to this novel pathway of intracellular survival and replication.

a stable transposon-mutagenesis library was constructed in schu s <dig>  a virulent isolate of f. tularensis tularensis. nearly all of the transposon-insertion sites were located within open reading frames. it therefore appears that an upstream endogenous promoter drove the transcription of the transposon-encoded rifampin-resistance gene rparr- <dig> in schu s <dig>  therefore our library is not completely comprehensive because mutations in genes that are poorly expressed in our culture conditions would not have been isolated. we screened our library for mutants defective in intracellular survival in hepg <dig> cells. a hepatic cell line was chosen because in the mouse tularemia model, regardless of the route of infection, bacteria disseminate to the liver  <cit> . the genes that were disrupted in these mutants provide insights into the pathways and processes that are required for intracellular replication and survival of f. tularensis. we did not identify in our screen any mutants in the  <dig> kb pathogenicity island in f. tularensis that encodes several novel proteins including igla, iglc, pdpa and pdpb, which are required for intracellular replication and survival of f. novicida in macrophages  <cit> . this was not unexpected because this pathogenicity island is duplicated in schu s <dig>  by chance one of the randomly selected mutants, which was not defective in intracellular growth, had a transposon inserted in pdpa .

seven out of the eight auxotrophic mutants identified in our screen had transposon insertions in genes involved in purine or pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. intact purine or pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways have been found to be important for the virulence of several other intracellular bacteria that reside within phagosomes, including brucella abortus  <cit> , brucella suis  <cit> , salmonella typhimurium  <cit> , and mycobacteria tuberculosis  <cit> . purine prototrophy has also been shown to be important for the intracellular survival and virulence of shigella flexneri, a bacterium that replicates in the cytoplasm  <cit> . in our study the pyrb mutant, bjm <dig>  was defective in intracellular replication in hepg <dig> cells, though it was able to continue to grow at reduced levels. bjm <dig> was also attenuated in mice, exhibiting a delayed time to death when compared to schu s <dig>  although this is a single mutant, it suggests that the ability to replicate within hepg <dig> cells may be useful as a correlative test for virulence in vivo. this mutant showed no growth defects in j <dig>  cells. these results suggest that the availability or accessibility of pyrimidines to the bacteria is different in these two cell types. the intracellular fate of f. tularensis has really only been examined carefully in macrophages or macrophage cell lines, and not in hepatocytes or hepatic cell lines. the time course of phagosomal escape may be different in hepatic cells or may not even occur. the differences in the ability of some of our mutants to replicate in these two cell types may be a reflection of the exposure of f. tularensis to different intracellular compartments or environments, or some species-specific factors since hepg <dig> cells are a human-derived cell line and j <dig>  have a murine origin.

most intracellular gram-negative bacteria reside within a phagosome, and have developed different mechanisms to avoid fusion with lysosomes. the best-studied exceptions are shigella sp., which survive and replicate directly in the cytoplasm. one explanation for this skew is that the cytoplasm is not a particularly hospitable environment for bacterial growth and survival. although the intracellular fate of f. tularensis in hepatocytes has not been studied in detail, two mutants obtained in our screen, dsbb and ggt, disulfide bond formation protein b and gamma-glutamyl transferase , respectively, suggest that f. tularensis is in contact with the cytosol in hepatocytes, and may reflect f. tularensis adaptation to living in the cytoplasm. the cytosol is a reducing environment due to glutathione reductase, and contains high levels of reduced glutathione, which is necessary to inhibit protein folding in the cytoplasm  <cit> . the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria typically contain several disulfide bond formation proteins that catalyze disulfide bond exchange and help to maintain the balance of redox potential  <cit> . dsba catalyzes disulfide bond formation and dsbb oxidizes dsba back to its active oxidized form. a functional dsbb appears to be critical for f. tularensis intracellular growth because this mutant exhibited one of the most severe growth defective phenotypes in both hepg <dig> and j <dig>  cells.

dsba has been identified as a virulence-associated gene in several other pathogens  <cit> . dsba also has a role in the formation of pili. it is required for biogenesis of the type iv pili of the vibrio cholerae toxin-coregulated pilus and the bundle forming pilus of enteropathogenic e. coli  <cit> . genes that could encode a type iv pili are found within the genome of schu s <dig>  <cit> . a role for type iv pili in invasion or intracellular survival has not been defined but a knockout mutant in a potential pilin-encoding gene in a type b isolate is attenuated by a subcutaneous route in mice, and is impaired in its ability to spread to the spleen  <cit> .

another potential adaptation to survival in the reducing cytosol could be the activity of ggt. this enzyme has a major role in glutathione metabolism  <cit> . ggt is the first enzyme in the degradation pathway of glutathione, and transfers a gamma-glutamyl moiety from glutathione to amino acids. ggt can also use gamma-glutamyl peptides as substrates in the reciprocal hydrolysis reaction, thus contributing to the synthesis of glutathione. ggt in francisella may also help to control the influx of glutathione from the cytosol. further studies on these mutants will help define the roles of these gene products in intracellular survival.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first reported large-scale mutagenesis and screening of a type a strain of f. tularensis. we have identified several genes and pathways that are key for the survival, and growth of a type a strain of f. tularensis in a hepatic cell line. conlan et al have shown in a mouse model of tularemia that, regardless of the route of entry, the liver appears to be a primary site of pathology, and intracellular bacteria are visible in hepatocytes  <cit> . defects in the growth of mutants in pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis pathways suggest that these pathways are important for optimal intracellular growth, but the slow growth of the pyrb mutant inside hepg <dig> cells and in vivo indicates that the bacteria must be able to procure some nucleobases from the host. several mutants defective in hepg <dig> intracellular growth were able to grow similarly to wild-type bacteria in a murine macrophage-derived cell line, suggesting that the intracellular environment, resources, and/or compartment available to the bacteria in these two cells types are different. however, the identification of dsbb and ggt mutants suggests that f. tularensis is in contact with the cytosol in hepg <dig> cells. we also identified a number of novel intracellular growth-defective mutants that have not been previously characterized in other pathogens. further characterization of these mutants will provide a better understanding of the pathogenicity of f. tularensis, and may have practical applications as attenuated vaccines or through the identification of targets for new therapeutics.
