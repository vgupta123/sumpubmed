BACKGROUND
abiotic stresses are major factors that affect the growth, development, and productivity of crops. most studies have mainly focused on individual stresses, such as cold, drought, and high salinity  <cit> . however, different stresses might occur simultaneously in the field; thus, crops can suffer from the superimposition of these stresses  <cit> . hence, cross−breeding or marker−assisted breeding, which targets single abiotic stress, might be insufficient for enhancing the performance of crops in the field. therefore, the combination of different stresses should be considered in evaluating tolerance and stress−related molecular mechanism  <cit> .

summer drought with heat waves has been noticed in grape−producing regions  <cit> . the mechanisms of drought–heat effects have also been reported in different plants  <cit> . in addition to summer drought, grapevine routinely suffers from dry winter; during this season, regions such as north china with extremely continental climate experience a low temperature and air humidity with little snow  <cit> . frozen water in the soil supporting the main roots results in limited water use in the soil by grapevine plants during winter, on the contrary, transpiration by woody tissues  from grapevine canes is relatively high due to low humidity. all vitis vinifera cultivars can’t be survival under natural condition in the main chinese grape−producing areas in north china. to have economy income, all grapevine canes should be buried during winter, even if the temperature is higher than −10°c. this process requires more labor, and thus, increases product cost. generally, extremely low temperature could damage the bud and cane of grapevines  <cit> . moreover, the combination of drought–cold stress in winter in north china might result in death of shoots, even death of young trees such as in apple trees which can be survival under individual cold stress  <cit> . even a special term ‘choutiao’ in chinese is given for the phenomenon concerning death of shoots or whole trees due to drought stress under cold winter and some special culture management were developed to overcome drought–cold stress in apple trees  <cit> .

various evaluation methods are available for quantifying the tolerances to individual drought or cold stress in the laboratory  <cit> . measuring electrolyte leakage  is one of the most frequently used methods to assess plant tolerance in response to drought and low temperature  <cit> . abiotic stresses induce cell membrane injury, leading to intracellular ion efflux. el measurement can reflect the change of ion exosmosis, and determine the cell damage level. half−lethal temperature  is widely considered to represent the low−temperature tolerance in plants. the lt <dig> value can be generally calculated by el measurement defined as the temperature at which el decreases to 50% of that under optimal growth conditions  <cit> . however, this method is time consuming  <cit> . moreover, severe stress  could seriously damage the membrane structure and cause secondary stress to the samples, thus affecting the accuracy of the method  <cit> . few studies have focused on the combination of the two stresses. however, the damages induced by drought and cold have several common characteristics. both stresses may cause cell dehydration and accumulation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in damaged membrane and photosynthesis system at cellular level  <cit> . consequently, tolerance to combined stress could be quantified through methodologies similar to those for each individual stress.

the negative impacts on photosynthesis have been widely studied under abiotic stresses, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurement has been proven as an efficient and reproducible tool for evaluating plant susceptibility index to drought  <cit>  or low temperature  <cit>  stresses. this method reflects the susceptibility to the damages of the photo system ii  in the photosynthesis electron transport chains  <cit> . as a nondestructive diagnostic tool, chlorophyll fluorescence method shows more benefits compared with el measurement, especially the more rapid process induces less secondary stresses to the samples. moreover, different parameters  can be measured  <cit> .

in the present study, we mimicked a drought–cold stress condition by coupling polyethylene glycol −induced water−deficit hydroponic culture system with cooling environment. fluorescence parameters were determined to evaluate the tolerance of grapevine to combined drought−cold stress. we established a novel model to estimate lt <dig> values using fv/fm measurement based on the correlation between the el and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the grape leaves exposed under combined drought–cold stress condition. this model simplifies the evaluation of the damages caused by drought–cold stress. the proposed model can be readily applied to determine the tolerance of the grape germplasm and cross–progeny individuals to breed drought–cold–tolerant grapevines.

RESULTS
individual drought and cold tolerance of v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg’
after exposure to peg−simulated drought stress for  <dig> d, v. amurensis showed significantly lower el than ‘muscat hamburg’  at all peg levels . v. amurensis showed a lower increase in el than that of ‘muscat hamburg’  at 10% peg compared with the controls. the el difference between v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg’ increased as peg concentration increased. moreover, leaf relative water content  was lower in ‘muscat hamburg’ than that in v. amurensis under peg stress, particularly at high peg concentration . rwc  was significantly lower in ‘muscat hamburg’ than that in v. amurensis under 6%, 8%, and 10% peg treatments, respectively. the effect of the transpiration volume of the plantlets on the water potential of nutrient solution was also investigated. we filled the solution with distilled water to the initial volume every 12h after treatment. the two grape species exhibited significant phenotypic differences .figure  <dig>

to determine cold tolerance, we examined lt <dig> values calculated based on the measured els in both species. the lt <dig> values of v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg’ were − <dig>  and − <dig> °c, respectively; and they were significantly different in lt <dig> values between the previous two genotypes . the different tolerances of v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg’ to the two individual stresses could be used as foundation for subsequent combined studies.

tolerances to drought–cold stress evaluated using el–based lt <dig> value
to establish optimal conditions for combined stress, we performed a series of preliminary examinations for drought and low–temperature treating modes. a suitable peg concentration should immediately trigger plant physiological responses and effectively discriminate drought tolerance among genotypes. however, the nutrient solution should remain unfrozen under the given freezing condition; freezing causes lower water potential  <cit>  and therefore decreases the accuracy of the peg concentration. according to these criteria and the results in figure 1a, we selected 4%, 6%, and 8% as the candidate peg concentrations. we then assessed the freezing pattern of the three peg solutions at −6°c based on the pre−experiment, which showed that even v. amurensis exhibited severe water−soaking damage and el almost reached the upper limit in all peg concentrations at temperatures lower than −6°c. moreover, 6% and 8% peg remained unfrozen in the solution for  <dig> h , whereas the solutions without peg or with 4% peg became frozen. finally, 6% peg, which induced moderate stress compared with 8% peg, was selected for subsequent experiments.

el was measured in both genotypes under 6% peg coupled with simultaneous cooling treatment in both gradient cooling  and non−acclimated freezing  modes. low temperature significantly increased the el values in both species; the increase in el was higher in ‘muscat hamburg’ than that in v. amurensis . el was significantly different between the two genotypes from −4°c to −7°c under naf mode, while the significant differences under gc mode were only observed at −4°c and −5°c. under gc mode, the el values in both genotypes slightly increased at initial degrees, whereas inflection point increased at high temperature in ‘muscat hamburg’  compared with that in v. amurensis . moreover, el slowly increased under naf mode compared with that under gc mode. lt <dig> values were calculated based on the el data. as shown in figure 2e, the lt <dig> values of v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg’ were − <dig> ± <dig> °c and − <dig> ± <dig> °c under gc mode and − <dig> ± <dig> °c and − <dig> ± <dig> °c under nac mode, respectively.figure  <dig>

chlorophyll fluorescence response
as shown in figure  <dig>  we examined three chlorophyll fluorescence parameters  under drought–cold stress at the two cooling modes. fo rapidly increased at temperatures lower than −4°c under both gc  and naf  modes. moreover, fo was significantly higher in ‘muscat hamburg’ than that in v. amurensis at −6°c or/and −7°c. the fv/fm  and fv/fo  values decreased as temperature decreased under both cooling modes. in addition, a more rapid decrease of their values in ‘muscat of hamburg’ was observed than those in v. amurensis and significant difference was observed at −5°c at both cooling modes.figure  <dig>

to establish an lt <dig> estimation model based on chlorophyll fluorescence responses, we should ensure a good correlation between el and the candidate parameters. all the three chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were significantly correlated with el under both cooling modes . interestingly, the cooling modes affected the coefficient of correlation for different chlorophyll fluorescence−to−el pairs. fv/fm and fv/fo showed higher correlations with el under gc than those under naf. the low correlation under naf was mainly caused by the non−synchronous variation in the responses of chlorophyll fluorescence and el to the decreasing temperatures. fv/fm and fv/fo reached their higher limits when el was approximately 20%; thereafter, any further increase in el  was not accompanied by a proportional decrease in the two chlorophyll florescence parameters . the fv/fm under gc showed the highest correlation with el  among the three candidate parameters, and the two genotypes exhibited a unique regression line ; thus, fv/fm was selected as the model for further analysis.figure  <dig>

lt <dig> estimation model under drought–cold stress based on chlorophyll fluorescence
to confirm the reliability of our “peg 6%+gc” system and the use of fv/fm as an alternative indicator of cold tolerance, we applied these parameters in the four other grape genotypes. figure  <dig> shows the comparison between the lt <dig> values obtained from el in the four newly investigated genotypes with those of the two genotypes used during system establishment under drought–cold stress. the lowest lt <dig> values were observed in v. amurensis at − <dig> °c, whereas the highest in ‘cardinal’ at − <dig> °c.figure  <dig>

as shown in figure  <dig>  high correlations  were observed between el and fv/fm under gc mode for all the tested cultivars. in addition, all cultivars presented similar linear regression slope between fv/fm and el; however, some differences were observed in their intercepts . this synchronization between the responses of fv/fm to el under gc mode confirms the reliability of fv/fm as an effective indicator of cold tolerance. therefore, we compared the lt <dig> estimated from fv/fm with the values estimated from classic el values.figure  <dig>

figure  <dig> and s <dig> demonstrate the comparison of the lt <dig> obtained from el with those obtained from fv/fm under gc mode. a close correlation was observed between lt50–el and lt50−fv/fm for all genotypes. the values of lt50–fv/fm were consistent with those of lt50–el. a minor absolute difference of  <dig> °c , a low relative difference of  <dig> % , and a very high agreement index of  <dig> % were obtained. all these indexes indicate that lt50–fv/fm provides a reliable and precise representation of lt50–el. paired t tests have revealed that lt50−el and lt50−fv/fm values were significantly different in the two genotypes  under naf, whereas no difference was observed under gc mode . this finding indicates that gc mode provided more consistent results between lt50−el and lt50–fv/fm, and thus, more suitable for this system.figure  <dig>

discussion
experimental system of combined stress
mittler  <cit>  emphasized that combined stress is not merely an addition of two individual stresses; the physiological and molecular mechanisms of combined stress should be studied and regarded as a novel stress. some studies have elucidated the plant tolerance mechanisms to drought−heat  <cit> , salinity−heat  <cit> , drought−ozone  <cit> , and drought–heat–virus  <cit> . however, the combination of drought and low–temperature stresses has been rarely reported except for the study on wheat  <cit> . this unique stress combination should be considered for actual fruit production. an accurate and simple method for evaluation is crucial for subsequent physiological and molecular research. the parents for breeding new cultivars with high resistance to the combined stress should be selected through stress evaluation at the germplasm level.

establishing a suitable experimental platform for stress mimic is the prerequisite for evaluating drought–cold stress. in this study, the grape plant tissues cultured with 6% peg solution under gc mode were subjected to a simulated drought–cold stress. peg−induced hydroponic culture results in decreased water utilization by plants and is used for stable drought simulation because it is quantifiable and can be easily maintained. this culture condition is comparable with dry soil in winter; in which the frozen state causes unavailability of water in the upper soil layer, where most grapevine roots are distributed. in addition, in vitro grapevine hydroponic system exhibits rapid and easily reproducible abilities; this finding has also been observed on some other horticultural crops, such as apple  <cit> , banana  <cit> , sugar beet  <cit> , and poplar  <cit> . by contrast to the classic method that uses detached leaves to evaluate cold tolerance  <cit> , we used tissue−cultured grape plants to ensure consistency of plant material for investigating the whole−plant level.

tolerances to individual and combined stresses
v. amurensis is one of the most cold–tolerant species in the vitis genus  <cit> ; our present study confirmed this finding based on the lower lt <dig> value obtained . v. amurensis also exhibits better drought tolerance caused by less membrane damage and water loss. to our knowledge, the comparison between the drought tolerance of v. amurensis with other grapes has been rarely reported  <cit> , the result of which may broaden our understanding on the use of this genotype for evaluating combined stress. the combined stress was investigated under two different cooling modes with 6% peg solution. el assays showed that v. amurensis had significantly lower lt <dig> values than ‘muscat hamburg’ under both modes . this finding indicates that v. amurensis had high tolerance to drought–cold stress. remarkably, the lt <dig> values between v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg’ were similar under both cooling modes . thus, this evaluation method could significantly distinguish the tolerance of the two genotypes to the combined stress condition. the lt <dig> values of both genotypes under the combined stress were higher than the values under individual cold stress . this result could be attributed to increased stress effect by drought stress. adding peg to induce drought stress might damage membrane stability, as indicated by the increasing lt <dig> values.

to determine the effects of the two different cooling modes combined with a fixed peg concentration of 6%, we emphasized the relationship between el and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements  under both cooling modes. fv/fo and fv/fm exhibited significant higher correlations with el under gc mode than those under naf mode, indicating that gc mode was more suitable than naf mode for drought−cold treatment. the changed trends of chlorophyll fluorescence data under two modes were similar , so the correlation differences possibly originated from the el measurement results. this finding could be attributed to the insufficient time for increasing membrane damage within short−term freezing at defined temperature without pre−chilling accumulation; hence, el did not exhibit a “steep−rise” at one inflection point under naf mode, as opposed to that under gc mode. under field conditions, the chilling temperatures in winter routinely and gradually decrease; therefore, gc mode could better mimic the natural environment than naf mode. indeed, an exponential decay regression might be better for correlating fv/fm and fv/fo to el, particularly under the mode naf . however, the correlation fv/fm and el under gc is clearly linear and an exponential decay regression may cause overfitting. therefore, the linear regression was applied for all the correlations, which highlight the differences between the two cooling modes and provide support for better choice of gc mode.

in this study, we selected the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters from three designated indexes. other parameters , effective photochemical quantum yield of ps ii, , and stern-volmer type non-photochemical fluorescence quenching ) measured using chlorophyll fluorescence could also be used for model establishment  <cit> . however, compared with other parameters, the three candidate indexes could be easily obtained after dark adaptation without requiring actinic light adaption or far−red light illumination. using these three parameters could provide a more convenient process that is not destructive to the leaf samples, and thus, is more advantageous for large−scale grapevine production and resistant breeding.

there are few points on all correlations of figure  <dig> between 20% and 60% el. this lack of evenly scattered points between 20% and 60% el was a result of the sharp burst of cell damage occurred between − <dig> to −5°c . some suggestions to improve the system accuracy include to take an even smaller temperature decreasing gradient, e.g. changing from 1°c/h to  <dig> °c/h between − <dig> to −6°c in gc mode. however, this will not only double the number of measurements but also challenge the accuracy of the cooling instruments. consequently, the balance between the gain of accuracy and increase of manpower needs to be checked when applying the updated system to large scale drought−cold tolerance screening at population or germplasm level.

fv/fm is one of the most commonly used indexes for tolerance evaluation. however, using fv/fm mainly focuses on the tolerance to individual stress, such as pathogen  <cit> , drought  <cit> , freezing  <cit> , and heat  <cit> . some previous studies have reported that water deficit minimally affects fv/fm  <cit> ; however, our preliminary experiments showed that fv/fm, as well as fv/fo, qp, and ϕpsii, significantly decreased under individual drought stress . the discrepancies in these studies could be attributed to the different growth conditions of the plant; the plants in the hydroponic system are more sensitive to drought than those grown in soil. the possible reason is the water potential may gradually decrease in soil dry, while the plants suffer from continuous given low water potential stress in the peg−added hydroponic system during the whole treatment process, which leads to more rapid and severe damages in electron transport chains. moreover, the findings suggest that the experimental system used in the present study could ensure that drought and cold stress, which were used as combined stress, individually affected the chlorophyll fluorescence results.

lt <dig> estimation based on chlorophyll fluorescence parameter
the lt <dig> value is an easily comparable parameter for quantifying tolerance to drought and cold stresses  <cit> . however, classic lt <dig> calculation by measuring el is time consuming and less accurate, and thus, unsuitable for large−scale screenings of drought−or cold−tolerant grapes. hence, we established a suitable model to estimate the lt <dig> values without el measurement. determining chlorophyll fluorescence is a good alternative for el measurement because of its non−invasiveness and rapidness, as well as its potential for estimating lt <dig> according to the high correlations between el and given chlorophyll fluorescence parameters.

this study also reported a significant correlation between lt50–el and lt50–fv/fm across different grape genotypes under simultaneous drought–cold stress; this correlation is beneficial for estimating lt <dig> without el measurement. moreover, investigating two markedly resistance−different genotypes, namely, v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg,’ and four genotypes increases the coverage in the spectrum of the natural drought–cold resistance of grapevine. the synchronization between the responses of fv/fm to el under gc mode confirms the reliability of using fv/fm as an effective indicator of drought–cold resistance.

the significant correlation between lt50–el and lt50–fv/fm has been observed under freezing condition in arabidopsis   <cit>  and grape  <cit> . interestingly, ehlert et al.  <cit>  emphasized that lt50–fv/fm is slightly lower than the lt <dig> value in arabidopsis leaves. jiang et al.  <cit>  concluded that the fv/fm inflection point is higher than the lt <dig> of grape woody tissues. in the present study, lt50–el and lt50–fv/fm are approximately equal, which may be due to the different cold sensitivities of plant tissues and the additive effect of drought and cold stresses.

the proposed evaluation system provides a more convenient and reliable tool for determining drought–cold resistance in the laboratory and for large–scale screening in the field. the system should be further improved before use for actual grapevine breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we established and validated a novel experimental system for evaluating the resistance of grapevines against drought–cold stress. this system used tissue−cultured grape plants and 6% peg solution under gc mode to simulate drought–cold stress. the resistance against drought–cold stress was evaluated in six different representative germplasms based on el and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, particularly fv/fm. a high correlation was observed between el and fv/fm. therefore, lt <dig> values can be well calculated based on fv/fm using the present system to evaluate the resistance of grapevine germplasms against drought–cold stress.
