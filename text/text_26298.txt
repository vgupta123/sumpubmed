BACKGROUND
leukocyte recruitment into inflamed tissue is considered a fundamental part of the inflammatory process and therefore plays a crucial role in immune defence. leukocyte recruitment follows a well-defined cascade of events, beginning with the capture of free-flowing leukocytes to the vessel wall, followed by rolling, integrin-mediated firm adhesion to the endothelial layer, postarrest modifications and finally transmigration into tissue  <cit> . firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium crucially depends on the β2-integrins lfa- <dig>  and mac- <dig>  which interact with different endothelial ligands such as icam- <dig> and rage, the receptor for advanced glycation end products  <cit> . deficiency of the β2-integrin cd <dig>  an essential part of both β2-integrins lfa- <dig> and mac- <dig>  leads to severe recurrent acute and chronic infections in mice and humans, which is caused by impaired leukocyte adhesion  <cit> . interestingly, deficiency of either lfa- <dig> or mac- <dig> in mice only mildly affects leukocyte recruitment in vivo indicating overlapping functions of lfa- <dig> and mac- <dig> in mediating firm leukocyte adhesion  <cit> . similarly, icam <dig> knockout mice show only marginal inflammatory defects  <cit> . recently, we demonstrated in a model of acute trauma-induced inflammation in the mouse, that the concomitant absence of icam- <dig> and rage leads to a dramatic decrease in leukocyte adhesion when compared to control mice or mice where only icam- <dig> or rage is absent  <cit> . these findings provide evidence that the integrin ligands icam- <dig> and rage exert overlapping functions  <cit> . at present it is unclear, if the adhesion molecules rage and icam- <dig> cooperate in a similar fashion in other models of inflammation. this prompted us to further dissect the role of icam- <dig> and rage for firm leukocyte adhesion under different inflammatory conditions. using intravital microscopy, we observed leukocyte adhesion in cremaster muscle venules of rage and icam <dig> knockout mice during trauma- or tnf-α-induced inflammation and additional local stimulation with the leukocyte chemoattractant peptide n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine  or systemic injection of the chemokine cxcl <dig>  our findings expand previous reports in as much as they show that besides its overlapping function, icam- <dig> and rage also exhibit distinct and stimulus-dependent functions in mediating leukocyte adhesion in vivo.

RESULTS
leukocyte adhesion in trauma-induced inflammation
during trauma-induced inflammation, which is induced by surgical preparation, firm leukocyte arrest is mostly mediated via the β2-integrins lfa- <dig> and mac- <dig> interacting with icam- <dig> and rage, respectively  <cit> . here, we observed leukocyte adhesion in postcapillary venules of the surgically prepared cremaster muscle of wild type, rage-/- and icam1-/- mice before and during fmlp superfusion. microvascular and hemodynamic parameters were similar between genotypes and treatment groups and there were no significant changes of systemic leukocyte counts during fmlp superfusion . in line with an earlier report  <cit> , leukocyte adhesion in trauma-stimulated cremaster muscle venules was similar in wild type mice, icam1-/- mice and rage-/- mice prior to fmlp superfusion . to explore the contribution of rage and icam- <dig> in mediating firm leukocyte adhesion in response to fmlp, we observed leukocyte adhesion in postcapillary venules of the cremaster muscle during  <dig> min fmlp superfusion. fmlp produced a strong increase in leukocyte adhesion in both rage-/- mice and wild type mice. in contrast, fmlp-stimulated leukocyte adhesion was significantly attenuated in icam1-/- mice suggesting that fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in surgically prepared cremaster muscle venules is dependent on icam- <dig>  but independent of rage .

role of mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> for leukocyte adhesion in fmlp-stimulated trauma-induced inflammation
to further dissect the role of β2-integrins for fmlp-stimulated leukocyte adhesion, we investigated fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in exteriorized cremaster muscle venules of wild type and rage-/- mice pretreated with blocking mabs against the β2-integrins mac- <dig> or lfa- <dig> using anti mac- <dig> mab tib <dig>  and anti lfa- <dig> mab tib <dig> , respectively. to rule out unspecific effects of the antibodies we injected wild type mice with respective isotype control antibodies. it is important to mention, that we injected all antibodies immediately before fmlp superfusion to identify the role of β2-integrins for fmlp induced leukocyte adhesion only. hemodynamic and microvascular parameters did not vary significantly between the different groups . before fmlp superfusion leukocyte adhesion was similar in trauma-stimulated cremaster muscle venules of wild type mice and rage-/- mice in response to different antibody treatment . this is an expected finding due to the fact that antibodies were injected after induction of trauma. the fmlp-induced increase of leukocyte adhesion  in wild type or rage-/- mice was not affected by pretreatment with mac-1-blocking mabtib <dig>  however, fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion was almost absent in wild type mice or rage-/- mice pretreated with lfa-1-blocking mab tib <dig>  suggesting that fmlp-stimulated adhesion is dependent on lfa- <dig> and icam- <dig> but independent of rage and mac- <dig> 

leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-induced inflammation
leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-stimulated cremaster muscle venules was observed by intravital microscopy in six wild type mice, five rage-/- mice, and four icam1-/- mice. hemodynamic and microvascular parameters did not vary significantly between the different groups . as described earlier, leukocyte adhesion was significantly reduced in rage-/- mice compared to wild type mice or icam1-/- mice prior to fmlp superfusion . since fmlp is known to trigger leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-induced inflammation independent of icam- <dig>  <cit> , we wanted to test if fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-treated cremaster muscle venules is dependent on rage. similar to the report by foy and ley  <cit> , we observed an increase in leukocyte adhesion during five minutes of fmlp-superfusion in tnf-α-treated cremaster muscle venules of icam1-/- mice and wild type mice. however, there was no fmlp-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion in rage-/- mice , suggesting that leukocyte adhesion is independent of icam- <dig>  but dependent on rage in this setting.

role of mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> for fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-stimulated-cremaster muscle venules
to further explore the adhesion molecules involved in fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion of tnf-α-stimulated cremaster muscle venules, we investigated fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-treated cremaster muscle venules using blocking mabs against mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig>  to rule out unspecific effects of the antibodies, we injected wild type mice with respective isotype control antibodies. in parallel to the trauma model, we injected all antibodies immediately before fmlp superfusion to identify the role of β2-integrins for fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion only. hemodynamic and microvascular parameters were similar between the different groups . as expected in this setting, before fmlp superfusion leukocyte adhesion was similar in tnf-α-stimulated cremaster muscle venules of wild type mice and icam1-/- mice in the different treatment groups . five minutes after fmlp superfusion the fmlp-induced increase of leukocyte adhesion was absent in wild type treated with the mac-1-blocking mab tib <dig> shortly before fmlp superfusion . in contrast, in wild type mice treatment with lfa-1-blocking antibody tib <dig> did not alter fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion compared to wild type mice without antibody treatment, suggesting that fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in this setting is mostly dependent on mac- <dig> but not lfa- <dig>  accordingly, treatment of icam1-/- mice with mac-1-blocking mab tib <dig> abolished fmlp-triggered leukocyte adhesion, while the absence of icam- <dig>  did not influence the fmlp-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion . these findings suggest that fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-treated cremaster muscle venules is dependent on rage and mac- <dig>  whereas icam- <dig> and lfa- <dig> are not required.

leukocyte adhesion following systemic stimulation by chemokine cxcl <dig> in trauma-induced inflammation
to investigate a potential role of rage, icam- <dig> or lfa- <dig> in chemokine-induced firm leukocyte arrest in vivo, we systemically injected the cxcr <dig> chemokine cxcl <dig>  into rage-/- and icam1-/- mice, and into wild type mice with and without anti-lfa-1-blocking or isotype control antibody pretreatment. systemic injection of cxcl <dig> has been shown to induce firm leukocyte adhesion in exteriorized cremaster muscle venules of wild type mice  <cit> . hemodynamic and microvascular parameters were similar between the different groups . following systemic injection of cxcl <dig>  we observed a significant increase in the number of adherent cells in wild type mice . similarly, in rage-deficient mice the number of adherent cells significantly increased five minutes after cxcl <dig> injection , suggesting that cxcl-1-triggered activation of β2-integrins leading to firm leukocyte arrest does not require rage. in contrast, in icam1-/- mice, systemic injection of cxcl <dig> did not lead to an increase in leukocyte adhesion  indicating that cxcl1-triggered leukocyte arrest is strongly dependent on icam- <dig>  furthermore, pretreatment of wild type mice with the anti-lfa-1-blocking antibody tib  <dig>  but not its isotype control antibody, inhibited cxcl1-induced leukocyte arrest, suggesting that lfa- <dig> and icam- <dig> play a predominant role in mediating cxcl1-triggered leukocyte arrest during trauma-induced inflammation in vivo.

stimulus-dependent expression of adhesion molecules in cremaster muscle venules
next, we addressed the question whether the stimulus-dependent role of icam-1-lfa vs. rage-mac- <dig> for leukocyte adhesion is due to altered endothelial expression of adhesion molecules. immunohistochemistry was used to assess endothelial expression of icam- <dig> and rage in postcapillary venules of cremaster muscles obtained from wild type mice either directly postmortem , after exteriorization and superfusion  or after  <dig> h of tnf-α-stimulation followed by surgical preparation . while we found no rage expression on the endothelium of unstimulated cremaster muscle venules of wild type mice , after trauma and even more pronounced during tnf-α-induced inflammation, rage expression could be clearly detected . as illustrated in figure 6b, d, f, we found endothelial surface expression of icam- <dig> in unstimulated, trauma- and tnf-α stimulated cremaster muscle venules.

beside representative micrographs, the immunostaining were scored semi-quantitatively to compare endothelial expression of rage to icam- <dig> between the inflammatory models . during trauma-induced inflammation we found a moderate expression of rage, which was slightly below that of icam- <dig> resulting in a rage/icam- <dig> expression ratio of  <dig> . tnf-α-stimulation produced a significant upregulation of both rage and icam- <dig> compared to trauma-induced inflammation. however, the increase of rage expression was stronger than for icam- <dig>  which is reflected by a rage/icam- <dig> expression ratio of  <dig>  indicating that expression of rage is more strongly inducible by inflammatory stimulation than expression of icam- <dig> 

stimulus-dependent expression of lfa- <dig> and mac-1
to further explore underlying mechanisms, we investigated mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> expression on isolated wild type neutrophils pretreated with tnf-α, fmlp, or cxcl <dig> using flow cytometry. lfa- <dig> expression on wild type neutrophils was strongly upregulated after fmlp and cxcl- <dig> treatment compared to baseline expression . however, neutrophils pretreated with tnf-α followed by fmlp treatment only showed a mild increase in lfa- <dig> expression . in contrast, expression of mac- <dig> was only mildly increased in response to fmlp or cxcl- <dig>  but increased strongly upon stimulation with tnf-α and fmlp when compared to unstimulated neutrophils . these results demonstrate that lfa- <dig> and mac- <dig> expression are differentially affected by the various stimuli which is in line with the in vivo results shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts rage belongs to the pattern recognition receptors and exerts its central function during acute and chronic inflammations not only as a strong activator of the proinflammatory transcription factor nf-κb but also as endothelial-expressed ligand for the β2-integrin mac- <dig>  <cit> . the biological relevance of rage as a ligand for mac- <dig> has been recently demonstrated in rage-/- × icam1-/- mice where leukocyte adhesion was almost completely absent in an acute surgically-induced model of inflammation in the cremaster muscle in vivo  <cit>  suggesting that rage and icam- <dig> cooperate closely in mediating firm leukocyte adhesion, with rage interacting with mac- <dig> and icam- <dig> binding to lfa- <dig>  interestingly, the same study revealed that under circumstances where inflammation was induced by local treatment with tnf-α plus the surgical trauma, leukocyte adhesion was only mildly reduced in the absence of rage and icam- <dig> suggesting that alternative, yet unknown integrin ligands exist and that the close cooperation of rage and icam- <dig> as β2-integrin ligands is stimulus-dependent   <cit> . to further investigate the role of rage as mac- <dig> ligand during leukocyte recruitment, we studied here leukocyte adhesion in cremaster muscles of rage-/-, icam1-/- and wild type mice using different inflammatory models in the cremaster muscle. we show that additional fmlp stimulation during trauma-induced inflammation leads to increased leukocyte adhesion which is independent of rage but dependent on icam- <dig>  while fmlp superfusion in tnf-α pretreated cremaster muscle venules induces rage-dependent adhesion which was independent of icam- <dig> . additional studies using mabs against mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> confirmed that rage interacts with mac- <dig> and icam- <dig> with lfa- <dig>  respectively. these findings imply that the same pro-inflammatory agent  can lead to different biological effects. this is also supported by an earlier report from foy and ley  <cit>  showing that fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion in vivo is only dependent on icam- <dig> in exteriorized cremaster muscles without any other stimulus while additional prestimulation with tnf-α leads to an icam-1-independent increase in leukocyte adhesion following fmlp superfusion  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms responsible for the differential and stimulus-dependent regulation of β2-integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion are currently unclear.

on the endothelial side, our immunohistochemical findings showed a stimulus-dependent expression of icam- <dig> and rage. during trauma-induced inflammation, endothelial rage expression was less than icam- <dig> expression, while after tnf-α treatment rage expression on the inflamed endothelium was slightly higher than icam- <dig> expression. however, these subtle differences in expression might not explain, why fmlp-induced leukocyte adhesion relies on lfa-1/icam- <dig> during trauma-induced inflammation and on mac-1/rage during tnf-α-stimulated inflammation.

in contrast, our flow cytometric analysis on the expression of mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> showed that lfa- <dig> expression on wild type neutrophils was profoundly increased after cxcl <dig> or fmlp treatment, while pretreatment with tnf-α followed by fmlp did not alter lfa- <dig> expression. inversely, mac- <dig> upregulation was most prominent on tnf-α plus fmlp treated neutrophils in comparison to cxcl <dig> or fmlp treatment alone. these findings are in line with our in vivo findings and also to previous observations showing that tnf-α induces mac- <dig>  but not lfa- <dig> expression on neutrophils  <cit> .

besides these more quantitative changes in the expression of mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> on pmn, additional mechanisms could lie in qualitative changes, i.e. in a stimulus-dependent activation of β2-integrins differing between mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig>  <cit> . our group recently showed that icam- <dig> binding to lfa- <dig>  mediates firm leukocyte adhesion in inflamed cremaster muscle venules, whereas leukocyte crawling in the same setting is dependent on interactions between icam- <dig> and mac- <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that during firm leukocyte arrest, different activation signals are necessary to enable interactions between lfa- <dig> and icam- <dig> or mac- <dig> and icam- <dig>  indeed, different mechanisms of mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> activation are reported. fagerholm and colleagues found that icam- <dig> binding to mac- <dig> in neutrophils is regulated by α-chain phosphorylation of mac- <dig>  <cit> . as chatila et al. demonstrated in an earlier study that fmlp treatment of unstimulated pmn did not affect α-chain phosphorylation of mac- <dig>  <cit> , this might explain why mac- <dig> does not significantly contribute to fmlp-triggered adhesion during trauma-induced inflammation. noteworthy, lfa- <dig> and mac- <dig> also differ in their binding site on icam- <dig>  while lfa- <dig> uses the d <dig> domain on icam- <dig> for binding, mac- <dig> recognizes the d <dig> domain on icam- <dig>  <cit> .

finally, posttranslational glycosylation has been reported as an important regulatory mechanism for leukocyte arrest and integrin-dependent adhesion  <cit> . for the β2-integrin mac- <dig>  feng et al. demonstrated recently that activation of endogenous pmn sialidase leads to desialylation of mac- <dig> with a subsequent increase in leukocyte adhesion  <cit> . the authors explained their findings by a better exposure of the activation epitope on mac- <dig> upon desialylation of crucial sialic acid residues on mac- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence that rage is a relevant, but context-dependent mac- <dig> ligand during inflammation in vivo. in addition, the presented findings expand our view of the complex and stimulus-dependent regulation of leukocyte adhesion during inflammation , which might lead to new rage-based strategies to specifically interfere with the recruitment of immune cells during specific acute and chronic inflammatory conditions.
