BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rna molecules of approximately  <dig> nucleotides in length, which play important regulatory roles in animals and plants  <cit> . mirnas have been found to down-regulate the expression of target genes by binding to the complementary sites in transcripts and causing translational repression or transcript degradation  <cit> . numerous biological processes in animal development, apoptosis, fat metabolism and hematopoietic differentiation have been reported to be regulated by mirnas  <cit> . in addition, recent studies have revealed that mirnas can increase protein translation by binding to complementary promoter sequences, extending the important function of mirna to protein expression  <cit> .

many experimental techniques and computational methods have been developed to identify mirnas  <cit> ; and a large number of mirnas have been identified in primates, rodents, birds, fish and plants  <cit> . however, the number of mirnas from bovine species is limited with only  <dig> reported , comparing with  <dig> from human and  <dig> from mouse. early studies suggested that most mirnas are conserved among related species  <cit> . however, recent studies have shown that many newly identified mirnas are species specific  <cit> , and the expression of mirnas is not strictly conserved among species  <cit> . although many mirnas are known to be differentially expressed during development and across tissue types  <cit> , little is known about the relative abundance and specificity of expression patterns among tissues for most bovine mirnas. in this study, we profiled bovine mirnas and evaluated their expression patterns from  <dig> beef cattle tissues including muscle, kidney, liver, spleen, thymus, three fat tissues and three brain tissues. elucidation of the expression patterns of different mirnas among different tissues will contribute to the understanding of the roles of mirnas in gene expression regulatory networks for particular biological functions in livestock species.

RESULTS
identification of mirnas and novel mirna candidates
from  <dig> small rna libraries,  <dig>  clones were sequenced and  <dig>  small rna sequences were obtained with  <dig>  to  <dig>  small rna sequences covered from each library. among the total of  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  sequences were classified as previously reported bovine mirnas,  <dig>  sequences were orthologs of known mirnas from other mammalian species, and  <dig> sequences were novel mirna candidates. the rest sequences were found to be other small non-coding rna, mrna, trna or rrna, etc. .

eleven tissues from beef cattle were used for libraries construction. library was named as abbreviated tissue name .

in total, we identified  <dig> previously reported bovine mirnas and  <dig> orthologs of known mirnas from other mammalian species, which are predicted to be encoded by  <dig> different mirna genes . in all libraries but longissimus dorsi muscle  library, the previously reported bovine mirna sequences represented ~75% to 95% of the total sequences of each library. nine out of  <dig> known bovine mirnas and  <dig> out of  <dig> orthologous mirnas were found to be present only once in the total sequenced clones . orthologs of known mirnas sequences from ldm library accounted for approximately one third of all orthologous mirnas . two orthologous mirnas  were detected more than two times and in at least two different tissues but were not mapped to the bovine genome  . all but two of the bovine orthologous mirnas had orthologs in human species. these two mirnas were found to be produced from different arms of the same pre-mirna  and conserved in platypus and horse . in addition, we identified  <dig> novel mirna candidates with  <dig> of them found to be present only once in all sequenced clones .

cconservation of bovine mirna candidates was evaluated in human , mouse , and rat , dog , horse , chicken  genomes.]

*indicating that the precursor of mirna candidate was reported in bovine and other species as well as the other arm of the precursor was reported as mirna.

to investigate evolutionary conservation of these mirna candidates, six vertebrate genomes including human, mouse, rat, dog, horse and chicken were taken into account. twelve out of  <dig> mirna candidates were found to be conserved in at least one of these species. three mirna candidates  were identified in the 5' arm of bta-mir- <dig>  - <dig> and -487a, respectively, while only the 3' arms of these mirnas were reported in several species .

microrna genes
a total of  <dig> genes encoding the identified bovine mirnas were predicted using reported bovine mirnas from mirbase  <dig>  and the identified bovine orthologs of other mammalian mirnas. of these,  <dig> were reported in mirbase ;  <dig> mirna precursors were not reported in mirbase database previously;  <dig> were detected based on the orthologous mirnas . more than  <dig> bovine mirnas were found to be encoded from more than one predicted hairpin precursor.

when the bovine mirnas were compared to those from human, mouse and rat, most bovine mature mirnas were also reported in the other three mammalian species. this agreed with that many mirnas are conserved  <cit>  among mammalian species. most of the conserved mirnas in the four species were also found to have the same number of precursor although they were encoded by multi-copies of genes , indicating that the processing of these mirnas has been conserved among these species.

sequence variations and end variants in mature mirna sequences
approximately 20% of the identified mirna sequence were found to have mismatches with the bovine genome that were caused by post-transcriptional modification, and/or rt-pcr, and sequencing errors . the prevailing sequence alterations such as 3' terminal a or u additions and a-to-g transitions could result from post-transcriptional modification as previously reported by landgraf  <cit> . a-to-g transitions potentially caused by a-to-i editing were mainly identified in mir-99a and mir-376c , which have been reported to undergo a-to-i editing in human and mouse, respectively  <cit> .

it has been reported that a variant of end  different sirnas or mirnas could be generated during dicer processing of double-stranded rna , short hairpin rna  and mirna precursors in vitro  <cit> . alignment of the identified sequences revealed that end variants were present in most mirnas, showing that many mirnas sequenced more than two times had end variants that were apparently generated from the same precursor . most end variants differed at the 3' end nucleotide and a small percentage of them differed at the 5' end. the finding of the variant mirna sequences is consistent with previous large scale mirna profiling studies  <cit> . more than  <dig> bovine mirnas reported in mirbase were one or two nucleotides shorter at the 3' end comparing to ours, for example, bta-mir-18a and bta-mir-16b .

analysis of mirna expression in bovine tissues
hierarchical clustering of  <dig> bovine tissues based on the relative cloning frequencies of mirnas showed that mirna expression was similar in the related tissues such as abdominal subcutaneous fat and rump subcutaneous fat, while different tissues had diverse expression profiles . comparison of mirna expression profiles among tissues revealed that very few mirnas expression was tissue specific . several mirnas were found to be highly expressed in particular tissues: mir- <dig>  - <dig>  and -129-2-3p in brain tissues, mir-30a, -30e, -30d, -200a and -200b in kidney, mir- <dig> in liver, mir- <dig> in spleen, mir- <dig> in spleen and thymus, mir-193b, - <dig> in ldm muscle. in contrast,  <dig> mirnas were identified in all tissues and several of them  were expressed at high levels in all tissues. another  <dig> mirnas were found in  <dig> or more tissues. the five most abundant mirnas across the  <dig> tissues were mir-23a, -23b, -99a, -125b and -126-5p, accounting for  <dig> % of all small rna sequences .

to validate above mirna expression patterns, quantitative rt-pcr was performed on tissue-specific mirnas , high cloning frequency mirnas  and low cloning frequency mirnas . two animals were tested for each tissue and similar rt-pcr results were obtained from both animals . the expression profiles of the  <dig> mirnas across  <dig> tissues confirmed that mir-26a and -99a expressed at high levels in all tissues, while mir- <dig> and -133a exclusively expressed in liver and muscle, respectively. four bovine mirnas  were expressed at low levels in all tissue . the qrt-pcr data showed similar expression trend of detected expression of these mirnas from the library except mir- <dig> 

discussion
mirna expression patterns in different tissues have been profiled in several vertebrates  <cit> . although there were diverse expression profiles in different tissues, most mirnas were ubiquitously expressed. our comparison of mirna expression across  <dig> tissues from bovine revealed a few tissue specific mirnas: mir- <dig>  - <dig> in brain, mir- <dig> in liver, mir- <dig>  mir-133a and - <dig> in muscle, which had been previously reported in mouse and human  <cit> . brain and muscle tissues have much more specific or enriched mirnas than other tissues especially fat tissues, indicating that these mirnas may play important regulatory roles in these tissues.

mirnas may be gained or lost during evolution, however, many mirnas are conserved  <cit> . identification of common mirna precursors between bovine and other three mammalian species  suggests these mirnas may have similar roles as those in other species since these conserved mirna have higher expression levels  <cit> . the higher expression level of three conserved mirnas  in all tested bovine tissues suggest that these mirna may be more relevant to the highly conserved biological process in mammalians. further study to discover their regulatory functions are needed. recent developed hhigh-throughput sequencing analysis has allowed the identification of an increasing number of species-specific mirnas  <cit>  since these mirna may play a role in host-specific biological process. most of the mirna candidates identified in this study were bovine specific, although their expression was less than 1% comparing the total sequenced clones, suggesting further studies using deep-sequencing technologies  <cit>  or specialized small rna isolation and cloning procedures  <cit>  may help to identify and understand the functions of species specific mirnas.

mirnas are firstly transcribed as pri-mirnas and gave rise to short, 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures  by the drosha-dgcr <dig> complex  <cit> . the hairpin structures are then processed by dicer. during the process, both strands of a mirna precursor can form functional mirnas. however, most of the time only one arm becomes the mature mirna or predominant mirna, while the other degrades or generates star mirna. khvorova et al  <cit>  suggested that the arm with lower thermodynamic stability at its 5' end becomes the mature mirna. in this study, we identified  <dig> pairs of bovine mirnas and star mirnas. the stability of the initial four base pairs of these mirna pairs were calculated using nearest-neighbour method and 2-state hybridization algorithm  <cit> . sixty percent of bovine mirnas  displayed strand bias . we also calculated the stability of human mirnas and star mirnas from mirbase  <dig>  using the same method. in total,  <dig> pairs of mirnas and star mirnas were taken into account and  <dig> pairs of them were excluded from evaluation. interestingly, only 60%  of human mirnas exhibit strand bias, too . we argue that there must be additional important factors other than internal stability to determine which arm of the mirna precursor becomes the mature mirna or mirna* since the following observations can not be explained:  most mirnas observed in this study had a variant of isoforms generated by dicer and a few of the 5' end variants even processed by drosha .  some conserved pre-mirnas express different mature mirnas or star mirnas depending on the species. for example, the stem-loop sequence of bta-mir- <dig> was perfectly matched to those from human, mouse and rat; however, in cattle and mouse, both strands were observed as mature mirnas, while in human and rat, one strand generates mirna and the other strand generates mirna*.  some mature mirnas from the same precursors reverse to star mirnas or vice versa in different tissues or development stage  <cit> .

in addition, to understand the roles of mirna, we mapped and identified chromosome-x related mirna. we identified five to seven mirna clusters containing ~ <dig> common mirnas in bovine, mouse and human, respectively. cluster  <dig> and the sequences of corresponding orthologs of these mirnas were not found in mouse genome. we conjectured this cluster should be on some gap of chr.x in mouse. two mirna clusters  in bovine were not found on the x-chromosome but were found on the contig un. <dig>  . interestingly, another common mirna  was not mapped to the bovine genome but was also identified in the x-chromosome of human and mouse . we speculate that contig un. <dig>  and bta-mir- <dig> belong to chromosome-x. the identification of mirna and mirna clusters on chromosome-x reveals that some mirnas are conserved even in genome location between species. the blast search of the mirnas on the bovine genome identified a third precursor, which was a perfect match with bta-mir-138- <dig> in contig un. <dig> . however, only two precursors of mir- <dig> were found in human, rat and mouse. conserved number copy of mirna genes between species suggests that bta-mir-138- <dig> is the same as bta-mir-138- <dig> and contig un. <dig>  may belong to chromosome  <dig>  therefore, mirnas and their clustering appearance maybe provide potential molecular markers for evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
our small-rna cloning and sequencing approach was efficiently target mature mirnas. however, to identify and understand the functions of bovine mirnas, further studies using deep-sequencing technologies are required. the mirna expression patterns among  <dig> tissues in beef cattle showed most mirnas are ubiquitously expressed, suggesting that these mirnas may play a role in a broad range of biological processes in various tissues. although mature mirnas have been reported to display strand bias, the mechanism which arm of pre-mirna dominates still need further study. most identified bovine mirnas were found in other three mammalian species and are highly conserved during evolution, suggesting that these mirnas may have similar function in mammalian species and can be potential molecular markers for evolution.
