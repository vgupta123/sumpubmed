BACKGROUND
a mathematical model to understand, predict, control, or even design a real biological system is a central theme in systems biology. the most often used mathematical models for dynamic biological systems are formulated as nonlinear ordinary differential equations . the critical challenges to get an ode model are structure identification and parameter estimation of the model. to identify the structure and parameters of a dynamic model, the most important and essential job is to find the solution of odes efficiently and accurately. this job can be treated by analytical and numerical methods. analytical methods are limited to certain special forms of odes, but numerical methods have no such limitations. there are several numerical methods can be used to solve odes  <cit> , e.g., taylor-series methods, modified euler methods, and runge-kutta methods with variable step size control. the taylor-series method takes more computation time to solve odes if the various derivatives are complicated, and the error is difficult to determine for arbitrary functions. the modified euler method is a special case of a second-order runge-kutta method, and is more efficient compared to the taylor-series method  <cit> . fourth-order runge-kutta method is the most widely used ode solver to meet requirements on both efficiency and accuracy. collocation methods  <cit>  are another common algorithms for solving odes and have been used for more than forty years. wang  <cit>  proposed a modified collocation method to transform odes into algebraic equations, and solved them by the newton-raphson method or an iteration method with step length restriction. the restricted step size is fixed and computed by trial and error. to overcome this drawback, we propose an adaptive step size control approach based on the banach fixed point theorem for the modified collocation method in this paper.

there are different types of gains and dynamic sensitivities defined for sensitivity analysis  <cit> . the relative change of a dependent variable in response to a relative change in an independent variable is called a logarithmic gain, or a log gain. log gains describe the change of dependent variables due to an environment change and are very useful for the assessment of the robustness and parameter estimation of a model. the change of a dependent variable in response to a change in a parameter is called a parameter sensitivity. in contrast to log gains, parameter sensitivities are the change of dependent variables correspond to a structure change in the model. the biochemical systems theory   <cit>  and metabolic control analysis   <cit>  have achieved a great success in addressing the sensitivities at a steady state. however, the transient or periodic behavior is the primary interest in many systems . in these systems, the parameter sensitivities and log gains change with time, therefore the calculation methods for the steady state responses can not function. dynamic sensitivity analysis is used in studying time-varying sensitivities in dynamic biological systems. a dynamic biological system can be characterized using logarithmic gains, sensitivities with respect to parameters and initial conditions. several methods have been published to evaluate dynamic sensitivities  <cit> . they can be divided into the indirect methods  and the direct methods . in the idms, the value of one dedicated parameter is varied infinitesimally while the values of other parameters are fixed. the model equations are solved anew for these sets of values of the parameters that differ in the value of the dedicated parameter only. the sensitivity of each variable with respect to this dedicated parameter is computed using the difference between the solutions of that variable for the two sets of values of the parameters divided by the infinitesimal difference of the dedicated parameter. in the dms, using an ode solver to solve the model equations and sensitivity equations simultaneously is the most used method for computing dynamic sensitivities. shiraishi et al.  <cit>  published a variable-order, variable-step taylor-series method that can be used as an ode solver providing a highly accurate calculation to compute dynamic sensitivities. this method is limited to general mass action  models described by power-law differential equations. runge-kutta methods with variable step size control can be used to compute dynamic sensitivities for most of the nonlinear differential equations, but is inefficient to determine the step size in a large dimensional system including the model differential equations and sensitivity differential equations. due to the efficiency, dunker  <cit>  proposed the decoupled direct method , in which the sensitivity equations are solved separately from the model equations. he said: "the decoupled method has advantages in simplicity, stability, accuracy, efficiency, storage requirements, and program size over other methods". although the ddm approach has so many advantages, the step size for the time profile determined by the error control of model equations is unable to be used for the sensitivities when the sensitivity equations are more stiff than the model equations and will generate inaccurate results.

dynamic sensitivity analysis evaluates the influences on dependent variables due to variations of parameters, initial conditions and independent variables. in many practical applications, e.g., the fed-batch fermentation systems, the system admissible input  can be time-dependent. the main difficulty for investigating the dynamic log gains of these systems is the infinite dimension due to the time-dependent input. shiraishi et al.  <cit>  proposed an efficient method, based on a combination of the recasting technique and the taylor-series method, for calculating the time courses of log gains to investigate the dynamic behavior of log gains for oscillation models with a limit cycle. the method is limited to the computations of dynamic log gains with respect to constant independent variables. we extend the computations of dynamic log gains to a model with continuous time-varying admissible input based on the finite parameterization method . the classical pm was created for numerical solutions of optimal control problems  <cit> . the central idea of the method relies on a simple approximation mechanism. the whole time domain of a continuous admissible input is partitioned into several subintervals, and the input for each subinterval is approximated by a piecewise constant function. the dynamic log gains with respect to the continuous admissible input can be computed based on the partial derivations of dependent variables with respect to the piecewise constant input  <cit> .

in this paper, we present an algorithm with an adaptive step size control that can be used for computing the solution and dynamic sensitivities of an autonomous ode system simultaneously. this algorithm is the modified collocation method, proposed by wang  <cit> , with an adaptive step size control approach. although our algorithm is one of the decouple direct methods in computing dynamic sensitivities of an ode system, the step size determined by model equations can be used on the computations of the time profile and dynamic sensitivities with moderate accuracy even when sensitivity equations are more stiff than model equations. in the algorithm, the modified collocation method is used to transform model and sensitivity equations into algebraic equations, and the approximated solution is solved by an iteration method. this algorithm can be extended easily to solve problems of mixed differential and algebraic equations  by combing algebraic equations with that transferred from differential equations. in our algorithm for computing dynamic sensitivities of an ode system, the model equations and sensitivity equations are solved alternatively in two stages. first, the model equations are advanced from t
               i 
            to t
               i 
            + η using the iteration method, where η is the step size decided by model equations based on the fixed-point theorem. second, the solution of model equations at t
               i 
            + η and the same step size are used to propagate the sensitivity equations from t
               i 
            to t
               i 
            + η. for dynamic systems with continuous time-dependent admissible input, the dynamic log gains are computed based on the parameterization techniques. the pm is used to approximate the original infinite-dimensional problem by a finite dimensional one with piecewise constant input. the dynamic log gain for this approximation problem is defined as the percentage change of a dependent variable in response to an infinitesimal percentage change for each piecewise constant input.

to show this algorithm can perform dynamic sensitivity analysis on very stiff ode systems with moderate accuracy, it is implemented and applied to two sets of chemical reactions: pyrolysis of ethane and oxidation of formaldehyde. the accuracy of this algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the dynamic parameter sensitivities from this new method and that from the direct method with rosenbrock stiff integrator based on the indirect method. the same dynamic sensitivity analysis is performed on an ethanol fed-batch fermentation system with a time-varying feed rate to evaluate the applicability of the algorithm to realistic models with time-dependent admissible input.

ethanol fed-batch fermentation
the dynamic sensitivity analysis of an ethanol fed-batch fermentation process, a real dynamic biological system never reaching a steady state, is used to elucidate the applicability of our algorithm. wang et al.  <cit>  built a mathematical kinetic model of fermentation for ethanol and glycerol production using saccharomyces diastaticus lorre  <dig>  which is a high ethanol tolerance yeast. the mathematical kinetic model for the fed-batch process consists of the dynamic behavior of biomass, glucose, ethanol and glycerol, and its dynamic mass balance equations are expressed as follows:

 dxdτ=tf,dsdτ=tf,dp1dτ=tf,dp2dτ=tf,dvdτ=tff, 

where x is the concentration of cell mass, s is the concentration of glucose, p <dig> is the concentration of ethanol, p <dig> is the concentration of glycerol, v is the working volume of the fermenter, t
                  f 
               is the final fermentation time, τ = t/t
                  f 
               is the normalized fermentation time, s
                  f 
               is the feed concentration of glucose, f is the feed rate, yp1/s is the ethanol yield factor, and yp2/s is the glycerol yield factor. the unstructured kinetic models for the specific cell growth and product formation are respectively expressed as follows:

 μ=μmsks+s+s2/ksikp1kp1+p1+p12/kp1ikp2kp2+p2+p22/kp2i,qp1=νp1sk′s+s+s2/k′sik′p1k′p1+p1+p12/kp′1i,qp2=νp2sk″s+s+s2/k″sik′p2k′p2+p2+p22/k′p2i. 

using a batch fermentation model, wang et al. obtained the optimal values of  <dig> parameters  <cit> . the initial and feed concentrations of glucose are set to  <dig> and  <dig> g/l, the initial concentration of biomass is set to  <dig> g/l, and the starting working volume is set to  <dig>  l in the computations of optimal feed rate and optimal fermentation time to maximize the ethanol production rate j = p1v/t
                  f 
               under some physical constraints, e.g., the residual glucose restriction s ≤ s
                  r 
               for reducing the separation cost, s
                  r 
               is the concentration of the desired residual glucose. the optimal final fermentation time is  <dig>  hours and the optimal feed rate f* for the fed-batch fermentation model  <cit>  is as follows:

  f∗={ <dig> for 0≤τ≤ <dig> .8067for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .5567for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .3067for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .0557for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .3687×10−18for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .2749×10−18for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .0for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .0for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> .1883×10−20for  <dig> <τ≤ <dig> 

our algorithm is applied to the ethanol fed-batch fermentation model using the initial conditions as described above. all dynamic sensitivities with respect to  <dig> parameters  and initial conditions, and the dynamic log gains with respect to time-varying feed rate are computed simultaneously without any difficulty. figure  <dig> shows the dynamic relative sensitivities with respect to μ

                  m 
               is increasing, the rate of consuming glucose is increasing such that the concentration of residue glucose is decreasing. this situation is compatible with the trend in figure  <dig>  the increases in the ethanol and glycerol yield factor cause the increases in the production of ethanol and glycerol, and more glucose remains at the final time. as figures  <dig> and  <dig> show, to increase the production of ethanol and glycerol by improving the ethanol yield factor is better than by increasing the glyverol yield factor. figure  <dig> shows that if the feed concentration of glucose is increasing, the cell growth and the production of ethanol and glycerol are increasing. under this condition, s. diastaticus lorre  <dig> is unable to completely consume glucose to produce ethanol during the fermentation time and more glucose remains at the final time.

                  f 
               causes a low relative increase in the concentration of cell mass and a high relative decrease in the concentration of residue glucose. figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show the dynamic relative sensitivities with respect to the initial conditions x, s, and v. when the initial concentration of cell mass increases, the residue glucose decreases, and the production of ethanol will increase a little, but the production of glycerol will decrease a little at the final fermentation time. starting the fermentation process with more glucose will cause more glucose to remain and the production of ethanol and glycerol to increase a little at the final fermentation time as shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that if the initial working volume is increasing, all concentrations of cell mass, glucose, ethanol, and glycerol are decreasing at the final fermentation time.

                  f 
                are shown in figure  <dig>  to increase j, it is clear that an increase in yp1/s or s
                  f 
               will have more impact than an equal relative increase in yp2/s or μ
                  m
               . the negative value of relative sensitivity for j with respect to t
                  f 
               means a decrease in the fermentation time will get a higher j at the expense of more residual glucose. though the relative sensitivity of j with respect to s
                  f 
               is higher than that with respect to yp1/s at the final fermentation time, by increasing s
                  f 
               to increase j will cause more glucose left at the final time and increase the cost to separate the residue glucose and the ethanol product. we can make a conclusion that to increase j by increasing yp1/s will be a better choice than increasing s
                  f 
               or yp2/s, and decreasing the fermentation time.

the feed rate f of the fed-batch fermentation model is a time-dependent input control variable, so that the computation of the effect on j with respect to f is an infinite dimensional problem. the fermentation time is divided into ten equal time partitions, and the optimal feed rate f* for the fed-batch fermentation model  <cit>  is approximated by ten piecewise constant functions.  the ten input control parameters, denoted by f
                  i

CONCLUSIONS
to deeply study the dynamic behavior of a biological system, one of the methods is to model it as a mathematical model. the most used mathematical model for simulating biological systems is the ode model. the essential task for modeling and simulating a biological system is to find the solution of an ode model efficiently and accurately. we present an algorithm with an adaptive step size control that can be used for computing the solution and dynamic sensitivities of an ode system simultaneously. instead of using error control to decide the step size in solving the model equations, our algorithm computes the step size based on the fixed-point theorem and the same step size can be used in solving the sensitivity equations.

dynamic sensitivity analysis is a useful tool to investigate the behavior of dynamic systems. in the direct methods for solving the dynamic sensitivities, sensitivity equations and model equations are coupled and solved together at the expense of more computation time. in contrast, sensitivity equations and model equations are solved separately in the decouple direct methods. the ddms are more efficient than the dms due to the dimension of odes. the chief disadvantage of ddms is the requirement of error control on both model equations and sensitivity equations. our algorithm with an efficient step control approach based on the fixed-point theorem is used to address the disadvantage of ddms. analogous to the dms, the same step size obtained by model equations is used on both model and sensitivity equations. it has been implemented and applied to well-known stiff problems with the same accuracy compared to the direct method with rosenbrock stiff integrator . as our algorithm is one of the ddms, it has the efficiency of the ddms and the same accuracy of the dms as presented in the section describing the results. by combining the efficiency and accuracy, our algorithm is an excellent method for computing dynamic parameter sensitivities in stiff problems.

we extend the scope of classical dynamic sensitivity analysis to the investigation of dynamic log gains of models with time-dependent admissible input. the parameterization method is used to approximate the infinite-dimensional computation problem for dynamic log gains in models with time-dependent admissible input by a classical finite-dimensional computation problem of dynamic log gains. then, all dynamic log gains and parameter sensitivities can be obtained simultaneously from our algorithm. appropriate parameterization allows one to obtain a more efficient way to compute the dynamic log gains with respect to a continuous time-dependent input than that by finite difference approximation. finally, the new proposed algorithm is applied to the ethanol fed-batch fermentation system, a real dynamic biological system which never reaches a steady state, with a time-varying feed rate for elucidating the applicability to realistic models with time-dependent admissible input. through the dynamic sensitivity analysis of the ethanol fed-batch fermentation model, we conclude that to get a higher ethanol production rate by increasing the ethanol yield factor is a good choice.
