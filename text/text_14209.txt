BACKGROUND

colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato is a fungal species complex encompassing more than  <dig> closely-related species  <cit> . these species interact with diverse herbaceous and woody plants as endophytes or foliar/fruit pathogens, and can be classified as generalists or specialists based on their host range specificity  <cit> . the diverse life styles within c. gloeosporioides s.l. makes it an interesting complex to study plant-microbe interactions and understand how host specificity evolves. as phytopathogens, c. gloeosporioides s.l. infect foliar as well as fruit tissues, and can cause severe field disease epidemics such as glomerella leaf spot disease on apple  and coffee berry disease on arabica coffee . while many c. gloeosporioides s.l. species are economically deleterious, certain members are economically beneficial, e.g., as biocontrol agents against weeds and phytopathogens  <cit> .

accurate species recognition in c. gloeosporioides s.l. is a complex task. morphological characters, such as the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, are very plastic, and thus cannot be relied on for precise species identification  <cit> . the species appear to have diverged relatively recently, so no single molecular marker commonly used in taxonomy  is informative enough to distinguish all lineages. species recognition thus relies heavily on multi-locus phylogeny  <cit> , and on the aid of highly polymorphic markers .

when the lineage divergence time gets very short, one critical issue for phylogeny-based species recognition is gene tree/species tree discordance due to evolutionary events such as incomplete lineage sorting, recombination, and horizontal transfer  <cit> . incomplete lineage sorting, or the inherently stochastic nature of gene genealogies at shallow levels of diversification, in particular, is the most common factor causing tree discordance which confounds species inference  <cit> ; the noise/signal ratio can be strong enough to affect multi-locus phylogeny outcome, where different gene combination schemes produce well-supported yet conflicting topologies, making species inference a tricky process  <cit> . without a consensus on the concatenation markers and the criteria to draw species boundary lines, inconsistent species classification is unavoidable  <cit> . a striking example is c. siamense s.l., for which the number of proposed species has ranged from one to seven based on analysis with different marker combinations  <cit> .

several approaches can be taken to improve the consistency and accuracy of nascent species classifications. first, an increased sample size is helpful in teasing species-level variation apart from population-level ones. second, different analytical approaches  can be applied to the same set of data for cross validation purpose. third, an improvement on the number, representativeness, and independence of analyzed genetic markers can reduce the bias effect of gene/species tree discordance.

compared with nuclear dna, mitochondrial dna  mutate more rapidly due to a higher copy number, a greater exposure to reactive oxygen species, and a less efficient dna repair system  <cit> . the mitogenome is also characterized by small size, haploidy, a shortage of recombination, and uniparental heredity. mitochondrial dna has been used to resolve evolutionary relationships of a wide range of eukaryotic life lineages at multiple taxonomic levels . however, phylogenetic analysis within c. gloeosporioides s.l. has been based solely on nuclear dna markers, whereas the suitability of mitochondrial dna has not been tested, due in large part to a lack of available mitogenome sequence. it is worth investigating whether mitochondrial dna, as a cytoplasmic factor independent of the prevailing nuclear markers, can provide additional insights into the genetic relationships of c. gloeosporioides s.l. lineages.

the first objective of this study was to obtain and compare mitogenomes from representative c. gloeosporioides s.l. lineages. weir et al.  <cit>  established musae and kahawae as the two main c. gloeosporioides s.l. clades, into which most recognized species can be classified. in this study, we analyzed nine isolates from four species lineages within or close to the musae clade. sequence comparison identified unique characteristics not observed with any previously reported colletotrichum mitogenomes, including a significant size expansion and a striking gc content elevation at the intergenic regions. when comparing the mitogenomes belonging to the c. gloeosporioides s.l. complex, we observed considerable intron content variation among otherwise highly conserved mitogenomes. such intron presence–absence polymorphism pattern can potentially be exploited for a rapid genetic diversity survey. three introns were uniquely conserved among all c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes, indicating their potential value for developing c. gloeosporioides s.l. differentiation markers. we tested four primer pairs targeting these introns, and identified one primer pair that was highly efficient in differentiating c. gloeosporioides s.l. from c. actutatum s.l..

with complete mitogenome sequences available, we also tested the usefulness of mitogenome-based phylogeny in helping resolving the genetic relationships of c. gloeosporioides s.l. lineages. our results demonstrated that mitogenome-based phylogeny recognizes nascent species divergence and is an important complement to nuclear markers in understanding c. gloeosporioides complex evolution.

methods
fungal isolates
diseased plant samples used for fungal isolation were collected from different geographic regions in china in accordance with local regulations. details about the taxonomy, host, locality, and dna marker accessions of fungal isolates are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  isolates used for genome sequencing were isolated from diseased apple  leaf or fruit tissues. c. fructicola isolates used for intron content survey were isolated from fruit or leaf lesions of apple, kiwifruit , chili pepper , pear , papaya , and nectarine . all fungal cultures were single-spore purified, maintained on potato dextrose agar , and stored as glycerol stock  at −80 °c in the fungal laboratory of northwest a&f university, yangling, shaanxi province, china.

genome sequencing and assembly
fungal mycelia were produced and harvested from liquid potato dextrose broth  shake culture. total genomic dna was extracted based on a modified cetyl trimethylammonium bromide  protocol  <cit> , which was then used to prepare sequencing libraries with a mean insertion size of 350 bp. the libraries were subjected to 100-bp pair-end sequencing with the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform at the novogene genomic sequencing center, beijing, china. raw data  of fastq format were first processed through in-house perl scripts. in this step, clean data  were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads contains ploy-n , and low-quality reads  from raw data. clean reads were then de novo assembled into scaffolds using the abyss assembler version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . contigs representing mitochondrial genomic dnas were identified by blast search. gaps were filled by pcr and standard sanger sequencing, with the used primers listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

sequence annotation and comparison
coding genes, introns, novel orfs, rrnas, and trnas were identified based on analysis with the online server mfannot , rnaweasel , and trnascan-se  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the annotations were manually inspected by comparing with colletotrichum mitogenomes using the mauve software version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . to predict the functions of identified novel orfs , the coding proteins were searched against the ncbi nr and interproscan databases. all measures of genetic diversity were calculated by dnasp version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
to accurately define the phylogenetic placement of the nine isolates used for mitogenome comparison, a bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed, including  <dig> additional c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates along with two c. alatae isolates as outgroup. all  <dig> isolates were derived from a previous study by weir et al.  <cit> . inferences were based on seven combined nuclear loci, including actin , calmodulin , chitin synthase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , glutamine synthetase , manganese-superoxide dismutase , and β-tubulin  <dig> . dna sequences for the seven loci were obtained from local draft genome assemblies, whereas dna sequences for the referent isolates were downloaded from the ncbi database . for each gene, the sequences from different isolates were aligned with mega version  <dig>  <cit>  and manually adjusted if necessary. individual alignments were concatenated using sequencematrix version  <dig>   <cit> . mrmodeltest version  <dig>   <cit>  was used to identify the aic best-fit nucleotide substitution model for each gene partition, which were gtr + i for gadph, gtr + g for cal, hky for act, sym + i for chs, gtr + g for gs, hky + g for tub <dig>  and hky + i + g for sod <dig>  phylogeny construction was based on bayesian inference  performed with mrbayes version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the bayesian analysis included two separate runs for 5 ×  <dig> generations, each sampled every  <dig> generations, convergence of all parameters was checked using the internal diagnostics. to construct the 50% major rule consensus tree, the first 25% generations were discarded as burn-in. the same procedure was used to construct a six-locus phylogeny based on a concatenated alignment excluding gs, and a five-locus phylogeny excluding gs as well as sod <dig> 

maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees used for comparative phylogenetic analysis were constructed with mega <dig>  best substitution model for each alignment was identified with either prottest version  <dig>    <cit>  or mrmodeltest version  <dig>  . for aligning the whole mitogenome, the mauve software version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to, and the conserved sites were further extracted with gblocks version  <dig> b to obtain the final gblocks alignment dataset  <cit> . shimodaira-hasegawa  test was performed with the paup* test-version  <dig> a <dig> . for each test, the null distribution was generated by  <dig>  bootstrap re-sampling via rell approximation.

survey of intron content polymorphism
to survey intron content diversity in c. fructicola,  <dig> isolates in addition to 1104– <dig> were selected . the species identity of these isolates was confirmed by apmat-locus sequencing. in total,  <dig> intron positions within five mitochondrial genes  were surveyed. primer pairs  were designed so that for a specific intron position, pcr amplicons of different sizes would be obtained between isolates containing a given intron and isolates lacking that intron. four primer pairs targeting the three introns that were uniquely conserved among all c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes  were designed and their amplification efficiency and specificity were tested with a set of c. gloeosporioides s.l. and c. actutatum isolates . primer designs were based on sequence alignments of all known colletotrichum mitogenomes. the pcrs were performed in a bio-rad thermal cycler in a total volume of 25 μl. the pcr mixtures contained 19 μl of double deionized water,  <dig>  μl of 10 × pcr buffer ,  <dig>  μl of dntps , 1 μl of each primer , 1 μl of genomic dna, and  <dig>  μl  of easytaq dna polymerase . for primers detecting the intraspecific intron content diversity of c. fructicola, the pcr condition was 4 min at 95 °c, then 20 cycles of 95 °c for 30 s, 60 °c for 30 s , 72 °c for 2 min, then 30 cycles of 95 °c for 30 s, 50 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 2 min, and then 7 min at 72 °c. the pcr condition for primers aimed at detecting c. gloeosporioides s.l. was the same as above except that the stage-ii annealing temperature ranged between 65 °c and 55 °c and the stage-iii annealing temperature was 55 °c. for pcr aimed at detecting c. gloeosporioides s.l., the reaction for each primer-isolate combination was conducted three times to assess repeatability. pcr products were analyzed with  <dig> % agarose electrophoresis.

RESULTS
phylogenetic placement of the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates selected for mitogenome sequencing
the combined nuclear gene alignment dataset comprised  <dig>  sites, among which  <dig> were parsimony-informative. the 50% majority rule consensus bayesian tree  was identical in topology to the one reported by weir et al.  <cit> . based on the dendrogram, we classified the nine isolates  into four lineages, including c. fructicola , c. aenigma , c. gloeosporioides sensu stricto , and c. siamense s.l. . c. fructicola has been reported to contain two clades indistinguishable in morphology and cultural appearance, both being widely distributed and associated with diverse hosts  <cit> . isolate 1104– <dig> fell into the clade containing the ex-holotype icmp  <dig> . the isolate xy- <dig> was classified as c. aenigma, a sister species of c. fructicola. worldwide, c. aenigma has been known only from two collections, icmp  <dig> from persea americana in israel and icmp  <dig> from pyrus pyrifolia in japan . on the phylogenetic tree, icmp  <dig> and icmp  <dig> were much closer to each other than to xy- <dig>  six isolates in this study  belonged to c. siamense s.l., a taxonomically controversial lineage being regarded as either a single species  <cit>  or a species complex  <cit> . as a species complex, icmp  <dig> and icmp  <dig> had been treated as independent species, being c. hymenocallidis  <cit>  and c. jasmini-sambac  <cit>  respectively. on the phylogenetic tree, the six c. siamense s.l. isolates located on three separate clades. sq <dig>  lq <dig> and zh <dig> were close to icmp  <dig> , zh <dig> and zh <dig> were close to icmp 18574; yt <dig> was distal from all other c. siamense s.l. isolates, forming an independent branch with100% posterior probability, which supported the interpretation that yt <dig> represents a novel species if c. siamense s.l. is seen as a species complex. lq <dig> was classified as c. gloeosporioides based on its close affinity to the epitype culture icmp  <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic placement of the colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. isolates selected for mitogenome sequencing. the fifty percent majority rule consensus bayesian tree was based on a 7-gene combined dataset . the alignment was partitioned, and the best dna substitution model for each gene was determined by mrmodeltest. colletotrichum alatae isolates were used as the outgroup and the tree was mid-point rooted. ex-type cultures are marked with ‘*’. for each node, posterior probability is displayed




introns and intergenic regions drive the significant size expansion of c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes
prior to this study, five complete colletotrichum mitogenomes were available in the genbank database: three within the c. acutatum species complex , one within the c. orbiculare complex , and one within the c. graminicola complex . through illumina dna sequencing and assembly, we obtained the complete mitogenome sequences of the nine aforementioned c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates. we compared these  <dig> mitogenomes in detail regarding their sizes, gc contents, gene contents, codon usage patterns and intron characteristics .

the sizes of the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp , the sizes of the five mitogenomes outside of the complex ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp  ; the average size of the former group was  <dig>  times larger than the latter group. the average coding region lengths for mitogenomes within and outside of c. gloeosporioides s.l. were very close:  <dig>  ±  <dig> and  <dig>  ± 103 bp respectively. on the other hand, the corresponding values for the intergenic regions differed by  <dig>  fold, being  <dig>  ±  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp respectively. c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes also contained significantly more introns. the three c. acutatum s.l. mitogenomes  contained no intron, c. lindemuthianum and c. graminicola contained three and one intron, with total length of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively; the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes, on the other hand, contained from six to  <dig> introns , with total length ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp.fig.  <dig> size expansions and intergenic gc content elevations of the colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes. a size and content variations of colletotrichum mitogenomes. exon refers to oxidative phosphorylation protein-coding genes. rns, small ribosomal rna; rnl, large ribosomal rna. b differences in average gc contents between the genic and intergenic regions of c. gloeosporioides s.l. and c. actutatum s.l.. plotted values are mean ± s.d., n =  <dig> for c. gloeosporioides s.l., n =  <dig> for c. actutatum s.l




when considering all  <dig> isolates, the summed length of intronic and intergenic regions closely predicted the total length of the mitogenome . when introns and intergenic regions were considered separately, the r
 <dig> values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. taken together, the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes were much larger in size than those of any previously reported colletotrichum groups, and the size expansion was attributable to length increases of both introns and intergenic regions, but not the coding regions.

the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes have significantly higher gc content compared with other colletotrichum spp. due specifically to striking intergenic gc content elevation
the gc content of the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> % , whereas the values for members not belonging to the complex ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> % . the average value for the former group was significantly higher than the latter . in the genic regions , the average gc content values for members in and out of c. gloeosporioides s.l. were close:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively. in contrast, the corresponding values for the intergenic regions were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively, differing by almost 10%.

the c. gloeosporioides s.l. and c. acutatum s.l. mitogenomes were identical in gene order, which allowed us to compare their genic/intergenic gc content dynamics in more detail. average gc content values for  <dig> genic and  <dig> intergenic regions were plotted . in all genic regions, the values of the two groups were very similar, but in all intergenic regions except rnl-nad <dig> and cox2-nad4l, the values for c. gloeosporioides s.l. were much higher than for c. acutatum s.l. . moreover, the gc content for all but one  c. gloeosporioides s.l. intergenic region was much higher than the neighboring genic regions, which however, was only observed with three out of  <dig> intergenic regions in c. acutatum s.l. .

comparative analysis of the sequence, codon usage, and gene organization features of the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes
dna sequences of the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes were highly conserved. the mitogenome gblocks alignment dataset contained  <dig>  characters, among which merely  <dig> were polymorphic . alignment of the protein-coding regions produced a dataset containing <dig>  characters, among which merely  <dig> were polymorphic . the mitogenome nucleotide diversity value  was lower than all compared nuclear markers , indicating extremely slow overall evolution rate. yet, due to length advantage, the mitogenome gblocks alignment dataset contained the largest number of phylogenetically informative sites , which was  <dig>  times more than that of the most polymorphic nuclear marker, apmat .fig.  <dig> a comparison of the phylogenetic information conveyed by the mitogenome sequences and that of commonly used nuclear markers. a nucleotide diversity value . b parsimony informative sites . the calculations of π and s were either based on all c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates  or based on the c. siamense s.l. isolates alone 




each of the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes encoded  <dig> identical genes transcribed in the same direction , including  <dig> oxidative phosphorylation proteins , a ribosomal protein , large  and small  rrnas, and  <dig> trnas . the  <dig> trnas recognized all  <dig> standard amino acids, with three for valine, three for methionine, two for arginine, two for serine, and two for leucine. the order of the  <dig> genes was identical among all mitogenomes.fig.  <dig> sequence comparison of the colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes. the features of lq <dig>  and its comparison with other members are shown. a the lq <dig> mitogenome gene features. proteins  and rrnas  are shown on top whereas trnas  are shown in bottom. b distributions of lq <dig> mismatch sites compared with indicated mitogenomes. following isolate id, total matched and mismatched sites  are shown. c distribution of lq <dig> insertion sites compared with indicated mitogenomes. following isolate id, total insertion length and insertion sites are shown. d sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity  based on the nine mitogenomes . plots in all panels  share the same coordinate , the unit for which is kilo base 




pairwise comparison identified several characteristics associated with the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes:  mitogenomes within c. siamense s.l. were more similar to each other than to mitogenomes from different species lineages ;  within c. siamense s.l., sq <dig> and yt <dig> were nearly identical in dna sequences  despite falling far apart on the nuclear gene tree ; the mitogenomes of sq <dig> and yt <dig> were identical except for eight indel sites located either in introns or in intergenic regions, among which were six small-sized ones  and two large-sized ones ; all six small-sized indels were within single-nucleotide short dna repeats;  nucleotide insertion/deletion events were less frequent compared with mutation events, and most large insertion/deletion events were due to intron gain/losses ;  polymorphic sites distributed unevenly along the mitogenome, with the frequency being much higher in the intergenic and intronic regions than the coding regions ;  a small coding region of the cox <dig> gene showed strong signal of lineage-specific rapid divergence. among the  <dig> polymorphic sites present in the mitogenome protein-coding regions,  <dig> were synonymous and  <dig> were nonsynonymous; these sites were distributed in eight of  <dig> genes . strikingly, up to  <dig> of the  <dig> nonsynonymous sites were specifically located within a 142-bp long region of cox <dig> , and most were singletons conferred by zh <dig>  . further pcr and sanger resequencing confirmed the nucleotide identity of zh <dig> in this region .

codon usage frequencies were indistinguishable among the nine mitogenomes . all protein-encoding genes began with the typical aug start codon except cox <dig> with uug, and all ended with the uaa stop codon except cox <dig> and nad <dig> with uag. the most-frequently used codons were the same: uua , aua , uuu , and aau . on the other hand, ugc , cgc , cgg , agg  were universally absent. in addition, a number of codons were under-represented , e.g. cga , cuc , acg , aag , cag , ccc , ggc , guc , acc , ugg , and ccg . such codon usage patterns were similarly observed in other colletotrichum mitogenomes . among all colletotrichum mitogenomes, the cgc and agg codons coding for lysine were absent; moreover, codons present at higher frequency tended to favor a and t nucleotides, in accordance with reports in other fungi  <cit> .

the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes shared identical orders of protein-coding genes, rrnas and trnas. we further examined the extent of such order conservation in the hypocreomycetidae subclass. for protein-coding genes and rrnas , the c. gloeosporioides s.l. order was conserved among all c. actutatum s.l. members and all hypocreales members except acremonium chrysogenum, suggesting that this order represents the ancestral status of hypocreomycetidae. the orders of c. graminicola, c. lindemuthianum, verticillium nonalfalfae, v. dahlia and a. chrysogenum were slightly different, involving one or two dna rearrangement events .fig.  <dig> mitogenome gene order evolution in the hypocreomycetidae subclass. dotted line indicates identical gene order compared with the reference . gene rearrangement events are highlighted in color. for trnas, the corresponding amino acid abbreviations are shown. genbank accessions for colletotrichum mitogenomes are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  genbank accessions for additional mitogenomes are as follows. verticillium nonalfalfae, kr704425; v. dahliae, dq351941; acremonium chrysogenum, kf757229; fusarium solani, nc_016680; f. graminearum, nc_009493; f. oxysporum, ay945289; f. verticillioides, nc_016687; beauveria bassiana, eu371503; cordyceps brongniartii, nc_011194; pochonia chlamydosporia, kf479445; metarhizium anisopliae, ay884128; trichoderma asperellum, kr952346




in each of the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes,  <dig> of  <dig> trnas clustered together and formed four groups, which were between rns and cox <dig> , between cox <dig> and nad <dig> , between nad <dig> and rnl , and between rnl and cox <dig> . we identified and compared trnas belonging to these four clusters in different hypocreomycetidae mitogenomes . in general, the extent of trna content and organization variation correlated well with taxonomic distance. for instance, in cluster i, all verticillium and colletotrichum members had ‘y n’ whereas hypocreales members had ‘y d s’ or ‘y d s n’; in cluster ii, all verticillium and colletotrichum members had at least three genes, ‘g d s’, whereas hypocreales members only had a ‘g’ or none at all; and in cluster iv, all hypocreales members had a trnk  gene, which was absent in both verticillium and colletotrichum.

within the genus colletotrichum, trna organization of c. graminicola and c. lindemuthianum was identical to that of c. gloeosporioides s.l. members. the three species belonging to the c. actutatum complex, on the other hand, had different trna organization in cluster ii. compared with c. gloeosporioides s.l. , the trna organization for c. tamarilloi and c. actutatum was ‘g d s’ whereas that for c. lupini was ‘g d s s’. sequence comparison indicated that the trns duplication in c. lupini was due to a lineage-specific  <dig>  bp dna insertion event .

significant intron content variation among the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes
in total, seventy-one introns were identified among the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes . these introns ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp in size, and were located at  <dig> conserved positions within six oxidative phosphorylation protein-encoding genes, which included nine in cox <dig>  two in cob, two in nad <dig>  one in nad <dig>  one in cox <dig>  and one in nad <dig>  all identified introns belonged to the group i intron family except for cox1- <dig>  which lacked distinguishable features for classification. the group i introns could be further subdivided into type i-a , type i-b , type i-c <dig> , and type i-d . the cox1- <dig> intron, present in zh <dig> and zh <dig>  belonged to type i but could not be further subdivided. except for cox1- <dig>  introns at all positions harbored homing endonuclease genes  known to direct intron mobility. intronic hegs could be further divided into laglidadg and giy-yig families. forty-five introns at  <dig> positions harbored laglidadgs whereas  <dig> introns at another five positions harbored giy-yigs.fig.  <dig> the colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenome introns. the  <dig> type i introns  locate at  <dig> conserved positions in six genes, and most harbor homing endonuclease genes . filled and open symbols mark introns with slightly different features. for cob- <dig>  the intron sizes of xy <dig>  1104– <dig> and lq <dig> are smaller. for cox1- <dig> and nad5- <dig>  the introns in c. lindemuthianum and c. graminicola have different intron phases. please refer to additional file 1: table s <dig> for detailed information about the positions, codon phases and lengths of introns




in general, introns at the same position were highly similar in terms of length and sequence. however, the cob- <dig> site was an exception, where the intron sizes of xy <dig>  1104– <dig>  and lq <dig>  were much smaller than the c. siamense s.l. members  . sequence comparison showed the size difference was due to non-homologous sequences at the 3′ region .

high-level intron content variation was observed among the nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes. each mitogenome contained a unique set of introns. among the  <dig> intron positions, cob- <dig>  cox1- <dig>  and cox1- <dig> were the only three positions conserved among all genomes . considerable intron presence-absence polymorphism was also observed within c. siamense s.l., for which nine out of  <dig> positions were polymorphic. the presence-absence polymorphism was also observed between sq <dig> and yt <dig>  two isolates being almost identical in mitogenome sequence. these result demonstrated rapid evolutionary dynamics of introns in c. gloeosporioides s.l.

we further surveyed the intraspecific intron content variation in another c. gloeosporioides s.l. species, c. fructicola, for which we analyzed  <dig> intron positions and  <dig> isolates  . these c. fructicola isolates were isolated from different hosts and from different locations , and contained five apmat haplotypes, and were thus genetically different. the intron content patterns of these  <dig> isolates could be classified into three types. eleven isolates, containing all five apmat haplotypes, had completely identical intron content. three other isolates  had slightly different intron contents. the apmat nucleotide diversity value calculated from the  <dig> c. fructicola isolates was  <dig> , much lower than that of c. siamense s.l. . thus, both intron content and apmat locus sequence data supported a lower level of intraspecific genetic diversity of c. fructicola.fig.  <dig> intraspecific intron content polymorphism in colletotrichum fructicola. the intron presence-absence patterns of  <dig> surveyed isolates, together with the nucleotides of these isolates at five polymorphic sites within a 762 bp long alignment of apmat locus dnas are shown. the intron content of the c. aenigma isolate xy <dig> is shown as a comparison. genbank accessions of the apmat locus sequences are listed in additional file 1: table s1




the unique conservation of cob- <dig>  cox1- <dig>  and cox1- <dig> introns in c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates indicated their potential value for molecular identification of taxa within c. gloeosporioides s.l.. we designed four primer pairs targeting these introns . the primer pair p1/p <dig>  p7/p <dig> targeted cob- <dig> and cox1- <dig> respectively; the four primer binding sites were in exons and were highly conserved among at least four divergent colletotrichum species complexes . the primer pairs p3/p <dig> and p5/p <dig> recognized two separate regions inside cox1- <dig>  supposed to be unique to c. gloeosporioides s.l.. the designed primer pairs were tested against eight c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates and five c. actutatum s.l. isolates . all primer pairs produced strong and specific bands when using the c. gloeosporioides s.l. dnas as templates, indicating high amplification efficiencies. when using the c. actutatum s.l. dnas as templates, p3/p <dig> and p5/p <dig> generated amplifications from time to time, the size of which matched that expected for c. gloeosporioides s.l., indicating poor primer specificity. p7/p <dig> produced ~ <dig>  bp amplicons for all c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates and ~120 bp amplicons for all c. actutatum s.l. isolates, the ~120 bp amplicons were relatively weak and indistinctive from primer dimers, so this can be problematic for identification purposes. for p1/p <dig>  all c. actutatum s.l. isolates produced an expected ~ 360 bp band whereas all c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates produced bands larger than  <dig>  bp , amplicon size differences among the c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates perfectly matched their cob- <dig> intron sizes as reported above. in repeated experiments, p1/p <dig> always produced strong and specific bands for both c. actutatum s.l. and c. gloeosporioides s.l., providing clear distinction between these groups.

implications of mitogenome-based phylogeny
we first constructed maximum likelihood  phylogenetic trees based on either mitogenome proteins or mitogenome protein-coding dnas. on both trees, all nine c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates clustered into a well-support monophyletic clade neighbored by c. lindemuthianum, c. actutatum s.l. and c. graminicola . these species together represented the colletotrichum genus. on the protein tree, the genus colletotrichum was neighbored by verticillium spp.; the two genera together were further neighbored by hypocreales. such a topological pattern was in accordance with the genetic relationships of glomerellales, plectosphaerellaceae and hypocreales  <cit> , and supported the previous phylogenetic placement of c. gloeosporioides s.l. based on nuclear markers. no phylogenetic structure was detected within c. gloeosporioides s.l. members on either tree, due to an exceptionally low level of sequence variations.

a ml phylogenetic tree was further constructed based on the  <dig>  bp long mitogenome gblocks alignment . the nine isolates formed four well-separated clades, corresponding to c. siamense s.l. , c. aenigma , c. fructicola , and c. gleosporioides  respectively. such topological pattern correlates well with their distributions on the nuclear marker-based phylogenetic tree . within c. siamense s.l., however, a strong discordance was observed between the mitogenome and nuclear trees. the ‘mito’ tree contained two distinctive clades, one clade included zh <dig>  zh <dig>  and zh <dig> whereas the other clade included sq <dig>  yt <dig>  and lq <dig> , sq <dig>  yt <dig>  and lq <dig> were almost indistinguishable. on the nuclear tree , the six c. siamense s.l. isolates formed two groups with yt <dig> being separated from all other isolates. the striking different phylogenetic positions of yt <dig> highlighted a discordance between mitogenome and nuclear markers in c. siamense s.l.. preliminary analysis showed that the phylogenetic discordance could be eliminated by excluding the gs and sod <dig> markers from analysis . the apmat marker-based phylogeny  was highly similar in topology compared with that based on mitogenome.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed from different datasets. for concatenation tree, markers used for concatenation are shown. best nucleotide substitution models for ‘mito’, ‘nucl’, ‘gssod-excluded’, ‘gs-excluded’, ‘sod2-excluded’, ‘apmat’, ‘gs’, and ‘sod’ phylogenetic trees were determined by mrmodeltest, which were ‘gtr + g + i’, ‘hky + g + i’, ‘hky + i’, ‘hky + i’, ‘hky + g + i’, ‘hky + i’, ‘hky’, and ‘hky + g’ respectively. numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values based on  <dig>  replicates. green color indicates c. siamense s.l




shimodaira-hasegawa  test was further performed to test marker incongruence . the mitogenome-based tree  was compared with the tree based on concatenated nuclear loci . as a control, the ‘mito’ tree was also compared with the ‘gssod-excluded’ tree , the ‘gs-excluded’ tree , the ‘sod-excluded’ tree , and the ‘apmat’ tree . sh tests were carried out against different nuclear marker datasets. as shown in table  <dig>  at  <dig>  significance level, all nuclear markers equally supported the tested trees when comparing the ‘mito’ tree with either the ‘apmat’ tree or with the ‘gssod-excluded’ tree. when comparing the ‘mito’ tree with the ‘nucl’ tree, act, tub <dig>  cal, gadph, chs and sod <dig> equally supported the two trees whereas gs strongly favored the ‘nucl’ tree . such strong topological bias of the gs marker, however, was not observed when comparing the ‘mito’ tree with the ‘gs-excluded’ tree . in actual fact, the gs marker favored the ‘mito’ tree slightly more than the ‘gs-excluded’ tree . thus, the topological incongruence between the ‘mito’ tree and the ‘nucl’ tree was mainly caused by gs. the sod <dig> marker strongly favored the ‘gs-excluded’ tree over the ‘mito’ tree , while equally supporting the ‘mito’ tree and the ‘nucl’ tree , indicating that the effect of gs masked that of sod <dig> table  <dig> the shimodaira-hasegawa  test result

given the significant biased effects of gs and sod <dig>  we performed further concatenation phylogenic analysis of the  <dig> c. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates by excluding either the gs marker alone , or the gs marker as well as the sod <dig> marker  from the alignment dataset. when only gs was excluded, all species lineages still formed monophyletic clades and the tree topology was in general identical to the previous seven-locus tree . the six c. siamense s.l. isolates formed two clades, and clade one includes all isolates except sq <dig>  when both gs and sod <dig> were excluded, all c. siamense s.l. isolates clustered into one well-supported clade , and no further genetic structure could be recognized; all other species lineages could still be recognized with high confidence except for c. fructicola, for which the two intraspecific groups formed sister clades. in general, it was clear that presence/absence of the gs and sod <dig> markers strongly affected the phylogenetic positions of yt <dig> and sq01; thus, lineage-specific divergences of gs and sod <dig> were the main sources causing phylogenetic incongruence.

we further examined polymorphism sites in the gs and sod <dig> alignments for sequence patterns potentially explaining their lineage-specific divergences . the gs marker is made up of a large partial intron  and a very small coding region . the alignment dataset contained  <dig> polymorphic sites for the c. siamense s.l. isolates, among which  <dig> were yt02-specific mutations; these  <dig> mutations occurred throughout the alignment, and  <dig> were transitions, including eight c to t  and four t to c . the sod <dig> marker located in the coding region , and the alignment contained  <dig> polymorphic sites among which  <dig> were sq01-specific mutations, also dispersed in distribution. all sq01-specific mutations were synonymous and located at the third codon positions except 216a to g and 217g to a, which together caused a ‘agc’  to ‘gac’  codon change. in general, we observed no obvious selection-indicative sequence pattern with either the gs or sod <dig> marker, in accordance with a hypothesis that incomplete lineage sorting has driven the observed divergences.

discussion
the fungal species complex c. gloeosporioides s.l. is economically and ecologically important, yet taxonomically challenging. in this study, mitogenomes representing nine taxonomic lineages were first determined, which provides useful resources for further genetic studies. many features observed with the nine mitogenomes are also typical of the hypocreomycetidae subclass and even the sordariomycetes class; for instance, the transcription of all protein-encoding genes in the same direction, the presence of rps <dig> gene within the ribosomal large subunit, the conserved ordering of protein-encoding genes, trnas, and rrnas, and the prevalence of heg-containing introns. compared with known colletotrichum mitogenomes, however, the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes are also distinctive for containing longer intergenic regions with elevated gc content and for being much richer in introns.

gc bias is common with both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , and the gc contents of closely-related lineages can differ significantly  <cit> . the average intergenic gc content of c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes is around 10% higher than that of the genic regions. although it remains to be determined whether such striking difference is prevalent in filamentous fungi, the lack of elevation in other colletotrichum mitogenomes indicates a lineage specificity. the gc content elevation is prevalent among most intergenic regions, indicating that the elevation is not due to regional horizontal dna transfer. both neutral evolutionary events, such as biased mutation or biased gene conversion, and natural selection have been implicated to drive gc content evolution  <cit> . the striking gc content elevation observed in this study is specific to the intergenic regions where dnas are under the least functional constraint, which would indicate neutral evolutionary forces. mitochondrial dna mutations, however, are at biased due to increased likelihood of cytosine deamination or guanine oxidation  <cit> . thus, if the gc content elevation is evolutionarily neutral, biased gene conversion would be a more likely mechanism. gene conversion, however, relies on dna mismatch repair system and dna recombination events, the occurrence and frequency of which in c. gloeosporioides s.l. must be confirmed.

regarding the natural selection hypothesis, genome gc content elevation has been implicated to confer an adaptation advantage toward high temperature, uv exposure or conditions where high dna stability is required  <cit> . if the intergenic dnas are rich with regulatory elements, the intergenic gc content elevation observed here could in principle be relevant to the modulation of mitochondrial gene expressions, a mechanism proposed to explain the correlation between gc content and stress tolerance observed with monocot plants  <cit> .

while the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenome sequences are highly conserved, particularly at the coding regions, we have identified a 142-bp-long region in the cox <dig> orf showing strong lineage-specific divergence. the short region contains  <dig> polymorphic sites, the frequency of which is over 300-fold higher than the rest of the coding regions. moreover, up to  <dig> sites are non-synonymous, indicating functional relevance of the nucleotide changes. most polymorphic sites are zh03-specific singletons, demonstrating that this dna region evolves differently in zh <dig>  likely involving recombination or horizontal transfer events. while its evolutionary origin and biological implications are unclear, the presence of such feature emphasizes the advantage of phylogenetic analysis based on entire mitogenome over partial mtdna sequence.

broad intron content variation exists among fungal mitogenomes, where both interspecific and intraspecific variations have been documented. moreover, intron content variation has been a main source explaining the size variation commonly observed with closely-related mitogenomes . in this study, significant intron content variation exists both among and within c. gloeosporioides s.l. species, and most introns contain hegs of either laglidadg or giy-yig type. such pattern suggests that horizontal intron cycling  <cit> , a mechanism known to regulate intron gain and loss process, also plays a significant role in shaping the intron dynamics of c. gloeosporioides s.l.


colletotrichum gloeosporioides was established in the 1950s, but understanding of its taxonomic position has shifted over time. the current broad concept  is defined by its phylogeny  <cit> , and morphological phenotypes alone are unreliable for its identification from other lineages, such as c. boninense species complex  <cit>  and c. cliviae  <cit> . due to historical reason, many genbank-deposited ‘c. gloeosporioides’ sequences are inaccurately annotated  <cit> , which can be a problem for its-based identification. the development of a secondary c. gloeosporioides s.l. identification marker is thus advantageous. introns at three positions  are conserved among all c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes; however, none of them was observed in mitogenomes outside of the c. gloeosporioides s.l. complex, indicating a potential utility for pcr-based detection. we further tested four primer pairs and identified p1/p <dig> targeting cob- <dig> as the one with the highest specificity. the p1/p <dig> primer pair identifies c. gloeosporioides s.l. based on amplicon size increase, instead of amplicon presence; such a strategy is more advantageous because:  all surveyed samples should produce amplification bands indicating successful pcr reaction, thus this is a good positive internal control of dna template and pcr reagents; and  the strategy dramatically reduces the likelihood of non-specific primer binding and non-specific amplification, thus improving detection specificity and repeatability, which is a critical advantage in pcr-based detections. the p1/p <dig> primer-binding sites are highly conserved among very divergent species complexes , and are thus likely to be applicable across the whole colletotrichum genus. another advantage of the p1/p <dig> primer pair is that it detects mtdna, which has a high copy number and is easily amplified. however, the p1/p <dig> effectiveness has been validated with only relatively few c. gloeosporioides s.l. and c. actutatum s.l. isolates, so it is critical to test its practical efficiency and specificity with more representative isolates in the future.

for recently divergent lineages, gene tree/species tree discordance is a critical factor confounding species inference. one approach to overcome this bias is to improve the number, representativeness, and independence of analyzed genetic markers. taxonomic studies in c. gloeosporioides s.l. have relied almost entirely on nuclear markers, whereas we have diverged from this pattern by exploring the merit of a mitogenome tree. the length advantage of mitogenome alignment overcomes its drawback of low-level nucleotide diversity. in the present study, the final mitogenome alignment contains  <dig>  times more phylogenetically informative sites than that of apmat. the alignment dataset produces a very solid tree in high resolution, based on which the relationships of very nascent lineages can be inferred. the merit of complete mitogenome sequences, however, lies not only in the generation of a gene tree in high resolution, but perhaps more importantly in the fact that it provides information about the lineage evolutionary histories based on a factor different from all prevailing markers in use. by comparing these independent markers, one can have a better chance of teasing out phylogenetic signals not related to species divergence, and delimitating nascent species with increased accuracy. the relationship between yt <dig> and sq <dig> analyzed in this study is a striking illustration. neither phylogeny based on apmat nor phylogeny based on the concatenation of act, tub <dig>  gadph, cal, chs markers separate the two isolates. however, if gs and sod <dig> markers were further included in the concatenation, the resulting tree would separate the two isolates into different c. siamense s.l. species. without additional information, one would hesitate in deciding which phylogeny to put trust on. yet, based on the information that sq <dig> and yt <dig> have almost identical mitogenomes and the information that the mitogenome phylogeny is congruent with all other markers except gs and sod <dig>  one can confidently postulate that the strong lineage-specific sequence divergences of gs and sod <dig> are due to evolutionary events independent of species divergence. further examination of polymorphism sites did not identify evidence of selection, thereby indicating incomplete lineage sorting, one of the most common reasons causing species tree/gene tree incongruence in nascent species, as a plausible reason. our study shows that by integrating mitogenome sequence information, we have a better chance of discovering and correcting phylogenetic incongruity among the prevailing nuclear markers, which is a very critical step for the accurate recognition of nascent species. compared with the mitochondrial genome, the nuclear genome is much larger and contains far more genes. phylogenomic approaches, particularly ones considering the genome-wide variation of gene tree topologies, will allow one to delimit species boundaries to a much higher degree of confidence and accuracy. such analysis is within expectation as the cost of whole-genome sequencing keeps dropping.

when applying mtdna markers for phylogenetic studies, it is important to keep in mind that mtdna is a cytoplasmic factor, the inherence and population dynamics of which can be quite different from nuclear dna. the genetic exchange of mtdna is achieved via either vegetative hyphal cell fusion limited by vegetative compatibility , or via maternal  inheritance limited by female fertility. the exchange of nuclear dna, on the other hand, occurs in a biparental direction and is limited by cross fertility. when outcrossing is common, mutations of both nuclear and mtdna can spread in the population. when outcrossing is rare, the spread of nuclear dna mutations is restricted, generating genetic isolation. the spread of mtdna mutations, on the other hand, may still be unaffected if vegetative compatibility is not affected. in c. gloeosporioides s.l., the cross-fertility phenotype is highly variable among isolates and species, whereas the presence and number of vc groups in most species are unknown. nuclear and mtdna may also spread among closely-related species through interspecific hybridization or hyphal fusion events. the combined interaction effects of potential intraspecific genetic isolation and interspecific genetic exchange of nuclear as well as cytoplasmic markers are hard to predict, so it is difficult to conclude whether nuclear or mitochondrial markers are more advantageous for species inference in this context. similarly, phylogenetic trees from the two sources may not necessarily be fully congruent, and both may deviate away from true species relationships, which means that one must stay cautious about relying fully on either one for species inference. on the other hand, conclusions derived from concordant phylogenetic information derived from two sources will be more reliable than from a single source. for nuclear as well as mitochondrial dna markers, it is also important that an adequate number of isolates is sampled so as that the observed variations approximate species-level changes more closely.

CONCLUSIONS
the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes characterized in this study are highly conserved in dna sequence, gene content, gene transcribing direction, and gene order. many mitogenome features are also conserved at higher taxonomic levels. on the other hand, these mitogenomes collectively have higher intron content and non-homogenous gc content distribution which were not observed with any previously reported colletotrichum mitogenomes. despite high sequence similarity, considerable intron content polymorphism exists among c. gloeosporioides s.l. lineages, indicating its potential application as a genetic diversity marker. phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the usefulness of mitogenome in complementing nuclear genes for c. gloeosporioides s.l. species delimitation. taken together, the c. gloeosporioides s.l. mitogenomes revealed in this study are important resources for further studies into the biology, genetics, and evolution of this economically important fungal species complex.
