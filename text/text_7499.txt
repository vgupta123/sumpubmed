BACKGROUND
c <dig> photosynthesis differs from c <dig> photosynthesis by possessing a co <dig> concentrating mechanism, which enables c <dig> plants to achieve higher light, water, and nitrogen use efficiencies  <cit> . the higher photosynthetic efficiency in c <dig> plants is achieved by elevating the concentration of co <dig> around ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase . extensive efforts have been made to engineer a c <dig> photosynthetic machinery into c <dig> plants such as rice and wheat  <cit> . elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the evolution of the key components of the concentrating process in c <dig> plants and identifying its molecular regulators, either as cis-regulatory elements or trans-factors and controlling c <dig> photosynthetic features  <cit>  are necessary to successfully perform c <dig> photosynthesis  <cit> . to date, despite the establishment of the biochemical and anatomical features of c <dig> photosynthesis, our understanding of the genetic control of various c <dig> properties such as the reduction in interveinal distance, increased number of chloroplasts within bundle sheath  cells, extensive differentiation of m and bs chloroplast proteomes, and higher plasmodesmata abundance for transport between m and bs cells  <cit>  is limited. more efforts to identify regulatory elements required for the establishment of cell-specific expression patterns of c <dig> photosynthesis-related genes are warranted. various approaches, including both forward genetics and reverse genetics approaches, have been utilized to address this question  <cit> .

to date, the cis-regulatory motifs controlling the cell-specific expression patterns of c4-related genes have been mainly discovered through experimental approaches such as deletion analysis  <cit> . recent technological advances in computational biology have facilitated the identification of motifs . such computational analyses usually start with clustering genes from a transcriptomic data set into different clusters, followed by prediction of motifs in genes from each cluster . one underlying assumption of this approach is that genes within the same cluster are potentially regulated by common cis-regulatory elements. however, there are circumstances where this assumption is violated. for example, let us consider three genes, a, b, and c. genes a and b are regulated by the same cis-regulatory elements, whereas c is regulated by b and hence shows the same expression pattern as that of b. if the expression pattern is used as the sole criterion in clustering these genes, then these three genes will be misclassified into the same gene cluster, which in turn can lead to the inaccurate detection of cis-regulatory elements. gene regulatory networks constructed based on conditional mutual information can solve the issue of misclassifying genes into the same cluster because this algorithm only detects genes with direct regulatory relationships  <cit> .

in the present study, we examined the potential mechanism related to the formation of new cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of c4-related genes. to do this, we first identified the potentially recruited cis-regulatory elements using gene regulatory networks constructed based on conditional mutual information. furthermore, we used three sets of motifs, i.e., network-derived motifs, experimentally identified cis-regulatory elements, and predicted bundle sheath specific motifs, to test whether these exist in the genes directly linked to the c <dig> ortholog of c <dig> genes in a c <dig> gene regulatory network. lastly, to explore the potential mechanisms responsible for the recruitment of these motifs, we explored whether the potentially recruited motifs reside in the overlapping regions between transposable elements  and promoter regions of the c <dig> genes. we discussed all these results in light of the hypothesis that transposons play a role in the recruitment of these motifs during the emergence of c <dig> photosynthesis.

RESULTS
identification of cis-regulatory elements that were potentially recruited during c <dig> evolution
based on the strategy shown in fig.  <dig>   <dig> pairs of orthologs of the c <dig> genes in maize and rice, including its promoter sequences, were obtained. we checked the distribution of bs cell-specific motifs in these  <dig> pairs . we identified seven motifs that might have been potentially recruited during c <dig> evolution based on the following criteria: a) these are differentially distributed in c <dig> and c <dig> orthologs; b) these existed in the neighboring genes of the c <dig> orthologs .fig.  <dig> distribution of motifs in genes before and after recruitment. a before the recruitment, the donor  is located in a neighboring gene of the acceptor  in a gene regulatory network . b before the recruitment, the donor contains the motif  and the acceptor  lacks the motif. c after a copy-and-paste recruitment, the acceptor  contains the motif  recruits the motif , whereas the donor loses the motif



evidence for potential involvement of transposon in motif recruitment
we next tested whether transposons played a role during this motif movement. considering that a small chromosomal distance facilitates transposition, we first determined the distance between the donor gene to the acceptor gene relative to the total length of the chromosome, and identified candidate donor genes that were located <1/ <dig> of the total length of the chromosome from the acceptor genes . furthermore, when te transferred a motif to another locus, the particular motif should be within the overlapping region of tes and the promoters of the donor gene. we hence aligned the sequences of tes with those of the promoters of donor genes by using blast  <cit>  and identified the overlapping regions. all seven motifs that were differentially distributed in c <dig> and c <dig> orthologs were indeed present in the overlapping regions of tes and candidate donors of motifs . these two pieces of evidence suggest that transposons may have played a role in the recruitment of these bs cell-specific motifs.fig.  <dig> proportion of donors that were proximal to the acceptor. for each acceptor  and each potentially recruited bundle sheath-specific motif , the proportion of donors  that were near to the acceptor in the chromosome where the acceptor gene resides is indicated



recruited motifs are possible binding sites for transcription factors
earlier reports have shown that tes contribute to the formation of new tf binding sites  <cit>  and evolution of new regulatory mechanisms. here we checked whether the recruited motifs are potential binding sites of transcription factors . we tested  <dig> tfs, for which the position weight matrix information is available from transfac . for the potentially recruited motifs and tfs, we calculated their binding possibilities . seven of these potentially recruited motifs showed higher  binding affinities with tfs compared to the calculated affinity for random elements of the same length as the motif . several of the tfs binding to these motifs were earlier identified to be potential regulators of photosynthesis such as opaque- <dig> and gbf   <cit> .table  <dig> potentially recruited bundle sheath cells specific motifs have higher binding affinity with tfs compared to randomly generated sequence of the same length



occurrence of te-driven motif recruitment in the experimentally validated motifs
to test whether te-driven motif recruitment is a general phenomenon, we further examined whether tes are involved in the recruitment of motifs that were experimentally identified to be related to their host gene’ cell-specific gene expression pattern  <cit>  and also the predicted cis-regulatory motifs based on the genes in the same gene community in a gene regulatory network.

of the  <dig> experimentally validated motifs, five were identified as potentially recruited motifs . of these five potentially recruited motifs, four resided in the overlapping region of tes and their candidate donors . in addition, the donors of these four motifs were proximally located to the acceptors in their residing chromosome . similar to the analysis of the bs cell-specific motifs, the five putative recruited and validated motifs showed higher binding affinity to tfs .table  <dig> transposable elements that may have played a crucial role in mediating transfer of experimentally validated motifs from the candidate donors to a c <dig> acceptor gene

we also obtained similar results in the analysis of network-derived motifs. there were  <dig>  motifs differentially distributed in the c <dig> and c <dig> orthologs, and  <dig>  of these were identified as potential recruited motifs . a total of  <dig> of the  <dig>  potentially recruited motifs were present in the overlapping region of tes and candidate donors , whereas the donors were situated proximal to the acceptors . we also calculated the binding capacity of network-derived motifs .

discussion
evidence supporting the recruitment of pre-existing cis-regulatory elements from non-photosynthetic genes into c <dig> genes
in the present study, we evaluated the possibility that a motif may have been recruited if it satisfies two criteria. first, this motif pre-exists in the neighboring genes surrounding an ortholog of a c <dig> photosynthetic gene in the rice genetic regulatory network; however, the orthologs of the c <dig> photosynthesis gene does not contain this motif. second, this motif appears in the c <dig> ortholog of this photosynthesis gene. based on these two criteria, we identified  <dig> out of the  <dig> bundle-sheath specific motifs to have been recruited during c <dig> emergence . in addition to these predicted bs-specific motifs, we further examined the recruitment of cis-regulatory elements previously identified through experimental approaches to be associated with cell-specific expression  <cit> , as well as motifs derived from gene regulatory networks. the results of these analyses also suggested a large-scale recruitment of pre-existing cis-regulatory elements from non-photosynthetic genes into c <dig> photosynthetic genes during c <dig> evolution .

evidence for the potential role of transposable element in the recruitment of c4-specific motifs
tes contribute to the interactions among various gene regulatory networks and the control the expression of genes  and lncrna  <cit> . these can potentially contain binding sites for tfs  <cit> . earlier work has suggested that about half of tf-binding sites are derived from tes in human and mouse  <cit> . tes may therefore contribute to the evolution of species-specific regulatory functions and phenotypes. in the present study, all seven putative recruited bsc-specific motifs were detected within the overlapping region of tes and the promoter regions of candidate donor gene . furthermore, these donors are located near the acceptors in one chromosome, suggesting that tes may have played an important role in the recruitment process. similar results were obtained for the experimentally validated motifs and network-derived motifs . similar to the function of tes in human and mouse  <cit> , the recruited motifs showed higher binding affinity to tfs. we hence propose that these putative recruited motifs might have contributed to the formation of new tf-binding sites and consequently modified the interactions among various gene regulatory networks in rice and maize. not all of the putative recruited motifs were presented within the overlapping regions of tes and the promoter regions of candidate donor genes , thereby suggesting other mechanisms for the emergence of these motifs during c <dig> evolution.

implications of transposon-driven recruitment of cis-regulatory elements to the evolution of c <dig> photosynthesis
c <dig> photosynthesis differs from c <dig> photosynthesis in various aspects, including recruitment of new decarboxylation enzymes, re-adjustment of nitrogen metabolism, starch metabolism, and partitioning of the photosynthetic enzymes or proteins into bundle sheath and mesophyll cells  <cit> . given these large number of differences between c <dig> and c <dig> photosynthesis, it is remarkable that c <dig> photosynthesis has independently emerged in more than  <dig> lineages  <cit> . furthermore, the emergence of c <dig> photosynthesis occurred within a relatively short geological period. this is because  <dig> million years ago, the global atmospheric co <dig> concentration dropped, and c <dig> photosynthesis started to show its competitive advantage over c <dig> photosynthesis  <cit> , thereby eventually resulting in c <dig> photosynthesis  <dig> million years later  <cit> . how can such a complex trait have evolved in such a short timeframe? this study provides new sequence-based evidences that recruitment of pre-existing motifs might have been a mechanism for c <dig> evolution, which in turn may have contributed to the rapid evolution of c <dig> photosynthesis.

furthermore, we showed that the new regulatory mechanism involving c <dig> photosynthesis might have been created through transposon-mediated motif movements. genome duplication has been regarded as a major mechanism responsible for the creation of material for neofunctionalization or creation of new genes during c <dig> emergence  <cit> . however, several recent analyses have shown that the copy number of c4-related genes are not necessarily higher than those in c <dig> species  <cit> . transposon-driven creation of new genes hence might have been used as an alternative mechanism for the creation of novel regulatory mechanisms for c4-related genes. furthermore, considering that during c <dig> evolution, not only those motifs from the promoter regions, but also those in the coding sequences were potentially recruited . therefore, transposons were utilized as ideal mechanism for the recruitment of regulatory motifs because these can mobilize elements without particular location preferences  <cit> . considering that there are relatively a lower number of whole genome duplication events during the evolution of land plants, this transposon-driven emergence of new genes might have been the predominant mechanism that has substantially contributed to the rapid evolution of new functions during the evolution of c <dig> photosynthesis of the low-co <dig> oligocene period  <cit> . additional experimental evidence is needed to test this potential mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has provided sequence-based evidence that suggests that transposon-mediated movement of motifs might have played a role in the formation of new cis-regulatory elements during the evolution of c <dig> photosynthesis. more experiments are needed to test this possibility. however, if this is true, then this may serve as a possible mechanism for the rapid emergence of c <dig> photosynthesis within a relatively short geological period during the oligocene  <cit> .
