BACKGROUND
in species devoid of complete genomic sequence information, libraries of bacterial artificial chromosome  clones  <cit>  are an indispensable genomic tool. the utility of bac libraries has been further enhanced by the development of high-information-content-fingerprinting  techniques  <cit>  and the fpc program for the assembly of fingerprinted bac clones into contigs  <cit> , which opened the door to the construction of bac-based physical maps of plant and animal genomes . an operation common to virtually all applications of bac libraries is screening the libraries for clones harboring specific nucleotide sequences. current screening techniques utilize either dna-dna hybridization or polymerase chain reaction . in some applications, such as the construction of a physical map, a bac library must be screened for the presence of hundreds or thousands of different molecular markers. to maximize the efficiency of such screening, multidimensional pooling of clones or probes is employed  <cit> ; probes are pooled if a library is screened by dna-dna hybridization  <cit>  and clones are pooled if it is screened by pcr  <cit> .

all current screening strategies are laborious, slow, error prone, and often result in ambiguous assignments of bac clones to loci on a genetic map. the identification of bac clones harboring specific nucleotide sequences by hybridization of multidimensional pools of overgo probes with bac library screening membranes  <cit> , in addition to some of the above problems, also requires handling large amounts of radioactive material. the greatest impediment to screening of bac libraries with pools of cdna clones or overgo probes is that a single probe often hybridizes with clones in multiple contigs, either due to gene duplication, the presence of repeated sequences, or other reasons. unequivocal assignment of bac clones to loci on the genetic map requires additional work.

we describe here a bac library screening strategy that is largely devoid of these limitations and can be performed in a high-throughput mode. the strategy employs illumina goldengate™ oligonucleotide assays, also referred to as oligonucleotide pool assays , that are currently used for the highly parallel snp genotyping of genomic dnas  <cit> . each assay targets a specific snp locus and utilizes two allele-specific oligonucleotides to discriminate between snp alleles. the allele discriminating nucleotide of an allele-specific oligonucleotide is at its 3' end. another primer, the locus-specific oligonucleotide, which contains an address sequence for the snp locus, anneals downstream of the snp. after annealing one of the two allele-specific oligonucleotides to the genomic dna template, the oligonucleotide is extended by dna polymerase and ligated to the locus-specific oligonucleotide downstream forming a contiguous pcr template. primer extension and ligation can be performed at up to  <dig> loci simultaneously. the templates are pcr amplified using three pcr primers complementary to specific sequences inserted into all oligonucleotides. two primers anneal to the allele-specific oligonucleotides; one for each snp is labeled with the cy <dig> fluorochrome and the other with the cy <dig> fluorochrome. the third anneals to the locus specific oligonucleotide. the ratio of the cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorescence is used to determine the genotype at a snp locus. if the ratio is near  <dig> or  <dig> , the locus is homozygous. if the ratio is about 1:  <dig> the locus is heterozygous.

it is shown here that annealing of allele- and locus-specific oligonucleotides to a pool of bac dnas and the subsequent primer extension and ligation reaction can be used to determine whether or not a bac pool dna harbors a specific locus. this allows genotyping the bac pool for the presence or absence of the locus. it is also shown that bac genotyping with illumina oligonucleotide assays results in a high percentage of unequivocal assignments of bac clones and bac contigs to loci on a genetic map.

a six-dimensional bac pooling strategy has previously been successfully used to genotype  <dig> sorghum bac clones  for the presence or absence of specific amplified fragment length polymorphism  amplicons during sorghum physical map construction  <cit> . the pooling strategy utilized  <dig> pools. although the six-dimensional strategy worked well for the sorghum genome, it results in too many pools for large genomes, such as those of wheat and its diploid ancestors. one genome equivalent of aegilops tauschii , one of the three diploid ancestors of polyploid wheat, amounts to  <dig> to  <dig> bac clones, depending on the average size of dna inserts. to facilitate screening multiple genome equivalents of large genomes, such as that of ae. tauschii, but keeping the numbers of pools manageably low, a simple, five-dimensional pooling strategy was designed and evaluated here.

contigs built from  <dig> ae. tauschii bac clones  <cit>  fingerprinted with the snapshot hicf technology  <cit>  were simultaneously screened with  <dig> multiplexed illumina goldengate assays. assignments of bac clones and contigs to gene loci on the ae. tauschii chromosome 2d genetic map were analyzed to assess the proportion of bac clones and contigs unequivocally assigned to individual loci on the genetic map.

RESULTS
genotyping of genomic dna and bac pool dna with illumina goldengate assays
genotyping of bac super-pools consisting of pooled bac plate-pools and containing dna of either  <dig> or  <dig> clones with an illumina goldengate assay is illustrated in figure  <dig>  using oligonucleotides designed for an a/g snp at locus be <dig>  in contrast to snp genotyping, the query in bac genotyping is whether or not an snp allele of ae. tauschii accession al8/ <dig>  is present in dna of a bac super-pool. bac super-pools containing bac clones harboring the al8/ <dig> target sequence are expected to show cy3/cy <dig> fluorescence  similar to that of plants homozygous for the al8/ <dig> genotype in the f <dig> population ; those that do not contain such a bac are expected to show no or residual fluorescence. super-pool dnas containing clones with the al8/ <dig> be <dig> allele  were within the call region  exported from the plot of the f <dig> plants genotyped with allele- and locus-oligonucleotides specific for be <dig> . bac super-pools with a null for the targeted be <dig> sequence showed only residual cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorescence, and their manhattan distance  from the origin  in the normalized polar coordinate plot placed them below the call area . because the fluorescence of these dnas was residual, their normalized theta did not cluster but ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  without defining the call areas on the basis of the previous clustering of the f <dig> plants , it would have been impossible to separate positive and negative super-pools from each other .

bac clone, bac contig and genetic locus correspondence
oligonucleotides for  <dig> ae. tauschii snps were designed and multiplexed but only  <dig> proved useful to interrogate dna of  <dig> ae. tauschii f <dig> plants because for  <dig> of them al8/ <dig> and as <dig> parents were monomorphic or were not homozygous. three distinct clusters , similar to those shown in fig. 1a, were obtained for  <dig> sets . the  <dig> snps were mapped at  <dig> est loci  on the ae. tauschii map . genotype call areas exported from these data were used to genotype bac super-pools into positive and negative clusters . all illumina assays that successfully clustered f <dig> genomic dnas also successfully clustered super-pools into positive and negative clusters.

contig locations of  <dig> bac clones detected with a subset of  <dig> illumina oligonucleotide assays were investigated . of these,  <dig> bac clones  were not present among the fingerprinted clones and were excluded from further consideration. clones detected with  <dig> illumina oligonucleotide assays were in single contigs . those detected with illumina oligonucleotide assays for loci be <dig>  bg <dig>  bq <dig>  be <dig>  and be <dig> were each in two contigs. contig pairs harboring clones detected with illumina assays for loci be <dig>  bg <dig> and bq <dig> could be merged into single contigs with fpc. the positive clones were neighbors in the reassembled contigs. five clones detected with the illumina oligonucleotide assay for marker be <dig> were in contigs ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> . the two contigs could be merged only above a sulston score of  <dig> × 10- <dig> and positive clone hb012i <dig> of ctg <dig> was separated by  <dig> clones from the group of positive clones present in ctg <dig>  both facts suggest that the two contigs are from different parts of the genome. hence, the illumina assay for locus be <dig> failed to generate unambiguous contig anchoring on the genetic map. a similar anchoring failure was observed for locus be <dig>  as nine bac clones identified by this oligonucleotide assay were assembled in two contigs  that could not be merged . overall, in the trial of  <dig> markers,  <dig> % of them resulted in a one-to-one relationship of clones in a contig to locus on the genetic map.

* clones not found among the fingerprinted clones used for contig assembly. ** the two successive contigs were merged with fpc.

new five-dimensional pooling strategy
the pooling strategy employed above included  <dig> × genome equivalents of bac clones. on average, between eight and nine bac clones are expected to harbor a target sequence in this genome coverage. if, e.g., there would be eight such clones in the super-pools and each would be present in a different 384-well plate, the clones may be in as many as eight plate rows and eight plate columns of the two dimensional grid, resulting in up to  <dig> row by column intersections. of these intersections, only eight harbor positive plate-pools; the remaining are false positive. the truly positive plate-pools can only be found by additional pcr as done above. this represents a lot of work if a library is screened with hundreds or thousands of markers.

this additional work would be reduced if screening could be limited to a 1× genome equivalent, each screened separately. in the ecori bac library, the 1× genome equivalent corresponded to about  <dig> 384-well plates.

to test empirically the efficacy of this 1× genome pooling strategy, the  <dig> super-pools  of 1× genome equivalent of the ecori library previously genotyped with  <dig> illumina oligonucleotide assays for loci mapped on ae. tauschii chromosome 2d were employed. the rps and cps were screened by pcr. the position of each positive clone was compared with the neighboring clones in the contig to determine if some of the neighboring clones were also positive with the same marker during the bac super-pool screening with illumina oligonucleotides described above. four  markers detected a single bac clone harboring a target sequence in the 1× genome equivalent . the remaining ten  detected either no clone or more than one clone resulting in two or more false-positive pools that had to be eliminated by an additional pcr .

* clones in bold were detected with illumina and pcr in the 1× genome equivalent of the ecori library. ** clones were detected but were not fingerprinted.

discussion
the illumina goldengate oligonucleotide assay, originally developed for high-throughput genotyping of snps, has been successfully adapted to genotyping of radiation hybrids  <cit> . it is shown here that the assay can also be used for the genotyping of bac multidimensional pools. while the query asked in snp genotyping is which of the two nucleotides is at an snp site, the query asked in bac pool genotyping is whether a target sequence is present or absent. in spite of this query difference, the high success rate characteristic for the illumina goldengate platform in genotyping snps was also achieved in bac pool genotyping .

it is shown here that bac pool genotyping is best performed in parallel with snp genotyping in order to generate well defined clusters for the sequences under investigation. this fact should be considered in the planning phase of a physical mapping project since bac libraries should ideally be constructed for one of the parents of the segregating population on which the genetic map will be based.

an important asset of illumina genotyping noted here is the one-to-one relationship between contigs and markers on the genetic map. in this study,  <dig> % of markers resulted in anchoring single contigs at single loci on the genetic map. for comparison, of  <dig> cdna clones used earlier as probes in hybridization with screening membranes of ae. tauschii libraries ,  <dig>  detected bac clones in single contigs and  <dig>  detected clones in two or more contigs. only the former clones could be considered anchored in this case. however, because only a subset of the clones was interrogated with cdna probes, a portion of the 43% apparent successes was based on a single clone hit. by definition, this can be in only a single contig. if the entire set of five libraries was hybridized with the cdna clones, the success rate would have been lower than 43%. similar ambiguities were observed in anchoring soybean hicf contigs by screening multidimensional bac library pools with ssrs  <cit> .

the multiplexed illumina oligonucleotide assays are most time and cost effective if large numbers of markers in large numbers of dnas are genotyped and if no additional work is needed to identify positive bac clones. a simple bac pooling strategy is suggested here that groups the clones into 1× genome equivalents, each treated independently during screening with the golden gate assay. this strategy maximizes the likelihood of only a single positive clone present among the bac pools and minimizes the need for an additional pcr to discriminate between positive and false positive pools if more then single positive bac is present among the pools. the theoretical probabilities of encountering  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  ... n positive clones during screening of a 1× genome equivalent follows a poisson distribution with μ =  <dig>  the probability of detecting only a single clone by screening 1× genome equivalents of clones is  <dig> %. if the effects of sampling are neglected, the empirical success rate is expected to be lower than the theoretical expectation because of occasional false negatives . this was borne out here, as the empirical rate of detecting a single clone by screening 1× genome equivalent bac clones was 27%. based on this empirical rate, a minimum of four 1× genome equivalents should be screened to detect at least one positive clone. four 1× genome equivalents for the ae. tauschii genome represent  <dig> pools. because the representation of a specific sequence in a bac library depends on the distribution of restriction sites, it is desirable to combine 1× genome equivalents from bac libraries generated with different restriction endonucleases, or utilize random bac libraries.

the library screening technique described here is time effective since it takes less than two weeks to screen five hundred dnas for  <dig> loci and only several weeks to process the data. the cost of screening bac libraries with goldengate assays is comparable or only slightly higher that the cost of overgo screening. however, the need for labor to resolve equivocal anchoring is greatly reduced with the goldengate assays. a factor that will likely limit the rate with which bac libraries can be screened and bac contigs anchored on a genetic map is the availability of sufficient numbers of single-copy snp loci for opa design. it is usually sufficient for anchoring of a contig on a genetic map to anchor a single locus per contig. contig assembly may produce up to  <dig>  to  <dig>  contigs in large plant genomes, and their anchoring will place high demands on the availability of sufficient numbers of single-copy snps. the new dna sequencing platforms will undoubtedly play a role in overcoming this potential rate limiting step.

CONCLUSIONS
while it has been possible to perform bac fingerprinting and the construction of genetic maps in high-throughput mode, bac contig anchoring on a genetic map has resisted scaling to high-throughput methods. this limitation is overcome with the illumina bac library screening and contig anchoring technique described here. these complementary, high-throughput techniques open the door to efficient construction of physical maps of virtually all eukaryotic genomes.
