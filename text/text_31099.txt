BACKGROUND
protein delivery is regarded as a safer and useful alternative to gene delivery for the induction of genome editing and alterations in the gene expression profile of cells. gene delivery through the transfection of plasmid dnas or viral transductions inevitably imposes potential complications to gene alteration and is subject to safety problems. in contrast, there is a slight possibility that a genome would be altered by proteins delivered directly into cells. furthermore, proteins become degraded and are eventually removed from cells. this property makes protein delivery more suitable for cell therapy applications in which a transient, rather than a sustained, action of transcription factors is required.

due to the impermeability of proteins through a nonpolar cell membrane, protein delivery typically requires a protein delivery vector. cell-penetrating peptides  have emerged as the most promising protein delivery vector and are distinct from liposomes and other encapsulation technologies. cpps are defined as short peptides  that facilitate the cellular uptake of large macromolecules with a low membrane permeability  <cit> . since the discovery that tat48– <dig> enables the hiv- <dig> tat protein to penetrate cells and activates hiv-1-specific target genes  <cit> , several cpps, including penetratin and transportan, have been reported. cpps are either arginine-rich, amphipathic, or hydrophobic  <cit> . recently, a cell-type-specific cpp, xentry, is found from the x-protein of the hepatitis b virus  <cit> . the arginine-rich cpps are short basic peptides highly enriched with arginine and lysine residues. the guanidinium groups of arginines play a central role in the cell penetrating activity of the arginine-rich cpps, and in fact, homooligomers of arginine  are significantly more effective than native arginine-rich cpps, such as tat48– <dig>  <cit> .

the different characteristics in the peptide sequences of cpps suggest that their translocation mechanisms are not identical. most importantly, the arginine-rich cpps are less toxic than the amphipathic cpps, and the arginine-rich cpps do not cause membrane leakage at low micromolar concentrations where the arginine-rich cpps are highly effective for cellular uptake  <cit> . considering their low toxicity and high efficiency, the arginine-rich cpps have been preferentially selected as protein delivery vectors. for example, the polyarginine fusion proteins of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc have been delivered into somatic cells to reprogram them into ipscs  <cit> , and tat-pdx <dig>  tat-ngn <dig>  and tat-mafa have been used to stimulate pancreatic β-cell differentiation  <cit> . moreover, r7-carm <dig> has been delivered to human mesenchymal stem cells to modulate their differentiation potential  <cit> .

the arginine-rich cpp proteins have been produced in e. coli as recombinant fusion proteins. however, the fusion of the arginine-rich cpps to proteins markedly decreases the solubility of the proteins, and when these are over-expressed in e. coli, they generally form the inclusion bodies. to obtain the soluble and active form of the proteins, the inclusion bodies have to be solubilized by denaturation agents, such as urea, and then the proteins have to be refolded  <cit> . alternatively, the temperature used to induce protein expression has to be lowered to maintain the solubility of the arginine-rich cpp proteins when expressed in e. coli  <cit> . however, either method severely decreases the efficiency of the recovery of the active proteins, which impedes the large-scale production of the arginine-rich cpp proteins from e. coli.

expressed protein ligation  is a semisynthetic technique that conjugates a synthetic peptide containing an n-terminal cysteine to a c-terminal thioester through a native chemical ligation reaction . a c-terminal thioester of a protein is generated by the thiolysis of a recombinant intein fusion protein expressed in e. coli. the orthogonal reactivity, the production of a native peptide bond, and the high yield in an aqueous buffer at neutral ph and low temperature make epl a powerful ligation method that introduces a synthetic peptide into recombinant proteins. epl has been used to incorporate unnatural amino acids, fluorophores, and post-translational modifications to proteins  <cit> . in this study, we employed epl to conjugate a synthetic polyarginine cpp polypeptide to a recombinant protein expressed in a soluble form in e. coli. the major advantage of this epl-based technique over the preparation of recombinant polyarginine cpp fusion proteins from e. coli is that the epl-based technique is not subject to the solubility problem as long as protein can be produced as soluble form in e. coli. in addition, the epl-based technique allows the preparation of cell-permeable proteins with novel arginine-rich cpps composed of unnatural amino acids, guanidinium-rich peptoids, or biotin.figure  <dig> 
general scheme for expressed protein ligation. in scheme  <dig>  the cre-thioester is isolated from the intein-his for further reaction with the thiol group of an n-terminal cysteine of the peptides. in scheme  <dig>  the thiolysis by mesna, the transthioesterification reaction, and the s-n acyl shift proceed in one-pot.



the applicability of the epl-based technique for the preparation of arginine-rich cpp proteins was previously tested using the enhanced green fluorescent protein  as a model protein  <cit> . the flow cytometry study showed that egfp conjugated with arginine 12-mer  prepared by the epl-based technique was delivered to cells with an efficiency comparable to that obtained with egfp-r <dig> expressed as a fusion protein in e. coli. however, the egfp-r <dig> molecules taken up by cells appeared to accumulate at the cell surface or be entrapped in endosomes, and it was uncertain whether these were delivered to the cytoplasm. the bio-activity of egfp-12r in the cells was not examined in the study.

the cre recombinase from bacteriophage p <dig> is a dna sequence-specific recombinase that catalyzes the recombination of dna between two loxp sites. cre has been widely used to generate a tissue-specific or inducible knockout in transgenic mice or conditional gene expression in cells. cre carries the nuclear localization sequence -like elements that direct the efficient entry of cre protein into the nucleus of mammalian cells  <cit> . in addition, cells harboring a loxp-stop-loxp reporter gene, such as β-galactosidase or egfp, allow us to monitor cre-mediated recombination by cre protein  <cit> . in this study, we prepared a cell-permeable cre protein through the conjugation of synthetic polyarginine cpps to recombinant cre expressed in e. coli using epl. the semisynthetic cre-r <dig>  prepared by epl had the similar enzymatic activity as cre. we found that sscre-r <dig> efficiently led to recombination events in living cells. it was previously reported that d-isomer polyarginine cpps are more efficient than l-isomer polyarginine cpps for the delivery of fluorescently labeled peptides  <cit> . biotin  is a water-soluble vitamin, and the strong biotin-avidin interaction allows imaging of the cells that uptake a biotin-containing protein. because epl allows the incorporation of d-isomer amino acids and peptide mimetics into a protein, we prepared cre proteins with the d-isomer of r <dig>  and biotin  by epl and explored whether these elaborations in the resulting cpp enhance the effectiveness of the intracellular delivery or allow cell imaging.

RESULTS
the cre-intein-his protein was expressed in e. coli and purified in its native form by ni2+-agarose column chromatography. we generated a cre-thioester by intein-mediated cleavage using mesna and then ligated the resultant cre-thioester with cgsgg-r <dig> or cgsgg-dr <dig> by native chemical ligation. to minimize any potential adverse effect of mesna on the activity of cre, we first performed the intein-mediated cleavage reaction with 50 mm mesna at 4°c for 24 h. under this condition, more than 95% of the cre-intein-his proteins were cleaved into cre and the intein-his . second, we explored the direct conversion of the cre-intein-his protein into the ligation product of cre-r <dig> through a two-step one-pot reaction . epl proceeds through the following three reactions; the intein-mediated cleavage reaction by thiol reagents, the transthioesterification reaction between the thiol group of an n-terminal cysteine of the peptides and the cre-thioester, and the spontaneous intramolecular s → n acyl shift that generates an amide bond at the ligation junction. the first two reactions are reversible, but the last reaction is irreversible. the irreversibility of the last amide-forming reaction allows the two-step one-pot reaction, in which the intein-mediated cleavage and the native chemical ligation proceed in one pot, resulting in a high yield of the final ligation product. we conducted the two-step one-pot epl reaction with 2 mg/ml cre-intein-his and a 10-fold excess of cgsgg-r <dig> in 50 mm mesna, 50 mm nah2po <dig>  and 250 mm nacl, ph  <dig>  at 4°c for 24 h. the intein-his proteins, mesna, and cgsgg-r <dig> were then removed from the final ligation product by ni2+-agarose column chromatography and subsequent gel filtration chromatography . cre-r <dig> migrates slowly compared to cre and forms the distinct up-shifted band on sds-page . conjugation efficiency was calculated from integrated peak areas of densitometry analysis of the coomassie-stained sds-page gels. typically, 84% of cre was conjugated into cre-r <dig>  and the final yield of cre-r <dig> was more than 2 mg from 20 mg of the cre-intein-his protein. we named the final cre-r <dig> product produced by epl as the semisynthetic cre-r <dig> .figure  <dig>

we next determined whether cre proteins retain their activity after the conjugation of r <dig> peptides by expressed protein ligation. control cre was generated from the cre-intein-his protein by intein-mediated cleavage with dtt instead of mesna. assays of the cre enzyme activity measured the release of a circular kmr from the linearized pgem-t with floxed-kmr by the site-specific recombination of cre . the maximum activity was observed at 80 ng/reaction for both the control cre and sscre-r <dig>  this finding demonstrates that the conjugation of cgsgg-r <dig> to cre by epl does not impair the enzymatic activity of cre.figure  <dig>

one major issue in developing a semisynthetic method to produce cell-permeable cre proteins is whether the functionalities of cell-permeable cre proteins are maintained during the semisynthetic process. human te <dig>  cells harbor a loxp-stop-loxp lacz reporter gene, which allows us to assess the cellular uptake, subcellular localization and enzymatic activity in the nucleus of cre proteins . in order for the transduced cre proteins to elicit recombination, the exogenous cre protein is required to enter the cell, translocate to the nucleus, and remove the stop sequence by recombination at two loxp sites. it results in the expression of lacz, and the cells expressing β-galactosidase turns blue in x-gal staining assay. the transfection of pbs185cmv-cre plasmid dna using lipofectamine induced recombination in 40% of cells . it indicates that cre proteins without any additional nls are able to enter the nucleus and elicit recombination in human te <dig> cells.figure  <dig> 
protein transduction of the semisynthetic cre-r <dig> and cre-dr <dig>   cre-mediated recombination of the floxed stop cassette leads to lacz expression in human te <dig>  cells.  the cells were exposed to varying doses of cre, sscre-r <dig>  sscre-dr <dig>  and tat-cre in opti-mem for 5 h. the cells were further incubated with the serum-containing media for a total of 48 h, and then the percentage of lacz-expressing cells was determined by x-gal staining . the pcmv-cre expression dna plasmid was transfected using lipofectamine.



when treated with the control cre , few lacz-expressing cells were observed . in contrast, treatment with sscre-r <dig> showed a dose-dependent increase in recombination. treatment with 80 μg/ml sscre-r <dig> induced recombination in 94% of cells. the ec50app value was measured to be  <dig>  μg/ml  . because 84% of cre was conjugated to cre-r <dig> in the sscre-r <dig> preparation , the ec50real of sscre-r <dig> was estimated to be  <dig>  μg/ml . tat-cre and cre-r <dig> purified as recombinant fusion proteins from e. coli are commercially available, and the ec <dig> of tat-cre was measured to be  <dig>  μg/ml  in a parallel experiment . transduction activity of cre-r <dig> appeared to be very low; the number of lacz-expressing cells obtained through the treatment of te <dig> cells with cre-r <dig> was too low to calculate the ec <dig> value. this result demonstrates that sscre-r <dig> is more or at least equally effective for intracellular delivery than the recombinant tat-cre or cre-r <dig> fusion protein. as reported for the recombinant tat-cre protein, the delivery of sscre-r <dig> into the cells was also rapid, and treatment with 60 μg/ml sscre-r <dig> for 1 h induced recombination in 65% of the cells . sscre-r <dig> was non-toxic to the cells at concentrations up to 160 μg/ml .table  <dig>

it has been shown that the d-isomer r <dig> peptide labeled with a fluorescent probe had a five-fold lower km value than the l-isomer r <dig> peptide for cellular uptake  <cit> . however, the cellular uptake mechanisms of cpps vary depending on the size and nature of the cargos  <cit> , and it has not been rigorously examined yet whether the d-isomer polyarginine cpps works better than the l-isomer polyarginine cpps for the delivery of large-size protein cargos  <cit> . in this study, we conjugated cgsgg-dr <dig> to cre by epl and produced sscre-dr <dig> with a similar conjugation efficiency, purity, and overall yield as sscre-r <dig>  to compare the abilities of sscre-r <dig> and sscre-dr <dig> to enter cells, we treated human te <dig>  cells with sscre-r <dig> and sscre-dr <dig> and scored the recombination events based on the transduced cre proteins . at concentrations less than 20 μg/ml, sscre-r <dig> and sscre-dr <dig> were equally non-effective. however, the dose-dependent increase in recombination obtained with sscre-dr <dig> was steeper than that obtained with sscre-r <dig>  and the ec50app values for sscre-dr <dig> and sscre-r <dig> were  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively . we consistently observed that the ec <dig> of sscre-dr <dig> was at least 10% lower than that of sscre-r <dig>  although the difference in the ec <dig> values between sscre-dr <dig> and sscre-r <dig> was not as marked as the difference in the km values between the d-isomer r <dig> peptide and the l-isomer r <dig> peptide. wender et al. measured the initial rates of cellular uptake of the peptides at 3°c for 240 s by facs after trypsin treatment  <cit> , and this method cannot differentiate the peptides delivered to the cytosol from those incorporated into the plasma membrane or trapped in endosomes. these differences in the assay methods and in the size and nature of the cargos may explain the discrepancy in the extents of the effects of the d-isomer on the efficiency of cellular uptake. nonetheless, these results clearly demonstrate that the d-isomer polyarginine is more efficient than the l-isomer polyarginine even for the delivery of large-size protein cargos.

the guanidinium group of arginine-rich cpps forms a bidentate bond with the negative-charged lipid components of a membrane and generates a negative gaussian membrane curvature, which induces the temporal and dynamic topological transformation of the membrane structure to the mesh phase  <cit> . cpps have been proposed to translocate into the inside surface of a membrane via an adaptive translocation during this phase transition. therefore, the engineering of the membrane curvature may be a strategy for the promotion of the cellular uptake of cpps. indeed, it was found that epsin n-terminal peptide 1– <dig> , a peptide that induces a positive curvature, accelerates the translocation of r <dig> peptides into cells  <cit> . however, the effect of membrane curvature on the cellular uptake of cpps with large-size protein cargos has not yet been examined. in this study, we treated human te <dig>  cells with sscre-r <dig> and sscre-dr <dig> in the presence of epn <dig> and scored the recombination events . epn <dig> promotes recombination in a dose-dependent manner when used at a concentration near the ec <dig> of sscre-r <dig> or sscre-dr <dig>  40 μg/ml. the acceleration effect of epn <dig> started to be observed at 10 μm, and recombination was observed in 91% of cells exposed to 80 μm epn <dig> and 40 μg/ml sscre-dr <dig>  the acceleration effect of epn <dig> was also observed in the cells treated with a suboptimal concentration of sscre-r <dig> and sscre-dr <dig>  20 μg/ml. in this case, however, the acceleration effect of epn <dig> became obvious at higher concentrations, such as  <dig> and 80 μm. taken together, these results demonstrate that epn <dig> is able to promote the cellular uptake of polyarginine cpps with large-size protein cargos. because epn <dig> is not toxic to cells  <cit> , epn <dig> may be useful as a booster for the protein transduction of sscre-r <dig> or sscre-dr <dig> to cell types that are not amenable to protein transduction.figure  <dig>

the visualization of the cells transduced with therapeutic cell-permeable proteins will be highly advantageous for post-treatment evaluation. as the first step to explore this possibility, we synthesized dr9-biotin  and conjugated dr9-biotin to cre by epl. sscre-dr9-biotin was produced with a similar purity and overall yield as sscre-dr <dig>  we found little difference in the transduction efficiency between sscre-dr <dig> and sscre-dr9-biotin. to visualize the sscre-dr9-biotin delivered into cells, the cells were treated with sscre-dr9-biotin for 5 h, washed with pbs, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and then stained with avidin-fitc. images taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining with a distinct pattern . a previous study raised the possibility that cell fixation leads to the artifactual redistribution of cpp  <cit> . therefore, it is unlikely that sscre-dr9-biotin has the same subcellular localization in living cells demonstrated by avidin-fitc staining in this study. nonetheless, these results clearly demonstrated the applicability of epl for the preparation of cell-permeable proteins with biotin for cell imaging. for in vivo imaging of whole animals or cells, it will be more advantageous to use cpps with fluorophores instead of biotin. it will be interesting to devise a near-infrared  fluorophore that can be located near cpp without hampering the delivery and activity of proteins in cells.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we devised an epl-based technique to conjugate synthetic polyarginine cpps to cre protein expressed in e. coli without impairing the enzymatic activity of cre. the ligation product, sscre-r <dig>  exhibited comparable or even better transduction activity compared with the recombinant tat-cre and cre-r <dig> fusion proteins directly expressed in e. coli. because all of the steps of epl are designed to proceed in the presence of high salt concentrations, this approach avoids the technical hurdle caused by the decrease in the solubility of polyarginine fusion proteins when expressed in e. coli. in addition, this epl-based technique allowed us to prepare sscre-dr <dig> and sscre-dr9-biotin containing poly-d-arginine and biotin as part of the cpps. sscre-dr <dig> resulted in improved protein transduction compared with cre-r <dig>  and sscre-dr9-biotin allowed the visualization of the cells transduced with sscre-dr9-biotin. the findings demonstrated the feasibility of this epl-based technique for the preparation of cell-permeable proteins with higher transduction efficiency and more elaborate properties for use in more sophisticated applications, such as cell imaging. epl should find broad use for the introduction of cell permeability to therapeutic proteins, such as transcription factors or antibodies.
