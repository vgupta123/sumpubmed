BACKGROUND
after it infects host e. coli cells, bacteriophage λ follows either of two fates, lytic or lysogenic. how the virus decides which pathway to follow after infection depends upon a complex genetic circuit. an increase in the number of infecting phages converts the decision making process from a deterministic to a stochastic one, with the cell fate depending on the number of phages deciding in favour of lysogeny  <cit> . there are phage coded proteins and transcription factors  <cit>  dedicated for this decision making process, but host factors are also involved  <cit> . mutations in the ci, cii and ciii genes of λ  <cit>  enhances the lytic frequency  and therefore the products of these genes were thought to be responsible for the establishment of lysogeny. cii, the key tetrameric transcription factor for lysogenic establishment, is a very unstable protein  <cit>  and its presence in sufficient amounts is crucial for the lysogenic choice  <cit> . other factors such as λciii and the host hfl proteins that influence the lysis-lysogeny switching affect the stability of cii in one way or the other. λciii promotes lysogeny by acting as a general inhibitor of e. coli hflb that degrades cii  <cit> .

mutations in the host hfl loci cause an infecting λ particle to follow the lysogenic mode. these genes therefore encode factors that somehow destabilize cii. primarily from mutational studies, two such loci, hfla and hflb, were initially identified. the product of the latter gene, hflb, is an atp-dependent metalloprotease known as a 'quality control' protease that removes misfolded proteins produced due to rapid translation during good nutrient conditions  <cit> . cii is also a substrate of hflb  <cit>  and thus acts as a sensor for cellular nutrient conditions of the host. rapid degradation of cii in cells growing in rich media thus favors the lytic development  <cit> . the hfla locus consists of the genes hflx, hflk and hflc that are under the control of the same promoter  <cit> . of these, hflx has been demonstrated to have no role in lambda lysogeny  <cit> . the products of the other two, hflk and hflc, are tightly associated with each other and copurify as the 'hflkc' complex, which was earlier thought to be a protease  <cit> . subsequently, hflkc was found only to act as a 'modulator' of hflb by forming a complex with the latter  <cit> . the only other known e. coli factor in this process, hfld  <cit> , has been shown to inhibit cii-mediated activation of transcription by impairing the dna-binding ability of cii  <cit> .

hflkc antagonizes the action of hflb towards the membrane associated substrates of the latter  <cit> . the behavior of hflkc with respect to the cytosolic substrates of hflb , however, remains unclear. likewise, the role of hflkc in the lysis-lysogeny decision of λ is not well understood. though an 'hfl' protein, mutations in whose gene causes an increase in the lysogenic frequency of λ  <cit> , the deletion of these genes has little effect on the in vivo stability of exogenous cii  <cit> . cii expressed from a plasmid is found to be stabilized in an hflkc-deleted cell, only if the host is simultaneously infected with a lambda phage  <cit> . on the other hand, e. coli cells overexpressing hflkc exhibit an enhanced frequency of lysogenization  <cit> . these results lead to a paradox: lysogeny increases both upon deletion or overexpression of hflkc. therefore, the role of hflkc in the λ lysis-lysogeny switch merits further investigations.

methods
plasmids, bacterial strains and phages
plasmid pqkc was constructed by pcr cloning of the hflk and hflc orfs  between the bamhi and sali sites of pqe <dig> . construction of pkp <dig>  has been described earlier  <cit> . plasmid pc2c <dig>  was constructed in three steps. first, the ndei-bamhi fragment of pab <dig> containing the ciii gene  <cit>  was cloned into pkp <dig>  <cit>  and was named placiii . then the bglii-xhoi fragment of placiii  was cloned into the compatible bamhi-xhoi sites of pkp <dig>   <cit> . the resulting plasmid was named plac2c <dig>  in the final step the bamhi-bglii fragment of plac2c <dig>  was cloned into the linearized arm of pk <dig>   <cit>  at the bglii site.

for wild type e. coli, the strain mg <dig>  was used. the strain ak <dig>  <cit>   served as cells with mutant hflkc.

the phage strain λciii <dig> was used as the ciii-defective phage. in this strain, a g to t mutation in the 23rd nucleotide of the ciii orf leads to an alternative structure of the ciii mrna that is incapable of translation  <cit> . this is one of the most effective ciii mutants  <cit>  and has been used as ciii- by many workers.

purification of proteins
for the purification of the hflkc complex, xl1blue cells carrying pqkc was used and  <dig> μg/ml of ampicillin was used for selection.  <dig>  ml of the overnight saturated culture was inoculated into  <dig> ml of fresh m <dig> medium with the appropriate antibiotic and allowed to grow on a 37°c shaker incubator till the culture o.d.  was  <dig> - <dig> . the culture was then cooled to 18°c and induced by  <dig> μm iptg, followed by further growth at 18°c with constant shaking  for  <dig> hours. after induction, bacterial cells were recovered by centrifugation at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes in sorvall rc5c, using an sa <dig> rotor, at 4°c. the medium was decanted out and the pellet was washed with  <dig> % nacl and dissolved in  <dig> ml of lysis buffer  and  <dig> μg/ml lysozyme). cells were then lysed by sonication with  <dig> pulses , followed by centrifugation at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. the supernatant was collected into a fresh tube and loaded on to a ni+2-nta column, pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer. after loading, the column was washed with wash buffer . proteins were eluted from the column using the elution buffer . imidazole was removed by dialysis in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm kcl, 10% glycerol,  <dig> % np40).

native cii  <cit>  and gst-hflb  <cit>  were purified as described earlier.

in vitro proteolysis of cii
hflb mediated proteolysis of cii was carried out in buffer p . atp was added to a concentration of  <dig> mm in all the reaction mixtures.  <dig> μm of cii was taken with  <dig> μm of purified gst-hflb in a  <dig> μl reaction mix. the reactions were incubated at 37°c for the specified time intervals followed by the addition of sds-page loading buffer and heating in a boiling water bath for  <dig> minutes. the samples were analyzed on a 15% sds-page. the effect of hflkc on the proteolysis of cii was observed by the addition of his-hflkc  to gst-hflb prior to the addition of cii. the band corresponding to cii was quantitated by volume analysis  quantity-1) and used as the amount of cii remaining  after the specified time.

in vivo proteolysis of cii
in vivo proteolysis of cii was carried out in e. coli mg <dig> cells  transformed with pkp <dig> or pc2c <dig>  both of which contained cii under lac promoter. in addition, pc2c <dig> contained ciii under a second lac promoter. cells carrying pkp <dig> or pc2c <dig> were inoculated in  <dig> ml of lb medium supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin. expression of cii was induced by  <dig> mm iptg after the o.d. of the culture  had reached  <dig> . the culture was further grown at 37°c for another  <dig> minutes, followed by the addition of  <dig> μg/ml spectinomycin to arrest further protein synthesis. samples were taken out at regular intervals after spectinomycin addition, and immediately centrifuged to pellet the cells.  <dig> μl of sterile water and  <dig> μl of sds gel loading dye were added to each sample, followed by immediate boiling and loading onto a 15% sds-page. the gel was transferred to a pvdf membrane  and was blotted with anti-cii antibody. each cii band was quantitated by volumetric analysis as described above.

the effect of overexpression of hflkc was observed by transformation of mg <dig> cells by plasmid pqkc . the transformed cells were grown in the presence of both kanamycin and ampicillin. promoters in both the plasmids are inducible with iptg. the effect of deletion of hflkc was observed by transformation of ak <dig> cells by pkp <dig> or pc2c <dig> 

for measurement of the stability of cii under conditions of infection by λciii <dig>  mg <dig> or ak <dig> cells carrying pkp <dig> were grown in luria broth supplemented with  <dig> % maltose and were infected with the phage ,  <dig> minutes after the addition of iptg. spectinomycin was added after another  <dig> minutes to ensure the entry of phage dna and the expression of phage factors. samples were then taken out at regular intervals and analyzed as described above.

assay of plaque morphology
the plaque morphology of λciii <dig> was assayed in e. coli mg <dig> , in mg <dig> cells carrying pqkc, and in strain ak <dig> . cells were grown up to an o.d.  of  <dig>  in luria broth supplemented with  <dig> % maltose, and were induced with  <dig> μm iptg. a bacterial lawn was made by pouring  <dig> ml of soft top agar  mixed with  <dig> μl of these cells onto a 2% luria agar plate. another  <dig> μl of the above liquid culture was infected with λciii <dig> at an m.o.i. of  <dig> . it was further incubated at 32°c for  <dig> minutes to allow adsorption of the phage. appropriate dilutions were then plated onto the prepared bacterial lawn and the plates were incubated overnight at 32°c. the turbidity of plaques formed in ak <dig> cells or in cells overexpressing hflkc were compared with the clear plaques formed in wild type cells upon infection by λciii <dig> 

RESULTS
role of hflkc on the proteolysis of cii in vivo
e. coli hflkc inhibits the proteolysis of all the membranous substrates of hflb   <cit> . however, the behaviour of hflkc toward λcii, a cytosolic substrate, is perplexing. the deletion of hflkc as well as its overexpression causes an increase in the lysogenic frequency of λ  <cit> . the hflkc genes were first identified as mutants that caused turbid plaques of λ on a bacterial lawn  <cit> . it is therefore expected that cii would be stabilized in an hflkc-deleted host cell. kihara et al.  <cit> , however, showed that the deletion of hflkc has little effect on the stability of cii cloned under an arabad promoter. we obtained similar results when the effect of hflkc deletion  on the stability of cii  was tested . here we measured the stability of cii expressed from the plasmid pkp <dig> in wild type and in ak <dig>  cells. in both cases, cii was unstable. we also tested the effect of overexpression of hflkc from a second plasmid , and found that in this case, cii expressed from pkp <dig> was stabilized . this data is consistent with in vitro results that showed that purified hflkc  <cit>  inhibits the proteolysis of cii. the inhibitory activity is an intrinsic property of hflk and hflc, since hflk or hflc can individually inhibit the proteolysis of cii  <cit> .

these results pose an intriguing question. why does the deletion of an inhibitor of cii proteolysis promote lysogeny? one can think of the following possibilities:  a proper assembly of hflb that is necessary for its activity against cytosolic substrates, may require hflkc; or  in the absence of hflkc, hflb is guided towards its membrane-associated substrates  <cit> , indirectly stabilizing the cytosolic substrate cii. however, from in vivo proteolysis experiments we found that in ak <dig> cells , exogenous cii was not stabilized , confirming that hflb was active against cii even in the absence of hflkc. this result rules out both the possibilities mentioned above. it may be noted that similar results were also obtained by kihara et al  <cit> . therefore, an increase in lambda lysogeny upon overexpression of host hflkc  <cit>  is not at all surprising, since hflkc inhibits the proteolysis of cii.

effect of increasing concentrations of hflkc on the proteolysis of cii in vitro
the paradoxical effect of an increase in the lysogenic frequency of λ upon deletion as well as overexpression of hflkc has been reported  <cit> . a possible reason behind this paradox could be that a critical molar ratio between hflb and hflkc, believed to be 1: <dig> in wild type cells  <cit> , is necessary for a proper proteolysis of cii by hflb. both the increase or decrease of hflkc would offset this critical ratio and could lead to a stabilization of cii, promoting lysogeny. to examine this possibility, we carried out the proteolysis of cii by hflb in vitro, in the presence of three different concentrations of hflkc . in the first case, when hflkc was absent , cii  was rapidly cleaved by hflb. the rate of proteolysis was much slower when hflkc was added in a molar ratio of hflkc:hflb = 1: <dig>  the proteolysis was inhibited further when hflkc was added in excess . if the above hypothesis was true, proteolysis of cii should have been maximum at a molar ratio of 1: <dig>  therefore we conclude that hflkc acts as a simple inhibitor of cii proteolysis and the stabilization of cii in the absence of hflkc may involve other factors.

role of hflkc on in vivo proteolysis of cii: the effect of ciii
deletion of hflkc genes lead to an increase in the lysogenic frequency of λ. nevertheless, the stability of cloned cii remained unaffected in Δhflkc cells. an interesting phenomenon, however, was observed in Δhflkc cells that were infected by λ. cii expressed from a plasmid was stabilized in these cells  <cit> . thus it appears that some additional factors, supplied by the infecting phage, caused a stabilization of cii in the absence of hflkc. the only known phage factor that favors lysogeny by inhibiting the proteolysis of cii by hflb, is ciii  <cit> . we therefore tested the possible involvement of ciii as the λ factor responsible for the above result, viz. stabilization of cii in λ-infected Δhflkc cells.

we sought to supply λciii instead of the whole phage in an hflkc-deleted host and investigate its effect on the proteolysis of cloned cii. for this purpose, we cloned ciii in tandem behind cii in the same plasmid and inserted it in a host with deleted  or overexpressed hflkc. cii was indeed stabilized in these cells, even without simultaneous infection by λ . therefore it appears that infection by λ stabilized cii in Δhflkc cells because it supplied ciii.

ciii is a general inhibitor of cii proteolysis  <cit> . it is therefore expected that between a wild type strain alone and one that carries ciii, cii would exhibit a greater stability in the latter. a comparison of figures  <dig> and  <dig>  shows that this is indeed the case. nonetheless, a greater stability of cii in Δhflkc cells compared to wild type  is surprising, since the absence of hflkc does not affect the stability of cii. ciii is itself a substrate of hflb  <cit> . if hflkc facilitated the proteolysis of ciii, the above effect could be explained by the preferential stabilization of ciii in Δhflkc cells. however, there was no difference in the in vitro proteolysis of ciii by hflb in the presence or absence of purified hflkc . therefore the role of ciii in this paradoxical effect is indirect.

are there additional λ factors that influence the lysis-lysogeny decision?
if ciii was the only factor responsible for the stabilization of cii in Δhflkc cells, infection with a ciii-defective phage would produce clear plaques in a Δhflkc host. we tested this possibility by infecting both ak <dig>  cells and hflkc-overexpressing cells with lambda ciii <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, turbid plaques were obtained in each case, unlike the clear plaques produced in wild type e. coli . this result is really surprising as ciii - phage always produces clear plaques. since ciii and hflkc both inhibit the proteolysis of cii, it is also surprising that the absence of both leads to increased lysogeny.

is it then possible that enhancement of lysogeny can occur through a different mechanism that does not involve the stabilization of cii? increase in lambda lysogeny is invariably linked to the stability of cii in all published reports to date. can the two phenomena be delinked in some special case such as a Δhflkc host? we tested this possibility by measuring the stability of cloned cii in wild type and Δhflkc cells, both infected with λciii <dig>  a greater stabilization of cii occurred in Δhflkc cells . therefore, an increase in the lysogenic frequency indeed requires the stabilization of cii.

this enhanced stabilization of cii is observed only under conditions of phage infection, even when ciii is nonfunctional. therefore in addition to ciii, there could be another as yet unidentified factor in λ that increases the stability of cii and hence, promotes lysogeny . the presence of such a cii-stabilizing factor  can only be demonstrated in hflkc-deleted cells. therefore, the activities of csf and hflkc must have some connections . likewise, ciii and hflkc are likely to be connected as well. the different outcomes for deletion or overexpression of hflkc on lysogeny as well as on the stability of cii under various conditions are summarized in figure 5a.

the unknown factor csf could have been a non-protein factor  and lambda dna would have been a good candidate for the same, since cii may be stabilized by binding to its cognate promoter. however, in our in vivo experiments, the plasmid pkp <dig>  contained the promoter sequence pe, ruling out such a possibility.

stabilization of cii in cells overexpressing hflkc is not surprising since hflkc is an inhibitor of cii-proteolysis. it is worthwhile to note that the effect of hflkc deletion is epistatic over the effect of ciii deletion, since even the absence of ciii cannot produce clear plaques in a Δhflkc host. it is possible that ciii  works better in the absence of hflkc . therefore cii is better stabilized under these conditions and produces turbid plaques in Δhflkc cells. ci, cii and ciii were first described as phage mutations which led to clear plaques in a wild type host. on the other hand, λ gives very turbid plaques in a Δhflkc host. our study thereby raises the possibility of finding novel phage mutations that would give clear plaques in an hflkc-deleted host.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  e. coli hflkc inhibits the proteolysis of λcii by hflb and hence the overexpression of the former results in an increase in the lysogenic frequency.

 <dig>  in the absence of hflkc, λcii is stabilized upon infection by ciii-defective λ, suggesting the presence of a yet unidentified phage factor csf .
