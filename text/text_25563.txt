BACKGROUND
injury in the central nervous system  is generally accompanied by an inflammatory reaction that involves mainly microglia and astrocytes. the latter are the most abundant cells in the cns and their contribution to the pathological outcome is still a matter of debate. in response to injury, cytokines and chemokines trigger astrocyte proliferation and migration into the lesioned area where astrocytes contribute to the formation of the glial scar that inhibits axonal regeneration in the cns  <cit> . characteristic features of reactive astrocytes are morphological changes with cell body hypertrophy and increased expression of a number of proteins absent or weakly expressed in their resting state. among these proteins, the mmps and the timps are highly upregulated in reactive astrocytes. timp- <dig> is a  <dig> kda multifunctional secreted glycoprotein that possesses, in addition to its mmp inhibitor activity, growth promoting activities in a number of non neural cells  <cit> . we first demonstrated that timp- <dig> is massively and sequentially upregulated in cortical areas of rat brain after kainate-induced seizures, first in resistant neurons and subsequently in reactive astrocytes  <cit> . selective timp- <dig> upregulation in astrocytes has also been reported after experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  <cit>  or cerebral ischemia  <cit> . interestingly, none of the aforementioned studies reported timp- <dig> expression in reactive microglial cells, highlighting the possibility of a specific role for timp- <dig> in astrocytes among glial cells. in cultured astrocytes, timp- <dig> is induced in response to a number of pro-inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines activated in the injured brain such as tnf-α or il-1β˙

we provide evidence that the absence of timp- <dig> prevents the induction of mmp- <dig> and of inflammatory markers such as icam- <dig> or mcp- <dig> after fas activation and that the mutant astrocytes proliferate less than the wild type in response to cytokines and to timp- <dig>  timp- <dig> null mutation is also accompanied by an increased constitutive expression of gelatinases, mainly mmp- <dig>  altogether, these data indicate that the absence of timp- <dig> specifically attenuates the inflammatory response of astrocytes triggered by fas but not by tnf-α and suggest that the mmp/timp balance is an important determinant in the pro-inflammatory effects of some members of the tnf family.

RESULTS
characterisation of astrocyte cultures
astrocyte cultures were characterised as being greater than 95% pure by counting gfap positive cells over the total number of cells stained by hoechts #  <dig>  microglial cells stained with f4/ <dig> constituted the majority of gfap negative cells . we confirmed by western blot that wt astrocytes constitutively expressed timp- <dig> and that the protein was absent in astrocytes from ko mice . as shown in fig. 1c, no morphological differences were observed between astrocytes from wt or ko mice and the density of confluent cells was equivalent. this observation was supported by the finding that the mtt levels were identical in untreated wt and timp- <dig> ko cultures. parallel experiments using propidium iodide as a cell death marker showed no differences in the constitutive cell death of untreated astrocytes  between wt and mutant mice . we found a mild reduction  in mitochondrial activity by the test mtt only in wt astrocytes treated by tnf-α and no effect after anti-fas antibody exposure . we confirmed previous data  <cit>  demonstrating the absence of anti-fas toxicity in astrocytes.

timp- <dig> null mutation causes altered expression of mmp- <dig> and mmp-9
it is widely accepted that astrocytes express soluble mmp- <dig> and  <dig>  and timp- <dig>  as timp- <dig> is the preferential inhibitor of mmp- <dig> and a good inhibitor of mmp- <dig>  we used gel zymography to evaluate whether timp- <dig> depletion would influence the expression of both proteinases in the supernatants of wt and ko cultures after treatments. in control cultures, gel zymography  revealed the expected mmp- <dig>  <dig> kda band, and a predominant band at  <dig> kda and a weaker band at  <dig> kda, both of them coherent with expected molecular weights for mmp- <dig> active forms. we also detected a conspicuous band at  <dig> kda. the constitutive levels of mmp- <dig> were more than twice the levels of mmp- <dig> in both wt and mutant astrocytes. timp- <dig> null mutation had no significant effect on constitutive mmp- <dig> expression, but increased the baseline levels of mmp- <dig> by 60%, as compared with wt astrocytes . in the latter, tnf-α and fas activation significantly increased mmp- <dig> expression . in the ko astrocytes, mmp- <dig> levels were upregulated only after exposure to tnf-α, while fas activation had no significant effect . treatments did not change the levels of mmp- <dig> except the anti-fas antibody which reduced mmp- <dig> levels in ko astrocytes. when considering the total pool of gelatinases detected by gel zymography, we found that its constitutive level was higher in the ko astrocytes and increased with tnf-α and anti-fas antibody in the wt astrocytes . phenanthroline and bb- <dig> abolished gelatinase activity, indicating that it was generated by metalloproteinases .

icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> are differentially induced in wt and timp- <dig> ko astrocytes
astrocytes are the most abundant cells of the brain and express cytokines and adhesion molecules involved in different phases of neuroinflammation, including leukocyte recruitment in the cns. among these proteins, icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> are strongly up-regulated during neuroinflammation, and preferentially in astrocytes  <cit> . accordingly, both proteins are considered as markers of inflammatory response. in addition, the activities of icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> are modulated by metalloproteinases  <cit> . for these reasons we examined whether the imbalance in the mmp/timp ratio observed in the mutant cultures would affect the levels of icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> in astrocytes. as illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we found no differences in the constitutive expression of membrane bound icam- <dig> or release of mcp- <dig> between wt and ko cultures. however, exposure to tnf-α increased icam- <dig> levels in both wt and ko cultures  . an even higher upregulation of mcp- <dig> levels was observed after tnf-α in wt  and ko  . in contrast, fas activation upregulated icam- <dig>  and mcp- <dig>  levels only in wt mice, but not in timp- <dig> deficient astrocytes.

ko astrocytes proliferate less than wt astrocytes in response to tnf-α and anti-fas
since cell proliferation is a hallmark of glial response to neuroinflammatory challenge, we measured the incorporation of 3h-thymidin, as an index of proliferation, into first passage synchronised astrocytes in response to cytokines and mrtimp- <dig> . we show that mrtimp- <dig> induced the highest increase  in proliferation of wt cells. even though the levels of 3h-thymidin uptake in ko astrocytes treated with timp- <dig> were equivalent to those of wt astrocytes, statistical significance with respect to the untreated ko control was not reached, possibly because of a high level of constitutive 3h-thymidin incorporation in the mutant astrocytes. tnf-α did not significantly stimulate 3h-thymidin uptake in wt and ko astrocytes, unlike anti-fas antibody that induced a significant 40% increase in wt but not in ko astrocytes.

effect of wt and ko astrocytes on lymphocyte recruitment
mcp- <dig> is one of the main chemokines involved in the chemoattraction of monocytes and lymphocytes under inflammatory conditions  <cit> . we investigated whether wt astrocytes showing a dramatic upregulation of mcp- <dig> after exposure to tnf-α or anti-fas antibody, would differentially affect lymphocyte migration as compared with ko astrocytes whose levels of mcp- <dig> were unaltered by anti-fas antibody treatment. the data  show that astrocytes alone increased by 300% the number of migrating lymphocytes regardless of the genotype. moreover, in the absence of astrocytes, anti-fas antibody alone was sufficient to significantly increase  lymphocyte migration. however, the incubation of astrocytes with tnf-α increased the chemotaxis of lymphocytes, in particular in the ko astrocytes. in contrast, no effect of anti-fas antibody was observed in wt or ko astrocytes as compared to their controls.

discussion
the present report shows that timp- <dig> null mutation attenuates the inflammatory response of astrocytes to fas activation. we show that timp- <dig> null mutation is associated with a higher constitutive mmp- <dig> expression, and that fas activation fails to induce mmp- <dig>  icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> expression in ko astrocytes as it is the case in wt astrocytes. moreover, ko astrocytes proliferate less than wt in response to anti-fas and mrtimp- <dig>  whereas recruitment of lymphocytes is significantly induced only by tnf-α-treated astrocytes from ko mice.

the constitutive expression of gelatinases in general, and mmp- <dig> in particular, is higher in ko than in wt astrocytes, suggesting that in the absence of timp- <dig>  the baseline regulation of one of its main targets is altered. the overall increase in gelatinase expression along with the absence of timp-1-mediated inhibition of mmps in mutant astrocytes presumably increases mmp activity. as demonstrated previously in other cell types  <cit>  and in brains from timp- <dig> ko mice  <cit> , we assume that timp- <dig> deficiency is not compensated by the overexpression of other timps, at least at the mrna level. our data showing a weak decrease of the mitochondrial activity after tnf-α exposure could be interpreted as a mild cytotoxic effect in agreement with studies reporting <20% astrocyte cell death after exposure to the cytokine  <cit> . we can not rule out the possibility that the absence of cell death under tnf treatment in ko astrocytes may be actually related to a relatively higher baseline proliferative potential in these cultures. we also show that astrocytes are resistant to fas-mediated cell death in keeping with previous findings in human  <cit>  and mouse astrocyte cultures  <cit> . moreover, the tnf-α mediated induction of mmp- <dig> found in mouse astrocytes was equivalent to that reported in rat astrocytes  <cit> . however, this is the first report demonstrating that the activation of fas stimulates mmp- <dig> release by astrocytes. together, these data support the idea that the activation of receptors of the tnf superfamily triggers inflammatory rather than death signals in astrocytes, and that mmp- <dig> could act as an inflammatory factor downstream of fas activation. it is likely that the induced expression of mmp- <dig> amplifies the inflammatory cascade initiated by cytokines through mechanisms involving the proteolytic activation of latent forms of cytokines. mmp- <dig> can proteolytically convert latent forms of tnf-α and il-1β into active forms  <cit> . the presumably pro-inflammatory role of mmp- <dig> in astrocytes does not preclude its cytotoxic action demonstrated for cortical  <cit>  and hippocampal  <cit>  neurons in excitotoxic/inflammatory paradigms.

the most striking finding of the present study was the reduced response displayed by timp- <dig> deficient astrocytes to anti-fas antibody, in clear contrast with the response of their wt counterparts. failure in inducing mmp- <dig>  icam- <dig> and mcp- <dig> strongly suggests that the absence of timp- <dig> disturbs the fas signal transduction pathway. timps are considered as multifunctional proteins with anti-mmp, cell-death/survival, and growth promoting activities  <cit> . some of the mechanisms underlying these actions are related with the ability of timps to prevent proteolytic processing of membrane receptors, such as death receptors of the tnf superfamily. it has been suggested that the stabilisation of fas by endogenous  and synthetic mmp inhibitors is responsible for increased sensitivity to apoptosis of various cell types, including dev neural precursors cells  <cit>  or cancer cells  <cit> . recently, mmp- <dig> has been identified as a sheddase of fas that induces apoptosis resistance in tumour cells  <cit> . considering that astrocytes express high constitutive levels of fas  <cit>  and that astrocytes deficient for timp- <dig> likely have an increased proteolytic activity, we hypothesise that constitutive cleavage of fas may indeed reduce the levels of fas at the membrane, and consequently hamper astrocyte reactivity to anti-fas antibody treatment. mmp- <dig>  whose levels are constitutively increased in timp- <dig> ko astrocytes, decreased however after anti-fas treatment. it is tempting to speculate that elevated levels of mmp- <dig> contribute directly or indirectly to fas cleavage in normal conditions. the exposure of cells to a fas-l-like factor would favour the downregulation of mmp- <dig> in an attempt to re-establish the levels of the receptor. nevertheless, the role of mmp- <dig> as a fas sheddase has not been demonstrated yet.

together, these data bring support to the hypothesis that timp- <dig> exerts a pro-inflammatory effect by facilitating astrocyte reactivity through the regulation of the mmp/timp balance. astrocyte proliferation is a hallmark of reactivity in inflammatory settings. for the first time, we demonstrate that timp- <dig> induces astrocyte proliferation and this effect is stronger than the effects mediated by tnf-α or anti-fas antibody. our data support the idea that timp- <dig> exerts a control on cell growth, as previously suggested by other authors in different cell types  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that timp- <dig> accumulates in the nucleus of some cell types  <cit>  and it has been suggested that it could regulate the cell cycle via a mmp-independent mechanism. this idea is reinforced by the finding in our laboratory that mrtimp- <dig> increases by 2-fold the number of astrocytes in a mixed neuronal-astrocyte culture, and that this effect is not mimicked by broad spectrum mmp inhibitors . the baseline level of 3h-thymidin uptake in ko astrocytes was higher than in the wt. perhaps, for this reason, a pro-inflammatory stimulus with cytokines or timp- <dig> did not induce further significant increases in ko astrocyte proliferation. it is possible that a low constitutive expression of timp- <dig> maintains astrocytes in a resting "low proliferative" state that reacts promptly to a pro-inflammatory stimulus. on the contrary, the chronic absence of timp- <dig> may cause a state of permanent mild "reactivity" or "inflammatory status" that increases the response threshold for new exogenous pro-inflammatory stimuli. from the above, it follows that timp- <dig> might actually act as a homeostatic factor for astrocytes in the resting state, and as a pro-inflammatory factor in stressful conditions, notably in seizing and ischemic brains, where early and massive induction of timp- <dig> in neurons  <cit>  precede astrocyte reactivity. pro-inflammatory effects of timp- <dig> have also been suggested in in vivo models of rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> .

we expected that mutant astrocytes resistant to fas-mediated induction of mcp- <dig> would attract lymphocytes less efficiently than wt astrocytes displaying a strong upregulation of mcp- <dig> in the same treatment conditions. the fact that untreated astrocytes did increase by 300% the number of migrating lymphocytes clearly indicates that these glial cells have a strong chemoattractant capacity in culture conditions, perhaps in part because of their constitutive mcp- <dig> release. moreover, the finding that anti-fas antibody alone caused a 200% increase in lymphocyte migration reveals also a potent chemotactic effect of fasl, independently of its cellular source, in clear contrast with the absence of chemotactic effects of tnf-α alone. these data are coherent with previous reports demonstrating that soluble fasl is chemotactic for neutrophils and that an anti-fas antibody mimics this effect  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that fas activation stimulates motility in the absence of cytotoxicity  <cit> . in our experimental model, it its possible that the threshold of stimulation necessary for fas/astrocyte-mediated lymphocyte migration is already achieved by the individual components of the tandem.

the strong chemoattractant effect of timp- <dig> deficient astrocytes when exposed to tnf-α, cannot be interpreted on the basis of the mcp- <dig> release, since the latter was equivalent in both wt and timp- <dig> deficient cells. this finding suggests that mcp- <dig> alone is not sufficient to critically influence the chemoattraction of lymphocytes. the activity of mcps is regulated by mmp-mediated proteolytic processing, resulting in new bioactive truncated proteins with antagonist effects on leukocyte migration. in this scenario, mmps would indirectly act as anti-inflammatory agents  <cit> . however, we cannot speculate on a possible interaction between gelatinases  and mcp- <dig> since the latter has been reported to be specifically cleaved by mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  <cit> . an alternative way of interpreting the increased lymphocyte migration in the timp- <dig> deficient astrocytes exposed to tnf-α, refers to the possible regulation of icam- <dig> by gelatinases at the surface of astrocytes; mmps cleave membrane-bound icam- <dig> in astrocytes  <cit> , and mmp- <dig> appears to be the key enzyme processing icam- <dig> in tumour cells  <cit> . soluble icam- <dig>  generated by this cleavage has been reported to induce macrophage inflammatory protein- <dig>  in mouse astrocytes and subsequently stimulate leucocytes migration  <cit> . a lower timp- <dig> inhibitory capacity in the mutant astrocytes, along with an increased gelatinase activity, would favour sicam- <dig> proteolytic generation and possibly lymphocyte migration after tnf-α treatment. this idea is coherent with the overall lower icam- <dig> levels found in the timp- <dig> ko mice.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present data provide evidence linking the mmp/timp balance to the reactive response of astrocytes following pro-inflammatory stimuli. the control of astrocyte reactivity by the mmp/timp axis affects in a particular way the fas/fasl pathway, and suggests that in astrocytes, the outcome of the neuroinflammatory status in pathological situations may involve the mutual regulation of these two molecular systems. we can not exclude that other mmp substrates  are also affected by changes in the proteolytic balance. we are just starting to unveil the importance that the proteolytic modification of bioactive factors may have in the control of cell behaviour and intercellular communication. the study of the mmp/timp roles in neural cells and of the mechanisms whereby these proteinases and inhibitors exert the control of cell behaviour is a challenging question that needs further investigation.
