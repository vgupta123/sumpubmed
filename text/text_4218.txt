BACKGROUND
cancer is fundamentally a disease of genomic origin. alterations in genes and regulatory elements critical to cell cycle control lead to uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, the common signature of all cancers. such events can cause amplification or mutational activation of oncogenes
 <cit> , deletion or mutation deactivation of tumor suppressor genes
 <cit> , orientation of genes with incorrect regulatory regions
 <cit> , gene fusion products
 <cit> , etc. as cancers evolve, they accumulate a cascade of mutations, ranging in size from a single nucleotide change to the gain or loss of entire chromosomes
 <cit> . coupled with the subclonal heterogeneity that is a hallmark of solid tumors
 <cit> , obtaining a complete portrait of the genetic landscape of human cancer remains a significant challenge.

synergy between revolutionary genomic tools and advances in high-throughput computing has facilitated the development of a number of methods for detecting mutations. chromosome banding and spectral karyotyping 
 <cit>  are low-resolution techniques used to detect large-scale chromosomal features. however, obtaining metaphase spreads for performing a karyotype is often difficult, especially when working with solid tumor biopsies and paraffin embedded, formalin fixed tissue. fluorescence in situ hybridization  and its variants are a family of molecular cytogenetic techniques developed to correlate specific sequences to cytogenetic observations
 <cit> . fish offers higher resolution  and has the advantage of not requiring metaphase spreads, but is limited by the fact that it requires a prior hypotheses about the locus of interest, making it unsuitable for discovery based research. hybridization based microarray approaches, like snp microarrays and array comparative genome hybridization , have been extensively used to detect large scale amplifications and deletions in tumor genomes
 <cit> , but are unable to detect changes where there is no net gain or loss of dna, such as inversions and balanced translocations, which have been shown to be an important mechanism for oncogenic transformation
 <cit> . moreover, microarrays do not offer structural information, necessitating follow-up experiments to identify the breakpoints and sequence context of the aberration. microarrays are also restricted to regions of the genome amenable to unique probe design, which precludes repeat-rich regions and novel insertions that are hotbeds of variation and mutation
 <cit> . most commercial microarrays  lose sensitivity below ~ <dig> kb, and variants, particularly insertions, in this size range have remained largely unexplored, especially in cancer genomes
 <cit> .

the advent of massively parallel, short read dna sequencing- the ‘second generation’ sequencing technologies, and their application to cancer has also accelerated the pace of mutation discovery. initially applied to targeted subsets of the genome, such as specific gene families 
 <cit> , or all the coding sequences 
 <cit> , second-generation sequencing is increasingly being used to interrogate whole cancer genomes
 <cit> . in theory, second-generation sequencing of whole genomes has the ability to discern the full range of genomic alterations. in practice, however, more than 90% of events discovered by these platforms are less than  <dig> kb, and are biased towards deletions rather than insertions
 <cit> . second-generation sequencing instruments typically generate shorter reads with higher error rates from relatively short insert libraries, which present a significant computational and bioinformatic challenge in alignment and assembly
 <cit> . read-pair mapping approaches have successfully identified point mutations and indels in cancer
 <cit> , but are limited by the insert size of the dna library to detecting base substitutions and small indels
 <cit>  and are often confounded by repetitive regions of the genome. further, accurate prediction of the exact breakpoints of an aberration depends on very tight size distribution of the dna library, which can make library construction difficult
 <cit> . whole genome sequencing followed by de novo assembly might mitigate some of these issues, but current assembly algorithms tend to collapse homologous sequences, and consequently dramatically under-represent repeats and segmental duplications that are known to be critical mediators of genomic rearrangement
 <cit> .

there remains a pressing need for discovery-based systems that can provide a scalable, comprehensive view of the cancer genome in its entirety. in this study, we present optical mapping as one such system. optical mapping creates high-resolution ordered restriction maps of whole genomes through the analysis of ensembles of single molecule restriction maps. it has previously been used to map the genomes of microbes
 <cit> , plants
 <cit>  and mammals
 <cit> . however, this is the first time it has been employed to analyze the genome of a solid tumor. optical mapping offers several unique advantages towards assembling the complex structure of a cancer genome. genomic dna isolated directly from cells is analyzed, thereby obviating any bias introduced by amplification or cloning steps. moreover, because the dna is of high-molecular weight , segmental duplications and other repeat-rich regions of the genome are revealed, and additionally, the structure and long-range context of any aberration are determined. since the restriction maps are made from single dna molecules, optical mapping effectively pieces together heterogeneous alterations, which is especially important for tumor genome analysis, as we demonstrate in oligodendroglioma.

oligodendrogliomas are frontal lobe tumors that are thought to arise from oligodendrocytes, supporting brain cells which provide myelination for neurons
 <cit> . the concerted loss of heterozygosity  of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, observed in 50-70% of patients, is a molecular signature of this malignancy
 <cit> . the remarkably high prevalence of this molecular marker suggests that these regions harbor one or more tumor suppressor genes that might play an important role in the development of the tumor. allelic losses of 1p/19q have been correlated with positive response to chemo- and radiotherapy and prolonged survival for patients with oligodendroglioma
 <cit> . however, it remains unclear whether loh of 1p/19q is a prognostic biomarker for a more indolent tumor subtype that has fewer unfavorable mutations overall, rather than predictive of treatment sensitivity
 <cit> . in fact, studies have shown that 1p/19q codeleted tumors have slower growth rates and are more responsive to treatment than tumors without the codeletion
 <cit> . in order to explore each of these possibilities, optical mapping was used to create physical maps from two individual oligodendroglioma tumor biopsies for the purpose of identifying and characterizing structural changes on a whole genome basis.

RESULTS
optical map construction
we used the optical mapping  system to explore the genomic landscape of a solid tumor. optical mapping creates high-resolution physical maps of genomes through the analysis of ensembles of single molecule ordered restriction maps. the tumor biopsies were disaggregated into single cells, then run through a percoll gradient to enrich for cancer cells . high molecular weight genomic dna was extracted directly from these cells, stretched and immobilized in regular arrays on positively charged glass surfaces using a microfluidic device 
 <cit> . after deposition, the dna was digested with the restriction enzyme swai. the surface-bound restriction fragments remained in register, and were stained with a fluorescent dye and imaged by automated fluorescent microscopy . dedicated machine vision software calculated the size, in kilobase pairs , of each fragment based on measurements of integrated fluorescent intensity, resulting in the high throughput, massively parallel generation of ordered restriction maps, or ‘rmaps’, from individual genomic dna molecules 
 <cit> . the oligodendroglioma datasets comprise close to  <dig>  such rmaps, with an average size of greater than  <dig> kb . the relative order and distance between successive restriction fragments in a single molecule optical map can be used to determine the precise location in the genome that gave rise to that molecule, by means of pair-wise alignment against an in-silico restriction map
 <cit> . the hf <dig> tumor dataset comprised  <dig>  aligned rmaps, corresponding to  <dig>  fold coverage of the human genome, while the hf <dig> dataset comprised  <dig>  aligned maps, representing  <dig>  fold coverage of the human genome . in the absence of a karyotype, our assessment of ploidy is based on optical map coverage and affymetrix array analysis. both these platforms, discussed in detail in subsequent sections, calculate chromosome copy number relative to normal, diploid genomes, and are in agreement that neither tumor sample is polyploid. they do, however, display aneuploidy, due to allelic losses of specific chromosomes/chromosome arms , so if anything the coverage is likely to be higher than what we reported.

the rmaps that cluster together upon pair-wise alignment were then assembled into consensus optical maps and analyzed for presence of structural variants using the bioinformatics pipeline described in
 <cit> . the final consensus map contigs span  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the human genome for tumors hf <dig> and hf <dig>  respectively.

optical map coverage analysis
discernment of copy number variants
copy number was inferred from aligned coverage of rmaps, prior to assembly, in a manner analogous to read-depth based methods for detecting copy number variants from second generation sequencing data . briefly, rmaps were aligned to the in silico reference map, and then partitioned into discrete windows spanning each chromosome. these alignments were then compared to alignments of a reference data set  that was used to ‘normalize’ the observed coverage. this was necessary because the number of rmaps that align to a particular region of the genome depends, in part, on the density of restriction sites in that region, which varies from chromosome to chromosome . a hidden markov model  was then fitted to this data, and copy number changes were detected 
 <cit> . optical map coverage analysis confirmed the allelic loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q in hf <dig> and hf <dig>  the breakpoints appear to be very close to the centromere, consistent with the proposed mechanism of an unbalanced reciprocal translocation mediating the loh event
 <cit> . additionally, coverage analysis also detected allelic loss of chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , which are known to be rarer events associated with oligodendroglioma.

solid tumor heterogeneity
the genome wide optical map of hf <dig> was created using dna from two adjacent slices of the tumor:  <dig>   rmaps originated from slice  <dig> and  <dig>   rmaps from slice  <dig> . interestingly, when the rmaps were partitioned according to the slice they originated from, and coverage analysis was performed separately, unique copy number profiles were obtained for each slice. in addition to allelic losses of 1p and 19q, slice  <dig> also had loh of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  while slice  <dig> had evidence of loh of 19p . solid tumors are dynamic aggregates of continually evolving subclones, resulting in spatial and temporal genetic heterogeneity. our findings suggest that the tumor slices used for optical mapping evolved from distinct cancer cell clones, and is congruent with recent evidence of branched evolutionary tumor growth
 <cit> . although assembly of whole genome maps on a per slice basis was not feasible due to insufficient depth of coverage, our results establishes proof-of-principle of optical mapping to interrogate tumor heterogeneity.

discovery of optical structural alterations
the optical consensus maps generated by map assembler were aligned to the in silico restriction map , and by comparison of the order and sizing of the  <dig>  restriction fragments  between the experimental and the reference map. such comparisons revealed structural variants in the experimental genome that were classified as four types: extra cuts , where the optical consensus map displays a restriction site that was not predicted by the reference sequence; missing cuts , where a cut that was predicted was not observed in the experimental map; insertions , where the size of a fragment in the consensus map was significantly larger than its counterpart in the reference map; deletions , where a fragment in the experimental map was smaller than the corresponding reference fragment ; and finally, complex events  involving multiple cut or size differences . approximately a third of the ecs and mcs represent small indels that are below the resolution of optical mapping 
 <cit> . figure 
3c shows an example of each class of variant detected by optical mapping.

at first glance, it might appear that any one of these variants could be attributed to errors inherent in optical mapping. for instance, a missing cut could be due to incomplete digestion, an extra cut could result from spurious cutting by the restriction enzyme, or physical breakage of the dna molecule, and uneven staining could lead to inaccurate estimation of fragment size. however, the high throughput advantage of optical mapping allows us to distinguish such random errors from legitimate genomic events. any alteration in the optical consensus map was supported by multiple single molecule maps , each representing an independent observation at that locus. the optical mapping error models estimated the statistical significance of each structural variant, after taking into account the quality and quantity of the data
 <cit> .

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differences were detected in hf <dig> and hf <dig> respectively . the distribution of structural variants across the genome is uniform and the pattern is similar for both tumors . variants range in size from single base differences to complex genomic events spanning hundreds of kilobases . approximately  <dig> single base changes were detected in each tumor, including point mutations , polymorphic snps where only one allele has a swai restriction site , and small indels that create or remove a swai cut site but are below the detection limit of optical mapping.  <dig> indels with a median size of  <dig>  kb were detected in each sample . for comparison, the median size of indels reported in the database of genomic variants is  <dig>  kb . ~ <dig> complex events were found in each tumor, including known polymorphic loci such as the major histocompatibility complex , giving us confidence that these results are not spurious. optical mapping also discerns balanced genomic events, where there is no net gain or loss of genomic sequence. a putative inversion spanning  <dig> kb of chromosome  <dig> was observed in hf <dig> which appears to disrupt the znf <dig> gene . finally, the largest events detected by optical mapping include gains or losses of entire arms of chromosomes, for example, the allelic loss of chromosome  <dig> illustrated in figure 
4d, and discussed in detail previously. intersection counts with genes, segmental duplications, published snps  and published structural variants  are shown in additional file
 <dig>  comprehensive breakdown of the overlaps are shown in additional file

optical mapping provides a comprehensive description of the vast and complex landscape of cancer genomes. the ability to study the genome in its entirety, including non-genic or repetitive regions using a single technology minimizes ascertainment bias. as detailed in subsequent sections, it is employed to generate a list of candidate cancer genes that is not hypothesis-limited, and elucidate their structure at sub-genic resolution.

validation of copy number and structural variants
experimental validation: snp array
the affymetrix genome wide human snp  <dig>  array, which has probes for detection of both snps and copy number variants , was used to validate our findings.

both platforms concurred on the loh of chromosomes 1p, 19q and  <dig>  but allelic loss of chromosome  <dig> in hf <dig> was not detected by the affymetrix array. the copy number profile generated by running the hmm algorithm on the maps from the first slice of tumor hf <dig> was similar to that from the array, which suggests that the dna originated from tumor sections that were in closer proximity.

many of the snp probes on the affymetrix chip correspond to swai snip-snps. hence, the array data was used to validate ecs and mcs. we observed 100%  concordance between the snp genotype and the swai cut pattern at all overlapping cut differences in both tumors .

the copy number variants detected by the array were also compared to optical mapping indels. signal intensities from the chip were normalized by global median scaling, and copy number was assessed using several different algorithms , relative to a reference model file generated from the  <dig> hapmap samples. though the resolution of array cgh is much lower than optical mapping, we were able to validate  <dig> structural variants in tumor hf <dig> and  <dig> in tumor hf <dig> .

experimental validation: pcr
the nature of many of the structural variants, being within repetitive portions of the genome, but detected by optical mapping unfortunately precludes their comprehensive validation by simple pcr techniques. accordingly, we selected two variants that were amenable to pcr and overlapped genes that may offer insights into the chemo- and radio-sensitivity of oligodendroglioma. these loci were then pcr amplified, cloned and sequenced .

the optical map shows an ec in the park <dig> gene in hf <dig> . park <dig> is a putative tumor suppressor, and mutations in this gene have been reported in multiple cancer types . an  <dig> bp amplicon spanning the predicted location of the ec was obtained , and sanger sequencing proved that a g to t transversion resulted in the creation of a new swai restriction site .

we also validated an ec in tumor hf <dig> that occurred in the stmn <dig> gene . as discussed in subsequent sections, stmn <dig> regulates microtubule dynamics and is believed to be a target of beta-catenin/tcf signalling. we amplified a  <dig> bp region around the putative mutation , and were able to validate the alteration via sequencing .

comparative validation
we also validated our findings by comparing them to two sources- optical mapping data from several normal genomes, and publicly available snp and structural variant data. first, oligodendroglioma structural variants were compared against structural variants found by optical mapping of  <dig> other normal human genomes by our laboratory. this internal database includes: 
 <cit> , a lymphocyte-derived cell line  and an early passage human embryonic stem cell line
 <cit> ). 80%-90% of oligodendroglioma variants were also detected in at least one of the normal human genomes , suggesting that such loci are polymorphic, and affirming the veracity of our findings. then, oligodendroglioma structural variants were compared against variants in the database of genomic variants . the dgv is an extensive catalogue of structural variation in normal humans, currently holding  <dig>  events detected by a variety of platforms. we observed the greatest concordance with variants found by fosmid-end sequencing  and high density oligonucleotide array cgh  . finally, cut differences detected by optical mapping were compared to published snps. detailed breakdown of these intersections are shown in additional file
3; parameters for comparisons are described in the methods section.

candidate mutations
separation of mutational and polymorphic osas
the ultimate goal of our mapping efforts was to identify genes or genomic elements that maybe important to the biology of oligodendroglioma, with the caveat that such ‘candidates’ represent hypotheses requiring rigorous testing to establish their functional role in tumorigenesis. distinguishing between structural polymorphisms and somatically acquired mutations is a key step towards accomplishing this goal. unfortunately, matched normal dna from the individuals whose tumors were optically mapped was not available. instead, we adopted a stringent filtering scheme to remove putative polymorphisms and enrich for somatic mutations, based on comparisons to internal and publicly available data . parameters for these comparisons were determined based on the optical mapping error model and designed to be extremely parsimonious . as a result of these operations, we arrived at a total of  <dig> somatic mutations  in hf <dig> and  <dig> somatic mutations  in hf <dig> since two mutations are seen in both tumors,  <dig> unique candidate cancer genes were identified in oligodendroglioma . a few interesting candidate genes will be discussed in the next section.

candidates common to both hf <dig> and hf1551
two candidate genes, npas <dig> and osbpl <dig>  harbored mutations in both tumor samples . npas <dig>  shows a complex event accompanied by a ~ <dig> kb gain in the hf <dig> optical map, and a missing cut in the hf <dig> optical map . this neuronally expressed basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor has been implicated in schizophrenia
 <cit> and bipolar disorder
 <cit> , and is frequently deleted or inactivated in many cancers. recently, it has been demonstrated that npas <dig> exhibits features of a tumor suppressor which drives late progression of malignant astrocytomas, and is a negative prognostic marker for survival
 <cit> .

both tumor optical maps display cut differences in the osbpl <dig>  gene . this gene plays a vital role in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization and lipid metabolism
 <cit> . it is highly expressed in b-cell associated malignancies
 <cit> , where it is one of the common sites of retroviral integration
 <cit> . an independent study that used exon sequencing to study oligodendroglioma also found somatic mutations in osbpl3
 <cit> .

candidates observed in either hf <dig> or hf1551
in the hf <dig> optical map, we observe a point mutation that creates a swai restriction site in the park <dig> gene . this gene encodes an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, called parkin that catalyzes the ubiquitination of a variety of target proteins for proteasome mediated degradation. germline mutations in park <dig> have long been known to cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinson’s disease
 <cit> . more recently, park <dig> has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in glioblastoma multiforme, breast, ovary, lung, colorectal and liver cancers
 <cit> . it encompasses most of fra6e, the third most active common fragile site in the human genome
 <cit> , and shares the characteristics of other tumor suppressors such as fhit and wwox, that also occur in fragile sites. park <dig> is frequently deleted or inactivated in cancer cell lines and primary tumors
 <cit> , and concomitantly, parkin expression is either significantly diminished or absent
 <cit> . unlike classical tumor suppressors where biallelic inactivation is necessary for oncogenesis, heterozygous mutations in park <dig> are sufficient to confer a growth advantage during tumor development
 <cit> . restoring parkin expression in parkin-deficient cell lines reduces their profileration in vitro <cit> , while injection of parkin-deficient cells into immunocompromised mice generate tumors in vivo <cit> . interestingly, park <dig> also mediates chemosensitivity in breast cancer via microtubule dependent mechanism
 <cit> .

stmn <dig>  is another interesting candidate gene. we observe a point mutation in this gene in tumor hf <dig> . stmn <dig> is a neuron specific member of the stathmin family of small regulatory phosphoproteins which control cell profileration and differentiation
 <cit> . it is up-regulated in liver cancer and has been identified as a target of β-catenin/tcf-mediated transcription
 <cit> . stmn <dig> sequesters soluble tubulin, forming a ternary complex, inhibits microtubule assembly and induces their disassembly
 <cit> . its highly similar, but more well-studied paralog stmn <dig>  located on chromosome 1p, is known to sensitize cells to anti-microtubule drugs in glioma
 <cit> , breast
 <cit>  and prostate cancer
 <cit> .in light of recent studies demonstrating the synergistic epistasis between paralogous genes involved in essential cellular functions and its therapeutic implications
 <cit> , we speculate that stmn <dig> and stmn <dig> might be functionally redundant, and inactivation of stmn <dig> might, in part, explain the treatment sensitivity of oligodendroglioma.

in the hf <dig> optical map, we see an extra cut in the gene zfyve <dig> . spastizin, the zinc finger protein encoded by zfyve <dig>  causes the neurological disorder hereditary spastic paraplegia
 <cit> . this gene binds to the tumor suppressor beclin- <dig> and regulates cytokinesis
 <cit> , and is recurrently mutated in breast cancer
 <cit> .

we detected a  <dig> kb inversion on 7q <dig>  in tumor hf <dig>  hemizygous deletions spanning a  <dig> - <dig>  mb region of this locus cause the neurodevelopmental disorder, williams-beuren  syndrome
 <cit> . however, inversion of this region is polymorphic, and is present in ~6% of the general population, and in ~25% of transmitting parents in wb families
 <cit> . given the disparity in size between the aberration detected by om and reported instances of the wb inversion, it is possible that the event we observe arose de novo and is distinct from the ‘canonical’ inversion. to test this hypothesis, we ran several targeted assemblies on the wb region. the general strategy for this approach was to modify the reference map in-silico to reflect our hypothesized structure , and then use the iterative assembly framework described earlier to pull out individual restriction maps and generate an optical consensus map . since our map assembly pipeline was designed to provide the single most conservative answer, this approach is helpful in detecting large-scale aberrations that are significantly different from the reference sequence. of the eight modified reference maps we started with, the one that reflected the canonical wb inversion/deletion did not grow, while the one that reflected the  <dig> kb event successfully generated a consensus map that spanned it and flanked contiguous regions on chromosome  <dig> . the optical consensus map also closes the putative sequence gap immediately to the right of the inversion, and in fact, approximately half of the sequence gaps in the reference genome  are spanned by optical consensus maps. the inversion encompasses the genes gtf2ird <dig>  pms2p <dig>  wbscr <dig>  gtf2ird2b and ncf <dig>  and its breakpoints appear to disrupt the genes gtf2i and stag3l <dig>  in the absence of matched normal dna, it is impossible to ascertain if the inversion we detected was inherited through the germline or somatically acquired, however, this is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of inversions in the wb region in the context of cancer.

candidates on 1p or 19q
the concerted loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q is a hallmark of oligodendroglioma. seen in 50%-70% of tumors, it is believed that these regions harbor one or more tumor suppressor genes that play an important role in the development of this cancer. hence, somatic mutations on these chromosome arms are particularly interesting. we found putative mutations on  <dig> genes residing on chromosome 1p  and  <dig> gene on 19q . the roles of these genes in normal and disease states, and the structural variants we found in them are discussed briefly in the subsequent section.

we observe a  <dig>  kb deletion that potentially ablates the first exon of tceb <dig> in tumor hf <dig>  tceb <dig>  encodes the transcriptionally active subunit of the mammalian elongin complex
 <cit> . this elongation factor stimulates the rate of transcription by suppressing the transient pausing of rna polymerase ii on the dna template
 <cit> . tceb <dig> is part of a multi-protein complex that functions as an elongin-based ubiquitin ligase
 <cit> , similar to the von hippel-lindau  tumor suppressor complex, by mediating dna damage induced ubiquitination and degradation of polymerase ii
 <cit> .

tumor hf <dig> also has an insertion in the 1p-encoded gene pax <dig> . the pax genes encode a family of transcription factors that control development within the neural, myogenic and lymphoid lineages
 <cit> . pax <dig>  in particular, is essential for survival, proliferation and migration of myogenic progenitor cells
 <cit> , and cell fate decisions in the developing nervous system
 <cit> . pax <dig> is the target of a recurrent gene fusion with the forkhead protein fkhr/foxo <dig> that is found in ~15% of patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
 <cit> . the fusion transcript is much more abundant and transcriptionally active than wild type pax7
 <cit> , suggesting that the deregulation of pax <dig> downstream target genes contribute to tumorigenesis.

in the hf <dig> optical map, we observe a missing cut in the gene sipa1l <dig>  which is located on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  this gene encodes a ras specific gtpase activating protein that is found at epithelial junctional complexes. these complexes play a crucial role in mechanical adhesion between epithelial cells to form cellular sheets and in the organization of actin cytoskeleton
 <cit> . somatic mutations in sipa1l <dig> have been discovered in cancers of the brain
 <cit> , prostate
 <cit> , breast
 <cit> , ovary
 <cit> , pancreas
 <cit> , colon
 <cit> , skin
 <cit>  and hematopoietic system
 <cit> , but a cohesive picture of the functional role that this gene plays in these diverse cancer types is yet to emerge.

taken together, the candidate genes discovered by optical mapping point to critical roles of transcriptional control and cytoskeletal organisation in the etiology of oligodendroglioma.

non-genic candidates
protein coding sequences comprise less than 2% of the human genome. the vast non-coding portion of the genome, once believed to be ‘junk dna’, is rife with functional elements that orchestrate the gene expression program of cells. recent evidence from the encode  consortium indicates that as much as  <dig> % of the human genome encodes a defined product  or displays a reproducible biochemical signature 
 <cit> . such signatures, either alone or in combinations, mark genomic sequences with important functions, such as promoters, enhancers, insulators and silencers
 <cit> . the encode data sheds some light on possible functional roles of optical mapping candidates that are not located within genes. a number of these candidates are actively transcribed, for instance an ec on chromosome  <dig> of hf <dig> overlaps the transcribed pseudogene gusbp <dig>  several non-genic variants occur within long intergenic non-coding rnas  coding regions . both these classes of genomic elements provide an additional tier of gene regulation, and contribute significantly to the transcriptional landscape of human cancers
 <cit> . several candidates also show interesting changes in their putative functions in cancer tissues. for example, we observe a mc on chromosome  <dig>  in a genomic region bearing a histone modification pattern characteristic of insulators in multiple different normal cell types, but the pattern changes to that of an enhancer in hepatocellular carcinoma.

optical mapping provides a global view of the cancer genome, free from biases introduced by cloning, amplification or hybridization, and discovers structural variation and mutation on a scale ranging from kilobases to megabases. moreover, since the platform uses high-molecular weight dna as analyte, the long-range context and connectivity of each variant is preserved, potentiating meaningful interpretation of candidate genes. however, optical mapping does not provide single-base resolution. point mutations or indels spanning a few base pairs, such as the events frequently observed in cic and fubp <dig> genes in 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas, are below the lower limit of resolution and would remain undetected .

biological significance of candidates identified by optical mapping
the aim of this study is to generate new hypotheses for oligodendroglioma genetics, and as such, functional studies are beyond the scope of this paper. however, by surveying publicly available data on the candidates discerned by optical mapping, we can gain some insight into the roles they might play in malignant transformation.

moving beyond the two tumors hf <dig> and hf <dig>  we wanted to take the candidate cancer genes and analyze them in the context of other genome-wide studies. most somatic mutations in cancer cells arise due to genomic instability and do not contribute to tumorigenesis. however, mutations in genes that promote tumor development, so-called ‘driver’ mutations tend to be recurrent. to assess the extent of recurrence of our candidates across a large number of samples, we used the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer . the cosmic database is a comprehensive archive of somatic mutations in human cancer, combining manually curated data from scientific literature and the output from the cancer genome project
 <cit> .  <dig> genes from our list of candidates had mutation frequencies  greater than 10%, with the top hits being myof , cecr <dig>  and zfyve <dig> . mutation frequencies for all the candidate genes are listed in table 
 <dig> 

since cells can employ a number of mechanisms to compensate for loss or mutational inactivation of genes, a more direct way of assessing the functional role of a given candidate gene is to analyze changes in its pattern of expression between normal and disease states. array based expression profiling of tumors hf <dig> and hf <dig> was performed by fine et. al.
 <cit> , and is publicly available through the ncbi geo database
 <cit> , accession gse <dig>  differential expression analysis carried out using the ebarrays algorithm
 <cit>  shows that  <dig> genes  from our list of  <dig> candidates is significantly up or down-regulated . a complete list of differentially expressed genes can be found in additional file
 <dig>  to assay for functional effects in an even larger population of tumors, we queried for changes in expression of our candidate genes in rembrandt, a database of molecular data on brain tumors . the results are reported for each gene as the number of oligodendroglioma samples in the database that are differential expression by at least two-fold . all but  <dig> of our candidate genes were differentially expressed in at least  <dig> tumor samples. congruent with the previous analysis, npas <dig>  stmn <dig>  zfyve <dig> and phldb <dig> are the most frequently deregulated candidate genes.

finally, we asked what biological processes and pathways are significantly enriched or depleted in our list of candidates. this can identify fundamental cellular mechanisms that contribute to cancer development. as a whole, these candidate genes are enriched for proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization . our candidate genes are also significantly enriched for microrna binding targets . approximately half of the over-represented sites have been associated with binding of cancer-related micrornas
 <cit> , underscoring the importance of post-transcriptional control of expression in oligodendroglioma.

while these results are not a direct indicator of aberrant function, this is a demonstration that optical mapping results can be expanded to clinical samples and used to create direct functional hypotheses.

CONCLUSIONS
we have applied optical mapping to explore the genomic landscape of solid tumor oligodendroglioma. ~ <dig> discrete structural variants have been discovered, ranging in size from single base changes to loss of entire chromosomes. the structure of each alteration has been elucidated at sub-genic resolution, while retaining the long-range context of the event.  <dig> somatic mutations have been identified,  <dig> of which affect genes. these novel candidate cancer genes provide focused, testable hypotheses for follow-up functional investigation. we believe that optical mapping provides a comprehensive, high-resolution description of the complex and disperse genomes of solid tumors.
