BACKGROUND
bacteria of the genus shigella are fastidious gram-negative organisms that cause an estimated  <dig>  million cases of shigellosis annually worldwide, and are responsible for  <dig>  million deaths  <cit> . shigellosis is an acute intestinal infectious disease. its symptoms range from mild watery diarrhea to a life-threatening dysenteric syndrome with blood, mucus and pus in stools  <cit> . the severity of the disease depends on the virulence of the infecting strain. therefore, clinical diagnosis tests for shigellosis should not only focus on the determination of the strain’s biochemical and serological types, but also on the determination of the strain’s virulence. based on biotyping, the shigella genus contains four species with  <dig> serotypes . in china, shigella flexneri 2a  is the predominant subgroup  <cit> .

to simultaneously, effectively, and rapidly detect the pathogen and determine its virulence, three chromosome- and plasmid-encoded virulence genes   <cit>  were chosen to assist in the development of a multiplex pcr  assay. ipah is present on both the chromosome and on the large shigella virulence plasmid. therefore, ipah is considered a stable pcr target for pathogen identification  <cit> . the ial gene is located in the cell-entry region of the large virulence plasmid that encodes an important part of the molecular machinery required for bacterial invasion and intracellular survival  <cit> . this region is bracketed by insertion-like  elements is <dig> and is <dig>  with a high tendency for automatic deletion  <cit> . detection based on ial provides some information pertaining to bacterial virulence but can easily generate false negative results  <cit> . the set1b gene is located on pathogenicity island  <dig>  of the chromosome and encodes shigella enterotoxin  <dig> subunit b. enterotoxin  <dig> causes the watery phase of diarrhea in shigellosis  <cit> . studies have shown that set1b is present exclusively in s. flexneri 2a  <cit> . an mpcr system should be able to determine, in a single reaction, whether the genes related to pathogenesis of a particular shigella strain are encoded on the chromosome or the plasmid, and also to determine the serotype of a particular strain  <cit> .

the s. flexneri 2a pic gene, which is located at an unstable chromosomal site of s. flexneri 2a pai- <dig>  is spontaneously deleted at a low frequency  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the pic and set1b loci are overlapping genes encoded on opposite strands, and set1b is within pic <cit> . the pic protein is a  <dig> kda auto-transporter protein, secreted by the serine protease auto-transporter from members of the enterobacteriaceae family  <cit> . to date, pic has only been found in enteroaggregative escherichia coli , uropathogenic e. coli  and s. flexneri 2a. pic has been shown to exhibit hemagglutination and mucinolytic activities in vitro <cit> . however, it has also been shown that pic is unable to elicit a cytotoxic effect in the ht29-c <dig> and hep- <dig> epithelial cell lines  <cit> .

the major aims of our study were to detect and determine the strain of the shigella pathogen and determine its virulence. we also investigated whether attenuation of sf <dig> virulence correlated to the loss of pic, by constructing a pic-deleted mutant and two complementation strains.

plaque formation tests on hela cells
twelve strains containing ipah, ial and set1b were further tested to determine their virulence in hela cells  using a plaque formation test  <cit> . hela cells were grown in 24-well tissue culture plates until they formed semi-confluent monolayers. the culture medium used was rpmi <dig> supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum , and 1% penicillin-streptomycin; and cultures were incubated at 37°c/5% co <dig>  cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline , and bacteria added to the semi-confluent hela cultures at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  after incubating at 37°c for  <dig> min, growth medium containing 5%  agar and  <dig> μg/ml gentamicin was poured into the 24-well plates, then incubated at 37°c/5% co <dig> for  <dig> h. hela cells were inoculated with sf <dig> as a positive control, and with e. coli atcc  <dig> as a negative control.

sequence and analysis of virulence genes on pai- <dig> of sf51
sf <dig> genomic dna was extracted using a qiaamp dna mini kit . pcr primers for amplification of pic, siga, int and orf <dig> from pai- <dig> of the sf <dig> clinical isolate were designed according to the sf <dig> sequence. amplicons were cloned into a pcr-xl-topo vector using a topo® xl pcr cloning kit , and the inserts were sequenced by sangon biotech  co. ltd, then identified using the standard nucleotide basic local alignment search tool .

construction of sf301-∆ pic
the upstream and downstream portions of pic were amplified by pcr. primers uppic-f-noti and uppic-r-xbai  were used to amplify the upstream fragment of pic, with primers downpic-f-xbai and downpic-r-bamhi  used to amplify the downstream fragment. the amplified downstream fragment of pic was digested with xbai and bamhi and ligated into psb <dig> which had been cut with the same restriction endonucleases  <cit> . we designated the resulting plasmid psb890-pic downstream. the amplified upstream pic fragment was digested with noti and xbai and ligated into psb890-pic downstream that had been digested with noti and xbai. the resulting vector was designated psb890-∆ pic and transformed into e. coli sm <dig> λpir cells, then introduced into sf <dig> through a bacterial conjugation test. after culturing on a sucrose lb agar plate at 22°c, sucrose-tolerant colonies were screened using shigella-specific minimal medium  <cit>  and a pcr employing primers upuppic-f and downdownpic-r . the mutant strain with the pic deletion was identified by sequencing and named sf301-∆ pic.

construction of complementation strains sf301-∆ pic/ppic and sf51/ppic
a plasmid containing pic was constructed using psc modified from prep <dig>  the pic gene was amplified from sf <dig> genomic dna using pcr. the pcr primers used were pic-psc-f-pfmli and pic-psc-r-acli . amplicons were inserted into psc, creating psc-pic, which was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and nucleic acid sequencing. verified psc-pic was transformed into sf301-∆ pic and sf <dig>  resulting in sf301-∆ pic/ppic and sf51/ppic, respectively.

s. flexneri growth curves
the growth curves of s. flexneri 2a strains were determined by measuring the optical density at  <dig> nm  as described previously  <cit> . briefly, overnight cultures were diluted 1: <dig> and incubated at 37°c with shaking . samples  of the bacterial cultures were taken every  <dig> min over  <dig> h and od measured. growth curves were created by plotting od <dig> against incubation time .

s. flexneri hela cell invasion assays
s. flexneri cell invasion assays were used to test the virulence of a sf <dig> clinical strain without set1b, sf301-∆ pic, wild-type sf <dig>  sf301-∆ pic/ppic and sf51/ppic. the ability of bacteria to invade hela cells was determined using a gentamicin protection assays  <cit> . hela cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates in dmem supplemented with 10% fcs and incubated at 37°c/5% co <dig> until they formed semi-confluent monolayers. sf <dig>  sf301-∆ pic, sf301-∆ pic /ppic, sf <dig> /ppic and sf <dig> were individually added to semi-confluent hela cells at an moi of  <dig>  bacteria were diluted and plated on lb agar plates. colony-forming units  were counted and added to hela cells. plates were centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min. after incubating at 37°c for  <dig> min, cells were washed three times with pbs, and gentamicin added to the medium at a final concentration of  <dig> μg/ml. the mixture was then incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c. hela cells in each well were lysed with  <dig> ml of pbs containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig> for  <dig> min at room temperature. lysates were diluted and plated onto lb agar plates in triplicate. colonies that grew on lb plates were counted. results were expressed as the number of bacteria recovered from gentamicin-treated cells divided by the number of inoculated bacteria added to the cell. cells inoculated with e. coli atcc  <dig>  an avirulent strain, were the negative controls. cell invasion assays were performed in triplicate for each strain, and the assay repeated twice.

sereny tests and pathohistological examination
a mouse sereny test was used to evaluate the virulence of all strains we examined in this study, as described by murayama  <cit> . a single red colony of s. flexneri on congo red agar  was inoculated into lb broth at 37°c for  <dig> h with constant shaking. female balb/c mice  were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> cfus per eye . symptoms and signs of keratoconjunctivitis in mice infected with bacteria were observed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h post-inoculation  <cit> . eyes inoculated with e. coli atcc  <dig> and normal saline  served as the negative controls. the invasiveness of bacteria was scored according to the following system: ‘−’ indicates no inflammation, and an infection level score of 0; ‘±’ is indicative of low levels of keratoconjunctivitis, and an infection level score of  <dig> ; ‘+’ indicates slight conjunctival inflammation with eyelid edema, and an infection level score of 1; ‘++’ indicates mild keratoconjunctivitis with eyelid edema, increased tear film evaporation and periocular hair loss, and an infection level score of 2; and ‘+++’ indicating fully developed keratoconjunctivitis with eyelid swelling, periocular hair loss, blepharophimosis, conjunctival follicles and purulent discharge, and an infection level score of  <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h post-inoculation, mice were euthanized and the eyes removed and fixed in 4% formalin in pbs . after hemotoxylin and eosin  staining, eye sections were examined using a light microscope.

statistical analysis
experimental data were analyzed with spss and comparisons made using student’s t-test. differences with a p-value less than  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
detection of ipah, ial, and set1b in s. flexneri clinical isolates
the ipah gene was detected in all  <dig> s. flexneri clinical isolates, whereas ial was detected in  <dig> isolates , and set1b detected in  <dig> isolates . amplicons for ipah, ial and set1b were not seen from e. coli atcc  <dig> samples. all three genes were detected in the sf <dig> positive control.

hela cell invasion of s. flexneri clinical isolates
nine isolates in our study contained all three genes, one sf <dig> isolate contained ipah and set1b, one sf <dig> isolate had ipah and ial, and one sf <dig> isolate contained only ipah . the nine isolates that contained all three virulence-associated genes demonstrated high invasive ability in hela cells . in hela cells, sf <dig> and sf <dig> were less invasive resulting in  <dig> and  <dig> plaques/well, respectively. sf <dig> lacked set1b but retained ial, and showed a decrease in invasiveness . using pcr and nucleotide sequencing, it was shown that sf <dig> lacked the entire pic gene on pai- <dig>  but harbored siga and other significant open reading frames .

hela cell invasion of sf <dig> and mutants
the growth curves for sf <dig>  sf301-∆ pic, sf <dig>  sf301-∆ pic/ppic and sf51/ppic were similar under aerobic growth conditions . gentamicin protection tests on hela cells revealed that the cell invasion ratio for clinical isolate sf <dig> with standard strain sf <dig> decreased by 34%, while the invasion ratio for sf301-∆ pic compared with sf <dig> decreased by 61% . the invasion abilities were partially recovered by the introduction of pic into deleted mutant sf301-∆ pic, which increased the ratio by 31% . the invasion abilities of sf51/ppic increased by 59% compared with sf <dig>  with cell invasion ratios of 35% and 22%, respectively . the e. coli atcc  <dig> strain was not found to invade hela cells.

mouse sereny tests and pathohistological examination
mouse sereny tests confirmed the results of the cell invasion tests. mild presentation of keratoconjunctivitis was observed  <dig> h after mice were infected with sf <dig>  symptoms included eyelid edema, increased tear film evaporation and periocular hair-loss that we scored as either + or ++, with an average infection level score of  <dig> . this developed into severe keratoconjunctivitis with maximal blepharophimosis at  <dig> h that we rated +++, and an average infection level score of  <dig> . keratoconjunctival inflammation continued for  <dig> h post-inoculation with sf <dig> . both the isolated and constructed pic-deletion mutants induced lower levels of inflammation in the eyes of mice than for sf <dig> . at  <dig> h post-inoculation, the pathogenicity of sf301-∆ pic in mouse eyes were assessed as + or ++ with an average infection level scores up to  <dig> ; for sf <dig>  pathogenicity was rated ± or + with an average infection level score less than  <dig> .

virulence was partially recovered by introducing the complementary psc-pic into the deletion mutants. at  <dig> h post-inoculation the pathogenicity of sf301-∆ pic/ppic was rated at + or ++ with an average infection level score  <dig> ; sf51/ppic pathogenicity was + or ++ with average infection level scores of  <dig> . at  <dig> h post-infection, inflammatory reactions were not observed in the normal saline negative controls . however, e. coli atcc  <dig> slight edema  in a single eyelid at  <dig> h post-infection with an average infection level score of  <dig> .

light microscopy assessment at  <dig> h post-infection revealed typical symptoms of sf <dig> infection. these included limited invasion, corneal epithelial thickening and loss, along with mild, moderate, or severe ulcers. both pic-deletion mutants showed fewer pathologic changes following h&e staining compared with sf <dig> .

discussion
shigella pathogenicity is a multigenic phenomenon involving the participation of genes on the unstable large virulence plasmid and chromosomal pais  <cit> . mobile genes encode key factors that help shigella invade tissue and maintain its intracellular viability  <cit> . the pathogenicity of the strain decreases markedly once the mobile genes are deleted  <cit> .

several studies have been conducted to detect virulence genes in shigella by mpcr, targeting ipah, ial, and rfc or stx <dig> for serotype identification  <cit> . in  <dig>  thong  <cit>  first described a new mpcr system to detect s. flexneri 2a by targeting four virulence genes . this mpcr system was able to determine, in a single reaction, whether genes related to pathogenesis of a particular shigella strain are associated with the chromosome or plasmid, and whether the serotype of the particular strain can be grouped under s. flexneri 2a  <cit> . in our present study, thong’s mpcr system was modified to identify s. flexneri 2a strains and their virulence using only three virulent genes . we omitted set1a from the mpcr system, as both set1b and set1a genes have been shown to exist in tandem on pai- <dig> of the bacterial chromosome, and they share the same promoter  <cit> . the low prevalence of ial  verifies that the cell-entry region on the large virulence plasmid of s. flexneri is prone to loss or deletion. the high prevalence of the set1b gene  verifies that in the rural regions of zhengding, the isolated epidemic strain of shigella was s. flexneri 2a. all of our mpcr results were confirmed by serological tests. we confirmed that comparable decreases in virulence occur following the deletion of essential elements in the large virulence plasmid   <cit> . a clinical sf <dig> isolate was found to retain ial but had lost set1b, and demonstrated an obvious decrease in hela cell invasion. this indicated to us that the chromosome locus around set1b may influence virulence.

the location of set1b is known to be in shigella pai- <dig>  <cit> , which exists exclusively in s. flexneri 2a. at least four major virulence genes are present in pai- <dig> . the autotransporter siga exhibits cytopathic effects on hep- <dig> cells  <cit> , and the autotransporter pic exhibits hemagglutination and mucinolytic activities in vitro <cit> . upstream from pic are two is elements, is <dig> and is <dig>  followed by pic itself, and then a perd is element  <cit> . this implies that pic can be spontaneously deleted.

the upstream element int, downstream element orf <dig>  cytopathic factor gene siga, and the hemagglutinin gene pic on pai- <dig> of sf <dig> were sequenced to verify whether sf <dig> lost the whole pai- <dig> or only part of the genetic locus around set1b. our results revealed that the entire pic gene on pai- <dig> was deleted in this case, whereas other genes  were unaffected . this result also suggests that a decrease in virulence of sf <dig> is not related to siga, but may be associated with pic deletion.

to confirm that the decreased virulence phenotype in sf <dig> was associated with deletion of pic, we knocked out pic from the sf <dig> strain to produce sf301-∆ pic. additionally, complementation strains sf301-∆ pic/ppic and sf51pic/ppic were constructed to demonstrate that the decreased virulence of sf <dig> was associated with the deletion of pic. using gentamicin protection assays, we showed that the hela cell invasion potential of the pic knockout strains, sf <dig> and sf301-∆ pic, was decreased compared with the wild-type sf <dig> strain. this decreased virulence was partially recovered by introducing psc-pic.

previous studies have demonstrated that purified recombinant protein pic ) is not involved in cytotoxic effects on ht29-c <dig> and hep- <dig> cells  <cit> . however, the findings from our current study show that both the clinical and constructed pic-deleted mutants possessed a decreased tendency for cell invasion compared with sf <dig>  virulence was partially recovered through the insertion of a complementary pic gene into these deletion mutants. because pic did not elicit cytopathic effects on epithelial cells, it may be associated with a less efficient interaction process with host cells, lacking any assistance from bacterial effectors. this phenomenon has also been observed by vidal et al.  <cit> , who examined the epec autotransporter espc. purified espc requires a higher concentration  and a longer incubation time  to produce the same cytotoxic effects as other epec isolates. further studies have confirmed that espc translocation into epithelial cells results in cytopathic effects in hela cells, but require participation of types iii and v secretion systems. the mechanism by which pic is interacted with epithelial cells remains unknown and warrants further study. further, differences in results observed with pic regarding decreases in cytopathic effects are likely also associated with other cell lines. differences in invasion efficiency between hela cells and hep- <dig> cells have been observed for streptococcus pyrogenes, campylobacter jejuni and salmonella typhimurium <cit> ; however, the reasons for these differences remain unclear, and further study is required to clarify this.

the mouse sereny test is commonly used to the test the invasiveness of shigella <cit> . in our work, the virulence of sf <dig> and sf301-∆ pic was obviously decreased. this was partially recovered by the introduction of psc-pic into deletion mutants. our findings support the conclusion that pic is associated with the invasion potential of s. flexneri 2a.

harrington et al.  <cit>  used a mouse model treated with streptomycin to show that pic promotes intestinal colonization by comparing intestinal colonization abilities of wild-type e. coli  <dig> and pic mutants . they demonstrated that the constructed mutants  contained significant defects that adversely affected colonization of mice gastrointestinal tracts compared with e. coli  <dig>  further work by harrington et al. suggested that a possible mechanism of promoting intestinal colonization depended on the mucinase activity of pic. they also showed that this effect is associated with the serine protease catalytic residue in pic. the research of harrington et al. supports our findings that pic is involved in bacterial invasion ability. whether a decrease in virulence is associated with the mucinase activity of pic, or other biological activities, should be investigated further.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that pic, located on pai- <dig> of s. flexneri 2a, plays a role in cell invasion during shigella infections. further work is necessary to elucidate how pic affects host-pathogen interactions, and how pic assists s. flexneri 2a to invade intestinal epithelial cells and cause cytopathic effects.
