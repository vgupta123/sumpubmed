BACKGROUND
the use of current high-density microarrays for genomic association studies leads to the simultaneous evaluation of a huge number of statistical hypotheses. thus, one of the main problems faced by the investigator is the selection of genes  worthy of further analysis taking multiple testing into account.

although the oldest extension of the classical type i error rate is the family-wise error rate , which is defined as the probability of falsely rejecting at least one null hypothesis , fwer-based procedures are often too conservative, particularly when numerous hypotheses are tested  <cit> . as an alternative and less stringent error criterion, benjamini and hochberg introduced, in their seminal paper  <cit> , the false discovery rate , which is defined as the expected proportion of false discoveries among all discoveries. here, a discovery refers to a rejected null hypothesis.

assuming that the test statistics are independent and identically distributed under the null hypothesis, storey  <cit>  demonstrated that, for a fixed rejection region Γ, which is considered to be the same for every test, the fdr is asymptotically equal to the following posterior probability:

 fdr = pr 

where h is the random variable such that h =  <dig> if the null hypothesis, noted h <dig>  is true; h =  <dig> if the alternative hypothesis, noted h <dig>  is true; and t is the test statistic considered for all tested hypotheses. however, one drawback is that the fdr criterion associated with a particular rejection region Γ refers to all the test statistics within the region without distinguishing between those that are close to the boundary and those that are not  <cit> .

for this purpose, efron  <cit>  introduced a new error criterion called the local false discovery rate  which can be interpreted as a variant of benjamini-hochberg's fdr, that gives each tested null hypothesis its own measure of significance. while the fdr is defined for a whole rejection region, the lfdr is defined for a particular value of the test statistic. more formally:

 lfdr = pr. 

as discussed by efron  <cit> , the local nature of the lfdr is an advantage for interpreting results from individual test statistics. moreover, the fdr is the conditional expectation of the lfdr given t ∈ Γ:

 fdr = e|t ∈ Γ). 

in this context, most of the published procedures for estimating lfdr proceed from a two-component mixture model approach, in which the marginal distribution of the test statistic can be written:

 f = π0f <dig> + f <dig>  

here, f <dig> and f <dig> are the conditional density functions corresponding to null and alternative hypotheses, respectively, and π <dig> = pr. using these notations, lfdr can be expressed as:

 lfdr=π0f0f.

a variety of estimators have been proposed that either consider a full model-based approach  or estimate an upper bound of lfdr without any assumption for f <dig>  it is worth noting that, in this latter framework, the probability π <dig> is not identifiable  <cit> . thus, from equation , only an upper bound estimate can be obtained for lfdr.

four procedures that do not require a distributional hypothesis for f <dig> were introduced by efron  <cit> , aubert et al.  <cit> , scheid and spang  <cit>  and broberg  <cit> . these methods are based on the separate estimations of π <dig>  f <dig> and f from the calculated p-values. for the last three procedures  <cit> , the p-values are supposed to be uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, while efron's approach estimates f <dig> from the observed data.

herein, we describe a novel and efficient procedure for estimating lfdr. while classical approaches are based on the estimation of the marginal density f, we propose directly estimating π <dig> and 1/f  within the same framework.

to situate our procedure among the four published, we briefly recall below their individual principles.

efron   <cit> 
for this procedure, the p-values are transformed into z-values for which the theoretical distribution  is a standard normal distribution. to take into account that f <dig> may be different from the theoretical null distribution, the parameters are estimated from the observed distribution of the z-values as summarized below.

the density f is non-parametrically estimated using a general poisson linear model, in which log) is modeled as a natural spline function with seven degrees of freedom. then, the null distribution parameters are estimated as follows. the expectation is taken as arg max) and the variance is deduced by quadratically approximating log) for central z-values  is supposed to be null). the proportion π <dig> is then estimated by the ratio of the means f¯/f0¯

assuming that the p-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis , the procedure is based on the separate estimations of π <dig> and f .

scheid and spang   <cit> 
as for the procedure proposed by aubert et al., the p-values are supposed to be uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. thus, this procedure is based on the separate estimations of π <dig> and f . the marginal distribution f is estimated by dividing the interval  <cit>  into  <dig> equidistant bins from which a corresponding histogram is derived. a smoothing spline with seven degrees of freedom is then used to estimate f.

the probability π <dig> is estimated by a stochastic downhill algorithm  with the intention of finding the largest subset of genes that could follow a uniform distribution. a penalized kolmogoroff-smirnoff score related to the uniform distribution is calculated for the whole gene set:

 s=max⁡i∈j|fj−ui|+λm−|j|mlog⁡

where m is the total number of genes, j is the set of genes under consideration , fj is the empirical cumulative distribution for the set j, and λ is a tuning parameter adaptively chosen . then, iteratively, genes are excluded so that the kolmogoroff-smirnoff score decreases. in practice, the procedure stops when the score is not reduced in 2m iterations. the score penalty takes into account the sample size m and avoids overfitting. at the end of the procedure, π <dig> is estimated by the proportion of the remaining genes. then, lfdr is estimated by lfdr_=π0_/f^

the procedure proposed by broberg to estimate lfdr is also based on the assumption that the p-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. then, as for the two previous methods, the procedure is based on the separate estimations of π <dig> and f . the marginal density f of the p-values is estimated by a poisson regression, similar to the procedure proposed by efron. to enforce monotony, broberg proposed using the pooling adjacent violators algorithm .

limitations of these estimators
through different estimations of π <dig>  f <dig> and f, these four procedures attempt to estimate an upper bound of lfdr. however, each of these methods has its own drawback. efron's procedure  <cit>  is restricted to situations in which π <dig> > 90%. the method of aubert et al.  <cit>  yields an estimator with a large variance. sheid and spang's procedure  <cit>  is based on an iterative algorithm and requires extensive computational time . finally, broberg's approach  <cit>  sometimes substantially underestimates lfdr. our procedure, developed in details under methods, is based on a polynomial regression under monotony and convexity constraints of the inverse function of the empirical cumulative distribution. thus, an estimated upper bound of lfdr with small variability can be expected, regardless of the true value of π <dig> 

RESULTS
here, we compared, through simulations, our method to the four procedures described above. the five procedures are then applied to real datasets.

simulated data
to compare our new estimator to the four previously published procedures, we performed a simulation study. data were generated to mimic a two-class comparison study with normalized log-ratio measurements for m genes  obtained from  <dig> experiments corresponding to two conditions , each with  <dig> replicated samples , which corresponds to classical sample sizes for differential gene-expression studies. two total numbers of genes were considered: one small  and one larger . in each case, all values were independently sampled from a normal distribution, xi,j,k ~ n. for the first condition , all data were simulated with μi <dig> =  <dig>  for the second condition , a proportion π <dig> of genes was simulated with μi <dig> =  <dig> , while modified genes were simulated using three different configurations:  μi <dig> =  <dig> for the first half, μi <dig> =  <dig> for the second half;  μi <dig> =  <dig>  for the first half, μi <dig> =  <dig> for the second half; and  μi <dig> =  <dig>  for the first third, μi <dig> =  <dig> for the second third and μi <dig> =  <dig> for the last third.

in this way, we tried to mimic realistic situations with different patterns. here, the distribution of modified genes is a simple mixture of two components with small expression differences ) and large expression differences ), or a more complex mixture with three components ).

four different π <dig> values were considered. because efron's procedure was developed for situations with π <dig> values greater than  <dig> , we used π <dig> =  <dig>  and π <dig> =  <dig> . we also considered two lower values of π <dig> that correspond to realistic situations not considered by efron . in total,  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig> different cases were considered.

to evaluate the behavior of the five procedures in the context of dependent data, we also generated datasets with so-called clumpy dependence .

we applied the protocol described in  <cit>  and  <cit>  as follows: first, an independent dataset matrix  was generated, as described above. then, for each group of  <dig> genes, a random vector a = {ajk}, where j =  <dig>   <dig> and k =  <dig> ...,  <dig> was generated from a standard normal distribution. the data matrix  was then built so that: yijk=ρajk+1−ρxijk

in each case, the p-values, calculated under the null hypothesis h <dig> : μi <dig> = μi <dig>  were obtained from the student's statistic. then, we estimated lfdr from our procedure, referred to as polfdr, and the four procedures presented in the background section, referred to as locfdr , localfdr , twilight , pava.fdr . although these procedures were not designed to estimate the probability π <dig> independently of lfdr, we also compared the estimators of π <dig> obtained from the five procedures.

for each case,  <dig>  datasets were simulated. to compare the different estimators, we considered three different criteria that are described below.

criterion 1
since the main contribution of lfdr is that it gives each tested hypothesis its own measure of significance, a small bias for any value within the whole interval  <cit>  can be preferable to a smaller bias limited to a subset of values within the interval. for this purpose and to assess the amplitude of the bias for the five procedures, we considered the infinity norm of the integrated error over the interval  <cit>  defined as follows:

the estimated values of b <dig> for independent data are reported in the table  <dig>  although these values were always less than or equal to  <dig>  for the polfdr procedure, the highest b <dig> values for the localfdr, pava.fdr, twilight and locfdr procedures were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these results also showed that the locfdr method tended to substantially overestimate ldfr. for example, figure  <dig> shows the expected lfdr as a function of p for each estimator with m =  <dig>  π <dig> =  <dig>  and configuration  . for these figures, the horizontal scale was log-transformed to better demonstrate the differences between the methods for small p-values. for dependent datasets, the bias of the five estimators increased. while the bias of our estimator was always less than or equal to  <dig> , the highest bias values for the methods pava.fdr, localfdr, twilight, locfdr were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

criterion 2
as noted under background, the five methods were designed to estimate an lfdr upper bound. however, a negative bias can occur in some cases, leading to more false positive results than expected. in this context, we propose investigating with the five procedures the minimal negative bias, denoted b <dig>  over the interval  <cit> :

results for independent datasets  indicated that all the estimators have non-negligible minimal negative biases. however, while b <dig> was always less than or equal to  <dig>  for our method, the maximal b <dig> values were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the estimators locfdr, localfdr, pava.fdr and twilight, respectively. more precisely, while our estimator slightly underestimated lfdr in some cases, when π <dig> was close to  <dig>  the twilight method tended to underestimate lfdr for small p-values  and the pava.fdr method tended to substantially underestimate lfdr for all p-values . the pava.fdr method underestimation can be attributed to the upper bound of π <dig>  which is estimated by min[f^

as shown in table  <dig>  these results indicated that, except for the pava.fdr method , our method gave the lowest rmise in 15/ <dig> cases. for the  <dig> cases with π <dig> close to one , the locfdr method yielded the lowest rmise. for the last  <dig> cases, the difference between our method's rmise and the lowest value  did not exceed  <dig> % . moreover, these results also indicated that the localfdr estimator, despite a small bias in all cases had a higher rmise than our estimator due to its wide variance.

for dependent data, the rmise of the five estimators increased and the differences were smaller. our method yielded the lowest rmise for 7/ <dig> cases .

however, because in practice, some investigators might want to select only genes with low lfdr, we also reported the results obtained with the  <dig> criteria over the interval  . they showed that our method maintained good performances compared to the four others. other thresholds for the p-values were considered  and gave similar results .

to compare the performance of the different estimators of the parameter π <dig> obtained with the different methods, we evaluated their expectations and their root mean square errors.

the estimated root mean square errors for each estimator of the parameter π <dig> are given in table  <dig>  note that the root mean square errors of our estimator were less than or equal to  <dig>  for the  <dig> simulated datasets, while it could reach  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for locfdr, localfdr, twilight and pava.fdr methods, respectively.

concerning computing time, our procedure was rapid, while the twilight method was cumbersome and impracticably long for large numbers of tested hypotheses. for example, the means of computing times on a personal computer  for m =  <dig>   <dig>  π <dig> =  <dig>  and configuration  were 50s, 2s, 1s, 1s and 1s for the methods twilight, localfdr, polfdr, pava.fdr and locfdr, respectively. for a larger number tested hypotheses m =  <dig>   <dig> , the means of computing times were  <dig> s, 162s, 108s, 2s and 1s, respectively.

real data
our method, together with twilight, localfdr, locfdr and pava.fdr, was applied to two datasets from genomic breast-cancer studies .

data from hedenfalk et al.  <cit> 
hedenfalk et al.  <cit>  investigated the gene-expression changes between hereditary  and non-hereditary breast cancers. the initial dataset consists of  <dig>  genes with expression log-ratios corresponding to the fluorescent intensities from a tumor sample divided by those from a common reference sample. like aubert et al.  <cit> , we focused on the comparison of brca <dig> and brca <dig>  and used the same p-values which were calculated for each gene from a two-sample t-test.

data from wang et al.  <cit> 
wang et al.  <cit>  wanted to provide quantitative gene-expression combinations to predict disease outcomes for patients with lymph-node negative breast cancers. over  <dig>  expression measurements were obtained from affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray u133a genechips for  <dig> samples. the expression values calculated by the affymetrix genechip analysis software mas <dig> are available on the geo website  <cit>  with clinical data. for normalisation, the quantile method  <cit>  was applied on log-transformed data.

here, we focused on identifying gene-expression changes that distinguish patients who experienced a tumour relapse within  <dig> years, from patients who continued to be disease-free after a period of at least  <dig> years. the p-values were calculated for each gene from a two-sample t-test and the five methods were applied.

discussion
in the simulations, for independent datasets, the results indicated good performances for our procedure compared to the four previously published methods. indeed, while the infinity norm b <dig> was small in every simulated case with our procedure, it could be large for twilight and locfdr procedures. moreover, despite the fact that the five estimators were designed with conservative biases, the twilight procedure could generate substantial negative bias for small p-values, the locfdr procedure underestimated the lfdr for p-values close to  <dig>  and pava.fdr tended to underestimate lfdr for all p-values. in addition, and compared to localfdr, our method gave smaller rmise in all cases. when considering only the lowest p-values, the simulation results showed the same trend. in summary, our new estimator exhibited more stable behavior than the four others.

for dependent datasets, simulation results led to similar conclusions. indeed, correlations between genes do not affect the marginal distribution of the p-values but increase the variability of the different methods and the bias of the estimators of π <dig> 

it is worth noting that a major assumption underlying our procedure, like twilight, localfdr and pava.fdr, relies on the distribution of the p-values under the null hypothesis. because the uniformity assumption is sometimes not tenable  <cit> , efron's procedure estimates the null distribution parameters from the observed marginal distribution. however, a limitation of that approach is the need for additional assumptions concerning the proportion of true null hypotheses. another way to address the problem of the null distribution is how the p-values are calculated, notably using sampling methods .

CONCLUSIONS
herein, we proposed a novel, simple and efficient procedure for estimating the lfdr. estimating its value is essential for genomic studies, as it quantifies gene-specific evidence for being associated with the clinical or biological variable of interest. moreover, it enables calculation of the fdr.

as seen from the simulation results, our new estimator performed well in comparison to locfdr, twilight, localfdr and pava.fdr. as discussed above, our method yielded a positive bias for lfdr that reflects the conservative estimation of the probability π <dig>  however, this limitation is compensated for by the fact that no assumption is required for f <dig> 

finally, we think that extending our approach to multidimensional settings could be useful, as recently discussed by ploner et al.  <cit> , but will require additional investigations.

the r function polfdr that implements the procedure is available on the polfdr website  <cit> .
