BACKGROUND
phytophthora capsici is a phytopathogenic oomycete that causes severe disease in a wide variety of plant species. during infection, pathogens produce a diverse range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, including cellulases, hemicellulases and pectinases  <cit> . pectinases can degrade pectin which is a major component of the primary cell wall and middle lamella of plants. according to the action mode, pectinase can be divided into three different types: polygalacturonase, pectin methyl esterase and pectate lyase   <cit> .

pectate lyases , which cleave glycosidic bonds of pectate or low methylated pectin by a trans-eliminative mechanism to yield unsaturated products, are widely distributed among microorganisms, such as p. capsici <cit> . pels are enzymes which specifically catalyze the cleavage of the α- <dig> -glycosidic linkages in the unesterified polygalacturonic acid  regions of plant cell walls and produce an unsaturated bond between c <dig> and c <dig> of each d-galacturonic acid unit  <cit> , resulting in tissue maceration and cell death due to osmotic fragility  <cit> . polysaccharide lyases are classified into  <dig> different families, including five families of pels identified as family number  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . pels are distinguished by both specificity for a glycosidic linkage and different optimal ph  <cit> . most pels are active in the ph range 8- <dig>  and ca2+ is required for enzymatic activity  <cit> , while some members depend on co2+, mn2+, and ni2+ <cit> .

besides playing an important role in the infection process of various pathogens and fruit ripening, pels have great commercial significance in industrial applications, such as extraction and clarification of fruit juices  <cit> , maceration of vegetables, scoring of cotton fabric, and retting of flax  <cit> . there is a high interest to improve the quality and efficiency of the pels for industrial applications.

genes encoding pels have been cloned from a variety of species, including erwinia chrysanthemi <cit> , zinnia elegans <cit> , meloidogyne javanica <cit> , strawberry  <cit> , etc. some have been further characterized by tertiary structure of the protein sequence and biochemical properties of the enzyme  <cit> . most of the pels were expressed as soluble recombinant proteins, such as pelw  <cit>  and pelc  <cit>  expressed in prokaryotic organism, and pel <dig>  <cit>  expressed in eukaryotic cells. a few recombinant proteins were insoluble  <cit> , and the inclusion bodies required solubilization in  <dig> m urea.

preparation of large-scale soluble protein can provide a basis for detailed structural and functional studies and ultimately improve our understanding of pel. in the present study, we report the expression and purification of a new pel from p. capsici using the pet and the pmal systems. we identified important differences in the characteristics of the recombinant pels produced by these two methods.

RESULTS
expression and purification of  <dig> × his-pcpel2
the mature fragment of pcpel <dig>  without introns was obtained and cloned into a pet28a expression vector. the recombinant plasmid was transformed into e. coli bl <dig>  plyss cells, following by induction under the t <dig> promoter with  <dig> mm iptg for  <dig> h at 16°c. the predicted molecular mass of the recombinant protein  <dig> × his-pcpel <dig> is  <dig> kda. after being lysed by sonication, there was little target protein  in supernatant at ph  <dig> - <dig>  buffer  . the insoluble particles were solubilized with buffer a , and then most of the expressed recombinant proteins were soluble . both the higher ph  and the urea were essential for the solubilization of the recombinant protein  <dig> × his-pcpel <dig>  after a series of purification steps , the purified protein was more than 90% purity by sds-page stained with coomassie brilliant blue . analysis by sds-page showed a significant amount of a  <dig> kda protein containing a  <dig> × his tag at the n-terminus of pcpel <dig>  in agreement with the predicted molecular weight for this protein. the protein was also recognized by western blot analysis .

a the starting material was  <dig> l of crude e. coli supernatant.

b enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced a change in absorbance of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm/min, as determined by the formation of unsaturated uronide.

expression and purification of mbp-pcpel2
pcpel <dig> was over-expressed as a soluble protein in e. coli using pmal expression system. it is shown from sds-page analysis that cell lysate dominantly reveals a  <dig> kda band , corresponding  <dig> kda mbp plus  <dig> kda pcpel <dig>  the expressed mbp-pcpel <dig> comprised 40% of the total protein, most of which was soluble. the soluble fusion protein dissolved in buffer  <dig>  was firstly purified by amylose resin column based on mbp affinity . to remove the affinity tag from fusion protein mbp-pcpel <dig>  an enzymatic cleavage procedure was conducted with human rhinovirus 3c protease, a protease specific for a spacer sequence between mbp and pcpel <dig>  the result implies that the human rhinovirus 3c protease can efficiently cleave the corresponding tag fused to the target protein. to separate the pcpel <dig> from the enzymatic mixture of mbp-pcpel <dig>  we tried a method of amylose re-affinity. the pcpel <dig> purity was about 95% and showed a significant amount of a  <dig> kda protein, as analyzed by sds-page . the protein was further verified by western blot analysis .

in vitro and in vivo activity assay
the activity of the purified pcpel <dig> was analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. the specific activity towards polygalacturonic acid of the purified pcpel <dig> that was produced using the pet system and the pmal system was  <dig> u/mg and  <dig> u/mg, respectively. in the in vivo activity assay, the presence of lesions in the positive control leaves  was regarded as a typical disease symptom compared with the treated leaves. the treated leaves began to display small necrotic spots at the second day after treatment  with pcpel <dig>  and the necrotic lesions expanded gradually and visible necrotic lesions appeared after  <dig> dat . in addition, the mean lesion area treated with the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pmal system was significantly bigger  than that of treated with the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pet system, in agreement with the specific activities. pcpel <dig> could induce necrotic lesions on the pepper leaves, resulting in pathogenic symptoms. the results confirm that pcpel <dig> is likely to soften pepper tissues and may cause death of plant cells, and might be one of the pathogenicity factors during infection of p. capsici.

crystallization of pcpel2
the purified pcpel <dig> obtained by the two different ways was used for the crystallization trials. initial crystals of pcpel <dig>  appeared using the purified protein expressed by the pmal system. the lower ph and higher purity of the pcpel <dig> produced by the pmal system compared to the purified protein expressed by the pet system may have contributed to the good crystallization of the former pcpel <dig>  the crystals were grown in drops with  <dig>  m hepes , 10%  polyethylene glycol  <dig>  5%  -2-methy- <dig> -pentanediol. high quality crystals of pcpel <dig> would be necessarily optimized in order to get a good x-ray diffraction data set for the structure determination. the work is in progress.

characterization comparison of the two purified pcpel2
the buffer dissolved the pcpel <dig> and the purity of the purified pcpel <dig> differed from the two systems. as far as pcpel <dig> expressed by the pet system, the higher ph  and the urea  were essential during the purification steps, and the urea could be removed gradually by dialysis. the above steps were unnecessary for the pcpel <dig> expressed by the pmal system since the mbp tag can increase the solubility of target protein. specific activities of purified pcpel <dig> compared favorably at  <dig> and  <dig> u/mg protein, respectively . in addition, both the two purified pcpel <dig> were able to induce necrotic lesions on the pepper leaves, but the necrotic lesions were different from the typical phytophthora foliar blight symptoms as observed in the positive control. the different symptoms are possibly because p. capsici is likely to be producing a series of pathogenesis-related enzymes to initiate host cell death, while the pcpel <dig> is a single pathogenicity factor to soften pepper tissues. the two purified pcpel <dig> showed differences in infectious characteristic, the mean lesion area treated with the higher activity pcpel <dig> was distinctly bigger than that of treated with the lower activity protein, suggesting the virulence of pcpel <dig> enzyme is related to its activity. crystals of pcpel <dig> were grown using the purified protein expressed by the pmal system, while no crystals appeared using the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pet system. in conclusion, the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pmal system contributed to the higher specific activity, pathogenicity and crystallization.

a the starting material was  <dig> l of crude e. coli supernatant.

b enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced a change in absorbance of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm/min, as determined by the formation of unsaturated uronide.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we cloned a new pectate lyase gene  from p. capsici. pcpel <dig> was expressed by two different systems, pet and pmal systems. the recombinant products were purified using affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. the purity, specific activity and pathogenicity of the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pmal system were higher than the purified pcpel <dig> expressed by the pet system. in addition, some other characteristics of the purified pcpel <dig> differed from the two systems, such as crystallographic features. using different methods and comparison of the products would be highly valuable in obtaining an ideal enzyme for the downstream experiments.
