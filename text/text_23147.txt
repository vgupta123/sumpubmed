BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is a highly heterogeneous species, as shown the extensive literature on the taxonomy and phylogeny of this species  <cit> . these studies include saprophytic, rhizopheric and phytopathogenic strains of p. fluorescens, illustrating the ubiquity of this species. most studies describe p. fluorescens as a psychrotrophic bacterium unable to grow at temperatures greater than 32°c and therefore as an avirulent bacterium in humans. nevertheless, previous studies of the infectious potential of p. fluorescens have demonstrated that the rifampicin spontaneous mutant mf <dig>  <cit>  derived from the environmental psychrotrophic strain mf <dig>  <cit>  can bind specifically to the surface of neurons and glial cells  <cit> . this adhesion to the host cell is associated with the induction of apoptosis and necrosis in glial cells  <cit> . lipopolysaccharides  produced or released by p. fluorescens have a clear role in cytotoxicity, but other factors released at the same time during adhesion also seem to be essential for the virulence of this bacterium  <cit> . thus the various enzymes secreted by this species may also be considered as potential high virulence factors  <cit> .

we recently demonstrated that the clinical strain mfn <dig> is a pseudomonas fluorescens sensus stricto biovar <dig> strain able to grow at 37°c  <cit> . this strain has hemolytic activity mediated by secreted factors, similar to the hemolytic activity seen for the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, involving phospholipase c  and biosurfactant  <cit> . under specific conditions, mfn <dig> forms colonies of phenotypic variants, which are defective in secreted hemolysis. spontaneous mutations of the genes encoding the two-component regulatory system gacs/gaca have been identified as the cause of phenotypic variation in one such group of variants. we hypothesized that phenotypic variation increases the virulence potential of this strain. however these group variants  do not produce secondary metabolites and have impaired biofilm formation  <cit> . then, these results suggested that virulence of mfn <dig> is not dependent solely on secreted factors or lps and thus must involve other factors.

some bacterial virulence factors are only expressed in the presence of eukaryotic cells. this is the case of the type iii secretion system , one of the most frequently described contact dependent secretion systems in pseudomonas. ttsss are found in many gram-negative pathogens. they allow the direct translocation of bacterial effector proteins into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells. p. aeruginosa uses the ttss to translocate four effector proteins  with antihost properties  <cit> . the p. aeruginosa ttss consists of nearly  <dig> genes, regulated in a coordinated manner and encoding structural components of the secretion and translocation machinery, effectors proteins, and regulatory factors  <cit> . transcription of the ttss is induced under calcium-limited growth conditions or following intimate contact of p. aeruginosa with eukaryotic host cells  <cit> . pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> is a phytopathogenic bacterium that harbors a gene cluster hrp . this hrp cluster is essential for pathogenicity in susceptible plants and for the ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in nonhosts or resistant cultivars of host plants  <cit> . hrp genes are expressed in planta or in media mimicking plant apoptotic conditions  <cit> . sequence analyses have uncovered a shared subset of nine hrp genes that were renamed hrc  and that encode proteins homologous to yersinia ysc gene products  <cit> . the existence of these genes suggests evolutionary conservation of molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity used by both mammalian and phytopathogenic bacteria  <cit> .

in p. fluorescens, the presence of the hrc genes belonging to hrpu operon depends on the strain. the feature of ttss and the origin of hrc genes remain to clarify in this species  <cit> .

in the present study, we describe the detection of cell-associated hemolytic activity of p. fluorescens mfn <dig> in contact with sheep erythrocytes. this hemolytic activity was compared with the hemolytic activity of other p. fluorescens strains: a spontaneous mfn <dig> gaca mutant and the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa cha  <cit> . cell-associated hemolytic activity and its regulation were compared with the activity and regulation of the previously described secreted hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  we then looked for hrc genes in our strain and determined their role in the cell-associated hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  using hrpu operon disruption mutant.

RESULTS
mfn <dig> displays cell-associated hemolytic activity
hemolytic activity of pseudomonas fluorescens biovar i mfn <dig> and pseudomonas aeruginosa cha  was measured by the technique employed by dacheux  <cit> , adapted as described in methods.

bacteria were grown at 37°c to mid exponential growth phase and were used at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  without spin . cha induced lysis of 5% of red blood cells  and mfn <dig>  50% lysis, within  <dig> hour at 37°c. hemolytic activity of cha was increased by a  <dig> min centrifugation at  <dig> g  or  <dig> g . by contrast, the hemolytic activity of mfn <dig> was unchanged after a  <dig> min centrifugation at  <dig> g and reduced by centrifugation at  <dig> g  . for further experiments we used a  <dig> min centrifugation at  <dig> g since this protocol is allowing close contact between bacterial cells and rbcs and appears compatible with maximum lysis by mfn <dig>  supernatants from mfn <dig> cells tested in the same conditions had no hemolytic activity. additionally, we collected supernatants from rbc lysed by mfn <dig>  supernatants were filtered and incubated with fresh rbcs for  <dig> h at 37°c. this supernatant from lysed rbc samples did not induce further rbc lysis. thus, the factor mediating rbc lysis is not a factor released into the supernatant, but is dependent on the presence of mfn <dig> cells.

mfn <dig> cells from cultures grown to the exponential growth phase at various temperatures were incubated with rbcs for  <dig> h at 37°c. mfn <dig> bacteria grown at 17°c and 37°c showed the same levels of hemolysis , whereas bacteria grown at 8°c were almost devoid of hemolytic activity . the maximal hemolytic activity of mfn <dig> was observed at 28°c , the optimal growth temperature of this strain .

lysis of rbcs is caused by a pore-forming toxin from mfn1032
we investigated the nature of the factor involved in rbc lysis by osmoprotection experiments. osmoprotectants protect rbcs against osmotic shock provoked by bacterial pore-forming toxins. we used different sized molecules in hemolysis experiments to estimate the size of the pore formed in the rbc membrane . we did not observe any effects on hemolysis with peg <dig>  peg <dig>  peg <dig> or peg <dig>  molecules larger than peg <dig> protected against mfn <dig> cell-associated hemolysis as observed for peg <dig>  a maximal level of protection was reached with peg <dig>  resulting in the protection of 90% of rbcs against this hemolytic process. based on these results, we estimated the size of the pore formed in rbc membranes by mfn <dig> is between  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm.

mfn <dig> cell-associated hemolytic activity is higher than in other pseudomonas fluorescens strains
we tested the hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  mfy <dig> , mfy <dig> and mfy <dig>   <cit> , mf <dig>  and c7r <dig>  cells at  <dig> and 37°c.

the hemolytic effect of mfn <dig> cells was much higher than the other strains tested, at both growth temperatures . at 28°c, mfy <dig> was the only other strain showing high levels of hemolytic activity ; mfy <dig> and mfy <dig> displayed only weak hemolytic activity . all clinical isolates showed some hemolytic activity  at 37°c, but at a lower level than that observed for mfn <dig> one's. the environmental strains tested were not hemolytic at 28°c and did not grow at 37°c.

the hemolytic activities of mfn <dig>  mfy <dig> and mfy <dig>  were maximal at their optimal growth temperature . the hemolytic activity of the strain mfy <dig> was the same at 28°c and 37°c.

involvement of the gac two-component system on cell-associated hemolytic activity
we investigated the possible involvement of the gac two-component system in the regulation of this cell-associated hemolytic activity using a group <dig> variant of mfn <dig>  v <dig>  this variant strain is a gaca mutant and has impaired secreted hemolytic activity  <cit> . v <dig> was tested with or without transformation by electroporation with plasmid carrying the gaca gene  or the parental plasmid pme <dig>  as a control  <cit>  .

the non-transformed v <dig> strain displayed enhanced hemolytic activity , using mfn <dig> as a reference value . introduction of a gaca gene in v <dig> cells by electroporation with pmp <dig> restored wild-type hemolytic levels.

mfn <dig> has hrcrst genes
the lysis of rbcs by a number of bacteria requires the formation of a pore in the erythrocyte membrane by ttss protein. to determine whether ttss-like genes are present in mfn <dig> and mf <dig>  we used pcr primers targeting hrpu operon,  encoding the conserved core proteins of fluorescent pseudomonas ttss, described by mazurier et al.  <cit> . the region amplified by these primers includes the 3'end of hrcr, hrcs and the 5'end of hrct.

a single fragment of  <dig>  kb was obtained for mfn <dig> and mf <dig> and cloned with the pmos kit. fragments were sequenced by genome express . sequences were registered in the genbank database  and named "hrc operon", partial sequence. these sequences predict an  <dig> residues hrcs protein in these two strains.

a ncbi nucleotide and protein database search showed that the putative hrcs from mfn <dig> was very similar to the putative mf <dig> hrcs  and to rscs , a type iii secretion protein from the pseudomonas fluorescens strain sbw <dig> , but is more distantly related to the hrcs of c7r <dig>  . the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> flip partial protein showed 47% identity.

ns: not significant 

effect of disruption of the hrpu operon
we investigated a possible link between this hrpu operon and the cell-associated hemolytic activity of mfn <dig>  we used a mutant strain, mfn <dig>  in which the hrpu operon was disrupted, to determine whether ttss proteins are required for the hemolytic activity observed in mfn <dig>  in this construction, the single homologue recombination provokes at least the deletion of the 5'-end of hrct  and of genes situated downstream hrct in this operon . we observed an almost total loss of cell-associated hemolytic activity  in the mutant strain. revertant of mfn <dig>  the strain mfn <dig>  had a restored hemolytic phenotype, showing activity levels similar to those of mfn <dig> . these results demonstrate a link between the hrpu operon and this cell-associated hemolytic activity in p. fluorescens mfn <dig> 

given the homology between hrcs and flip, we investigated the potential role of hrcrst genes in flagellar synthesis. the effect of disrupting the hrpu operon in mfn <dig> was measured in swimming mobility assays, as described in the methods. at 28°c, we observed no differences in swimming ability between mfn <dig>  mfn <dig> and mfn <dig> , suggesting that disruption of this operon has no effect on flagella motility.

discussion
to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate cell-associated hemolytic activity in clinical isolates of a pseudomonas fluorescens. p.fluorescens mfn <dig> cell in exponential growth phase displayed hemolytic activity at 37°c, whereas no hemolytic activity was detected using mfn <dig> supernatant. this hemolytic activity was thus dependent on the presence of mfn <dig> cells. mfn <dig> cells caused hemolysis of rbcs without requiring prior centrifugation to reduce the distance between bacterial and red cell membrane below a critical threshold. such a centrifugation step has previously been shown to be necessary to induce the "contact-dependent" hemolytic activity displayed by several other bacteria, for example yersinia  <cit> , shigella  <cit>  and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . in contrast, "induced" hemolysis does not require close rbc-bacterial contact for enteropathogenic escherichia coli epec, due to the long espa  filaments that form a connection between bacteria and host cells for protein translocation  <cit> . mfn <dig> hemolytic activity was not strictly contact-dependent but depended on the presence of mfn <dig> cells. we therefore propose the term "cell-associated" hemolytic activity.

this activity is independent of the secreted hemolytic activity previously described for this strain. for all tested conditions, we have previously demonstrated that secreted hemolytic activity only occurs at the end of the exponential growth phase  <cit> . mfn <dig> supernatants were not hemolytic at 37°c in vitro and hemolysis was maximal at 17°c. cell-associated hemolysis measured here was maximal during the exponential growth phase and retrieved at 37°c. moreover, a gaca mutant of mfn <dig> , for which several extracellular activities are impaired , showed increased cell-associated hemolytic activity. in psychrotrophic bacteria, most secreted enzymes are generally found at 17°c , whereas membrane-associated activities are enhanced with decreased generation time  <cit> . thus, the maximum expression of this new hemolytic activity at 28°c  is consistent with a cell surface associated process.

this hemolytic activity is not common to all pseudomonas fluorescens species. indeed, we only observed significant cell-associated hemolysis in the clinical strains mfn <dig> and mfy <dig> and not in the environmental strains tested. although our panel of studied strains is limited and can not be considered as representative, the presence of this activity seems to be dependent on strain origin, i.e clinical source. cell-associated hemolytic activity has been rarely observed in environmental strains. nevertheless, two hemolytic strains showing such phenotype have been described for plesiomonas shigelloides   <cit> .

we amplified ttss-like genes hrcrst from mfn <dig> and mf <dig> cells while p.fluorescens pfo- <dig> and pf <dig> strains  <cit>  lack the ttss genes found in related pathogens or plant-associated bacteria. hrpu operon-like has previously been found in the p. fluorescens strains kd  and sbw <dig>   <cit> . in one study of a group of fluorescent pseudomonas, ttss-like genes were detected in 75% of the phytopathogenic but only in 32% of the saprophytic strains tested  <cit> . the presence of hrcrst genes is not systematically correlated to hemolytic activity. indeed, p. fluorescens mf <dig> and c7r <dig> have similar hrcrst genes to mfn <dig> but are not hemolytic. thus, the presence of these genes does not strictly imply hemolytic function. lysis is dependent upon the ability of ttss translocator proteins to form a pore in the erythrocyte membrane causing hemoglobin leakage. the presence of these hrcrst genes does not necessarily result in the assembly of a functional ttss. some ttss genes are absent from sbw <dig> and ttss virulence genes in kd have been suggested to have been recently acquired horizontally from phytopathogenic bacteria and recycled for biocontrol function  <cit> .

ttss-dependent lysis of erythrocytes has been observed in a number of bacteria. contact-dependent hemolysis assays have been used to identify the genes required for a functional salmonella ttss  <dig>  <cit> . mfn <dig> cell-associated hemolytic activity shares common features with ttss-mediated hemolysis. the various mechanisms involved include formation of a pore with an estimated size of  <dig>  to  <dig>  nm, consistent with ttss-hemolysis mechanism previously described by dacheux for pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . mfn <dig> cells did not show this cell-associated hemolysis during the stationary growth phase. previous studies have shown a negative effect of high cell density, through a rpos-mediated mechanisms  <cit>  or by quorum-sensing  <cit> , on ttss gene expression in pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found increased hemolytic activity in the mfn <dig> gaca mutant . this result suggests that the gac two-component system is a negative regulator of cell-associated hemolytic activity. studies on ttss regulation in pseudomonas aeruginosa have demonstrated that the gaca response regulator inhibits ttss function and that, in a gaca mutant, the ttss effector exos is hypersecreted  <cit> . opposite, in pseudomonas syringae, gaca is a positive regulator of the ttss  <cit> . the homology between mfn <dig> genes and plant-associated ttss genes is not in favour of a direct negative transcriptional regulation by the system gac.

to investigate the potential role of ttss in this hemolytic process, we constructed a mutant with hrpu operon disruption, mfn <dig>  in which hemolytic activity was severely impaired. hemolysis was restored in revertant mfn <dig> cells, with hemolytic activity levels similar to wild type. thus, cell-associated hemolytic activity seems to require an intact hrpu operon. in contrast, hrpu operon disruption did not affect swimming motility, suggesting that hrpu operon is not involved in flagella biosynthesis. in mfn <dig> the single homologue recombinaison event with pme3087-hrcrst would result in, at least, a lack of hrct protein. in pseudomonas cichorri, an insertion of transposon in hrct was described as sufficient to lost virulence on eggplant  <cit> . this large insertion in mfn <dig> would have a polar effect on genes situated downstream this operon. in pseudomonas fluorescens, hrcrst genes are highly conserved. other genes of the hrpu operon, however, seem to vary considerably  <cit> . pcr experiments based on sbw <dig> and kd sequences did not lead to an amplification of any hrc genes located downstream or upstream hrcrst . an experiment of chromosome walking should allow us to identify these genes.

the hrcrst genes from pseudomonas fluorescens mfn <dig> show a high level of homology with hrcrst genes from pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogen. ttss-dependent pore formation is due to the insertion of the translocation pores into host cell membranes. in pseudomonas syringae, hrpzpsph forms pores in vitro and is exported by the ttss. however, when introduced into yersinia enterocolitica cells, this protein is exported via the yersinia sstt but cannot replace yopb functions and do not cause rbc hemolysis  <cit> . hrpz is unable to induce pore formation. moreover, in the two strains of pseudomonas fluorescens already described no hrpz homologue was found. we tried to amplify this gene with primers design from hprz from other pseudomonad, but without success.

the nature of the ttss component implicates in the cell hemolytic activity of mfn <dig> remains to be determined. we will address this issue in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
pseudomonas fluorescens mfn <dig> is a clinical strain isolate that displays two distinct types of hemolytic activity, described here for the first time. the first type is observed in the cell-free supernatant of rich media cultures at 28°c, whereas the second, cell-associated type of hemolysis, is detected at 37°c in the presence of erythrocytes. this strain has hrcrst genes, a feature that is not shared by all pseudomonas fluorescens strains. our study establishes an unexpected link between these hrc genes and cell-associated hemolytic activity. these initial findings are consistent, although not sufficient, to demonstrate that this cell-associated hemolysis is due to a functional ttss. investigation of type iii effector genes in the genome of this strain and the construction of targeted mutants are now needed to confirm these findings. nevertheless, this study suggests that certain strains of the highly heterogeneous species pseudomonas fluorescens, which is usually considered to be a saprophytic species, express virulence with characteristic of pathogenic species belonging to the pseudomonas genus. nevertheless the principal role of this ttss homologue to the one of plant-associated bacteria is probably not the pathogenicity against endotherms. the first target of this system would rather be unicellular eukaryotes of the rhizosphere, as mycetes or amoebas.
