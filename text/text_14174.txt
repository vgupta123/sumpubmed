BACKGROUND
the genus enterococcus is a diverse group of low gc% gram-positive bacteria that contains over  <dig> species. the genera include commensal species of the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals, and also environmental strains that can be isolated from soil, surface waters and plant material  <cit> . enterococci are nutritionally fastidious microorganisms, which are associated with a large variety of human activities. in this sense, several strains have technological relevance since they are present in dairy, meat and other fermented foods, and some of them show probiotic effects  <cit> . nevertheless, they are not “generally recognized as safe”  microorganisms for human consumption , even though they are phylogenetically related to the group of lactic acid bacteria . particularly during the last decade, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium strains emerged as opportunistic human pathogens frequently associated with nosocomial infections with a high capacity to disseminate antibiotic resistance  <cit> . as a consequence, information on genetics and physiology of these species has increased dramatically in recent years; however, little data is available regarding other enterococci.

enterococcus mundtii was described as a non-motile, yellow-pigmented enterococcus typically isolated from plant material, soil, cow teats and milker’s hands  <cit>  and infrequently associated to human infection  <cit> . as the rest of enterococci, they are facultative anaerobes and display a homolactic glucose metabolism. dna gc content ranges from  <dig> to 39%, as determined by the melting temperature method  <cit> . we have recently announced the draft genome sequence of e. mundtii strain crl <dig>  <cit> . this strain was isolated from stripping milk of an argentinean cow and, given its bacteriocinogenic capacity, it has been proposed as a probiotic microorganism to prevent mastitis in these mammals  <cit> .

during the last decade, the availability of bioinformatics approaches for comparison of multiple bacterial genomes allowed the analysis of a huge amount of sequence data. in this sense, the aim of the present study was to gain insight into the similarities between the genetic content of e. mundtii and other enterococcal species and, more specifically, to investigate genes coding for virulence factors shared with e. faecalis and e faecium species, frequently behaving as opportunistic pathogens.

methods
general inspection of the e. mundtiigenome
gene products putatively encoded by e. mundtii crl <dig> were identified using rast  <cit>  . in order to improve this sequence, a blastn approach  was performed and those contigs shorter than  <dig>  bp and with an homology higher than 99% with sequences already contained in a longer contig were deleted. in this manner,  <dig> contigs were removed from the database , resulting in a genome of  <dig>  mb . the remaining contigs were ordered and oriented with advanced pipmaker using e. faecalis v <dig> genome as a reference  <cit> . finally, contigs were concatenated, using a perl script designed ad hoc, by including the sequence nnnnncacacacttaattaattaagtgtgtgnnnnn, which harbors stop codons in all six reading frames  <cit> .

after annotation of each of the draft genomic sequences in rast , as explained for e. mundtii, comparative genome analysis against other enterococcal species was performed. e. mundtii unique genes were determined by using rast compare metabolic reconstruction tool  <cit> .table  <dig>

ani versus shared genes with similar function plot
ani values were calculated based on pairwise alignment of genome stretches using the jspecies software with blast algorithm  <cit> . calculation of ani values is implemented as described by goris j, et al.  <cit> . shared genes with similar function among each enterococcal species described in table  <dig> and e. mundtii were assessed using the compare metabolic reconstruction tool from rast server. genes which were associated within a rast subsystem for both microorganisms were considered as shared between them  <cit> .

study of genomic islands
the analysis considered to detect putative genome islands  was as follows. first, the regions detected by alien-hunter  <cit>  were selected and secondly, positives results obtained either by colombo/sigi-hmm  <cit>  or islandpath-dimob  <cit>  were taken as requirement for the next step. regions identified using this approach were manually inspected using artemis and dnaplotter  <cit>  in order to find out further evidences related to geis, in general, and pathogenic island , in particular  <cit> . a deviation in the g + c content frequency  plus the presence of insertion sequences and trna flanking regions jointly with transposases coding genes, which are important for dna incorporation processes, were accepted as further evidence of the presence of a gei. lastly, specific features of each gene located within the putative pai were determined. particularly, genes involved in virulence, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenic mechanisms were traced, using the blastp tool in the virulence factors data base server  <cit> . others functions of the features found in these regions were extracted from rast annotations.

phylogenetic tree construction
this analysis involved sequences from nine enterococci species  and the outgroup lactococcus lactis sk <dig>  orthologous proteins were assigned using the orthomcl software  <cit> . in case that a particular enterococcal species contained more than one protein from the same group of orthologs, only the protein with the lower e-value was considered for the alignment. concatenated orthologous protein sequences were aligned using clustalx  <cit> , and poorly aligned positions as well as excessively divergent regions were trimmed using gblock  <dig> b  <cit>  resulting in a final alignment containing a total of  <dig>  residues. finally, the evolutionary history was inferred by using the randomized axelerated maximum likelihood algorithm . dcmut with empirical base frequencies and gamma distribution were used as substitution model. reliability of the inferred tree was tested by bootstrapping with  <dig> replicates.

analysis of regulators
the presence of orthologs for putative regulator proteins of e. mundtii crl <dig> in e. faecalis v <dig> and e. faecium do genomes were determined as described in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  briefly, all protein sequences assigned as regulator proteins by rast were used as query in a blastp search over e. faecalis v <dig> and e. faecium do genome sequences. cut-off and cut-in values were established as described in additional file 1: figure s1c. then, e. faecalis v <dig> and e. faecium do proteins sharing an identity percentage with e. mundtii crl <dig> proteins higher than the cut-in value were considered as present in the e. mundtii genome while those with lower identity percentages were considered absent. proteins with shared identity between cut-in and cut-off values were further individually analyzed according to their gene context . for those e. mundtii crl <dig> proteins showing no homologs in e. faecium or e. faecalis a blastp was performed against a non-redundant database  with a bit-score cut-off of  <dig> 

semiqualitative comparison of potential virulence factors
for the enterococcal species described in table  <dig>  blastp analysis of their respective proteomes was made against the virulence factors data base  <cit> . the expectation value used as cut-off was 10− <dig>  only the first hit was recovered for each protein query.

galleria mellonellakilling assay
infection of galleria mellonella larvae with e. faecalis was accomplished as previously described by lebreton et al.  <cit> . briefly, using a syringe pump , larvae  were infected subcutaneously with washed e. faecalis jh2- <dig> or e. mundtii crl  <dig> cells from an exponential culture in lbg administered in 5 μl of sterile saline buffer. control groups of larvae received 5 μl of a saline solution only. in each test,  <dig> larvae were infected and the experiments were repeated at least three times. larval killing was monitored up to 89 hours post-infection. survival curves were constructed by the kaplan-meier method and compared by log-rank analysis . p values of < <dig>  were considered statistically significant  <cit> .

RESULTS
general features of the e. mundtiigenome and phylogenetic analysis
the genome sequence of e. mundtii strain crl <dig> was automatically annotated by using the rast server  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  coding sequences  and  <dig> structural rnas  were predicted by this method. putative biological roles have been assigned for  <dig>   of the orfs, whereas the remaining  <dig>  encode hypothetical proteins for which no probable function could be predicted. the general features of the genome are summarized in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> figure  <dig>

e. mundtii crl <dig> phylogeny was analyzed with a tree generated from the concatenated sequences of  <dig> core proteins from nine enterococci and the outgroup l. lactis sk <dig> . in this analysis we included representative enterococcal species of diverse origins, whose genomic sequences have been released . we observed that e. mundtii is more related to e. faecium, which is frequently associated with nosocomial infections.figure  <dig>

crl <dig>   core gene tree. clustalx aligned sequences of core concatenated proteins were used for the phylogeny reconstruction analysis of enterococci species using the randomized axelerated maximum likelihood  algorithm based on dcmut with empirical base frequencies and gamma distribution model. the reliability of the inferred tree was tested by bootstrapping with  <dig> replicates. the tree with the highest log likelihood  is shown. lactococcus lactis sk <dig> was included as outgroup species.  ani plot. shared genes with similar function and ani values between e. mundtii and the bacterial genomes of the indicated strains are plot. e. mundtii crl <dig> , l. lactis subsp. cremoris sk <dig> , e. italicus dsm <dig> , e. casseliflavus atcc <dig> , e. faecalis  <dig> , e. faecalis v <dig> , e. saccharolyticus atcc  <dig> , e. gallinarum eg <dig> , e. faecium com <dig> , and e. faecium do . the data set supporting the results of this article is available in the treebase repository, .



to further analyze the relationships among these enterococcal species, we constructed a plot of the shared genes with similar function between e. mundtii and the species under comparison versus average nucleotide identity  values . ani values are frequently used to verify prokaryotic species definitions  <cit> . as expected, these values were lower than the 94% accepted as a threshold for species designation  <cit> . e. faecium strains showed the highest ani values , with a content of shared genes with similar function between  <dig> and 46%. with respect to other enterococcal species, ani varies within a narrow range  and e. mundtii shared more genes with similar function with strains of non-clinical origin as e. casseliflavus atcc <dig> and e. saccharolyticus atcc  <dig> than the rest of the analyzed strains.

we were also interested in performing a bioinformatic quantification of genes horizontally transferred to the e. mundtii genome. according to the alien-hunter software, 39% of the genome was acquired by horizontal transfer. a list of genes coding for integrases, transposases and phage-related proteins found by the rast annotation is given in additional file 2: table s <dig>  in this regard, four gene clusters that fit the criteria as geis  were detected and are pointed out in figure  <dig>  gei i contains a putative cell wall surface anchor protein, that could be involved in adhesion and invasion mechanisms. interestingly, a gene for the bacteriocin mundticin was detected in the gei iii cluster, which is genetically linked to its immunity protein and transporter.

regarding genetically distinctive features of e. mundtii, a comparative analysis performed between strain crl <dig> and the other enterococcal species included in this study  revealed a set of  <dig> unique proteins with putative functions for this microorganism . among this group of proteins, besides the mundticin previously mentioned, two proteins that could be responsible for capsule biosynthesis  and a toxin-antitoxin maze-mazf system were detected.table  <dig>

e. mundtii
genome




identification of a gene encoding a putative bacteriocin
a cluster of three genes involved in bacteriocin synthesis and transport, which is unique to this microorganism, was found. these genes were designated muna, munb, and munc. the structural gene muna encodes a 58-aminoacid mundticin precursor. the mature peptide is a class iia mundticin with an estimated molecular weight of  <dig>  da and pi of  <dig> . the blastp protein database homology search on the 43-amino acid deduced mature peptide, mundticin  <dig>  revealed that its sequence is identical to that of the plasmid encoded-mundticin ks from e. mundtii nfri <dig>  <cit>  and a 95% identical to that of e. mundtii ato <dig>  <cit> . the pre-peptide contains a leader peptide of  <dig> amino acids with a consensus ggxaa processing site. the mature peptide contains the ygngv motif at positions 3– <dig>  characteristic of class iia bacteriocins. moreover, it contains the two cysteine residues  forming the disulfide bridge, which are well conserved in all class iia bacteriocins  <cit> .

the munb gene encodes a 674-amino acid polypeptide, which exhibits 98% of similarity with the 674-amino acid abc transporter munb found in e. mundtii nfri <dig>  involved in the maturation and excretion of enterocin ks  <cit> . the munc gene encodes a mundticin immunity protein of  <dig> amino acids, as evidenced by the close similarity to the immunity protein of mundticin ks  <cit> .

stress response systems
one of the most relevant characteristics of the enterococcus genus is its capacity to resist and grow at low ph. thus, we analyzed the presence of genes involved in the acidic stress response in the e. mundtii genome. we identified eight genes encoding the different subunits of the f0f1-atpase, which is also present in the enterococcal core genome previously described. this complex is involved in ph homeostasis through the generation of proton motive force by atp consumption  <cit> . the organization of these genes was the same as that for other enterococcal f0f1-atpases , where atpbef encode the a, c and b subunits of the membrane-bound f <dig> domain, whereas atphagdc genes encode the δ, α, γ, β y ϵ subunits of the cytoplasmic f <dig> domain, respectively  <cit> . in addition, the genome of e. mundtii possesses an operon constituted by nine genes  homologous to the ntp genes of e. hirae
 <cit>  encoding a na+-pumping v1v0-atpase. the v <dig> domain is a peripheral complex responsible for atp hydrolysis, and is constituted by a, b, c, d, e, f and g subunits. the v <dig> domain is an integral complex responsible for na+ translocation across the membrane.

furthermore, three gene clusters also indirectly involved in resistance to low ph were identified. one of them corresponds to the cit genes, homologous to those recently characterized in e faecalis, which are responsible for the degradation of citrate and are organized in two divergent putative operons . the first transcriptional unit contains genes encoding a gntr-family transcriptional regulator and a citrate permease belonging to the me2+-citmhs family . in the second operon, genes responsible for the codification of citrate lyase subunits , citrate lyase accessory genes  and a membrane oxaloacetate decarboxylase  were found. this genetic organization resembles that found in e. faecium, which differs from the e. faecalis cit locus in the position of another citrate lyase-accesory gene, citg, and also in the absence of the soluble oxaloacetate decarboxylase gene, citm. the second group of genes involves the mles , mlet  and mler  genes, which are required for the malolactic fermentation and show homology to those found in e. faecium
 <cit> . finally, genes associated to the arginine deiminase pathway , which generates atp and contributes to low-ph resistance, were identified. these genes are present in the core genome of selected enterococci and code for the three main enzymes of the system, arginine deiminase, ornithine transcarbamylase and carbamate kinase. additionally, we identified a homologue to arcr divergently oriented, which encodes an activator of the adi system . besides, a homologue of the arginine-ornithine transporter  of lactococcus garvieae atcc  <dig> was identified in another genomic region of e. mundtii.

other related proteins required for optimal stress resistance were identified in the genome of e muntdii: reca, a mediator of homologous recombination and regulator of the sos response, chaperonins groel and groes, htra, a protein involved in proteolysis of abnormal proteins synthesized under stressful conditions, the enzymes involved in the synthesis of d-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid , and the diacylglycerol kinase dagk, involved in acid resistance  <cit> .table  <dig>

analysis of regulators
since adaptation to different niches requires a fine-tuning of gene expression, we searched for regulators responsible for sensing the bacterial environmental milieu and physiological state. by knowing the set of regulators shared by related bacteria and detecting the presence of those that are unique, it is possible to infer the common and specific characteristics of niches and lifestyle among them. in the attempt to study the complete set of regulators encoded by the e. mundtii genome, a database consisting of  <dig> genes was constructed  and a comparative analysis against e. faecalis v <dig> and e. faecium do was performed.

core regulators
 <dig>  of the analyzed genes were found in the three genomes . although  <dig> of these genes are not assigned to any rast subsystems, the rest of them were implied in diverse functions including sugar uptake and utilization , anabolic pathways , amine compounds degradation , atp-dependent proteolysis, phosphate uptake, competence, heme and hemin uptake and utilization systems, metal homeostasis/resistance  and oxidative stress .

non-core regulators
 <dig> genes  of the analyzed regulators were found in e. mundtii and e. faecium  or e. faecalis  but not in the three genomes at the same time . although higher cut-in and cut-off values were used for ortholog assignment to e. faecium with respect to e. faecalis , higher numbers of orthologs were found in the former, which correlates with the closer phylogenetic relationship between the species. while  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes are not assigned to any rast subsystems, the remaining  <dig> were assigned to diverse functions including sugar uptake and utilization , heme and hemin uptake and utilization systems, degradation of amine compounds , organic acid metabolism  and oxidative stress .

e. mundtii species-specific regulators
 <dig> gene orthologs  could not be found in e. faecium or e. faecalis, and  <dig>  of these genes have orthologs in other lab. the remaining genes only have orthologs in phylogenetically more distant bacteria . although none of these genes belong to a rast subsystem, a preliminary sinteny analysis assigned them to functions related to carbon compound utilization , anabolic pathways , cell surface functions, abc-type transporters and other roles  .

among all the transcriptional regulators found in the e. mundtii genome, there is a subset corresponding to response regulators  putatively forming part of two-component signal transduction systems . the importance of tcs for the ability of e. faecalis to respond to environmental stimuli has been previously stressed by hancock and perego  <cit> . the e. mundtii genome contains putative genes coding for  <dig> tcs and one orphan response regulator . we found e. faecalis homologues for  <dig> of the e. mundtii tcs and also for the orphan rr. as a general rule for most bacterial sensor kinases, all of the hk in e. mundtii were predicted to be membrane localized . among the remaining hk, one  showed homology to proteins present in environmental enterococci, and hks iiia-i and j presented homology to sensors encoded by e. faecium. this analysis suggests that the set of tcs present in e. mundtii is highly similar to that encoded by other enterococcal species.

identification of genes involved in pigmentation
e. mundtti crl <dig> shows a characteristic yellowish pigmentation on agar plates, originated by the production of carotenoids as reported for other enterococcus species  <cit> . genes responsible for carotenoid production have been previously described in staphylococcus aureus
 <cit>  and lactobacillus plantarum
 <cit> . it has been shown that crtm and crtn constitute a bicistronic operon encoding the enzymes responsible for the production of the yellow pigment, presumably the c <dig> carotenoid  <dig> ′-diaponeurosporene. in s. aureus, diaponeurosporene is further converted to staphyloxanthin, the orange carotenoid present in most staphylococci strains. for this, s. aureus harbors up to three extra enzymes coded by genes crto, crtp and crtq, which are located in the same operon as crtm and crtn 
 <cit> . the e. mundtii genome encodes a protein with  <dig> and 77% similarity to crtn from s. aureus and l. plantarum, respectively. regarding crtm, the homology is reversed, with the homologue from l. plantarum sharing a similarity higher than the one corresponding to s. aureus . remarkably, this analysis also detected the presence of putative homologues for s. aureus crto , crtp  and crtq . however, genes coding for these proteins are located in a different cluster with respect to crtn and crtm, and also show a different organization  to that found in s. aureus
 <cit> . furthermore, a comparative analysis with other enterococcal species indicated that crtn and crtm homologues were present in e. gallinarum, e. saccharolyticus and e. casseliflavius genomes. noteworthy, putative proteins involved in staphyloxanthin biosynthesis were also detected in e. casseliflavius.

virulence factors and antibiotic resistance
the potential virulence genes encoded by the genome of e. mundtii are of particular interest. an initial comparative analysis between different enterococcal species using the virulence factors data base  <cit>  revealed that e. mundtii has a reduced number of putative virulence determinants . we searched for virulence genes previously analyzed by g. mellonella or mice infection models  <cit>  to validate our results . among collagen adhesins, only the e. faecium widely spread scm gene  <cit>  was detected in the e. mundtii genome, which lacks the most extensively studied ace and acm genes. we also found the ebp pili coding cluster, in conjunction with its cognate transcriptional regulator ebpr  <cit>  along with sortase proteins  <cit> , which are ubiquitous in e. faecalis and e. faecium. furthermore, we identified the rnjb gene, which encodes a putative rnase j <dig> that activates the transcriptional expression of the ebpabc operon  <cit> . noteworthy, expression of the ebp locus is negatively regulated by the fsr system  <cit> , which is also present in e. mundtii . none of the other pili-encoding loci previously reported for e. faecalis  or e. faecium
 <cit>  were detected. a cluster of genes that might be responsible for the synthesis of capsular polysaccharides  was identified. it codes for proteins with homology to that reported in e. faecium
 <cit> . in e. mundtii, we found three of the four phosphoregulatory system proteins conserved in all species of e. faecium . furthermore, two glycosyl transferases and the conserved dehydrogenase and flippase were detected as well as several conserved pts-related proteins linked to the eps cluster in e. faecium  <dig> , <dig> .

moreover, several virulence genes that are related to cell wall synthesis in e. faecalis were found . remarkably, genes responsible for the synthesis of epa  were detected . the core genes showed a similar genetic organization to that observed in e. faecium
 <cit> . in e. mundtii the variable accessory region encode predicted glycosyltransferases and other proteins with potential roles in wta production , and the genetic organization resembles that of e. faecium com <dig>  a microorganism of human intestinal origin . since major growth defects have been detected for mutants in different genes of this locus, rigottier et al.
 <cit>  have proposed that these genes are important for the fitness of the bacterium rather than bona fide virulence factors.

other virulence genes detected correspond to msra and msrb, encoding methionine sulfoxide reductases important for the oxidative stress response, macrophage survival, and persistent infection  <cit> ; and gls genes encoding general stress proteins , important for adaptation to the intestinal environment and in mouse peritonitis models  <cit> . moreover, this analysis detected the presence of a gene with significant homology to bopd, coding for the transcriptional regulator of maltose metabolism, which has been implicated in biofilm formation and bacteremia in mice  <cit> .

regarding resistance to antibiotics, the search for vancomycin resistance genes , tetracycline  gentamicin -aph ), chloramphenicol , lincosamide , erythromycin , methicillin  and penicillin  did not identify genes with significant homology . furthermore, mutations conferring resistance to ampicillin or ciprofloxacin within the genes coding for gyra or pbp <dig>  respectively, were neither identified.

e. mundtiieffect on g. mellonellasurvival
in order to study e. mundtii virulence, crl <dig> strain was used to infect the insect host model galleria mellonella
 <cit> . g. mellonella, is a reliable model host to study the pathogenesis of numerous human pathogens  <cit> . the capacity of a pathogen to kill g. mellonella has a correlation with virulence in mammalian models  <cit> . in fact, the innate immune systems of galleria larvae and mammals share a high degree of homology  <cit> .

in our analysis, the e. faecalis jh2- <dig> strain was used as control  <cit> . this strain was initially isolated from a nosocomial infection, and constitutes a genetic model extensively used in our laboratory  <cit>  and by others  <cit> . the semiquantitative analysis performed  on the predicted proteins of the jh2- <dig> genome revealed  <dig> hits for putative virulence factors). as shown in figure  <dig>  g. mellonella survival was significantly logrank test, p <  <dig>  greater after infection with e. mundtii than with e. faecalis jh2- <dig> strain, at two different enterococcal concentrations. in the control groups infected with sterile saline buffered solution no larvae died in any of the replicates . as consequence, these results confirm that e. mundtii is not as effective as e. faecalis in colonizing and killing g. mellonella larvae.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, a study of the genomic data of e. mundtii crl <dig> is presented for the first time. additionally, a comparative analysis including the full genomic sequence of representative enterococcal species of diverse origins was conducted . e. mundtii crl <dig> contains  <dig> cds in common with other species of enterococcus and only a low number of unique cds, among which we identified a cluster encoding a bacteriocin and other related proteins. a phylogenetic tree for concatenated sequences of enterococcal core proteins was constructed , indicating that e. mundtii is closer to e. faecium. this is in accordance with the soda gene sequence phylogenetic comparison reported by poyart et al.
 <cit> , which showed that these two enterococcal species cluster together. moreover, as shown in figure 2b, the highest ani percentage was found between these microorganisms.

bacterial genome plasticity is influenced by the presence of geis, which may include genes encoding for any number of functions, notably pathogenicity determinants  <cit> . only  <dig> putative geis were identified in strain crl <dig>  and none of them carries genes that might be encoding known virulence determinants. many virulence genes and their functions have been described in enterococci  <cit> . our bioinformatic analysis revealed the lowest number of putative pathogenicity factors for e. mundtii in comparison to other enterococcus strains , including different species from diverse origins . however the analysis of the presence or absence of virulence traits is not decisive to determine the commensal or pathogenic nature of a bacterium and the predictive methods have limitations and are not sufficient to conclude on the pathogenesis of the microorganism. this observation clearly arises from the analysis of table  <dig>  in which the commensal strain e. faecium com <dig> possesses a higher number of putative virulence determinants  than the clinical isolate e. faecium strain do . in this study, the virulence of the e. mundtii crl <dig> strain was evaluated using the g. mellonela model. as shown in the figure  <dig>  e. mundtii crl <dig> resulted non-virulent at low dose whereas the jh2- <dig> strain used as control killed 60% of larvae at 60 h. at high dose similar results were found e. mundtii strain was able to kill only 40% of larvae, whereas the control killed near the 80%. our data indicate that the e mundtii strain crl <dig> as it was predicted by bioinformatic analysis is less virulent than the model e. faecalis jh2- <dig> 

remarkably, neither homologues for the main secreted factors shown to be critical for enterococcal pathogenesis, spre  and gele , were found in e. mundtii nor other relevant genes such as cyl , agg,  and esp . interestingly, a gene annotated as a putative hemolysin was found. this protein contains a domain belonging to the hemolysin iii family , which includes proteins from pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, homo sapiens and drosophila melanogaster. in bacillus cereus, it has been shown to function as a channel-forming cytolysin. in contrast, the cytolytic hemolysins commonly expressed by many enterococcal bacteraemia isolates, are two-component peptide systems  whose expression requires the products of an eigth-gene locus  <cit> . however, this locus is absent in e. mundtii. experimental assays will be needed to define if the type iii-hemolysin has a lytic role in vivo.

some enterococcal species, particularly those thought to be associated with soil and non-human hosts  <cit> , including e. mundtii, contain yellow pigments. pigments in e. mundtii were identified as carotenoids  <cit> . this study has shown the presence of genes involved in the c <dig> carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in this bacterium, which is also present in most of the environmental enterococcal sequenced species. the ubiquitous detection of crtm and crtn genes, involved in the biosynthesis of the yellow  <dig> ’-diaponeurosporene, as well as the documented carotenoid production by these microorganisms  <cit> , suggest that the role of carotenoids in enterococcal environmental fitness must be important. carotenoids function as protectors against photodamage as they are able to quench ros. pigmented enterococci are protected from solar inactivation and can persist for extended periods of time in marine water relative to non-pigmented species  <cit> . therefore, we can speculate that pigmentation in e. mundtii could play a protective role when the microorganism is exposed to the environment.

in this work we also identified those genes encoding the machinery responsible for the production of a bacteriocin previously reported by espeche et al.
 <cit> . this feature constitutes a relevant and unique characteristic of the strain. with respect to its biological activity, mundticin  <dig> was shown to inhibit the growth of listeria monocytogenes and a variety of lactic acid bacteria  <cit> . noteworthy, the use of bacteriocins for the prevention or treatment of mastitis in cows has the potential to reduce the dependence on antibiotics. given the genetic features observed throughout this work, e. mundtii could be used to this end, but this hypothesis needs to be further investigated.
