BACKGROUND
many transmembrane proteins mediate cell-cell interactions and thereby regulate key developmental processes. teneurins are a unique family of type ii transmembrane proteins conserved from drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans to vertebrates, where four paralogues exist called teneurin 1- <dig>  <cit> . this protein class was discovered in a screen for the drosophila homologue of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-c  <cit> . structure and domain architecture are highly conserved across phyla. all proteins of the teneurin family share a large extracellular domain with eight tenascin-type egf-like repeats followed by a region of conserved cysteines and yd repeats  <cit> . recently, several publications suggested that the c-terminal parts of the teneurin proteins contain peptides with similarities to corticotrophin-releasing factor  and might have a function in modulating crf-mediated behavior  <cit> . all vertebrate teneurins have an n-terminal intracellular domain with two polyproline motifs, ef-hand-like metal ion binding sites and several putative phosphorylation sites. this intracellular domain was shown to be cleaved from the membrane and translocates into the nucleus where it can interact with transcription factors and alter gene expression  <cit> .

in c. elegans, rnai knockdown and deletion of its single teneurin gene  results in a broad range of phenotypes, including defects in axon guidance and neuronal pathfinding, as well as gonadal disintegration and protrusion of the vulva  <cit> . drosophila harbors two teneurin genes, ten-a  <cit>  and ten-m/odz  <cit> . mutations in either of these genes result in embryonic lethality and ten-a mutants enhance the segmentation phenotype of weak alleles of ten-m/odz  <cit> . it was also shown that teneurin expression is required for the proliferation and cellular identity in the drosophila eye  <cit> . extensive localization studies in mouse  <cit>  and chicken  <cit>  embryos, as well as in rat  <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit>  revealed that the different members of the teneurin protein family are expressed with overlapping patterns by distinct subpopulations of neurons. experiments in vitro and in vivo showed that the different members of the teneurin family form disulfide-linked dimers  <cit>  and promote homophilic cell-cell adhesions and neurite outgrowth  <cit> . these functions of the protein are believed to mediate correct pathfinding and area recognition of neurons. this was shown in the teneurin- <dig> knockdown mouse, which exhibits dramatic changes in the mapping of ipsilateral retinal inputs causing mismatches in binocular mapping. this is associated with major deficits in the performance of visually mediated behavioral tasks  <cit> .

recent findings suggest an important role for the teneurin protein family in establishing cortical arealization and patterning in the developing embryo. teneurin- <dig> was found to be expressed in developing limbs, somites and craniofacial mesenchyme in a pattern strikingly similar to that of fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  and fgf <dig> coated beads implanted into chicken limb buds induced ectopic teneurin- <dig> expression in situ  <cit> . furthermore, teneurin- <dig> transcripts are down regulated, and the expression patterns of teneurins are shifted in the cortices of mice deficient in emx <dig>  <cit> . these findings link the regulation of teneurin expression to fgf <dig> and emx <dig>  two proteins that are part of a complex network of growth and transcription factors regulating arealization of the developing brain, a crucial event regulating sensory perception, the control of our movements and behavior . the best studied protein in this network is emx <dig>  emx <dig> is the vertebrate homologue of the drosophila empty spiracles  protein, which is involved in the development of the fly head  <cit> . this protein is a homeobox-containing transcription factor implicated in mouse cerebral cortex development  <cit> . it is expressed in a graded manner from rostral  to caudal   <cit> . knock-out and overexpression studies of emx <dig> showed the function of this transcription factor in establishing the correct size and positioning of cortical areas . comparing expression analyses of different embryonic stages to the adult for both emx <dig>  <cit>  and teneurins  <cit>  showed that areas of emx <dig> expression  strongly correlate with areas of teneurin expression, suggesting a possible role of teneurins in mediating arealization.

the human teneurin- <dig> gene resides on the Ã— chromosome at position xq <dig>  a locus with low gene density . beside severe mental retardation, patients suffering from a syndrome mapped to this locus also suffer from motor sensory neuropathy, deafness and severely impaired vision  <cit> . given the predominant expression in the developing brain and its function in establishing proper connectivity in the brain, teneurin- <dig> is a potential target gene for causing xlmr.

in order to provide the basis for an investigation of possible deletions and mutations in teneurin- <dig> of xlmr patients, we decided to delineate the gene locus and determined the transcription start site of human teneurin- <dig>  we identified a novel promoter upstream of the published transcription start, which is conserved in chicken and mice. we show that emx <dig> directly binds to and regulates human teneurin- <dig> expression at this alternate promoter.

RESULTS
identification of alternate transcription start sites of the teneurin- <dig> gene
whereas the expression and localization of the different members of the teneurin protein family are well characterized, promoter regions regulating teneurin gene expression in vertebrates have not yet been studied. to find the transcription start point of human, mouse and chicken teneurin- <dig> , we performed 5'-race on brain cdnas of the respective species. we used gene-specific primers derived from the first coding exon and in each case identified two classes of products . the first class ended with the 5'utr of the published first exon containing the translation start site , and the second class included additional non-coding exons. two additional exons were found in human, three in mouse, and one in chicken teneurin- <dig>  all of these exons were between  <dig> kb and over  <dig> kb distant from the first coding exon. cpg islands were found surrounding the newly identified alternate first exon suggesting promoter activity in this region. using  <dig> kb of sequence surrounding the newly identified first exon of human teneurin- <dig> to blast the mouse genome revealed that this entire region was conserved between species with an overall sequence identity of 58%, and included local sequence identities of over 90%. based on these findings, we considered that teneurin- <dig> expression is regulated by two different promoters that are used to differentially regulate teneurin- <dig> expression.

emx <dig> transactivates teneurin- <dig> promoter reporter constructs in cell culture
to test whether human teneurin- <dig> is a direct target gene of emx <dig>  we set up a reporter gene assay. we obtained a myc-flag-tagged emx <dig> expression plasmid to transfect nih3t <dig> cells. recombinant emx <dig> could be detected in cell extracts as a 37kd protein band on western blots with a flag antibody  and the protein accumulated in the nuclei of the cells as shown by immunostaining . in order to do promoter reporter assays, we cloned a  <dig> kb fragment of highly conserved genomic sequence around the published transcription start site, as well as around the newly determined upstream transcription start site of human teneurin- <dig> into a pseap2-basic reporter vector. these promoter reporter constructs were co-transfected with the emx <dig> plasmid into hek <dig> cells and reporter gene activity was measured . interestingly, emx <dig> was able to strongly induce reporter gene activity from the newly identified upstream promoter  <dig>  but not from promoter  <dig>  which remained unchanged compared to the empty vector control. previously it was shown that emx <dig> binds to a homeobox binding motif in the wnt- <dig> promoter  <cit> . upon sequence analysis of the promoter  <dig> construct we found one conserved site with a high score for emx <dig> binding, while the promoter  <dig> construct possessed several high scoring binding sites. this indicates that the mere presence of core sequences of homeobox binding elements is not sufficient per se for the induction by emx <dig>  but the context may matter as well. to examine whether the homeobox binding motif in the promoter  <dig> construct contributes to the reporter gene activation upon emx <dig> co-transfection, we mutated this motif and measured secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase  reporter gene activity. indeed, the seap activity dropped significantly to 50% compared to the wild-type construct .

emx <dig> transactivates a teneurin- <dig> promoter construct in chick embryos electroporated in ovo
to further prove the promoter activity of the upstream sequence, as well as its dependence on emx <dig> expression, we carried out an in ovo reporter gene assay in chick embryos. upon co-electroporation of the promoter 2-lacz construct with the emx <dig> expression vector in the chick embryo neural tube, lacz staining was strongly detected in the electroporated area , whereas no staining was visible with the empty lacz vector control  or upon electroporation with the promoter 2-lacz construct alone . a gfp-expressing construct was always co-electroporated as well and used as a control for the efficiency of electroporation .

to confirm the influence of the putative emx <dig> binding motif on reporter gene activation in vivo, we co-electroporated the mutant promoter 2-lacz construct with emx <dig> and compared the staining with that of embryos co-electroporated with the wild-type promoter 2-lacz construct and emx <dig>  similar to the cell culture based reporter gene assay , reporter gene activity was also strongly reduced in vivo. indeed, the vast majority of the embryos co-electroporated with emx <dig> and the mutated promoter 2-lacz construct showed a much fainter lacz staining than those co-electroporated with emx <dig> and the wild type promoter 2-lacz construct . these findings show that emx <dig> is able to induce reporter gene activity at the alternate teneurin- <dig> promoter and that this activation is greatly dependent on an intact homeobox binding motif.

emx <dig> binds a homeobox core element in the alternate teneurin- <dig> promoter
to prove that the activation of the construct is due to the direct binding of emx <dig> to the homeobox binding motif in the novel upstream promoter, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay . nuclear extracts of hek <dig> cells transfected with the emx <dig> construct showed a shift of the labeled probe containing the putative homeobox binding site of the upstream promoter, whereas no shift was observed in nuclear extracts of untransfected hek <dig> cells or with a mutated labeled probe . to show the specificity of the binding, the effect of wild-type or mutated unlabeled oligo-nucleotide on the protein/dna interaction was analyzed. whereas no shift of the oligo-probe was visible when competing with the unlabeled wildtype oligo-nucleotide, the shift was still detected in the presence of excess mutant unlabeled oligo-nucleotide . the complex was super-shifted with a c-myc antibody against the tagged emx <dig>  and indeed the shifted band disappeared . this indicates a direct binding of emx <dig> to the probe, but due to a high unspecific background the super-shifted band could not be resolved.

to reduce the unspecific background obtained with the nuclear extract, we tested emx <dig> produced by in vitro transcription and translation in the gel shift assay. whereas no shift of the labeled probe was detected with mock extracts, the same shifted band as with the nuclear extract could be detected with in vitro transcribed and translated emx <dig> , while unspecific background was greatly reduced. the binding of the protein to the probe was successfully competed with an excess of unlabeled wildtype oligo-nucleotides , whereas no competition was detected for unlabeled mutated oligo-nucleotides . adding c-myc antibody to the binding reaction resulted in a super-shifted band , indicating a direct binding of emx <dig> to the homeobox motif in the alternate teneurin- <dig> promoter.

to test whether an interaction between emx <dig> and the binding site in the teneurin- <dig> promoter can also occur in vivo without overexpression of the emx <dig> protein, we tested nuclear extracts of brains from e <dig>  embryos known to express high emx <dig> levels in the emsa assay . we were able to detect a shift of the band with the embryo extract, which runs lower than the complex of the overexpressed tagged protein in the control . we were able to compete the binding to the probe with wildtype unlabeled oligo-nucleotides, whereas no competition was detected using the unlabeled mutated oligo-nucleotide . as a final proof of direct binding of emx <dig> to the endogenous teneurin- <dig> promoter at the homeobox binding site in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  in chicken embryos electroporated with the flag-myc-tagged emx <dig> construct. electroporations were performed in developing telencephalic regions in order to test the ability of flag-myc-tagged emx <dig> to bind the target region in its physiological cell context. indeed, we detected specific enrichment of the target region containing the homeobox binding site after chip with the anti-flag antibody, recognizing the electroporated tagged emx <dig> protein compared to a negative control region, which was not the case in control embryos .

teneurin- <dig> expression pattern correlates with that of emx <dig> in e <dig>  embryos
to test whether the endogenous teneurin- <dig> expression pattern overlaps with sites of emx <dig> expression in the developing brain, we performed in situ hybridizations with a probe for emx <dig>  a probe for total teneurin- <dig> and an additional probe specific for the alternate transcript of teneurin- <dig> on adjacent sagittal brain sections . the staining for teneurin- <dig> transcripts showed expression at sites that are in accordance with those reported before for e <dig>  embryos  <cit> . interestingly, staining with a probe specific for the alternate transcript revealed the same staining pattern as the probe for total teneurin- <dig>  indicating that the long transcripts are indeed expressed at these stages of embryogenesis. we detected a correlation between the teneurin- <dig> signals and the emx <dig> signal in a caudal high to rostral low gradient. we find teneurin- <dig> being expressed in the marginal, but not in the ventricular zone of the cortex. especially good correlations were found in the caudal cortex, olfactory bulb  and hippocampus  .

emx <dig> specifically induces the transcription of the alternate transcript
to test whether emx <dig> is able to induce the endogenous teneurin- <dig> gene from the alternate promoter, we set up a real-time q-pcr assay. we compared the mrna expression level for total teneurin- <dig>  as well as for the presence of the exons specific for the alternate transcript in parental hek293-ecr cells with hek293-ecr cells stably expressing myc-flag-tagged emx <dig> . indeed, the emx <dig> expressing cells showed significantly  elevated transcript levels of total teneurin- <dig>  although we generally observed a low expression level for the alternate transcript in our cells, it showed a much higher fold induction upon emx <dig> expression than the total mrna. this is further support for our reporter gene studies on the level of the endogenous gene and represents an independent confirmation that emx <dig> specifically acts on the alternate promoter of teneurin- <dig> 

discussion
in this work, we characterized the teneurin- <dig> gene locus and found novel upstream exons which are conserved between species. these new exons expand the size of the odz <dig> locus to more than  <dig> kb, harboring one intron which is more than  <dig> kb in size. genes with large introns have been reported before  <cit> . a continuous transcription of the entire gene, given a polymerization rate of  <dig> nucleotides per minute by rna polymerase ii, would take  <dig>  h  <cit> . this might add another level of regulation of the defined expression in time and space. here we show that there are at least two promoters regulating teneurin- <dig> expression with one alternate promoter upstream of the published transcription start. only this alternate promoter was inducible by emx <dig> in reporter gene assays and cells stably overexpressing emx <dig> exhibited an increase of the resulting alternate transcript. a single homeobox binding site seems to be critical for the promoter activity and is bound directly by emx <dig>  as shown by gel shift assay and chip in chicken embryos. although one has to take into account that the teneurin- <dig> expression, especially in later developmental stages, opposes the expression pattern of emx <dig>  a direct regulation of teneurin- <dig> expression by emx <dig> is likely to occur at earlier stages. first, we and others  <cit>  showed that total teneurin- <dig> expression, as well as the expression of the alternate transcript, correlates well with emx <dig> expression at e <dig> . secondly, the expression of teneurin- <dig> is highly dynamic and its patterned expression and the overall expression level collapses in emx2-deficient mice  <cit> . notably, we found teneurin- <dig> being expressed in the marginal, but not in the ventricular zone of the cortex. this suggests a possible function of emx <dig> in post-mitotic neurons via the control of teneurin- <dig>  based on these findings, it is conceivable that the promoter at the published transcription start is responsible for the basal expression of teneurin- <dig>  whereas the novel promoter is responsible for the graded expression dependent on emx <dig>  this finding suggests that this promoter region of the teneurin- <dig> gene is essential in establishing correct patterning of teneurin- <dig> expression. although the transcription factors involved in correct patterning and arealization are well known, and their expression patterns are well characterized, very little is known about the downstream mechanisms contributing in establishing proper arealization and pathfinding . a number of reports describe screens to find genes which are differentially expressed within the cortex  <cit>  or which are potential target genes of differentially expressed transcription factors  <cit> . interestingly, in both types of approaches members of the teneurin protein family were revealed as differentially expressed genes, supporting the evidence for a role of teneurin in arealization. lists of potential target genes of the transcription factors involved in arealization, like emx <dig> or pax <dig>  have also been described in knock-out gene expression studies  <cit> , but indirect effects on transcription cannot be ruled out and interesting targets need to be validated. in this study, we validated teneurin- <dig> as the first direct target gene of emx <dig> in human. as a transmembrane protein, teneurin- <dig> is well-suited to convey nuclear signals to the level of cell-cell interactions. however, the molecular mechanisms of how teneurins mediate their proposed function in brain development and patterning of the cortex remain to be elucidated.

many cases of xlmr have been mapped to xq <dig>  the locus of the teneurin- <dig> gene  <cit> . interestingly, many of these individuals suffer from motor sensory neuropathy  <cit> , and teneurin- <dig> is predominantly expressed in patterns that relate to anterior sensorimotor areas  <cit> . taking into account the regulation of teneurin- <dig> by emx <dig> at the novel promoter, setting up proper arealization of the developing cortex, and the well established functions of teneurins in correct pathfinding and neurite growth, we consider teneurin- <dig> as a potential target gene for xlmr. when analyzing patient samples, attention should be given to the newly established promoter region, as mutations or deletions in this area could lead to a shift in expression of teneurin- <dig> early in the developing brain leading to improper connectivity and consequently to xlmr.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we show that teneurin- <dig> expression is regulated by emx <dig> at a novel and conserved upstream promoter. we present teneurin- <dig> as the first direct target gene in humans and characterize the binding site in the newly identified promoter region.
