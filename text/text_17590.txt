BACKGROUND
the gerbil spiral modiolar artery  originates via the anterior inferior cerebellar artery from the basilar artery and provides the blood supply to the cochlea. it has an outer diameter of ~ <dig> μm and follows the eighth cranial nerve from the brain stem to the modiolus of the cochlea  <cit> . the sma is an end-artery that feeds the capillary networks of the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis, which maintains the endocochlear potential essential for hearing  <cit> . this energy-intensive mechanism renders the cochlea vulnerable to ischemia, which is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of hearing loss and tinnitus. consequently, the mechanisms that regulate the diameter of the sma and thereby cochlear blood flow are of great interest.

vascular tone is determined by the contractility of the smooth muscle cell, which is regulated by membrane-potential and ca2+-dependent as well as independent mechanisms  <cit> . an important regulator of smooth muscle contractility is the ryanodine receptor  mediated "ca2+ spark". ca2+ sparks are the physical manifestation of coordinated openings of clustered ryrs causing a highly localized and transient increase in the ca2+ concentration in the subsarcolemmal space  <cit> . ca2+ sparks have been demonstrated in all muscle cells - cardiac, skeletal as well as smooth muscle cells. in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, tight coupling between sarcolemmal voltage-dependent ca2+ channels  in the t-tubules and ryrs in the terminal cisternae generates a depolarization-induced ca2+-induced-ca2+-release  process that causes contraction  <cit> . on the other hand, in smooth muscle cells, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells, ryrs, large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated k+  channels and vdccs have been shown to form a functional triad that maintains or mediates vasodilation by limiting ca2+ influx via vdccs  <cit> . increases in the ca2+ concentration in the subsarcolemmal space caused by ca2+ sparks, which engulf the cytosolic face of bk channels, cause activation of these channels and hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, closure of vdccs and vasodilation via a decrease in the cytosolic ca2+ concentration in the vicinity of the contractile myofilaments. thus, ca2+ sparks form a negative feedback mechanism that regulates vascular tone and hence blood flow. this mechanism has not yet been identified in the regulation of cochlear blood flow. previous studies from our lab have indicated the presence of a ryanodine-sensitive ca2+ sensing receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells that regulates the contractility of the gerbil sma  <cit> . a role for ryr-mediated ca2+ release in hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells, mediated by activation of bk channels, has been previously suggested in guinea-pig sma  <cit> .

the goal of the present study was to detail the presence and properties of ca2+ sparks in smooth muscle cells of the intact gerbil spiral modiolar artery. to that end, a protocol for the measurement of ca2+ sparks in the gerbil sma was established and software for the analysis of ca2+ sparks was developed. we demonstrate for the first time, a detailed analysis of the kinetics and properties of ca2+ sparks in smooth muscle cells of the intact gerbil sma and their regulation by pharmacological activators and inhibitors of ryrs as well as changes in smooth muscle membrane potential. the data suggest that ca2+ sparks are important for regulating the contractility of the smooth muscles of the sma and thereby vascular tone and cochlear blood flow.

RESULTS
localization of ryanodine receptors
in the first series of experiments, ryanodine receptors were visualized using a green fluorescent derivative of ryanodine. a punctuate staining pattern was expected if ryanodine receptors were limited to or concentrated at distinct spark sites. staining with  <dig> μm bodipy® fl-x ryanodine produced a pattern that was consistent with ryrs being uniformly expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum . specificity of staining was verified by competition with unlabeled ryanodine. nearly no staining was observed with  <dig> μm bodipy® fl-x ryanodine in the presence of  <dig> μm unlabelled ryanodine. no evidence for a concentration of ryanodine receptors to distinct spark sites was obtained. the staining pattern is consistent with the theory of loose coupling between plasmalemmal l-type ca2+ channels and sarcoplasmic ryrs in smooth muscle as against the direct spatial and physical coupling observed in cardiac and skeletal muscle respectively  <cit> .

detection of ca2+ sparks
in a typical recording of ca2+ sparks from a smooth muscle cell of the intact sma loaded with the ca2+ indicator fluo- <dig>  ca2+ sparks occurred spontaneously . representative image frames recorded at  <dig>  ms intervals show a ca2+ spark occurring at  <dig>  ms after the start of recording , that rapidly decayed within a single frame interval of  <dig>  ms . ca2+ sparks occupied a mean spatial width of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . for further analysis of sparks, nine consecutive line-scans, each lasting 5s with a 20s interval between scans, were recorded at selected spark sites. there was no loss of fidelity in the observed ca2+ sparks under control conditions for the duration of the nine line-scans. figure 2b shows a typical 5s line scan recording of a chosen spark site where robust ca2+ sparks occurred with high frequency. custom written software described in methods proved very effective in detecting and analyzing ca2+ sparks and spark kinetics from line scans . spark parameters were averaged over the entire recording period. in this preparation under control conditions, ca2+ sparks occurred with a frequency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz/spark site , with a rise time of  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms and a time to half decay of  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms .

effect of ryanodine and caffeine on ca2+ sparks
ryanodine is a plant alkaloid that specifically binds to ryrs and inhibits them at micromolar concentration, leading to the cessation of ca2+ sparks. a typical line-scan experiment for the application of ryanodine is depicted in figure 3a.  <dig> μm ryanodine caused a significant decrease in ca2+ spark frequency and amplitude by scan  <dig> . in five experiments, there was complete cessation of sparks before the end of the experiment. ca2+ spark frequency in the presence of ryanodine, averaged from  <dig> experiments, was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz/spark site, which is a ~4-fold decrease to that observed without ryanodine . interestingly, ryanodine did not have a significant effect on the rise-time or decay time of sparks. rise time and decay time were  <dig> ±  <dig> ms and  <dig> ±  <dig> ms respectively in the presence of ryanodine  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms and  <dig> ±  <dig> ms respectively in time-matched controls.

caffeine is an activator of ryrs, which at very low concentrations  causes an increase in spark frequency whereas when used in high concentrations  induces a robust ca2+ release that depletes the ca2+ stores  <cit> . consistent with previous reports of the effects of low concentrations of caffeine,  <dig> mm caffeine induced significant reversible increases in ca2+ spark frequency, rise time and time to half-decay in the smooth muscle cells of the sma . spark frequency was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz/spark site in caffeine vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz/spark site in time-matched controls without caffeine . rise time was  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms  in caffeine vs.  <dig> ±  <dig>  ms  in time-matched controls. time to half-decay was  <dig> ±  <dig> ms  in caffeine vs.  <dig> ±  <dig> ms  in time-matched controls. in addition to measured spark attributes, spark morphology was altered significantly . in the presence of caffeine, many sparks exhibited a slower, more rounded rise that lingered at the peak longer than normal sparks, suggesting altered kinetics of ryrs due to activation by caffeine.

effect of membrane potential depolarization on ca2+ sparks
membrane potential depolarization increases intracellular ca2+ which in turn increases ca2+ spark frequency in vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> . intact sma segments were depolarized with a  <dig>  mm  superfusing solution. consistent with observations in other vascular smooth muscle cells, high k+ significantly increased ca2+ spark frequency in smooth muscle cells of the sma that returned to control levels upon re-perfusion with pss . spark frequency in high k+ was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz/spark site , a  <dig>  - fold increase in frequency, with no significant change in spark amplitude, rise time or time to half-decay .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the sma, a coiled artery inside the cochlea, is a branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, which in turn branches off from the basilar artery located on the surface of the brain stem  <cit> . the sma is a small-caliber vessel  and has a single layer of smooth muscle cells that lacks tightly attached connective tissue  <cit> . this architecture makes the sma exquisitely suitable for investigating smooth muscle cell calcium regulation in small vessels  using intact arteries, as opposed to isolated cells, which are devoid of their natural milieu. the major findings of this study using an intact vessel preparation of the sma are as follows:  the sma contains ryanodine receptors  in the smooth muscle cells.  smooth muscle cells of the sma exhibit ca2+ sparks, which are inhibited by ryanodine, an inhibitor of ryr.  elevation of k+ and caffeine increased the frequency of ca2+ sparks. the kinetics  were not affected by k+ but were altered by caffeine. these results suggest that ryr-mediated ca2+ sparks regulate smooth muscle contractility and play a role in the regulation of cochlear blood flow.

ca2+ sparks, along with bk channel and ca2+ channel currents play a prominent role in regulating myogenic tone of extra-cerebral arteries on the surface of the brain  <cit> . ca2+ sparks have been identified in many smooth muscle cells including smooth muscle cells from arteries  <cit> , portal vein  <cit> , urinary bladder  <cit> , airways  <cit>  and retinal arterioles  <cit> . interestingly, ryanodine-dependent ca2+ sparks were detected in smooth muscle cells of cremaster feed arteries but not in cremaster arterioles  <cit> . in this context, the observation of robust ryanodine-sensitive ca2+ sparks in the smooth muscle cells of the intact sma, a small-caliber third order branch of the basilar artery, is an important observation .

the gerbil sma was found to generate well-defined sparks at robust frequencies. ca2+ sparks occurred at individual spark sites with an average frequency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz . this frequency is higher than what has been reported for isolated smooth muscle cells  <cit>  as well as intact cerebral arteries  <cit>  and pressurized mesenteric arteries  <cit> . rise time was ~  <dig> ms, which is roughly similar to the rise time of  <dig> ms reported for rat cerebral vessels  <cit> . time to half decay was ~  <dig> ms, which is slightly faster than the  <dig> ms reported for rat portal vein  <cit>  and much faster than  <dig> -  <dig> ms reported in cerebral vessels  <cit> . in fact, time to half decay of ca2+ sparks in the gerbil sma was more similar to the  <dig> -  <dig> ms reported for rat heart  <cit> . reasons for these differences may be due to species differences, due to individuality among blood vessels and differences in experimental conditions.

ca2+ sparks are regulated by intracellular ca2+  <cit> . in smooth muscle cells, intracellular ca2+ is strictly regulated by membrane potential. membrane depolarization by electrical or chemical means or graded increases in intraluminal pressure increases intracellular ca2+ via ca2+ influx and ca2+ release  <cit> . membrane depolarization induced by elevation of k+ has been previously shown to induce vasoconstriction of the sma, which is sensitive to block of l-type vdccs  <cit> . the observation that elevation of k+ increased ca2+ spark frequency  suggests that ca2+ sparks play a role in the regulation of smooth muscle excitability and contractility.

in summary, the data presented here establish the intact spiral modiolar artery as an excellent model for the study of ryr-mediated ca2+ signaling in smooth muscle cells of small arteries  since it generates high amplitude ca2+ sparks at robust frequencies. the data suggest a role for ca2+ sparks in regulating vascular tone of the sma and cochlear blood flow.
