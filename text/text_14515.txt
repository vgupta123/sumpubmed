BACKGROUND
whole-genome sequencing is a very important method to understand the genotype and phenotype of an organism. in  <dig>  the genome of phage ms <dig>  was the first completely sequenced genome  <cit> . the whole genome sequence of phage φx <dig>  was then reported a year later  <cit> . early genome-sequencing studies mainly focused on small genomes. with the advancement of sequencing technologies, particularly shotgun sequencing method  <cit> , the sequencing of large genomes has become possible. thus far, next- and third-generation sequencing technologies have become available . hence, genome sequencing has shown remarkable development.

however, small genomes, particularly bacteriophage genomes, are occasionally hard to be sequenced. we once encountered a tough work in sequencing a phage genome with a size of approximately 90 kb. in  <dig>  we isolated and characterised a pseudomonas aeruginosa phage named pap <dig>  <cit> . pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  results showed that pap <dig> contains a genome of approximately 90 kb, but  <dig> contigs obtained using the shotgun library sequencing method could not be assembled in an integral genome; the total length of these obtained contigs was approximately  <dig>  kb, which is almost half of 90 kb. we subsequently submitted the pap <dig> genomic dna to another sequencing center, where this dna was subjected to repeated sequencing with the shotgun method. we obtained almost the same result. we further verified this result by obtaining the pap <dig> genome sequence with primer walking  <cit> ; however, we failed again. hence, this work was suspended.

four years later, roche/ <dig> technique  <cit> , a second-generation sequencing method, was established. we re-sequenced the pap <dig> genome by using the roche/ <dig> technique in  <dig>  we easily obtained the complete pap <dig> genome sequence with a size of  <dig>  bp. thus, we aimed to determine why the pap <dig> genome was successfully sequenced using the roche/ <dig> dna sequencer but not using the shotgun sequencing method. based on the differences of the principles of the two sequencing methods, our presumption was that the host bacterium of the shotgun library construction, escherichia coli dh5α, may greatly repel the inserted phage-dna fragments by a particular immune mechanism. in the present study, this hypothesis was confirmed by conducting several experiments, including gene knockout and single-molecule real-time  dna sequencing techniques  ; we also investigated the methylome of phage pap <dig>  we revealed a novel mechanism of bacterial immunity that could repel exogenous dna and maintain their genetic stability via enzyme endo v activity.

phage propagation and purification
we isolated pap <dig> and pap <dig> phages from hospital sewage by using p. aeruginosa pa <dig> and pa <dig>  as host bacteria, respectively, in accordance with standard lambda phage isolation protocol  <cit> . pap <dig> and pap <dig> were propagated and purified in accordance with previously described protocols  <cit>  with slight modifications. in brief, the liquid culture of the host bacteria during the log growth phase was inoculated with phages  and incubated at 37°c with shaking at 200 rpm. the culture showed signs of lysis after 5 h and a few drops of chloroform were added to ensure that all of the host bacteria were lysed. the culture was then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 min; the supernatant  was concentrated and purified via peg <dig>  precipitation, as described previously  <cit> . the pap <dig> particles were concentrated using peg <dig>  and further purified using a cscl gradient ultracentrifuge in accordance with previously reported methods  <cit> .

dna extraction and purification
edta , proteinase k  and sodium dodecyl sulfate  were added to the purified phage stock solution . the mixture was incubated at 56°c for 1 h; an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution  was added and the resulting mixture was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 10 min. an aqueous layer was collected and extracted with chloroform at  <dig>  × g for 10 min. the collected aqueous layer was mixed with  <dig>  volumes of isopropanol and stored overnight at -20°c. afterward, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at  <dig>  × g and 4°c; the precipitated dna was collected and washed with 70% and 100% ethanol, respectively. the pap <dig> dna was suspended in te buffer  and stored at -20°c for subsequent use.

endonuclease digestion assay
the following restriction endonucleases were used to digest the genomic dna of pap <dig> or pap <dig> in 20 μl reaction systems according to the manufacturer’s instructions: paui; vspi; aatii; spei; and ecori . the mixture was incubated at 37°c for 120 min and then used to perform pfge. pfge was conducted in 1% agarose gel with an initial switch time of  <dig>  s and a final switch time of  <dig>  s at 8 v/cm and an angle of 180° with a run time of  <dig>  h. the restriction map was captured and analysed using quantity one software  to estimate the sizes of dna bands on the gel. the commercial endo v, or the products of e. coli gene nfi, was purchased from new england biolabs, ipswich, ma, usa. the pap <dig> or pap <dig> genomic dna was digested by endo v in 20 μl reaction systems according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

sequencing of the pap <dig> genome by using shotgun library method
in  <dig>  the genomic dna of pap <dig> was submitted to chinese national human genome center  in shanghai, china for genome sequencing with the shotgun sequencing method  <cit>  in an abi  <dig> dna sequencer . a shotgun library was constructed using e. coli dh5α as host bacterium. the pap <dig> genomic dna was digested by sau3ai  or treated with ultrasonic waves; the dna fragments with a length ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb were recovered to construct the shotgun library. the recovered dna fragments were ligated into puc <dig> and then electrotransformed into the host bacterium e. coli dh5α. clones were selected randomly from the library and used for sequencing. a total of  <dig>  clones were sequenced and the average sequence coverage reached approximately 15-fold of the pap <dig> genome. the obtained reads were assembled using the phred/phrap/consed software package  <cit> . we obtained  <dig> contigs, but these contigs could not be assembled into an integral genome. to obviate mistakes caused by sequencing, we submitted the pap <dig> genomic dna to cnhgc in beijing, china for repeat sequencing. although the average sequence coverage also reached approximately 15-fold of the pap <dig> genome, the obtained results were almost the same as those of the first sequencing. we also tried primer walking  <cit>  to fill the gaps, but we failed to obtain the whole genome sequence of pap <dig> 

in  <dig>  we knocked out the nfi gene of e. coli dh5α . to validate whether or not the nfi- mutant of e. coli dh5α can be used to construct a shotgun library and sequence the pap <dig> genome, we repeated the sequencing of the pap <dig> genome at genemine biotechnology co., ltd. . the procedures were exactly the same as described previously except the shotgun library clones were constructed with the nfi- mutant of e. coli dh5α as host bacterium. at this time,  <dig>  clones were sequenced and the average sequence coverage reached approximately 10-fold of the pap <dig> genome.

sequencing of the pap <dig> genome by using roche/ <dig> technique
in  <dig>  next-generation sequencing techniques were established. we then submitted the pap <dig> genome to the cnhgc  for sequencing with a roche/ <dig> gs flx titanium system  <cit> . in brief, the purified genomic dna of pap <dig> was fragmented, ligated to adapters and separated into single strands; the dna fragments were bound to beads and amplified by emulsion pcr. a solid-phase pyrophosphate sequencing reaction was performed to reveal the raw sequence data. the roche/ <dig> reads were assembled using a newbler assembler  <cit>  . the pap <dig> genome sequence and its annotation information were available for download at the ncbi genbank  with an accession number of hq <dig> 

construction of the nfi-mutant of e. colidh5α
the nfi- mutant of e. coli dh5α was constructed in accordance with previously described protocols  <cit> . the plasmids used in the procedure are listed in table  <dig>  the primers and other dna sequences used in this procedure are listed in table  <dig>  the primers cm-f  and cm-r  were designed using the dna sequence of pkd <dig> as a template. the pcr product  that contains the chloramphenicol resistance gene  and two flp  recognition target  sites were then obtained by two-step pcr with cm-f and cm-r primers. the pkd <dig> plasmid  and the donor dna were electrotransformed into e. coli dh5α. the bacteria were cultured in lb medium containing 100 mm l-arabinose  at 30°c for 12 h to induce homologous recombination between cat and nfi genes. the chloramphenicol-resistant colony was selected and cultured at 42°c for 6 h to eliminate the pkd <dig> plasmid. the obtained recombination strain was designated as e. coli dh5α cat+:Δnfi. the pcp <dig> plasmid was electrotransformed into e. coli dh5α cat+:Δnfi; the bacteria were cultured at 42°c for 6 h to induce the flp recombination of the frt sites and to eliminate the cat gene and the pcp <dig> plasmid. the final mutant was designated as e. coli dh5α Δnfi.table  <dig>

smrt sequencing of the pap <dig> genome
the pap <dig> genome was subjected to smrt sequencing at the institute of medicinal plant development  by using a pacbio rs dna sequencer   <cit> . smrt sequencing was performed in accordance with previously described protocols  <cit> . in brief, smrtbell template libraries with dna fragments of 2 kb were prepared  <cit> . sequencing was then performed using one smrt cell ; zero-mode waveguide   <cit>  signals were obtained. smrt reads were mapped to the reference sequence of the pap <dig> genome by using the blasr software   <cit>  in accordance with standard mapping protocols. interpulse durations  were determined and processed as previously described  <cit>  for all of the pulses aligned to each position in the pap <dig> genome sequence. the modified bases were identified using smrt analysis server v.  <dig> . <dig> . the generated data sets are available for download at the ncbi gene expression omnibus    <cit>  with the accession number of gse <dig> .

bioinformatics analyses
dnastar  <cit>  was used to analyse the basic characteristics of the pap <dig> genome sequence. the internet tool trnascan-se  <dig>   <cit>  was used to predict trna genes in the dna sequence with a cove score cutoff of  <dig>  dnaman software  was used to analyse the localisation of the  <dig> contigs in the pap <dig> genome and to graphically describe the result. the pandatox database   <cit>  was used to analyse the putative dna motifs that were toxic to bacteria in the pap <dig> genome.

the raw modification calls of the pap <dig> genomic dna, produced using the smrtportal analysis platform v.  <dig> . <dig> , were collated as single modifications.gff file. to predict modified motifs, we screened the modifications.gff file by using publicly available r-scripts software , as well as an online motif finding server   <cit> . pap <dig> orf <dig> was blasted against ncbi non-redundant protein sequences   to search probable correlations between orf <dig> and methyltransferases. protein sequences were subjected to multiple sequence alignments by using clustalw  <cit>  with default parameters and a phylogenetic tree was constructed and displayed using mega <dig>  <cit>  with a neighbor-joining method  <cit> .

RESULTS
shotgun strategy failed to obtain a complete pap <dig> genome sequence
the pfge result showed that the pap <dig> genome is approximately 90 kb in length . however, the sequencing results of the pap <dig> genome by using the shotgun strategy only provided  <dig> contigs with various lengths  and all of these  <dig> contigs could not be assembled in an integral genome. in addition, the overall length of these  <dig> contigs was approximately  <dig>  kb, only almost half of 90 kb. we subjected the pap <dig> genome to re-sequencing in another sequencing company by using the shotgun method. however, we obtained almost the same result, as in the first sequencing. we also performed primer walking  <cit>  to fill the gaps, but we still failed to obtain the whole genome sequence of pap <dig>  although we selected  <dig> clones of the random restriction library of the pap <dig> genome for sequencing, all of the obtained sequences belong to the sequence sets of the  <dig> contigs.figure  <dig>

pap <dig> genome sequence obtained by roche/ <dig> sequencer
using a roche/ <dig> dna sequencer, we easily obtained the  <dig>  bp whole genome sequence of pap <dig>  the pap <dig> genome sequence and its annotations have been submitted to genbank . on the basis of the comparative analysis results of the pap <dig> genome sequence, we established a new genus named pap1-like phages  <cit> . the pap <dig> genome does not contain complicated secondary structures. to determine the relationship between the sequences obtained by the shotgun method and the roche/ <dig> dna sequencer, we mapped the  <dig> contigs to the pap <dig> genome sequence and found that all of the sequences of the  <dig> contigs are identical to the pap <dig> genome sequence; however, gaps with various lengths are present among these contigs . the largest gap was approximately 10 kb, which was very large to be filled by primer walking  <cit> . the total sequence length of the  <dig> contigs was approximately  <dig>  kb, only half of the whole pap <dig> genome sequence .figure  <dig>

single-molecule sequencing revealed modified bases in the pap <dig> genome
the pap <dig> genome could be successfully sequenced with the roche/ <dig> technique but not with the shotgun method. the shotgun method depends on the construction of a dna library; by contrast, the roche/ <dig> technique is a non-library-dependent technique. therefore, we hypothesised that the shotgun method failed possibly because e. coli dh5α, the host bacterium of the shotgun library construction, greatly repelled the inserted dna fragments by endonucleases; the pap <dig> genome may contain modified bases that may be the recognised targets degraded by endonucleases.

as such, we subjected the pap <dig> genome to another sequencing by using a smrt dna sequencing technique  <cit>  in  <dig>  in this procedure, the average sequence coverage of the smrt sequencing reached  <dig> -fold of the pap <dig> genome . we obtained ipd ratios of the  <dig>  bases on both positive and reverse strands of the pap <dig> genomic dna. among the ipd ratios, those of  <dig>  bases  exhibited typical signals of modified bases, including  <dig> of n-6-methyladenines ,  <dig> of n-4-methylcytosines  and  <dig>  other modified bases . figure  <dig> shows the ipd ratios of both dna strands in a section of the pap <dig> genomic dna by smrt sequencing: a, b and c show the three typical instances  of modified bases. figure  <dig> shows an integral epigenetic map of the pap <dig> genome, indicating the positions of m6as, m4cs and unknown modified bases. these results indicated that the pap <dig> genome contains numerous modified bases , accounting for  <dig> % of the total pap <dig> genome sequence.figure  <dig>

methylome analysis of the pap <dig> phage
we selected the top  <dig> modified motifs  from numerous motifs screened from the modifications.gff file and analysed these motifs. we focused on motifs with the number of sites >10; hence, we only acquired three motifs . the consensus sequences of these three motifs are “5′-vagraggh-3′,” “5′-avascmsrgc-3′,” and “5′-smtsgktara-3′,” respectively. for these predicted motifs, only some of the sites found in the genome were detected as methylated; this result indicated that the methylated pattern and the methyltransferase  pap <dig> used may be very complicated.figure  <dig>

in silico analysis results revealed that the pap <dig> orf <dig> is a putative methyltransferase  <cit> . a total of  <dig> putative methyltransferases were found when the pap <dig> orf <dig> was compared with the protein database and the blastp scores were ≥ <dig> . these  <dig> putative methyltransferases shared  <dig> identical amino acids  with the pap <dig> orf <dig> . the phylogenetic tree further showed that the pap <dig> orf <dig> is closely related to the putative methyltransferase encoded by pseudomonas phage jg <dig> and slightly related to methyltransferases encoded by bacteria . however, we were unsure whether or not the pap <dig> orf <dig> is a putative methyltransferase because blastp analysis results also suggested that the pap <dig> orf <dig> is related to phage portal proteins.table  <dig>

digestion of the pap <dig> genomic dna by endo v
some enzymes of the host bacteria  of the shotgun library construction probably target these modified bases because the pap <dig> genomic dna contains numerous modified bases. hence, we doubted enzyme endo v because this enzyme can recognise and degrade modified bases containing dna molecules . to confirm whether or not endo v is responsible for the failure of the shotgun method, we used endo v to digest the genomic dna of pap <dig>  the results showed that the pap <dig> genomic dna formed a smear in the gel when this dna was degraded with endo v whereas the restriction endonuclease ecori cleaved the pap <dig> genomic dna into several independent fragments . by contrast, the pap <dig> genomic dna  <cit> , successfully sequenced using the shotgun method, cannot be degraded by endo v under the same reaction condition ; this result suggested that no endo v cutting site exists in the pap <dig> genome.figure  <dig>

use of the nfi-mutant of e. colidh5α as the host bacterium for shotgun library construction revealed the whole pap <dig> genome sequence
to further validate the role of endo v in the failure of the shotgun sequencing of the pap <dig> genome and verify the aforementioned hypothesis, we knocked out the endo v coding gene  of e. coli dh5α. the nfi gene of e. coli dh5α genome was initially substituted with a donor dna  by using a λ-red recombination system; the cat gene was then eliminated by flp  recombination . the pcr identification results showed that the sizes of the pcr products are correct . these pcr products were sequenced and the results indicated that the nfi gene was completely knocked out. this mutant was designated as e. coli dh5α Δnfi or the nfi- mutant of e. coli dh5α.

we used this mutant to construct the shotgun library of the pap <dig> genomic dna. the obtained shotgun reads were assembled into eight contigs that covered  <dig> % of the pap <dig> genome  when the sequencing coverage reached 10-fold of the pap <dig> genome. the length of the largest gap is < <dig>  kb, which can be easily filled by primer walking  <cit> . hence, the use of e. coli dh5α nfi- mutant as a host bacterium of shotgun library construction can overcome the inability of the shotgun method to complete the pap <dig> genome sequence.figure  <dig>

discussion
in clone-based genome sequencing, some genomic dna fragments cannot be cloned using e. coli; as a result, cloning gaps are retained when sequence reads are analysed. although cloning-independent sequencing methods are available , the cause of the sequencing problem remains unclear. previous findings indicated that some restriction enzymes  <cit>  and toxic small rna are present in a shotgun-unclonable genome region. furthermore, some dna fragments in shotgun-unclonable regions suppress the growth of e. coli
 <cit> . however, the pandatox database reveals that the pap <dig> genome does not have any evident dna motifs that are toxic to bacteria; in this study, a different viewpoint was proposed, in which the endo v-mediated immunity of e. coli is responsible for the failure of the shotgun method to sequence a phage genome that contains modified bases.

this study was initiated when we found that the shotgun library method failed to sequence the genome of the pap <dig> phage with a size of 90 kb in  <dig>  several years later, roche/ <dig> sequencing method was established. we used the roche/ <dig> technique to sequence the pap <dig> genome again in  <dig>  we easily obtained the complete genome sequence  of the pap <dig> genome. as such, we wondered why the pap <dig> genome could be successfully sequenced using roche/ <dig> technique but could not be sequenced using the shotgun method. in contrast to the roche/ <dig> strategy, the shotgun strategy requires shotgun library construction. based on the principle difference of the two sequencing methods, our presumption was that e. coli dh5α, the host bacterium of the shotgun library construction, probably repel the inserted phage-dna fragments via a particular immune mechanism.

the shotgun strategy has been successfully applied to sequence the genomes of many organisms, including bacteria, plants and animals, as well as viruses. the host bacteria of the constructed shotgun library did not repel the inserted dna fragments of these organisms. therefore, the pap <dig> genome, as a hard-to-sequence genome, should exhibit a unique characteristic in its genome composition. considering previous studies, we found that some phage genomes contain modified bases. for instance, deoxycytidines in the genome of enterobacteria phage t <dig> are replaced with 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidines   <cit> ; thymines in the genome of bacillus subtilis phage pbs- <dig> are substituted by uracils   <cit> . thymines in the genomes of b. subtilis phage spo <dig>  <cit>  and delftia acidovorans phage Φw- <dig>  <cit>  are replaced with 5-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridines . the phage genomes with modified bases may be commonly observed. these modified bases in a phage genome perform essential functions  <cit> , such as escaping the exclusion of host immune mechanism. during evolution, bacteria most likely develop an immune mechanism that aims directly at these modified bases in exogenous dna.

several known bacterial immune mechanisms, such as r-m  <cit> , t-a  <cit> , abi  <cit>  and crispr-cas  <cit>  systems exist, but any of these mechanisms does not directly aim at varied modified bases in exogenous dna. we then focused on the enzyme endo v because this enzyme can recognise many kinds of modified bases in dna strands  <cit> . the mechanism of endo v activity is different from that of general restriction endonucleases in an r-m system because these restriction endonucleases of the r-m system generally recognise and cut at unmodified base sites  <cit> ; by contrast, endo v recognises and cuts at modified base sites. endo v also exhibits endonuclease and exonuclease activities  <cit> , which provide endo v with a more effective dna destruction activity than general restriction endonucleases.

endo v was originally reported as a dna repair enzyme  <cit>  encoded by the nfi gene; most bacteria contain the nfi gene in their genome. this enzyme can recognise and cleave various modified bases and abnormal structures, such as deaminated bases, abasic  sites, base mismatches, methylated bases, flap dna, pseudo-y structures and small insertions/deletions  <cit>  in dna molecules, with a cleavage site at the second phosphodiester bond in the 3′ direction from the recognition site; as a result, a nick with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl groups is formed and dna strands are greatly disrupted because of the exonuclease activity of this enzyme. to determine whether or not endo v can destroy the pap <dig> genomic dna, endo v  was used to digest the pap <dig> genomic dna. the result indicated that endo v degraded the pap <dig> genomic dna into a smear band .

to further validate the role of endo v in the failure of the shotgun sequencing of the pap <dig> genome, we knocked out endo v-coding nfi gene and constructed an nfi- mutant of e. coli dh5α. this mutant was then used as the host bacterium to construct the pap <dig> genomic dna shotgun library. consequently, the obtained sequences covered  <dig> % of the pap <dig> genome when the sequencing amount of the pap <dig> genome reached a 10-fold coverage and the largest gap between contigs was < <dig>  kb , which is very easy to close. this result further confirmed that the activity of endo v is responsible for the failure of the shotgun sequencing of the pap <dig> genome.

the smrt dna sequence of the pap <dig> genome showed that  <dig>  bases of this genome were substituted with modified bases, including  <dig> m6a,  <dig> m4c and  <dig>  other modified bases . the positions of each modified base in the pap <dig> genome  indicated the presence of modified bases in this genome. we also investigated the methylome of the pap <dig> phage, which may be the first phage methylome revealed by smrt technology; this methylome may be significant in future studies on phage biology and host interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
this work revealed the whole pap <dig> genome sequence that contains numerous modified bases, provided complete information of the epigenetic information map of the pap <dig> phage with  <dig>  modified bases and investigated the methylome of pap <dig>  we found that the shotgun sequencing method is unsuitable for genomes containing many modified bases. to resolve this problem, we may use the nfi- mutant of e. coli dh5α as the host bacterium of dna library construction. moreover, we revealed a new mechanism of bacterial immunity to repel exogenous dna by endo v activity. considering that bacteriophage is a virus infecting bacteria and modified bases are commonly found in a phage genome, the new mechanism of bacterial immunity we first demonstrated in this study, may be particularly necessary for bacteria to evade dna invasion and retain their genetic stability.
