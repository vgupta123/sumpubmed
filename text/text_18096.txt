BACKGROUND
candida albicans is a ubiquitous commensal in healthy individuals; it is, however, a very important opportunistic pathogen for immunologically weak and immuno-compromised people
 <cit> . recurrent and/or persistent infections by candida species are frequent, particularly in oropharyngeal and vaginal candidiasis, although it has also been described in urinary tract infections
 <cit> . studies describing recurrent infections have focused on determining the relatedness between colonizing and infective strains
 <cit> , as well as between successive infective strains
 <cit> . it seems clear now that the majority of commensal and infecting populations of c. albicans from the same individuals are clonal in origin but subsequently undergo microevolution at the site of colonization and through recurrent episodes of infection
 <cit> . the microevolution of the strains is a frequent process in recurrent infections and it takes place in response to adaptive changes
 <cit> . a recent work which examined the “in vitro” dynamics of c. albicans populations in the presence or absence of fluconazole has shown that mutations that lead to increased drug resistance appear frequently
 <cit> . others authors suggest that natural c. albicans populations comprise a mixture of closely related strain types
 <cit> .

typing methods have been described as useful tools for the differentiation between strains isolated only once and those able to cause recurrent infections. although several typing methods have been described for c. albicans , one of the most suitable is the fragment length analysis of microsatellites called microsatellite length polymorphism . this technique has a high discriminatory power and reproducibility. mlp analysis has proved its efficacy and reproducibility in a large number of epidemiological studies
 <cit> ; however, this technique is not easy to use and the estimated cost per isolate remains high.

the high resolution melting  provides a faster and cheaper method for microsatellite fragment analysis. this technique uses fluorescent dna binding dyes with improved saturation properties allowing a precise assessment of sequence variation based on dna melting curves analysis
 <cit> . the suitability of hrm to discriminate pcr products based on one nucleotide change has also been described. some recent articles, focusing on the capacity of hrm to identify and genotype fungi, have been reported
 <cit> .

in this work, we developed a method based on hrm to assess the relatedness of strains in a clinical case of recurrent candiduria. the results were compared with the conventional mlp genotyping techniques. the isolates, recovered over a period of five years, additionally showed significant differences in their susceptibility to antifungal agents. antifungal susceptibility test and selection of resistant population was performed.

methods
origin of the strains and clinical data from the patient
the strains were isolated from a  <dig> year old male with medullary sponge right kidney  and recurrent reno-urethral lithiasis subjected to several lithotripsies. the patient was admitted in a tertiary general hospital  diagnosed with right pyelonephritis caused by obstructive kidney stones. c. albicans was isolated in blood cultures and urocultures. the antifungal susceptibility profile showed that azoles and amphotericin b were active in vitro against this strain  as shown in table

treatment with ciprofloxacin  <dig> mg/ <dig> h and fluconazole iv  <dig> mg/ <dig> h was started. after three days of treatment, as fever persisted and blood and urine cultures remained positive, fluconazole was replaced by amphotericin b lipid complex  <dig> mg/ <dig> h iv and  <dig> mg every other day. six days after admission, lithotripsy was performed and a double j stent was placed. he was discharged from hospital a month after admission. from  <dig> to  <dig>  the patient suffered from several episodes of candida infection and underwent multiple lithotripsies. he was treated with oral fluconazole  several times. a total of  <dig> strains were isolated from urine and sent to the mycology reference laboratory for identification and susceptibility testing . in  <dig> the susceptibility of one of the isolates  showed high mics for fluconazole . three months later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital and diagnosed with hydronephrosis and kidney obstruction after the placement of a double j stent in the right kidney. the stent was removed and a percutaneous nephrostomy was performed. an initial treatment with caspofungin  <dig> mg iv and then  <dig> mg iv/ <dig> h was established. later, the patient was treated with amphotericin b lipid complex  and was subsequently put back on caspofungin until patient was discharged from the hospital. during the stay in the hospital, blood cultures were negative while urine cultures remained positive until the patient was treated with amphotericin b. the patient’s isolates were controlled in an outpatient mode up to the end of  <dig>  at which time the patient went to another institution and no more samples were taken. the written informed consent was sought and obtained from the patient according to spanish regulations at that date. the patient also signed his consent to the release of his clinical and personal information in a scientific publication.

antifungal susceptibility testing
antifungal susceptibilities were tested in vitro according to the eucast microdilution method . interpretative breakpoints proposed by eucast for fluconazole and voriconazole were used
 <cit> . for the rest of the antifungal tested, the breakpoints proposed by rodriguez-tudela et al. were used
 <cit> . the antifungal agents used were amphotericin b, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. isolates were stored at −20°c until use.

selection of resistant population
in february of  <dig>  the isolates available in our culture collection  were subcultured for genotyping studies. to analyze the probability of the coexistence of fluconazole resistant and susceptible populations in each isolate, we performed a screening assay based on a single-concentration fluconazole test
 <cit> . the antifungal concentration used in this assay was selected on the basis of the mic values previously obtained. the test of growth was performed in microplates containing rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 2% glucose  and a final fluconazole concentration of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l. ten colonies of each isolate were tested. for each colony, a suspension of  <dig> cfu/ml was prepared. plates were inoculated with  <dig>  ml from the cell suspension. a growth control was also included. the optical density  at  <dig> nm was measured after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of incubation. the reduction of the od below 50% compared to control was considered as susceptibility to fluconazole.

genotyping studies
nine representative strains isolated from the patient on different days were selected for performance of genotyping studies . the control population consisted of  <dig> strains from patients geographically and temporally unrelated. nineteen out of  <dig> isolates were from whole blood and the remaining isolate was from pleural fluid . atcc <dig> and atcc <dig> c. albicans reference strains were also included in this study. all isolates were identified by physiological and morphological tests, including microscopic examination and biochemical tests. the identification was confirmed by sequence analysis of the its  region of the rdna

a: control population.

b: strains from the case study included for genotyping studies.

yeast cells were grown for  <dig> hours in sabouraud broth medium at 30°c. genomic dna was extracted using a phenol:chloroform method
 <cit>  followed by purification using chroma spin + te  <dig> columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

genotyping analysis of c. albicans was performed using mlp procedure with three different markers previously described, cdc 3
 <cit> ; ef 3
 <cit>  and his 3
 <cit> . the primers sequences used to amplify these markers were: cdc <dig> forward  and reverse ; ef <dig> forward  and reverse  and his <dig> forward  and reverse .

mlp analysis using capillary electrophoresis was modified from botterel et al. <cit> . alleles were amplified in a multiplex pcr in a  <dig> μl final volume containing  <dig> ng dna, 1x pcr-buffer ii ,  <dig>  mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate,  <dig> mm of mgcl <dig>  and  <dig>  μm of each primer and 1u of amplitaq polymerase .

sense cdc <dig> primer was labelled with  <dig>   <dig>  2′, 4′, 5′, 7′-hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein , ef <dig> antisense primer with 6-carboxyfluorescein  and his  <dig> sense primer was labelled with 2′-chloro-5′-fluoro-7′,8′-fused phenyl- <dig> -dichloro-6-carboxyfluorescein . primers were synthesized by sigma-aldrich .

pcr reactions were performed in a geneamp pcr system  <dig> . the cycling conditions included a first step for preincubation  and denaturation of the dna template at 95°c during  <dig> minutes. next steps consisted in an amplification program of  <dig> cycles as follow: denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 55°c for  <dig> s and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min with a final extension step of  <dig> min at 72°c.

to assess the size of the fragments,  <dig> μl of the pcr products was added to  <dig> μl of formamide hi-di  and  <dig> μl of the internal size standard rox  <dig> . capillary electrophoresis was run using the abi  <dig> xl  sequencer. fragment size for the different alleles was calculated with genemapper version  <dig>  .

in addition, a hrm-based analysis was performed using singleplex pcrs with each pair of primers without any modification of the reaction conditions. control population was selected based on mlp results. strains included as control were: cl  <dig>  cl  <dig>  cl  <dig>  cl  <dig>  cl  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> . seven different genotypes for the three markers were chosen . 

after pcr, hrm analysis was performed in a lightcycler  <dig> system . to obtain the hrm curves,  <dig> μl of lightcycler®  <dig> resolight dye  was added to pcr products and the reactions were incubated at 95°c  <dig> min, followed by a renaturation step of 40°c for  <dig> min. melting curves were generated by ramping from 65° to 95° at  <dig> °c/s,  <dig> acquisitions/°c. hrm curves were plotted using the automated grouping option provided by the software and by manual editing for each microsatellite marker. normalization conditions for each microsatellite marker are shown in table
 <dig> 

for sequencing, amplicons were treated with exosap –it  following the manufacturer’s instructions. sequencing reactions were performed in a geneamp pcr system  <dig> . sequences were analyzed in triplicate.

the numerical index of discriminatory power for each marker and for the multiplex analysis was calculated in both genotyping analysis using the simpson biodiversity index 
 <cit> . the percentage of heterozygosis has been calculated by the ratio number of heterozygous genotypes/ total number of genotypes.

RESULTS
antifungal susceptibility testing
antifungal susceptibility results are shown in table
 <dig>  at first, isolates were susceptible to all antifungal agents tested; however, in august  <dig> an isolate showed an azole-resistant phenotype and subsequently isolates susceptible and resistant to azoles appeared at random. between march  <dig> and june  <dig> all strains tested were azole-resistant but this pattern changed again between july and november  <dig>  the latest azole resistant strain recovered was from march  <dig> 

fluconazole resistance selection
ten colonies of each of the nine isolates genotyped were tested for fluconazole resistance at  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l final concentration. from five out of the  <dig> strains we were able to select resistant and susceptible isolates. on the other hand, from one strain all colonies were resistant and from the remaining three strains all checked colonies were susceptible to fluconazole in a final concentration of  <dig> mg/l. when fluconazole concentration was increased to  <dig> mg/l, the number of resistant colonies was reduced .

genotyping studies
microsatellite length genotyping
microsatellite markers were used to genotype the nine strains recovered from the patient. each pcr product was assigned to an allele
 <cit>  so each strain was characterized by  <dig> alleles that were differently coupled . strains from the patient showed the same microsatellite pattern for the three markers and they were different from the control population . all the isolates recovered from the patient were homozygous for cdc  <dig> and his  <dig> markers while they showed a heterozygous genotype for ef  <dig> .

the d value for ef <dig> was  <dig> , similar to that previously reported
 <cit> , for cdc  <dig> it was  <dig> , and for his  <dig> it was  <dig> . the combination of three markers yielded a discriminatory power of  <dig>  .

microsatellite hrm genotyping
when analysis by hrm was performed, isolates from the patient were grouped together for the three markers analyzed .

the analysis of marker cdc  <dig> showed that all homozygous strains, including those from the patient, were plotted in one group except for the cnm- cl  <dig> strain . due to the unexpected result for cnm-cl <dig>  the pcr product was sequenced  and a  <dig> bp insertion at  <dig> pb from the forward primer was found. heterozygous strains were distributed in four groups according to their fragment length. the heterozygous strains cnm-cl  <dig> and atcc  <dig> were plotted together although one of the alleles were different . when we performed ef  <dig> fragments analysis by hrm, six different groups were plotted one of them contained strains from the patient while the control population was distributed into five groups according to its fragment size or whether they were homozygous or heterozygous .

finally, hrm analysis of the his <dig> marker showed six different groups. strains from the patient were grouped together again. strains in the control population were grouped based on their fragment size pattern .

discrimination power for cdc  <dig> marker was  <dig> , for ef  <dig> it was  <dig>  and for the his  <dig> marker it was  <dig> . the combination of the three markers provided a dp value of  <dig>  .

discussion
typing methods have been described as useful tools for the differentiation between strains isolated only once and those able to cause recurrent infections. several methods have been developed to analyze microevolution and structure of c. albicans species. although mlst  has been chosen as the most discriminatory technique
 <cit> , several articles have recently pointed towards the suitability of mlp
 <cit> . in this study, nine isolates from a case of recurrent urinary infection were genotyped using microsatellites and a new hrm analysis method. antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that strains from the patient were susceptible and resistant in vitro to fluconazole in a random way. microvariation between colonies due to exposure of c. albicans to azole antifungal agents has been widely described
 <cit>  and the need to perform intercolony assays has also been reported
 <cit> . we performed an inter-colony test modified from schoofs et al.
 <cit>  and we were able to prove the coexistence of colonies resistant and susceptible to azoles in a high number of the strains tested. the number of azole-resistant colonies was variable depending on azole concentration.

a genotyping method based on hrm analysis was developed taking into account previous works showing that if the number of genotypes is higher than seven, the curve definition is not the best possible
 <cit> . based on that premise, for each marker we selected seven strains with different genotype, previously analysed by capillary electrophoresis. c. albicans microsatellites  were amplified using lightcycler®  <dig> resolight as intercalating dye. when hrm analysis was performed, the isolates from the patient were plotted together and these results were consistent with those obtained by capillary electrophoresis. there was only one exception for the cdc <dig> marker where one strain  was not grouped, as expected, with the other strains showing the same mlp genotype. the sequence of the fragment showed a  <dig> bp insertion that explained the melting differences. this fact supports previous works in which hrm allowed to identify changes in the sequence length and one nucleotide changes
 <cit> .

although the calculated discrimination power was higher for the analysis using capillary electrophoresis than for hrm analysis  as previously reported
 <cit> . the hrm analysis showed several advantages; it was a very simple and fast technique and results were obtained in  <dig> hours , the interpretation of results was easy and the cost per sample was much lower than mlp genotyping due to this technique does not require sequencing equipment and the primers are not end-labelled. our estimate is that the cost per sample using capillary electrophoresis is more than twice that of using hrm analysis. furthermore, it can be used in a routine laboratory setting as it only requires real time pcr equipment. in this study, although we were not able to demonstrate the mechanism underlying the variability in the susceptibility to azoles in the strains tested, we were able to confirm that resistant and susceptible isolates were genetically closely related with an easy method to analyze microsatellites. the results highlight the need for more in-depth studies to be performed on these kinds of infections for an accurate and appropriate management thereof.

CONCLUSIONS
this method is a useful tool for performing a fast screening to establish relatedness between strains in outbreaks or surveillance studies in cases of recurrent or persistent infections. to our knowledge, this is the first study in which three microsatellite markers were analyzed by hrm by using seven strains with different genotype as control population and reaching hrm resolution limits. although hrm analysis method presented a lower degree of discrimination compared to other genotyping methods, it provided a more cost-effective and suitable alternative for genotyping c. albicans in a clinical laboratory.
