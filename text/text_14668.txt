BACKGROUND
the moss physcomitrella patens  b. s. g. is an important model organism for comparative studies in plant science  <cit> . the ancestors of mosses and seed plants separated shortly after the transition from water to land at least  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the moss physcomitrella is therefore placed in a phylogenetic key position between the green algae and the seed plants. physcomitrella displays an exceptionally high rate of homologous recombination  <cit> , which is a unique characteristic among plants. this facilitates direct replacement of genomic loci to knock-out or knock-in genes in order to enable their fast and straightforward functional characterisation  <cit> . functional mutations are furthermore facilitated by the dominating haploid gametophyte of the moss. besides, physcomitrella is easy to handle in vitro and to transfect, and is regarded as a rich source of novel genes  <cit> . more than  <dig>  sequenced cdna fragments, so called expressed sequence tags , derived from the worldwide labstrain 'gransden' have been assembled and annotated in a non-redundant database, a physcomitrella gene index  <cit> . at present, the physcomitrella patens genome is sequenced by a whole genome shotgun approach at the joint genome institute  and the appendant international moss genome consortium collaborates in processing and assembling the genome data. little is known about the genome organisation yet. the physcomitrella genome is of intermediate size with about  <dig> megabases  <cit>  and cytogenetic analyses indicate a chromosome number of n =  <dig>  <cit> . neither molecular markers nor genetic linkage maps have been established so far. thus our objective was to establish est-derived microsatellites in order to be able to create a genetic map for physcomitrella patens.

microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  denote a dna class of mono- up to hexanucleotide sequence repeats dispersed over the whole genome with an accumulation in nonrepetitive dna and untranslated 3'- and 5'-regions of genes  <cit> . ssrs are currently preferentially applied as molecular markers in numerous organisms particularly with regard to their unique hypervariabilty combined with co-dominance, specificity and reproducibility  <cit> . the main disadvantage of ssrs as markers has been their time consuming development in the laboratory  <cit> . however, with the fast-paced increase of nucleic acid sequences during the last decade it became practicable to screen in silico for microsatellites in sequence databases for a growing number of organisms. several tools have been made available for the computational database mining of ssrs, reviewed in  <cit> . apart from genomic sequences, especially the large number of availble ests and the respective databases have been used extensively to derive ssrs, for example  <cit> . a big advantage of est-derived markers is their non-anonymity. each marker is absolutely linked to a distinct gene and therefore to its known or putative function. moreover, each marker sequence can be extended by the underlying est. this in particular can be of great benefit in the implementation of genetic markers and linkage maps as a scaffold for physical mapping.

a clear-cut comparison of the first large scale est-based ssr search for a moss with results obtained for other plant species was virtually impossible due to the large differences in the applied ssr search strategies concerning the redundancy and the chosen parameters for the minimal ssr motif length or the inclusion/exclusion of imperfect ssrs  <cit> . in wheat, for example, this differences led to reported ssr frequencies ranging from  <dig>  <cit>  up to  <dig>   <cit>  ssr per megabase. furthermore, comparative analyses of ssr frequencies based on large scale computational database searches have been limited to only a few groups of mono- and dicots  <cit> .

in this study we present our results on the development of ssr markers for physcomitrella patens based on clustered est data, their classification and characterisation and their applicability as genetic markers on the intra- as well as on the interspecies level. for a better classification of our results on physcomitrella ssrs, we performed a comparative side by side est-based ssr search in  <dig> phylogenetically well distributed plant species including two green algae, two mosses, a fern, a fern palm, the ginkgo tree, two conifers, ten dicots and five monocots and present our results on the observed ssr frequencies.

RESULTS
within the physcomitrella patens gene index dimer ssrs are most frequent
we analysed  <dig>  virtual physcomitrella transcripts with the misa software  <cit> . in  <dig>   of the est sequences one or more microsatellites were found,  <dig>  microsatellite motifs were detected in total. this corresponds to a frequency of  <dig>  ssr counts per mega base pairs  and one ssr per  <dig>  kilo base pairs . interestingly, the majority of the ssrs were dimer repeats with  <dig>  individual ssrs , whereas only  <dig>   were trinucleotide repeats. this is an unexpected result because trimer repeats are reported to be the most frequent ssrs in plant ests  <cit> . other ssrs were  <dig>  tetranucleotides,  <dig>  pentanucleotides and one hexanucleotide ssr . this corresponds to ssr counts/mbp of  <dig>  for dimers,  <dig>  for trimers,  <dig>  for tetramers,  <dig>  for pentamers and  <dig>  for hexamers, respectively. among each of the ssr classes the different possible repeat motifs were not evenly distributed . the average motif length including compound ssrs was  <dig>  base pairs  with  <dig> % of the motifs being larger than  <dig> bp.

 <dig> est sequences contained more than one ssr.  <dig> ests contained two ssrs ,  <dig> contained three ,  <dig> contained four , six contained five  and one est each contained six, seven respectively  <dig> ssrs . for the generation of pcr markers, multiple ssrs in one est being separated by less than  <dig> bp were defined as in 'compound formation' and subsequently handled as one single potential marker. multiple ssrs being separated by more than  <dig> bp were further treated as separate single marker loci. in total,  <dig>  ssrs were available as potential marker loci, comprising  <dig>  ssrs in single and  <dig> ssrs in compound formation.

a high rate of physcomitrella ssrs are pcr applicable
oligonucleotide primer sequences were successfully derived for  <dig>   of the  <dig>  single and compound microsatellites using the primer <dig>  <cit>  software in batch mode with misa. primers could not be designed for ssr motifs comprising too short or inappropriately composed flanking sequences.

for  <dig> ssrs, primer pairs were synthesized and pcr was performed using the standard physcomitrella lab strain 'gransden'. pcr led to successful product amplifications in  <dig> of  <dig> ssrs , of which  <dig> ssr amplicons  yielded longer sequences than expected , most likely due to presence of introns. the frequency of successfully amplified ssrs was more than  <dig> % higher than described for hordeum vulgare, where ssr markers were also derived with misa/primer <dig>  <cit> . this may be due to the high quality of the clustered physcomitrella est database and our specific pcr conditions with a touchdown pcr and a decreased final primer annealing temperature. moreover, differing intron frequencies with  <dig> % in hordeum  <cit>  and  <dig>  % in physcomitrella, as detected in ssr amplicons, may also contribute to the higher rate of successful pcrs in physcomitrella.

the physcomitrella ssr markers display a high degree of polymorphism
the applicability of the est-derived ssrs as molecular markers could be proven with side by side amplification of the  <dig> ssrs in the lab strain 'gransden' and the french accession 'villersexel-k3', both of which we are using as parental lines in a genetic mapping approach.  <dig> markers  were polymorphic between the two accessions .

the informative properties of the est-derived microsatellites were further evaluated in  <dig> ssr markers selected from the  <dig> markers and a collection of  <dig> worldwide physcomitrella accessions . in total,  <dig> alleles, including  <dig> null alleles , were detected with a maximum of  <dig> alleles and an average of  <dig>  alleles per ssr. only one ssr turned out to be monomorphic in the analysed accessions. the polymorphism information content  based on the  <dig> physcomitrella accessions was calculated for all  <dig> ssr markers. pic values ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig>  with a mean pic value of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this pic is comparably high for est-derived ssrs, which are generally known to be less informative than ssrs derived from genomic sequences  <cit> . an explanation for the high amount of ssr polymorphism, including numerous null alleles, could be a high degree of genetic diversity in the studied accessions.

physcomitrella ssr markers are cross-species applicable
physcomitrella patens belongs to the family funariaceae. to gain insight into the interspecies transferability, the  <dig> physcomitrella ssr marker were analysed in two further species of the funariaceae, physcomitrium sphaericum and funaria hygrometrica . whereas  <dig> ssr pcrs  performed well in the more closely related physcomitrium sphaericum, only  <dig>  did so in the more distantly related funaria hygrometrica . given this data, we estimate that for physcomitrium sphaericum about  <dig>  physcomitrella ssrs with the appendant primer pairs can be transferred directly and still about  <dig>  physcomitrella ssrs are applicable in funaria hygrometrica. hence, researchers working on closely related moss species may benefit from the physcomitrella ssrs.

our results are in accordance with prior reports about interspecies transferability of est-derived ssrs for numerous seed plants including triticum aestivum, hordeum vulgare, festuca arundinacea, oryza sativa, medicago truncatula and picea taeda, where the transferability decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance and transfer success rates differed from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> .

datasets of  <dig> plant species covering a broad phylogenetic spectrum
we aimed to achieve a clear-cut comparison of our results for physcomitrella with those of other plant species. unfortunately, to classify surveys on est-derived ssrs was rather complicated due to large differences in the applied ssr search strategies and by the limited number of analysed species. as a consequence, we identified microsatellites in a comparative side by side search using the misa software upon the gene indices of  <dig> plants species. accounting for the present availability of est sequences, the species selection encompasses as many major clades of the plant kingdom as possible. in total, two green algae, two true mosses, a fern, a fern palm, the ginkgo tree, two conifers, ten dicots and five monocots were analysed . however, for some classes among the plants no appropriate est datasets were available, e. g. liverworts, hornworts and magnoliidae.

the chosen plant sequence datasets consisted of assembled and non redundant est sequences  and of single non redundant ests . while the gene indices were build using the same principal method, there are slight variations in the chosen assembly parameters for each of the four databases they originate from, namely the institute for genomic research   <cit> , plant genome database   <cit> , cosmoss  <cit>  and new york plant genomics consortium   <cit> . methodological variations in generation of the underlying cdna sequences, e. g. 5'-, 3'- or full length cdna enrichment, may have led to additional bias in the datasets. since est databases are available for only a limited number of species yet, and because they may be affected by a certain bias, care has to be taken in relating deviating observations to certain plant classes or biological characteristics.

the sequence databases ranged in size from  <dig> megabases up to over  <dig> megabases of nucleotide information. the overall average est sequence length was  <dig> bp with a standard deviation of  <dig> bp . significantly deviating sequence lengths were detected for aquilegia, arabidopsis and oryza with long average sequence lengths of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp and adiantum, cycas and helianthus with short average sequence lengths of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the long sequence averages indicate a better coverage, whereas the short ones most likely are due to a more fragmentary coverage of the full length cdnas. the dependency of the long average sequence length on coverage of the individual transcript could be confirmed for the arabidopdsis gi which contains more than  <dig>  full length cdna sequences  <cit> . because of the extreme est sequence length variablity in the different datasets, we believe it to be better to compare est-derived ssr frequencies by calculating the ssr counts per megabase  rather than by ssrs per est as has sometimes been done previously  <cit> .

the average gc-content in the  <dig> datasets was  <dig>  % with a standard deviation of  <dig>  %. significantly increased gc-contents were detected for the green algae chlamydomonas and mesostigma with  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, the moss tortula with  <dig>  % as well as the grasses . ginkgo, aquilegia and medicago deviated from the average with significantly reduced gc-contents of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % respectively.

the overall ssr frequency varies up to sevenfold among plants
the misa search statistics for all  <dig> analysed plant species have been made available at cosmoss  <cit> . the overall frequency of ssrs varied  <dig>  fold among the  <dig> gene indices . the average ssr frequency was  <dig>  counts/mbp with a standard deviation of +/-  <dig>  counts/mbp. the green alga mesostigma, the fern palm cycas, both conifers  as well as the monocot allium cepa were significantly deviating from the average with an extremely reduced ssr frequency of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  counts/mbp, respectively. the monocot oryza, however, as well as the dicots aquilegia and mesembryanthemum revealed a significantly increased frequency with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> counts/mbp, respectively. the high ssr frequency of rice has been reported in earlier results  <cit> . the hitherto unnoted significantly biased frequencies of the further seven species indicate a much higher variability of est-derived ssr frequencies among plants than previously reported. our data for cycas, ginkgo, picea and pinus seem to indicate that a low ssr frequency is an intrinsic characteristic for gymnosperm gene indices. among the monocots we ascertained the highest variability in the ssr frequencies with allium  and oryza .

pearson's correlation coefficients  of the ssr frequencies with the average gc-content of the analysed species were not significant with - <dig>  for dimer ssrs,  <dig>  for trimer,  <dig>  for other ssrs and  <dig>  for the total ssrs. thus correlations of ssr frequencies with the average gc-content of the analysed species could not be concluded based on our data.

trimer and dimer ssrs are most frequent except for the alga mesostigma
in all datasets, more than  <dig> % of the detected ssrs were dimer and trimer repeats with the exception of the green alga mesostigma where they accounted for only  <dig> % of the total ssrs. among tetra-, penta- and hexamers, the tetramers are the most abundant in  <dig> of  <dig> plants, whereas in the remaining four plant species hexamer ssrs are most abundant .

the ratio of the two most common ssr classes, the dimer and trimer repeats, varied among the datasets. in  <dig> plants trimer ssrs were more frequent than dimer ssrs. interestingly, the higher dimer than trimer ssr frequency of physcomitrella was also true for eight more species among the analysed sample. this dominance of dimer ssrs in nine of  <dig> plants contradicts the general assumption that trimer ssrs are most frequent in plant ests  <cit> .

the average frequency of trimer ssrs is  <dig>  counts/mbp in the  <dig> datasets with a standard deviation of +/-  <dig>  counts/mbp. mesostigma, ginkgo, and pinus deviate significantly with only  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  counts/mbp, respectively. aquilegia and oryza deviate significantly with  <dig>  and  <dig>  counts/mbp. the extreme dominance of trimer ssrs is the main contribution to the observed overall ssr increase in aquilegia and even more evidently in oryza.

the average frequency of dimer ssrs is  <dig>  counts/mbp with a standard deviation of +/-  <dig>  counts/mbp. mesostigma, allium and mesembryanthemum deviate significantly from the average with only  <dig> ,  <dig>  and remarkable  <dig>  counts/mbp, respectively. the observed significant overall ssr increase in mesembryanthemum is due to its extremely high dimer ssr frequency. in mesostigma and allium, significantly reduced trimer as well as dimer ssr frequencies were the reason for the low overall ssr frequency.

in mesostigma, the observed frequencies were especially remarkable : although it showed the lowest overall ssr frequency of all analysed plants it revealed by far the highest tetramer ssr frequency with  <dig>  counts/mbp  and furthermore the second highest pentamer ssr frequency with  <dig>  counts/mbp . the increased tetramer frequency was mainly due to an increased aatt/ttaa motif frequency  and the increased pentamer frequency due to an increased aaatt/aattt frequency .

dimer ssrs averagely are longer and more variable in length than trimer ssrs
dimer ssrs are much more variable in length throughout the analysed species than trimer ssrs with the exception of mesostigma . the average standard deviation of the dimer ssr length with +/- <dig>  bp is more than two times larger than that of trimer ssrs with only +/-  <dig>  bp. on average, dimer ssrs  were significantly longer  than trimer ssrs . the reduced average dimer length in mesostigma of only  <dig>  bp with a small standard deviation  might be correlated to the corresponding reduced dimer counts/mbp. the average dimer length was longest in the two conifers with  <dig>  bp, respectively  <dig>  bp. further significant deviations from the average ssr length  could neither be correlated with ssr counts/mbp nor with certain taxonomic clades.

the ssr dimer motif ag/ct is exceptionally abundant in mesembryanthemum
the abundancies of the four canonical non-redundant ssr dimer motifs varied strongly among the analysed plants . the average counts/mbp for the ssrs motifs ag/ct, ac/gt, at/ta and cg/gc were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . the large standard deviations reflect the extremely varying motif abundancies in the analysed species. as an amendment to earlier studies, where ag/ct was found to be the most abundant dimer motif in several plants  <cit> , in our analysis this was persistent for only  <dig> of the  <dig> datasets. in chlamydomonas, ac/gt and in mesostigma, ginkgo, picea, pinus, gossypium, solanum and allium at/ta was the most abundant dimer ssr motif. for picea, the high abundance of at/ta repeats has been noted in earlier reports  <cit> . in mesembryanthemum an exceptionally high frequency of the ag/ct motif with  <dig> counts/mbp is the main contribution to the species increased overall ssr frequency.

observed abundancies of ssr trimer motifs amend earlier reports
the abundancies of the ten canonical non-redundant ssr trimer motifs varied as well . the average counts/mbp for the ssrs motifs were  <dig>   for ccg/cgg,  <dig>   for agt/act,  <dig>   for agg/cct,  <dig>   for agc/gct,  <dig>   for act/atg,  <dig>   for acg/cgt,  <dig>   for acc/ggt,  <dig>   for aat/att,  <dig>   for aag/ctt and  <dig>   for aac/gtt. like for the dimer motifs, the large standard deviations reflect the extremely varying trimer motif abundancies in the analysed species. in the four grasses, ccg/cgg was the most abundant trimer motif and the same was due for chlamydomonas. the increased ccg/cgg frequency has been described earlier for grasses and has been related to a high general gc-content  <cit> . in this context the ccg/cgg increase in chlamydomonas, which has the the highest gc-content  of all  <dig> gene indices, was consistent, whereas the low ccg/cgg frequency in the alga mesostigma and the moss tortula, which also had significantly increased gc-contents of  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, did not follow the earlier assumed rule.

the detected low ccg/cgg frequency in allium contradicts the earlier reported generalisation that an increased ccg/cgg frequency is specific for monocots  <cit> . an exeptionally high frequency of the ssr motif aag/ctt contributes to the increased overall ssr frequency in aquilegia. the canonical motifs encompassing the three stop codons aat, atg and agt were not exceptionally reduced most likely due to the presence of the untranslated regions in the est databases.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present the first comprehensive overview of est-derived microsatellites in a moss, the model plant physcomitrella patens. we detected  <dig>  ssrs in silico using clustered and assembled est data. all  <dig>  derived primer sets are publicly available, making the markers accessible for pcr analysis.  <dig> % of the ssrs can be successfully applied to pcr. with the est-derived ssr marker set a valuable tool has been made available for numerous further genetic and genomic applications on the intra- as well as on the interspecies level. using the ssr markers a genetic map can be established, the available sequence extensions by the underlying ests will greatly facilitate the implementation of the ssr marker loci during the pending iterative assembly process of the physcomitrella genome sequence data.

in our comparative survey microsatellites were found with highly variable abundancies within the est datasets of  <dig> phylogenetically well distributed plant species. interestingly, species belonging to the same phylogenetic group, such as the two mosses, the dicots as well as the monocots did not reveal consistent class-specific ssr characteristics. rather, species-specificities seem to contribute to the high overall variation. two exceptions to this rule are the low overall ssr frequency of gymnosperm ests, which may be an intrinsic characteristic, and the abundance of the ssr trimer motif cgg/ccg, which seems to be a distinct feature of grasses.

the earlier assumed general dominance of trimer ssrs in ests was true for only  <dig> of the  <dig> analysed plant species. dimer ssrs on average were longer and revealed a much higher variability in length than trimer ssrs. correlations of ssr frequencies with the average gc-content could not be concluded. while the previously reported connection of a high general gc-content to an increased frequency of the trimer ssr motif cgg/ccg was valid for four grasses and chlamydomonas, this was not true for the alga mesostigma and the moss tortula. the earlier assumed general high abundance of the ssr motif ccg/ccg for monocots was not true for allium. our survey is well suited for a classification of future studies on est-derived ssrs.
