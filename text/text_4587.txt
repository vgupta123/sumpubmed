BACKGROUND
advances in genotyping technology led to an explosion of studies to identify genes of interest using classical genetic approaches  <cit> . such studies facilitate the discovery of genetic factors related to disease, drug resistance and environmental response. different approaches evolved rapidly with improvements in sequencing technology. additional advances in molecular biology techniques have greatly increased the speed and throughput of discovery and analysis. for example, microarray-based marker discovery has been applied to model organisms such as yeast  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and non model organisms including the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum  <cit> ; however, this platform can be susceptible to poor hybridization efficiency of low complexity regions and difficulties in reproducibility. such problems are magnified in organisms with high nucleotide bias, particularly the extreme case of p. falciparum -  <dig> %  composition  <cit> , resulting in limitations in genome-wide coverage and cost effectiveness.

alternatively, massively parallel dna sequencing technologies have revolutionized single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery and the study of genome variation of diverse categories  <cit> .  <dig> life sciences' pyrosequencing technology was the first next-generation sequencing  platform to reach the commercial market, offering relatively long reads and solutions to previous bottlenecks such as library preparation, template preparation and sequencing  <cit> . however, the ambiguous length of homopolymer runs, a primary limitation of this pyrosequencing-based method, may prohibit the sequencing of highly biased genomes.

high-resolution genome views provided by new sequencing technologies can be especially informative when applied to progeny clones derived from genetic crosses. homologous recombination plays an essential role in ensuring correct chromosomal segregation during meiosis  <cit>  and increases genetic diversity by reshuffling haplotypes; furthermore it can homogenize alleles through gene conversion  <cit> . in current models, meiotic recombination is initiated by formation of a double-strand break . the break is repaired through a series of steps, involving end resection, synthesis and ligation, using the homologous chromosome as a template  <cit> . repair results in either a crossover , i.e. reciprocal exchange accompanied by a tract subject to gene conversion, or a non-crossover , i.e. a tract subject to conversion but not associated with reciprocal exchange  <cit> .

 <dig> sequencing has been used to discover snps in a variety of organisms including plants  <cit> , rhesus macaque  <cit> , human  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . this and other next-generation platforms redefine the quest for high-density marker discovery and genotyping, presenting an opportunity for obtaining a high resolution view of the genome to comprehensively link various types of allelic variants to phenotypes. for example, the  <dig> technology already has been applied to recombinant inbred lines of rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . longer sequence reads combined with paired end reads will facilitate better mapping to reference genomes.

here, we use the  <dig> genome sequencer flx  platform for whole genome shotgun sequencing  to characterize the genomes of two p. falciparum progeny strains derived from a well-studied genetic cross between a multi-drug resistant and generally drug sensitive parent  <cit> . in addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of  <dig> wgs, we demonstrate the first high-resolution allele discovery method to monitor recombination events and their breakpoints along with other forms of genetic variation that distinguish these sibling parasite clones. we examine outcomes of meiosis that can only be recognized at nucleotide-level resolution, including genotype changes accompanying cos and ncos that can refine our understanding of co distribution or possible alternative double strand break resolution pathways in p. falciparum.

RESULTS
high throughput sequencing is particularly suited for high-resolution marker discovery and linkage mapping  <cit> . we show that wgs sequencing using the  <dig> gs flx sequencing platform is suitable for snp allele detection even in the highly  biased malaria parasite, p. falciparum. by sequencing the  <dig> mb genomes of two haploid progeny clones derived from a genetic cross at more than 30× coverage , we captured high resolution information on crossovers, gene conversion and genetic variation within the progeny genomes 7c <dig> and sc <dig>  relative to their parents.

wgs pyrosequencing and de novo assembly
two picotiter plates for each parasite line were sequenced on a gs flx to generate  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads, comprising  <dig> and  <dig> mb of sequence for 7c <dig> and sc <dig>  respectively . the gs flx produced an average read length of approximately  <dig> bp for each genome.  <dig> kb paired end libraries were generated for each parasite and assisted with de novo assembly . the largest contigs obtained for the two progeny were approximately  <dig> kb. the contigs were assembled into  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds, with an n <dig> scaffold length of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, for 7c <dig> and sco <dig> respectively.

we compared the de novo assembly results from  <dig> gs flx platform with the parental genome assembly information obtained using conventional sanger technology, and 3d <dig> resequencing assembly information using the illumina platform.

given the concern that pyrosequencing may be fallible in a highly  biased genome, we compared de novo assembly parameters for these 454-derived progeny reads with the parental genome sequence derived from standard dideoxy-based sequencing . we demonstrate that the gs flx performed surprisingly well with this technically challenging genome and the increased throughput of this system affords the increased fold coverage needed for downstream applications, including genotyping and allele discovery. this study demonstrates that the higher read depth and genome coverage generated by  <dig> technology substantially improves the quality  and efficiency of high through put marker discovery than can be obtained using microsatellite markers and microarray derived single feature polymorphisms .

we compared the results of the  <dig> assembly data of the progeny genomes to that of the 3d <dig> genome assembly generated by illumina technology  <cit>  to assess the performance differences between the two ngs technologies in a highly  rich genome. while the standard library preparation method in illumina technology did not permit de novo assembly, the improved no-pcr method enabled de novo assembly  <cit> ; this was comparable to the de novo assembly statistics obtained using  <dig> technology, at approximately 36× coverage with considerably fewer contigs than that with the illumina modified no-pcr method. furthermore, we aligned contigs larger than  <dig> kb to the 3d <dig> assembly  to search for segments that may be mis-assembled/missing in the current reference genome. no substantial regions were found to be missing from the current genome assembly. only  <dig> of our contigs remained unaligned , one  <dig> kb contig from each progeny sequence appeared to be contaminating human mitochondrial dna. the remaining  <dig> contigs were <  <dig> kb.

snp detection and allele identification
to establish the platform for calling parental alleles inherited in the progeny clones, we developed a four step procedure:  map parental reads to the reference genome ;  identify snps between parents in these mapped regions;  map progeny reads to the reference genome; and  identify parental alleles in the progeny genomes .

to identify snps between parents, we began by re-analyzing the trace reads of the parental genomes hb <dig> and dd <dig>  <cit> . in step  <dig>  we used strict criteria to call strain-specific snps by aligning the wgs trace reads of the dd <dig> and hb <dig> strains to the reference genome. a total of  <dig>  dd <dig> reads and  <dig>  hb <dig> reads aligned uniquely to the reference genome, covering  <dig>  mb  and  <dig>  mb  of the reference genome, respectively  content of the uniquely mapped regions). the difference in the mapped outcome of the two parental genomes could reflect sequence quality of the dd <dig> wgs data or the high sequence variability present in the dd <dig> genome compared to the reference genome, which in turn restrict the overlapping regions available for comparison between the parental genomes and subsequent selection of candidate positions for allele filtering. occasionally, more than one base call was detected in a minor population of reads. because these genomes are haploid, multiple alleles are not expected. these positions could represent sequencing errors, mapping errors, copy-number associated differences, or mutations arising during in vitro culture and are considered further below. for the purpose of marker selection, we excluded these positions with secondary alleles from further analysis.

3given as the percentage of the 3d <dig> genome coverage

all genomes had comparably similar distribution of the total bases sequenced  in terms of unique positions, however dd <dig> had reads mapping to only 74% of the reference genome reducing the number of positions for screening alleles.

in step  <dig>  we established a set of  <dig>  high quality snp markers by requiring uniquely mapping reads, with no mixed base calls at any snp position, an average quality score of ≥  <dig>  and at least  <dig> reads supporting the base call identity . relaxed mapping criteria will increase the total number of snps detected but with the cost of decreased specificity.

for steps  <dig> and  <dig>  we used the  <dig> gs flx progeny clone sequence data to assess allelic variation and recombination in the context of available parental genome sequences. in step  <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads from 7c <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from sc <dig> were uniquely aligned to the reference genome . these covered  <dig>  mb positions of the reference genome  in 7c <dig> and  <dig>  mb positions  in sc <dig> 

in step  <dig>  each of the progeny strains  was genotyped at the candidate snp loci that distinguished the parents with the added requirement of at least  <dig> reads supporting the base call. although these requirements reduced the sensitivity in detecting snps, especially in low coverage regions, it increased the specificity of true snp detection by lowering the likelihood of including false variants that arise due to sequencing and/or mapping errors. we analyzed only snps and excluded all indels and variants involving more than one nucleotide. in parallel to the work presented here, our lab developed a gene chip to resequence  <dig>  snps cataloged in plasmodb  <cit>  . of the  <dig>  snps identified in this study,  <dig>  were encoded on the gene chip and produced identical base calls in  <dig>   between the two platforms for clone 7c <dig>  while we cannot discern at this point how much each platform contributed to the small disparity, we conclude that our accuracy in snp calls is ≥  <dig> %.

of the total mapped positions, approximately  <dig> mb of the genome in each progeny genome  was used for allele typing. note that the numbers are lower than for each individual parent because only ~ <dig> mb met the stringent coverage and quality thresholds. parental snp identity was used to call the genotype at each allelic position in each progeny. a total of  <dig>  snps were genotyped in 7c <dig>  while  <dig>  were genotyped in sc <dig> .

genome-wide detection of cos and ncos
a sliding window including  <dig> contiguous snps was used to identify recombination breakpoints  . the method was modified to enable genome-wide detection of ncos . the existing linkage map comprises  <dig> rflp and microsatellite markers with approximately  <dig>  kb average spacing. it identified  <dig> cos and single marker defined dcos  for 7c <dig> and  <dig> cos and single marker defined dcos for sc <dig>  <cit> . the current study achieves an even higher marker density in the hb <dig> × dd <dig> genetic cross with a resolution of approximately  <dig> marker every  <dig>  kb, allowing for the detection for previously undetected cos. the current study identified  <dig> and  <dig> co events for 7c <dig> and sc <dig> respectively  and enabled the discovery of previously unknown co events . in both progeny, with a single exception, each chromosome had at least one co, consistent with the expectation of one obligate co per pair of homologous chromosome  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> and  <dig> putative ncos were detected in 7c <dig> and sc <dig>  respectively. three of the ncos detected in this study corroborated single marker microsatellite events proposed by su et al. to be gene conversions  <cit> . most chromosomes carried one or more ncos; however, ncos were not detected on  <dig> chromosomes . the conservative approach employed here to call ncos in our study misses the smaller conversion events which may be an important source of genome variation.

crossover breakpoint resolution depends on the snp allele density as well as their distribution across the breakpoint region and the length of the conversion tract accompanying the co/nco breakpoint . it also depends on the sequence coverage in the region of the tract. the co breakpoints occurred in a median breakpoint window of  <dig>  kb  and  <dig>  kb . simple breakpoints, where one parental allele transitioned smoothly into the other parental allele , and complex co breakpoints, accompanied by a conversion tract with frequent allele changes , were identified . most cos are simple, while a few cos  are associated with complex tracts. mancera et al.  <cit>  describe complex patterns of genotype changes in both cos  as well as ncos . such complex tracts were also observed by qi et al. <cit> , and are consistent with the repair of heteroduplex dna after holliday junction formation and resolution  <cit> .

the maximum co and nco lengths varied . as has been reported for fine structure studies in meiotic recombinant products of saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , p. falciparum exhibits a wide range of cos and ncos lengths. the distance between multiple cos in a chromosome was spaced >  <dig> kb apart, while this distance varied for ncos  . the distance between cos  could reflect interference mechanisms  <cit>  in p. falciparum. co interference which is a consequence of co regulation has been associated with cos, but recent work has revealed that it is not inherent to all cos  <cit> . further, recent work from genome-wide studies of cos and ncos has shown interference not only between cos, but between cos and ncos as well  <cit> , highlighting the importance of comprehensive genome-wide analysis of cos and ncos to address mechanisms of co regulation. mechanisms of co/nco generation, co resolution, interference, and co homeostasis are not well understood in p. falciparum. elucidation of cos and ncos, as well as mechanisms that regulate conversion tract length can reveal the frequency and extent of loss of heterozygosity within short distance linkage disequilibrium  <cit> .

single nucleotide base variants
the ability to distinguish true sequence variants from sequencing errors is a fundamental challenge in the discovery of snp variants and genotyping efforts; thus it is important to understand the types and probabilities of error in base calls  <cit> . characteristic biases occur in sequence errors due to qualities of the queried base and the sequence context  <cit> . technical issues specific to  <dig> technology include: nucleotide calling difficulties within homopolymers; sequencing failure arising from incomplete homopolymer extension; base mis-incorporation by residual nucleotides during the nucleotide flow step; mixed template beads, and overrepresented single templates distributed across different beads  <cit> . the haploid nature of the p. falciparum genome provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into systematic biases that may be introduced by  <dig> technology in an  rich genome. as a predominantly haploid organism, single nucleotide base variants differing in base composition from either of the parental sequence or heterozygous alleles for a given genome position is not expected. two types of variant base calls were detected in the progeny; de novo snps and alternate snp positions .

de novo snps are defined here as bases in the progeny that are different from those of either parent. eighty  and  <dig>  de novo snps were detected for 7c <dig> and sc <dig> respectively in high quality mapped base positions . the number of de novo snps detected is considerably lower than expected sequencing errors  with a phred quality score of  <dig>  <cit> .

most de novo snps in the progeny  occurred at positions that are identical in the parents. eight loci were chosen and sequenced by traditional sanger  methods in dd <dig>  hb <dig>  sc <dig> and 7c <dig> . for six of these, the progeny base was the same as a parent, indicating a  <dig> sequencing error. for the other  <dig> positions, the snps detected as de novo were concordant with a parent sequenced in our laboratory, indicating either differences between the clone used for original wgs and the clone of dd <dig> strain used for resequencing in our lab, a sequencing error in the parental wgs sequence  <cit> , or a sequence alignment error. this implies an error rate of  <dig> / <dig> kb in high quality single allele snps.

local sequence context affects genome sequence coverage as well as base call errors in ngs platforms  <cit> . to investigate the sequence characteristics connected with the de novo base calls, we searched for local sequence context, such as association with homopolymer tracts, because most  <dig> sequencing errors occur in homopolymer tracts  <cit>  of  <dig> or more  <cit> . none of the positions analyzed were located in homopolymer tracts of >  <dig> bps . of all detected de novo base calls only  <dig> positions were found to be in homopolymer tracts of 3- <dig> bps , indicating that these were not necessarily associated with homopolymer tracks; a majority  of the de novo snps detected in the homopolymer tracts were g  or c; suggesting these are unlikely to be sequencing errors arising due to homopolymer bias  <cit> .

the probability of base substitutions occurring due to a sequencing error has been studied extensively  <cit> . substitutions caused by sequencing errors are approximately 1- <dig> errors per  <dig> kb on the  <dig> platform  <cit> . among the de novo snps, the proportion of transversion nucleotide substitutions  was greater than the proportion of transitions  in both progeny genomes. we observed a bias in the base changes ; t > a was the most common type of base conversion in both progeny. c > t, g > a transitions were frequent followed by transitions, a > g; t > c. the lack of snp clustering coupled with the substitution biases may reflect taq polymerase errors, and signal possible consequences of base mis-incorporation  <cit> .

both the parental genomes  and the two progeny genomes exhibited alternate snp positions, i.e. multiple base calls at a single position. of all positions uniquely mapped, the progeny clones sequenced in this study exhibited few positions 7c <dig>  and sc <dig>  with multiple base calls compared to the parental genomes. we observed no specific location bias for the genome-wide distribution of the alternate snp positions in either parents or progeny genomes.

alternate snp positions can be expected in a haploid genome as a consequence of amplification artifact, sequencing errors, mis-mapped reads, or novel mutations occurring during in vitro culture. the primary base call of the alternate snp positions was compared with the parental base calls at the position. the majority of the primary base calls were parental snps , while the majority of the secondary base calls were novel i.e. non parental snps . the novel primary base call position in 7c <dig> was primarily transitions, while it was primarily transversions in sc <dig>  the uniformity of the distribution of alternate snp positions and the type of substitutions observed in 7c <dig> suggested base conversion bias: c > t , g > a transitions were the most frequent followed by transitions, t > a, a > g, and t > c ; and suggest possible consequences of base mis-incorporation due to taq polymerase errors  <cit> . the technology relies on single bead, single template amplification. therefore amplification artifacts are rare, relative to actual sequence differences. some pyrosequencing errors are also reported due to base miscalls arising from of mixed-template beads  <cit> . these alternate snp positions could represent potential new mutations. alternatively, in the case of a multi-clonal heterogenous population, there can be multiple independent high-quality reads with "normal" flowgrams which can give rise to alternate allelic positions. on the other hand, alternate allelic positions can also occur from paralogous sequences or repeats that are not present in the reference  <cit> .

copy number variant detection
comparative genomic hybridization  was used to detect the genome-wide distribution of large  cnv regions in the two progeny clones. five known cnvs that exist between parental strains were detected in the progeny . these well known cnvs were used to investigate the possibility of using wgs read depth to detect cnvs. read depth is consistent with known alleles except for chromosome  <dig>  where smaller insertions and deletions are detected within a larger shared allele. as expected, no differences were found on the shared chromosome  <dig> deletions between the progeny . the shared allele on chromosome  <dig> is also consistent, but may contain smaller insertions/deletions . the chromosome  <dig> amplification was successfully differentiated between the progeny, consistent with the cnv breakpoints predicted by cgh. chromosome  <dig> contains a small amplification in 7c <dig> and a larger amplification in sc <dig>  the 7c126-specific amplification is highly significant with read depth window analysis and all but one neighboring region is significant in sc <dig>  this could be an indication of the differences in the amplification profile between the two progeny or it may be a reflection of a lack of substantial sequence coverage in sc <dig>  we conclude that  <dig> read mapping is accurate and could be used to detect copy number differences in these progeny.

read alignment density was consistent with the known cnv alleles except for chromosome  <dig>  where smaller insertions and deletions are detected within a larger shared allele.

CONCLUSIONS
comparison of sequence data from the  <dig> gs flx platform with genome sequence generated by conventional dideoxy-based sequencing demonstrates that the gs flx data is favorably comparable to standard dideoxy-based sequencing for de novo assembly of an at rich genome because the assembly statistics were similar to those of the parental genomes. the high throughput snp marker detection method using  <dig> technology substantially improved the efficiency of allele discovery and crossover detection compared to traditional markers  used in linkage analysis. by sequencing the  <dig> mb genomes of two haploid progeny clones derived from a genetic cross at more than 30× coverage, this investigation captured high resolution information on cos, ncos and genetic variation within the progeny genomes. our approach for surveying recombination in this predominantly haploid genetic system allow for not only genome wide detection and fine scale analysis of recombination products but also reveal potential details on co interference and double strand break resolution.
