BACKGROUND
the ability of plants to mount rapid responses to changes in nutrient signals is key to their survival. in response to extracellular signals, a cell must regulate the expression of thousands of genes within a short time. for example, plant roots mount a broad transcriptional response within just three minutes of exposure to external nitrate treatment  <cit> . in this process, the signals are transduced by master regulator transcription factors , initiating the expression of their target genes and propagating rapid and broad transcriptional responses to environmental changes  <cit> . however, capturing and modeling the dynamics of such rapid signal-induced responses in gene regulatory networks remains challenging  <cit> .

recently, a dynamic mode of tf regulation named “hit-and-run” was described for the master regulator basic leucine zipper  <dig>  in propagating nitrogen nutrient signals  <cit> . in this “hit-and-run” model, a master tf binds to the promoter of a set of “transient” gene targets  to initiate transcription, and then leaves the promoters , while the transcription of the “transient” targets continues even after the tf dissociation. this “hit-and-run” model of continued transcription resulting from a transient interaction with a master tf was first proposed decades ago  <cit> . this “hit-and-run” model has gained experimental support now in the genomic era, and has been reinvoked to enable rapid activation of a network of genes in response to nutrient signals  <cit> . however, the prior studies measured levels of steady state mrna – and not nascent transcripts– thus, irrevocable evidence supporting the continued de novo transcription of “transient” targets after tf dissociation is still lacking.

here, we used a novel experimental approach to capture nascent transcripts by assaying de novo synthesis of mrnas in response to conditional import of a tf into the nucleus . standard transcriptional assays measure total cellular levels of mrna. in these assays, changes in mrna levels of target genes in response to tf perturbation cannot be quantifiably attributed to de novo rna synthesis at the time of assaying. thus, we developed an approach to track de novo rna synthesis in response to tf nuclear import.fig.  <dig> 
target-tu identifies actively transcribed tf targets. schematic of the target-tu system. a protoplasts  transfected with a 35s::gr::tf construct are sequentially treated with: i) the nitrogen  signal transduced by the tf, ii) cycloheximide  to block translation, allowing rna synthesis of only primary tf targets, iii) dexamethasone  to release the gr-tf fusion from the cytoplasmic heat shock complex , inducing nuclear import. five hours after dex-induction of tf nuclear localization, cells were exposed to iv) 4-thiouracil  so that thio-labeled utp nucleotides are incorporated into newly synthesized rna . b thiol-specific biotinylation and pull-down with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads enable selection of newly synthesized transcripts apart from pre-existing transcripts. c timeline of the sequential treatments described in this study. cell protoplasts were exposed to 4tu nucleobase 5 h after bzip <dig> nuclear activation, to show the continued transcription of “hit-and run” targets



the introduction of a nucleobase analogue, 4-thiouracil , allows affinity-based capture of de novo synthesized rna  <cit> . when cells or organisms are exposed to 4tu, rna synthesized post-introduction will incorporate thio-substituted utp nucleotides into their sequence. this approach represents the state-of-the-art methodology to study transcription dynamics in model organisms , and was recently adapted in arabidopsis to determine transcription rates in response to changes in temperature  <cit> . in our current study, we developed a new application of this approach by combining tf-perturbation with 4tu-labeling, to capture newly synthesized transcripts of dynamic tf target interactions, including ones resulting from transient bzip1-target binding. using this system, we detected the continued generation of new transcripts after transient tf-target binding and dissociation of bzip <dig> from the promoter of its gene targets. these results provide clear and direct evidence of sustained transcription of transient targets beyond tf dissociation and thus support the “hit-and-run” model of transcription.

RESULTS
combining conditional activation of tf with 4tu-labeling to capture de novo transcribed targets
we modified the cell-based tf perturbation assay called target , which can identify primary tf targets from either tf-regulation  or tf-binding  events assayed in the same cell samples  <cit> . herein, we extended the target system to include 4tu-labeling , which enabled us to capture de novo rna synthesis induced by the conditional nuclear import of a tf-of-interest . target and target-tu are comparable with the main modifications applied in target-tu being the introduction of 4-thiouracil . in the target-tu assay, the tf-of-interest is expressed in isolated root cells, but is retained in the cytoplasm due to the interaction between the fused glucocorticoid receptor  tag and the cytoplasmic heat shock protein . treatment with dexamethasone  disrupts the gr-hsp <dig> complex, allowing nuclear import of the tf. this conditional nuclear localization of the tf in the presence of 4tu enables the incorporation of labeled utp into actively transcribed tf-targets . by performing dex-induction of nuclear import following a pretreatment with cycloheximide , we can identify direct targets of a tf in the target system  <cit> , as has also been shown previously in whole plants  <cit> .

one major advantage of 4tu-tagging of mrna is that it covalently labels nascent transcripts only, and therefore it is ideally suited for detecting dynamic changes in transcription of transient tf-target interactions. using affinity capture, nascent 4tu-labeled rna can be distinguished from pre-existing unlabeled rna . conditional induction of tf nuclear import combined with metabolic 4tu-labeling of nascent transcripts, to our knowledge, has not previously been used in any other organisms. importantly, the target-tu approach can be adapted to study any candidate tf, providing a robust means of identifying actively transcribed tf-targets in the context of dynamic gene regulatory networks.

capturing actively transcribed bzip <dig> targets
we applied the target-tu approach to study the mode of action of a master tf basic leucine zipper  <dig> , a central integrator of metabolic signaling by carbon and nitrogen in plants . specifically, to identify actively transcribed direct bzip <dig> targets, following conditional tf nuclear import, we compared 4tu-labeled fractions between bzip <dig> expressing cells  and an empty vector control  using microarrays. this enabled us to identify  <dig> newly synthesized mrnas in the bzip1-transfected cells, compared to the empty vector control . these direct bzip <dig> targets shown in the heatmap in fig. 2a, correspond to  <dig> genes whose transcription is actively induced by bzip <dig>  and  <dig> genes whose transcription is repressed by bzip <dig> at the time of assaying .fig.  <dig> actively transcribed targets of the master tf regulator bzip <dig>  a transcriptomics profile of 4tu-labeled mrna fractions from cells overexpressing bzip <dig>  and empty vector control , 5 h after bzip <dig> activation. a heat map shows the expression profiles of  <dig> genes induced and  <dig> genes repressed by bzip <dig> using 4tu-labeling and selection of actively transcribed genes. heat map shows z-score normalized expression for genes/rows  using mev  <cit> . actively induced and repressed bzip <dig> targets are ranked according to the number of acgt hybrid box  present in the 1 kb promoter regions upstream of the transcription start site . gene ontology  terms over-representation of actively induced and repressed gene sets selected from a singular enrichment analysis using arabidopsis genome  as a reference with an fdr cutoff of 5 % . b identification of the known bzip <dig> acgt binding motif based on cis-elements discovery using meme  <cit>   and known cis-element enrichment using elefinder  <cit>   using 1 kb promoter regions. the frequency of acgt hybrid box identified by elefinder in the 1 kb promoter regions of bzip <dig> targets were plotted to show the proximity of binding sites relative to the canonical transcription start site



these  <dig> genes whose transcription is initiated or repressed by bzip <dig> nuclear import are significantly enriched for gene ontology  terms associated with the known functions of bzip <dig> including, regulation of transcription as well as primary and secondary metabolic processes . in addition, cis-element analysis of the promoter regions of these target genes identified the known bzip1-binding site . the bzip-binding site  was found in  <dig> bzip <dig> targets , possessing up to  <dig> acgt binding boxes in their promoters . this represents a total of  <dig> acgt binding boxes identified in target genes specifically enriched in the proximal regions of the promoters , confirming that bzip <dig> binds most proximal to the transcription start site  <cit> . altogether, these results are consistent with actively transcribed genes captured by 4tu-labeling being direct targets of bzip <dig> 

comparison of de novo transcribed targets from 4tu-labeled rna to targets from total rna
the differentially transcribed targets identified from 4tu-labeled rna fractions were then compared to previously reported bzip <dig> targets identified from total mrna . in the previous study, bzip <dig> was proposed to mediate metabolic signals through a “hit-and-run” model of transcription. based on analysis of direct targets identified by tf-regulation  or tf-binding , para et al.,  <cit>  uncovered three different classes of direct bzip <dig> targets: class i “poised” targets , class ii “stable” targets , and the largest class iii “transient” targets . in our prior target study, regulation of target genes was determined as changes in steady-state mrna at 5 h after bzip <dig> nuclear import  <cit> . in this current study, we started the incorporation of the 4tu-labeled nucleobase 5 h after bzip <dig> nuclear activation, for an additional 20 min . time-course chip-seq studies showed that at this late time-point, bzip <dig> has “run”, and the tf is no longer bound to the promoter region of its class iii transient targets . in our present study, the functional read-out captured by 4tu-labeling enables us to determine if such transient bzip <dig> targets are indeed de novo transcribed at times when the binding analysis shows that bzip <dig> is no longer bound to the promoters.fig.  <dig> active transcription persists 5 h after tf-induced nuclear entry, in both stably- and transiently-bound bzip <dig> targets. a comparison of the overlap between actively transcribed bzip <dig> targets captured from 4tu-labeled fractions , and the previously reported classes of bzip <dig> targets identified from total rna  <cit> . significant overlaps of induced genes  and bzip1-repressed genes  are highlighted in yellow and blue, respectively. intersects were performed using the “genesect” function in virtualplant  <cit> . the significance of the overlaps from bzip <dig> targets captured from 4tu-labeled fractions were verified using a hypergeometric test with class iia , class iiia  and class iiib  targets

overall, we find significant overlaps between de novo transcribed targets captured from 4tu-labeled rna, and known bzip <dig> targets identified from total mrna studies  <cit>  both performed at 5 h after bzip <dig> nuclear transport . further, we observed large and highly significant overlaps between actively transcribed targets identified using target-tu, and previously reported bzip <dig> targets including stably-bound bzip <dig> targets  and transiently-bound bzip <dig> targets  . over 50 % of the bzip <dig> de novo induced targets , were previously identified as bzip <dig> induced primary targets based on steady state mrna  <cit>  . however, the overlap of the current 4tu studies with genes repressed by bzip <dig> based on steady state mrna  <cit> , captured a lower number of repressed bzip <dig> targets, specifically within the class ii “stable” targets. these results indicate that the new target-tu and the original target methods  <cit>  are more robust to capture induced targets, than repressed targets. by contrast, for bzip <dig> repressed targets, down-regulation in mrna level can be caused by reduced transcription rate, but also by active mrna degradation . nevertheless, target-tu captured a large number of repressed bzip <dig> targets  that have been overlooked by our prior bzip <dig> target studies based on steady state mrna  <cit>  . thus, the target-tu approach enabled us to successfully recover a highly significant number of both up- and down-regulated targets  =  <dig> genes ; class iiia  =  <dig> genes ; class iiib  =  <dig> genes , confirming that bzip <dig> is a dual-mode regulator . also consistent with previous findings, class i “poised” bzip <dig> targets, to which bzip <dig> is bound but are not regulated  <cit> , were not identified in the 4tu fractions of actively transcribed bzip <dig> targets. altogether, these results confirm that we successfully captured actively transcribed tf-targets, which are a significant subset of the bzip <dig> target genes identified by steady-state mrna studies.

here, we captured a subset of  <dig> transient targets identified from the original target approach based on steady-state mrna  <cit>  and from our new target-tu study which captures only actively transcribed targets, 5 h after bzip <dig> nuclear import . while this overlap between the target and target-tu experiments is significant, the numbers are low. although both methods target  <cit>  and target-tu  are performed in comparable experimental setups , they likely assay different profiles of mrna targets . indeed, the original target  <cit>  measures the steady state pools of mrna targets accumulated during the 5 h of tf activation. by contrast, target-tu only captures actively transcribed targets after introduction of labeled nucleobases . thus, target-tu is able to distinguish whether a gene is actively transcribed without hinderance of detection above background levels of pre-existing mrna. this may explain the large number of novel bzip <dig> targets detected using target-tu, especially for the targets that are actively repressed by bzip <dig> , and the significant - yet partial - overlaps between target and target-tu . nevertheless, combining both approaches, we captured a subset of  <dig> dynamic bzip <dig> targets with very high significance and therefore validated the “hit-and-run” mode of action for this master tf.

capturing de novo transcription proves that “hit-and-run” transcription persists beyond tf dissociation
the target-tu approach, which identifies transient targets whose transcription is bzip <dig> dependent, shows that such targets are actively transcribed when bzip <dig> is no longer bound. importantly, these transient targets include bzip <dig> targets previously associated with nitrogen signaling . indeed, the transiently-bound bzip <dig> targets include nlp <dig> , which belongs to an important tf family for early response to nitrate signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> . other transient bzip <dig> targets validated by our 4tu study include tha <dig>  and mcca , which encode enzymes involved in the catabolism of amino acids  <cit> . time-series chip-seq assays show that bzip <dig> binds to the promoter of these transient bzip <dig> targets  within  <dig> and 5 min of the tf nuclear entry . we also confirm that chip-seq signals identified in nlp <dig> and mcca promoters at early time-points, coincide with the presence of bzip-binding motifs . however, at late time-points , the bzip <dig> chip-seq signal peaks  are not significantly higher to the dna input control . therefore, while bzip <dig> is bound to the transient targets at 1–5 min, it is no longer bound to the promoters of nlp <dig>  tha <dig> and mcca at  <dig>  60 min or 5 h after bzip <dig> nuclear import . interestingly, active transcription of these transient targets continues after bzip <dig> has “run”, as shown by transcriptomics of 4tu-labeled fractions .

since the results from the chip-seq time course  and de novo transcriptomics  were analyzed from two different studies, we performed a second replication of the chip-seq experiments to confirm the “hit-and-run” model of transcription. this replication of the bzip <dig> chip-seq experiment was performed at the 5 h time-point . first, we compared this new replicate to the previous binding data from para et al.  <cit>  and confirmed that we obtain the same bzip <dig> targets  from the two independent chip-seq experiments . we also confirm that bzip <dig> is no longer bound to the promoter of the transient targets 5 h after its nuclear entry, using two independent experiments . to further support the “hit-and-run” model, we show  <dig> additional examples of transient targets captured in de novo transcribed fractions using the target-tu approach and we juxtaposed their binding and target-tu expression profiles , confirming the active transcription of these dynamic bzip <dig> targets.

thus, our findings provide experimental support for a “hit-and-run” transcription model, which posits that transcription is initiated when the tf “hits” the gene promoter to organize a transcriptional complex, after which transcription by rna polymerase continues after the tf “runs”. in this model, we postulate that master signal transducers like bzip <dig> may act as “catalyst tfs”, possibly by physical recruitment of other tf partners . we also propose that such dynamic mode of action rapidly activates large sets of genes in response to environmental changes.

CONCLUSIONS
here, the novelty of our system is the temporal tf-activation capturing primary targets combined with 4tu-labeling capturing de novo transcriptome. thus, our system enables genome-wide recovery of newly synthesized rnas resulting from dynamic tf target interactions. we provide incontrovertible evidence that transiently-bound targets stay in a transcriptionally active state after bzip <dig> dissociates from their promoters. the functional read-out captured in our study supports the “hit-and-run” model as a mode of action for a “catalyst” tf to effect genome-wide transcriptional regulation  <cit> . we propose that this dynamic mode of tf-action enables rapid transcriptional bursting of target genes to enable acute response to external signals. the short exposure time to 4tu used in the target-tu cell-based system allowed rapid labeling of newly transcribed targets usually overlooked in standard transcriptional studies. our discoveries of when and how tf-target interactions lead to active transcription, which persists beyond tf-dissociation contributes to the broader field of dynamic transcription networks, with significance beyond plants.
