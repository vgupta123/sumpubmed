BACKGROUND
the frequency of malignancies such as breast cancer has been constantly increasing. this pathological tendency has now become the most common form of malignancy among women in almost the whole europe and north america continents. in bitches the incidence of mammary tumour has been found to be at the level of even three times more frequent than in human  <cit> . about 50% of all mammary tumours are malignant  <cit> . the aetiology of breast cancer is very complex and not completely comprehend. genetic, hormonal, dietary, environmental and carcinogenic factors are known as being mediators of tumourigenesis in human and canine  <cit> .

although extensive research on breast cancer has been in the process for over decades, yet still, challenges prevail in early diagnosis and management of cancer patients. furthermore, molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression remain poorly understood  <cit> . this deficit has led to an increased interest in diverse and complex molecular biology of the malignancy. investigators are focused on discovering novel predictive markers in mammary cancer. such bio-markers play the pivotal role in terms of efficiency in patients management. the conventional approach to cancer therapy provide treatment according to actual organ or tissue in which the cancer originates. however, different intracellular signalling pathways are perturbed in various types of cancer. thus, the patients with the same type of cancer often have dissimilar genetic defects in their tumours and respond in a heterogeneous manner to anticancer treatment  <cit> .

that is why the objective of this study had been targeted to assess gene expression profiles of canine mammary carcinoma  diagnosed by pathologists as grade  <dig> , grade  <dig>  or grade  <dig>  and to be compared against their molecular and pathological classifications. the molecular classification reflects biological processes and pathways within the tumour cell, not only the morphological features. it is also helpful in better understanding of cancer biology . our analysis have exposed, that some pathologically distinct tumours may have similar gene expression and vice versa. probably that is why sometimes patients with similar pathological type of cancer have various outcome and respond in a heterogeneous manner to anticancer agents. despite there is a significant correlation between pathological diagnosis and prognosis in canine patients with mammary tumour, there is still a need to improve treatment strategies  <cit> . therefore, the molecular interaction within the tumour should be kept explored. that is why in our opinion pathological and molecular examination could significantly complement one another.

methods
tissue samples
tumour samples of canine mammary cancers were obtained from patients subjected to surgery. the tumours then, were divided into two halves, one of them was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and routinely embedded in paraffin to perform histological examination. the other part was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80°c. four μm samples from paraffin blocks were placed onto glass slides, stained with haematoxylin – eosin  and examined by certified pathologists . the tumour types of specimens had been classified based on the world health organization  histological classification and mammary tumours of the dog and cat classification  <cit> . histological tumour grading was conducted on he-stained sections using a misdorp classification  <cit> . the mammary carcinoma grading was assessed in respect to tubule formation, degree of differentiation and mitotic index. all the tumours examined were classified as grade  <dig>  grade  <dig> and grade  <dig> . unfortunately survival data of these dogs was unavailable.

microarray analysis
the total rna from the samples had been isolated using a total rna kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the isolated rna samples then were dissolved in rnase-free water. the quantity of the isolated rna was measured using nanodrop . the samples with adequate amounts of rna were treated with dnasei to eliminate dna contamination. the samples were subsequently purified with rneasy minielute cleanup kit . during the final stage, the rna samples were analyzed on a bioanalyzer  to measure its quality and integrity. only the samples of excellent quality were taken to the analysis .

the total rna  of each tumour was reverse-transcribed using superscript plus direct cdna labeling system  according to the manufacturer’s protocol for each microarray slide. the control constituted the pooled rna from each tumour . single-strand cdnas were stained with alexa  <dig> and alexa  <dig> . gene expression was assessed using ultragaps slides , spotted with a canine specific collection of  <dig>  non-redundant clones of 3′-untranslated region  cdna fragments  <cit> .

hybridization was performed with the automatic hybridization station hybarray <dig> . two replicates were made .

signal detection, quantification and analysis
the slides were analyzed with the use of microarray scanner scanarray ht and scanexpress software .

for the purposes of unsupervised analysis  and the analysis of significantly regulated genes, background-corrected value of signal in each microarray channel was in use. then, the log <dig> ratio of the sample versus control channels was calculated and the signal was normalized . the average log-ratio of the two dye-swap replicates was used as the signal for each of the patients. prior to the analysis, non-specific filtering was performed, i.e. genes with small level of expression were removed . quality control, including ma analysis, and signal normalization were performed with the use of the bioconductor software.

quantitative rt-pcr
the mrna sequences of the key genes were obtained from ncbi database. primers were designed using the primer <dig> software , confirmed by oligo calculator  and primer-blast . primers’ sequences are listed in table  <dig>  hprt and rps <dig> genes were used as non-regulated reference genes for normalization of target gene expression  <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr was performed using fluorogenic lightcycler fast strand dna syber green  and the light cycler . the results were analyzed with the comparative ct method  <cit> . relative transcript abundance of the gene equals Δct values . relative changes in transcript are expressed as ΔΔct values . the experiment was conducted three times.

primers sequences used in this study and their annealing optimal temperature and time. the mrna sequences of key genes were obtained from ncbi database. primers were designed using primer <dig> software  and checked using oligo calculator  and primer-blast . primers sequences are listed in table  <dig>  hprt and rps <dig> genes were used as non-regulated reference genes for normalization of target gene expression  <cit> .

statistical analysis
the statistical analysis of gene expression was performed using linear methods for microarrays   <cit> . the mentioned method tests the null hypothesis of no differential expression between the groups of samples compared using the moderated t-statistic  <cit> , which has similar interpretation as the ordinary t-test statistic. the expression of genes with the benjamini-hochberg  multiple-testing corrected p-value below  <dig>  were qualified as significantly changed. the groups of samples compared in the analysis of differential expression were identified based on hierarchical clustering  and were visually illustrated in the space of differentially expressed genes by a dendrogram.

the data discussed in this publication had been deposited in ncbi’s gene expression omnibus and is freely accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> 

the gene function was identified using the ncbi database and panther pathway analysis software  <cit> . the pathway analyses were conducted with the assistance of one-way anova with the binominal bonferroni statistic test  where the cut-off value p <  <dig>  had been recognized.

the statistical analysis of quantitative rt-pcr was conducted by use of the prism version  <dig>  software . the one-way anova, and anova + tukey hsd  post-hoc test were applied, respectively. the p-value < <dig>  was regarded as the significant data, whereas p-value < <dig>  and p-value < <dig>  as highly significant.

RESULTS
gene expression in canine mammary carcinomas of various grades of malignancy
hierarchical clustering  was performed on signal from all  <dig> patients and a gene tree dendrogram was generated . based on the similarities between gene expression, three distinct clusters were generated: group  <dig> ; group  <dig>  and group  <dig> . gene expression in these three groups have been compared against each other and the analysis  showed  <dig> differentially expressed genes between group  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> differentially expressed genes between group  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed genes between group  <dig> and  <dig> .

comparison of the gene expression between all of these groups has pointed out n =  <dig> up-regulated genes in the group  <dig> compared with the other groups : atp2c <dig>  siglec <dig>  gpr <dig>  rdh <dig>  herc <dig>  atf <dig>  siglec <dig>  arhgef10l, abhd <dig>  splunc <dig>  hyou <dig>  arhgap <dig>  nr6a <dig>  gcsh, znf <dig>  lsr, nr5a <dig>  plunc, bnipl, rfwd <dig>  myl <dig>  myl6b, gpi, scnm <dig>  xrcc <dig>  mrpl <dig>  the analysis exposed  <dig> down-regulated genes in the group  <dig> compared with the groups  <dig> and 3: timp <dig>  hoxb <dig>  morn <dig>  ribc <dig>  ksr <dig>  hsdl <dig>  arl4c, sptb.

discussion
canine mammary cancer constitute more than 40% of all malignancies in dogs  <cit>  thus this is a serious clinical problem. unfortunately, its molecular biology has not been fully recognized yet. so far, there are only three reports of wide gene expression analysis in canine mammary tumour tissues  <cit> . the most interesting study was conducted by klopfleisch et al.  <cit> . the authors identified a gene expression profile of canine mammary tumours which was associated with an early metastatic spread to the lymph nodes. this “expression profile” can be used as a marker of metastasis prediction. in the opposite reflection, as far as we are aware, there have not been published any results regarding comparison between pathological and molecular diagnosis in canine mammary malignancy.

thus, the objectives of our study were three-fold: 1) to assess gene expression profiles of canine mammary carcinomas of various grade of malignancy, 2) to perform unsupervised hierarchical classification based on their molecular portraits, and 3) to compare their molecular classification with the pathological diagnosis.

the results of our unsupervised analysis allowed the classification of the examined tissues into three groups. the first one  significantly differed from the others and consisted of four grade  <dig> carcinomas and one grade  <dig> carcinoma . the second group  consisted of four grade  <dig> carcinomas. the last one  was very heterogeneous  and consisted of two grade  <dig> carcinomas, two grade  <dig> carcinomas and five grade  <dig> carcinomas. hierarchical clustering presented the view that the gene expression in the tumour groups no.  <dig> and no.  <dig> was relatively similar, whereas gene expression in the tumour group no.  <dig>  differed significantly . our results showed that pathologically different tumours may have similar gene expression and vice versa  what can be particularly observed in tumour group no.  <dig>  these results can explain why sometimes very similar  tumours respond for treatment in a different manner. we also consider these results as partially related with the fact that the tissue sample taken to the pathological examination is not the same that was taken to the microarray analysis. however, neighbour tissue samples were collected for both analyses. moreover, within the four differently diagnosed tumours only one sample was of a mixed nature . thus, in our opinion the risk of probes contamination in the other three cases is unlikely.

for clinicians, the most important seems to be the tumour group no.  <dig>  as these tumours have shown classical pathological features of higher biological aggressiveness. the gene expression of these tumours also differed significantly from the other groups, thus only these data files are being as the discussion in this documentation sheet. from our perspective a few of up-regulated genes seem to be particularly interesting.

among  <dig> up-regulated genes in tumours classified into group no.  <dig>  compared to the other two groups, panther software recognized two of them as responsible for chemotherapy resistance , two associated with myeloid cells infiltration of tumour mass , one related to hypoxia , four genes related to cancer cell motility , one associated with dna-repair , one with p53-signalling  and three transcriptional factors .

as of this matter what we do believe in, is the fact that important up-regulated genes in tumour group no.  <dig> were: siglec <dig> and siglec <dig>  these sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectines are expressed on the myeloid-origin cell surface  <cit> . all of the identified siglec proteins are very similar to cd <dig> protein, which is a marker of myeloid cells. for example, siglec <dig> expression was found in eosinophils and b lymphocytes, whereas expression of siglec <dig> was found mainly in tissue macrophages. expression of these proteins in cancer may be related with increased recruitment of myeloid cells into the tumour mass. the tumour is composed of various cells depending on the tumour type, but myeloid cells form a major component  <cit> . clinical studies have shown a correlation between the number of myeloid cells  and poor prognosis in following cancers: breast, prostate, ovarian, cervical, endometrial, oesophageal, urinary bladder  <cit> . our previous studies had pointed out the significantly higher expression level of myeloid-specific antigens in grade  <dig> canine mammary tumours  <cit> . it indicates that in dogs the number of tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells or expression of myeloid-specific antigens by cancer cells may constitute a new marker of malignancy. based on the previous outcomes it can be suggested that cancer cells may acquire phenotype of myeloid cells which, as the matter of fact, was demonstrated by expression of myeloid cell antigens on their surface  <cit> . one of the explanation why cancer cells may exhibit myeloid cell-specific antigens is that these cells fuse, forming hybrids that adopt phenotypic features of both parental cells  <cit> . the tumour cells that express myeloid antigens may also exhibit other phenotypic characteristics of myeloid cells, such as capabilities of cell rolling, spreading, dissociation, diapedesis, migration and matrix invasion  <cit> .

the most malignant tumours are usually more resistant to anticancer therapy  <cit> . thus, from our perspective two up-regulated genes in the tumour group no.  <dig> may be important: atp2c <dig> and abhd <dig>  in breast cancer atp2c <dig> ensures resistance to paclitaxel  <cit> . a product of the other gene  is responsible for cellular detoxication after drug administration   <cit> . obviously, in cancer cell it can be responsible for the metabolism of anti-cancer drugs , decreasing their activity  <cit> . these results correlate with a clinical picture of canine mammary malignant tumours  <cit> .

interestingly, in the tumour group no.  <dig> we highlighted a significant over-manifestation of genes involved in the β <dig> and β <dig> adrenergic receptors signalling, h <dig> histamine receptor signalling, and acetylcholine m <dig> and m <dig> receptor signalling. the possible important role of neurotransmitters in cancer progression and metastasis had been previously described  <cit> . neurotransmitters are regulators of cell migration in a similar manner as chemokines. unfortunately, only a few reports are available on the neurotransmitter signalling in tumour tissues. our previous study  <cit>  had indicated that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts increased the expression of neurotransmitters in cancer cells. a role of stress hormones in carcinogenesis and tumour progression is commonly known. it has been shown that norepinephrine strongly induced migration of tumour cells  <cit> , whereas epinephrine modulated carcinogenesis in the lungs  <cit> . thus, stress is considered as a major risk factor of cancer development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
molecular classification of canine mammary tumours is not identical with pathological classification. the tumours classified to the group no.  <dig>  constituted a molecularly homogeneous group which differs significantly from the others. the most important up-regulated genes in these tumours were mainly involved in myeloid cell phenotype, neurotransmitters pathways as well as in anti-cancer drug resistance.
