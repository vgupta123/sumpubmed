BACKGROUND
upon encounter with the antigen in secondary lymphoid tissues, naïve cd4+ t cells initiate a vigorous clonal expansion. this expansion leads to the differentiation and specialization into functionally distinct t helper  cell subsets or lineages. each th subset is involved in tailoring immune responses specific to a wide range of antigens. they are characterized by the expression of specific cell surface receptors, and distinct transcription factors that lead to the secretion of a particular set of cytokines  <cit> . for example, th <dig> cells express the transcription factor t-bet and secrete ifn-γ, tnf-α and il- <dig>  they also express the chemokine receptors ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig> and the cytokine receptors il-12rβ <dig> and il-18rα. th <dig> cells play an important role in the resistance against intracellular pathogens and in the pathogenesis and maintenance of certain autoimmune diseases  <cit> . another th subset, th <dig> cells, express the transcription factor rorγt, secrete il-17a, il-17f and il- <dig> and are characterized by the expression of the chemokine receptor ccr <dig>  the cytokine receptors il-23r and il-1r <dig> and the c-type lectin receptor cd <dig>  th <dig> cells play a very important role in the defense against extracellular pathogens and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases  <cit> . other th subsets include th <dig>  t follicular helper  and induced regulatory t  cells  <cit> . the classical view of distinct and terminally differentiated lineages is currently challenged by many findings showing a degree of plasticity and flexibility in the th subsets that can be represented as a series of transitions from less to more stable states  <cit> . furthermore, there are many cd4+ t cells that do not fit the profile of the subsets described above in that they produce cytokines ascribed to more than one lineage. for instance, some human il-17a or il- <dig> producing cells were found to also produce ifn-γ  <cit> . additionally, th subsets can also be subdivided according to the expression of cell surface receptors. we have previously reported that the expression of cd300a/c distinguishes a subset of th <dig> cells that is more polyfunctional and, after stimulation, up-regulates the t-box transcription factor eomesodemin  <cit> .

cd300a is an immunomodulatory receptor that belongs to the cd <dig> family of activating/inhibitory receptors  <cit> . it is a type i transmembrane receptor that has three classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs  and one non-classical itim in its cytoplasmic tail and a single v-like ig extracellular domain. this receptor is expressed on cells of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages and the ligand is not known  <cit> . several in vitro studies have shown that cd300a ligation is capable of inhibiting the eosinophil response to eotaxin and il- <dig>  <cit> , nk cell mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> , b cell receptor  mediated ca2+ mobilization and nfat translocation  <cit> , fcεri mediated activation of mast cells  <cit>  and fcγriia mediated ca2+ flux and reactive oxygen species  production in neutrophils  <cit> . in vivo studies have also shown the inhibitory potential of cd300a. for instance, treatment of mice with a bispecific antibody linking ccr <dig> to cd300a reversed remodeling and airway inflammation in a model of asthma  <cit> . furthermore, genetic studies have revealed that a non-synonymous mutation in the cd300a extracellular domain is linked to psoriasis susceptibility  <cit>  and that is implicated in the development of alzheimer's disease  <cit> . other studies have shown that circulating cd4+cd45ro+ t cells exhibit lower expression of cd300a/c in psoriasis patients compared with healthy donors  <cit> . the expression of cd300a/c is also down-regulated in b cells from hiv infected patients, suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the b cell dysfunction observed in hiv induced immunodeficiency  <cit> . cd300a, along with three other genes, has been identified as a blood biomarker that can be used for the differentiation of patients with ulcerative colitis from patients with crohn's disease and noninflammatory diarrhea  <cit> .

it has been previously shown by real time pcr that both receptors, cd300a and cd300c, are expressed on human cd4+ t cells  <cit> . however, with the available monoclonal antibodies it is impossible to distinguish cd300a from cd300c on the cell surface  <cit> . the extracellular domains of cd300a and cd300c are highly homologous, showing 80% identity  <cit> . while the transmembrane region of cd300c contains a charged amino acid that is important for its association with the immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motif  bearing fcεrγ chain, and therefore delivers activating signals  <cit> , cd300a, as mentioned above, transmits inhibitory signals through the itims containing intracellular tail  <cit> .

in this report, using the anti-cd300a/c e <dig>  mab, we show that cd300a/c is preferentially expressed on cd4+ effector memory t  cells. we show that cd4+ t cells producing only il-17a are mostly cd300a/c- while cd4+ cells producing il-17a in combination with other cytokines, such as ifn-γ, tnf-α and/or il- <dig> are mostly cd300a/c+. furthermore, we investigate the ability of cd300a/c receptors to modulate tcr mediated ca2+ flux and ifn-γ production of th <dig> polarized cells.

RESULTS
cd300a/c is highly expressed on tem cd4+ t cells
a recent manuscript has reported that cd300a and cd300c are impossible to distinguish on the cell surface, using a panel of mabs  <cit> . therefore, we first tested the binding specificity of the e <dig>  mab, an antibody previously described as cd300a specific  <cit> . our results showed that this antibody recognizes both cd300a and cd300c receptors on transiently transfected 293t cells . consequently, hereafter we will refer as cd300a/c+ to cells that specifically bind the e <dig>  mab.

we have previously published that naïve cd4+ t cells express low amounts of cd300a/c, whereas memory cd4+ t cells can be subdivided into cd300a/c+ and cd300a/c- populations  <cit> . however, it is not known if within the memory cd4+ t cells there are differences in the expression of cd300a/c between the cd4+ effector memory  and central memory  cells. we used three staining strategies to delineate the expression of cd300a/c by tem and tcm cd4+ t cells. each one of these strategies is based on the combination of two markers: cd45ra and ccr <dig>  <cit> , cd45ro and cd62l  <cit> , or cd45ro and cd <dig>  <cit> . our results show that tem cells, characterized by the phenotype cd45ra-ccr7-, cd45ro+cd62l- or cd45ro+cd27-, are predominantly cd300a/c+ , whereas tcm cells, defined by the phenotype cd45ra-ccr7+, cd45ro+cd62l+ or cd45ro+cd27+, have similar percentage of cd300a/c+ and cd300a/c- cells .

cd300a/c expression in cytokine producing tcm and tem cd4+ t cells
cell surface receptors have been used as markers to identify different th subsets. while not exclusive, expression of cxcr <dig> and ccr <dig> is associated with th <dig> cells  <cit> ; ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and crth <dig> with th <dig> cells  <cit> ; and ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and cd <dig> with th <dig> cells  <cit> . we have previously found that ifn-γ  producing cells are predominantly cd300a/c+ and that both il- <dig>  and il-17a  producing cd4+ t cells are equally distributed between the cd300a/c+ and cd300a/c- subsets  <cit> . to determine if cd300a/c expression could be utilized to further discriminate among th subsets, we tested for the expression of cd300a/c in tcm and tem cytokine producing cells. in these experiments, we classified cd4+ memory cells as those expressing cd45ro and cd <dig> because these markers remained stably expressed after the in vitro stimulation with pma and ionomycin, whereas the expression of other receptors such as cd62l decreases  <cit> . results in figure 2a show that ifn-γ producing cells in both the tcm  and the tem  subsets are mainly cd300a/c+. on the other hand, tcm cells that produce il- <dig> were only slightly enriched in the cd300a/c+ subset, whereas the tem il- <dig> producing cells showed no tendency to express or not express cd300a/c. tem cells that produce il-17a expressed somewhat less cd300a/c, whereas the tcm il-17a producing cells showed no tendency to express or not express cd300a/c. analysis for il- <dig> and tnf-α production demonstrated that tcm cells producing these cytokines tend to be cd300a/c+ .

cd300a/c is differentially expressed by cd4+ t cells that produce ifn-γ and il-17a
our results show that cells that produce ifn-γ are mostly cd300a/c+ , while more il-17a producing cells are cd300a/c-. several studies have shown that there is a significant portion of cells that produce both cytokines  <cit> . given the association between ifn-γ production and cd300a/c expression, we reasoned that the production of ifn-γ by some il-17a producing cells could account for the presence of il-17a producing cells in the cd300a/c+ subset. in fact, we observed that the ifn-γ+il-17a+ cells are enriched in the cd300a/c+ subset at levels similar to the percentage present for ifn-γ+il-17a- cells, while the ifn-γ-il-17a+ cells tend to be cd300a/c- . in agreement with our observation of the correlation between cd300a/c expression and ifn-γ production  <cit> , we also observed that cells in the cd300a/c+il-17a- subset produce the largest amounts of ifn-γ and the cd300a/c+ifn-γ+ subset produce the lowest levels of il-17a on a per cell basis, as indicated by the mean fluorescence intensity  . the mfi of cytokine staining is a value known to be correlated with the amount of cytokine produced by a t cell  <cit> . this, together with our previously published results  <cit> , indicates that cd300a/c expression is a marker for cells that produce ifn-γ. corroboratively, we observed that ifn-γ+il-17a+ cells are predominately cd300a/c+ . similar to ifn-γ, tnf-α production is also correlated with cd300a/c expression when both tnf-α and il-17a production were analyzed and the tnf-α-il-17a+ cells tend to be cd300a/c- .

we further explored the notion that cells producing il-17a alone tend to be cd300a/c-. to do this, we analyzed cd300a/c expression on cd4+ cells producing il-17a alone or in combination with two other cytokines . we analyzed cells that produce il-17a, ifn-γ and tnf-α , il-17a, ifn-γ and il- <dig>  and cells that produce il-17a, tnf-α and il- <dig> . we found that cells producing il-17a alone tend to be cd300a/c-, whereas cells producing il-17a plus one or two additional cytokines tend to be less cd300a/c-. more importantly, we found that the il-17a producing cells that also produce ifn-γ tend to be enriched in the cd300a/c+ subset .

ligation of cd300a/c with the e <dig>  mab modulates tcr mediated signals on human cd4+ t cells
human cd300a and cd300c are two highly homologous receptors expressed on cells of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages with opposing signaling capabilities  <cit> . ligation of these receptors with mab is known to modulate activation signals on a variety of cells, including nk cells, neutrophils, mast cells, b cells and eosinophils  <cit> . although several studies have shown that cd300a/c+ and cd300a/c- cd4+ t cells have different features  <cit> , to our knowledge there is no report addressing the modulatory role of ligating cd300a and cd300c on tcr mediated signaling. to determine if cd300a/c are capable of regulating human t cell activation signals, we generated cd4+ t cell lines from healthy donors that express high levels of this receptor and measured intracellular ca2+ flux. co-ligation of tcr and cd300a/c with mabs resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular ca2+ flux, indicating that cd300a/c ligation down-modulates tcr mediated signals . given that ifn-γ producing cells tend to be cd300a/c+ we asked the question if ligation of cd300a/c with the e <dig>  mab can modulate the production of this cytokine in response to tcr stimulation. to do this, we polarized purified cd4+ t cells under th <dig> conditions and tested for ifn-γ production. results shown in table  <dig> illustrate that compared with ligation of the tcr alone, co-ligation of the tcr and cd300a/c inhibited tcr mediated production of ifn-γ by cd4+ t cells from three separate donors, but increased the number of ifn-γ+ cells in two donors. these results demonstrate that ligation of cd300a/c with the e <dig>  mab is capable of modulating tcr mediated responses.

discussion
for the past 10- <dig> years, a remarkable effort has been dedicated to the comprehensive phenotypic and functional characterization of human t cell subsets  <cit> . in addition to the cytokines that cd4+ t cell subsets secrete, they also express a relatively specific pattern of chemokine receptors. for instance, while ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig> expression is associated with th <dig> cells  <cit> , ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> expression is associated with th <dig> cells  <cit> . in general, the association between the expression of cell surface receptors and intracellular cytokines implies that t cell subsets exhibit differential requirements for effector functions, homing potential, survival and stimulation. however, it should be noted that the broad correlation between cell surface receptor expression and cytokine production patterns is far from perfect  <cit> . furthermore, the existence of cd4+ t cells that are able to produce two or more cytokines ascribed to different lineages complicates the classical view of distinct subsets  <cit> . another important question, that recently is under intense investigation, is one of t cell plasticity or flexibility, implying that cd4+ t cell subsets are more appropriately viewed as works in progress rather than terminally differentiated cells  <cit> . for instance, studies in humans have shown the plasticity of th <dig> cells and their ability to switch into th <dig> cells, a process that is mediated by il- <dig>  <cit> . cell plasticity or flexibility may arise from heterogeneous populations or, alternatively, from flexible genetic programs  <cit> .

in addition to chemokine receptors, other cell surface markers have been ascribed to specific cd4+ t cell subsets. for instance, all human th <dig> cells express cd <dig>  <cit> . also, we have previously reported that in peripheral blood the majority of ifn-γ producing cells are cd300a/c+, although there was a degree of variability  <cit> . nevertheless, the th <dig> cells that are cd300a/c+ are characterized by their higher production of ifn-γ on a per cell basis and their tendency to be polyfunctional in regard to cytokine production  <cit> . one of the most groundbreaking classifications of memory t cells was proposed by sallusto and colleagues. they identified two subsets, tcm and tem cells, that are distinguished according to the surface expression of cd45ra and ccr <dig>  <cit> . our results show that both tem and tcm cd4+ t cells can be further subdivided into two subsets based in their cd300a/c expression. we have found that tem cd4+ t cells have a higher frequency of cd300a/c+ cells than tcm cd4+ t cells. the finding that memory cd4+ t cells can be divided into two populations based on their level of cd300a/c expression raises the possibility of a functional dichotomy related to the level of this expression. in fact we show that cd300a/c+ cells, both in the tcm and tem subsets, harbor a higher frequency of ifn-γ producing cells than the cd300a/c- tem and tcm cd4+ t cells, which is in agreement with our previous published results showing that th <dig> cells are mostly, but not entirely cd300a/c+  <cit> . analysis of il- <dig> and tnf-α producing cells also show that cd300a/c+ cells show a higher frequency of cytokine producing cells, although this increase is restricted to the tcm cd4+ cells. on the other hand, the cd300a/c- subset in the tem cd4+ t cells tends to have a higher number of il-17a producing cells than the cd300a/c+ cells. in light of this differential cd300a/c expression in the ifn-γ and il-17a producing cells, we decided to study the expression of this marker on il-17a producing cells in more detail. our results show two important findings: first that in ex vivo stimulated peripheral blood cd4+ t cells from healthy donors the ifn-γ producing cells are mostly cd300a/c+, independently if they produce only ifn-γ or ifn-γ plus il-17a; and second that, on a per cell basis, the higher ifn-γ producers are cd300a/c+ and do not produce il-17a at the same time, while the lower il-17a producers are cd300a/c+ and produce at the same time ifn-γ. this suggests that the ifn-γ and il-17a higher producers cells are mostly, although not entirely, exclusive and that this correlates with the cell surface expression of cd300a/c. in addition to other factors, this probably reflects the effect of tgf-β <dig> in vivo, as this cytokine has been shown to down-regulate cd300a/c expression and ifn-γ production, while it is important for the generation of th <dig> cells  <cit> . although additional studies are required to further define cd300a/c+ and cd300a/c- th <dig> and th <dig> cells, to elucidate for example the degree of plasticity or flexibility of the two th <dig> cell subsets, our observation that cd300a/c is differentially expressed on these subsets adds another layer of complexity to the growing field of human th cell subsets  <cit> .

here we show that cross-linking of cd300a/c and tcr with mabs is capable of modulating signals evoked by tcr ligation alone. results presented in table  <dig> show that co-ligation of the tcr and cd300a/c inhibited tcr mediated ifn-γ production on polarized th <dig> cells in three donors while there was an increase in the frequency of ifn-γ+ cells in two donors. these results are reminiscent of those published by lankry et al  <cit> . these authors showed that cd300a is indeed an inhibitory receptor able to inhibit human nk cell mediated killing, despite the fact that some nk cell clones were not inhibited in a cd300a dependent manner. they proposed that the absence of the inhibitory signal on those clones was probably due to the presence of cd300c on nk cells that was also recognized and ligated by the same mabs they used  <cit> . we believe that this potential ligation of either receptor also may account for the results we have obtained, since we have found that the e <dig>  mab recognizes cd300a and cd300c . both receptors were previously shown to be expressed on human cd4+ t cells, at least at the transcript levels  <cit> . furthermore, the recent discovery that cd300c is able to interact and form heterocomplexes with other members of the cd <dig> family, including cd300a, adds another degree of complexity in the signaling pathways that emanate from these two receptors  <cit> . human cd4+ t cells express cd300a and cd300c  <cit>  and it may be expected that, depending on the relative expression of each one of these receptors, the signaling outcome after ligation with anti-cd300a/c mabs, could be different depending on the donors. clearly, further investigation is required to be done in this regard, and the generation of extensively tested specific mabs that are able of discriminating both cd300a and cd300c is necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we show that ex vivo isolated human th <dig> and th <dig> cells differentially express cd300a/c, probably reflecting the different requirements for the in vivo generation of both th subsets. moreover, we show for the first time that ligation of cd300a and cd300c with the e <dig>  mab has an immunomodulatory role on human cd4+ t cells as revealed by its ability to modulate tcr mediated ca2+ flux and ifn-γ production. better understanding of the role of the different th subsets based on their cd300a/c expression might be useful for innovative drug development and disease management in the future.
