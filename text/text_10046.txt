BACKGROUND
the genomic information and evolution of the mitochondrial genomes of metazoans is well documented. knowledge on the evolution of mitochondrial dna  in single-celled organisms on the other hand is more scarce. in order to promote the understaning of the mitochondrial genome evolution of single-celled eukaryotes, it is necessary to fill the large existing gaps of knowledge and data. for example only few ciliate mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced until today, most of them belonging to the genus tetrahymena: t. pyriformis  <cit> , t. thermophila  <cit> , t. pigmentosa, t. malacensis, t. paravorax  <cit> . while the newest sequence belongs to euplotes minuta  <cit> , p. tetraurelia has been among the first unicellular eukaryotes, for which the complete mitochondrial genome sequence was determined  <cit> . therefore, to fill in one of the above mentioned gaps, we decided to sequence the mitochondrial genome of p. caudatum, a close relative of the p. aurelia species complex, in order to elucidate the mitochondrial genome evolution within this important ciliate genus.

two interesting aspects of ciliate mtdna are predominant and have made the assembly of mitochondrial genomes difficult. first, all hitherto known ciliate mitochondrial genomes are linear, from  <dig> kb  to  <dig> kb  long, and contain some  <dig> tightly packed genes without introns. second, for about half of the open reading frames  in the ciliate mtdna, a definite protein function is unknown, because there is not enough similarity to known proteins in other organisms  <cit> . among these orfs, ymf <dig> in the tetrahymena mtdna is particularly unusual. this gene is ~ <dig>  amino acid residues long, shows extreme sequence divergence among tetrahymena species and has no homolog in the p. tetraurelia or euplotes mitochondrial genomes.

paramecium and tetrahymena belong to the class oligohymenophorea, one out of eleven lineages within the phylum ciliophora. despite similarities in gene content and genome organization in p. tetraurelia and tetrahymena mtdna, there are great differences in the nucleotide composition. all studied tetrahymena mitochondrial genomes have a guanine and cytosine  content of ~20%, whereas in p. tetraurelia, the g+c content is more than twice as high . paramecium tetraurelia and t. thermophila are model organisms, whose macronuclear genome sequences have been recently completed  <cit> . interestingly, the nuclear g+c contents are not significantly different in both species . this raises the question of whether the high mitochondrial g+c content observed in p. tetraurelia is a characteristic property of paramecium mtdna, or an exception of the ciliate mitochondrial genomes known so far.

to test this question, we determined the mitochondrial genome sequence of p. caudatum and compared its gene content and sequence properties to the closely related p. tetraurelia.

RESULTS
general characterization
the mitochondrial genome of paramecium caudatum has been described as a linear molecule of 40- <dig> kb  <cit> . we determined  <dig>  bp of the genome sequence , excluding only the terminal repeat regions that usually flank the linear ciliate mtdna. the overall nucleotide composition was  <dig> % g,  <dig> % a,  <dig> % t, and  <dig> % c, the g+c content thereby being significantly lower than that of p. tetraurelia mtdna . the coding part of the genome was  <dig>  bp , the protein-coding part  <dig>  bp  in length. we determined  <dig> protein-coding genes with known function,  <dig> additional orfs with unknown function, the small and large subunits of the ribosomal rna genes and three transfer rna genes . genes in the p. caudatum mitochondrial genome were densely packed, with short intergenic spacers . however, the intergenic regions adjacent to the cox <dig> and cob genes were considerably longer . an overview of all protein-coding genes and a comparison with the p. tetraurelia mtdna is given in table  <dig> 

the sequence identity values were calculated from amino acid sequences. the ka/ks ratio was estimated using the method of goldman and yang  <cit>  as implemented in the program ka/ks_calculator  <cit> .

a yejr, rps <dig>  ymf <dig> and ymf <dig> were considerably longer in the mtdna of p. caudatum. for comparative analyses the sequences were adjusted to the gene length in p. tetraurelia.

b ymf <dig>  ymf <dig>  ymf <dig> and ymf <dig> each appear to be equivalent to two adjacent orfs in p. tetraurelia. comparative data are omitted.

c ymf <dig> was only found in p. caudatum

d rps <dig> in p. tetraurelia was annotated during the present work

the amino acid sequences of genes with known function were more similar between paramecium species than sequences of the putative orfs, with atp <dig> and nad <dig> being the most conserved genes . the ratio of nonsynonymous vs. synonymous substitutions  also differed, with ka/ks values being significantly higher in putative orfs than in known genes . an exception was the rpl <dig> gene, which possessed the highest ka/ks value among all protein-coding genes in paramecium mtdna, although it was still well within the range indicative for purifying selection .

nucleotide composition and codon usage
nucleotide composition and codon usage of the newly determined p. caudatum mitochondrial genome were compared to the previously published mitochondrial genomes of p. tetraurelia  and t. pyriformis . in p. caudatum, the g+c content of the protein-coding genes was similar to the g+c content of t. pyriformis , but much lower than that of p. tetraurelia . this difference was even more pronounced at 3rd codon positions, with  <dig> % g or c ending codons in p. tetraurelia and only  <dig> % and  <dig> % g or c ending codons in p. caudatum and t. pyriformis, respectively. the g+c content of the noncoding regions  was slightly lower compared to protein-coding genes in all species, but the relative differences between species were similar . in the mitochondrial rrna genes, on the other hand, the g+c content differed only slightly among the ciliates .

t. p. tetrahymena pyriformis , p. c. paramecium caudatum , p. t. paramecium tetraurelia , values are given in percent.

in order to gain further insight into the nucleotide composition of the paramecium mtdna, we sequenced a  <dig> bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit  <dig> gene  from  <dig> more paramecium species. a phylogenetic tree of paramecium based on sequences of the cox <dig> gene is shown in figure 2b. the analysis of the nucleotide composition at 3rd codon positions of the cox <dig> gene revealed high g+c values  in species of the p. aurelia complex and a low g+c content  in the remaining paramecia .

the codon usage bias  differed significantly between p. caudatum and p. tetraurelia . only in one out of  <dig> amino acids  the same codon  was the most frequently used synonymous codon in p. caudatum and p. tetraurelia, whereas p. caudatum and t. pyriformis shared the most frequently used codon in  <dig> amino acids. the type of preferred codons was related to the nucleotide composition of the respective species . generally, for p. caudatum and t. pyriformis a/t ending synonymous codons were abundant. this was also true for the stop codons, as only taa was detected to terminate protein-coding genes in p. caudatum and tetrahymena, whereas tag never occurred . in p. tetraurelia mtdna, on the other hand, the codon usage was shifted against g/c ending codons. only in two amino acids  the most frequent synonymous codon ended in a or t . furthermore, both the number of rare codons and the effective number of codons  indicate a more balanced usage of synonymous codons in p. tetraurelia compared to the other ciliates . a higher nc in p. tetraurelia was found for all protein-coding genes and putative orfs, except nad <dig> .

bold values indicate the most frequent synonymous codons for each amino acid and species, italic values indicate rare codons. the overall number of rare codons  and the effective number of codons  are also given for each species.

gene content and gene order
gene composition, gene order and transcriptional orientation were essentially the same as in p. tetraurelia  <cit> . most of the few observed differences between p. caudatum and p. tetraurelia could be attributed to sequencing or annotation errors in the p. tetraurelia mtdna. for example, the small gene rps <dig> was not described in p. tetraurelia neither in the original publication nor in the re-annotation paper  <cit> . we determined rps <dig> in the newly sequenced p. caudatum mitochondrial genome as well as in p. tetraurelia at the same relative position  where it is located in all tetrahymena species  <cit> . the mitochondrial genome of p. caudatum contained one orf  that was not present in p. tetraurelia . furthermore, we determined five orfs in p. caudatum, each of which seems to be equivalent to two adjacent orfs in p. tetraurelia. four of these orfs  are also present in tetrahymena mtdna  <cit> . the fifth orf refers to the heme maturase gene , which was much larger than p. tetraurelia yejr , but similar to tetrahymena  and euplotes minuta yejr   <cit> . in p. tetraurelia, ymf <dig> is located directly downstream to the yejr gene  <cit> . in p. caudatum, however, ymf <dig> was not present at this position or anywhere else in the mitochondrial genome . these results could indicate sequencing errors in the p. tetraurelia mitochondrial genome, which led to several frameshifts and premature stopcodons in the annotated sequence.

the most striking difference compared to p. tetraurelia was ymf <dig>  a large open reading frame of  <dig>  bp length . the c-terminal part of this orf showed significant similarity to ymf <dig> of p. tetraurelia and tetrahymena  and to the c-terminal part of rps <dig> in euplotes. the largest part of the gene, however, consisted of an n-terminal extension. the analysis revealed one transmembrane region from amino acid  <dig>  to  <dig> , with the alignable c-terminal part  lying inside and the large extension lying outside of the membrane. blast searches of this extension detected no sequence similarity with any known sequence in genbank.

besides its size, ymf <dig> possessed another unusual feature: an intragenic minisatellite, composed of nine repeat units of  <dig> bp close to the middle of the orf. we amplified and sequenced this gene region from  <dig> further p. caudatum strains and found the repeat number to be highly variable, even between strains sharing the same cox <dig> haplotype . we identified  <dig> length variants with repeat numbers ranging from six to  <dig> units. no length polymorphism  was detected within individual p. caudatum strains. the repeat was imperfect as we found differences  between the repeat units within one sequence as well as variations between different strains. however, these sequence variations never led to nonsense mutations. since the repeat unit size was a multiple of three nucleotides, length variation in the repeat region did not cause a frameshift in the gene and left the reading frame intact.

discussion
codon usage
closely related species usually show similar nucleotide composition and codon usage patterns. for example, five tetrahymena species possess very similar mitochondrial g+c contents , whereas t. pyriformis, p. tetraurelia and e. minuta differ significantly in this respect . therefore, it was unexpected that nucleotide composition and codon usage of p. caudatum mtdna were much more similar to tetrahymena than to the congeneric p. tetraurelia.

phylogenetic relationships within the genus paramecium are well studied  <cit> . in a species phylogeny based on 18s rrna data, p. caudatum and the p. aurelia species complex are closely related and belong to the "p. aurelia subgroup"  <cit> . this was also supported by the tree based on cox <dig> sequences . taken into consideration the phylogenetic position of p. tetraurelia, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that a low g+c content and the preference for a/t ending codons represent the ancestral state in the genus paramecium. an increased g+c content in combination with the preference for g/c ending codons would be a derived condition in p. aurelia mtdna. no further complete paramecium mitochondrial genomes were available to test this hypothesis. we analyzed the nucleotide composition in a fragment of the cox <dig> gene, which can be used as an indicator for the overall mitochondrial g+c content  <cit> . these sequences supported the above hypothesis, since the shift in the nucleotide composition obviously took place in the lineage leading to the p. aurelia species complex . of course, this cox <dig> data set contained only few of the  <dig> known p. aurelia species, and for a conclusive statement all relevant species should be included. but in this context, please note that  <cit>  and  <cit>  obtained dna sequences from different mitochondrial genes of all p. aurelia species and these data suggest that the increased mitochondrial g+c content is a consistent pattern throughout the species complex. the observed shift in the nucleotide composition of p. tetraurelia mtdna was associated with a significantly reduced cub. the cub in p. caudatum mtdna, exemplified by the effective number of codons, was similar to t. pyriformis and other single-celled eukaryotes such as chlamydomonas  <cit> . p. tetraurelia, on the other hand, had a much lower cub  in nearly all genes . these differences in base composition and cub were not reflected in the derived amino acid composition, which was similar for all the compared species . this suggests strong purifying selection on the mitochondrial amino acid composition in p. tetraurelia.

the causes for this large shift in g+c content and codon usage in p. tetraurelia mtdna are unknown. in a recent publication, the complete macronuclear genome sequences of p. tetraurelia and t. thermophila were compared  <cit> . the authors observed very similar nucleotide composition and codon usage patterns in both species. thus, whatever caused the shift in the p. tetraurelia mitochondrial genome seems to have only affected mtdna and not nuclear dna. furthermore, the altered nucleotide composition was observed for both protein-coding and noncoding regions , indicating that the increased g+c content is not the consequence of selection for either a higher expression level of p. tetraurelia mitochondrial genes, or towards certain codons. possible explanations for the increased g+c content in the p. tetraurelia mitochondrial genome are discussed below.

a high g+c content could be an adaptation to temperature, uv exposure or other environmental conditions that require a high dna stability  <cit>  . although the presently available data suggest that some p. aurelia species may be restricted to certain biogeographic regions  <cit> , there is no evidence for p. tetraurelia generally preferring higher temperatures than p. caudatum. in fact, both species often co-occur and have to cope with similar environmental conditions  <cit> .

the observed pattern in p. tetraurelia mtdna could as well be the consequence of neutral processes like biased gene conversion  or a general change in mutation pressure from at towards gc. a neutral process being the underlying mechanism is in concordance with the observation that the g+c content in p. tetraurelia mtdna was highest at most neutrally evolving sites . in more constrained mtdna regions , the base composition of p. tetraurelia was not significantly different from p. caudatum . however, this observation is not per se evidence for neutrality of the underlying mechanism. it is in principle also consistent with an adaptive process in combination with strong selective pressure on the amino acid composition.

bgc is a gc biased repair process in genome regions that undergo recombination and has been identified as a major drive in genome evolution  <cit> . gene conversion has been suggested as recombinational mechanism in the mitochondrial genome of the killifish kryptolebias marmoratus  <cit> , and as an explanation for the exceptionally high mitochondrial g+c content in the green alga polytomella capuana  <cit> . previous studies using mtdna found no evidence for recombination events among p. aurelia species  <cit> . it is, nevertheless, possible that such a mechanism has played a role in the evolutionary history of the p. aurelia complex.

in this context it is interesting to note, that a whole genome duplication  has occurred in the common ancestor of the p. aurelia complex  <cit> . a significantly reduced cub was also found in nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes of saccharomyces species, which experienced a wgd  <cit> . to our knowledge, the influence of a wgd on the mitochondrial genome has not been investigated. it is tempting to speculate that the wgd influenced the crosstalk between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes .

in conclusion, the observed picture is best explained by a hitherto unknown  mechanism that increased the g+c content in p. aurelia mtdna on the one hand, and strong purifying selection on the ancestral amino acid composition on the other hand. these contradicting forces are counterbalanced by a considerably altered codon usage pattern.

gene content and sequence evolution compared to p. tetraurelia
the size of the p. caudatum mitochondrial genome was within the range predicted from earlier rflp analyses  <cit>  and ~10% longer than the mitochondrial genome of p. tetraurelia  <cit> . this difference was primarily due to the presence of the large open reading frame ymf <dig> in p. caudatum .

we found one unique orf  in p. caudatum, which was not present in p. tetraurelia. this is in contrast to tetrahymena, where complete synteny among five phylogenetically diverse tetrahymena species was observed, except for some rare gene duplications  <cit> .

the existence of many orfs of unknown function is a general problem in protist mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . likewise, for about half of the protein-coding mitochondrial genes in ciliates no definite function can be assigned  <cit> . one main objective of studies obtaining new ciliate mitochondrial genomes is therefore the annotation of these unknown ymf genes. unfortunately we failed to assign any function to hitherto unknown genes, which is most likely due to the high evolutionary rate of ciliate mtdna. this problem even challenged the alignment of some orfs from the closely related p. caudatum and p. tetraurelia. for example, in ymf <dig> only 33% of the amino acids were identical among both species. therefore, blast searches as well as manual alignments could not determine a possible equivalent of this gene in tetrahymena. the authors of the t. pyriformis mtdna study suggested a possible homology of paramecium ymf <dig> and t. pyriformis ymf <dig> based on gene size and position   <cit> . the recently published mitochondrial genome sequence of the rather distantly related euplotes minuta confirmed this suggestion, as this conserved gene order was also found in euplotes  <cit> .

in general, evolutionary rates are governed by negative  selection, neutrality or positive  selection. the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates  allows an estimation of the selective constraint on a given gene. values < <dig> are indicative for purifying selection, whereas values > <dig> indicate diversifying selection  <cit> . ka/ks values of the protein-coding genes in the paramecium mtdna were generally < <dig>  indicating that purifying selection is acting on all genes.

the genes with high sequence similarities between p. caudatum and p. tetraurelia also had low ka/ks values. this may indicate that the selective optimum for those genes is similar in the compared species. an exception to this trend was the ribosomal protein gene rpl <dig>  whose ka/ks ratio indicates a relaxed selective constraint in combination with moderate sequence divergence. in tetrahymena, no elevated ka/ks ratios were observed for this gene  <cit> . in the present study, putative orfs had significantly  higher ka/ks values compared to known protein-coding genes, indicating a lower selective pressure on those non-annotated genes. similar results were obtained in a study comparing t. pyriformis and t. thermophila  <cit> . furthermore, these authors supposed that the high divergence of putative orfs causes difficulties to detect homologous genes through similarity searches. some of the putative orfs in paramecium, however, had low ka/ks values and a relatively high sequence similarity in p. caudatum and p. tetraurelia . it is surprising that for these genes, which are conserved within ciliates and seem to be under notable selective pressure, no homologs could be detected in other organisms.

ymf64
the most conspicuous feature in the p. caudatum mtdna was a large n-terminal extension of ymf <dig> compared to the previously published ciliate mitochondrial genomes. this was also the main reason for the length difference between the mitochondrial genomes of p. tetraurelia and p. caudatum . an initial pcr survey revealed that the large gene extension was not present in the mitochondrial genomes of three further members of the p. aurelia complex , p. multimicronucleatum, p. nephridiatum and p. putrinum . these results together with the phylogenetic analysis  suggest that this gene extension is a unique feature of p. caudatum rather than an ancestral feature that was lost in p. tetraurelia. the c-terminal part of ymf <dig> also showed similarity to the c-terminal part of a gene that was annotated as rps <dig> in euplotes . interestingly, also in euplotes this gene possesses a large n-terminal extension, although it is smaller than in p. caudatum   <cit> . the size of ymf <dig> resembles ymf <dig> in the tetrahymena mtdna, which is approximately  <dig>  amino acids long  <cit> . however, besides the gene length no other similarities could be detected. the existence of two remarkably large but unrelated mitochondrial genes in two relatively closely related ciliate genera is surprising and needs further study. we are currently investigating the sequence and length variation of ymf <dig> in p. caudatum and will furthermore apply rt-pcr analyses to test whether the gene is expressed in full length.

the length variable repeat in the middle of ymf <dig> is the first report of an intragenic mitochondrial minisatellite in ciliates. variable number tandem repeats  or minisatellites are common in the mtdna of many different organisms, especially metazoans  <cit> . the high variability  is supposed to occur through slipped strand mispairing during mtdna replication. in most cases these vntrs are located in or adjacent to the noncoding mitochondrial control region. to our knowledge, an intragenic mitochondrial minisatellite has been reported only from a gene of unknown function in the oomycete phytophthora sojae  <cit> . on the other hand, minisatellites encoding nuclear sequences are not unusual. genes containing polymorphic repeat elements are capable to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions or to generate new functions. this is of special importance in developmental genes of multicellular organisms  <cit>  and in cell wall/surface proteins of unicellular prokaryotes  <cit>  and eukaryotes  <cit>  based on the present data, however, it is not possible to suggest a potential function for the repeat region within ymf <dig> 

minisatellites have been useful for the investigation of population structure and phylogeographic patterns and also for the identification of individual organisms or clones  <cit> . only recently, mtdna sequences have been successfully applied as genetic markers for the investigation of intraspecific variation in ciliates  <cit> . in one of these studies several polymorphic cox <dig> haplotypes were observed among natural isolates of p. caudatum and p. multimicronucleatum, which reflected no clear geographic structure  <cit> . the ymf <dig> repeat region proved to be polymorphic in different p. caudatum isolates that share the same cox <dig> haplotype . this indicates a higher evolutionary rate of this sequence region. further analyses including more isolates will show whether the ymf <dig> minisatellite has potential as a genetic marker for paramecium.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study was to compare the mitochondrial genome sequence of paramecium caudatum to the previously published mtdna of p. tetraurelia. while gene order and gene content were very similar in both species, the analysis revealed that nucleotide composition and codon usage bias of the p. caudatum mtdna differed greatly from p. tetraurelia. the g+c content of the p. tetraurelia mtdna was nearly twice as high as in p. caudatum  and the codon usage bias was much lower . unexpectedly, the effective number of codons in the p. caudatum mitochondrial genome, is more similar to the distantly related t. pyriformis and other single-celled eukaryotes such as chlamydomonas, than to the closely related p. tetraurelia. the analysis of cox <dig> data from additional paramecium species showed that the shift towards a higher mitochondrial g+c content took place in the lineage leading to the p. aurelia species complex. the reasons for this shift are presently unknown and future studies will investigate whether this is linked to the whole genome duplication that occurred in the common ancestor of the p. aurelia complex.
